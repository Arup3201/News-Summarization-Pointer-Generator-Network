If you're a billionaire oil tycoon and it's your birthday, a Colin the Caterpillar cake just isn't going to cut it.

Hiring a pop star to perform at your private party is more like it, which is what Kazakh energy boss Kairat Boranbeyev is said to have done to celebrate his birthday in London this week.

Mr Boranbayev reportedly paid former Pussycat Doll and X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger 'in excess of £100,000' to play a private gig for him at his house in Mayfair on Sunday night.

The 36-year-old American pop star was chauffeured from her hotel in London's West End to Mr Boranbeyev's home near Berkeley Square, where she spent more than three hours performing hits such as Don't Cha and Your Love to a small group of his family and friends.

Earlier in the day Scherzinger, whose boyfriend is motor racing star Lewis Hamilton, had taken a picture of herself rehearsing at the house with her friends Natalie Romero and Nigerian performer, Diddi, as well as her tan and white English bulldog, Roscoe.

The singer wasn't the only pop star at the businessman's birthday party - Russian Eurovision singer Dima Bilan and Mitya Fomin were also there, as well as Kazakh pop star Baigali Serkebayev, from the popular group A Studio.

Mr Boranbayev, who was pictured standing with a group including Mr Serkebayev on the pop star's Instagram feed, is well known in his native Kazakhstan, where he ran Russian-Kazakh oil and gas firm, KazRosGas LLP, for eight years until his resignation earlier this year.

The oligarch, who was one of the firm's founding partners, said he wished to pursue new business opportunities after his time at KazRosGas.

He is a keen football fan and one-time owner of Kazakh's most famous football side, FC Kairat.

And he is no stranger to hiring pop stars to help him celebrate.  When his daughter Alima Boranbayeva married the Kazakh president's grandson, Aysultan Nazarbayev a year ago, the happy couple were said to have paid singer Kanye West $3million to perform at the wedding.

After helping Mr Boranbayev celebrate his birthday, Miss Scherzinger went on to Boujis nightclub in London's South Kensington, where she left the VIP area to dance with clubbers on the main dancefloor.

As well as her successful gig for the Kazakh, she was celebrating her boyfriend's win at the Singapore Grand Prix with shots of tequila and vodka, before leaving the club at 3am and getting into a car with two of her female dancers.

After changing out of her silver sequinned dress into a patterned jumpsuit, Miss Scherzinger was later seen taking her dog for a late night stroll around Piccadilly Circus, which she documented via Instagram.

Slipping into something more comfortable, Nicole donned a printed tracksuit with a black fitted cap and white slippers.

The caption which accompanied the images read: 'Late night walking Roscoe on the streets of #London after a great show tonight w/my girls @natalieromerolv @diddi_e #hotelslippers'.

Ahead of her night out Nicole was seen returning to her hotel with her tan-and-white English bulldog after jetting in from a weekend trip to Los Angeles.

Framing her face with a pair of sunglasses, Nicole, 36, looked ready for the gym, wearing a loose-fitting white top, black leggings and black-and-white trainers.  

The singer took to her Instagram account to share a snapshot of Roscoe nuzzling her next to the caption: 'Me & Roscoe so proud of you babe @lewishamilton winning #f1 #SingaporeGP #1 XO' 

In a follow-up shot hours later, Roscoe was also the star of the show when Nicole went to rehearse with her dancers. 

'Rehearsing for my private gig in #London tonight w/our mascot #TeamRoscoe,' she wrote.

Hamilton, 29, bought Roscoe in February 2013, saying that he had dreamed of owning an English bulldog ever since he was a child.
