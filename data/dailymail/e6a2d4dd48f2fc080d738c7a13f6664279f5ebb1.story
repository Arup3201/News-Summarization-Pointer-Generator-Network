'Then teachers were running, then firefighters.'

Freshman Tessa Hoover, who was in the classroom next door, added: 'We didn't know what was happening.

'Our teacher ran out of our class, then into the room next door. Then she started screaming.

'Right away we knew something really horrible had happened.'

She told the Register her digital media arts teacher returned and locked the door before they were ushered into the gym a few minutes later.

Shocking find: Jacobson was found inside a classroom at El Dorado High School in Placentia, California 

Students and co-workers remembered the teacher's upbeat smile and thanked her for inspiring them

Crisis counselors have been made available on campus for the most traumatised students. 

Captain Steve Concialdi, of the Orange County Fire Authority, says the teacher took her life sometime before 8.40am yesterday.

According to the police official, students who found the victim initially arrived to a locked classroom. 

After the two students were let inside by another teacher, the three found the teacher and helped cut her down from the ceiling.

Responding paramedics found her lying on the classroom floor suffering from cardiac arrest, and performed CPR but were unable to revive the teacher. She was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Assistant Superintendent Kevin Lee with Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District said classes were dismissed for the day at 11am.

A force for good: Jacobson's (left) father reportedly had killed himself, and she always urged teens not to resort to suicide

He also confirmed there there was an 'emergency medical situation' involving a teacher.

Online records show that Jacobson was married and lived with her 34-year-old husband in Anaheim. He has been notified.  

Several students told the OC Register that Jacobson's father killed himself, and she that she always urged teens in distress not to resort to suicide.

There is no word at this time on what may have prompted the popular teacher to end her life. 

Police said no note was found at the scene, but Lt Eric Point said the preliminary investigation indicated suicide.
