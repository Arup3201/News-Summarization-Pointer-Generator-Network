Mother Helen Turnbull, 35, kissed a 16-year-old pupil before telling him it was her 'guilty pleasure' and 'clearly teaching had its perks', a court heard

A teaching assistant who kissed a 16-year-old pupil told him it was her 'guilty pleasure' before exclaiming 'clearly teaching does have its perks', a court heard.

Helen Turnbull, 35, denies having sex with the boy but has admitted kissing him during secret meetings in her Mini convertible and sending him flirtatious messages.

The mother of two, from Haswell, County Durham, has admitted one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, relating to kissing, but denies three further counts relating to sex, a sex act and oral sex.

In the witness box at Teesside Crown Court today, Turnbull denied being unfaithful to her ex-husband Ben and said that she never had sex with the boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

Sarah Mallett, prosecuting, read out some of the messages the pair sent each other over the internet after they first kissed on an industrial estate.

He wrote to her: 'You love kissing me' before she replied: 'It's a guilty pleasure.'

She later added: 'Clearly teaching does have its perks.'

When Miss Mallett asked if teaching had the 'advantage' of giving her contact with people to kiss, Turnbull replied: 'That was a stupid thing to say and I fully admit it. 

'Earlier in the messages I say why am I even doing it. I was confused.

'Guilty pleasure - we did kiss and I did feel guilty about it.'

Earlier, Miss Mallett read out a message Turnbull sent to the boy when they were discussing two men who may have seen them kissing.

It said: 'They were thinking "them two are well horny but she's out of his league".'

The court also heard how Turnbull allegedly asked the boy which knickers she should wear for a secret meeting with him – by texting him beforehand with the choice of 'pink or yellow'.

When he replied 'pink', she wrote back: 'Haha, got them on.'

On another occasion they discussed where they should have sex and he suggested her desk. 

Turnbull (pictured outside court) also sent a text message to the boy asking which colour knickers she should wear: 'pink or yellow', the court heard. She also said he would be a legend if they had sex on her desk

Miss Mallett said: 'You say he would be a legend.

'You say "gutted if we get caught" because you would get sacked.'

They also discussed staying at a hotel and undressing, the court heard.

The boy wrote to the literacy assistant: 'Your dress wouldn't be on for long, like' and she replied: 'To the floor in seconds.'

Of the messages, Turnbull told the prosecution: 'It was just chat, all talk, it didn't happen.'

Earlier in the trial, Turnbull admitted she enjoyed the attention she received from the pupil, who is now 18.

She told the court: ‘There was no intention ever to act on the messages but it was what he wanted.

‘I wish now I had not sent them. It was just sexual chat, being able to flirt with somebody. I enjoyed getting the attention, especially when I was on my own. The children were in bed – it was the instancy of getting a message back and not feeling on my own.

‘The next day I would say it wasn’t right and try to end it.’

The court also previously heard how her marriage broke down when her affair with the teenager came to light.

Her husband said he became suspicious after seeing a comment beside a Facebook picture of Turnball and the boy in which she asked him whether she should wear an ‘itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini’ on a school outing.

Turnbull denies three charges of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust, but has admitted a fourth, relating to kissing.

The trial continues.
