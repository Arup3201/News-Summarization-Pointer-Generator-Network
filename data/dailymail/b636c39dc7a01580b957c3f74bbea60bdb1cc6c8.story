Leaked emails have added further weight to claims three Norfolk schools knew about visits by Ofsted inspectors days, and even weeks in advance. 

The academies involved - Ormiston Victory Academy in Norwich, Thetford Academy and Great Yarmouth Primary - are all linked to Dame Rachel De Souza. 

Ms De Souza was principal at the Norwich school and is the chief executive of the Inspiration Trust which runs the academies in Thetford and Great Yarmouth. 

Leaked emails have added further weight to claims three Norfolk schools knew about visits by Ofsted inspectors days, and even weeks in advance - the schools were linked to Dame Rachel De Souza

By law, schools can only be given half a day's notice of an inspection, but in August it was claimed the schools knew days, sometimes even weeks, before inspectors were due to visit. 

At the time Ms De Souza had moved from being the headteacher at Ormiston Victory school to the trust. She had also been made a dame for services to education and was a part-time Ofsted inspector. 

Sir Robert Bosher, national director for quality and inspection training at Ofsted, looked into the tip-off claims and concluded the schools could merely have guessed the dates of inspections. 

But leaked emails seen by The Observer show Ms De Souza saw an inspection schedule for one of the schools and was in a position to discuss the timing of visits with Ofsted. 

In a group email sent more than three weeks before inspectors visited Ormiston Victory Academy on May 14 and 15, 2013, Ms De Souza wrote: 'Only three weeks or so till Ofsted due at Victory too! Let's keep focused.' 

Ms De Souza was principal of the Ormiston Victory Academy and is believed to have found out in advance about an inspection there by Ofsted, and requested for the school website and honour role to be updated

The Tetford Academy was also caught up in the tip-up claims investigated by Ofsted

According to the emails, Ms De Souza appears to have acted on prior knowledge in the days before a visit to Ormiston Victory. She had requested that the school's website be updated - 'inspectors will probably look Monday', and that their roll of honour be 'sorted' as it looked 'sparse on the wall'.

At Great Yarmouth Primary Academy, where Ms De Souza was chair of governors, Mr Bosher's investigation conceded she was 'mistakenly given sight of a schedule' that included the planned inspection date for the school. The information was provided to her during her training to become a Ofsted inspector. 

Mr Bosher said there was no evidence that Ms De Souza had passed the information on.

The inspection date was then changed, from May 7 and 8 to May 13 and 14, but the school's principal, Bill Holledge, however, turned down an offer from David Cameron to attend a Downing Street function on May 12.

According to the emails, three weeks before those inspections Ms De Souza informed her secretary: '14 and 15th May – please do not add any further appointments – I am expecting a late notice very important event on or around those days.' 

MailOnline was unable to reach Ms De Souza for comment.
