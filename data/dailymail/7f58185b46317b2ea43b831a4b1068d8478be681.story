She’s known for her perfect figure and dazzled viewers with her foxtrot in the tenth series of Strictly Come Dancing. 

But Denise Van Outen has revealed she's never followed a fad diet and doesn’t deliberately cut out any foods entirely.

In fact, she claims she ‘not a big one for getting on the scales’ and ‘couldn’t tell you’ what she weighs today, she told MailOnline.

Instead of bathroom scales, she has a favourite pair of skinny jeans. 

They work as her weight-gauge: if she can’t fit into them, she knows she has to hit the gym.

Denise Van Outen says she keeps slim by being 'sensible': she doesn't do fat diets but avoids carbs in the afternoon and runs on a treadmill while watching TV

While she was crowned 'Rear of the Year' in 1999, she says she likes to keep her legs in shape so she can wear her favourite skinny jeans and pencil skirts

Her mantra over the last ten years has been to eat and exercise ‘sensibly’, and she says she has to keep fit as her job as a West End actress demands it.

‘Especially the industry I work in, if you look good and you’re healthy, you feel good,’ she said.

‘If I gain weight, I feel sluggish. You’re not jumping out of bed, ready to tackle the day.’

Though she was crowned Rear of the Year in 1999, her legs are the main focus of her exercise.

‘I try and keep my legs in good shape. I like to wear my skinny jeans and pencil skirts,’ she says.

And harking back to her earlier days as an Essex ladette, she admits she still drinks too much on holiday and can’t resist crisps.

‘I don’t have a sweet tooth, I’m lucky. So I don’t have to worry about cakes and biscuits,’ she told MailOnline.

‘I like crisps - I could devour a whole bag of them watching my favourite TV shows.’

She says she gained around two stone after having her daughter, and often puts on weight over Christmas or after a holiday – but finds it easy to cut down afterwards.

'My daughter Betsy is my motivation for everything,' Ms Van Outen says. Though she lives her life in the public eye, her daughter  allows her to stay mentally strong. 'I'm a mother first before anything else,' she adds

‘It’s from drinking wine, if you’ve been on holiday.

‘I just cut out the booze to lose weight.’

Her other top tip? Avoiding carbs late at night.

‘I love jacket potatoes. But I have them for lunch so I can burn them off in the afternoon,’ she says.

Despite being 40, she says she feels much younger, and isn’t scared by the thought of ageing.

‘I always think “You never feel any older”. The way I behave, it’s like I’m in my early 20s. 

'Having a daughter keeps me young. I’ve got an excuse to be young and silly.’

‘I don’t know how I’ll feel when I’m 50, you’ll have to ask me then.’

A fifth of Britons would give up chocolate or Facebook for a year in order to lose a stone, a survey has found.

People said they would consider giving up alcohol forever (19 per cent), stop watching their favourite soap (15 per cent) and some even said they would give up sex for a year (11 per cent) in order to lose weight.

The research was commissioned by XLS Medical, which manufactures weight loss supplements.

The survey found that collectively, British people want to lose a total of 67.2m stone this year, and almost a third are looking to lose up to two stone.

But the research revealed that by January 31, more than half of New Year diets (56 per cent) will be dead. 

A fifth of Britons would delete their Facebook account in order to lose a stone, according to a survey

It highlighted the plethora of excuses we make to allow ourselves to resume unhealthy eating.

Top excuses were: 'it's too cold to exercise' (17 per cent) and 'you don’t see the results quickly enough' (21 per cent).

XLS Medical iS now searching for people to take part in a new weight loss documentary series, fronted by Denise Van Outen.

They will be guided through a slimming programme, with the highs and lows of their weight loss journey charted on camera.

As well as taking part in the BBC show Strictly Come Dancing, she is the voice of reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex, whose stars are famous for their fake tans and plastic surgery.

While she’s currently not considering going under the knife, it’s not a move she’s written off.

‘I wouldn’t rule it out one day,’ she said. ‘If anything’s going to make you feel it better, then do it.

‘Some people lose weight, some people change their hair.

‘What I would say is the cast of TOWIE are young. It is an addiction for some people.’

For now, she sticks to a good diet and exercise to keep middle age spread and wrinkles at bay.

She has both a treadmill and an exercise bike in her home - which she likes to use in front of the TV - and says signing up for charity events keeps her motivated.

‘I’ve cycled through Rajasthan, climbed the Great Wall of China and I’m just about to cycle across Vietnam and Cambodia’ she says.

If she gains weight by drinking too much on holiday or eating too much over Christmas, Ms Van Outen just puts on a pair of unforgiving skinny jeans. If they are too tight, she knows she needs to hit the gym. She is pictured out and about in London (left) and appearing on BBC show Strictly Come Dancing (right)

‘That gives me the motivation to exercise and keep going because I’ve got a target.’

She enjoys being part of a team and hearing other people’s stories.

On her last trip, one lady was beating cancer, which struck a chord with her as she lost her grandmother to the disease.

She became an ambassador for charity Breast Cancer UK afterwards, carries out breast examinations and  always gets regular check ups herself.

This is one of the reasons she wants to inspire healthy living and weight loss in others.

But she says other people can lose weight and stick to an exercise regime even if they don’t sign up to such ‘extreme’ events as the ones she’s taken part in.

Ms Van Outen is pictured celebrating her 40th birthday in May this year. But she told MailOnline she is not scared by the thought of ageing

She says: ‘I’m not a weight loss expert.

'I can speak for me and my friends. One of my friends signed up for a 10km walk and it really motivated her.

‘I’ve got friends who have signed up for stuff and it changes their outlook.’

This is why she has paired up with XLS Medical, a food supplement that claims to aid weight loss.

The company creates tablets and sachets which are eaten  after meals, poured straight into the mouth without any water.

It's claimed the products stop the digestion of fat and carbohydrates.

Clinical studies published in the journal Obesity found that people using XLS Medical's Fat Binder product or Carb Blocker product lost three times as much weight after 12 weeks as those taking  placebo tablets.

Ms Van Outen is now searching for women to take part in a weight loss documentary. 

They will go through a slimming programme, with the highs and lows of their journey recorded on camera.

She told MailOnline: ‘I got involved because I believe in successful weight loss.

‘It will be great to see how these women have changed their lives and go on a journey with them, hearing their stories.

‘You don’t have to do the whole course. I even signed my mum up to take the tablets. 

'She had to get Christmas out of the way, but she loves it now.’

And beneath the glamour and fame of the life of a superstar, she says it is her family that is most important to her; and allows her to stay mentally strong in what can be a superficial industry.

‘My daughter is the motivation for everything,’ she said.

‘When I go home and I come and close the door. The rest is just my job, it doesn’t matter.

‘When I close the door, I’m a mother first, and that’s what matters.’
