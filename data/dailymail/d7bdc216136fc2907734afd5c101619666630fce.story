A girl of 16 died after taking a mystery drug at a house party.

Poppy Rodgers was found critically ill at a terraced house on a rundown housing estate during the early hours last Friday.

She was taken to hospital but later died. The trainee beauty therapist is understood to have taken a yellowy-white powder, believed to be an amphetamine paste.

Her death prompted police to issue an urgent warning about the concoction as they conducted further tests to determine what exactly she took.

Last night, her devastated family were being comforted by family liaison officers.

Poppy Rogers died after taking the substance while at a house in York

A friend of the family said: ‘This is a very difficult time for all of them. It’s totally unexpected.

‘The family are all understandably devastated and this is very raw. Poppy was a loving, happy, well-liked young girl. But she was naive and stubborn.

‘I don’t know whether she got into the wrong crowd or what happened, we don’t know much at the moment. I don’t know whether she was friends with the people at the house or how she got to be there.

‘She wasn’t a little tearaway, she was a lovely young girl who was naive.’

The friend added: ‘This is a lesson for young people not to experiment with drugs.’

Her mother, Ann-Margaret Rodgers, is believed to have began a relationship with local artist Andy Hinkles, 45, after separating from Poppy's father

On a social networking site Poppy’s 
mother writes: ‘I’m the proud Mummy of a beautiful daughter, without her
in my life the sun would never shine.’

She lives less than a mile from the 
house where Poppy collapsed in the Tang Hall area of York. It is not yet
known if Poppy, a student at York College, went to the house party on 
her own or with friends.

Neighbours said the house was known for attracting trouble. The front window was boarded up last week after a sofa was hurled through it.

Tributes: Twitter users have been taking to the internet site to pay tribute to 16-year-old Poppy Rodgers

On the evening Poppy died they said they heard loud music and fireworks being let off in the back garden of the property at about 10pm. Then, just after midnight, they heard the siren of an ambulance.

Simon Moss, who lives opposite the house and is the chairman of the Tang Hall residents’ association, also reported hearing ‘a lot of police activity’.

He said: There are always sirens going off here. It seems there is some kind of trouble more often than not. The fact that it is connected to drugs does not surprise me.’

Poppy formerly studied at Norton College and at King James’s School, in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire.

A man of 21 who was taken to York Hospital, pictured, with Miss Rodgers has since been discharged

The school’s head Carl Sugden said: ‘We are all desperately saddened by this news.

‘Poppy was a well-regarded girl and was popular and had a good group of friends.’

A man of 21 who was taken to hospital with Miss Rodgers has since been discharged.

A man of 23 and a 26-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug. Both have now been released on bail.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: ‘People are strongly urged not to risk taking substances matching this description. One girl has already died, so the potential dangers are very real.’
