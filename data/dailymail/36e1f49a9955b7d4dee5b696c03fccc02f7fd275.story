A pregnant bride-to-be has confirmed her plans to marry a convicted killer in a Peruvian jail who is wanted in the U.S. over the disappearance of another woman.

Leidy Figueroa is planning to wed Dutchman Joran van der Sloot, who is currently serving 28 years in jail for the murder of local college student Stephany Flores in 2010.

He is also wanted in the U.S. in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, 18, from Alabama, who went missing on a school trip in Aruba in 2005. When his prison time in Peru is complete he faces being extradited to America.

Leidy Figueroa, pictured, is planning to tie the knot with Dutch killer Joran van der Sloot, who is currently serving 28 years in jail for the murder of local college student Stephany Flores in 2010

Miss Figueroa, from Lima, is five months pregnant with van der Sloot’s child and visits the jail twice a week bringing him home cooked meals.

The pair plan to marry on May 22, having met in July 2010 when she went in to the same prison to visit a separate inmate who is said to have acted as a matchmaker.

In an interview with Crimesider, Miss Figueroa, 24, said her husband-to-be had transformed himself ‘into a new person’ enjoying prison arts and crafts sessions.

The Dutchman is also studying international business management using a correspondence scheme with a Peruvian learning establishment, according to CBS News. 

Joran van der Sloot is currently serving 28 years in a Peruvian prison for the murder of local college student Stephany Flores, left, in 2010 but is also wanted in the U.S. in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, right, from Alabama, who went missing on a school trip in Aruba in 2005

His lawyer is said to have bought a ring with a small stone under van der Sloot’s instructions while the bride is currently looking for a wedding dress for the big day and wants permission to have camera crews and photographers present.

According to CBS News there have been reports that although there will be no reception, van der Sloot has two close friends in the Peidras Gordas jail – two soccer hooligans called ‘Crazy Dave’ Sanchez and ‘El Cholo’ Payet, both serving 35-years for homicide during a soccer match three years ago.

Conjugal visits are allowed in Peruvian prisons if a couple are registered as common-law partners. Now it appears the couple are set to officially tie the knot in the next couple of days.

Marrying a Peruvian could prove rather convenient for Van der Sloot as it would probably save him from extradition to the U.S. where he faces 25 years for extortion.

The 
Dutchman's extradition to the U.S. was approved last year in principle 
by Peru's Supreme Court, but only after he serves out his sentence in 
Lima. He could serve less than ten years in Peruvian prison for good 
behavior.

Van der Sloot is reportedly taking part in prison arts and crafts sessions and is also studying international business management using a correspondence scheme with a Peruvian learning establishment

Now,
 by marrying a local Peruvian, he can automatically apply for Peruvian 
citizenship, which will hinder America’s chances of ever extraditing 
him.

In
 2010, he was charged with attempting to extort $250,000 from Natalee 
Holloway’s mom in return for details about her daughter’s death.

Van der Sloot took a $25,000 down payment and then traveled to Peru on May 14, 2010, a trip that ended with the murder of Miss Flores, whom he met in a Lima casino, on May 25.

The date is a chilling one to the Holloway family, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen.

Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot walks inside the courtroom during the reading of his verdict, in the Lurigancho prison in Lima, Peru on January 13, 2012. He was was sentenced to 28 years in prison for killing Stephany Flores in Lima in 2010

He took 
cash and credit cards from Miss Flores before fleeing to Chile, where he
 was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

He
 confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after
 she found out about his suspected involvement in the Natalee Holloway 
case.

Miss 
Holloway's body has never been found and repeated searches in Aruba turned up 
nothing as intense media coverage brought the case worldwide attention.

Together
 with a Dutch investigative journalist, Beth Holloway spoke to Van der 
Sloot in a Peruvian jail where admit to extortion, but not to the truth 
about what happened to her daughter.

Natalee Holloway was 17 when she disappeared on Aruba, the Dutch island in the southern Caribbean Sea, during a school trip.

Van der Sloot admitted to killing Flores, but blamed post traumatic stress disorder for being accused of Holloway’s disappearance for making him kill the Peruvian.

In prison letters released last July, Van der Sloot said hoped the Flores family could forgive him for his crimes.

'I ask God every day that Stephany's parents can find it in their heart to forgive me,' he wrote.But he also made an attempt to paint himself as the victim.

He said he believed he was misled by his attorney when he pleaded guilty to Flores’ murder and that he suffers from ‘psychological’ problems that should have been weighed in the murder case.Mr Van der Sloot wrote: 'My rights have been constantly abused.

My lawyer promised me I would receive 15 years if I plead guilty, I did.'

He also referred to himself as a psychological 'mess' in the letters, which were written in English and contain numerous misspellings and grammatical errors.

'I have a history of psychological problems which were never taken into consideration,' he said.
