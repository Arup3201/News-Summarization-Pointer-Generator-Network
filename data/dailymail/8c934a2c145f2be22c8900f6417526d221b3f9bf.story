Arsenal vs Manchester United should be postponed due to injuries

Jack Wilshere's critics need to pipe down... he can become world class

I had a conversation with former Scotland striker Andy Gray after an England defeat about 10 years ago which went something like this:

AG – that was awful

AD – it was, but as a Scotsman you can hardly talk

AG – At least we know we’re no good!

It was right at the time but now the tables are totally turned.

England fans have no doubt whatsoever where the national team is at. They generally do well in qualifiers, but fail badly at tournaments.

No England fan I know thought we would do anything at the World Cup in Brazil and so it proved. I doubt that pessimism will be different come the European Championships in France.

What about Scotland?

Full of bravado when they play England, some Scots even pretended last year’s defeat at Wembley was some sort of moral victory. They even claimed the same about the defeat in Germany recently. In fact a few decent performances and a couple of results – a draw in Poland and a win over Ireland – have somehow become the stuff of legend with Gordon Strachan the new kilted Braveheart Messiah.

Credit where it is due, the winner on Friday night was a fantastic goal, and there is definitely improvement which the Scottish fans have every right to enjoy.

But Andy Gray’s accusation that the English were deluded all those years ago now applies to Scotland. If they beat England’s B team and then thrash Gibraltar, the delusion will reach epic proportions.

But here’s the reality of their qualifying group: Poland beat Germany, and they lead the group; Germany should win the group, Ireland have four of their next five qualifiers at home – the only away trip in that time is to Gibraltar; the Scots have trips to Georgia and Ireland, then home games with Poland and Germany. Sure they could win them all, but any Scots thinking qualification for the Euros is going to be easy is totally deluded.

And there’s delusion about the Scottish identity. On Friday night Ireland’s Aiden McGeady was booed because he chose the Irish despite being born in Falkirk. Yet it’s not a problem – and it shouldn’t be – for the Scots to field the likes of Russell Martin, Steven Fletcher and Chris Martin, all born in England. Is that blatant hypocrisy? If it isn’t then do Scotland have an identity crisis?

I’m looking forward to Scotland against England but sadly it stopped being about football long ago. It has now become a game where Scotland raise their game despite it only being a friendly. And worse than that it has become a fixture about drink, hate, war and trouble.

The last time I was in Glasgow for a Scotland v England game a Scottish fan jumped on a table in a pub and brandished a massive sword, waving it around above his head. Unsurprisingly, the pub cleared quicker than Hampden Park did after Paul Scholes double dumped on the Scots.

What has that got to do with football?

There were so many drunks (from both countries) slumped around Hampden and the city centre after the game I wondered how much football they’d witnessed through their blurred double vision.

If England and Scotland are drawn together in qualification, or at a tournament, then let’s get the game on. But failing that, I’m not bothered.

And I know I’m not the only one who isn’t particularly excited about this fixture.
