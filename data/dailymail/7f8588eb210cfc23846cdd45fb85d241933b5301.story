Bobbies off the beat: New South Yorkshire chief constable David Crompton, pictured, wants to take warranted officers off the streets

Plans to replace beat policemen with community support officers were heavily criticised yesterday...by the man who created the so-called plastic PCs in the first place.

Fully-trained officers would be taken off the streets and put into fast response teams.

Community support officers – also nicknamed ‘Blunkett’s Bobbies’ after former home secretary David Blunkett under whose watch they were established – lack the arrest powers available to warranted officers. They are also cheaper and have less training.

But even Mr Blunkett, who is an MP in Sheffield, condemned the plans, saying PCSOs were intended to help police but not replace them.

He said: ‘Warranted officers will always be required to conduct arrests, develop good scientific forensic investigations and build the kind of community policing which engages those living there.’

The proposals are for South Yorkshire Police but there are fears the idea could be adopted by other forces.

The senior officer behind them was forced to deny it would lead to officers sitting in police stations. Chief Constable David Crompton said: ‘They will still be working in the same areas.

‘If somebody needs a police officer, they will get one, in the same way they always have.’

'We’re determined to use both police officers and PCSOs as efficiently as we possibly can. What we want to do is make sure that we send them to the right jobs,' he said.

Better off: The force say that removing officers, right, from the streets, and replacing them with PCSOs, left, will cut crime in their area

'Some 80 per cent of the things we 
deal with are not related to crime at all. Of the remaining 20 per cent,
only a small number turn out to be confrontational situations. PCSOs 
are asked to deal with a huge range of things already – what we’re 
looking at is if there’s anything else we can do to maximise what we get
out of them.'

In an interview this morning David Crompton said the issue was a 'storm in a tea cup'.

Opposed: Former Home Secretary David Blunkett helped bring in PCSOs but says they are not a replacement for beat bobbies

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today 
programme the policy had been in place for some time but 'grabbed the 
headlines' based on an update report to the local police authority.

Mr Crompton said: 'Any suggestion we are taking officers away from areas they have been working in the past is plain wrong.

'We have had PCSOs in the police service for 10 years, we have some fantastic, dedicated and talented people.

'They are capable of dealing with 95% 
of the community type issues which come up. But there are also generally
things, particularly around more confrontational situations, you would 
genuinely want a police office for.

'When those occasions arise people will have a police officer to deal with that.'

Former Home Secretary David Blunkett 
has raised concerns about the proposals saying it is a mistake, despite 
being the man who brought in PCSOs, then dubbed 'Blunkett's Bobbies'.

A spokesman for the South Yorkshire 
Police Federation, which represents rank and file police, said: ‘What we
don’t want is for officers to only turn up when someone needs arresting
or dealing with.

‘We don’t want to be seen to be the bad guys.

1960s: Z-Cars stars Colin Welland, James Lynch, Stratford Johns and Brian Blessed, and the move by South Yorkshire police has been described as a return to this style of policing

‘We’ve spent years and years with communities building up a relationship with the police.’

Opposition leader Ed Miliband said he did not back the proposals.

Speaking in Wath upon Dearne in South 
Yorkshire, the Labour leader said: 'We need PCSOs but we need them 
supporting and working with police officers on the frontline. I think 
that's the kind of neighbourhood policing that people want to see.

'I don't think they want police 
officers out of the way, just in their patrol cars, just dealing with 
other issues and away from the beat.

'I think you need on the beat police officers and PCSOs.'
