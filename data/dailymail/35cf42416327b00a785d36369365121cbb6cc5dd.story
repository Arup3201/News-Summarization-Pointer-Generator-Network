Graphic details: Briana Holland, 22, has admitted to giving birth at work then dumping the newborn boy gagged with a tampon applicator and bound with toilet paper in a garbage can, expecting him to die

An Indianapolis woman has admitted to giving birth in a restroom then dumping the newborn boy gagged and bound with toilet paper in a garbage can, expecting him to die.

A judge entered a preliminary not guilty plea Wednesday for 22-year-old Briana Holland on charges including attempted murder and child neglect.

Police arrested Holland after her co-workers at an Indianapolis warehouse found the newborn Friday night.

Court documents say the baby's head was covered in a bag, part of a tampon applicator was shoved inside his mouth and toilet paper was wrapped 15 times around his neck.

A police affidavit cited by Fox59 says Holland stated she was scared and could not afford to care for her son while attending college and holding down a job.

The affidavit said when the detective asked Holland what she thought would happen to the baby she replied: ‘I know what the results would probably be. It would probably die.’

The baby, who is in the custody of child welfare officials, was purple, cold and gasping for air when the co-workers found in the trash can, court documents said.

A maintenance worker at the industrial facility has been credited with saving the child's life.

The station WANE reported that the 
unnamed employee was alerted by a colleague to strange sounds coming 
from a trash bin in a restroom.

Heroic actions: The authorities were notified after staffer at United Technology Carrier Corporation raised the alarm; one of the workers used a shirt to keep the infant warm and stopped the bleeding from the umbilical cord with his hands

Upon discovering the source of the noise, the worker wrapped the baby's cold body in a shirt to keep him warm and stopped the bleeding from the umbilical cord with his bare hands.

Doctors at Riley Hospital said the newborn could have bled to death or succumbed to hypothermia if it wasn't for the Good Samaritan’s efforts.

Holland's boyfriend told police that she had kept her pregnancy secret from her family and hadn't received any prenatal care.

He said he found out about her giving birth on Twitter and intends to seek custody of the child, the affidavit said.

After being contacted by employees at 
United Technology Carrier Corporation last Friday, police arrived to 
find the newborn inside the company's bathroom trash can.

Police recovered the baby at around 8pm that evening - thought to be only an hour after he was born. 

Holland
 reportedly went right back to her work station after delivering her son 
in the bathroom. She was arrested by detectives at 5am the following 
morning and taken away for processing.

The 22-year-old's twin sister and father also work at the warehouse, but she did not got to them for help when she went into labor. Holland also did not seek assistance from a medical station located at the site.

Unexpected find: Police at the United Technology Carrier Corporation facility on Friday evening where the boy was found with toilet paper wrapped 15 times around his neck

Although the yet-to-be-named newborn weighing 7.9lbs and measuring 20.1 inches in length was taken to Riley Hospital for Children in a critical condition, his health has since improved and he is in the care of Department of Child Services staff.

Indiana has
 a safe haven law that allows people to give up custody of infants less 
than 30 days old to a hospital emergency room, police or fire station. A
 fire station is located across the street from the warehouse where 
Holland worked.

Since
 the safe haven law was enacted in 2000, nearly 140 infants have been 
left with emergency services providers, according to the Indiana 
Department of Child Services.
