Howard is accused of throwing the defenseless girl in the air and then kicking her in the head with his steel-toed boots.

He's then accused of throwing her face-down in a corner of a couch where he left her for about 30 minutes before checking on her.

NewsOk reports that Howard called 911 at 8:40 p.m. to tell police that the injured child was unresponsive.

She was taken to the hospital with multiple injuries such as a head injury and blood in her stomach.

Howard allegedly told officers different stories about how the child became injured and his stories did not match up with the damage.

Howard told police he tried to revive the young girl by pouring water down her throat.

Howard is being held without bail in the child’s death and is being represented by court-appointed attorneys Tyson Stanek and Taos Smith.

District Judge Tracy Schumacher is presiding over the grim case.
