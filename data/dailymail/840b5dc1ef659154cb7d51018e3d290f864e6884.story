Slain: Dan 'Selina' Lin was killed by her mother-in-law Huajiao Zhuang who bashed her 33 times with a hammer. Zhuang was found guilty of the murder on Thursday in the Victorian Supreme Court

A Melbourne grandmother has been found guilty of bashing her daughter-in-law to death with a hammer – so her son could marry someone else.

The Victorian Supreme Court heard how Huajiao Zhuang, 50, travelled to her daughter-in-law Dan 'Selina' Lin’s Bundoora home on the afternoon of 3 May 2012 and beat her an astonishing 33 times with a hammer.

Ms Lin's death was the culmination of a long-running feud with her mother-in-law, who claimed the 21-year-old didn't pay her enough respect.

It is understood Zhuang felt she did not have enough contact with or influence on her son and expected to live under the same roof, which Lin did not allow.

After the killing she wrapped Ms Lin's body in a nylon bag, put it in a wheelie bin and returned to dump the body in the Darebin creek later that night, court heard.

Zhuang’s lawyers argued that their client had acted in self-defence and that the victim Lin was the person who first wielded the hammer.

Defence barrister Shane Gardner earlier told the trial 'You can hear the sincerity in her voice ... you can hear she's genuine, you can hear the anguish in her when she gives those answers (in a police interview),' The Age reported.

However the Victorian Supreme Court jury found her guilty of murdering the 21-year-old on Thursday, delivering their verdict as Zhuang sobbed and wailed.

During the trial, the court heard the pair were locked in a continuing feud over the respect Ms Lin paid to her mother-in-law.

Guilty: Huajiao Zhuang, 50, had to be physically assisted from court after the jury handed down their verdict

Prosecutor Peter Kidd said Zhuang wanted her son Peter to divorce Ms Lin and marry a woman from China so he could earn ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars’ from the woman's family, thanks to his permanent Australian residency.

A school friend of Ms Lin once heard Zhuang ask her grandson ‘how would you like to change your mother?,’ Kidd told court.

Zhuang had earlier told police the fatal fight broke out after a dispute over her grandson's bath water, something rubbished by the prosecutor.

The killer wailed loudly after the verdict was delivered, and had to be physically assisted as she left the courtroom.

According to The Age, forensic evidence suggested Ms Lin remained conscious for some time after her mother-in-law began the repeated hammer attack.

She was found to have died of repeated blunt force trauma to the head.

Justice Stephen Kaye will hear sentencing submissions next Thursday.
