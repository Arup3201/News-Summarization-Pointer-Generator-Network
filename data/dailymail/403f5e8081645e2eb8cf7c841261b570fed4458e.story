Spanish football may have a new home on TV from next season.

Sky have held the rights to screen La Liga matches for nearly 20 years but their contract is up at the end of the season and rivals BT Sport will be keen to buy the rights from 2015. 

Sky lost the rights to show Champions League football last season when their contract expired and BT stepped in and paid £897million for three years exclusive coverage.

BT Sport have already secured the rights to show Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A, France's Ligue 1 and Portugal's Primeira Liga. 

Sky recently launched a channel - Sky Sports 5 - dedicated to showing European football and will be keen to hold onto the rights for Spanish football.

The TV rivals are gearing up for the start of the new Premier League season on Saturday. BT are showing Louis van Gaal's first competitive game as Manchester United a boos - a home fixture against Swansea.

Sky meanwhile are showing Arsenal v Crystal Palace on Saturday, Liverpool v Southampton and Newcastle v Manchester City on Sunday and Burnley v Chelsea on Monday.
