Saudi Arabia’s national airline is denying claims that it is planning to separate male and female passengers on its flights.

Gulf media reported last week that Saudia would introduce gender segregation for passengers unless they are close relatives, but the carrier has issued a statement saying the reports are incorrect.

In the statement, an unnamed official said: ‘We would like to emphasise that no Saudia official has made any statement on gender segregation.’

Saudia is denying reports that it plans to introduce separate cabins for male and female passengers 

Gulf media claimed Saudia planned to segregate cabins based on gender in response to complaints from male passengers who were upset that other men were seated next to their wives or other female family members.

There were also claims that male passengers had accused a female flight attendant of being too ‘flirty’.

In response to the complaints, Abdul Rahman Al-Fahad, Saudia’s vice-president of marketing, was quoted by Saudi daily Ajel as saying: ‘There are solutions to this problem … we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.’

In a series of tweets he said the report was false and a ‘fabrication’. 

There are no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served on board. 

A prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take-off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area. 

The airline does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead.

Abdul Rahman Al-Fahad, Saudia’s vice-president of marketing, said the report in question is incorrect

The state-run airline said the quote was from a tweet sent to one of his followers about seating arrangements for families who want to sit together - a source of delays - and was taken out of context.

Ajel reported that Saudia’s ‘solutions’ would be gender segregation for men and women who are not close relatives. 

The airline said: ‘It is worth mentioning that the airline’s website allow families to select nearby seats for their members while booking.

‘Some passengers may not get this facility if they did not select seats or made late reservations.’

Abdul Rahman Al-Fahad said his response about family seating arrangements was taken out of context

Saudia says its website allows families to choose seats while booking to avoid delays while boarding

The carrier's policies are already in tune to the strict Islamic practices of Saudi Arabia: no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served on board, a prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take-off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area.

In addition, Saudia does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead.

But moves are being made to employ females on the ground in November. The airline opened its fourth women's section staffed by entirely by females at its office in the Murooj district of the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

The country is known for its gender segregation, with women requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. In public spaces such as restaurants, beaches, amusement parks or banks, women are required to enter and exit through special doors.

Women who are seen socialising with a man who is not a relative can even be charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.
