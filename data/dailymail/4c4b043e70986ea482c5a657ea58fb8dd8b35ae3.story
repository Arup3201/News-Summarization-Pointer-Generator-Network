Daisy-Ray Anderson drowned in the bath when her father popped downstairs to get towels and her mother was out visiting a neighbour

A nine month-old girl drowned in the bath after her father went downstairs to get towels and nappies and her mother popped out to visit a neighbour, an inquest heard. 

Daisy-Ray Anderson was found face-down in the water by her father Dale, who left her briefly to fetch the supplies.

The baby was in the bath with her 18-month-old sister Lilly - just metres away from where 12 cannabis plants were growing, a coroner was told.

Daisy-Ray was put in the bath with her sister by their mother Emma Oliver, who left the bathroom after Mr Anderson entered the room to take over.

When the children were ready to get out, he called to Miss Oliver to bring up the nappies and towels, but she did not answer so he went to grab them himself.

Mr Anderson, a market trader, told the coroner: 'I came back up and that's when I saw Daisy. She was face-down in the water.

'I pulled her out and starting doing CPR on the floor. I was screaming and shouting for help.

'I got water and vomit out of her mouth but she wasn't breathing.'

Mr Anderson told the inquest that Daisy-Ray was in a baby bath towards the top of the main bath near to the taps, while her sister Lilly was in the main bath. 

Recalling the tragic day in September 2012, he said he went downstairs to find the front door of their home, in Moston, Greater Manchester, open.

'Emma wasn't there', he said. 'I slammed the door shut and got what I needed and went back upstairs.

'I didn't know Emma was going to leave the house. Then I heard the door go so I ran downstairs and opened the door.

'She looked at me and I was as white as a ghost. She just ran upstairs and picked Daisy up. She started screaming and panicking.'

Parents Emma Oliver and Dale Anderson were cleared of child cruelty charges after Daisy-Ray drowned in the bath in 2012

The inquest heard that paramedics took Daisy-Ray to North Manchester General Hospital where she was later pronounced dead.

Miss Oliver, a trainee plasterer, told the coroner she had put Daisy in the bath at around 10am because she had been sick.

She said: 'Lilly came up and said she wanted a bath too so I filled it up for her.

'I wasn't the one who played with the kids in the bath. I washed Daisy first and then got out the toys and then Dale came in.

'I nipped out for five minutes and went to see my neighbour. Lilly was 18 months old and we were talking about getting her name on the list for school.

'I didn't tell Dale I was going out and it was usual for him to play with the kids in the bath.

'I went over to my neighbour's still in my pyjamas so I went home to get dressed. I came back home and realised my door was shut.

'Dale came down and he was as white as a sheet. I just ran upstairs.'

Consultant paediatric pathologist Gauri Batra told Manchester Coroners' Court that a post-mortem on Daisy-Ray confirmed her cause of death was drowning. 

She said: 'This was a clean, well-nourished little girl and there was nothing congenitally wrong with her.' 

The couple, who are engaged, were charged with child cruelty after the tragic death but were later cleared by a jury. 

Paramedics took Daisy-Ray to hospital where she was pronounced dead after her father found her face-down in the water

They both admitted cannabis growing offences and Mr Anderson received a community order while she was conditionally discharged.

Jean Harkin, assistant coroner for Manchester City, recorded a verdict of accidental death.

She said: 'It's very clear that it's very dangerous to leave children for just one minute but no parent would have expected this to happen.

'All I can say to you is that you have to hold on to the memories that you have from when Daisy was alive.'
