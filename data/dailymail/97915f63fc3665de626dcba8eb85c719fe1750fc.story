A police force is under fire after it asked candidates to send in a 'selfie' before applying for the role of deputy chief constable.

Potential candidates have been asked to email a photograph of themselves to Humberside Police in order to request an application pack for the £117,000-a-year job.

But the force is now facing a backlash, with critics branding the request 'bizarre' and 'demeaning'. 

Some have warned that it could lead the legality of the process to be called into question, while others said that it could effect the opportunities of women and other minority groups.

'Bizarre': Potential candidates have been asked to email a photograph of themselves to Humberside Police in order to request an application pack for the £117,000-a-year role of deputy chief constable

The advertisement was posted on the Humberside Police website with the tagline 'new year, new you, new force'.

Before listing the job description and salary details, the advertisement asks applicants to 'send a photo along with your name and force' to an email address provided. 

The advertisement has been defended by Chief Constable Justine Curran who said it was 'vital candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology'.

But it was was criticised by Conservative MP Andrew Percy, representing Brigg & Goole and the Isle of Axhome, who called the request 'strange'.

He told MailOnline: 'This seems a very bizarre requirement and I cannot understand what possible benefit there can be to such an ask.

'I hope Humberside Police will reconsider this strange decision.' 

Hull councillor Phil Webster said it was 'demeaning and a bit discriminating', adding: 'It makes you wonder whether they want a new Robert Peel or a new Brad Pitt.'

John Hackston, a psychologist and head of R&D at OPP Limited, said that the photos have the potential to give away information such as an applicant's age, sex and race.

He explained that while there was no indication that Humberside Police intended to make any decisions based on this information, just having it available could potentially 'be dangerous'. 

Meanwhile the Women's Organisation, the largest developer and deliverer of training and support targeting women in the UK, warned that it could effect the opportunities of women and minority groups.

Maggie O'Carroll, the organisation's CEO, said: 'The person posting this advert has proven they are really out of kilter with equal opportunities practice and they need to get a grip. 

'Who issued this or approved it? – I’m happy to come up there and help them to get into the 21st century.'

While it is not illegal for an employer to ask potential applicants to send in a photo, legal complications could arise depending on how those photos are later used.  

Jessica Corsi, a partner at Doyle Clayton, the UK's largest specialist employment law firm, warned other employers not to follow the example of Humberside Police.

Ms Corsi pointed out that it could potentially raise issues regarding discrimination and data protection. 

She said: 'There is the chance that unsuccessful candidates might consider that they have been discriminated against if they are not shortlisted for interview based on the photo, for instance if they are from a minority ethnic group.

'Also, there is the question of what the police do with the 'selfies' afterwards. 

'Broadly speaking, under data protection laws they'd have to safely dispose of it once it was no longer necessary to them, but they are creating a compliance problem for themselves to ensure this is done correctly, especially where information is shared internally on emails.

'Apparently the police's request is because they are looking for IT-literate candidates. 

'I'd strongly recommend that employers put in place a more appropriate way of testing candidates for basic IT-literacy, such as a short test before a first interview'.

Jessica Cooper, Research Adviser at the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, acknowledged the request for 'selfies' could be relevant for roles where applicants need to be comfortable with social media and technologies. 

Backlash: The move was criticised by politicians who branded the post, pictured, 'demeaning' and 'bizarre'

She added: 'While legitimate questions should be asked about the wisdom of asking for 'selfies' in job applications, LinkedIn and Facebook – where photos are expected – are increasingly important parts of many organisations' recruitment processes, so the genie may well already be out of the bottle. 

But she warned that managers involved in recruiting should be given training to ensure 'that conscious and unconscious bias is not triggered by visual images of potential recruits.' 

Chief Constable Justine Curran defended the move saying it was 'vital candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology' as the force had invested heavily in new equipment to modernise the way they work.

She explained the force had 'invested heavily in new technology in a bid to modernise the way we work'.

Chief Const Curran said: 'We currently have a vacancy for a Deputy Chief Constable which is a key role within the force and as such it is vital that potential candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology within Humberside Police at the point of applying for the role.

'This is why we have created a recruitment advert that reflects our aims and ambitions as a force by encouraging candidates to get involved from the outset.'
