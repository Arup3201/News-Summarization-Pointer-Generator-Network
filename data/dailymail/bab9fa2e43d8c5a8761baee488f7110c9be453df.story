A Premier League star has been charged with drink driving after police pulled over his 160mph Porsche in the early hours of the morning.

Southampton FC striker Guly do Prado was arrested after officers spotted his black Porsche Panamera ‘driving erratically’ through the Hampshire city at 4.35am.

The 30-year-old Brazilian had been giving a lift to an attractive young brunette and two men on Monday morning.

Guly Do Prado of Southampton is tackled during the match between 
Southampton and Wigan Athletic at St Mary's Stadium on Saturday - two 
days before his arrest

Taxi drivers waiting outside a local 
nightspot watched in surprise as the 6ft 2ins star was beckoned from the
£70,000 coupe by traffic police.

Hours earlier the forward had been spotted cruising slowly past nightclubs in the trendy Bedford Place area of the city.

Guly,
whose recent performances have come in for criticism from Saints fans, 
played 76 minutes of the team’s home defeat to Wigan on Saturday before 
he was substituted.

A 
Southampton-based taxi driver who witnessed his arrest today said: 'I 
was parked at a taxi rank outside the lap dance club For Your Eyes Only.

'I
saw a flash, black Porsche come round the corner from the direction of 
Bedford Place, heading towards the Ocean Village area where Guly lives.

'He was then followed by an estate police patrol car with the blues and twos going.

'He had three passengers with him - a black guy, a white guy and a very attractive, slim girl with dark hair.

'The cops didn’t arrest him immediately as they seemed to be talking to him for about ten minutes and then a van pulled up too and they loaded him into the back of that.

'One of the officers also got into his car and drove it across the street and parked it in a parking space.

'I’m a Saints fan and this isn’t what you want to see from your top players.'

He added: 'I’d seen him earlier in the evening, about 10pm, driving around Bedford Place.

'He was on his own and had the windows open, playing music. I guess he wanted to be noticed.'

The star, who has scored 13 league goals for Southampton since joining from Italian club AC Cesena, can play up front or as an attacking midfielder.

He lives in Southampton’s luxury marina development, Ocean Village, as do a number of the club’s other players.

Hampshire Police released a statement saying: 'Police are able to confirm a 30-year-old Southampton man was arrested and subsequently charged for driving a motor vehicle while over the prescribed limit’.

'The arrest followed after police officers noticed a vehicle being driven erratically in the High Street, Southampton, at approximately 4.35am Monday, August 27.

'The man - 30 year-old Raymundo, Guilherme Do Prado - has been bailed to appear at Southampton Magistrates Court next month.'
