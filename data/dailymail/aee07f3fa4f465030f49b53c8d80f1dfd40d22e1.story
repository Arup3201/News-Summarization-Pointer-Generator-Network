Diego Costa doesn't look the same player in Europe as the one who reached the Champions League final with Atletico Madrid last season, according to former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.

The Blues were eliminated from the competition after a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night sent Paris Saint-Germain through to the quarter finals on away goals.

Costa cut a disconsolate figure throughout the game and, although he has taken the Premier League by storm this season, he has not scored in Europe's elite competition in all seven games this term.

Former Stamford Bridge favourite and now-Burton Albion manager Hasselbaink believes the 26-year-old has been afforded less space this term.

'Diego Costa needs space behind the defence, that's where he's at his best,' he told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show.

'The Champions League is another level to the Premier League though.

'Last year he had that space when playing for Atletico Madrid, but this campaign he hasn't looked as good in Europe as when he's playing in the Premier League.' 

The Brazil-born forward was involved in several spats during the game, including a row with former Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye after the final whistle, and was widely condemned by the French media with L'Equipe giving him a miserly 3/10 rating.
