Any sprinkling of stardust is guaranteed to light up Westminster. But when it involves Hollywood royalty some who should know better can get drunk on the excitement.

David Cameron and William Hague looked more like a pair of awestruck schoolboys than senior politicians as they met Angelina Jolie yesterday.

While they retain a statesman-like gravitas in the presence of presidents and monarchs, a Hollywood A-lister is definitely another matter. Particularly this one.

David Cameron met Angelina Jolie and  William Hague at Downing Street today - after the first day of the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence being chaired by the Hollywood star and the Foreign Secretary

Mr Hague brought Miss Jolie to Number 10 through the gates to Downing Street from the Foreign Office

Their faces lit up, their conversation was animated and they grinned broadly at every comment their star visitor made.

Miss Jolie was meeting the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in her role as a special envoy for the United Nations.

While
 she has a serious campaign to promote, she caused quite a stir as she 
visited Downing Street and the ExCel exhibition centre  in Docklands.

The
 39-year-old actress, who has six children with Hollywood star Brad 
Pitt, was dressed in a simple white blazer and white flared skirt.

She 
made her way around various charity stalls and exhibits at the ExCel 
centre accompanied by  a smiling Mr Hague.

The Hollywood star greeted a fan who grabbed her attention and passed her an envelope ahead of the four-day summit

An unsigned note written by Angelina Jolie was pictured today at the opening of the four-day summit on sexual violence in war. It read: 'All voices are valuable. Everyone. And All women and girls must be heard.'

Far
 more impressed by Miss Jolie than the Foreign Secretary, crowds of 
visitors followed their every move, camera phones held aloft in the hope
 of a photograph with her.

One picture of  Miss Jolie and Mr Hague, 
posted on Twitter, had the rather uncharitable caption: ‘Brad Pitt 
hasn’t aged  very well.’

Other
 celebrities attending the event included Stella McCartney, who also 
dressed in a flowing white outfit. 

While Mr Hague and Miss Jolie may 
seem an odd  couple, even by the standards of Hollywood, they have made a
 number of visits to war zones around the  world together.

Last year Oscar winner Miss Jolie was named by Forbes magazine as Hollywood’s highest-paid actress.

The global 
summit - End Sexual Violence in Conflict - is a four-day event and this 
morning Mr Hague and Jolie will open the Global Summit Fringe, which 
aims to increase awareness of sexual violence in conflict.

They will also take part in meetings with youth delegates.

Tomorrow they will attend an event to launch the international protocol to help strengthen prosecutions for rape in conflict.

On
 Thursday, delegations from more than 100 countries will attend and Mr 
Hague will chair a ministerial meeting on security in northern Nigeria.

On
 Friday, Mr Hague, Jolie, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and US 
Secretary of State John Kerry will speak in a closing plenary session.

From today until Thursday there will be some 140 free events open to the public.

Events and performances include the Royal Court Theatre presenting the world premiere of award-winning Liberian Girl.

There
 will be an exclusive screening of In The Land Of Blood And Honey, with 
the opportunity to hear its director Jolie and Mr Hague discuss the film
 and how it inspired the initiative that led to the summit.

As
 part of the #TimetoAct campaign, a short animation has been produced to
 portray the horror of rape and sexual violence through the eyes of a 
child.

William Hague and Angelina Jolie have formed an unlikely partnership in their battle to end sexual violence in war

Angelina Jolie's attendance at today's Global Summit on Ending Sexual Violence in Conflict is the culmination of 10 years work on the subject

Angelina Jolie may be one of the world’s most famous stars but she has got 'credential as well as celebrity', according to a senior director at a children’s charity.

The Special Envoy for the UN Commissioner for Refugees and star of action adventure film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider has a 'strong track record of knowing what she’s talking about'.

Jolie’s interest in humanitarian affairs was piqued in 2000 when she went to Cambodia to film Tomb Raider, according to The UN Refugee Agency Website.

She was named a Goodwill Ambassador in 2001 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

In 2012, High Commissioner Antonio Guterres appointed Jolie as his Special Envoy.

Anita Tiessen, deputy executive director of children’s charity Unicef UK, said that while she brings her fame to the summit she also brings experience.

Ms Tiessen talked about the impact of the 2011 film written and directed by Jolie called In the Land of Blood and Honey which is set during the Bosnian war.

'I think Angelina herself has shown a big commitment to the issue over the last ten years that she’s been an envoy for the issue.

'So yes she clearly brings her fame to the issue and so that attracts a lot of media. But I think she’s got a strong track record of knowing what she’s talking about, of really taking action.

'I was recently in a meeting and the film that she did about rape and abuse during the Bosnian conflict, I heard somebody say very, very powerfully that what that’s done is that it’s made it possible for people in Bosnia to talk about things that they’ve been keeping inside for a long, long time, so I think she’s got credential as well as celebrity,' she said.

Ms Tiessen said she believes the summit is going to be 'hugely significant', and said there has been a build-up of about 18 months of work led by Foreign Secretary William Hague.

She also said she thinks the week 'will be very, very emotionally charged'.

'I’ve heard children talk about how they’ve been sexually abused, or how they’ve been threatened with sexual abuse, and clearly it’s a very, very...it cuts close to the bone.

'It’s not something that people talk about easily,' she said.
