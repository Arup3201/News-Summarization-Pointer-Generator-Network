The Chancellor in Glasgow on Monday: He has vowed to spend billions on a 'Crossrail of the North' to give an economic boost to Manchester and Leeds

George Osborne says it is better to spend public money on transport links in the North than continuing to fund so many people on welfare.

The Chancellor yesterday pledged billions to fund a ‘Crossrail of the North’ to prevent cities such as Manchester and Leeds from lagging behind London and the south.

He said that although the plans could cost as much as £15billion, the benefits that would accrue in terms of prosperity would be better than spending so much on benefits.

Mr Osborne said that if the GDP of the north of England was brought up to the UK average, it would be worth an extra £56billion to the northern economy over the next 18 years – the equivalent of £1,600 per household.  

He told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that governments should not have to choose between investing in the north or the south of the country.

‘I hope we don’t have to make a choice between the two,’ he said.

‘I think the real choice in our country is actually spending money on this big economic infrastructure, trans-Pennine rail links, Crossrail 2 in London and the like, and spending money on, for example, welfare payments which are not generating either a real economic return and at the same time, are trapping people in poverty.’

At an event in Manchester, he backed a report by the leaders of the cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Newcastle who call for £15billion of investment to improve road and rail links.

The Chancellor described cost in the One North report as ‘affordable’ – and that is was necessary to make it easier to travel between the cities to enable them to compete with London.

The report said that if adopted, the 15-year investment plan, which complements the HS2 proposals, could deliver benefits for the whole of the North of England including up to 150 per cent additional capacity on roads and as much as 55 per cent quicker journey times on a faster, more frequent interconnected rail network.

Mr Osborne said: ‘Of course £15billion is a lot of money – it’s about the size of the Crossrail project in London.

‘It’s a project over a number of years, out to 2030. We have got a £100 billion capital budget to the end of the decade. I think this kind of proposal is affordable.’

Mr Osborne has said he wants to build a ‘Northern powerhouse’ around the major cities of the North, whose legacy of heavy industry has led to an economic performance lagging behind the rest of the UK.

The Chancellor also said that this autumn there will be new proposals on transferring more power and a bigger say over how money is spent, from Whitehall, to the cities and regions in a ‘new model of city governance’.

He added: ‘I’m prepared to roll up my sleeves and get it done, so let’s get on with it’.

Mr Osborne said if the Government and the cities could get the economic performance of the North to match the rest of the UK, it would add billions to the wealth of the nation and ‘rebalance’ the economy from an over-reliance on the City, London and the South East.

The One North plans also include increased road capacity for both freight and personal travel through extended motorways, improving links to ports and airports and fast and frequent intercity rail links, all interconnected with HS2, the super-fast North-South rail project from London.

Labour Treasury spokeswoman Shabana Mahmood said: ‘Only Labour will properly back our city and county regions with ambitious plans to devolve more funding and economic power to them.

‘Mr Osborne will be judged on his actions, not his words. He is failing to back the Heseltine report or Labour’s plans to devolve billions of pounds of funding.’

Figures from the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) show the North has fared badly in terms of investment in the past.

Ed Cox, director of IPPR North, said planned spending of public money on transport infrastructure in the National Infrastructure Plan was £5,312 per person in London but in the North West it was £420 per person and the North East just £157 per person.
