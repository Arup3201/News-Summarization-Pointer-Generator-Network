Ukip supporters and Eurosceptic Tories are making it harder to stop Scotland voting to leave the UK, Vince Cable will warn today.

The Lib Dem Business Secretary will use a speech tonight to accuse right-wing parties of British ‘indulging in British nationalism and Euro-separatism’.

He will tell his party’s spring conference in York that people calling for Britain to leave the EU made it harder to persuade Scots to ignore the ‘siren voices of nationalism and separatism’.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable accuses Ukip of putting the union at risk

Voters in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18.

Senior Conservatives are conscious that the arguments about Scotland remaining in the UK, including on employment, economy and global influence, also apply to Britain’s EU membership.

David Cameron has promised to negotiate a ‘fresh settlement’ with Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

But Mr Cable will warn the uncertainty is damaging the British economy, with the Tories plunged into a ‘UKIP induced funk’. 

He will say: ‘The possibility of a Tory government after the election and the uncertainty around a referendum in three years’ time is creating a blight over the business investment which we desperately need to support recovery and jobs.

‘And let me say this to UKIP and so-called Eurosceptics in the Tory party.  You are also putting at risk the union of the UK. 

‘How on Earth do you expect to persuade 
the Scots to ignore the siren voices of nationalism and separatism when 
you indulge in British nationalism and Euro-separatism?’

The rise of Nigel Farage's Ukip has put pressure on the Tory party to present a more Eurosceptic front

Some members of the UK Independence Party are  ‘literally akin to the Nazis’, according to a Tory MP.

In
 an incendiary attack ahead of the European elections, Robert Halfon 
said the anti-EU party had played a helpful role in ‘cleansing’ the 
Conservatives of people with extreme views.

Mr
 Halfon, an ally of Chancellor George Osborne and Tory chairman Grant 
Shapps, cited the example of UKIP immigration spokesman Gerard Batten, 
who believes that British Muslims should sign a special code of conduct 
rejecting violence.

Mr Halfon, who is 
Jewish, said: ‘To me there are two kinds of UKIP – the [former defence 
spokesman] Godfrey Bloom guy who’s like a cross between Sid James and 
Bernard Manning, and then there's a much more sinister element, like the
 MEP who said every Muslim has got to sign a declaration of 
non-violence, which to me is literally akin to the Nazis saying Jews 
should wear a yellow star.

‘I
 genuinely find it abhorrent and frightening. I'm amazed that man is 
still an MEP. How someone could say such a thing and then not apologise 
for it…’

The pro-independence campaign has suffered a string of setbacks this week, with big business lining up to warn against separation.

Investment and savings business Alliance Trust today became the latest firm to say it is to set up additional companies in England as a result of uncertainty surrounding the independence referendum.

The 125-year-old Dundee-based business said it was taking the precaution in order to protect its customers regardless of the outcome in September. The trust currently has offices in Dundee, Edinburgh and London.

In a statement outlining the company's annual results, chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox said: ‘2014 is an important year for Scotland. The referendum in September is creating uncertainty for our customers and our business, which we have a responsibility to address.’

It follows warnings from oil giants BP and Shell, banks RBS and Lloyds and pensions firm Standard Life about the threat to their business and investment caused by Scotland going it alone.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has also struggled to counter the warning from the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems that they would block a currency union allowing an independent Scotland to continue using the pound.

Mr Salmond has accused the Westminster parties of ‘bullying and bluster’, and insisted a currency union could still be agreed if voters back independence.

But today Lib Dem Danny Alexander will insist the decision is final. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury will say: ‘I've seen some people suggest we are not serious about refusing a currency union.

‘Let's call this the John McEnroe defence. Except in this instance it's not just one person they're shouting at, but three.

‘And our decision - taken in the best interests of Scotland and the rest of the UK - is final.

‘No ifs, no buts. No matter how much of a racket they make, it isn't going to change.’

Generator and heating supplier Aggreko warned yesterday that Scottish independence would lead to 'years of uncertainty and hiatus' for the business.

Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, the Macfarlane Group and Breedon Aggregates have all listed independence in their risk management sections of their annual reports.

But other high-profile business figures have voiced support for independence, including Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways' parent company, who said last month that a Yes vote in September could be a 'positive development'.
