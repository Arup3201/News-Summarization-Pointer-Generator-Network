Five children and two men have been rescued after being stranded in the Australian outback for four days - but not before courageous efforts by the two adults.

When their vehicle broke down in the harsh Kimberley region of north-west Western Australia, they survived on what food and water they had, while two of the children used up their asthma inhalers.But it was not the typically baking heat of the desert that had caused their plight.

What caused them trouble was lashing rain that had flooded the rough outback. It put such a strain on their old vehicle that it broke down.

The children were close to running out of food when they were rescued

After surviving on what little supplies they had for four days one of the men decided to set off to seek help - and walked 30 miles across the soggy sand before he was found in a weakened state by a youth worker travelling on another road to an Aboriginal settlement.

In the meantime the father of the five children - the youngsters were aged between three and 11 - decided to set off for help, too, and risked his life by swimming across a river while carrying a full petrol can and then walking to a cattle station.

He told workers there that his children had hardly any food left and they were boiling water they had scooped up to drink.

The group was seen by a spotter plane, then picked up by police helicopter

He was able to send a message to the emergency services from there, before swimming back across the river and returning to the broken-down vehicle to comfort his children.

With the alarm raised now from two places, a spotter aircraft set off across the desert to look for the stranded vehicle. To the relief of the pilot, he saw the children waving up at the aircraft.

Later a police helicopter made two trips to the vehicle to pick up the children and their father. The family have yet to be named.

The group was stranded in an extremely harsh environment

'They had limited food and water supplies when found,' said police spokesman Sam Dinnison. 'Two of the children had also run out of their asthma medication.'

The group, who had set off from Darwin to Halls Creek on the unsealed Duncan Highway in a four-wheel-drive vehicle last Friday, ran into trouble when they tried to cross a flooded creek.

'They were driving in an area that's had a lot of torrential rain recently and we believe they've entered floodwaters with the vehicle, which has caused it to break down.'

With the family being flown to safety at Halls Creek - and the man who had first set out being due to arrive later - police turned their attention to other motorists stranded by the flood waters.

Helicopters were being used to deliver food and water to them in the Kimberley region after the Great Northern Highway was cut off by rising waters east of Fitzroy Crossing.

Mr Richard Omen, who works at a roadside filling station and cafe, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that traffic was banked up, including up to 25 large trucks.

'There's quite a few of them stuck and they've ended up having to find accommodation here,' he said.

Police said they have been keeping in touch with two women and two truck drivers who spent two nights stuck on a small section of highway isolated by floodwaters.Â
