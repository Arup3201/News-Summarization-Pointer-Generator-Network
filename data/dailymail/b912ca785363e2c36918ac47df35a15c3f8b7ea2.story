The head of the Women's Institute today called for all children to be taught cookery at school to help tackle the 'obesity timebomb' and stop them wasting so much food.

Ruth Bond, whose organisation has more than 200,000 members, believes compulsory lessons on the national curriculum would prepare pupils for adult life.

Her comments come after the WI launched a food security campaign in an attempt to reduce the 15million tonnes of food Britain throws away each year.

'Excellent thing': Head of the Women's Institute Ruth Bond has called for all children to be taught cookery at school to improve their health and stop food wastage

Ministers are also considering whether to force schools to increase culinary teaching.

Mrs Bond said the education system had 'fallen down' because cookery lessons were not 'taught widely'.

She told MailOnline: 'Good, healthy cooking leads to a healthy lifestyle. It is a holistic approach. We don't want food wasted, but that is an issue in itself. This is a health issue as well.

'If you give children these skills at an early age, it would go some way to tackling the obesity timebomb'.

Mrs Bond said lessons should focus on the basics, such as not over-cooking potatoes and how to buy and plan meals.

She said the demands of modern life 
meant many children were living on a diet of ready meals because their 
parents were often too busy to cook.

It
 would also help if more parents got their children into the kitchen 
with them, added Mrs Bond, who admitted she was 'fortunate' to learn 
from a mother who taught the subject.

She added that the WI, which has around 210,000 members in 6,500 branches, holds regular home-cooking courses for young parents so they can plan meals at home more effectively.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she said a useful tip would be to adapt recipes from books to include ingredients that need using up.

She said: 'It is a case of planning 
what you are going to eat, make your list, and look in your cupboard to 
see if there is anything that would do.'

Mrs
 Bond also suggested that best-before dates do not have to be followed 
too religiously, especially if the food has not gone mouldy.

Getting stuck in: Mrs Bond has also urged parents to encourage their children to help cook at home

The WI has enjoyed a long history of campaigning on behalf of women and their communities 

Here's a snapshot of some of the battles they have fought:

The WI's first campaign was on school dinner provision in 1926.

In 1943, almost 30 years before the law changed, a resolution from Bures WI in West Suffolk demanding equal pay for equal work was passed at the AGM.

In 1954, a resolution against litter was passed which eventually led to the formation of Keep Britain Tidy.

In 1964 Hellesdon WI in Norfolk won the support of the AGM on a resolution against smoking in public places.

During the 1970s, the WI lobbied for the introduction of breast screening clinics – this resulted in the government introducing a number of mobile screening clinics followed by a national screening programme for all women aged 50 – 64, the first of its kind in the EU.

The 80s saw the WI call for public facing information campaigns on HIV and AIDs.

More recently the WI has worked to raise awareness on the nature and extent of violence against women, tackled excess packaging and focussed on the plight of the honeybee.

A Department for Education spokesman 
said: 'Decisions on the subjects to be included in the secondary 
National Curriculum will be announced in due course, but nothing will 
prevent schools from teaching practical cookery.

'We know that a healthy attitude towards food, developed early, is critical to the health and well-being of young people.

'We
 are currently looking at the role food and cooking plays in schools and
 how this can help children develop an understanding of food and 
nutrition.'

The WI was set up during the First World War to encourage women to tighten their belts and make the most of their meagre household budgets.

Last month, it was revealed that, due to the recession, record numbers of young women are once again turning to the organisation to learn vital 'make do and mend' skills.

In the last three years, 56,500 women have joined the WI, which has a total membership of around 210,000 in England and Wales.

The influence of the WI was highlighted in 2007 when Marks & Spencer credited the organisation with turning its fortunes around.

Facing falling sales amid accusations that the store had stopped listening to its customers, then chief executive Stuart Rose turned to the WI for help.

About 800 WI members in Kent, Buckinghamshire and Leicestershire were invited to form a focus group which would help guide the company.

They gave precise guidance on how to improve individual garments - advice which the store said has helped it improve its profits.

It even credited members for doubling the order of a fluted printed skirt on sale in some stores the previous year.

The women gave the nod of approval to several items which went on to become hits, including last season's checked waterfallfront jacket, modelled by Twiggy in advertisements.

The organisation was created in 1915 and is preparing for its centenary in 2015.
