The last time Tottenham won at the Emirates, Rihanna’s ‘Only Girl in the World’ was No 1, WikiLeaks were in the process of releasing 250,000 American diplomatic cables and Roy Hodgson was wreaking the sort of havoc at Liverpool that wasn't rectified for years.

It was also around that period that a certain Gareth Bale began to make good on his early promise and become a driving force for Spurs. His goal, at 2-0 down, proved the catalyst to three precious points. Rafael Van der Vaart equalised before Younes Kaboul notched a late winner.

Since then, however, Tottenham have stagnated. They’re on a third manager since Harry Redknapp departed and don’t appear to be capable of touching the top four just yet. As we embark on the first north London derby of this season, Sportsmail picks a composite XI of Arsenal and Spurs ahead of the clash.

It was an afternoon to forget for Arsene Wenger but results since have been favourable at the Emirates

Goalkeeper: Hugo Lloris

While Wojciech Szczesny has become a more imposing figure between the sticks in the last 12 months, Lloris is a complete goalkeeper. Both are exemplary shot stoppers, but the Frenchman’s savvy reading of the game in acting as a sweeper pips it.

France international Hugo Lloris trumps Wojciech Szczesny to take the gloves in our composite XI

Right-back: Calum Chambers

Isn’t a right-back, but neither club are blessed with genuine quality in that area. Chambers is very impressive when play is ahead of him – already an astute reader of the game – and he’s no slouch going the other way.

Summer signing Calum Chambers has made an impressive start to his Arsenal career

Central defender: Per Mertesacker

Carries on surprising people. The poster boy for Arsenal’s failings during his first season, Mertesacker has relished the opportunity to go and dominate Premier League defenders after Arsene Wenger’s decision to drop his back four a touch deeper. There is a strong argument for Jan Vertonghen’s inclusion but the German is more consistent.

Per Mertesacker is a commanding presence at the heart of Arsenal's defence

Central defender: Laurent Koscielny

Still has a mistake in his locker every now and then but Koscielny’s pace and bravery make him quite the asset. On his day one of the best in the division. It is a shame from an Arsenal point of view that his day isn’t every week.

Laurent Koscielny also makes our composite team and will play alongside Mertesacker

Left-back: Kieran Gibbs

Take away the injuries and here we have England’s best left-back. This is judged merely on ability – not taking into account fitness problems – and Gibbs is able to join in while also an intelligent defender, rarely committing before his winger.

Kieran Gibbs gets the nod at left-back and is an accomplished and intelligent player

Central midfielder: Etienne Capoue

Might not be everybody’s cup of tea in midfield, but is powerful enough to make an impact on the Premier League. When you consider his main rival from a Gunners perspective is the passive Mikel Arteta, there is definitely room for the £9million summer signing from Toulouse. Brings much-needed steel to the side.

Central midfielder: Jack Wilshere

Has enjoyed a decent start to the season, despite his ludicrously harsh critics. Off the field problems are admittedly Wilshere’s own fault, but his performances are steadily improving. There’s still much to do if he is to become the blockbuster midfielder once tipped.

Jack Wilshere has made a decent start to the season for Arsenal but still attracts criticism

Attacking midfielder: Christian Eriksen

A close call between the Dane and Mesut Ozil, but Eriksen pips him purely because he positively affects more games. The 22-year-old’s vision around the box is a joy to watch, while you always believe there is a purpose to his play. Ozil, even though he has started brightly this term, can flit in and out.

Christian Eriksen gets the pick ahead of Mesut Ozil in the attacking midfield slot

Attacking midfielder: Aaron Ramsey

Simply put: a superstar. Ramsey is Arsenal’s proper game-changing midfielder, popping up with vital goals and capable of driving the Gunners forward. Head and shoulders above the rest on either side.

Aaron Ramsey has turned in consistently brilliant performances for Arsenal over the last couple of seasons

Attacking midfielder: Alexis Sanchez

Clearly needs time to settle into English football, but showing signs that he is the match-winner Wenger thought he was buying after the World Cup. Free-kick in midweek was stunning but it is nose for goal in the box that should shine through. Given the opportunity to play more central Sanchez’s pace and clever running could see him fire Arsenal to more trophies.

Alexis Sanchez has made a storming start to his Arsenal career and scored a cracking free-kick in midweek

Striker: Danny Welbeck

Wanted by Tottenham in the close season, Welbeck would get into either of these teams. Is forever a willing runner and - if he spends extra time finessing his finishing at London Colney - could prove to be a snip at £16million. Roberto Soldado doesn’t make the bench.
