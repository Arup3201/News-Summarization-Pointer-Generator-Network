Boys roll in mud and climb trees, while girls prefer sitting quietly and playing with dolls.

Or at least that’s what adverts for Clarks shoes would have you believe – triggering an online backlash from parents who complain the firm is being ‘sexist and offensive’.

The shoe shop has been accused of gender stereotyping on its posters which suggest boys need hard-wearing shoes for running around, while girls are more concerned with looking pretty.

Gender stereotyping: This slogan for Clarks shoes in Stratford, London, prompted 3,000 complaints online

One of the adverts, which are displayed in store, proclaims in blue: ‘Because boys test their shoes to destruction, so do we.’

Another poster, in pink, says: ‘Because girls love comfort and style, we design both into our shoes.’

Last night the firm said it was ‘never our intention to cause offence’ as it faced a barrage of complaints on Twitter.

Emma Dixon, a lawyer from Islington, north London, and mother of two boys and a girl, launched an online petition calling for the removal of the adverts, which last night had been signed by more than 3,000 people.

She said: ‘I was horrified to find gender stereotyped notices above the boys’ and girls’ shoes.

‘These offensive posters suggest boys are active while girls are passively pretty.

Pretty in pink: A Clarks spokesman insisted the font colour was not intended to cause any offence

‘Gender stereotyping has an important 
effect on children’s development. To suggest that boys engage in active 
outdoor play of the type that destroys shoes, while girls are interested
 in fashion and looking pretty, is to reinforce damaging social 
stereotypes.

‘I grew up in 
the carefree 1970s when kids were kids and my brother and I wore 
matching outfits on a regular basis.

'I’m a mum to a girl and two boys, 
so I know how important it is for kids to grow up with the space to be 
who they are, not who someone else thinks they ought to be.’

Clarks is famous as a high street institution renowned for helping children find their first shoes and ‘back to school’ footwear.

Founded in 1825, Clarks is still based in Street, Somerset, and sells more than 50million pairs of shoes a year, recently posting a record turnover of £1.4billion.

A spokesman for Clarks said: ‘The wording in these in-store marketing displays was chosen to reference qualities that our customers value in children’s shoes. It is never our intention to cause offence.

Lawyer Emma Dixon, from Islington in north London, set up a petition which has had more than 3,000 signatures

‘All of our marketing materials are designed to showcase qualities including design, quality, comfort and style, and all our shoes are tested to destruction.

'These are attributes we are very proud to be associated with after 185 years in the shoe business.

'As part of the regular seasonal changeover of in-store signage, we are in the process of updating all current in-store marketing for Autumn/Winter 2014.’

It is not the first retailer to fall foul of sexist language.

Last year, Boots admitted it was wrong to use separate signs labelling girls’ and boys’ toys - putting Science Museum-brand toys in the latter category - after outraged shoppers took to Twitter and Facebook.

Tesco also came under fire for labelling a children’s chemistry set a boys’ toy.

And Harrods had to apologise for stocking books entitled ‘How To Be Gorgeous’, which encouraged girls to ‘look stylish’, and ‘How To Be Clever’, helping boys to ‘remember things’.
