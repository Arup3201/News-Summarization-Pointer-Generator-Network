It seems that Hollywood may no longer be the place to go if you want to get rich and famous.

A recent breakdown of Tinseltown salaries in The Hollywood Reporter noted that jobs out in sunny California were not only paying less, but getting harder and harder to come by.

That being said, it was a great year to be Leonardo DiCaprio in 2013 - just not so much Jonah Hill.

For his work in The Wolf of Wall Street, DiCaprio pocketed a very nice $25 million, while his less genetically blessed costar, Hill, only took home $600,000.

Both also walked away from the project with Oscar nominations.

When it comes to making bank however, it is all about the back end, something stars like Sandra Bullock and Robert Downey Jr. profited hugely from in 2013.

Downey took home $75 million thanks to getting 7% of the earnings from the Marvel blockbuster Iron Man 3, while Bullock really had cause to celebrate after a 15 percent, first-dollar deal on Gravity, a film that made over $700 million worldwide and, as a result, netted her over $70 million.

Her efforts also earned her another Best Actress nomination.

If film isn't working out however, television is still very welcoming to former big screen stars, with studios getting out their checkbooks for ladies like Halle Berry, Tea Leoni and even Katherine Heigl, who will all appear in American homes every week this season at the cost of $150,000 an episode.

Then there is Crystal the monkey, an adorable little creature who earned $108,000 in 2012 for appearing on just nine episodes of the failed NBC sitcom Animal Practice.

Had it gone the entire season, she would have taken home $264,000. 

That's a whole lot more than her porn star pals in the San Fernando Valley are taking home, averaging a salary of $120,000 for an entire year's worth of far more rigorous work.

The biggest problem facing many in Hollywood now is that many productions are moving to Louisiana, Georgia and other low-cost states, grabbing local workers who cost far, far less.

A stunt person in Los Angeles commands a far higher sum, around $50,000 a film, than a stunt person working in another low-cost state, and to keep costs down many productions are happy to film on location.

As for the $50,000, that may seem like a lot, until one takes into account the huge insurance premiums these men and women pay given their line of work. 

And it does not pay to get hurt.

'I was doubling for Jim Carey in Yes Man, on the back of a scooter on Sunset Boulevard with the girl doubling as Zoeey Deschanel,' recalled stuntman Tom McComas. 

'A car that was supposed to slide by us hit us at 50 miles per hour. She shattered her pelvis; I jumped, flipped in the air and herniated a couple of disks.'

He went to work the next day, got fired, and was suddenly collecting disability rather than a paycheck.

'Basically we're blue-collar workers who punch the clock,' he added.

Speaking of Yes Man, Carey took home 36.2% on the back end of the 2008 release according to Deadline, a move they mocked the actor for at the time as he agreed to forgo any salary for the film.

The film made almost $225 million at the box office, which comes out to a little more than $81 million.

Even better, Carey herniated no discs during production.
