You may have been hoping for a flaming June but, if the forecasts are correct, it is going to be a washout in Britain.

And as a foretaste, torrential rain is expected today to bring flash flooding, with some places told to expect more than an inch of rain in 24 hours.

The plans of families across the country for barbecues, garden parties, fetes and festivals may have to be revised – in some cases, rather hastily.

The Environment Agency issued 16 flood alerts today for areas in the Midlands, East Anglia and the South East.

Flooding: Lynsey Hannant, a 28-year-old nurse, posted this photograph on Twitter of a car driving through floodwater on a road in Norwich, Norfolk, yesterday

Rising levels: Miss Hannant also took this photograph of floodwater in Norwich, saying: 'Never seen it so bad'

Norwich problems: The Environment Agency had 16 flood alerts in place this morning for areas in the Midlands, East Anglia and the South East

Rain won't stop them: A couple take photograph of the sights in London yesterday with the City in the background

Unpleasant: Tourists shelter under umbrellas near London Bridge on a miserable day in the capital

Keeping their distance: Driving conditions are treacherous on the M25 towards Dartford Crossing as heavy rain hits parts of Britain

The
 heaviest rain is expected in Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and along 
the east coast, where some parts could see a fortnight’s worth of rain 
in a few hours.

The Met Office also issued a yellow warning – a moderate
 risk of severe weather – alerting people to potential travel chaos as 
‘heavy and persistent’ rain sweeps up the country.

Officials warned households to ‘be prepared’ for possible flooding.

Its
 alerts, including several for  villages along rivers in the Home 
Counties, said: ‘There may be some flooding of low-lying land and roads,
 some disruption to travel and possibly flooding to individual 
properties.’

The wet weather is due to a depression blowing in from the Continent.

A
 Met Office spokesman said: ‘Looking ahead through the rest of this week
 there is more rain to come, particularly for eastern and north-eastern 
England, while Scotland, especially the north, has the best of the warm,
 sunny weather.

Traffic trouble: Heavy rain is causing problems on the M25 near the Dartford Crossing in Kent, with speed restrictions in place due to the bad weather

Covered up: Tourists wear rain ponchos on Westminster Bridge near the Houses of Parliament in Central London

Seeing the sights: A woman carries an umbrella on Westminster Bridge near the Houses of Parliament in Central London

In a row: Commuters shelter under umbrellas in Southwark, central London, as rain sweeps across the UK

Umbrellas at the ready: Commuters battle through heavy rain outside Bromley South train station in south-east London yesterday morning

Avoiding the puddles: Heavy rain this morning for commuters at Bromley South train station as the wet conditions continued across Britain

Taking cover: A pregnant woman takes shelter under an umbrella while a cyclist makes his way through heavy rain yesterday outside Bromley South train station

Sheep may safely graze: The sun rises above the Hope Valley in Derbyshire's Peak District yesterday morning

‘Suffolk has
 already seen heavy rainfall through Tuesday morning with over 30mm (1.2
 inches) of rainfall at Wattisham through the first nine hours of the 
day.

‘Wednesday will again be wet for many, especially around north-east
 England with parts of Yorkshire at risk of over 30mm. With 
strengthening winds, this will make it feel quite unpleasant at times.’

But, it added: ‘Things should turn generally drier, brighter and warmer by the weekend.’

There
 is little consolation in the Met Office UK outlook for June 2 to June 
9, updated yesterday, which warned: ‘The weather is likely to stay 
changeable with showers or longer spells of rain accompanied by breezy 
conditions at times, particularly across western areas at first.’

The
 outlook for June 10 to 24 is hardly any more encouraging: ‘Changeable 
weather looks more likely than not to persist into mid-June.

‘As
 such, conditions would then be mixed with showers or longer spells of 
rain, particularly for western areas, interspersed by some drier, 
brighter periods for most parts of the UK.

Flooding was seen in Norwich, 
Norfolk - with local nurse Lynsey Hannant, 28, taking photographs of 
cars making their way through the water.

Forecast: The plans of families across the country for summer barbecues, garden parties, fetes and festivals may have to be revised

Looking ahead: Showers are predicted for the rest of the week, with drier weather towards the weekend

Map: The Environment Agency issued 16 flood alerts today for areas in the Midlands, East Anglia and the South East

Showers
 are predicted for the rest of the week, with drier weather towards the 
weekend - but there is no sign of hot weather similar to earlier this month

The
 average rainfall for May is around 50mm (2in) but the north was told it can expect 
up to 40mm (1.6in) of rainfall yesterday and today alone.

Claire 
Austin, a forecaster at Meteogroup, said: ‘We’ve got low pressure coming
 in from the south, which is causing the wetter weather.

‘It’s
 going to stay changeable through much of the week, and the weather will
 improve towards the weekend, but temperatures will stay fairly average 
for this time of year.’

After
 some parts of Britain saw warmer stormy weather on Saturday and Sunday,
 temperatures will return to normal for this time of year, which for May
 is between 8C (46F) and 18C (64F).

Watch out: A Met Office yellow 'be aware' weather warning for Yorkshire today

Today: Rain
 will continue across parts of England, although gradually easing 
through the day. Elsewhere it will stay cloudy, although some limited 
brighter spells are possible, but also isolated showers.

Outlook for tomorrow to Saturday: It
 will slowly turn drier and brighter during Thursday with rain 
continuing to ease. Bright or sunny spells and variable cloud follows on
 Friday and Saturday, but also isolated showers

UK outlook for May 31 to June 9: Largely
 cloudy but mainly dry conditions are expected through Saturday although
 a few showers may develop across western areas. Through Sunday, more 
persistent rain across western areas is likely to push east through the 
day, with sunshine and showers following. The rain may well turn heavy 
for a time as it moves eastwards. Whilst temperatures will be near 
normal, it will feel cool with the rain. The weather is likely to stay 
changeable thereafter with showers or longer spells of rain accompanied 
by breezy conditions at times, particularly across western areas at 
first. Despite this, there will be some warmer, drier and sunnier spells
 but with the risk of some chilly nights for the time of year.

UK outlook for June 10 to June 24: Changeable
 weather looks more likely than not to persist into mid-June. As such, 
conditions would then be mixed with showers or longer spells of rain, 
particularly for western areas, interspersed by some drier, brighter 
periods for most parts of the UK. Later in the month, there are signs 
beginning to emerge of a change towards more settled conditions, at 
least for the north of the UK. Temperatures are likely to be near or 
just below average during unsettled weather and near average or rather 
warm during brighter, more settled spells.
