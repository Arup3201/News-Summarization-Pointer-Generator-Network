Have you noticed Rachel and Ross sounding slightly high-pitched in reruns of Friends episodes?

If so, it could be because your TV network is speeding up these classic shows to squeeze in a few more seconds of advertising time.

The sneaky tactic has been highlighted in a YouTube clip which shows the speed difference between an original copy of a Seinfeld episode and a recent TBS rerun.

The sneaky tactic has been highlighted in a YouTube clip which shows the speed difference between an original copy of a Seinfeld episode and a recent TBS rerun

Pennsylvania-based company Prime Image uses a tool known as Time Tailor.

The technology analyses both the video and audio programs and drops segments of video and audio which contain identical or 'like' information to that of the neighboring segment.

A five per cent time reduction means that a 15 second commercial can be inserted into a five minute program 

In the YouTube video, the increase in playback speed in the footage would allow for two additional minutes of commercials in a single half-hour episode. 

Other methods of time reduction work by playing a pre-recorded program from a tape machine faster than normal speed. 

These methods have the adverse effect of altering the audio's pitch and requires pitch-correction technology to prevent people from sounding like chipmunks.

The increase in playback speed in the footage would allow for two additional minutes of commercials in a single half-hour episode.

Viewers have also noticed the change, with many reporting that their much-loved characters sound subtly different.

TBS is believed to have sped up sitcom reruns of 'Seinfeld', and Viacom Inc's TV Land used the same tactic with 'Friends' reruns, according to a report by Joe Flint at the Wall Street journal.

And it isn't the first time TV networks have tried to shorten reruns. Similar techniques include cutting the opening sequence, speeding up the closing sequence and overlapping the next show.

For instance, reruns of 'Law & Order' on TNT have a 24-second opening, compared to the original 1 minute, 45-second opening when it aired on NBC.

Pennsylvania-based company Prime Image uses a tool known as Time Tailor to shorten sitcoms. 

The technology analyses both the video and audio programs and drops segments of video and audio which contain identical or 'like' information to that of the neighboring segment. 

'This method is unlike anything available in the market today, the company claims. 'By design, this process does not affect the pitch of the audio.

Other methods of time reduction work by playing a pre-recorded program from a tape machine faster than normal speed. 

'That method has the adverse effect of altering the audio's pitch and requires pitch-correction technology to prevent people from sounding like chipmunks.' it said. 

 But the trick could ultimately back fire, experts claim.

'It is important for us to consider the effect this is having on the viewer experience,' Jackie Kulesza, executive vice president and director of video at Starcom USA told Wall Street Journal

A&E Network averaged 18 minutes and 39 seconds of commercial time per-hour in prime time, which is up three minutes from December 2013, according to an analysis by Nielson. The History Channel, meanwhile, had 18 minutes and 42 seconds of ad time, up two minutes from the previous year

For years, there have been rumours of Apple launching a TV - with Steve Jobs even famously telling his biographer the firm had 'cracked' the problem.

However, now it appears the firm's plans may finally begin to be seen outside the company's super secret Cupertino labs.

It is believed to be talking to TV programmers about a streaming service that could rival Netflix.

It say the service would put together bundles of programming, rather than entire TV lineups.

Instead, it could offer its own system, possibly with new ways to interact, with its own interface and user experience.

Apple has shown programmers demos of the proposed service, sources told re/code.

'But talks seem to be in the early stages, which means terms like pricing and timing aren't close to being ironed out.'

The History Channel, meanwhile, had 18 minutes and 42 seconds of ad time, up two minutes from the previous year.

Other networks accused of speeding up reruns include, TBS the Discovery Channel and TLC.

According to the Wall Street Journal a senior executive at one major cable programmer said the speeding up of shows, which is done by removing repetitive video frames, is a last resort.

However, the source said the practice, which has gone on for decades, seems to have become more prevalent in the past few years.

Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman is believed to have described the practice as 'wrong', claiming that her work has been manipulated to appear in a way that she had not intended.

The change comes at a time when advertisers are cutting their spending on able networks by an estimated four per cent, as they move their money to web-based sources.

Last year, it was revealed that Procter & Gamble, the largest U.S. ad-buyer, and General Motors among the companies scaling back their television advertising.

While cable networks had been strong in overall television ad business, those owned by media companies such as Time Warner , Walt Disney Co, 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc have suffered sagging ratings lately.

'Digital has finally begun to take a bite out of national TV budgets,' said one media buyer.
