The release of the iPhone 6 was eagerly anticipated all around the world.

But one Apple fan went to great lengths to ensure he was the first to get his hands on one, by changing time zones and flying down to Australia for the launch... just so he could drop the first iPhone 6 in a pitcher of beer. 

Canadian based musician Michael Mooney spent 22 hours on a plane so he could be the first to buy an iPhone in Brisbane, even paying the first people in the queue of 2,000 to hand over their handset. 

But it was no accident that the first iPhone 6 met such a sticky ending, Mr Mooney dropped it into his beer on purpose.

As part of a clever marketing ploy, the musician was working to promote a product that claims to revive phones even when they have been completely saturated.

Reviveaphone tasked Mr Mooney with acquiring the first iPhone 6 on the market, so he could test out the product with a fun video. 

So he headed to Australia, which was the first country to welcome the release date of September 19, due to time zone differences.

Mr Mooney is the lead signer of a Montreal Band called Le Trouble and a good friend of the production company that filmed the Reviveaphone video.

The video was shot from September 16 to September 19 and it involved flying Mr Mooney and two-man crew to Brisbane.  

Mr Mooney said, 'When the guys approached me with this crazy and beautiful idea, I had to go with it. What's funny is that nothing was guaranteed. Would we get to the store on time? Would we get the first phone? Of course, we were confident Reviveaphone would bring the iPhone back to life, but it was all a big gamble... Those four days were totally hectic, and boy did we have fun!'

Dying: The iPhone 6 is placed in the pitcher where it quickly dies and the lights fade out

Second chance: Moments later Mr Mooney takes the phone out of the pitcher and introduces Revivaphone

On the day of the iPhone 6 release Mr Mooney is taken aback by the length of the queue and he says, 'O wow, that line keeps going, you just can't see the end of that line from here.'

During the entertaining video Mr Mooney comes to an agreement with the first two people in line for the iPhone 6 and he agrees to give his new friends thousands of dollars in return for the world's first iPhone 6.

The video then cuts to the morning of the iPhone 6 release and an excited Mr Mooney. He says, 'Our friends are being interviewed because they were the first in line but what they don't know is the first phone is mine.'

When Mr Mooney finally gets his hands on the iPhone 6 he kisses it and says, 'Thank you very much everybody, that one's mine. We came a long way for that b*****d.'

Drying: After he takes it out of the Revivaphone pouch he  leaves it outside to dry for 24 hours

Minutes later the musician can be seen in a hotel with a large jug of beer and his actions would undoubtedly shock most iPhone enthusiasts. 

Mr Mooney says, 'Ladies and gentlemen I'm now going to drop the world's first iPhone 6 into a full pitcher of beer.

As he drops the electronic device he says, 'Two thousand people lined up for this thing just then and we've just dropped it in beer?

Although the phone looks doomed as the display lights are extinguished as the beer infiltrates the device Mr Mooney then introduces the Riviveaphone.

Test: After the drying period Mr Mooney then takes it back inside and attempts to switch it on

Success: The apple logo lights up and following the Reviveaphone intervention the phone is working again 

He says, 'When you drop your phone in water or beer or whatever it's not the liquid that makes the thing die, it's the minerals in the liquid and somehow this stuff treats the minerals and works on the minerals. I don't know I'm not a scientist.'

Mr Mooney continues: 'You pour the liquid into the pouch and then stick the phone in and seal it. You leave this thing in for seven minutes and then you take it out and leave it to dry for 24 hours and you're good to go.

The video then cuts to Mr Mooney 24 hours later as he checks if the phone has been revived. 'This thing has been sitting outside for 24 hours drying and it is dry so I guess I'll turn it on.'

The lead singer is delighted to see the phone lights up. He adds, 'Please look at that, please, look at the apple and please see that that works.'
