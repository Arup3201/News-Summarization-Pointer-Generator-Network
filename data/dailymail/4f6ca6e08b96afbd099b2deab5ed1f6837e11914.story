With her new Vanity Fair and Telegraph columns, her Waitrose work and, of course, the christening of her new nephew, the last few months have been busy ones for Pippa Middleton.

But the aunt of the third in line to the throne still found time to nip into a Chelsea framing shop while enjoying a chilly stroll in the capital on Friday.

Wrapped up warmly against the biting wind, Pippa was elegant in a £225 Max Studio houndstooth jacket which she teamed with low-key jeans and over-the-knee brown suede boots in a classic Chelsea girl style.

She completed the look with a £475 burgundy leather and black calf hair Milan tote bag by Milli Millu - an up-and-coming label whose bags have also proved popular with the Made in Chelsea set.

While enjoying her wander, Pippa found time for a detour which took her into a shop called Chelsea Framers - perhaps in search of the perfect frame in which to hang photos of her new nephew Prince George?

During the christening on the 23rd October, Pippa joined her parents and members of the Royal Family, including the Queen and Prince Harry, to celebrate Prince George's welcome into the Church of England.

Never one to miss the chance to dress up, Pippa plumped for a typically elegant £750 Susannah Fashion cream coat.

Stylish: Since being catapulted to fame in 2011, Pippa has proved to be something of a fashion icon

More recently, Pippa was spotted enjoying a sailing expedition with Olympic gold medalist, Sir Ben Ainsley, on the seas off the Isle of Wight.

In spite of the blustery weather, Pippa managed to inject a sense of style into the occasion in a cosy blue fleece and practical brown suede boots.

Pippa's partiality to fashion has been well documented since she was propelled to fame at the 2011 Royal Wedding.

Since then, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister has had a bag named after her and is often spotted clutching her Modalu Pippa bag, although she's just as frequently seen carrying today's label Milli Millu.

Other favourites include Somerset-based designer Alice Temperley, the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite, Issa, and young American talent, Misha Nonoo.
