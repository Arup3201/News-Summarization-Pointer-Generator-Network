Asking a child to get off their computer or mobile can often lead to the dreaded iPaddy, as it is known.

But now, distressed parents may be able to avoid these tantrums with the launch of the first ever website 'timer'.

The timer has been rolled out on www.ticketytoc.com, a website of a popular kids' TV show, which went live today.

The feature, which is a first for a UK website, was incorporated into the site following demand from parents.

The first website 'timer' which limits children's computer screen time has been launched in the UK. Parents can set a limit which restricts the amount of time their children can spend on www.ticketytoc.com

It will allow parents to set a limit 
which restricts the amount of time their children can spend on the site 
from five to 30 minutes.

On average children spend nearly two hours a day on a computer, mobile or tablet.

It is estimated that around quarter spending much longer- around four hours a day- staring at the screen.

In a study of 2,000 parents, eight out
of ten who had children aged 14 or under said they now restrict their 
use of gadgets as their preferred method of punishment.

The timer provides a natural end to the game, which the creators claim will make children less inclined to throw tantrums- or 'iPaddys'- when parents decide to stop their device time.

The website stars the two main characters, Tommy and Tallulah, and allows the child to play with them as they race against time to complete challenges.

As the limit ends the characters thank the child for their help and let them know their session has expired on the site, before 'locking' access.

In order to override the timed-out session a question is generated for parents to answer which, when done correctly, allows them to reset the timer and the child to continue to play.

‘We know that kids are using mobiles and tablets more and more, and parents are often concerned about screen time,’ said Jennifer Lawlor, SVP consumer products at Zodiak Rights, the IP company behind Tickety Toc.

‘The 'Timer' feature on TicketyToc.com allows parents to have an element of control, and gets kids used to an automatic cut-off time, whilst still allowing them to have fun.'

A quarter of British households now own a tablet computer, with children becoming increasingly attached to the devices.

It is thought that on average children spend nearly two hours a day on their favourite gadgets, with more than a quarter spending four hours a day staring at the screen.

Research has also found that more than one in ten children under the age of four regularly used a tablet computer.

Although
half of parents admitted to buying their children digital devices, more
than 70 per cent were concerned their offspring had grown too attached 
to them.
