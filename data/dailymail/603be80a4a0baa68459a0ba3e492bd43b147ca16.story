Tens of thousands of mourners lined the streets of London today as the capital drew to a standstill for the funeral of Baroness Thatcher.

Pockets of onlookers broke into spontaneous applause, cheers 
and whistles of support that rang around the streets of London as the 
coffin passed them, drowning out the odd jeer from anti-Thatcher protesters. 

Some of the estimated 50,000 onlookers threw white roses in the path of the gun carriage that carried Lady Thatcher to St Paul's Cathedral.

Last night some of the Iron Lady's fans camped out overnight to make sure they secured a good vantage point to watch the cortege.

Clamber to see: Lady Thatcher, who died last week, was the first British female Prime Minister and served from 1979 to 1990

Gentle applause greeted Lady Thatcher as the hearse carrying her coffin arrived at St Clement Danes church.

It was the first activity of the 
funeral procession for the crowds who had stood waiting patiently for hours.

The words 'Oh beautiful' could be heard as the pristine gun carriage pulled in at 10.19am.

There was silence as the crowds, pinned back by barriers, waited for another glimpse of the coffin. 

When 
the gun carriage moved off in procession to St 
Paul’s Cathedral for the funeral service the applause came once again 
from the onlookers - only this time it was louder than before and came 
in a boom rather than a ripple.  

Alan Southern, 53, was joined by a 
smartly dressed band of colleagues from the Parachute Regiment in 
attending the funeral to show his respect.

Mr Southern, who fought in the 
Falklands War as a 23-year-old and met Lady Thatcher four times, said: 
'I have no interest at all in what the demonstrators say.

Closure: Although Thatcher fans camped out, teams of police arrived on The Strand at 7am and had closed the road to traffic by 8am

'When we came out for the Remembrance 
Parade they were all shouting. It’s the only day of the year anyone 
listens to them. They have to remember we fought for them to have the 
right to do it.

'Lady Thatcher was an absolutely 
wonderful lady. She loved the armed forces and she did so much for the 
country, she put the ‘great’ back in Great Britain.

Phil Moore, 43, said he had been 
waiting outside the cathedral since 9.30am to pay his final respects and
branded the smattering of protesters outside St Paul’s as 'despicable'.

'I know they’ve got the right to protest but doing so at a funeral is not particularly British,' he said.

'I think it’s a shame for the family 
of Margaret Thatcher. It must have been very upsetting for them even 
though they put on a brave face.'

Waiting in Whitehall were Brighton 
University students Rebecca May, 21, and Javiar Mansell, 20.

Ms May said: 'I feel people protesting should remember Lady Thatcher was a mother and a grandmother.'

Big turn out: The streets were packed at St Paul's Cathedral as service began

Ms Mansell said: 'I don’t think people
my age have the right to protest about her policies. 'We are here out 
of respect. Also, it’s a historic event.'

Joe Walker, 32, a Big Issue-seller 
from Canada, said he had moved from his usual Regent Street patch to The
Strand to take advantage of the increased footfall from the funeral 
procession.

'It seems like people love her and 
hate her here, and I can see why,' he said. 'It’s amazing that people 
can buy their own council houses in England, it’s my dream to own my own
house.

'But then I know some people who take advantage of it and sell them on for much higher prices, so no one can get a home.'

Looking on in Whitehall was Australian
mother-of-two Geraldine Fenn, 47.

'I remember Margaret Thatcher in a 
very positive light,' said Mrs Fenn, who is from Melbourne. 'I know 
there were difficulties over the miners but as I grew older I realised 
that Britain needed to change.'

Cindy Dooley, 61, and her husband Paul, 62, agreed. The couple came down from Manchester 
to pay their respects and were sitting in portable chairs near St Paul’s
Cathedral at 7.30am, drinking coffee as they waited for the procession.

'She achieved so much,' said Mrs Dooley. 'She put us back on the world stage.

'We were in our 20s then and nothing was being done, you just got fed up with it.

'Everybody was on strike, it was awful and we needed somebody to make hard decisions and she had the conviction to do it.

Trafalgar Square, the scene of 
protests in recent days, was calm this morning, with a few dozen 
spectators waiting for Lady Thatcher’s coffin to go past.

Student Charly Wright, 19, said she believed the fierce response to her death had been fuelled by social media.

'Young people are influenced by what 
they read on Twitter and it’s easy for them to get caught up in the hype
without really understanding anything about it,' she said.

Her friend, Joel Enfield, also 19, said: 'I’ve been more motivated to come here because of the reaction to her death.

'There’s been so much tension around it.

'Most of the young people against her 
don’t really have a clue about her time as leader, they’re just taking 
on their parents’ views and those around them.

'They forget she was re-elected twice
and ultimately was voted out by her own party. She had some incredible 
achievements but people only seem to remember the bad.'

Dozens gathered in Baroness Thatcher's home town to pay their final respects to the Iron Lady.

Roots: People of Grantham gather at the town's museum to watch Baroness Thatcher's funeral on a projector screen. The former Prime Minister was born and grew up in the Lincolnshire town

Tributes: Flowers were laid at the shop in North Parade which was Baroness Thatcher's birth place in Grantham, Lincolnshire

Many came together inside Grantham Museum to watch the funeral of the former prime minister broadcast live on a big screen.

There
was a sombre atmosphere at the museum, which is usually closed on 
Wednesdays but opened its doors specially for the funeral, as mourners 
silently watched the funeral procession as it made its way through the 
streets of London.

Christine Taylor travelled from Lincoln to be at the museum this morning.

Retired Mrs Taylor, 66, said she would have liked to have been on the streets of London to pay her respects but was happy to be in Baroness Thatcher's home town, where she was born and raised.

Mrs Taylor said she appreciated Baroness Thatcher's years in power had been divisive but she believed she was a wonderful prime minister.

'I think people forget the way Britain was before she came to power,' she said. 'They forget the winter of discontent.'

Earlier, a pink rose was unveiled at South Kesteven District Council headquarters in the town to mark the funeral.

The flower, from County Gardens Roses in Shropshire, was named Grantham’s Thatcher Rose by the council.

It will be replanted in Wyndham Park in the town at a later date.

There were no mass protests in the town and a statement from Lincolnshire Police said they had continued to “review intelligence' ahead of the funeral, but had not received any suggestion of any action.

The statement added: 'Appropriate contingency plans are in place and extra officers are available to be deployed, should this be necessary.'

Outside the home where Baroness Thatcher grew up above her father’s grocer’s shop, which is now a chiropractic clinic and holistic retreat, dozens of floral tributes had been left in her memory.

One card, signed by Johnny Ferry, read: “The Iron Lady. Thanks for everything.'

Another said: 'Margaret Thatcher, thank you and god bless for your life and service. From Lyndsey and a very grateful North Notts mining family.'
