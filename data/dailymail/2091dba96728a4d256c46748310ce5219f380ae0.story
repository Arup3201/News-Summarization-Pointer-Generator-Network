The heart-stopping moment a crazed gunman fired at a brave Pennsylvania State Trooper who had just rammed his pick-up truck to save a colleague's life has been caught on tape.

Trooper Timothy Strohmeyer has this week been named International Police Officer of the Year after he risked his life to stop shooter Jeffrey Lee Michael, who had just shot dead a woman preparing for a children's party in a Frankstown Township church and two other innocent people last Christmas.

A terrifying dash cam video, released today, shows Strohmeyer ram Michael's pick-up on December 21, 2012 to save a colleague who was trapped in his cruiser, and end the gunman's deadly rampage, then dodge a mass of bullets before shooting Michael dead.

An unemployed former trucker, Michael, 44, of Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, allegedly walked into the church and shot dead Kimberly A. Scott, 58, before shooting William Harrison Rhodes Jr., 38, and his father-in-law, Kenneth Lynn and then fleeing in his truck.

Brave: The heart-stopping moment Trooper Timothy Strohmeyer rammed Jeffrey Lee Michael's pick-up truck on December 21, 2012 and then was shot at by the crazed gunman, pictured left, was caught on dash cam video

Fleeing the scene in his truck, Michael fired shots into two police cruisers - one belonging to Strohmeyer and another to his colleague Trooper David Navaruk - that passed him in the opposite direction. Both cruisers quickly turned around and gave chase.

Meanwhile, trooper Kevin Campbell was approaching Michael from the opposite direction.

When he spotted the third cruiser, Michael 'accelerated his truck and intentionally rammed Corporal Campbell's patrol car head-on,' trapping the officer inside his own cruiser, according to the state police.

That's when Strohmeyer, who can be seen on the video, obtained by ABC News, approaching the collided cars, decided to ram his own cruiser into the back of Michael's truck hoping this would divert attention away from his trapped colleague.

Strohmeyer's plan worked. Michael can
be seen on video charging Strohmeyer's cruiser with his gun drawn and 
firing eight bullets into his windshield.

Strohmeyer was hit several times in the chest and left wrist, but was wearing a bulletproof vest so survived.

Michael was killed by the troopers' returning gunfire.

The
heroic act caught the attention of the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police and, 10 months after the incident, at its annual 
conference in Philadelphia, the group bestowed its highest honor on 
Strohmeyer.

Attorney General Eric Holder presented him with the award.

'His
courageous actions in the line of fire last December – when he placed 
his own life at great risk in order to save the lives of those around 
him – exemplified the very best of what it means to be a public 
servant,' Holder said.

'He is a hero in the truest sense of the word. 
And it's an honor to join the IACP in celebrating such a prestigious and
well-deserved (honor).'

The shooting
spree shocked the community as it came exactly one week after the Sandy
Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.

Michael's first victim was Scott, of Duncansville, who was decorating Juniata Valley Gospel Church 
in Frankstown Township for Christmas when shots rang out 
and bullets pierced through a window.

Michael entered the church and shot Scott, then fled in a truck, leaving another woman who was with her unharmed.

Michael then allegedly shot Rhodes and Lynn in the 
driveway of a home after a confrontation at a stop sign, one of the 
men's cousins, Marie Brenneman, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

'This person went to their driveway with a pistol, pointed at them and started shooting,' Brenneman said.

She said the shooter was a neighbor of Rhodes and Lynn.

'They were uneasy around him,' she said.

Rhodes' sister, Marie, mourned the loss of her brother on Facebook.

'Today
is the worst day of my life,' she wrote at the time. 'My brother and 
his 
father-in-law were shot and killed today by some psychopath. I hope 
(people) with mental problems really start getting help, so s**t like 
this stops happening.'

Victim William Rhodes worked at 
Grannas Brothers, a construction and contracting firm based in 
Hollidaysburg, according to his Facebook profile.

The gunman and the victims 
weren't related, 
Blair County District Attorney Rich Consiglio said.

'I
think we have three very fortunate 
state police members tonight,' Lt. Col. George Bivens, deputy state 
police commissioner said at the time. 'We are very thankful for 
the fact that they survived this attack. Someone was watching over 
them.'

Place of worship: The gunman stormed the Juniata Valley Gospel Church, pictured, in Frankstown Township

The woman at Juniata Valley Gospel 
Church had cooked food the day before for the funeral of the church's 
longtime pastor, said the Rev. James McCaulley, his brother.

The church 
was still reeling from the Rev. David McCaulley's death when the woman 
returned to decorate its hall - named after the pastor of 58 years - and
bullets ripped through a window, he said.

James McCaulley, who is the pastor of
another church about 50 miles away from the site of the carnage, 
said his older brother began leading the Frankstown church in 1954.

'He preached his last sermon at the church in October before he fell ill,' McCaulley said.

The church, which lists about 150 
members in an online want ad posted last December for an associate pastor, 
is close-knit, and the woman killed in the shooting was among its more active 
members, McCaulley said.

'The only thing I can say good at 
this time is that (the gunman) didn't do this 24 hours earlier when 
there was a big crowd in the church hall,' McCaulley said. 'We're 
devastated.'
