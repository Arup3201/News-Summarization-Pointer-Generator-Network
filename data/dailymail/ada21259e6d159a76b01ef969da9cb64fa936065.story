When the Duchess of Cambridge returned to Royal duties last week, she exuded her usual elegance as – six months pregnant – she positively glowed on her first public engagement for weeks.

But, as these exclusive pictures show, it was a very different-looking Kate who made an off-duty shopping trip earlier in the week.

With her hair scraped back into a ponytail, some strands of grey streaking her usually glossy locks, and appearing wan and pale, the Duchess – who has just celebrated her 33rd birthday – seemed out of sorts as she climbed awkwardly into her chauffeur-driven car, struggling with three shopping bags.

It is said the reason for her less glamorous look is that the pregnant Duchess has pared down her beauty regime for health reasons. Her spray tans and glossy, semi-permanent highlights have been ditched because of the chemicals they contain.

Ahead of last week’s visit to London’s Barlby primary school, where the Duchess and artist Grayson Perry opened a new centre for her charity, The Art Room, she booked an appointment to have a vegetable dye rinsed through her hair before having it blow-dried and styled.

The Duchess of Cambridge has become a fashion icon in her own right and one of our favourite things about her style is the fact she shops on the high-street!

She's often spotted wearing labels like LK Bennett, Hobbs, Reiss, Whistles and Topshop, with her latest high-street purchase being this gorgeous white coat from Zara.

There's something undeniably chic about white outerwear as this Zara design proves. Kate's worn it to do a spot of shopping, but it's smart enough to layer on top of an evening look too.

The great news is that the coat is now in the sale for just $79.99, so click right to snap it up while you can. Anything Kate steps out in becomes instantly iconic thanks to her style status, making it a wardrobe worthy piece to nab for your own collection.

As she stepped on to the pavement at the Ladbroke Grove school, it was clear all traces of grey had gone, although Kate’s locks had a stronger chestnut glow than her usual colour.

 Flashing her trademark smile, Kate, who is expecting her second baby in April, looked the picture of health. She also looked radiant on Friday when she attended a reception for the Fostering Network in Islington, North London.

The Duchess has spent the past few weeks on extended holiday at the new home she and William share at Anmer Hall in Norfolk. 

William is studying hard to qualify in his new job as an air ambulance pilot based at Cambridge Airport.

According to one source, it might not be too long before Kate’s next holiday. Next month she is hoping to join her family on the private Caribbean island of Mustique for her mother Carole’s 60th birthday. 

The Middletons are understood to have booked a villa there.

Says a source: ‘Kate is pencilled in for a trip to Mustique with Prince George. William is not going as he has his head down, revising for exams. 

'It is a big birthday for Carole and Kate won’t want to miss it. She has been saying she really is missing some winter sun.’

Kate has been given the all-clear to travel – and looks as though she deserves a break in the sun.
