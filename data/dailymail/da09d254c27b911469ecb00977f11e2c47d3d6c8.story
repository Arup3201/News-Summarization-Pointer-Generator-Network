Arsenal are in advanced negotiations about participating in next summer's Barclays Premier League Asia Trophy.

Sportsmail understands the tournament - which is held every two years - will be held in Singapore next summer, though the Premier League are yet to officially confirm the host nation.

And the Gunners are set to make their debut in the tournament as part of their pre-season preparations ahead of the 2015/16 season.

Talks regarding Arsenal taking part in the four-team pre-season tournament are believed to be at an advanced stage.

Taking part in the competition is likely to form part of a wider summer tour of Asia for the Gunners.

South-east Asia is a regular destination for the north London club during their pre-season preparations.

But owing to the World Cup, the club decided against a long summer tour earlier this year, instead opting for a four-day camp in New York City, USA.

Though, it now looks likely that the Gunners will return to Asia next summer.

The last Asia Trophy  was won by Manchester City in 2013, who beat Sunderland in the final in Hong Kong - Tottenham and South China rounded out the four-team tournament.
