Killed: James 'Terry' Watson was murdered by a gang of kidnappers in Bogota in Colombia

Six Colombians have been charged over the kidnap and murder of an American agent who was targeted in a 'millionaire's ride' sting in a taxi in Bogota.

James 'Terry' Watson, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, was apparently kidnapped by his taxi driver and a number of accomplices who believed he was wealthy.

According to an indictment from the U.S. Justice Department, he was attacked by a stun gun and then stabbed before escaping from the taxi.

Although Mr Watson, 42, managed to reach a hospital, he later died of his knife injuries following the incident on June 20.

Six suspects have now been indicted by a federal grand jury, charged with second-degree murder, kidnapping and conspiracy to kidnap.

The men charged are Gerardo Figueroa Sepulveda, Omar Fabian Valdes Gualtero, Edgar Javier Bello Murillo, Hector Leonardo Lopez, Julio Estiven Gracia Ramierez and Andr√©s Alvaro Oviedo-Garcia.

Wilson Daniel Peralta-Bocachica has also been charged with attempting to destroy evidence linked to the murder.

'With today's arrests, we take an important step towards ensuring that those allegedly responsible for his senseless murder are brought to justice,' Attorney General Eric Holder said.

The six men were members of a kidnap gang which targeted rich tourists in a scam known as the 'paseo millonario', or 'millionaire's ride', according to the indictment.

This sting was apparently triggered whenever a passenger thought to be particularly wealthy entered a taxi belonging to a conspirator.

Other criminals would then pull up in their vehicle and get in to the back seat of the first car alondside the victim.

They would threaten him with knives and other weapons, and force him to hand over cash, credit cards and other valuables.

Mr Watson was attacked in the upmarket 93 Park district of Bogota, where he was temporarily on duty while stationed in the city of Cartagena.

His murder is being investigated by the FBI, the DEA and the Diplomatic Security Service, with the help of Interpol and the Colombian police.

A few days after the killing, authorities in Colombia said they had arrested four gangsters who tried to sell seats from the taxi in which Mr Watson was kidnapped.

Investigators have insisted that the killing was the result of a random attack, and was not linked to the agent's work with the DEA.
