Athletic Bilbao have rejected Manchester United's £28.7million bid for Ander Herrera as their political posturing over his departure kicks in.

United are confident, having met Herrera's contracted buy-out clause on Tuesday, that the transfer will proceed and know that the player wants to join.

However, in similar fashion to the saga that surrounded Bayern Munich's purchase of Javi Martinez in August 2012, Bilbao have made it known to their supporters that they do not wish to accept Herrera's departure so readily.

The 24-year-old is regarded as one of Athletic's best players and the proud Basque club cannot lose face among its supporters.

The Spanish club put a short statement on their website on Thursday morning saying that the bid had been rejected.

It
 read: 'Athletic Club wishes to report that this week (it has) rejected 
an offer from Manchester United FC, estimated at 36 million euros, to 
transfer the economic rights of the player Ander Herrera.'

However, Herrera was at Carrington on Wednesday and fully intends to complete the transfer to Old Trafford.

Former club Real Zaragoza are due £1million sell-on fee as part of any deal, with Herrera's buyout clause rising to £32million on July 1.

Herrera, an intelligent and stylish midfielder, was the subject of a £24m offer from David Moyes’s United last summer.

At that time they did not believe it was worth paying the best part of £5m more to make the deal happen.

United
 denied problems trying to sign Herrera last year — namely when three 
lawyers turned up at La Liga headquarters in an attempt to push through 
the transfer without knowledge of either club.

Herrera
 has been watched by United for more than three years, with Sir Alex 
Ferguson’s brother Martin among the first to bring him to the club’s 
attention.

Despite shelving the signing last August, Moyes had promised Herrera he would monitor his progress. A dip in form followed but he recovered to help propel Bilbao to fourth place in La Liga.

Herrera, part of Spain’s Olympic squad at London 2012, was also a team-mate of United’s Juan Mata and David de Gea with Spain under-21s.

Van Gaal is already starting to put his mark on the squad, with Antonio Valencia and Patrice Evra both signing contract extensions.
