Is Saido Berahino the latest star on Manchester United's summer shopping list?

Louis van Gaal will embark upon a huge summer spending spree this summer as he looks to fire United back to the top of English and European football.

And West Bromwich Albion striker Berahino has got tongues wagging that he features on United's wishlist after attending the FA Cup clash against Arsenal.

The England Under 21 star has attracted interest from Premier League clubs Liverpool and Tottenham

The England international took his position at Old Trafford, next to representative Aidy Ward, for the quarter-final tie.

United, who look unlikely to keep Radamel Falcao when his loan spell expires at the end of the season, will look to bolster their forward line this summer.

Berahino has impressed this season, scoring 18 goals for the Baggies - as well as three for England Under 21s.

Liverpool and Tottenham have both shown an interest in Berahino this season.
