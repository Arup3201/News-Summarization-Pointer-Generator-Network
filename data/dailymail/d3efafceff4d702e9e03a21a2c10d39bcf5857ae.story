Jailed: Vicky Marks stole £4,200 from vulnerable Joan Groucher while pretending to care for her

A carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90-year-old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her PIN written in her diary.

Vicky Marks left her frail victim Joan Groucher 'heartbroken' by abusing her trust to plunder £4,200 from her bank account over a seven-month period.

The victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in Croydon, south London and move into sheltered accommodation. 

Marks, 59, visited Mrs Groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash, using the code written in the elderly woman's diary.

She even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital, Croydon Crown Court heard.

Sentencing Marks to 12 months in jail, Recorder Silas Reid told her: 'The victim was in her nineties, had problems with dementia, and, effectively, you inveigled your way into her family.'

He added: 'It's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age, why you would cause her that much pain, which, in the end, wasn't really for that much money.

'But time and time again you took her card and took money from her account. It seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money.'

Mrs Groucher, who has four children and eight grand-children, had lived at the same house for around 30 years, but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care.

'One of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home,' Mr Reid said.

In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Groucher said: 'I know Vicky does not have a mother, but that is no reason to do what she did.

'You were trusted by me and I'm heartbroken. It's disgusting what Vicky did to me. It worries me she could have done it to other people.'

Paul Fairley, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs Groucher paid Marks £10 every time she visited.

The thief's deception was found out when Mrs Groucher's daughter Caroline Baldwin, 70, saw that there was money missing from her bank account in July last year.

'She noticed there was £2,000, or £3,000 less than what there should have been,' Mr Fairley said.

Mrs Baldwin then took a closer look at her mother's bank statement and noticed 'a pattern of sums of £100 and £200 withdrawn over a significant period of time', he added.

She notified the police who checked CCTV footage from the Lloyd's Bank branch in Croydon and identified Marks withdrawing £100 from the victim's account the previous day.

Marks, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing.

Speaking outside court today, Mrs Baldwin said her family was 'elated' by the jail sentence, but added: 'It's had a detrimental effect on mum - she has deteriorated badly.

'Part of that is due to her age, but every time I see her she mentions it and says, "Why did she take it?" and "How could she do that?"

'When I told her about the sentence it was the first time I have seen her smile for a long time.'

Mrs Baldwin said she was 'disgusted' by Marks, whom her family had known for around five years, saying: 'If she had been handed a suspended sentence she would have done it again tomorrow.

'I think she has gotten away with it up until now, but we weren't going to let her get away with it.'
