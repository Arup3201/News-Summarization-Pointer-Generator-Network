The Obama administration official closest to the disastrous rollout of Healthcare.gov dodged questions from a congressional committee chairman – eight separate times – about how many Americans have signed up for coverage through government-run marketplaces.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner refused to provide hard numbers to House Ways and Means Committee chair Rep. Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, saying only that 'We'll have that information available until mid-November.'

That practiced phrase would come back time and time again.

Yet 'we have a system that's working,' she told dumbfounded House Republicans on the panel. 'It's just not working at the speed that we want and at the success rate that we want.'

Legacy in the balance: President Barack Obama has been left to white-knuckle it out, hoping that his deputies can persuade Americans to participate in the Obamacare system as key deadlines approach

Rep. Paul Ryan demanded answers Tuesday about how the Obamacare website verifies whether applicants are eligible for subsidies -- money they will be expected to pay back if the IRS later determines it was improperly awarded

CMS has promised a mid-November release of October enrollment totals. Tavenner said Tuesday only that 700,000 Americans nationwide have filled out applications for coverage, the first step toward enrollment.

'Then they go into the shopping experience where they can look at plans,' she said.

Tavenner also would not say how many of those 700,000 applicants were seeking Medicaid coverage, instead of a traditional medical insurance policy with paid premiums and out-of-pocket costs.

Some media reports have estimated that as many as 80 per cent are lower-income applicants signing up for Medicaid, a taxpayer-funded, poverty-targeted program whose upper income limits were expanded under the Affordable Care Act in states that choose to take advantage.

Tavenner also said Congress and the public won't know until mid-November how many applicants are actually hoping to enroll in insurance policies.

She said the same about statistics that would show how many young people have applied to participate.

Next up: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will be on the hot seat Wednesday when she faces congressional questions about the Obamacare rollout and what it means for health insurance consumers

The Obama administration needs approximately 7 million Americans enrolled in the Obamacare scheme in order to make its books balance. That includes 2.3 million young and healthy people, whose monthly premiums are required to fund the skyrocketing medical costs of the old and sick.

In the face of withering questions 
about the Obamacare website which is failing by every standard, Tavenner
 urged Americans to apply instead by mail, by phone, or through 'people 
in their communities.' That's a reference to the 'Navigator' program 
that has come under fire in some states for failing to background-check 
its participants.

Trouble: Tavenner told a congressional panel that Obamacare's website is 'fixable'

'I want to apologize to you that the website is not working as well as it should,' she said, while simultaneously insisting that 'there are more methods' for submitting applications 'than just the website, and that's important.'

The White House has focused on those other methods, including a phone line, paper applications and the Navigators, since the glitch-prone website itself became the subject of late-night comedians' jokes.

But the Navigators typically guide consumers through the website, and lack any other way to interface with the Obamacare system. The firms processing paper applications, too, enter their data into the website. And phone operators tell callers that when the website is down, they're powerless to help.

Ultimately, Tavenner insisted, 'this healthcare.gov site is fixable.'

Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady demanded to know why the website wasn't ready on time. 'You have had nearly four years to get it ready,' Brady sniped. 'Why should the American people believe you now?'

'My constituents are frightened,' he said. 'They are being forced out of health care plans they like. The clock is ticking. The federal website is broken. Their health care isn’t a "glitch."'

Camp was equally unimpressed. 'No amount of website fixes can make right the president's broken promises that health care costs will be lowered by $2,500,' he said, 'or that Americans will be able to keep the plan they have and like.'

Sen. Lamar Alexander demanded HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' resignation on Tuesday, saying that at least 1.5 million Americans are losing their health insurance because their policies are not legal under Obamacare

One contentious exchange between Tavenner and Wisconsin Republican rep. Paul Ryan highlighted what may be a loophole in the Obamacare website's application process.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp needled Tavenner over and over about the Obamacare system's enrollment success rates, but got the same rehearsed answer each time

Top brass at the IRS, Ryan said, have testified that they won't be able to confirm until 2016 whether consumers are eligible for health insurance subsidies in 2014.

The Obama administration's decision to delay for 1 year the so-called 'employer mandate' under the law has created a 12-month during which companies aren't required to provide information about which of their workers are covered by group insurance plans.

Also of particular interest are those under 26 years old who are covered by their parents' insurance policies, Ryan said.

Neither group is eligible for subsidies.

But it's unclear whether healthcare.gov is capable of verifying an applicant's 'yes' or no' statement about those scenarios.

'Are we really verifying at the front end whether a person is eligible for the subsidy or not?' he asked.

Tavenner pointed to 'help instructions' and reminders that applicants are filling out online forms 'under penalty of perjury.'

under the Affordable Care Act, Americans who wrongly receive subsidies will be charged for them when they submit a tax return that claims a refund, an outcome that Ryan called 'a rude awakening.'

Obamacare call center employees like these in Rhode Island depend on the healthcare.gov website to walk consumer through the Obamacare application process, rendering them less-than-helpful when the site is down

In the Senate, two key Republicans lashed out on Tuesday.

'It's getting harder to tell the Obamacare headlines from the Obamacare punchlines these days,' quipped Senate minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

'Paper applications, 800 numbers, applying by fax; Obamacare appears to be leading us boldly into the 1980s.'

And Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who is the GOP's ranking member on the Senate health committee, called openly for the resignation of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

'No private sector CEO would escape accountability after such a poor performance,' said Alexander. 'Expecting this secretary to be able to fix in a few weeks what she has not been able to fix during the last three and one half years is unrealistic. It is throwing good money after bad.'

The one-year delay of the employer mandate means the IRS won't know until 2016 whether people told the truth about 2014 subsidies
