They offer a shoulder to cry on and are always there to support us through life's ups and downs.

But according to a survey, one in ten people do not have a single friend to call their own, while a lonely one in five confess to rarely or never feeling loved.

Nearly half of those polled – 42 per cent – say they have no friends at work to make the nine-to-five routine more bearable.

A survey by the relationship charity Relate has found one in ten people do not have a single friend to call their own

Relate, the relationship charity which carried out the survey, said while the vast majority do have at least one close friend, it is 'concerning' that one in ten do not.

The poll of more than 5,000 people, which looked at all aspects of relationships, found that 91 per cent have at least one good friend.

It also revealed a clear gender difference between how close we feel to the friends we have – 81 per cent of women described the quality of their friendships as good or very good, compared to only 73 per cent of men.

Women also reported that their friendships improve with age, whereas men's remain the same throughout life.

Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of Relate, said: 'This new study examines the quality of our relationships, showing a clear link between our personal relationships and our well-being. Whilst there is much to celebrate, the results around how close we feel to others are very concerning.

'There is a significant minority of people who claim to have no close friends, or who never or rarely feel loved - something which is unimaginable to many of us.

'Relationships are the asset which can get us through good times and bad, and it is worrying to think that there are people who feel they have no-one they can turn to during life's challenges.

'We know that strong relationships are vital for both individuals and society as a whole, so investing in them is crucial.'

The survey found a quarter (24 per cent) of people are not satisfied with their sex lives, while more than one in three (35 per cent) think their bosses believe the most productive employees put work before family.

It also found that 85 per cent of people have good relationships with their partners, but while the vast majority of people in relationships feel close to their other halves, there are also some concerning statistics in this section, Relate said.

A total of 24 per cent of people report having an affair, and the counselling service said the numbers of people who rarely or never feel loved are 'worryingly high'.

The study found a clear link between high-quality relationships and high levels of well-being.

But simply being in a relationship does not guarantee that people will feel good about themselves - single people feel better about themselves than those in average, bad or very bad relationships, suggesting it is the quality of the relationship that has an impact on well-being and happiness, Relate said.
