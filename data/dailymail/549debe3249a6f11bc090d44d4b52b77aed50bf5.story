Keeper of culinary secrets: Nigel Brazier at the The Cook Shop with his cooked faggots - one of the recipes he will sell along with the store

For 125 years The Cook Shop has sold traditional cuisine to food-lovers in the small West Midlands town of Cradley Heath.

Much-loved traditional Black Country fare such as faggots, Groaty Dick and bread pudding - prepared using closely-guarded family recipes - have been sold there since 1889.

Now the owner has put the store on the market for £120,000 - complete with the secret recipes that have been passed down through four generations of his family.

Nigel Brazier, 64, is now selling up because he wants to retire and is including the answer to his family’s culinary mysteries in the asking price.

The grandfather-of-three is the fourth member of this family to run the deli since his great grandmother Eve Billingham founded the business from her front room during the 19th century.

Today Mr Brazier, who has worked at the shop for 49 years, said: 'We are an old-fashioned shop the likes of which hardly exist anymore.

'The business has been going 125 years but my sons have taken their own careers and are doing very well so are not really in a position to take it over.

'There are half a dozen recipes which have been handed down the generations. No-one else has been able to recreate them the same as us.

'They include our pastry recipe, and meats that have no preservatives, and our sage and onion stuffing.

'But the holy grail is the faggots we produce - a lot of butchers make faggots, but not like these.'

The shop specialises in selling traditional Black Country favourites such as chitlins - a variation on intestines - as well as black pudding and meat and potato pie.

Mr Brazier wants any prospective buyer to ensure the 125-year-old name will not disappear and keep the business up and running with their seven members of staff.

The family have built a famous reputation within the town but had always vowed to keep their recipes for their signature dishes a secret.

But he has promised to throw in half a dozen of them so the new owner can continue to make the perfect faggots and bread pudding.

Mr Brazier, who is retiring to spend more time at his home in nearby Clent, Worcestershire, with his librarian wife Anne, 62, added: 'Initially we didn’t have much interest but now there are people beginning to have a think.

'Instead of me leaving and closing the door, I want to leave it running in the hands of someone who is prepared to take it on.

'They must be keep the name and keep the secret recipes. It’s been an extremely emotional rollercoaster ride - it’s not a decision I came to easily.

'When it eventually came to doing it, I had to think long and hard. My sons wanted me to retire last year but I couldn’t because of our customer base.

'They are all our friends, 300 to 400 customers that we know on a personal basis. We share their lives, we listen to them, laugh and joke with them.'

Traditional fare: Fresh meats, baked goods and other foods on sale at the 125-year-old store

The much-loved shop owner started working there as a 16-year-old boy. It was originally passed from his great-gran Eve Billingham to her daughter Mary Priest and was then ran by Mr Brazier's mother Iris alongside his father Bill.

But because his four sons have all carved out careers of their own around the UK, this is the first time the family business is up for sale in 125 years.

He sells his famous faggots - which are usually made from pig offal and parts of the animal usually discarded, such as the heart and liver - for just 50p.

FAGGOTS

Traditionally faggots are made from offal, usually pork, and from animal parts that are usually discarded, such as the heart and liver. They are a cheap and nutritious dish and have enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence after falling out of favour for many years.

The West Midlands and parts of Wales are considered the home of faggots in Britain, but they are now eaten all over the UK. They are often served with peas, onion gravy and chips.

GROATY DICK

A beef and onion (or leek) stew thickened with oats. In the Black Country it is traditionally eaten on Bonfire Night.

CHITLINS

Chitlins are usually the small intestines of a pig, although the intestines of cattle and other animals are often called Chitlins too. Writer Thomas Hardy mentioned chitterlings in his novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles.BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING

A popular and refreshingly unpretentious pudding, popular throughout the UK, is made by layering slices of buttered bread scattered with raisins in an oven dish and then pouring over an egg and milk (or cream) mixture.

It is commonly seasoned with nutmeg and sometimes vanilla.

The secret dishes take pride of place behind the counter alongside the sausages and bacon, homemade pies and pastries, bread, cakes and tinned food.

Mr Brazier added: 'Lots of butchers make the mistake of throwing any cuts of meat in when making faggots, but there’s a real art to the perfect faggot.

'My mother Iris is 93 and still runs a critical eye over the faggots I produce. They are the finest you can find, we guarantee that.

'So prospective buyers will be getting much more than just a food shop.'
