A woman was photographed dragging away her blood spattered Staffordshire bull terrier - just moments after it beheaded a tiny family pet in a horrific attack.

The woman - whose arms were also smeared with blood - pulled off her animal and fled down a street in Warrington, Cheshire, after it ripped off the head of a Pomeranian dog.

As the Pomeranian's owner Gemma Antell, 30, looked on in horror, the bull terrier's mistress was alleged to have defiantly said: ‘It's not his fault - he's only a baby’, before strolling off with friends.

But a picture of the woman - showing blood over her left arm and on the dog’s paws - was taken by a passer-by and handed to mother-of-three Miss Antell, who posted it on Twitter and Facebook.

Cheshire Police today confirmed the bull terrier had been traced and confiscated - and said that inquiries were under way into whether the animal falls into the category of a banned breed.

The incident at 4:30pm on Saturday happened after Miss Antell had taken her dog Elvis to her mother in law’s home. She claimed the larger dog got into the front garden and attacked Elvis.

Two young children were said to be present at the time. In a message on Facebook which was posted before the bull terrier was found, Miss Antell said: ‘Right, local people. I need your help.

‘Our little dog Elvis was brutally killed by another dog. The dog literally ripped his head off. It ripped Elvis in half. It is my son's birthday and my kids are in tears and my whole family are traumatised.

'I have had to leave a family party and take our dead family pet to the vets in a bag to be cremated - it was beyond horrific'

‘I have had to leave a family party and take our dead family pet to the vets in a bag to be cremated - it was beyond horrific.

‘The worst part of this is the dog “owners” witnessed the attack and just walked off. She said: “It's not his fault, he's only a baby”. She's worse than the dog, because the dog doesn't know any better.

'It was on the lead the whole time. It dragged her in the garden she couldn't control it. Elvis was attacked in his own garden and he is the size of a rat.’

Chief Inspector Darren Hebden of Cheshire Police said extra patrols will be in the area to talk to concerned residents and address any issues.

'This was a horrendous attack and was clearly very distressing for the owners to witness'

He added: ‘This was a horrendous attack and was clearly very distressing for the owners to witness.

‘I am aware of pictures that have been circulated on social media which will undoubtedly cause concern for the community, but can I reassure people that we have now seized the offending dog so there is no risk to the general public.

‘We will be speaking to the owners in due course and will do all we can to deal with the incident appropriately within the guidelines of the law.’
