Harry Reid, the Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, apologized on Friday after video surfaced of him cracking two jokes about Asian-American stereotypes while speaking to the Asian Chamber of Commerce in Las Vegas.

'The Asian population is so productive,' the 74-year-old Nevada lawmaker said Thursday during his speech to a group of about 100 businessmen and women.

'I don't think you're smarter than anybody else, but you've convinced a lot of us you are.'

Later, when Dr. Terry Wong, the chamber of commerce's president, was introduced onstage, Reid grabbed the microphone and joked that 'one problem that I've had today is keeping my Wongs straight.'

Facepalm: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told an Asian audience that he had trouble 'keeping my Wongs straight'

Reid appeared before members of the Asian Chamber of Commerce during their monthly lunch at the Gold Coast casino-hotel in Las Vegas

Reid's apology came after a conservative political action committee called America Rising posted a video of the remarks on YouTube, titling it 'Harry Reid Mocks Asians, Gets His Wongs Confused.'

'My comments were in extremely poor taste and I apologize,' he said in a statement to reporters. 'Sometimes I say the wrong thing.'

The aging senator has a history of making off-color ethnic remarks that upset some groups, especially African-Americans.

In the 2010 book 'Game Change,' journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann quoted Reid commenting to confidantes that then-Senator Barack Obama would have a leg up in a presidential election since he had the benefit of a 'light-skinned' complexion.

And, Reid reportedly continued, Obama spoke 'with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.'

Reid's apology for that remark, delivered after the book's publication, was more of a deep bow. 'I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words,' he said. 'I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans for my improper comments.' 

'No negro dialect': Reid put his foot in his mouth during the 2008 campaign season, explaining why he though Barack Obama's race would help him win the presidency

The Las Vegas Review-Journal noted on Friday that Asian-Americans make up about 7.7 percent of Nevada’s population, a number twice what it was a decade ago.

The Breitbart.com website reported Friday that a spokesman for the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus – a group composed exclusively of Democrats – declined to criticize Reid.

The group's website says it will 'denounce' any 'racial and religious discrimination affecting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.' 

During the 2010 midterm campaign season, Reid told an audience comprised mainly of Hispanic voters that 'I don't know how anyone of Hispanic heritage could be a Republican.'

His office never blasted out an apology for that remark. 

He has been a U.S. senator since 1987 and a member of Congress since 1983. His next appointment with an re-election calendar will come in 2016.
