It was the most predictable and the most unpredictable of starts for Luis Suarez. He caused havoc in his first 45 mintues, creating a goal for Neymar and what should have been a goal for Messi but was the only one of Barcelona’s front there not to pick up an early booking.

Back from his four month ban for biting Georgio Chiellini the Uruguayan striker kept himself out of trouble in the first half but was a constant thorn in Pepe and Sergio Ramos’ side. 

It was his pass that set up Neymar for the first goal. Having started on the right he played in the Brazilian who still had plenty to do and did it well to give Barcelona the lead.

He held the ball up well with his back to goal and aside from one loose pass to Xavi his distribution was good. But Barça have bought him for his ability to unsettle opposition defenders and that is what he did throughout his first 45 minutes back in action.

Concerns had been aired pre-match that he would not be fit enough to play the biggest fixture in European football but at times in the first half it had appeared it was Pepe and Sergio Ramos who looked as if they had spent the last four months kicking their heels and not Suarez.

He should have had assist number two when he set up Messi with an even better cross from the right but the Argentine forward inexplicable failed to accept the gift. The game turned on that miss.

He went into one crunching challenge with Isco that left him hobbling for the next five minutes feeling his right knee but came out for the second half going down under another challenge this time from Luka Modric that earned Barça a free-kick on the edge of the area. Suarez is a fair way down the pecking order and Xavi wasted the kick much to the former Liverpool striker’s frustration.

Suarez was still full of running in the second half and released Neymar as Barcelona tried to hit back straight away. With a lung busting run he made it into the area for the return pass but the referee penalised him for a foul on Ramos as he lost and regained the ball from the Spain defender. It was one of those fouls that probably would not have been given in the Premier League and the reaction summed up that frustration throwing his arms up at referee Jesus Gil Manzano.

If Luis Enrique had decided to take Suarez off on the hour he changed his mind with his first 15 minutes of the second half. He should have been awarded a foul after Ramos pulled him back between the half way line and the penalty area. He grew increasingly frustrated as Madrid’s third goal went in. There were others who looked to have tired more in the second half but his number nine finally came up on 70 minutes. There had been no dream comeback but Barça fans disappointed at the heavy defeat can take much encouragement from the debut.
