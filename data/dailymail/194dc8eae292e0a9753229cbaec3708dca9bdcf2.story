Louis van Gaal is considering a stunning move to bring former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt to Manchester United.

The 33-year-old attacking workhorse has been playing for Fenerbahce since leaving Anfield in 2012.

Van Gaal loves Kuyt’s work ethic and he has been a low-key but high-end performer for Holland.

The Dutch side cruised into the last 16 in Brazil after victories over Spain, Chile and Australia.

Van Gaal’s men take on Mexico in Fortaleza on Sunday night and Kuyt warned there will be no let up of the attacking style that has seen them score 10 goals so far.

He said: ‘We’ve got Robin van Persie and Wesley Sneijder who is one of the best players in the world in my opinion. We know our strengths and we want to use those strengths.’

Kuyt was signed by Rafa Benitez for around £10million from Feyenoord in 2006.

He arrived at Anfield with a reputation as a goalscorer having found the net 83 times in his three years with the Rotterdam side.

Benitez converted him into a hardworking forward but the only major silverware he lifted was the League Cup in 2012.

He was in the Holland side who lost the 2010 World Cup final to Spain.
