A mother of two has told of her shock after her ‘weak bladder’ turned out to be a huge tumour.

Dawn Gilbert, 54, visited her doctor after she noticed she was needing to urinate up to ten times a day.

She believed she was suffering from a weak bladder but a shocking scan revealed she had a rugby ball-sized tumour in her bowel, bladder and womb.

Dawn Gilbert, 54, thought she had a weak bladder because she needed to urinate up to 10 times a day. However, a scan revealed a huge tumour was actually squashing her bladder

Mrs Gilbert, from Ilford, Greater London, said: ‘I was shocked to think I’d been carrying this monster around inside me. Doctors said they thought it had been growing for five years.’

Mrs Gilbert, who has a daughter, 27, and a 24-year-old son, says that when she reached her 50s she started to need to urinate more frequently and she wet herself when she coughed.

She put it down to an age-related weak bladder.

However, she finally went to see a doctor when a friend suggested a trekking trip where there would be no toilets.

Mrs Gilbert, who worked in her husband's chemist until her illness, said: ‘I thought it was just a sign I was getting old but it started to take over my life.

‘I love travelling but when a friend suggested a trekking trip and said there’d be no toilets, I panicked.’

Mrs Gilbert had a cancerous soft tissue tumour the size of a rugby ball in her bowel and womb

Her doctor referred her to a gynaecologist who believed she had a fibroid – a non-cancerous tumour in or around the womb.

However, a scan then revealed the horrifying truth.

Mrs Gilbert had a tumour the size of a rugby ball pushing on her bladder.

She told MailOnline: 'My husband and I were shocked when we saw the scan.

Leiomyosarcomas are cancers that develop in a type of muscle tissue called smooth muscle.

These muscles are found in the walls of muscular organs like the heart and the stomach.

They are rare and usually only affect people over the age of 50, but they can start anywhere in the body.

They most commonly start in the walls of the womb, the limbs and the digestive system.

People with early leiomyosarcoma often have no symptoms.

 symptoms to develop as the cancer advances include a lump or swelling, 
abdominal bloating, swelling or pain and a change in menstruation.

'We are intelligent people and we were shocked we could not have know I was walking around with that.

'I am frustrated with myself but I guess there was no way of knowing.'

The cancerous soft tissue tumour – called a leiomyosarcoma - was in her bowel, bladder and womb.

In December 2012 she an eight-hour operation at The Royal Marsden Hospital to remove the tumour and affected bowel and bladder tissue.

She also had to have a full hysterectomy.

After the surgery she also had six weeks of radiotherapy.

Mrs Gilbert is now cancer-free but has to have regular scans to check that the tumour has not reappeared.

She said: ‘I’m making the most of life. My husband David and I did the charity trek I’d always wanted to Machu Picchu.

‘I want to raise awareness of leiomyosarcoma. It’s rare but it does strike and I want people to check their symptoms before it’s too late.’
