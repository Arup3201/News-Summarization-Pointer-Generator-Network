Two convicted murderers were being hunted by police tonight after both went on the run from open prisons with fellow inmates in a bizarre coincidence over the weekend.

Daniel Shankly, 30, vanished from HMP Leyhill in south Gloucestershire on Saturday, while the following day 27-year-old Lewis Hoare walked out of Spring Hill Open Prison, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

Police were warning members of the public not to approach either of the men, who had both disappeared along with another inmate from their respective prisons.

Shankly, who was sentenced to life behind bars in 2001 for the murder of disabled Timothy Young, vanished alongside 29-year-old Daniel Wynne, although police said they may have split up since leaving the prison.  

Shankly, who has links to Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, is described as white, about 6ft 3ins and of slim build.

He has short brown spiky hair, is clean shaven and has a tattoo on his right upper arm with the words 'RIP Nan'.

Wynne, who was serving a two-year sentence for assault, has links to the Caerphilly area of South Wales.

He is described as white, 5ft 7in and of stocky build. He has a shaved head, speaks with a Welsh accent and has a tattoo on his left arm with the name 'Danny'.

An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: 'They were last seen at about 12.50pm and failed to appear for the 4.45pm roll call.

'It is believed they absconded together but it is possible they may have split up after they left HMP Leyhill.

'We would like members of the public who spot both or either of the men to contact us via the 999 emergency number.

'We would advise anyone spotting the men not to approach them but call us immediately.'

In a separate incident, police launched a manhunt for  Hoare - who was jailed for eight years in 2007 for the brutal murder of a former Royal Navy worker - after he left his low security complex with fellow inmate Kenneth Simmonds.

Hoare, 27, was part of a gang who kicked and punched pensioner Brian Kitching, aged 68, to death in a seafront rock garden after one of them falsely accused him of being paedophile.

Meanwhile, Simmonds, 43, was said to be in prison for malicious wounding.

Police were tonight warning the public not to make contact with the convicts, who walked out of Spring Hill at around 1pm yesterday.

Hoare was described slim, with blue eyes, short brown hair, clean shaven, with a mole on his right cheek, protruding ears and a tattoo with the word 'Pompy' across his knuckles.

Simmonds is of medium build, with blue eyes, short brown hair, clean shaven, with a small scar under his left eye, a scar above his right eyebrow, a tattoo of a panther on his left forearm and a tattoo of a panther's head on his right arm forearm.

Detective Inspector Joe Banfield from Thames Valley Police said: 'Thames Valley Police is working closely with the Prison Service to try and locate Hoare and Simmonds, who walked out of Spring Hill Open Prison at about 1pm yesterday.

'If any member of the public sees either Hoare or Simmonds do not approach them, instead call 999.'
