They were so brazen in their criminality that they posed for a picture as gangsters from the film Goodfellas.

The 15-strong gang spent years  dealing in cocaine and heroin, even using a boy of ten to push drugs on the streets.

Pose: Four members of the drugs gang, which made tens of thousands of pounds from selling cocaine and heroin, pose for a photograph entitled 'Goodfellas' (after the gangster film by Martin Scorcese)

But their efforts to copy the movie Mob 
ended when they were infiltrated by undercover police … and they were 
jailed for a total of 62 years.

Officers discovered the mocked-up ‘Goodfellas’ picture after raiding the home of one of the gang.

Dressed in sharp suits and staring menacingly into the camera, they were
attempting to ape the tough guys played by Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta 
and Joe Pesci in the 1990 Martin Scorsese film.

Gang: Aaron Dad 24, (left) received a three-and-a-half-year sentence for his role in the drugs gang, while Anthony Byfield (right), 30, was jailed for four-and-a-half years

Drugs: Shazan Qumar, 30, (left) was handed two years, eight months, for conspiracy to supply a controlled drug. Paul England (right), 30, received a 32-month sentence

But like the characters in the movie – who also ended up serving lengthy jail terms – the law was already onto them.

Nicholas Rowland, prosecuting at  Bristol Crown Court, said an 
undercover policeman, known as Amin, had built up a working relationship
with Yasir Mahmood and Ershane Hussain and was supplied with 
increasingly large amounts of cocaine.

The dealers later used a boy of ten on six occasions to supply police with heroin worth £64,000.

Sentenced: Waseem Hussain (left) was sentenced to five years, seven months in prison while Yasir Mahmood (right), 27, was jailed for two years and four months

Jailed: Craig Tamlyn (left), 31, was sentenced to three years in prison for his part in the drugs gang. Erion Qela (right) 25, was jailed for three-and-a-half years

Officers procured a further £41,000 worth of heroin in just one deal – 
and uniformed officers swooped just as Hussain was counting the money.

Bundles of cash, drugs and paraphernalia were seized from a number of properties belonging to the defendants in Bristol.

Detective Chief Inspector Richard Kelvey said: ‘This case should send a 
strong message to organised criminals that we are committed  to 
disrupting and ultimately destroying their networks.

Criminals: Tassadaf Hanif (left) 28, got five-and-a-half-years while Ershane Hussein (right) 25, was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years

Operation: Howard Blake  (left) 42, was given two years and seven months while Mubashar Aftab (right) 35, from Reading was sentenced to five years and three months

Tony Cross (left) 26, was jailed for two years, for conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, namely cocaine and heroin. Bradley Pearcey (right) 24, got two years in prison

Caught: Zuaur Ali, 28, was sentenced to six years for his part in the gang's operation

‘Illegal drugs destroy lives and communities and to involve a ten-year-old child in handling them is beyond comprehension.

‘All of these men pleaded guilty to their involvement in this conspiracy and have shown no remorse for their actions.

‘They are all professional criminals who have enjoyed life’s  luxuries 
paid for by their crimes with no regard for the damage that they cause. 

‘I hope the sentences will reassure communities that even though they 
may not see us, officers are working behind the scenes as well as 
overtly in the community to make people feel safe.’

The 15 drug dealers all pleaded guilty and were jailed after three 
separate court cases, but it is only now that the final batch have been 
caged that it can be reported.

On Thursday, Judge Julian  Lambert jailed Ershane Hussain, 25, for 
eight-and-a-half years, 22-year-old Waseem Hussain for five years and 
seven months, and Tony Cross, 26, was jailed for two years, for 
conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, namely cocaine and heroin.

Mahmood, 27, was earlier jailed for two years and four months for being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.
