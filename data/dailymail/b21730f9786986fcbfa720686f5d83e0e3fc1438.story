Buying the wrong bombs, mislaying anti-aircraft missile systems and gifting Germany a property portfolio have led the Ministry of Defence to rack up losses of £1.58 billion in the past two years, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Previously unseen accounts for 2012-13 show that the MoD has written off huge sums of taxpayers’ money after an array of stores losses, accounting errors and what are categorised in the department’s figures as ‘fruitless payments’.

The wastage came at a time when the Government was insisting that it needed to sack thousands of Service personnel to balance the books.

Figures obtained by this newspaper reveal that in the last financial year the MoD’s bookkeepers were apparently incapable of accounting for £33.6 million in funds allocated for military purposes.

A note in the accounts describes a lack of information over the whereabouts of the money – leading to the ‘write-off of unsupported balances’.

Documents also show that while the MoD was axeing historic regiments and withdrawing iconic ships and aircraft from service, it was simultaneously giving to Uzbekistan a fleet of 50 Leyland DAF four-ton trucks worth £450,000, and counter-terrorism training equipment to Pakistan worth £294,000.

According to the accounts, the  biggest giveaway of all in 2012-13 was handing back the barracks and buildings in Germany which had been in British possession. The documents state that this cost the MoD £1.5  billion in impairment charges.

The figures also reveal that hundreds of troops benefited from a clerical error in the wages department. They were overpaid about £640,000 and there are no plans to recover the excess payments.

Similarly the MoD has written off £527,000 for missing anti-aircraft missile parts, £743,000 after the disappearance of lightweight field generators, £390,000 for lost kit in Canada and £277,000 for purchasing bombs which no longer suited their training requirements.

Among the so-called ‘fruitless payments’ is £1.6 million for towing  HMS Astute after the submarine  ran aground off the Isle of Skye, and £393,000 paid to landowners  and catering contractors following  the late cancellation of military  exercises.

Defence sources stressed last night that such payments were inevitable given the requirement to change planning schedules due to unforeseen circumstances.

The MoD accounts also include a list of payments categorised as ‘claims waived or abandoned’. Among these is a £413,000 bill for security at a G8 summit, the £1.5 million overpayment of tax by the department to HM Revenue & Customs and £417,000 to settle a dispute over computer services at the Defence Academy in Swindon.  

Waste: Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy condemned the MoD's 'multi-million pound mistakes'

Last night, Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘This incompetent waste will come as a shock to a country angry at defence cuts.

‘Multi-million pound mistakes come at a time of mass sackings of service personnel and defence equipment being scrapped.

‘People will wonder how the Government can lose expensive items  of equipment. Ministers should minimise waste and prioritise protection for those who serve and their families.’

The MoD has also incurred several constructive losses over the last two financial years, though defence sources insist that these payments, such as the cancellation of the Nimrod MRA4 intelligence gathering aircraft at £3.7 billion, the early withdrawal of the Harrier aircraft at £1.2 billion and the retirement of five Royal Navy vessels at £513,000, will save money in the longer term.

The MoD said: ‘The figure of £1.5 billion in the accounts reflects the reduction in the value of the German estate as a result of the decision to withdraw UK forces from Germany earlier than planned. This is not the cost of returning personnel and their families by 2019, which will actually save the taxpayer £240 million per year.

‘The vast majority of write-offs are not items lost or wasted but occasions where we have sold off or scrapped redundant military equipment or gifted equipment to another country.

‘Gifting to countries often prevents the UK military having to get directly involved and thus saves the British taxpayer.

‘For the first time, the MoD has a balanced budget and the Armed Forces have a fully funded ten-year Equipment Plan of some £160 billion.’
