Police should face time limits on how long a person can languish on bail without being charged, the Home Secretary will say today.

Theresa May is demanding action amid mounting anger that police forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a legal limbo for ‘months or even years’ – only to be told they would not face any action.

The issue has been highlighted by a number of high-profile cases, including celebrities and journalists, who have been left on bail for long periods – often with strict curbs to their freedom – without charges being pressed.

Last week, the veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini, arrested in October last year by officers from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched in the wake of the late Sir Jimmy Savile being unmasked as a prolific paedophile, was informed he would not face sexual assault charges.

The DJ, who was investigated over historic allegations of molesting two teenage boys, told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ having his name dragged through the mud.

The College of Policing, the professional body that sets police standards, has expressed concern over suspects being repeatedly re-bailed as it appears to be being used as a ‘quasi-judicial punishment’.

The organisation has just concluded a review into how police and other law enforcement agencies use pre-charge bail in criminal investigations.

But in a speech to the College’s annual conference in Coventry, Mrs May will order it to consult on introducing time limits on how long a person can spend on bail.

Acknowledging it was a ‘sensitive area’, she said: ‘We must also look at statutory time limits on the use of pre-charge bail to prevent people spending months or even years on bail only for no charges to be brought.’

Mrs May declined to propose a possible time limit, but human rights group Liberty and the Law Society have suggested 28 days.

Police are allowed 24 hours to keep a suspect for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge.

In practice, they often quiz a person then release them on pre-charge bail to return for further interview at a later date, giving officers time to build robust cases.

But there are currently no restrictions on the length of time a person can spend on police bail which can force innocent people to put their lives on hold, pay thousands in legal fees and suffer the slow assassination of their characters.

Conditions can also be placed on police bail, which can include curfews and restrictions on movement and financial transactions while an investigation continues.

Comedian Jim Davidson lashed out at the system after being arrested under the Operation Yewtree and kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges.

Freddie Starr, another comedian, spent 19 months on bail after being arrested by police investigating decades-old sex allegations made by 14 women. The case was dropped.

Conservative MP Nigel Evans – who resigned as House of Commons deputy speaker before being cleared of sex assault charges in court in April – described the ‘indescribable torment, torture and stress’ of being left hanging on bail.

He was eventually acquitted by a court of all charges of sexually assaulting Parliamentary researchers.

Some 30 journalists are currently on bail – some for more than a year – while police investigate alleged crimes including phone hacking and paying public officials for stories.

A Freedom of Information request in May last year found more than 57,000 people were on police bail at the time with more than 3,000 bailed for more than six months.

Lord Macdonald, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, said recently: ‘There is sometimes a lack of urgency in police bail cases that is very worrying. Lives are put on hold and grave reputational damage goes unchecked, sometimes for years.’

Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, raised the issue during an evidence session with Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Referring to the 30 journalists on bail who do or did work for The Sun or now-defunct News of the World, he said: ‘They have been bailed and rebailed without being charged and have had their careers ruined because they have been suspended or lost their jobs.

‘It can’t be right that these people keep getting bailed and re-bailed.’
