Nine in ten people have no idea when well-known fruit and vegetables are in season, according to a poll.

Less than 10 per cent of those asked could name the seasonal months for home-grown produce such as plums, blackberries and asparagus.  

The survey by BBC Good Food Magazine found that just 4 per cent of people could correctly say when plums were in season and 5 per cent knew the three months blackberries were ripe for eating, while 10 per cent guessed correctly for gooseberries, and 9 per cent for outdoor rhubarb.

Less than one in 10 people know when some of the UK's most well-known fruit and vegetables are in season 

Even for one of the most popular seasonal fruits, strawberries, less than a quarter knew that they were in season in June, July and August.

The scores were just as low for vegetables, with only 7 per cent correctly naming that asparagus is in season in April, May and June. The best performance was for new potatoes, but only 13 per cent correctly named May, June and July as the key months.

The poll of more than 2,000 people found that 11 per cent could get the seasonal months for corn on the cob correct, and 12 per cent for pumpkins, but only 9 per cent could correctly name the months when broad beans were at their peak.

Despite the lack of knowledge, the vast majority of people thought it was important to shop seasonally, with 78 per cent claiming to look actively for food that is in season.

But only a third felt that supermarkets helped them to shop seasonally.

More than four fifths of those who tried to shop seasonally said they wanted to support British farmers, while almost three quarters wanted fresher produce and 70 per cent were keen for a better taste.

Of those who did not actively look for produce that was in season, almost half said it was because they wanted to eat their favourite food all year round, while 39 per cent admitted to being unaware of what the seasons for food were.

Gillian Carter, BBC Good Food Magazine editor, said: 'Cooking with the seasons has always given a delicious structure to the cook's calendar, but our survey shows this traditional rhythm is under threat.

'Although many of the respondents could hazard a guess, very few knew the exact months that produce was in season.

'The good news for British producers is that most people want to do more to specifically support them. The survey should be food for thought for supermarkets whose customers feel they are not helping them to shop seasonally.'

Writing in the September issue of BBC Good Food Magazine investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman said: 'The supermarkets' obsession with stocking every fruit and vegetable grown on the planet, every day of the year, makes it hard to detect the ebb and flow of seasonal produce.'

She said food seasons were also being blurred by changes to the weather.

But she said: 'Buying fruit and vegetables at their seasonal peak has always been the surest way to nose out the freshest, best-tasting, ripest produce, and that guiding principle is as relevant as it ever was.'
