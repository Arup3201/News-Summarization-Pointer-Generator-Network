When three-year-old Cain Trainor disappeared on his first day at nursery, his distraught mother Gemma feared the worst.

She dashed to the school to be met by tearful staff. Her panic grew, until a neighbour phoned to say Cain was safe – he was waiting for her on the doorstep after walking the one and a half miles home.

Incredibly, although he hardly knew the way, he had completed the 40-minute journey alone along nine streets, a cycle path and woodland, crossing a stream on what is known locally as the Devil’s Bridge route.

He had remembered to cross the road – with a group of children – where there was a lollipop lady and had even popped into a supermarket to check if his mother was there buying milk.

Mrs Trainor, 32, says she is not angry with her ‘lively little monkey’ and was reassured when he said he remembered her advice not to talk to strangers.

She described how she experienced the ‘worst moment of my life’ hours after leaving her son on his first day at the Little Owls playgroup in Middlesbrough. 

Cain went missing at 3.20pm as he and his class were being transferred from the nursery to the after-school session on the same site at Newham Bridge Primary School. 

He walked the route dubbed 'Devil's Bridge', which is made up of cycle paths, woods and roads he barely knew (pictured, he re-walks the route)

Three-year-old Cain disappeared at the end of the day as staff were taking him to the after-school club

Mrs Trainor, who works for a housing charity, said she had no reception on her phone at work. Once outside, she saw the school and Little Owls had tried several times to call her, so she rang them.

‘They started the conversation with something like, “I don’t want to worry you, but we seem to have lost Cain”,’ she said. ‘I felt sick – there aren’t words to describe that feeling of something terrible happening.’ She dashed to the school in ‘total panic’ and was met by distraught staff.

‘When I got there, they were all in tears. The headteacher came running over, saying they didn’t know what had happened.

Cain walked the 1.5 mile route through woodland and roads he barely knew from his nursery on Cayton Drive to his home in Saltersgill, Middlesbrough

‘Then within seconds, I got a phone call from my next-door neighbour saying Cain had arrived home. I burst into tears with relief. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I just kept thinking of what could have happened.’

Yesterday Cain explained his journey home, saying: ‘I walked past the lollipop lady and she went on to the road and stopped all the cars and then I went over the road and down an alley and came home.’

He was vaguely familiar with part of the route, having used it during summer bike rides with his father Ross, a maintenance engineer.

His mother says that she will continue to send him to the nursery despite the incident, which made her 'feel sick'

Little Owls playgroup has apologised and said it will be putting a tighter procedures in place and will work with Ofsted and Middlesbrough Council to ensure it has the 'best practices in place'

Mrs Trainor said: ‘As far as Cain was concerned he had done everything right and been very safe and responsible. 

'He didn’t realise that everyone around him was going frantic. In a funny way, I’m quite proud that he managed to find his way home.’

Cain will continue to attend Little Owls after his mother was reassured by its response to the drama, which unfolded a fortnight ago. Playgroup manager Kate Murphy said Cain’s family had been ‘understanding’. It is tightening its procedures.
