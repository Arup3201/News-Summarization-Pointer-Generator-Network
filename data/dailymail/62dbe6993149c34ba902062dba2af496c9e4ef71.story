North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been getting to grips with his latest toys - but the world can breathe a sigh of relief because there was not a nuclear weapon in sight.

The comparison between the dictator and a playground bully may have sprung to mind for those who watched the leader inspect a children's slide during his latest appearance.

The play equipment was manufactured by the Korean People's Army and was shown to the leader as he visited the country's military unit #1501 yesterday.

His visit came amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, which followed new U.N. sanctions imposed after the North carried out its third nuclear test in 
February.

Pyongyang has threatened to destroy the United States with 
nuclear weapons, bomb its Pacific bases and shell South Korea in 
response.

The North has also made multiple threats of an armed response to the South Korea and U.S. military drills close to its borders, which follow an artillery attack on a South Korean island in 2010.

But the leader departed from such rhetoric on his latest appearance, according to state news, KCNA, which reported that he 'repeatedly praised' troops for 'doing good things for children.'

Heightened tensions: The leader was reported as being 'greatly pleased' by the combat equipment

Homemade: The military equipment was reported as being 'contrived and manufactured' by the unit

Preoccupied: Independent observers say the country's army spends most of its time manufacturing

His military chiefs were also hoping to strike the right note with their by showing off musical instruments made by the country's 1.2 million strong army.

Accordions, drums, guitars and brass instruments were just some of the creations laid out on a table for the high-profiled visitor.

The Supreme Commander said it was important to make quality instruments so
soldiers could 'spend their worthwhile days in the army full of 
militant optimism and joy', KCNA said.

His father, Kim Jong Il, had been credited in North Korea claimed to have invented the oungum, a banjo-like instruments said to be popular in the country.

Kim Jong Un was also shown a painting of his grandfather Kim Il Sung - leader from 1948 until his death in 1994 - and inspected overcoats for children at top military schools Mangyongdae and Kang Pan Sok and suggested style improvements.

Plan of action: The visit came as South Korea and the U.S. signed a new military plan today

The leader also 'watched latest combat and technical equipment contrived and manufactured by the unit' and was reported by KCNA to be 'greatly pleased' by the development of the equipment 'badly needed for combat preparations'.

The agency added that he 'indicated superb and preeminent operational and tactical plans to wipe out the enemies at a lightning speed by use of those equipment in actual battles'.

But independent observers say the country's army, thought to be one of the largest in the world, spends most of its time manufacturing, fishing and farming, as the impoverished country struggles to feed its population.

South Korea and the U.S. today signed a new military plan of how the allies will communicate with each other and react to any future North Korean aggression.

Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the plan is designed to counter a future limited attack by the North, but details have not been released.
