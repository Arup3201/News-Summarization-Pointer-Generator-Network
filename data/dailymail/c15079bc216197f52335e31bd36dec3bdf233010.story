A key clue has linked pro-Moscow rebels to the truck seen carrying the BUK missile system towards Russia hours after MH17 was downed, it is claimed.

The owner of what is said to be the only such white Volvo truck in the Donetsk region of Ukraine has identified his lorry and said it was commandeered by separatists who took over his premises nine days before the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky, killing all 298 people on board.

Footage shot by a clandestine Ukrainian police team showed an image of a BUK weapons system on a Volvo truck being smuggled out of eastern Ukraine in the early hours of July 18, the day after the plane crash.

The owner of what is said to be the only such white Volvo truck in the Donetsk region of Ukraine has identified his lorry and said it was commandeered by separatists who took over his premises nine days before the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky

A Lithuanian news website revealed it has spoken to the truck's owner - identified only as Vasiliy - stressing: 'Western intelligence agencies have managed to establish the truck's origin and movements.'

Website alfa.lt said that Vasiliy - a 'new witness to this horrible crime' - now fears for his life.

It is believed he could identify the rebels who commandeered his premises and vehicles, a potentially key link in building a case against those responsible for downing the aircraft.

'The testimony of this person is exceptionally important -- it becomes undeniably clear that the anti-aircraft system that shot down the passenger plane was in the hands of the terrorists supported by the Kremlin,' stated the news agency.

Vasiliy said that on July 8 his truck was taken by rebels. 'Do not reveal my name -- I already have plenty of problems,' he said.

'My base in Donetsk was taken over and it was parked there. Yes, this is my vehicle. They came to our base and said they needed it.'

Members of a group of international experts inspect wreckage last week at the site where the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crashed

'Everyone left from the eighth (of July), and the base was under their control, including my equipment and that white truck.'

Asked if the truck was his - in the video footage at 4.50am on July 18 showing the BUK missile system being transported through Kransnodon towards Russia - he said: 'Yes, of course. It is easy to recognise. We know our vehicles. Yes, it is ours.'

He insisted it was 'the only one of its kind in the region of Donetsk. It is the only Volvo with such a cabin'.

Vasiliy did not specify for what work his 'base' was used.

Neither
 he nor his staff now work at the premises which are in rebel hands, he 
made clear. The website said it knows Vasiliy's full identity.

The footage is said by Ukrainian sources to show the BUK system being transported through Krasnodon.

Meanwhile, Russia is staging major new military exercises on Ukraine's frontier amid fresh fears in Kiev over an invasion.

More than 100 planes and helicopters will take part in the manoeuvres from Monday until Friday, said an air force spokesman, quoted by Interfax news agency.

The new Kremlin show of strength is certain to alarm Western leaders and comes after Kiev had warned of a significant swelling of military equipment and troops in Russian border regions.

Spokesman Igor Klimov said aircraft such as Su-27 and MiG-31 fighter jets, Russia's newest frontline bomber Su-34, and Mi-8, Mi-24 and Mi-28N helicopters would be used in the exercises and the aircraft would conduct missile practice.

The move comes as the Dutch and Australian experts are sifting through the wreckage of flight MH17 in tense conditions in rebel-held eastern Ukraine.

Its timing comes as many Western leaders go on holiday following today's ceremonies to mark the start of World War One.

More than 100 planes and helicopters will take part in the manoeuvres from Monday until Friday, said an air force spokesman, quoted by Interfax news agency

The aircraft will be testing 'aircraft weapons on land and air targets on new ranges, and will be conducting real and electronic launches of anti-aircraft missiles in Ashuluk (Astrakhan region in southern Russia) which is specifically designed to aide the coordination between aviation and anti-missile defence',  said the spokesman.

Ahead of the announcement, Ukraine had already warned that Russia has placed forces displaying the insignia of 'peacekeepers', with concerns expressed about an invasion of eastern regions.

A weekend demonstration was allowed in Moscow attended by up to 4,000 calling for Vladimir Putin to defy the West and send troops to rebel-held Donetsk and Lugansk.

Residents in both cities fear a siege as Ukraine's army closes in and Kiev defence minister Valeriy Heletey claims his forces will be victorious 'very soon'.

But Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council also say that Russia is building up its forces in border areas and even in neighbouring Belarus.

Kiev has long feared that if Russian troops invade from the east they will do so under the pretext of 'peacekeeping' while in fact annexing all or part of Donetsk and Lugansk regions.

Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council also say that Russia is building up its forces in border areas and even in neighbouring Belarus

'The Russians have been amassing their personnel and hardware near the Ukrainian-Russian border,' stated spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council, Andriy Lysenko.

'A brigade of helicopter units from the Russian armed forces was transferred into Belovsk and Sudzha districts in Kursk region.

'And 34 items of military armoured hardware bearing signs of a military peacekeeping contingent are deployed near the village of Belaya Berezka in Bryansk region.

'A Russian military train comprising 65 platforms with self-propelled mortars arrived at the Pawnochnaya railway station in Gomel, Belarus.'

Lysenko also alleged that ten more Russian tanks broke through the Ukrainian border and into rebel hands at the weekend.

'The tanks are moving towards Donetsk,' he said.

Russia has repeatedly denied Western claims that its military hardware is being put into separatist hands, and there was no independent verification of Lysenko's claims.

He also alleged rebels had barred an Australian police contingent from deploying drones at the site of the crashed Malaysia Airlines aircraft, amid fears they would provide proof of separatists using Russian weaponry in the area.

'The ban on using an UAV shows that the terrorists are not interested in a comprehensive and unbiased investigation. The use of an UAV would have made it possible to swiftly examine a large area, identify the site on the plan and find new evidence.

'It can also register areas where mines are laid and gunmen's positions are located.'

Ten civilians were killed in Donetsk region in the latest  clashes between rebels and government forces.
