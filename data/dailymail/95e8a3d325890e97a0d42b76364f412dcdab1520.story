Arrested: Aaron Chambers, 31, shouted for help when men armed with baseball bats smashed their way into his home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire

A 31-year-old man complained to police that his cannabis had been stolen - and found himself arrested for producing the drug, a court heard.

Aaron Chambers shouted for help when men armed with baseball bats smashed their way into his home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, after hearing about his drug-growing enterprise.

Police arrived on October 9 last year to find his class B drugs in the cellar and arrested him.

At a previous hearing, Chambers was branded ‘ridiculous’ by his own solicitor after shouting to police that his cannabis had been stolen. At his latest appearance, magistrates called him ‘daft’.

James Weekes, prosecuting, told Kirklees Magistrates' Court: ‘A member of the public called police saying there was a man shouting for police.

'When they arrived he was in the house and told officers someone had broken into his house and stolen his cannabis. There was a hydroponics growing room in the cellar with six fully grown plants and three smaller ones.’

Mr Weekes said the estimated yield of the drug was 524g, with a potential street value of £4,400.

Chambers, now of Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, admitted a charge of producing the drug. He said he had bought some equipment from a shop on an industrial estate in Slaithwaite.

Mr Weekes said: ‘He found out how to grow the drug by word of mouth and by the internet. Google is a remarkable thing. He said “I just enjoy it and I don't have an addiction”.’

Chambers received a similar conviction in 2002 for possession of cannabis, magistrates heard.

Mike Sisson-Pell, defending, described his client as ‘naive’ in growing the drug himself.

He said: ‘His naivety extends to the fact that he didn't anticipate that people of a more serious criminal nature would find out about his small growing and attempt to steal it.

‘It was with considerable shock and fear 
he found his address attended by four men trying to smash their way in 
armed with baseball bats.

'What you've done has been daft'

Barry Bedford, Chairman of the bench

'He was in fear that unless he acceded to their demands he would be subjected to a severe beating’.

Chairman of the bench Barry Bedford told Chambers: ‘What you've done has been daft.’

He ordered him to complete three months of drug rehabilitation as part of a community order. The seized cannabis will be destroyed and Chambers must pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
