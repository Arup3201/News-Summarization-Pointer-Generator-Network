Four of Europe’s most cash-strapped countries are set to pull out of the Eurovision song contest - in case they win and have to host the lavish event the next year.

Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Poland have all said they are ‘very unlikely’ to take part in the cheesy singing contest that has become a European institution.

The Greeks also said they could barely afford this year’s £100,000 fee to enter an act, and that ‘sequins and stage effects’ were distasteful at a time of austerity.

An official at Greece’s state-owned 
television network said: 'It’s not just that we don’t have the money to 
pay to enter, at this point it would be morally wrong.

'And winning it would incur a huge expense for our country next year.'

The cost of staging Eurovision is put at around £60million.

Cyprus
state broadcaster PIK said entering the contest would be ‘provocative’ 
when it was imposing drastic belt-tightening measures on its population.

Portugal and Poland also cited ‘financial reasons’ over the cost of entering and possibly having to host the event, due to take place in Swedish capital Malmo in May next year.

Poland, which also pulled out last year, issued a statement saying: 'After a very careful analysis we made the difficult decision not to take part.

The countries between them have garnered just one victory - Greece in 2005, when Helena Paparizou's 'My Number One' came out on top.

Greece first entered the competition in 1974, while Cyprus joined the fray 7 years later.

Of the four Portugal is the longest-running having entered every years since 1964.

Poland is the relative newcomer, having seen its first entrant in 1994.

The rush of nations pulling out comes after Spain’s entrant for the 2012 contest was urged to sing badly and not to win, to avoid any risk of having stage the competition in 2013.

Bosses of Spanish public television told pop star Pastor Soler ‘to throw’ her entry amid massive government spending to reduce the huge national debt.

The 33-year-old singer said directors of state-run broadcaster TVE called her in to say: 'Please don’t win. We don’t want to pay for it in 2013.'

She added: 'I can understand why they asked. The money would be better spent paying ordinary people’s wages.'

The Eurovision Song Contest - an annual competition organised by member countries of the European Broadcasting Union - has take place 57 times since it's debut in 1956, with Switzerland winning the inaugural tournament.

There have actually been 60 winners after a four-way tie in 1969, with 26 different countries having won the contest.The UK has claimed victory four times.

The most victories for a single country is seven by Ireland, with two of those - in 1980 and 1987 - performed by Johnny Logan, making him the only person to have won more than once as performer.

Portugal is the country with the longest history in the contest without a
win - it made its forty-sixth appearance at the 2012 contest.

No joy: Portugal is the country with the longest history in the contest without a win with entrants such as Sofia singing 'Foi Magia' in 2004 failing to make the grade

The voting techniques have evolved throughout the years but central to them has been the calling on of the points by a representative from each country.

While Eurovision provides a unique opportunity for winning artists to capitalise on their success, relatively few have actually gone on to stardom.

The most notable exception to this was Abba who won the 1974 contest for Sweden with their song Waterloo and went on to be one of the most successful bands of its time.

Another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame was Céline Dion, who won the 1988 contest for Switzerland with the song Ne partez pas sans moi.
