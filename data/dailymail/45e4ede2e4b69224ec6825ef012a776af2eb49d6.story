Robert Knott, 33, was jailed for a second time today for shooting student Kevin Bond, 30, with a sawn-off shotgun in front of his fiancee

A killer who shot a man dead in front of his fiancee as the couple drove to a wedding fair was jailed for life today after facing trial for a second time.

Robert Knott, 33, shot student Kevin Bond, 30, in broad daylight with a sawn-off shot gun in September 2010.

As the killer fled the scene, Mr Bond staggered back to his bride-to-be Natasha Haukedahl. He was then taken to hospital and sadly died later that day.

Knott, who had been involved in a long-running feud with the victim, then went into hiding. He eventually turned himself in to police a month later.

In April 2011, Knott, was found guilty of murder - but last September his conviction was quashed. He was ordered to face a retrial after his original barrister mistakenly suggested left-handed Mr Bond was right handed.

But today the killer from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was convicted for murder again - and was ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years.

Prosecutor Gordon Cole QC said the killing occurred as the couple made their way to a wedding fair on September 19 2010.

The couple had stopped at a BP Petrol station on Rowlandsway in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, just before 2pm. It was there Knott  - who was leaving the garage at the time - spotted the couple, the court was told.

Knott then parked-up down the road and waited for the pair to leave before following them.

The victim, who was travelling in the passenger seat, realised they were being followed. When the cars stopped at some traffic lights, he got out to confront the driver.

Within seconds of reaching the car, Mr Bond was shot in the abdomen by Knott.

Mr Bond was driving to a wedding fair when Knott struck. The killer shot the student in the stomach with a shotgun after following the couple, a court was told

Giving evidence, fiancee Miss Haukedahl,
 now 29, told the court, 'I remember seeing a gun coming up out of the 
window. I turned to look at Kevin and he stumbled back.

'He told me he 
was dying. I was just in bits.'

She
 told the court she began to drive towards the nearest hospital - but 
managed to flag down an oncoming ambulance by pulling into its path.

Mr Bond died hours later. A post-mortem concluded he had died from a shotgun wound to the abdomen and indicated he had been shot from between three and five metres away.

Knott was named as the shooter by witnesses - but when police went to his home he had disappeared.

He turned himself on October 22. He later admitted he had bought a shotgun for £300 from a criminal contact in the days leading up to the killing.

He denied he had been lying in wait for the victim and said he had not meant to kill him.

He claimed to have been a former friend of Mr Bond - but said they had fallen out in 2008 and he had bought the gun as he felt intimidated by the victim.

Knott claimed Mr Bond had pulled a gun on him, causing him to fire his own weapon. This was never proved.

In a statement at the time of Knott’s original conviction the victim's mother, Jackie Bond said: 'Kevin’s tragic death has had a huge effect on myself and my family, as we were all very close.

'No mother should have to bury her child and I am still struggling to come to terms with his senseless death.

'It has left a perpetual void in all our lives which can never be filled and the grief made worse for every single one of us because we have had to endure the painful and demonstrated series of lies that Robert Knott has been allowed to present.

'I am so sad and angry that Kevin was taken from us, so shockingly.

'My son was the victim of a horrific crime and wasn’t able to defend himself yet he was portrayed as the aggressor by Knott in order to justify his own callous actions on that fateful day in September.

'I feel as though my son and my family have been on trial these past weeks and not Robert Knott.

'Kevin was devoted to his family and friends; it hurts so much that his daughter will grow up without her father who was so very proud of her.

'He absolutely adored his daughter and his two younger sisters.

'Natasha the love of his life will always be part of our family and it has given me immense comfort that Kevin had found true happiness with her. Kevin had so much to live for and we as a family, looked forward to sharing it with him.'

The Wythenshawe, Manchester, garage where Mr Bond was shot dead by Knott - who will serve 30 years

Knott will now serve a minimum of 30 years.

 After
 the case Det Supt Bob Tongue from the Greater Manchester Police Major 
Incident Team said: 'Knott was found guilty once and we are pleased to 
see he has been found guilty again.

'I
 hope that the sentencing today will go some way towards helping Kevin’s
 family get over what happened, however, it will never fill that void 
left in their lives.'
