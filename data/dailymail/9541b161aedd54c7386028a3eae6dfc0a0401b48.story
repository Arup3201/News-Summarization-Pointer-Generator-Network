With exposed oak beams, a brick fireplace and views across rolling countryside, this is Maria Miller’s stunning new home.

It cost her £1.2million - almost exactly the profit she made selling a property funded by taxpayers.

The embattled Culture Secretary swapped contracts on the sprawling barn conversation earlier this year as the expenses watchdog probed her claims.

She is facing calls to quit over her false expenses claims, and has already had to pay back thousands of pounds and apologise to the House of Commons.

Dream home: Maria Miller's new £1.2million converted Tudor barn in Hampshire

But her latest property has only now come to light.

Mrs
 Miller made taxpayers fund some of the mortgage payments on her London 
property, then sold it and used the whopping profit to buy this 
‘charming’ Tudor house in Hampshire.

It boasts five bedrooms, a spectacular vaulted gallery and its own woodland set in more than an acre of land.

According
 to Savills, the upmarket estate agent that handled the sale, the 
reclaimed oak barn offers ‘a comfortable and convenient open plan family
 home of substantial character and charm’.

The
 sitting room features a cast iron wood-burning stove, and a ‘rustic oak
 bannister staircase’ leads up to the en-suite master bedroom and a 
library.

Outside, set in a 
garden with sweeping lawns, there is an annex barn with its own bedroom 
and a living room, and an historic Grade-II ‘cart shed’ for parking up 
to three cars.

A summer house and a capped brick well complete the idyllic setting.

Land
 Registry files show Mrs Miller, 50, bought the property on Valentine’s 
Day this year with her husband Iain, 51, a partner in a City law firm.

At the time, the inquiry was still going on into her expenses claims.

The minister’s complicated - and taxpayer-assisted - journey up the property ladder started in 1996.

In
 January of that year, she and her husband bought a smart double-fronted
 Victorian terrace house in Wimbledon, south-west London, for £234,000.

At the time, she worked in advertising and was not an MP.

In 2005, she became MP for Basingstoke and began renting a property in the constituency.

But
 instead of designating that as her ‘second home’, she told 
Parliamentary authorities the Hampshire rental property was her ‘main 
home’.

This allowed her to 
claim expenses on the Wimbledon property as her ‘second home’, even 
though the mother-of-three and her family lived in it.

The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner has since ruled that this was the wrong way round.

At the time, their mortgage had been increased to £525,000 - well over twice the amount they paid for the Wimbledon house.

Taxpayers helped her fund the mortgage payments.

Between 2005 and 2009, Mrs Miller claimed £90,718 in expenses for the property - close to the maximum permitted.

In 2007, she increased the mortgage again, to £575,000. Again, taxpayers helped to meet the mortgage demands.

After
 the 2009 expenses scandal, Mrs Miller flipped the designation of her 
properties to make the Wimbledon house her ‘main home’.

And in February of this year, she sold it. A buyer paid £1.47million, a profit of £1,236,000.

At the same time, she spent £1.2million buying the luxury retreat in Hampshire.

The
 Hampshire house, on which she has a mortgage with the Royal Bank of 
Scotland for an unspecified amount, is situated in one of the most 
sought-after corners of England.

Positioned
 in a tranquil village mentioned in the Doomsday Book, it is close to 
historic towns and top schools Bedales, Winchester College and St 
Swithun’s School for Girls.

A sweeping gravel drive leads visitors to the main house, but yesterday there was no answer at the door.

The
 property is a one-hour train journey to central London, but it is 
understood Mrs Miller is also renting a small flat in the capital.
