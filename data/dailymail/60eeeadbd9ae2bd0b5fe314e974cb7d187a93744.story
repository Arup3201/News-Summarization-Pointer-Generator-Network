A legendary Philadelphia High School football coach died in a multi-vehicle accident in Pennsylvania on Friday night outside a match his son was coaching.

Charles 'Bud' Hollenbach, 89, of Sellersville, was riding in a 2012 Ford Fusion driven by his wife, 84-year-old Margaret Hollenbach, as they were exiting the parking lot at Central Bucks South High School in Warrington.

Hollenbach - was inducted into the Pennridge-Quakertown Area Athletic Hall of Fame a few years ago - was there to support his son, Jeff Hollenbach, who is the current Pennridge football coach.

However Mrs Hollenbach somehow lost control of the car around 9.30pm at the rear of the carpark.

Charles 'Bud' Hollenbach, 89, was driving out of the parking lot at Central Bucks South High School in Warrington, Pennsylvania (pictured), when his wife suddenly crashed into three parked cars

Their vehcile struck three parked cars, one of which was unoccupied.

The initial collision led to the chain reaction that caused two additional cars to be struck, police told The Intelligencer.

Five people, including Hollenbach and his wife, had to be transported to hospital.

On Saturday, Hollenbach died from the injuries he sustained in the crash.

Hollenbach was a teacher at Pennridge High School from 1952 to 1985 and part of the football team’s coaching staff for 25 years.

He was inducted into the Pennridge-Quakertown Area Athletic Hall of Fame in 2012.

Pennridge played the Titans on Friday night. 

Police are still investigating the accident.
