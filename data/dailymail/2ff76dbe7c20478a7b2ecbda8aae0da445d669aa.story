Amanda Jones, 71, lost her 33-year-old daughter, Rebecca James, to breast cancer 11 years ago.

Since then Mrs Jones has been tirelessly campaigning to raise awareness of the disease.

She regularly visits prisons and other women’s institutions to educate people about the signs of breast cancer.

Mrs Jones, from Camberley, in Surrey, has also raised more than £200,000 for Breakthrough Breast Cancer.

Now, as Mothers’ Day approaches, the retired radiographer pays tribute to her daughter.

‘Happy Mummy's Day! This is my best card of a horse EVER for you!’ Small, round, auburn haired,  little red wellies on her feet and my riding hat jammed on her head, my youngest child, Rebecca - Becs - competed noisily with her elder sister and brother in the giving of cards and receiving of cuddles.

It would be the same picture being enacted all over the country on that special day - and every Mother’s Day since - precious memories of love and laughter.

Becs was born, two weeks late, on June 7, 1969.

I'd spent some time in hospital during the pregnancy, due to a threatened miscarriage, so she arrived with determination to get on with life, against the odds.

And that's how her character continued to develop - always holding her own with her siblings, Camilla and Dominic, while they made a formidable, loyal and loving trio.

She made her way through nursery, primary and secondary schools, making great friends while not overdoing the academic side of life!

Mrs James found a lump in her breast when she was just 32 and was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had surgery to remove the lump as well as chemotherapy but the cancer returned and spread to her liver

She played first the violin, and then the French horn. She was in the school orchestra and she indulged the dramatic side of her nature in the annual musical - she was always an entertainer, fun-loving, outgoing and simply so loving.

Rather reluctantly, she went off to college, in the same city where Camilla and Dominic were studying, and it was much later that I heard about the rescues of Becs that the two of them had carried out, retrieving her from less than salubrious situations and returning her to her rooms. Her social life definitely took precedence over her studies!

After a year at college, she went off to
 France to spend the summer working for Canvas Holidays and there the 
course of her life changed.

She went to a camp site outside Nice for the season, with the intention of returning in October.

But, as the date approached, she spoke more and more about the son of the campsite owners, with whom she'd been working all summer.

And that was how, at 19, she found her soul mate, Christian, and France became her home.

We, the family, spent so much time with them throughout the years - weeks of such joy, in the sunshine of the south of France, where her auburn hair turned golden and she became our Rayon de Soleil, our Golden Girl.

Just after her 32nd birthday, she rang to say she'd found a lump in her breast and was having it removed the next day.

Christian phoned, so distressed, from the hospital to say it was cancer and we went over at once to be with them both.

When I look back on that fateful call now, I remember all the hope and optimism and determination they both showed, giving us the example we so needed.

Becs received the very best treatment from that day on from specialists who would never give up THEIR hope for her.

During her first course of chemotherapy, a further lump was found in her breast and then she had a mastectomy, something that the surgeons had hoped not to have to perform on someone so young and so beautiful.

Since her daughter's death, Mrs Jones has campaigned to raise awareness of the signs of breast cancer. She is pictured (left) with her children - Camilla (centre), Rebecca (second from right) and Dominic (right) - and her daughter-in-law, Joanna

Mrs Jones said: 'I saw my darling daughter draw on reserves of courage and strength that, to us, were superhuman.' Her children (including Rebecca, right) are pictured the last time Rebecca was able to go outside

On New Year's Eve, 2002, we were all in the mountains above Nice, Becs with no hair, dancing on the table and so full of joie de vivre, so full of courage and optimism.

In March of 2003, it was found that Becs had developed secondaries in her liver.

From then on, I saw my darling daughter draw on reserves of courage and strength that, to us, were superhuman.

She never stopped thinking of others, even when so exhausted.

The love that she and Christian had for each other, 14 years after they first met, had such an effect on us all through those last few weeks.

On May 27, 2003, just eleven months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and at the age of 33, Becs died peacefully, with Christian and all the family beside her.

It was such a privilege to be with her at that moment.

Mrs Jones (pictured with her three children) wrote: 'I know that she is with us all forever, inspiring US to live life to the full and giving us HER courage when we tire and HER laughter when tears are too close'

As I had brought her into the world, so I was with her as she left her all too short life, leaving me with the gift of unconditional love that she gave me and the inspiration of her courage.

She left so much undying love for her sister and brother and, for us all, the memories of her living life to the full, from the moment she and I shared her birth through her years with us, so full of love, fun and laughter.

I miss her desperately every single day, I hear her voice saying ‘Hi, it's me’ on the phone, I see her swimming with Christian in the warm Mediterranean waters and I know that she is with us all forever, inspiring US to live life to the full and giving us HER courage when we tire and HER laughter when tears are too close.

On Mother’s Day, I shall think, as always, how endlessly blessed I am to have three deeply loved, amazing, supportive children, even though the youngest of them is now just out of reach, ‘just down the road’, as Becs used to say, but whose presence fills my heart every moment.
