Have you ever wondered what all those thoughts look like as they race around in your brain?

Now you can find out using a new system that peers into the storm of activity in real-time.

The technology, dubbed ‘Glass Brain’, was developed by neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley and Philip Rosedale, the creator of Second Life.

Scroll down for video... 

It combines virtual reality, brain scanning and brain recording allowing the user to journey through their mind.

The technology was recently unveiled at Austin's South by Southwest festival where the public were given the chance to look into the mind of Mr Rosedale's wife Yvette.

Mrs Rosedale was wearing a cap covered with electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes that measure differences in electric potential to record brain activity. 

The structure of the brain is mapped using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The user then wears cap covered with electrodes that measure differences in 
electric potential to record brain activity.

This activity is revealed on screen. The different colours represent the 
different frequencies of electrical energy in the brain, as well as the 
paths by which that energy moves around.

The Glass Brain can’t be used to show exactly what the user is thinking, but can paint a broad picture of brain activity.

Prior to this, scientists had mapped Mrs Rosedale’s brain structure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The Glass Brain can’t be used to show exactly what the user is thinking, but can paint a broad picture of brain activity.

A video of the brain recording was captured by the Neuroscape Lab at the University of California in San Francisco.

The different colours represent the different frequencies of electrical energy in the brain, as well as the paths by which that energy moves around. The white areas are anatomical fibres.

The technology could be used to help people with brain injuries make a faster recovery.

‘We've never been able to step inside the structures [of the brain] and see it in this way,’ Dr Gazzaley told Live Science. ‘It's biofeedback on the next level.’

Mr Philip Rosedale told LiveScience he foresees a day when two people could interact virtually in a way that reveals their inner state.
