Rapid response: Bus driver Mr Cork immediately sprung into action when he heard his son needed emergency treatment

A quick-thinking bus driver rushed his epileptic son to hospital in his double-decker bus after he started having a fit.

Ross Cork, 27, was forced to carry out the mercy dash for his two-year-old son Riley after an ambulance was delayed.

The Norwich bus driver had just dropped off all his passengers at 10.30am on Saturday at Castle Meadow in the city centre when he got a heart-stopping call from his frantic wife Lydia, who told him their son was having a fit.

Their vulnerable son, who has battled epilepsy since he was born, was at his grandad's home nearby and urgently needed to go to hospital.

Mr Cork instinctively phoned his boss at Konectbus to get the all clear to rescue his son and within minutes had diverted his bus to get Riley.

He said: 'I drove that bus down some roads I didn't think I would ever drive down - I still can't believe I did it.

'I keep thinking how lucky it was that I was in the city centre when I got the call.

'I could have been anywhere in Norfolk, but it just so happened I was five minutes away.'

Mrs Cork had dialled 999 and the bus driver arrived to find an East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) rapid response vehicle and paramedic at the scene.

The paramedic warned Ross that the ambulance due to pick Riley up had been held up ten miles away in Wymondham and urged him to drive them to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in his double-decker.

Mr Cork, who has been a bus driver for five years, put Riley on the back seat, got the paramedic and his wife aboard and headed straight for the hospital.

He said: 'I thought in circumstances like this that driving to the hospital had to be done.'

Mr Cork dropped Riley, his wife and the paramedic at the emergency department's entrance as he parked his giant bus in a shelter outside the main hospital building for Konectbus to collect.

Riley was given emergency treatment and checked over by medics before he was released from hospital in the early hours of yesterday morning.

Mr Cork has today said it had been a nerve-wracking experience driving his seriously ill tot to hospital in his bus.

He said: 'It's a good story to tell Riley when he's older, that daddy drove him to hospital in a double-decker bus.'

An EEAST spokesman said: 'This call came into our control room during an extremely busy period but this dad did exactly the right thing by taking the initiative as he did.

'Our paramedic was on board to give assistance on route should it have been necessary and to provide reassurance to the parents.'

He added: 'It was very good-hearted of the bus company to allow him to use the vehicle.

'We hope the little boy is making a good recovery.'Â
