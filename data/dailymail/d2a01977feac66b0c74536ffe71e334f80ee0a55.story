A retired police chief shot his autistic 18-year-old son after the boy tried to punch him, reports claim.

Kirk Eidson, 59, was in his room getting ready to drive Robert Camron Ingle across town to their second home in Chattanooga, Tennessee, when the teenager launched in with a clenched fist, he told officers. 

Grabbing a handgun from his pocket, Mr Eidson claims he tried to calm Ingle down before accidentally firing a shot at his right kneecap.

The former officer, who retired from the local police department last year after 28 years' service, then fled the property. 

But Ingle allegedly followed, hurling a flower pot at him that missed as Mr Eidson got in his pick-up truck, according to neighbours who witnessed the incident.

Emergency services were called to the property by neighbours.

The autistic teenager was taken to hospital from the scene on Sunday morning before he was arrested and charged with vandalism and assault.

He remains in custody on a $10,000 bond, WRBC-TV reported.

The affidavit states: 'The victim [Mr Eidson] advised he did not want to shoot [Ingle].' 

Ingle is schedule to appear before Hamilton County Sessions Court Judge Clarence Shattuck on September 22.
