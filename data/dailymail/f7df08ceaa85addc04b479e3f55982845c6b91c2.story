The holiday season has already started for King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima. 

The Dutch royals have arrived with their three daughters in Argentina - Maxima's home country, where they will spend several days over Christmas catching up with her relatives.

Princess Amalia, Princess Alexia and Princess Ariane joined their parents for a walk in the National Parc Los Arayanes at Villa La Angostura in the South American country.

King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima have taken their three daughters Princess Amalia, Princess Alexia and Princess Ariane to Villa La Angostura in Argentina for Christmas 

This is isn't the first time that the family have visited Villa La Angostura over Christmas - they spent the holidays there in 2012. 

But last year, they decided to stay in Holland as Willem-Alexander had just been crowned king.

He opted to issue the December 25 Christmas message from his home to the Dutch people. 

King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima have been travelling to this area for several years and have been known to invest heavily in local projects.

Maxima's brother owns two restaurants close to where the family stays and they often visit when in the country.

It is the third visit to Argentina this year for Maxima, who made an incognito visit last month to see her father who was ill. 

She also travelled back in September to celebrate her mother's birthday.   

Although she now lives in Holland, Maxima's ties to Argentina remain strong. 

She was born in Buenos Aires and schooled in the city of Olivos, going on to study Economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina in 1995.
