An Australian appointed as the most senior official in Parliament will be totally out of her depth, Betty Boothroyd said last night

An Australian appointed as the most senior official in Parliament will be totally out of her depth, Betty Boothroyd said last night.

In an astonishing attack, the popular former Speaker of the House of Commons declared the selection of Carol Mills a mistake.

MPs are also raising questions about the new Commons clerk, an appointment made by a panel led by Commons Speaker John Bercow.

Michael Fabricant, a Tory, said Mr Bercow must reverse the decision and claimed the episode ‘posed serious questions again about his judgment’.

Lady Boothroyd urged Mr Bercow to ‘remember he is not the master but that he is the servant of the House’ and should not act without consulting colleagues.

She told the BBC: ‘I’m very sorry for this lady, Miss Mills, because she is totally out of her depth, she has no experience, she has no knowledge of the constitutional role of a parliamentary clerk.’

Miss Mills heads the department of parliamentary services in the Australian Senate in Canberra – a job that involves managing catering and other services but does not involve extensive understanding of the country’s constitution.

As Commons clerk she would be required to give the Speaker detailed advice on parliamentary procedure and law – as well as acting as Commons ‘chief executive’.

Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘Unfortunately the candidate who has emerged does not know the Australian constitution let alone the British.

'She used, apparently, to run the Sydney Opera House.

'This doesn’t sound like the level of qualification needed to be the most senior constitutional adviser not just to the Speaker but to every individual member of the House of Commons.’

He said the job should have  gone to David Natzler, deputy to  outgoing Sir Robert Rogers,  who had a difficult relationship with Mr Bercow.

Mr Natzler has reportedly asked for documents relating to the selection process – raising suspicions he may challenge the decision to overlook him.

The row exploded after a senior Australian parliamentary official, Rosemary Laing, wrote an email casting serious doubt about Miss Mills’s suitability for the £200,000-a-year post.

The note reportedly expressed the ‘disbelief and dismay’ among her colleagues.

A spokesman for the Speaker said: ‘It was a thorough and very fair recruitment process.’

The Queen’s formal approval will be sought within days.
