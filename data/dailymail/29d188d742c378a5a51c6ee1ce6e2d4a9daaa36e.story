More than 60 Labour MPs are employing staff on zero hours contracts despite the party’s campaign against them.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has repeatedly hit out at the growing use by employers of ‘exploitative’ contracts that offer staff no guarantee of any work.

But figures produced by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority reveal that MPs employ 151 staff on zero hours contracts.

Of these, 62 are employed by Labour MPs, 77 by Conservatives, five by Liberal Democrats and seven by independents and the minor parties.

Mr Miliband was challenged over the figures yesterday as he gave a round of interviews about low pay.

He told BBC Radio Four’s Today programme: ‘I would be surprised by that, but what we have got to do is set the right framework in law.’

The Labour leader yesterday prompted fresh speculation he has had voice training to improve his public image. 

Ed Miliband, who is known for his nasal drone, appeared to have a slower and softer voice as he toured studios to promote his policy on the minimum wage.

Lance Price, a former spin doctor for Tony Blair, suggested he was displaying signs of media training.

He said: ‘Much improved delivery from Ed Miliband – calmer, no longer pleading. That training is working.’

But a Labour source said it was ‘not the case’ he has had voice coaching.

Steve Turner, of the Unite union, said it was wrong for Labour MPs to employ staff on zero hours contracts.

He said said: ‘It will appal ordinary people to discover that the country’s lawmakers are using “hire and fire” contracts.

‘Parliament passed the laws that are supposed to protect pay and conditions – our MPs ought to be upholding them, setting a high standard for employers.

'We are calling on those MPs using zero-hours contracts to move their staff on to secure contracts immediately.’ 

IPSA did not release the names of MPs using zero hours contracts, so it is not possible to know whether the list includes members of Mr Miliband’s frontbench team.

A Labour spokesman said the party had a policy of not using zero hours contracts.

But he said it was possible some MPs used the contracts when taking on casual staff.

He added: ‘A Labour government will give new legal rights to workers on zero hour contracts, including the right to demand a fixed hours contract when they have worked regular hours over six months with the same employer.'
