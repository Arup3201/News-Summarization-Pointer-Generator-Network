A chef who skewered a customer complaining about his slow service avoided jail time in Burwood local court today, after the magistrate was told he had been provoked.

Mati Rahman, 45, was found guilty of recklessly wounding Jamil Hossain, 47, at the Red Chilli Pakistani and Indian restaurant in Lakemba last March.

A fight broke out in the restaurant's kitchen after Mr Hossain - celebrating Bangladeshi Independence Day at the time - inquired about the progress of his order.

Skewered: Mati Rahman was found guilty of stabbing a customer with a tandoori skewer last March

Mr Hossain was part of a group of customers at the Lakemba restaurant who had waited two hours for their food, AAP reports.

Rahman was sentenced on Thursday to a five month good behaviour bond. Magistrate Margaret Quinn told the accused that jail time would have been a last resort.

Police prosecutor Adam Wilczek told Burwood local court that Mr Rahman continued to deny the attack.

'The accused appears to have shown no remorse,' he said.

The victim earlier claimed the angry chef had shouted 'Get out or I’ll kill you’.

Mr Rahman said he told the group of frustrated diners: 'If you come in the kitchen you'll confuse me and I won't cook for you.'

He also claimed he was pushed up against a 200c oven when he stabbed one of the men.

'I was next to the oven, where we cook the breads. I'm holding the skewer that we cook the chicken with. I had the skewer in my hands when he pushed me, I said you are not allowed to touch me.

'I was nearly going to fall on the oven,' The Daily Telegraph reported him as telling court.
