Baroness Margaret Thatcher is believed to have begun plans for her funeral eight years ago

Even from the grave, Baroness Thatcher has managed to rule how her own funeral will be conducted.

The former prime minister meticulously planned how the farewell service will run - from the singing to who gives the readings.

Baroness Thatcher is believed to have begun making arrangements eight years ago for the service, which will be held on Wednesday and will feature the hymn 'I Vow to Thee, My Country'.

Alongside the hymn, which was sung at the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997, a poem by William Wordsworth will be read out as part of a service expected to reflect Baroness Thatcher's strong Christian faith.

She instructed whoever was Prime Minister at the time of her death, regardless of political affiliation, to deliver a reading.

David Cameron is expected to read a specific hymn, John 14.1, which says: 'Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.'

The 19-year-old granddaughter of the UK's first female prime minister will read another lesson from the King James Bible, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The funeral, to be held at St Paul's Cathedral, will also feature readings from the Book of Common Prayer, including one that says: 'Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery.'

She is understood to have begun preparations for her funeral nearly a decade ago, and it is understood St Paul's clerics visited Lady Thatcher in person about her wishes.

The funeral, which will be attended by the Queen, will be held at St Paul's Cathedral in London

She was determined to have Wordsworth's 
ode on immortality included, which reads: 'Thanks to the human heart by 
which we live,/ Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears'.

Carol Thatcher returned to Britain on Friday to help with the preparations for her mother’s funeral.

Baroness Thatcher's military victory in the Falklands will be reflected in her funeral service on Wednesday.

Outside St Paul's Cathedral, the gun carriage carrying the former prime minister's coffin will be greeted by a guard of honour formed of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, the regiment which lost 32 men in the bombing of the troop ship Sir Galahad during the 1982 conflict.

The 10-strong bearer party has been deliberately selected from ships, units and stations 'notable for their service during the Falklands campaign'.

Hundreds of members of the Armed Forces, drawn from the Army, the Navy, and the RAF, will line the route of the funeral cortege as it travels the two miles from Westminster to the cathedral.

The Welsh and Scots Guards, the Parachute Regiment, the Gurkhas and the Royal Marines - all units that fought in the Falklands - have all been given a role in the ceremony.

Miss Thatcher, who lives in Klosters, Switzerland, arrived at her mother’s home in Belgravia shortly before 7pm.

She arrived in a black Jaguar accompanied by a casually dressed man believed to be her boyfriend Marco Grass.

A long list of celebrities, old friends and foes will join royalty and world leaders past and present to pay their last respects to Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister.

Before the carefully planned service, 
MPs and peers will be able to pay their respects to Baroness Thatcher in
 Parliament's Chapel of St Mary Undercroft on the eve of her funeral.

The chapel will be open on Tuesday evening so members and staff from both Houses can visit the former prime minister's coffin, it was announced last night.

Around 100 people will also be invited to a short service led by the Dean of Westminster welcoming Lady Thatcher's body.

Downing Street said Lady Thatcher had requested her body rest overnight in the historic chapel, and the Queen had given her consent.

'There will be a short service for around 100 people, led by the Dean of Westminster, to receive the body of Baroness Thatcher in the chapel,' a spokesman said.

The service will not be a public event and will be attended by the family and senior figures from both Houses.

The remaining seats in the chapel will be offered to members and staff who knew or worked closely with Lady Thatcher or who served her in some personal capacity such as housekeepers who looked after her office in the Houses of Parliament.

It is understood Lady Thatcher's body will arrive at the Palace of Westminster by hearse, and leave again by hearse without a formal ceremony.

The funeral 
 guest list drawn up by Lady Thatcher's family, with advice from 
Whitehall, includes all surviving former British prime ministers, all 
former US presidents and a representative of former South African 
president Nelson Mandela.

Almost
 all of the world's current heads of state are being asked to attend or 
send representatives – a move which, along with the highly unusual 
presence of the Queen, effectively elevates it to a state occasion.

A
 multi-million pound security operation for Baroness Thatcher's funeral 
was last night being planned by police, as fears grew that next 
Wednesday's occasion could be disrupted by protesters.

Officers
 will line the entire route from Westminster to St Paul's Cathedral to 
prevent disorder from a minority who have been celebrating the death of 
Britain's first and only female prime minister.

The £8million ceremonial funeral, with full military honours, will start in the capital at 11am.

Baroness Thatcher is also expected to be remembered - along with her late husband Sir Denis - by a plaque at a church in a village with which he had family connections.

Sir Denis, who died aged 88 in 2003, wrote a provision in his will that a memorial should be put up to the couple at St Mary's Church in Uffington, Oxfordshire, after his wife's death.

The Rev Rosanna Martin, the vicar, said today: 'Provided the Oxford diocese agrees, I would expect somebody to design a plaque dedicated to the couple which would join the six other plaques to various Thatchers on the south porch of the church.'

Sir Denis had requested the trustees of his £1.3m estate to erect a plaque, according to the Times.

Even her detractors would concede that Baroness Thatcher was a woman who knew her own mind, a quality demonstrated by the fact that she left detailed instructions for her own funeral service.

The patriotic verses of I Vow To Thee, My Country, will ring out in St Paul's Cathedral next Wednesday as per the former prime minister's specific request.

She also selected hymns To Be A Pilgrim and Love Divine, All Loves Excelling, and asked that lines from poet William Wordsworth's ode on immortality be read out.

Baroness Thatcher also instructed that the serving prime minister at the time of her death should read a letter from the Gospels, and as such David Cameron is expected to deliver the passage John 14:1.

The reading says: 'Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

'I go to prepare a place for you.'

The Tory icon's 19-year-old granddaughter Amanda - who lives in the U.S. with her mother Diane Beckett, ex-wife of Sir Mark Thatcher - is also expected to deliver a reading at the ceremonial funeral next week.
