Everton had to settle for a 2-2 draw against local rivals Tranmere in the Toffees' first game of pre-season.

The Premier League side had led with just minutes to go before Rovers midfielder James Rowe latched onto a cross to draw the hosts level.

Everton had taken the lead on 26 minutes when Steven Naismith stretched to poke home Luke Garbutt's cross past goalkeeper Owain Fon Williams.

Frontman Cole Stockton drew Tranmere level shortly after the hour mark as he chipped the ball over Everton goalkeeper Joel.

Roberto Martinez's side restored
 the lead seven minutes later as Leon Osman took advantage of some poor 
defending to convert Aiden McGeady's corner before Rowe levelled late on.

The Toffees made 10 changes at half-time as every outfield player was replaced after the interval.

Darron Gibson returned to the Everton line-up following a long-term knee injury sustained last October while Seamus Coleman was taken off with a sore hamstring.
