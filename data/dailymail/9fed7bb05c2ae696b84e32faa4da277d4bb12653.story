Nine-year-old Holly Lindley has glycogen storage disease, which means her body cant convert the food she eats into energy

Meet the little girl who has to drink six pints of milk every day to keep her alive.

Nine-year-old Holly Lindley has glycogen storage disease, which means her body can't convert the food she eats into energy.

There is no treatment for the condition so the youngster has to gulp down cold milk mixed with five spoonfuls of cornflour before bed to stop her falling into a coma.

The cornflour contains starch, which acts as a slow release of energy during the night.

Her mother Karen Shaw, 35, who has spent almost Â£2,000 on milk since the treatment began three years ago, said: 'We have to make sure she always drinks it because some nights she doesn't want to. 'We have to remind her it's for her own good.

'It would be easy if she drank fizzy drinks that are loaded with sugar but she doesn't like them so milk it is. We get through so much in this house.'

'Holly was diagnosed aged two after she collapsed at her home in Doncaster and her neighbour had to resuscitate her.

Doctors at Doncaster Royal Infirmary noticed her blood levels dropped dangerously low, leading them to believe she had the rare disorder, which affects just one in three million people.

Her energy levels had to be closely monitored and Karen had to wake her up every two hours to give her toast.

Mrs Shaw said: 'We were in and out of hospital. It was extremely stressful. It went over my head when they told me. We became always on edge.

'If I didn't give her food during the night, her energy levels would get too low while she slept. She sleeps around 11 hours a night.

'For about four years after she was diagnosed we really struggled, but now we understand it more and can control it better.'

Holly also has to do drink milk throughout the day - and can drink up to six pints. As she gets older and needs more energy, this will have to increase.

Mrs Shaw said: 'She loves milk and she's got used to the cornflour now. It's normal to her. She just doesn't like it when it gets to the bottom and it's all powdery.

'As well as drinking milk, Holly snacks on chocolate and sweets between every meal - I'm sure she's the only girl at school that gets two chocolate bars in her lunch box.'

Holly lives with her mum and stepdad, Alan, along with her two brothers. They try to maintain a normal family life despite Holly's condition.

Mrs Shaw said: 'Her brothers are older so they get very protective of her, but they do torment her too. They say she gets away with everything.

'I try to keep everything as normal as possible, but Holly still gets embarrassed about her condition.

'When she went on her first overnight school trip I had to have a word with her teachers because she didn't want to drink the milk with cornflower in front of her friends.

'Now she's older she understands it better and knows she needs to drink it to keep her alive. She's less embarrassed and will go to sleep overs and on school trips. Her friends all call it Holly's special milk.

'At the moment we have to do blood checks so that we know Holly's energy level is safe, but I'm hoping that one day she'll know herself when she needs to get her energy up and eat more accordingly.'

Glycogen storage disease is where the body cannot convert food eaten into energy.

Glucose is a major source of energy 
for the body. It is stored in the form of glycogen in both the liver and
muscles and later released with the help of enzymes.

People affected 
by the disorder have an inherited defect in one of the enzymes responsible for forming or releasing glycogen as it is needed by the body during exercise and/or between meals.
