Imagine logging into Facebook, writing a message about your favourite singer, actor or athlete and then them replying directly to you.

Well that's exactly what has happened to some fans, with celebrities including Mariah Carey and Samuel L. Jackson using a new app on the social networking site to 'status bomb' users.

Whoopi Goldberg even used the app to tell a critic why his opinion was wrong, serving him a hot slice of humble pie.

Whoopi Goldberg crashed Dom Lane's Facebook status to remind him she had been in plenty of good films 

Looking smug: Whoopi Goldberg is one of a growing number of celebs who have downloaded the Mentions app

The new Facebook Mentions app allows celebrities to see every time a user has put their name in a public post.

Famous people who have verified pages will then be able to reply or like the post.

The app was released in the US last month and is being rolled out across the world.

The first celebrities have started to reply to their fans and, in the case of Whoopi Goldberg, their critics.

Dom Hall did not expect a huge reaction when he posted a status about a film he had just seen.

He said: 'Whoopi Goldberg - cool. Any film she's ever been in ever - not cool.'

To his surprise, Whoopi wrote back: 'You are entitled to your opinion. But color purple is a great movie Long Walk Home I've made about 80. Have you seen them all? Lion king? [sic]' 

Mr Hall quickly ate his own words, replying: 'That'll teach me. Color Purple was epic. I'll get my coat...'

We see you! The app allows celebrities to see when they are being talked about on Facebook

'Love to your mom': Mariah Carey took the opportunity to say hello to a fan's mother through the app

Status bomb: Samuel L. Jackson told his fans he was still at a convention after he was mentioned in a post

The app is available for anyone with a verified account, and is being rolled out around the world

Mariah Carey joined in on the Mentions app after journalist Brian Anthony Hernandez interviewed and tagged her on Facebook, saying that the singer had said hello to his mother.

The multi-platinum artist responded saying: 'Brian we see you dahhhling!! Ps love to your mom.'

Thousands of people saw her comment and more than 200 people 'liked' it. 

Samuel L. Jackson is another celebrity who has downloaded the iPhone app, responding to a fan who saw him at Comic Con - a cartoon, films and games convention.

John Austin posted a status saying: 'Day 3 at Comic Con International featuring The Little Mermaid, Sharknado and not Samuel Jackson!'

The Snakes on a Plane actor replied: 'I'm still here m*********!'

Other celebrities who have downloaded the app include singer Ed Sheeran and New Orleans Saints punter Thomas Morstead.

The interaction between celebs and their fans has previously been reserved for Twitter, where users can message anybody unless they have a protected account. 

Previously Facebook users could use the '@' sign to mention a celebrity's page, but this was not easily searchable for the famous person.

Facebook product manager Allison Swope said: 'Nearly 800 million people are connected to public figures on Facebook, and interacting with athletes, musicians, actors and other influencers is an important part of their experience. 

'From cheering on World Cup players to checking out updates from favorite celebrities, there are more than a billion interactions between public figures and their fans on Facebook every week. We want to make these interactions even better.

Facebook Mentions is a new Facebook Creative Labs app that makes it easy for public figures to talk with their fans and each other on the go.'
