A mother of four says her family has eaten their last McDonald's meal ever after her youngest, a five-year-old boy, was served a six pack of raw chicken nuggets.

The restaurant, just a two minute walk from the Luke family home in Woonona, on the NSW south coast, served Tracy Luke a portion of raw poultry which was to be eaten by her five-year-old, Riley. It was one serving of a bigger order that the family picked up for dinner last Wednesday.

'I left the meal with the boys at home and went to pick up my own dinner, I said 'I'll only be two minutes.' But when she returned she noticed the boys surveying the uncooked dish of battered pink meat, she yelled out: 'Don't eat that!'

Raw Deal: Tracey Luke and her five-year-old son Riley

Culprit: The Woonona McDonald's is being investigated following the Luke family's complaint

She told MailOnline what looked like a crispy, golden peice of poultry goodness from the outside was actually a death trap inside.

She said: 'How can they sell this?!' She said Riley was lucky to have only eaten half of a nugget before she told her sons to put the box away. Â

'I thought this could kill someone.' But perhaps the most incredible reaction, Mrs Luke said, was the one reserved for the store manager when she went back to the McDonald's behind the family home to alert them of her complaint.

'The manager just said 'oh sorry ... we've had another complaint about that.'

'They just threw the nuggets in the bin and said 'sorry' before getting a peice of paper and taking down some details.'

Foul: The inside of the nuggets served to Mrs Luke last Wednesday night.

She has since heard from a McDonald's area manager, who incredibly, has offered the family 'vouchers' to eat at the restaurant.

'What good is that to us? We aren't going to go back there.'

A McDonalds spokeswoman told the Illawarra Mercury the company was investigating. 'We are disappointed that this has happened,' she said. 'We are currently investigating this with the restaurant and liaising with the customer directly.'

Uncooked chicken is naturally contaminated with bacteria including salmonella, listeria and campylobacter, which can cause food poisoning.

A spokeswoman for the Food Safety Information Council said to be considered eatable, chicken needs to be cooked at temperatures of at least 75 degrees in the centre, to kill the bacteria.

She said: 'People shouldn't consume chicken if it appears uncooked,' she said.

'There are an estimated 5.4 million cases of food poisoning in Australia each year.'
