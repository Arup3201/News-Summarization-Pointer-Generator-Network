The bodies of a South Texas couple who were reported missing in a South Texas lake over the weekend have been recovered.

A San Patricio County justice of the peace identified the two as 30-year-old Ronnie Jean Renfro of Corpus Christi and 31-year-old Marshall Shambo of Mathis.

Sheriff Leroy Moody says their bodies were found floating in the waters of Lake Corpus Christi on Monday afternoon, one day after they disappeared in the lake while boating with Shambo's two children.

Moody says the couple jumped into the water to rescue Shambo's 5-year-old daughter, who had gone into the water.

Family members tell KIIITV.com that the the couple's boat broke down about 2 p.m. Sunday just 200 feet from their home. They had let the 4-year-old jump into the water to go to the bathroom.

The girl and her 7-year-old brother - who stayed in the boat - were wearing life vests at the time.

The girl started drifting away, at which point both Shambo and Renfro - who were not wearing life vests - jumped in after her. The 7-year-old boy also tried to get in the water but the couple told him to get back in the boat.

Accident: The couple reportedly jumped in the lake to rescue Shambo's daughter, who had started to float away from their disabled boat

Shortly after the boy returned to the boat, he noticed he could no longer see his father or Renfro, but that his sister was still floating along. He then waved down some passing jet skiers for help.

The children were taken to shore as emergency crews began to assemble to search for the missing couple. Search parties scoured the lake until about 7 p.m. before giving up for the night.

The next morning, search crews began looking at 8 a.m. The bodies were found floating a few hours later.

It's unclear what caused the couple to drown, but officials are describing it as a tragic accident.

Shambo's mother, Donna Shambo Voyles, posted a note to friends and family on Facebook.

Loss: Shambo's mother wrote a note to friends and family thanking them for their support as her family recovers from this tragic loss

'I am not sure what to say or do right now. The shock of the last 2 days is consuming me,' Shambo Voyles wrote in her note. 'My heart is breaking, not only for the loss of my dear son and his lovely girlfriend, but for my daughter who has lost so much more than a brother, my grandchildren who just lost their Dad, and my family & friends that will never again share the joy of a beloved nephew, cousin, stepbrother, step son, grandson, and friend.

'My soul is bruised deeply and has a hole that won't ever be repaired. I do want to say thank you for so many lovely thoughts and prayers. They truly help. It is heart warming and comforting. I wish I could answer everyone of you, but please know your love is felt by me and our family.'
