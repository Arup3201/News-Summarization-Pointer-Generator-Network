Four men have been arrested after police swooped on an alleged credit card skimming syndicate targeting taxi customers throughout Sydney.

Officers found 800 blank credit cards, a card encoder and a laptop computer when they arrested four men at a motel at Chullora, west of Sydney, last week.

The cards had the potential to fraudulently obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, products and services.

A unit in Sussex Street, Sydney, was also raided and police seized two computers, mobile phones, and financial and identification documents.

Police will allege the four men were members of a well organised, sophisticated credit card skimming syndicate and obtained credit card details from a variety of sources, including skimming devices in taxis.

'I checked my account recently and discovered that $2000 had been withdrawn two days earlier from an ATM in a suburb I'd never been to and another $2000 transaction had been made the following day in the city. 

My card was still in my wallet and I'm careful to cover my hand when I enter my PIN at ATM's, so I had no idea who had taken the money and how they had done it.

Feeling sick I called my bank to report the unauthorised transactions and was asked whether I had used the EFTPOS facility in a taxi cab recently and whether the driver had complained that his machine wasn't working before trying a different machine.

Be wary of cab drivers using two different machines to swipe your card

That had happened to me a few weeks earlier and as the bank explained is a very common method used to skim cards and PIN numbers.

I was warned to only ever use my credit card in a cab, before the bank quickly refunded the missing funds - including both the ATM fees!'

The skimmed information was allegedly then used to manufacture fraudulent credit cards, which were used to make ATM withdrawals and purchases.

The Acting Commander of the Fraud and Cybercrime Squad, Detective Acting Superintendent John Watson said 'People need to be alert every time they use their credit or debit card'.

He went on to warn that 'It doesn’t matter whether you’re withdrawing money at an ATM, paying for a meal at a restaurant or settling a fare in a taxi, never let your card out of your sight.'

'Some skimming devices look exactly like legitimate payment terminals, allowing criminals to skim a card’s details right under the cardholder’s nose.'

The arrests came several months after Fraud and Cybercrime Squad detectives started investigating the men.

A 28-year-old Sydney man was charged with directing the criminal group, dealing in identification information and possessing equipment to manufacture documents.

Three other men, a Potts Point man, 28, and a Rockdale man, 24, and a Moorebank man, 29, have been charged with dealing in identification information, possessing document manufacturing equipment and participating in a criminal group.

All four men were granted condition bail and will appear at Burwood Local Court later this month.

Detective Superintendent Watson is encouraging any taxi drivers or customers who have information concerning the use of skimming devices in taxis to contact Crime Stoppers.

'If you are a driver and you were approached by people asking you to use a skimming device, or you are aware of other taxi drivers using these devices, please do the right thing and contact Crime Stoppers/'
