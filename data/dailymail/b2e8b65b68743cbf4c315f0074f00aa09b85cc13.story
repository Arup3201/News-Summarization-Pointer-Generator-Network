Lucy Mecklenburgh has been working extremely hard to get her body into peak physical condition as she launches her new fitness empire.

So it made sense for The Only Way Is Essex star to showcase the results of her personal training business in a sizzling new lingerie campaign.

Lucy, 22, has been unveiled as the new face (and incredibly toned body) of Caprice’s underwear range, By Caprice.

After Lucy was voted best bikini body of 2013, CEO and designer Caprice snapped up the reality star to front the campaign for lingerie, swim and sleepwear.

Taking inspiration from the season’s hottest trends, the By Caprice collection claims to offer women beautiful, sexy and feminine designs to suit all shapes, and Caprice believes Lucy is the perfect poster girl.

Model and entrepreneur Caprice said: ‘Lucy looks absolutely gorgeous in the designs. She has beautiful feminine curves, a healthy, toned physique and luscious natural beauty.

‘Lucy is an inspiration to all women for her approach to health and fitness. Her positive attitude towards body image encompasses everything we set out to achieve when designing the collections.

'It is such a pleasure to have Lucy on board.’

She's a natural: Lucy said she thoroughly enjoyed shooting the campaign and even picked up some modelling tips from Caprice

Speaking about her new lingerie coup, Lucy said: ‘It’s an honour and a privilege to be chosen to follow in Caprice’s footsteps. Caprice has always been an inspirational businesswoman and someone who I have looked up to.

‘I had such fun shooting the campaign, especially as I picked up a few modelling tips from Caprice herself!

‘It feels incredible to wear such gorgeous lingerie and it’s hard to find a brand that has such supportive padding but still looks natural, the collection gives you the most perfect shape.’

Lucy has been busy filming for her new fitness internet channel, Results With Lucy, which focuses on problem areas like bottoms and tummies using a mixture of cardio and strength training - and the ex-beautician is the perfect advert for her services.

Hard work: Lucy keeps in shape by doing leg raises, exercises using dumbbells, lunges and plenty of sit-ups to achieve the toned midriff she flaunts in the new lingerie shots

Lucy explains that growing up as a teenager in Brentwood she believed she was always 'tall and skinny' but as she got older, she started to notice cellulite developing on her bottom and upper legs.

She said: 'I didn't have a lot of energy, I didn't feel healthy and I knew I needed to start training really.'My biggest concern when I started training was getting too much muscle on my arms because I didn't want to lose the feminine look.'

Lucy follows a strict exercise regime focusing on an all-over body workout, including cardiovascular exercises like running, skipping and rowing.

She favours leg raises, exercises using dumbbells, lunges and plenty of sit-ups to achieve the toned midriff she flaunts in the new lingerie shots.

When it comes to her diet, Lucy cuts down body fat with a diet full of vegetables, fruit, wholegrain and 'good fats' like avocados and nuts.

'I still have and love my “cheat” days, but the best thing is, they’re now guilt-free, as I know that I’m on top of it!,' she said.

And her new regime is obviously working, leaving her feeling confident and healthy.

'I've noticed a difference in myself, I feel healthier, have lots more energy, and am more toned.

'I've lost all my cellulite, my body feels amazing and I've even started to get little abs,' she added.

Lucy was engaged to co-star Mario Falcone but is now seeing fellow TOWIE star Tom Pearce after leaving Mario for flirting with other girls.
