Shooting: Daniel Taylor, 18, of Tempe, Arizona was charged with first degree murder in the random shooting death of former Bangor man, Jeff Ward, on Sunday, Dec. 8, 2013

A teenager twice booted out of a Christmas party in Arizona on Sunday returned a third time dressed in camouflage and wearing a clown mask to indiscriminately fire on revelers - killing one man and injuring a woman.

Daniel Taylor, 18, who lives in the same Tempe apartment block where the party was being held, fatally shot Jeff Ward, 28, in the neck and was arrested after a three-hour stand-off with SWAT teams in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Taylor, who is unemployed and lives with his mother at 850 S. River Drive, was known to walk around the apartment complex brandishing the handgun he used to kill Ward on his hip and has been charged with first-degree murder and aggravated assault.

Tempe Police Sgt. Michael Pooley said
that Taylor initially seemed to invite himself to the party but was 
asked to leave when he was told he wasn't invited.

He
came back an hour later dressed in a suit but again was asked to leave but then returned for a third time armed with his handgun and dressed in
combat gear, wearing his clown mask.

'He was not invited, but he thought he could just come in anyway,' the sergeant said to Bangor Daily News.

'They asked him to leave. He came back about an hour later, this time he was wearing a suit coat, slacks and a nice shirt.

Stand-off: Daniel Taylor was arrested after a three-hour stand-off between him and Tempe SWAT officers after he refused to leave his apartment complex

The change of clothes seemed to confuse the partygoers but when he was recognized he was told to go.

'He came back about 20 minutes later back in camouflage and had a gun,' the sergeant said.

According to court documents, Taylor returned wearing a clown mask, and was spotted hiding in bushes near the apartment, before approaching the patio and shooting indiscriminately at people.

Bursting into the party at around 2 am, Taylor, 'reached into the patio area and just started firing rounds, six to eight rounds,' Pooley said. 

'Unfortunately, one of those did strike Jeff Ward in the neck' and killed him.

He also struck and wounded a woman, whose name and age and where she was hit have not been released as of Tuesday.

After frantic 911 calls, police SWAT teams responded and initially, Taylor refused to leave the complex.

The standoff lasted 3 hours before Taylor surrendered to police.

According to court documents, the clown mask was found inside Taylor's apartment and they also recovered a .22 caliber handgun, along with ammunition.

Ward is the son of Jim and Debbie Ward of Bangor and also is survived by a sister, Kelly Ward, of Bangor, according to family friend Elizabeth Wilson who spoke to the Bangor Daily News.

Jeff Ward was a 2004 Bangor High School graduate and was living and working in Tempe, Wilson said.

'He comes from one of the most loving and giving families I’ve ever known and this loss has fallen heavy on all of their hearts,' said Wilson, a Houlton native living in Portland.

'I reached out to his friends from Bangor, on behalf of his mother, to tell them of his passing. The overall response was shock.'

Ward was a former student at Arizona State University, Sgt. Pooley said as he revealed that Taylor's bond has been set at $450,000.
