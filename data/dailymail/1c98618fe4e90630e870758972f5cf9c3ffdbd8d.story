Police investigating a crash in which a disabled pensioner was run over and left to die have released details of a car at the scene.

Christopher Colegate, 69, who walked with the aid of two sticks, died after being knocked down on the way to his local Conservative club in Poole, Dorset.

Officers have said the driver of a silver BMW 3 series at the scene is believed to be a ‘witness, not a suspect’ and may have seen part of the incident.

After suffering significant injuries from the incident, which took place at 7.25pm on Friday December 13, 
the frail pensioner was taken to Poole Hospital but later died.

Police Sergeant Stuart Pitman, of Dorset Police’s Traffic Unit appealed for the driver of the BMW to come forward.

‘I
 believe this vehicle is a silver BMW 3 Series manufactured between 
March 1998 and February 2006,’ Police Sergeant Pitman said.

‘This BMW
 was in the immediate area of the collision scene at the time and I am 
convinced the driver would have witnessed some of the incident.

‘I wish to make it clear that I believe this to be a witness not a suspect.

‘The
 BMW drove along Wimborne Road away from the town centre, turning right 
into Dorchester Road in Oakdale then left into Darby’s Lane.’

After the incident, Mr Colegate’s daughter, Tash Motton, told a press conference: 'We were really looking forward to Christmas. It should have been a happy end to what has already been a difficult year for the family.

'Now without dad, there will be an empty chair around the table on Christmas day and unopened presents under the tree.

'We now live with the knowledge that 
every Christmas is going to be a reminder of this tragic incident. The 
ache in our heart will never go away.'

The
 popular Poole pensioner’s two daughters made the impassioned plea as 
they sat with their mother, Freda, at Oakdale Conservative Club in 
Darby’s Lane, Poole, Dorset.

Despite suffering from a chronic disability which caused him to stoop, Mr Colegate played an active role in his community.

Rachel Hayward, Mr Colegate’s other daughter, said: 'An innocent husband, dad and grandad - Chris Colegate - was taken from us in such a horrific way.

'The collision itself may well have been a genuine accident but we are all struggling to come to terms with the fact that the driver of that car did not stop following the collision.

'The driver could have come to his aid; could have called for help but instead, thought only of themselves and selfishly fled the scene.'

Police
 Sergeant Pitman added: ‘I am still keen to speak to the drivers of two 
other vehicles that were in the area at the time of the collision.

‘A
 Honda Civic-type vehicle travelling from Darby’s Lane into Popes Road 
and a medium sized light-coloured family car which travelled along Heath
 Avenue toward Wimborne Road at speed.

‘I urge these drivers to come forward so we can eliminate you from the investigation.

‘I
 would also like to trace a male pedestrian walking along Darby’s Lane 
toward Johnston Road who passed Mr Colegate shortly before the 
collision. This pedestrian was wearing a grey hooded top with the hood 
up.’

Grief: Mr Colegate's family (L-R) wife Freda Colegate , daughter Tash Motton and daughter Rachel Hayward, appealed for the killer to give themselves up to the police

Mr Colegate’s family paid tribute to the ‘popular husband, dad and grandpa’ following the witness appeal.

In
 a statement, Mr Colegate’s wife Freda and daughters Tash Motton and 
Rachel Hayward said: ‘Our Dad was a popular character and the nature of 
his illness meant he was distinctive when out and about and his frailty 
obvious.

‘Despite his chronic disabilities he remained independent 
and as active as possible. He was well-known in the community for his 
generous nature and happy disposition. He would do anything for his 
family and friends.

‘He loved his grandchildren to bits and would do 
anything for them. Every year on her birthday, he made his granddaughter
 a number for her playhouse to reflect her age. It is her birthday on 
Christmas Day. She knows there will be no number eight this year.

‘So
 many lovely things have been said about Dad since the collision and the
 family would like to thank those people for all their kind words. We 
would now ask that we are left alone for a period and given some time to
 deal with the aftermath of this terrible tragedy.’
