Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Gareth Bale are usually the best mentors when it comes to learning how to execute an impressive football skill.

The La Liga trio are masters at taking free-kicks, however an unnamed YouTube star has shown that he is more than capable of bending a set-piece into the top corner.

The man has posted a compilation of clips which sees him show off his incredible technique.

His poor friends, who act as goalkeepers, have no chance of getting anywhere near his strikes at goal.

Even in-form Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea would struggle to keep his curling efforts from hitting the back of the net.

The video, which he has named 'Best knuckleballs & Curve shots from 2014', has over 105,000 views on YouTube.

Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo are two of the world's best free-kick takers
