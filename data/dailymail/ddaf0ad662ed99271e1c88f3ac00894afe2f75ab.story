Senior Conservatives have warned they could lose the independence referendum in Scotland because its campaign chief Alistair Darling is ‘useless’ and ‘comatose’.

Momentum is even building up behind getting Gordon Brown to return to frontline politics to lead the campaign.

There are fears that the Better Together campaign has no ‘fire in its belly’ and could end up being outfoxed by Alex Salmond’s nationalists.

Senior Conservatives have warned they could lose the independence referendum in Scotland because its campaign chief Alistair Darling is 'useless' and 'comatose'

One Cabinet minister said: ‘We could be in real danger, we are not in any way complacent about this. The independence side have an easier sell.’ 

The source said there was even talk of the former Prime Minister Mr Brown being brought ‘out of self-imposed exile’ to lead the campaign.

‘We have to remember he is more popular in Scotland than he is in the rest of the country. But God help us if it takes Gordon to win the referendum.’ 

Labour’s own anti-separation campaign, United with Labour, is using Mr Brown as its frontman.

Sources said he would be ready to play a starring role in the main campaign if called on to do so and has already spoken about the economic stumbling blocks for an independent Scotland.

Another member of the Tory high command said they blamed Mr Darling, the former Labour Chancellor, for the lacklustre campaign.

‘Alistair Darling has never run a campaign. He is comatose most of the time.’  The source added that he had a ‘gut feeling’ that the no camp could lose.

Another senior parliamentary party figure said he thought Mr Darling was ‘useless’.

The Tory said that the no campaign should have used the Education Secretary Michael Gove - who is Scottish - or Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

‘He’s not a very good communicator,’ he said of Mr Darling.

‘You need someone like Gove or Hunt, but it’s difficult because the head of the pro-union campaign has to be a Labour figure - it’s hard for a southern English Tory to criticise him publicly.’ 

While Mr Darling was seen as a credible Chancellor, his low-key personal charm has rattled senior Coalition figures.

Supporters of Mr Darling insist that he has been doing a ‘steady’ job.

‘There has been no spike in the polls for the Better Together campaign since the white paper was released last week.’ 

The 670 page document set out the nationalist’s vision for a separate Scotland.

The Tories have just one MP in Scotland and some have privately wondered if the party would be better off electorally if it did become independent.

Another Better Campaign source said: ‘This is just nonsense. If you want any evidence as to why it is nonsense, you need only look at the work that Better Together - and Alistair Darling in particular - did last week to dismantle the nationalists’ white paper.

'The polls today show that support for Scotland leaving the UK is lower than it was when our campaign started.’ 

But the Tories themselves are largely unpopular north of the Border.

David Cameron has refused to submit himself to one-on-one television debates with the Scottish First Minister ahead of the September 2014 referendum.

The Prime Minister made his last major speech on Scotland in Edinburgh in February 2012.

A Number 10 source said: ‘We are baffled by this. We do not recognise these concerns at all.'

A Tory source added: ‘When we were casting around for a figure to lead this, we could think of no one better than Alistair and that remains the case.

'This was meant to be Salmond’s big week and they are no better placed in the polls than before the white paper.’
