An 1892 painting by Paul Gauguin of two Tahitan girls has sold for almost £200million - the largest amount ever paid for a single work of art.

Qatar is understood to have bought  Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?) from the Swiss Rudolf Staechelin Family Trust to be hung in its state-run museums. 

But the oil-rich country is yet to confirm the purchase, reported in the Wall Street Journal. 

Paul Gauguin's 1892 painting Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When will you marry ?) has sold to Qatar for almost £200million, it has been reported

Rudolf Starchelin, a retired Sotheby's executive who lives in Basel, Switzerland, where the painting has been kept in a museum for the lastfew decades, refused to be drawn on to who or for how much the painting had been sold.

But, if the reported value is true, it will mean Qatar has broken its own world record.

 in 2011, it spent £160million on Paul Cezanne's Two Card Players, after winning a bidding war.

At the time, it was the most ever spent on a single artwork, beating the previous record of £89million (worth £99million today) handed over for Jackson Pollock’s painting, No 5, 1948, which sold during a boom in the art market in 2006.

The Cezanne has remained out of view since it was bought, however.  

The oil-rich Gulf state previously spent £160million on Paul Cezanne's Two Card Players (pictured), which was the world's most expensive until its latest purchase

The Gauguin sold this week, which depicts two young women in a landscape of vivid colours, has been interpreted to represent the conflict between the two realms of European convention and Polynesian custom. Oil-rich Qatar has acquired many Western works of art in recent years, including modern pieces by Mark Rothko and Damien Hirst.

Philip Hoffman, chief executive of London-based consultancy organisation, the Fine Art Fund Group, said: ‘It is an amazing picture but this seems a huge amount of money. But in the Impressionist market a few “megapictures” will always fetch over $100million (£65million).’

Mr Hoffman added that such art works sell to a select group of as few as 20 people, who compete around the world to buy the most expensive pieces.

The buyer of the Gauguin was identified as Qatar Museums by two art dealers in the New York Times. The emirate’s museum has spent more than $1billion (£650million) on prestigious works.

Mr Hoffman said: ‘We’re seeing a huge amount of build-up of private wealth, and we’re seeing those people allocate funds disproportionately to art collections. People think if they buy the best you’ll never lose money. It has become the ultimate status symbol to be surrounded by $500million or $1billion worth of art which no one else can have.’

Ben Street, an art historian, said: ‘This is an iconic Gauguin; it’s beautiful. He is certainly among the most sought-after painters in the world.’

Qatar's museums are headed by Sheikha Al Mayassa Bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Tani, pictured, the sister of the Emir

Its acquisition is a coup for Qatar: the country, which is preparing to host the football World Cup in 2022, has developed a reputation for buying expensive art work over the last few years.

Its museum service is headed by Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the U.S.-educated sister of the Emir of Qatar.

She is understood to be keen to expand her country's artistic portfolio, revealing in an interview last year with the Qatar Museums: 'What always remains from the greatest civilisations and histories is their buildings and artefacts.'
