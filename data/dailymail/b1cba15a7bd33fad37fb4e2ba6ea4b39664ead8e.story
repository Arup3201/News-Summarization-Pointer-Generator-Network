This shocking photo shows the mangled remains of a car which a mother-of-two ploughed into a motorcyclist while high on drink and drugs, killing herself and two others.

Nightclub worker Teresa Mitchell, 38, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, caused 'utter devastation' when she drove while twice over the
legal drink-drive limit and after having taken a cocktail of amphetamines.

Mitchell lost control of her BMW and ploughed into 47-year-old motorcyclist Alan Dexter, who was on his way to work at a local homeless charity, while driving at 80mph in a 40mph zone near Mansfield on December 20 last year.

This picture shows the destroyed remains of a BMW car which was crashed 
by Teresa Mitchell, 38, while she was high on drink and drugs. The crash, which took place in Mansfield, Notts, 
killed the driver and two others

Ms Mitchell and Mr
 Dexter, a night support worker also from Mansfield, were killed instantly in the smash. Ricky Lee Goodall, 24, from Skegby, a passenger in the BMW, was also killed.

During the inquest into the three deaths at Nottingham Coroner's Court, it emerged Ms Mitchell also collided with a Ford Ranger pickup travelling behind Mr Dexter, leaving the 29-year-old driver with serious, life-changing injuries.

The court also heard Ms Mitchell had been travelling more than 80 mph in a 40 mph zone before spinning out of control, while Mr Goodall had not been wearing a seatbelt.

After the inquest, police released a photo of the destroyed car, while Mr Dexter's family spoke out to warn others of the consequences of drink-driving.

His son, Jonathan, said: 'I have lost my father, a good man, as a result of this crash.

'It
 is totally unacceptable to be drinking alcohol and then driving. Please
 don’t do it, don’t leave another family in this situation.'

Mr Dexter’s wife, Alison, said: 'He was a devoted, caring, hard-working father and husband and loyal friend.'

Ricky Goodall, 24, who was a passenger in the BMW, was also killed in the crash. He was not wearing a seatbelt 

Coroner Mairin Casey ruled that Ms Mitchell and Mr Goodall died in the collision while Mr Dexter was unlawfully killed.

She said: 'I find that from the time Ms Mitchell sat behind the wheel of the car intending to drive, she was engaging in a dangerous act without any regard to safety.

'Any objective reasonable, responsible and sober person would inevitably realise that her act of driving was likely to cause serious harm or death.'

Detective Sergeant James Greely said after the inquest: 'I’ve worked in crash investigation for eight years and this is one of the worst crash scenes I have ever witnessed.

'It was utter devastation - caused by the dangerous and illegal driving of Ms Mitchell, in what were bad weather conditions. 

'Had drink and drug driving, speeding and not wearing a seatbelt not been involved - the outcome could have been very different.

'I can’t say it clearly enough - do not take drugs, do not drink alcohol if you are planning to drive and always wear your seatbelt. It could save your life and save you from the devastation that is being faced daily by the families of those involved in this crash.'

Two other people in Mitchell’s car were injured in the crash, but survived following hospital treatment.
