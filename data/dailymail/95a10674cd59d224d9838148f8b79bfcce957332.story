Killer Oscar Pistorius has been exposed as a paranoid love cheat who had multiple affairs behind Reeva Steenkamp's back during their relationship.

The Blade Runner was convicted yesterday of culpable homicide, escaping the more serious charge of murder for shooting his girlfriend on Valentines’ Day last year.

But at sentencing next month, he could simply be fined - avoiding a 15-year jail term – after Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled there was a lack of evidence to suggest he planned the killing.

Oscar Pistorius, 27, was found guilty of culpable homicide after shooting Reeva Steenkamp. It has been revealed that the athlete cheated on her with a string of other girlfriends

It has been revealed that the 27-year-old double amputee started dating the 29-year-old model when he was still seeing student Sam Taylor, 20, and banker Jenna Edkins, 25.

He was also linked to PR executive Erin Stear and Anastasia Khozissova during their stormy relationship and broke up with long-term on-off girlfriend Vicky Miles that same year.

The Paralympian and Ms Stear were said to have seen each other several time in the weeks before he shot dead his model girlfriend.

He started dating Ms Steenkamp when he was still regularly seeing Sam Taylor, who would stay at his gated home in Silver Woods, Pretoria, four nights a week.

Her mother, Trish Taylor, said: ‘All his girlfriends were, like Sammy, blonde, petite and slim. I have often wondered what effect all these perfect women had on Oscar.

‘Did they in some way make him feel his own imperfections more acutely? Perhaps this was why he tried to control women and treat them almost like inanimate objects.

‘At first, Sammy was undemanding, obedient and demure. But when she got a job and made new friends, Oscar became critical and controlling.

‘She discovered he was messaging and flirting with other women, even asking them out for lunch or dinner. He was highly possessive of his phones and they were all password protected.

‘Sammy once saw a Facebook profile picture of a woman called Jenna Edkins sitting on Oscar’s bed with Kola, the puppy that Sammy and Oscar had bought together.

‘He always denied he was having any contact with Jenna, but the picture proved otherwise.’

Ms Taylor split from him after a year-and-a-half when she found he had been cheating with Ms Edkins and ‘a lady from New York called Anastasia.’

She said their relationship was tempestuous, with Pistorius often “screaming” at her.

Pistorius begged for forgiveness and in a series of messages he told her: ‘I don’t deserve your love.

‘You deserve so much better than me. I have lied and I have been secretive.’

It also emerged during the dramatic six-moth trail that Ms Steenkamp sent Pistorius texts complaining about his treatment of her just weeks before she was killed.

One said: ‘Every five seconds I hear how u dated another chick.

‘You really have dated a lot of people yet you get upset if I mention one funny story with a long-term boyfriend.’

Jenna Edkins confirmed her relationship with the star soon after he shot Ms Steenkamp.

She said: I would just like to say that I have dated Oscar on-off for five years, not once has he made me fear for my life.’

Yesterday, Mr and Mrs Steenkamp spoke of their ‘disappointment’ at the verdict on their daughter’s boyfriend, who shot her four times as she cowered behind the door of the bathroom in his home.

Mrs Steenkamp said: 'We were shocked. Shocked. Disappointed.

'You know your heart drops because you just want the truth. It’s going in the wrong direction, that’s how you feel.' 

The athlete will be sentenced at a hearing on October 13.
