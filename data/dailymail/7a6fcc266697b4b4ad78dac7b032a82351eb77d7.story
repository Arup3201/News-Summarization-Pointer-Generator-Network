Less than a week after British street artist Banksy's painting of a Nazi officer into a landscape of a mountain lake sold for $615,000, the buyer backed out.

The winning bidder, who went by the online name of 'gorpetri,' failed to make good on the deal, which led New York City Housing Works thrift shop desperate for another taker.

The original painting featuring a serene landscape was purchased from Housing Works a few months ago. It was then returned with the addition of a Nazi officer sitting on a bench, taking in the scene with Banksy's signature in the corner. After discovering the artist behind 
their latest acquisition, the thrift shop, which benefits the homeless 
and those suffering from HIV/AIDs, decided to sell the painting,'The Banality of the Banality of Evil,' at 
an auction.

Less than a week after British street artist Banksy's painting of a Nazi officer into a landscape of a mountain lake sold for $615,000, the buyer backed out.

Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00 to 'gorpetri,' who then was unable to come up with the funds to pay his winning bid.

Housing Works immediately went in search of another taker. According to Gawker the thrift store contacted the next highest bidder, who refused to pay a 
bid that had been placed in competition with a fraud.'

Other bidders wondered if 'gorpetri' was actually the elusive British graffiti artist playing another prank to drive up prices. They also started to complain that Housing Works was not telling the truth about how the painting made it's way to their store.

People gather outside the Housing Works Thrift Shop on 23rd Street in New York City to get a glimpse of Banksy's painting - 'The Banality of the Banality of Evil.'

Wil Emlingman, from Minneapolis who bid on behalf of a private buyer, told TPM that he is suspicious of Housing Works.

'They were in on it all along. They knew. Actually, Banksy's people actually contacted them saying, 'Hey, we're looking for a landscape piece, we want to paint a monster on it,' Emling said. 'So the whole story about somebody buying it weeks ago and then somebody coming and dropping it off and telling them, 'I need to speak with the manager, you have a very expensive piece on your hands here,' isn't the case.'

But Housing Works and Banksy's PR team deny all of the claims.Â 

A spokesperson from Housing Works said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the 'vandalized' painting last month.

'I don't know all the details, it was all done very secretively. But someone came in and dropped it off as an anonymous donation,' Housing Work's Rebecca Edmondson told The New York Post.

The thrift store was able to eventually find a buyer. They sold the painting to an anonymous individual who paid 'at least $450,000,' according to Gawker.

Before the auction, Housing Works hung the painting in their store on 23rd Street. Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00 to 'gorpetri,' who then was unable to come up with the funds to pay his winning bid.

'It was one of the largest gifts Housing Works has ever received and we're thrilled,' Housing Work's chief development officer, Matthew Bernardo, told TPM. 'We're thankful that he chose us as an emblem of New York to give his donation to.'

The charity donation marked the conclusion of the British artist's self-imposed 'residency' in New York, where he debuted a new piece of art every day during the month of October.

Banksy ended his month-long residency on the streets of New York with an inflatable tag on the Long Island Expressway in Queens. The last piece from Better Out Than In sits above other tags in a used car lot. Cops took down the balloons.

One exception was made on October 23 when he posted on his website that the day's art had 'been cancelled due to 'police activity'.

The philanthropic turn came after he penned an op-ed slamming the 'Freedom Tower' design that is replacing The World Trade Center. His critique- where he called the building a 'shyscrapper'- landed him in hot water with New Yorkers.
