Perfect partner: Alina is currently on the lookout for her real-life Ken

She has a devoted band of followers on Russian 
social network VK, and is frequently bombarded with autograph requests, 
declarations of love and even marriage proposals - but says that she is still 
looking for her perfect man.

The 21-year-old is is from Odessa in the Ukraine - the same city as real-life Barbie Valeria.

The pair were previously friends, but their relationship has since soured.

Strangely Odessa has become a Barbie look-alike hotspot, with several others besides Alina and Valeria attempting to achieve the doll-like look, leading locals to refer to the obsession as 'Barbie-flu'.

Valeria is known for her unique look - including her tiny 18-inch waist - and controversial views about ethnicity, which have seen her branded a 'racist space alien'.

In

the human race uglier and causing a rise in plastic surgery, which, 
understandably, sparked a huge backlash.

Alina, who also studies psychology and 
social work at Odessa University, says she would like to have two 
children and perhaps even adopt a child on day.

Valeria first rose to fame in 2012 after her ‘spiritual counseling’ videos became a viral sensation worldwide.

However, she claims that she has only had breast implants and that her appearance is otherwise the result of diet and exercise.
