A pair of kinky South Florida cops have been arrested and accused of threatening to arrest two women they pulled over for drunk driving if they didn't give them sexual favors.

Lauderhill police officer Franklin Harley, 32, demanded oral sex from the passenger of the car and then had sex with her for about 30 minutes, according to charges filed Thursday. 

The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports his partner, Officer Thomas Merenda, 35, had a slightly kinkier demand for the driver, prosecutors say.  'Officer Merenda asked the victim to punch him in the 'nuts,' meaning genital area,' court documents said.

He told her he'd slap her in handcuffs for DUI if she didn't, prosecutors say.

The driver refused, but Harley - having allegedly sex with the passenger reassured her. 'Tom really enjoys this,' Harley said.

Prosecutors say Merenda gets aroused by having his testicles injured - they even dug up two witnesses to confirm this fact - so they charged him with unlawful compensation, illegally benefiting from his position.

Both officers - who are married with two children each - have been charged with felony unlawful compensation and misdemeanor battery. Both were suspended without pay from the Lauderhill police department.

The lawyer for both officers deny the charges and say their families are standing by them.

'The only thing that's nuts here is the prosecution of this case and the way it's been filed,' Eric Schwartzreich told the Sun-Sentinel.

Prosecutors say the encounter began when Hartley pulled over two women, age 31 and 29, who were leaving the Vegas Cabaret strip club in May 2012.

The women admitted they had been drinking and Hartley told them both to pull their car behind a nearby strip club. He then called over his partner Merenda to join him.

Authorities say GPS trackers on the squad cars confirm both officers were at the location for 30 minutes.

The women allege that Hartley then demanded sex from the passenger and said he would arrest both women if she didn't oblige.

Merenda is accused of demanding he be struck in the testicles.

Both officers also allegedly groped the women before sending them on their way.
