A moving advertising campaign showing the last moments of life will be screened on television for the first time tonight.

The touching advert, entitled Symmetry, compares the end of life, with birth - showing that the two should be treated with the same degree of importance.

It has been created for Marie Curie, the end of life care charity, as part of one of its largest and most expensive fundraising campaigns.

A moving advertising campaign showing the last moments of life will be screened on television for the first time tonight

The short film - which uses actors - is one part of a £1million campaign and will screen for this first time tonight during a break in ITV's Emmerdale.

It opens with scenes showing important keystones in life - a child's first steps, a baby's first birthday, a teenage couple's tentative first kiss, a young boy's awkward first shave.

It is cut with emotional scenes of a couple - one of whom is dying - sharing a tender last moment, a dying man on a bed, his chin being gently shaved by a nurse, and a faithful dog resting his head on the knee of his dying master.

It was directed by Tom Tagholm, the man behind the ‘Meet The Superhumans’ film for the Paralympic advertising campaign.

He has been widely credited with de-stigmatising disability and injecting glamour into sport for disabled people.

He said: 'In the same way as the Paralympics, it would be great to get people thinking about dying in a different, more optimistic way.

'The Paralympics were saying: ‘Here are athletes at the height of their game. This event is about intense competition and dynamism, and there is not even a smidgin of pity’,' he said.

'Similarly with Marie Curie, it is putting death into a different context, the context of life.

'It is showing that there is tremendous value in the last moments, and that attention to small things such as the music you want, or the position of a bed by the window, that these things matter in helping you exit the planet in a way you choose to.'

Marie Curie nurses provide free care to people with a terminal illness and support for their families and loved ones.

The short film - which uses actors - is believed to have cost just under £1million and will screen for this first time tonight during a break in ITV's Emmerdale

The Great Daffodil Appeal is Marie Curie’s biggest fundraising campaign and money raised helps the terminally ill to spend their final weeks, days or hours with the people and things they love close by.

The charity said it hopes the advert will encourage everyone to give a donation and wear one of the charity’s daffodil pins during March.

Chris Dainty, Director of Communications at Marie Curie Cancer Care said: 'We’re really encouraged by how people have engaged with the campaign – even before the new ad has aired on TV.

'We’ve already had a record number of people signing up to collect for the Great Daffodil Appeal.

'Now it is time to really engage the public through Tom’s film with a message about the importance of delivering great end of life care. It’s an issue that’s relevant to everyone and they can show their support by donating and wearing a daffodil pin.'
