Relief: Silvio Berlusconi survives a no confidence vote by the Italian parliament and is congratulated by female MPs

Controversial Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi today scraped through a crucial confidence vote and lived to fight another day after a razor thin win in parliament.

If the no confidence vote had gone through, the 75-year-old premier would have had to resign immediately.

Mr Berlusconi, needed 309 votes to secure victory - with a defeat meaning he would have to step down - but he managed to pull the political cat out of the bag with 316 MPs in his favour compared to 301 against him.

Ahead of the vote the media tycoon 
had predicted a win and there were loud cheers from his majority ruling 
centre right coalition, while the opposition jeered and whistled.

However it was the 53rd vote of 
confidence he has faced since coming to power in 2008 and political 
commentators say he cannot last in office for much longer - especially 
as he is currently involved in four trials.

Professor
James Walston, a lecturer in Italian politics at the American 
University of Rome, said: 'It is a zombie government, not clinically 
dead but close to being brain dead, lurching from one crisis to another,
golem-like and out of control.

'Worse, actually, because Berlusconi is very much alive to his own appetites and aversions.'

Professor Walston added: 'The chances
that this government will run its full term to 2013 are decreasing by 
the minute. Spring elections are more and more likely and the overall 
prospects are not good.'

Immediately
after the vote Mr Berlusconi said he would 'transfer his main working 
office inside parliament' to show that he meant to solve Italy's 
problems and he added: 'We have managed to beat off the attempted 
assassination by the opposition.'

Opposition
MP Dario Francheschini of the Democratic Left, said: 'It's evident they
are losing pieces - every time there is a confidence vote their numbers
go down. We have to keep trying and we are not far off.'

Vote: Berlusconi won by a narrow margin. He would have had to resign immediately if he had lost

Mr Berlusconi
was under intense pressure after his coalition was defeated in 
parliament earlier this week during a vote on the state of the country's
public accounts - as Italy teeters on the edge of an economic crisis.

The
sleazy politician - who is currently involved in four trials including 
one for having sex with an underage prostitute – had urged parliament to
give him its confidence and added:''This must be done because of the 
risks the country is running.''

The
vote came ahead of a massive demonstration planned in Rome for Saturday
with 200,000 protesters expected to vent their anger on how Mr 
Berlusconi and his government are failing to deal with the economic 
crisis that is threatening to topple Italy.

Organisers said the slogan for the rally
would be 'Change Italy to Change Europe' and similar protests were 
planned in other cities across the country and extra police have been 
drafted in for added security around banks and public buildings.

Under pressure: Italy's Parliament has begun debating before a confidence vote that will determine the political future of the Prime Minister

Debate: If he is defeated - in what will be the 53rd confidence vote, Mr Berlusconi has faced since coming to power three years ago - he will be forced to resign

Italy
- the third largest economy in the Eurozone - has a debt of more than 
£1 trillion or 120% of its GDP and despite introducing a belt tightening
53 billion Euro austerity package earlier this summer there are fears 
the country is heading the same way as neighbour Greece.

Financial
ratings agencies and commentators say the lack of strong leadership 
from Berlusconi and the internal squabbling indicate that he is not 
strong enough to carry through policies and reforms to save the 
country's economy.

Besides 
the under age sex case which resumes next month he is also on trial for 
corruption and abuse of office and one commentator said he was spending 
more time 'talking to his lawyers then governing and should be talking 
more to Jean Claude Trichet the head of the European Bank.'
