Real Sociedad manager David Moyes is looking to sign Joel Campbell on loan from Arsenal but faces competition from rivals Villarreal.

The 22-year-old also has interest from Barclays Premier League sides but Moyes said: 'I’d like to add one or two to the squad, but on loan if it can be done.

'I’ve got one or two in mind and maybe some from back home who would like the opportunity to come and play in Spain. If there’s one market I know best at the moment then it’s the British market.'

Campbell signed for Arsenal in 2011 before being sent on loan to Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiacos in successive seasons.

Arsene Wenger insisted Campbell was part of his plans this season but the Costa Rican has made just 10 appearances so far, mostly from the bench. 

However, two players that won't be heading to Sociedad are Arouna Kone of Everton and Chelsea's Mohamed Salah after Moyes ruled out moves for the pair.
