A whole host of Barclays Premier League clubs are pursuing Southampton's Jack Cork, with just a year left to run on his contract.

Swansea, QPR, Crystal Palace and West Brom are all interested in the central midfielder.

Southampton are holding out on offering Cork a new deal as new manager Ronald Koeman runs the rule over him and defender Jose Fonte, who is also moving into the last year of his current deal.

But other top flight clubs are monitoring the situation of Cork in anticipation of a move.

Out to prove: Jose Fonte is in the last year of his Southampton contract

Taking a look: Southampton boss Ronald Koeman will assess Cork and Fonte before offering new deals

The south coast club acted at the end of last week to try to secure striker Jay Rodriguez on a new five-year deal, despite having two years to run on his current contract.

But Koeman is keen to spend longer looking at Cork and Fonte and said last week: 'It's a little bit too fast to have any kind of opinion. I need more time.

'But they are important players and, as always, if they will come in the last season of a contract, you have to do something at the club, and we will talk about that and we will make decisions about that. But it's a little bit too early now.'

Cork joined Southampton from Chelsea in 2011 and has been an ever-present in the centre of midfield during the past three seasons, helping them to promotion from the Championship in his debut campaign.

Last season Cork made 33 appearances for the club as they finished eighth in the Premier League.
