A family's car was written off and 100 homes were left without power after a mystery explosion sparked an inferno causing flames to come shooting up from underneath the pavement..

The Wakelin family, from Hackbridge in Sutton, were shocked when they returned home to see that their hedge was on fire and their car had been engulfed in flames.

The heat was so intense, it also burnt Bradley Wakelin's drive leaving it in tatters. The incident caused a powercut to 107 customers, who were without energy for nearly eight hours.

Inferno: Faulty underground cabling caught alight after the explosion causing a powercut to more than 100 properties

Mr Wakelin said: 'My family and I came home to find my vehicle and front hedge on fire with the firefighters putting it out.

'I didn’t know what was going on. I saw the car and the 
hedge alight and knew it wasn’t good.

'When
they told me what happened I just couldn’t believe it. I just didn’t 
think it could happen.

'My car is written off. My driveway is crumbled 
from the heat as well. It was frightening.'

Neither he, nor his wife Emma and daughters Kelsie, five, and Keira, nine, were harmed during the incident, but he Mr Wakelin is worried something like this might end up happening again.

'This was caused by a fire in the electrical junction box underneath the ground that had got so fierce that it caught my hedge and car alight,' he said.

'I feel that people of Sutton and the surrounding areas should be made aware of the dangers that are beneath us.

'I want to send a clear message to UK Power Networks to do something about the situation and the dangers it can cause.'

Explosion: Firefighters were called to the scene of the incident in New Road, Hackbridge, which engulfed a family's car in flames

Tackling the flames: Firefighters were called to the scene and put the fire out, but Mr Wakelin was shocked at the damage it had caused

Firefighers from Wallington Fire Station were called to the scene at about 5.50pm on Sunday, July 28 and
tackled the blaze using water.

A fault on UK Power Networks' electrical equipment beneath the ground was blamed for causing the explosion that led to the fire.

Similar incidents in April caused 
three explosions underground near Sutton train station, leading to 
blackouts in the town centre.

The incidents reportedly caused chaos
on the railway, with the departure boards going down. A lift was also 
damaged and the pavement where the explosions had been was lifted.

Across London, a manhole cover also exploded in 
Pimlico.

UK
Power Networks, which operates the electrical cables under Sutton, 
confirmed it was in talks with Mr Wakelin over compensation for the 
damage the fire caused.

A 
spokeswoman added: 'UK Power Networks engineers worked through the night
to restore power after a fault on the underground electricity network 
in the New Road area of Hackbridge interrupted supplies to 107 
customers.

'We appreciate how difficult it is to be without power and are sorry for the inconvenience caused.'

The faulty equipment was replaced and power supplies restored by 2.55am the following day.
