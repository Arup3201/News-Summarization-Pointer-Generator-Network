The ignition key from the getaway Land Rover, a petrol cap from the getaway lorry, a length of wire used to alter railway signals at Sears Crossing to stop the train and various books and publications signed by Biggs and fellow robbers Bruce Reynolds and Buster Edwards will also be for sale.

Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert said: 'There is an enduring appeal to the Great Train Robbery and artefacts are rarely offered for sale.

'Many of these items have been personally authenticated by Ronnie Biggs and Bruce Reynolds and they represent a little bit of contemporary British history.'

Although the gang did not use any weapons, train driver Jack Mills was hit over the head with a metal bar, dying in 1970. 

Heist: The ignition key from the getaway Land Rover will also be put up for auction in Northamptonshire

Much of the stolen money was never recovered but the ringleaders of the gang were sentenced to 30 years in prison following a trial in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. in 1964.

Biggs escaped from Wandsworth prison in 1965 and fled the country before returning in 2001 for medical help. He was jailed upon his return before being released on compassionate grounds in 2009.

The memorabilia will be sold by J P Humbert in Northamptonshire on February 18.
