Acting Union County Prosecutor Grace Park says an investigation has concluded that Mr Elberling shot his son late last week and then killed himself.  

Mr Elberling's wife Kate Chou filed for divorce from in May, though the divorce had not yet been granted, according to public records, reported NJ.com.

Today Joan DuBois, director of affiliate relations for the United States Chess Federation confirmed that Thomas was an expert-level player, who was ranked fifth in his age group in the country, reported the website. 

Internationally, Thomas Elberling was recognized as a 'candidate master,' the final level before master player, Mr DuBois said.

'He was a very, very good player,' Mr DuBois said. 

Jim West, a local master-level player, who played against Thomas said: 'He was one of the most talented kids in the country,' West said. 'I'm in complete and utter shock.

'His father was very supportive of him. Why would he do this?'

Mr West said Mr Elberling also never allowed anyone to take photos of his son.

'If you tried, he'd want you to delete it immediately,' he said.

Other chess players said Mr Elberling was very involved in his son's games and would often ask for the air conditioning to be turned down if he was worried his son would be cold.

Mr Elberling began renting the house down the street from neighbor John Crissom about a month ago.

'It's so sad - you don't want to see anyone lose their life, but an 11-year-old just starting his life, you know?' Mr Crissom said. 

The prosecutor's office says the boy did not attend local schools,and was instead homeschooled.
