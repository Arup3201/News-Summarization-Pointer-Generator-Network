A former international cricket captain launched the first claim for libel on Twitter yesterday after being accused of match-fixing.

Chris Cairns, 41, told the High Court his cricketing achievements had been turned to 'dust' by the allegation. He is suing Lalit Modi, ex-chairman of Twenty20 franchise the Indian Premier League over the Tweet.

However, the case, brought by a New Zealand cricketer against an Indian businessman in British courts, has been slammed as a case of 'libel tourism'.

The Tweet about domestic Indian cricket was read by just 95 people in Britain, Mr Justice Bean, who is hearing the case in the High Court without a jury, was told.

However, Andrew Caldecott QC, representing Cairns said the Tweet in January 2010 was picked up by cricket website Cricinfo.

When Cairns complained, Cricinfo withdrew
their report, paid damages and apologised - but Modi declined to 
apologise and pleaded justification, maintaining that the charge was 
true.

Cairns’s case was that the allegation was
'wholly untrue' and a very grave libel which would - if uncorrected - 
destroy all he had achieved over a distinguished 20-year career.

Cairns, 41, the former New Zealand captain, notched up the rare double of 200 wickets and 3,000 runs in his 62 Tests.

In evidence, he said: 'The defendant’s allegations have also had a profound effect on my personal and private life.

'It put a strain on my marriage. It hurts that my wife may think that I am not the man she thought I was.

'It hurts me too that friends, many of whom are former cricketing foes, will question my integrity as a man and a sportsman and that all I achieved in the great game of cricket is dust.'

Mr Caldecott said that all-rounder Cairns, who lived in England as a child when his father Lance played here, had considerable affection for the UK and minded about his reputation here.

At the time of the tweet, Modi was one of the most powerful men in the cricketing world and any statement of his was likely to be treated as soundly-based.

Counsel said that, in 2007 and 2008, Cairns captained the Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL).

The allegation made by Modi related to the second and third of these competitions, between March and April 2008 and October and November that year.

Mr Caldecott said that, in October 2008, Cairns was called to an ICL directors meeting in a hotel room where, according to the cricketer, his denial of rumours of his alleged involvement in match-fixing appeared to be accepted.

'No specific charges of match-fixing were ever put to Mr Cairns. No names of any accusers were mentioned,' said Mr Caldecott.

'He was never informed after his departure that statements had been taken - mainly later - from Indian players alleging corrupt activity by various players including him.'

Counsel said that Cairns was then effectively suspended for not declaring an ankle injury which had been exacerbated by a 1,000-kilometre charity walk completed in memory of his late sister.

Mr Caldecott said that the initial publication of Modi’s tweet in the jurisdiction was up to 95 people while the initial publication of the Cricinfo article was between 450 and 1,500.

'Of course these receivers are bound to be cricket fans - it’s the classic kind of allegation which runs and runs - one fan to another to another - match-fixing is a subject which is always topical.

'Be in no doubt that to everyone who hears it - Mr Cairns’s entire career is tainted.'

He told the judge: 'Preserving the integrity of any sport depends as much on vindicating the falsely accused as it does on convicting the guilty.'

The hearing, which is estimated to last two weeks, continues.
