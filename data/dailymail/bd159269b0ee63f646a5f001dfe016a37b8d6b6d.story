Owners of a nine storey water tower which featured in the Grand Designs TV programme have knocked almost £2million from the original asking price after putting the property up for sale.

The converted Victorian water tower, on the site of the former Lambeth workhouse in Kennington, south London, is now on the market for £4.75million. In April, the asking price was a reported £6.5million.

Owners Leigh Osborne and Graham Voce bought the Grade II listed building for £380,000 - and spent almost £2million converting it from a crumbling ruin into a family home, the Evening Standard reports.

The 100ft tower, which boasts 360 degree views across the capital, featured on the Grand Designs programme

It now features the largest sliding doors in the UK, nine floors, and a water tank which once held 38,000 gallons of water.

The 100ft tower also boasts 360 degree views across the capital.

It featured on the popular Channel 4 TV series Grand Designs, hosted by Kevin McCloud, in the 100th episode of the show. 

At the time, Mr McCloud said: 'I thought that story had everything.

'Conservation, ridiculous debt – he borrowed his grandmother’s credit card and owes £95,000 just to finish this thing – ludicrous ambition and extraordinary vision. It’s crazy but he pulls it off.'

In an interview with the Sunday Times in April, the owners said they were planning to sell the home for £6.5m.

It is not clear why the property's asking price has since fallen. Estate agents Hamptons International were not available for comment when contacted by MailOnline, but there is no suggestion it is directly linked with the appearance on the show.

Helen Penfold from the estate agents told the paper it was the 'most unusual' home she has ever marketed.

It is not the first time that projects featured in the show have run into trouble. In 2011, an ambitious renovation project to convert an 18th century church into a family home, led to divorce for Dean Marks, he said

It is not the first time that projects featured in the show have run into trouble.

In 2011, an ambitious renovation project to convert  an 18th century church into a family home, led to divorce for Dean Marks, he said.

He also suffered two heart attacks and serious injuries in the process. His home was also repeatedly vandalised.

He and and wife Hilary separated just before the project featured on Kevin McCloud’s show in 2007 where it was praised as ‘inspiring’ and won a runner-up prize in the programme’s national awards.

Unlike other property programmes, Grand Designs is not involved in the renovation projects, it merely documents the process.

In 2011, a houseboat which featured on the show four years previously was found apparently washed up on a beach.

The unfinished 100-foot long boat, known as The Medway Eco-barge, had been moored in the Thames estuary off Southend since it featured in a Grand Designs' programme in March 2007.

It is thought that the boat broke free from its mooring overnight after it had been vandalised.
