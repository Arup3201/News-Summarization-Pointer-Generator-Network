A furious New York City husband stabbed his wife to death and slashed his 14-year-old son in a fight over 'marital infidelity' early this morning, police say.

Gyltene 'Julie' Rugova, a 46-year-old mother of four, was murdered Tuesday - hours after she opened 'Sammy's Pizzeria' - named after husband Hasan 'Sammy' Rugova, 52, according to neighbors and authorities.

Police say the couple's 14-year-old son Ibrahim walked in on a fight between his parents in their Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, apartment about 2.30am and found his mother severely injured. His father Hasan had just stabbed himself in the abdomen in a suicide attempt, according to authorities.

When Ibrahim tried to intervene, his father slashed him. Ibrahim waited for his father to pass out, then gathered towels and pressed them against the wounds on his mother's neck in an attempt to staunch the bleeding.

She was dead when ambulance crews arrived.

Ibrahim and Hasan were taken to a nearby hospital. Both are expected to survive.

Furious family members called Hasan a 'drunk' and said he had long bullied his wife.

Police said the couple had been fighting about 'marital infidelity,' but did not specify who had been unfaithful.

Despite all that, the New York Post reports that Mrs Rugova had just opened a pizza parlor named after her husband. She was planning to run it with the help of her four children. Hasan was not going to be involved.

'She worked like a dog all day there,' Florent Ismajli, Mrs Rugova's cousin, told the Post.

'The pizzeria was for the older son and the mom. Sammy, he was just going to be the name, he wasn’t going to work there.'

Mimoza Ggikolli, Mrs Rugova's friend, broke down in tears when she heard the news. She had furious words for Hasan.

Investigators spent all Tuesday morning in the couple's apartment. Hasan was the super for the building

'Nobody respects him because he’s always drunk,' she told reporters.

'God is going to punish him with life in jail because he left four kids on the street.'

Neighbors say Mrs Rugova was from Kosovo and Hasan was from Montenegro.
