On the run: Killer Lee Wheeler was let out of prison on day release and did not return

A man who stabbed his best friend to death in an argument over a camera has gone on the run from prison.

Police are hunting for Lee Wheeler after he absconded while on day release from Sudbury prison in Derbyshire.

He is currently three years into a 10-year sentence for manslaughter over the death of Leon Kerr.

Wheeler, 33, was allowed out on day release on December 23, but never returned to prison, prompting a police manhunt.

After the news of his escape emerged, his victim's widow said she was furious that he had been able to abscond from jail.

'I'm disgusted that Lee has absconded,' said Paula Hendrickson-Kerr. 'It was such a shock and now the shock has turned to anger.

'I knew one day he would be eligible for day release, but not this soon - he's not serving his time for the terrible thing he did.

'It isn't fair that Leon will never spend Christmas with his family and that Lee has escaped, all we have is a pile of earth to visit.

'I wasn't happy with the sentence when it was made, it wasn't enough for what he did.

'Lee should give himself up and serve his time.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said today: 'We are following a number of lines of enquiry to trace him and believe he may be staying in the Birmingham area.

'If you've seen him or have any information that could help, please call 101 as soon as possible.'

Victim: Wheeler is serving a 10-year prison sentence for killing his childhood best friend Leon Kerr, pictured here on his wedding day with wife Paula

Wheeler was jailed in 2010 after pleading guilty to manslaughter following the death of his childhood friend Mr Kerr, 29.

The pair fell out at a party for Mrs Hendrickson-Kerr's birthday, when a camcorder went missing and Mr Kerr accused Wheeler of stealing it.

The victim went to confront his friend at his house in Birmingham, but Wheeler then grabbed two knives from the kitchen and waved them at Mr Kerr.

During the ensuing fight, Wheeler apparently stabbed Mr Kerr, and although he then tried to save his life the victim died and his killer fled the scene, before handing himself in to police the next day.
