An Ivy League lawyer accused of strangling his Weight Watchers executive girlfriend to death and keeping her in a tub of ice has posted a self-pitying rant on Facebook blaming her for the killing.

Jason Bohn, 33, has been charged with beating and strangling Danielle Thomas, 27, in their Astoria, New York apartment before fleeing with her phone, which he used to assure her family she was fine.

On Monday, he blamed his long-suffering girlfriend, stress, alcohol and his own abuse at the hands of his father for the murder - refusing to take responsibility for his murderous actions.

'I suspected she was a cheater,' he wrote. 'At the 
very least, I gradually confirmed she was a compulsive liar, 
particularly with regard to relations with the opposite sex, both past 
and present.

'Killer': Jason Bohn, who has been charged with strangling his girlfriend Danielle Thomas (right), has written a self-pitying rant on Facebook, blaming her for the killing. He claims she was a 'compulsive liar'

'As a result I grew insecure and 
abusive. In hines-sight [sic] one of us should've walked away. But, I was already 
madly in love with her. I was also extremely mad (both meanings).'

He described the night he killed her, claiming he got drunk and snapped but 'in all honesty, it was an accident,' he wrote.

'I woke up the next morning in complete shock. My knuckles were bruised badly and she was on the floor unconscious,' he added on his Facebook page.

Bohn dictated the post to his brother from Bellevue prison ward, where he is on suicide watch. Chris Bohn took over the page on August 10 to provide updates, the New York Post reported.

Murder scene: Thomas was found murdered in a bathtub of ice at the couple's Astoria, New York home

Jason, who graduated from Columbia and the University of Florida law school, stands accused of murdering Thomas, an analyst for Weight Watchers, on June 24.

Neighbours called police to check on her after hearing a fight, and the woman's dead body was found in a bathtub full of ice.

'Shakespeare couldn't have written a sadder, romantic, 
tragedy...I suspected she was a cheater. At the very least, I gradually 
confirmed she was a compulsive liar, particularly with regard to relations with 
the opposite sex, both past and present. As a result I grew insecure and 
abusive. In hines-sight [sic] one of us should've walked away. But, I was already 
madly in love with her. I was also extremely mad (both meanings).

'The night in question? In all 
honesty, it was an accident. In short, I was heavily intoxicated, under a great 
deal of stress, and completely blacked out. I woke up the next morning in 
complete shock. My knuckles were bruised badly and she was on the floor 
unconscious.

'Without a doubt she was the love of my life, and in the end I don't 
have enough emotional capital left for a trial and years behind bars. I miss her 
so so much.

'Currently housed at the Bellevue Mental Hospital Prison Ward. I 
alternate between crying uncontrollably in my cell while I stare at her office 
building from my window to fighting with other inmates over food.

'As some of you 
may already know I was institutionalized as an abused and abandoned child. 
Clearly despite all of my hard work, I never fully recovered. I'm not going 
through that again.

'Thank you for being my friends! Very heartfelt sorry to all 
of the people I hurt over the years, especially her and her family/friends. God 
Bless! Please pray for me.'

Police records show that Bohn has a 
history of abuse and had repeatedly threatened Thomas before her 
death, saying he would hunt her down 'like a dog in the streets'.

When
officers discovered Thomas, they found two handwritten notes in the 
couple’s Astoria, Queens apartment, believed to have been written by 
Bohn.

The first note 
said: ‘It was an accident…I had been drinking and I was drunk when I got
home. She was already asleep. I woke up and there was fighting between 
us. When I woke up again she was unconscious…I am sorry.'

The second note, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown, read: ‘Dani, I will love you forever.’

In the Facebook post, he maintains he loves and misses her, and described his bleak existence.

'I 
alternate between crying uncontrollably in my cell while I stare at her office 
building from my window to fighting with other inmates over food,' he wrote.

In a further show of self pity, Bohn added he had struggled with abuse and abandonment.

He and his brother lived in a Florida trailer park with
their father, who put beer in their bottles when they were babies, and 
turned Jason to cocaine, Chris Bohn, 30, told the Post.

The
victim's grandmother, Juanita Hardgrove, said added she is not 
surprised by Bohn's attempts to blame her only granddaughter for the 
murder.

'It’s to be expected,' she said. 'Jason murdered my granddaughter. What else is there to say?'

Ms Thomas was a senior analyst at Weight Watchers and had recently moved from Florida to New York to be with her boyfriend.

Neighbours recalled hearing her screams for help the evening she was killed.

'She’s screaming; she’s calling for help: "He’s kill me. Somebody help me,"' recalled the building's superintendent to CBS.

Loss: In the post, Bohn blamed Thomas' lying, stress, alcohol and his own abusive past on the murder

Other tenants said they heard the 
tumultuous and violent couple's brawls since they moved in. Thomas had even filed for an order of protection against Bohn, 
alleging that he assaulted her in May.

In a criminal complaint obtained by 
the MailOnline, a police officer described numerous bruises on her face 
and back and threatening emails she suffered. She reported the 
assault on June 7 and Bohn called her while she 
was speaking with officers.

'It's war, I'll dedicate my life to 
hunting you down like a dog in the streets, I am going to make your life
impossible,' he said, according to the report.

She went into hiding after getting 
her order of protection, staying at a battered women's shelter named 
Safe Horizon for two weeks.

It is unclear why she returned to the
apartment, but she was found bludgeoned after a friend called 
investigators asking for them to check on her.

An autopsy report by the medical examiner revealed that Ms Thomas died of neck compression and blunt-force trauma, NY1 reported.

According
to sources, Bohn used Thomas’ phone to text the woman’s friends and 
families hours after she died, offering chilling words to try and assure
them of her safety.

He
sent a text to one of her contacts saying: 'Please trust me,' adding 
that Thomas was 'fine' and attending the weekend’s gay pride parade in 
Greenwich Village.

He
also used the phone to call a former flame, allegedly confessing to her
that he got drunk and slammed her head against a wall.

He was eventually tracked down to a restaurant in White Plains five days after the killing and charged with murder - which has been upgraded to first degree - and evidence tampering.

'She
was my only child and my mother’s only grandchild. She was really 
enjoying New York. She loved her job and they loved her,' her mother, 
Jamie Thomas Bright, told the New York Post.
