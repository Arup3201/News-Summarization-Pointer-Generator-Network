Rolf Harris stood just yards from his wife and family as he denied a string of sex attacks on girls as young as seven yesterday.

The veteran television entertainer is accused of carrying out the historic sex attacks over an 18-year period between 1968 and 1986.

He also faces a further four charges of making indecent photos of a child but is yet to enter pleas.

The 83-year-old's wife Alwen Hughes sat in the public gallery along with his 49-year-old artist daughter Bindi.

The artist pushed his wife in her wheelchair into the building as he entered the court.

The family had 11 seats reserved in the public gallery for relatives and members of the legal team for the one hour and ten minute hearing at Southwark Crown Court.

Harris - who was awarded an MBE in 1968, an OBE in 1977 and a CBE in 2006 - is alleged to have targeted four girls aged as young as seven.

Bespectacled and wearing a blue suit, white shirt and red and black patterned tie, sporting his trademark beard, Harris smiled at relatives as he sat in the dock.

In his distinctive Aussie accent, he answered 'I am' when asked to confirm his name then said 'not guilty' to 12 counts of indecent assault.

Plea: The veteran television performer arrives at Southwark Crown Court where he denied 12 counts of indecent assault

Accused: The veteran television entertainer this afternoon denied 12 charges of indecent assault. He did not enter pleas to four charges of making indecent photos of a child

The charges of indecent assault Harris faces are:

The charges relate to four alleged victims.

Not a single seat was spare in the public gallery packed with relatives, press and members of the public.

Mr
 Justice Sweeney bailed Harris until his trial in April this year on the
 condition he live and sleep at his home address and does not contact 
witnesses.

Plea: Harris leaves the court and gets into a car today after denying 12 offences at Southwark Crown Court

Family support: Rolf Harris leaves the court pushing his wife Alwen in her wheelchair as he is surrounded by family members

Accused: Rolf Harris, flanked by his security guards, is charged with carrying out sex attacks on four girls over an 18-year period starting in the 1960s

Court hearing: Flanked by supporters, the veteran TV presenter arrives at Southwark Crown Court to enter pleas to the charges

The judge warned him his trial could go ahead in absence if he failed to attend.

He must also notify authorities if he wishes to move to another address.

Addressing Harris, Mr Justice Sweeney said: 'I am going to grant you bail on the same conditions as before.

'It
 is extremely important that you comply with each and every condition. 
If you fail to comply with a condition, the law requires that I warn you
 that you are likely to find yourself arrested.'

Harris met his wife, who is said to suffer from crippling arthritis, when they were art students and they married in 1958.

He made no comment to waiting reporters as he left the building.

He is due to stand trial on April 30.

Harris
 was initially charged with nine counts of indecent assault in August, 
but last month prosecutors confirmed they had added another three 
counts.

The Australian artist, musician and 
television presenter was arrested by officers working on Operation 
Yewtree, the national investigation launched after abuse claims were 
made against Jimmy Savile, but the allegations against him have no 
connection to Savile.
