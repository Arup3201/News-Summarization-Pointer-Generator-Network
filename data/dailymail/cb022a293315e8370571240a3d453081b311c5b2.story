A Fox News commentator set out to test the different reactions students at the University of California Berkeley would have when he waved a flag of the terrorist group ISIS versus when he brandished the flag of Israel.

So how did the liberal campus react? Indifferently, when Ami Horowitz stated his support of ISIS.

But when he declared himself an Israel fan, many students immediately pounced.

Hard hitting: A Fox news commentator waved an ISIS flag on the Berkeley campus and then an Israeli flag. You'll never believe which flag won him the students' ire

Shocker: The video appears to show that the liberal university's students had little to say about the Fox News commentator's support of ISIS, but were enraged by his subsequent support of Israel

'Israel is a thief in the night, and a thief in the day,' said one man.

Another man cursed as he walked past: 'F*** Israel!'

And yet another person confronts Horowitz to say, 'Tyranny isn't cute.'

Horowitz posted video of his experiment to the Fox News website on Wednesday, writing:

'Students at Berkeley clearly have a lot of intellect; it is one of the most prestigious and selective universities in the country. But do they have wisdom?

'I went to the bucolic campus armed with a flag that represents the greatest evil known today, ISIS. If these are our best and brightest then we should all be afraid, very afraid.'

Another man turns to using expletives as he walks past
