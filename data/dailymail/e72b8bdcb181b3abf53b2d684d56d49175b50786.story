The gloom that led to the abandonment of the first one-day international in Bristol on Monday was matched when England’s World Cup hopes were written off by two star ex-players.

Michael Vaughan, captain of the fabled 2005 Ashes-winning side, and spinner Graeme Swann, who retired when the Ashes were lost last winter, were damning in their condemnation of England’s one-day cricket in an animated conversation on BBC’s Test Match Special as rain lashed Nevil Road.

Don't bother: Former England cricketer Graeme Swann poses with the ICC Cricket World Cup trophy in Bristol

Stern: Swann says 'I love Alastair Cook dearly but I don't think he should be bothering playing one-day cricket'

Both believe England might as well not bother turning up in Australia and New Zealand next year, so poor are their chances of winning a first World Cup. They also feel Alastair Cook should give up the 50-over captaincy.

Swann, who believes England are too influenced by statistics, said: ‘I always felt we were so far behind the other one-day teams because we play such an old-fashioned brand of cricket.

‘Some of my best mates — Cook, Bell and Ballance — are not one-day players who are going to win you a World Cup. I love Alastair Cook dearly but I don’t think he should be bothering to play one-day cricket. He doesn’t need to. He’s made a very good point in Tests and he should leave one-day cricket to young people who can smash it everywhere and win you a World Cup.

‘We won’t win this one, there’s no chance, but in four years we might if we get all these exciting players without any baggage into the team.

Swann advocated the inclusion of James Vince, James Taylor and Jason Roy in England’s 50-over team. ‘I’d say Eoin Morgan would be the ideal captain of the one-day side,’ he added. 

No chance? Cook should relinquish one-day cricket because England don't have 'a cat in hell's chance'

Unneccesary: Cook ‘doesn’t need to' play one-day cricket anymore and 'made a very good point in Tests'

Vaughan, who was critical of the omission of Ravi Bopara from this series, was equally trenchant about what he sees as England’s conservatism in limited-overs cricket

He even said the selectors should have dropped him rather than let him captain the side at the ill-fated 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean.

‘We’ve made the same mistake now that we made in my time,’ said Vaughan. ‘We’re picking one-day squads on Test form. You need power at the top, in the middle and at the end now. It’s completely different because of Twenty20. I look at Alastair Cook and he has proven all the critics wrong in the Tests. I was wrong. But he’s been playing since he was 21 and this would have been the perfect time to move over in one-day cricket and have a real good break.

‘He will do half a job as a batsman and I don’t think he’ll win games for England as a tactician in one-day cricket.

‘Your captain has to perform and be a star player in the side.

‘I thought this was going to be the series where we were going to be a bit risky and pick a younger set of players who could strike at 89 and 95 (runs per 100 balls) and do some real damage.’
