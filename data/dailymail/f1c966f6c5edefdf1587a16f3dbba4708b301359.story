Popular building game Minecraft already lets users create their own worlds, but a new 3D gaming map now lets them explore the whole of the UK and build new settlements in their virtual back gardens.

Minecraft Britain was built using Ordnance Survey maps of the UK as a base and was constructed using 22 billion building blocks from the game.

It covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles of mainland Great Britain and the surrounding islands and each block represents 50 square metres.

Ordnance Survey used 22 billion blocks from the popular building game Minecraft to create the 3D interactive map of mainland UK and its surrounding islands. The OS Minecraft world covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles. This image shows the Minecraft version of Stonehenge in Wiltshire

To help players navigate the interactive world, Ordnance Survey has also published a list of coordinates to various UK markers, including Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

The map was built using OS OpenData - maps and mapping tools that Ordnance Survey lets developers use to develop alternative maps.

Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite
game world.'

They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves.

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

For each 100 x 100 km grid square, developers from Ordnance Survey used height information for various buildings and landmarks.

The left-hand image shows the Minecraft version of Snowdonia, while the right-hand image shows how the North Wales mountain range looks in real-life. Because the height of many buildings and landmarks in the UK is taller than Minecraft's built-in height limit, developers scaled them down so they would fit

Players need a licensed copy of Minecraft and around 5GB disk space on their PC.

The world covers approximately 3.6GB uncompressed and needs a minimum 4GB of memory.

To install the map, players should download the Minecraft-GB.zip archive

Unzip the archive to a temporary location. Open the readme.html file in a browser and follow the installation instructions.

They then loaded images of all UK locations from the OS VectorMap District files.

Each 20 x 20 pixel region of the map was analysed so the developers could select the correct colour, material and size of block.

The raw height data was stored in metres, meaning the developers were scaled down to fit within the 256-block height limit in 
Minecraft.

Ben Nevis, for example, has a height of around 2,500 metres and this was converted into 128 blocks high.

Ordnance Survey said in a blog post: 'Although this exaggerates the 
real-world height, it preserves low-lying coastal features such as 
Bournemouth's cliffs, adding interest to the landscape.'

Developers used diamond blocks for motorways, emerald blocks for A roads and pumpkin blocks for B roads. Water, forests and built-up areas were created using the standard water, leaves and brick blocks.

Following
this, groups of 32 x 32 chunks called regions were created and assembled together. Ordnance Survey said the whole process took around seven hours.Â 

The River Thames in East London is pictured. Ordnance Survey said the whole mapping process took around seven hours to complete. Each 20 x 20 pixel region of the map was analysed so the developers could select the correct colour, material and size of block
