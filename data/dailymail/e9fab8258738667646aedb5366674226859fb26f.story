New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler who made the game-winning play in the Superbowl says he had a vision that he could bring his team to victory.

The 24-year-old rookie, nicknamed 'Scrap', who was only signed as an undrafted free agent in May, said he really started to believe in his ability after a conversation with an Uber driver.

'When I really believed it is, when I called an Uber driver for my mom, my mom called me and told me, 'The guy spoke nice of you and he said he felt like you're going to do something fantastic tomorrow.'  Butler told ABC News. 

'I just prayed on it and I just went out and played as hard as I could, and it turned out great.'

Butler wasn't even part of the rotation to start Super Bowl XLIX, but proved his worth on Sunday - with Seattle at the one-yard line inside the final minute, he took a chance and threw himself in front of Ricardo Lockette, intercepting Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and ensuring a 28-24 win.

Butler, who used to working part-time at a Popeyes chicken joint, said after the game: 'I just had a vision that I was going to make a big play.' 

He told ABC News that the first person he wanted to hug and kiss after the game with his mother.

He said he wanted to make her proud after she spent his childhood in Vicksburg, Miss., working two jobs to support him and his four siblings. 

'You see some tough things growing up, and I just always said, 'I didn't want to have that life,'' he said. 'I wanted to be someone.

'And I just wanted to make my family a better family and inspire young kids that anyone, that you can do whatever you wanted to do if you put your mind to it and you just believe and have faith.'

Butler went to school in West Alabama, after he started his college career at Hinds Community College in Raymond, Miss. 

In 2010 he took a part-time job at the fast food chain after he was dismissed five games into his freshman season  – the reason has not been disclosed, but he has a charge for possession of drug paraphernalia on his record.

After working and taking classes at Alcorn State, Butler worked his way back on the team and eventually made it to West Alabama.

According to Twitter, the most tweeted moment of the night was when Butler intercepted the pass 

He said he had been warned during the week by coach Bill Belichick to be prepared for such a play.

'I got beat on the route on Tuesday or Wednesday in practice and Bill told me they are going to do that and they did,' Butler told reporters.

Butler, who played for the University of West Alabama after transferring from Hinds Community College in Mississippi, said he was alerted to the play by the way Seattle stacked their receivers.

'I just drove on the ball,' he said. 'I've seen some crazy plays (in Super Bowls) and I guess I am down in history for one of them.'

Two plays earlier Butler had been unable to stop the Seahawks when Wilson went deep to Jermaine Kearse, who somehow grabbed the ball after losing it.

'I did my job but at the same time, he caught the ball. I felt like the game was on me and so when I got back in the game that is why I didn't hesitate to jump a route and pick the ball off,' Butler said.

'Everybody earned this ring but I am just so glad that I could come through with a clutch play that really got the ring.'

Butler earned his nickname because of his habit of always being involved in the action in practice.

'We call him 'Scrap' because the first time we saw him he was so scrappy and he found himself around the ball all the time,' said defensive tackle Vince Wilfork.

'I think that was one of the main reasons he was in the game. He makes plays. 

'That moment with him making that play is just a fairytale ending to a book because of what he has done all year for us. 

'It is an amazing feeling to be a rookie and come in and basically win the ball game for us. Amazing'. 

Tom Brady said:'For a rookie to make a play like that in the Super Bowl, it's unbelievable.'

According to Twitter, the most tweeted moment of the night was when Butler intercepted the pass.

The deciding moment generated some 395,000 tweets a minute, according to the company's blog post.
