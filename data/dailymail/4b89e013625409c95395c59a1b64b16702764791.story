With a 50ft Hello Kitty helium balloon plane soaring between Manhattan's high rises, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was off to a flying start.

Three million cheering spectators swarmed the route to see 16 giant helium balloons, including Spider-Man, SpongeBob SquarePants and Kermit the Frog, bob their way through the streets of New York City for the 86th annual parade.

Parade stalwarts including Buzz Lightyear, Sailor Mickey Mouse, Harold the Fireman and the Pillsbury Doughboy floated along the city's streets while a predicted 50 million people watched from the warmth of their homes.

There were also newcomers in the balloon lineup, among them Papa
 Smurf and the new version of Hello Kitty. A 53-ft-tall Pikachu float with cheeks that light up is the first ever electrical balloon in the parade.

Organisers said they hoped the parade will lift the spirits of New Yorkers still recovering from the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, and thousands of those affected were given front-row seats by Macy's.

Beneath blue skies and 50-degree temperatures, the huge balloons were carried along a new route down 6th Avenue by 8,000 trained wranglers.

It kicked off at 9am at 77th Street and Central Park West, continued on to Columbus Circle and turned onto Central Park South. The parade then snaked down Sixth Avenue and headed from 59th Street down to 34th Street, making its final stop at Macy's Herald Square.

The helium balloons joined 28 floats, 1,600 cheerleaders and dancers, 900 clowns, 11 marching bands and, of course, Santa Claus. There was also an appearance by Miss USA winner, Olivia Culpo, who grinned as she waved at the screaming spectators.

The nation's biggest singing stars and celebrities also entertained the crowds, including Call Me Maybe songstress Carly Rae Jepsen, Jimmy Fallon and 
The Roots, Flo Rida and Whoopi Goldberg, The Muppets and the U.S. 
Olympic gold medalists in gymnastics known as The Fab Five.

Some parade-goers had camped out overnight to get a good spot, while others came well-prepared with folding chairs.

Alan Batt and his 11-year-old twins, Kyto and Elina, watched the parade at the end of the route, seemingly too far away for a good view. But they had an advantage: Two tall stepladders they hauled over from their apartment eight blocks away - one for each twin.

'We're New Yorkers,' the 65-year-old Batt said. 'We know what we're doing.'

With the height advantage, 'I get to see everything!' Kyto said.

But it's not all joy as the parade snakes through the city, with Today host Matt Lauer coming under fire from viewers for his on-air blunders, while others criticised the decades-long tradition going ahead amid world helium shortages.

'Really Matt Lauer?,' one Twitter user ranted when the host mispronounced the title of a Gershwin song on air. '"S. Wonderful"? Try "S'Wonderful," one of the most popular Gershwin songs ever written. Heard of the Gershwins?'

Yet others stayed in the festive mood while watching the parade, with organisers saying they hope 
that the display will help lift the 
spirits of New Yorkers who are still recovering from the aftermath of 
Superstorm Sandy.

In a
 special tribute to those suffering from the effects of the hurricane 
and those helping the victims, the parade featured a float dedicated
 to first responders and each person marching in the lineup wore a
 Red Cross pin.

‘The
 parade has always been about family, coming together and about 
Thanksgiving when everyone comes together to celebrate,’ Kule said. 
‘This year, I believe it will be even more important and I believe will 
represent as a beacon of hope for the entire tri-state area.’

Macy's also gave 5,000 tickets to families affected by the storm and organised transportation to whisk them to the route.

'Coming here is a good distraction,' 
Chris Tamis, who only just recently had power returned to his Smithtown,
 New York home, told NBC. 'A lot of people are coming to get away from 
it.'

New York Mayor Michael
 Bloomberg announced that the city, along with local groups and 
businesses, is organising 26,500 Thanksgiving meals for those hit by 
the storm.

'Those people 
who don’t have heat, electricity, water, we have a responsibility to get
 them back and get their lives back and maybe next year they'll be back 
here smiling as well,' he said.

Speaking
 to CBS before the parade, Bloomberg revealed he would be spending his 
Thanksgiving Day visiting police and firefighters in the Rockaways 
before thanking volunteers.

Of the parade, he added: 'This is an American institution and it just happens to be held in New 
York. You go across this country... everyone understands that we do have a
 lot to be thankful for.'

U.S.
 Rep. Gregory Meeks, whose New York district includes the heavily 
battered Rockaways neighborhoods, said he planned to stop by 
Thanksgiving dinners at three churches and a school on Thursday.

'They are still giving thanks,' Meeks
 said of his constituents. 'They are thankful that they're alive and 
thankful to the people who are coming to help them.'

Between 3pm and 10pm on Wednesday, 
the dozens of flattened balloons depicting comic book characters were 
all laid out on the ground around the Museum of Natural History and 
blown up with helium to their full size.

‘Each one of the elements in the 
parade start as a simple sketch, and we sit with the artist and talk 
about what we want to see come to life,’ Amy Kule, executive producer of
 the parade, told 9News.

Spectators
 who decided to brave the chill and come out Wednesday to witness the 
last-minute preparations for the main event got a chance for get a close
 look at their favorite balloons without jostling for space with three 
million other people.

The
 first Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was held in 1924 when it was known
 as the Macy's Christmas Parade and starred animals from the Central 
Park Zoo. In 1927, it debuted its first helium character balloon, Felix 
the Cat.
