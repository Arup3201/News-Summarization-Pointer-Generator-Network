Morgan Schneiderlin sat in a room at Strasbourg's academy surrounded by 39 other youth players watching Liverpool's miracle comeback against AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League final.

The atmosphere was charged and excitement buzzed between the bodies. Schneiderlin was 16 at the time and just playing in the Barclays Premier League was a dream, let alone a Champions League final.

'In France when you watch TV you have to choose between Liverpool and Manchester United and I chose Liverpool,' Schneiderlin told Sportsmail in 2012. 'I used to and still love Steven Gerrard as a player.'

But with Southampton flying in the top-flight, sitting second in the league, and Arsenal and Tottenham waiting in the wings, playing in European football's elite competition is surely not far off.

When the 25-year-old joined Southampton for £1.2million in 2008, playing in the Championship was a long way from the heady heights of today.

'When I first came I had no-one who spoke French so it took me a bit longer to adapt to the style,' Schneiderlin added, 'because if you have a good lifestyle it will give you more confidence to play on the pitch.

'My target was always to play in the Premier League. Of course France is my country and I love it, I miss it a bit, but England is my second home.'

Schneiderlin was an ever-present in the side who were relegated to League One two years after joining them, were bottom of the league and docked 10 points. It was the lowest, darkest moment in the club's history. It was even further from his ambitions.

Yet those experiences have moulded the Frenchman into the tough midfield general he has become. Even after helping the south coast club secure back-to-back promotions, his displays were often overshadowed by his team-mates in the top flight.

But Schneiderlin was always there, always helping the them tick along and was never one to let the lack of spotlight knock his confidence on the pitch.

Ahead of facing Liverpool in December of their first season back in the top flight, Schneiderlin said: 'I want to confront him and see what I can do against him. He's one of the best players in the world and that's who I want to play against every game, the best in the world.

'If I have to tackle I do it. In the Premier League you play against better players so you need to be more aware. You need to put the effort in otherwise you get beaten. You need to be on your toes all the time. I'm a very bad loser.'

Following the departures of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers, it is Schneiderlin who has emerged as one of the most effective midfielders in not only Southampton's team, but the whole league.

Crystal Palace's Mile Jedinak is the only midfielder to make more than his 43 tackles this campaign. His 766 passes puts him fifth amongst his counterparts, behind Ki Sung-Yeung, Daley Blind, Yaya Toure and Eden Hazard. Of those, he has completed 89 per cent. And he has weighed in with three goals already.

Before Schneiderlin, who now has six caps for France, played at Anfield for the first time, in that match in 2012 which they lost 1-0, friends back in France rang him to see if he would get Gerrard's shirt after the match.

If he starts playing Champions League football, it will be Schneiderlin's shirt they're all after.
