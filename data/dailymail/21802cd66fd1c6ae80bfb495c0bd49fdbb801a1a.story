The devastated 11-year-old girl who was forced to shut down her lemonade stand by a local council got up at 4am to cook fresh goods for the stall and lay out furniture to make it look like a cafe.

Chelsea Ruderforth, whipped up a delicious range of treats to sell on a quiet country road near her house to make some money before Christmas but someone reported her to the red-tape enforcers at Bunbury City Council, in Western Australia.  

The council complained the food she was selling was 'high risk' and that she 'set up a marquee with a couch, chairs and tables in a location where it was unsafe for passing vehicles to pull over safely'. 

'It is such a sad day when a kid can't make a bit of extra cash just selling a few cupcakes and lemonade,' Chelsea's mother Marissa told 720 ABC Perth.

 Lemon meringue pie, lemon butter cupcakes and fresh organic lemonade were all on offer from ‘11am until sold out’ on 19 December, said the girl in a handwritten poster which was shared on social media to drum up business.  

But someone reported her entrepreneurial plans to the council before the sale had even begun and before she'd even served her first customer.

Her outraged mother posted on Facebook that her daughter had her pop-up stall shut down by the council.

'We had our four-wheel-drive with a fridge, we had ice - everyone is aware what you need to do with food,' Ms Ruderforth told the ABC.

Environmental health manager at Bunbury City Council, Sarah Upton, told The West Australian the girl’s stall was ‘high risk’.

‘Unfortunately the stall was selling food without a permit and the young girl in charge was preparing food without approval,’ Ms Upton explained.

The council worker also complained that the girl had no ‘temperature control’ and her location was posing a problem for cars to pull over safely on the side of Brittain Road. 

On Tuesday, Ms Upton told the ABC that Chelsea would have to look at making her food in a commercial kitchen if she wanted to try again.
