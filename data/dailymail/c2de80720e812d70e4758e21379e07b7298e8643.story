A teenage soap star today denied raping and molesting a 14-year-old boy during a three-month campaign of sexual abuse.

The 17-year-old is accused of forcing the boy to perform oral sex on him at a south London theatre.

The TV actor, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is also accused of fondling his victim in the changing rooms of a London stage school and in nearby public toilets.

Accused: A teenage soap star today denied raping and molesting a 14-year-old boy during a three-month campaign of sexual abuse. He appeared at Blackfriars Crown Court

The alleged attacks took place while the pair attended the same stage school between July and September 2010.

The teenager appeared this morning at Blackfriars Crown Court to formally enter not guilty pleas to one count of rape and three counts of sexual assault.

Wearing a grey jacket with brown leather elbow patches, skinny blue jeans with turn-ups, and an open collar white shirt, the actor spoke to confirm his name and say 'not guilty' four times. 

Judge John Hillen set the trial date for 18 March and released the teenager on bail until the start of the two-week trial. 

'Today's hearing was to find out whether you plead guilty or not guilty, and you pleaded not guilty', he said. 

'You are released on bail, and if you fail to attend for trial it will take in your absence.' 

The teenager from Surrey pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault in July 2010 and two counts of sexual assault in September 2010.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
