Cherie Blair attacked Jacques Chirac like an 'Exocet' missile in a verbal slap that won London the 2012 Olympics, architect of the Games Lord Coe said today.

In an onslaught on British cuisine the former French president had said 'you can't trust people who cook like that' so the furious Mrs Blair went at him 'like a banshee' on the eve of the key 2005 IOC vote in Singapore.

In his new autobiography Lord Coe says her intervention 'played straight into our hands' and forced Chirac to scurry away from a party where he was due to lobby for the Paris bid, allowing him to fight London's case unhindered.

'She won it for us': Lord Coe says Cherie Blair went for Jacques Chirac after he criticised British food, forcing him to leave a party and allowing Seb to lobby people to vote for London 2012's bid

Chirac had joked with Russia's Vladamir Putin and Germany's Gerhard Schroder about the standard of British cuisine at the G8 summit at Gleneagles, because they were going to be fed haggis.

'You can't trust people who cook as badly as that. After Finland it's the country with the worst food,' he said, prompting Cherie to give him a verbal battering when they met in Singapore in July 2005.

In 'Running My Life,' which is serialised in The Times, Lord Coe said: 'I spotted Cherie heading like a heat-seeking missile towards the French contingent. Above the hubbub her voice rang loud and clear "I gather you've been saying rude things about our food", at a volume that would have done justice to a packed courtroom.'

Looking shocked Chirac then replied 'do not believe every-zing you read,' before Mrs Blair 'got stuck in' and berating him again said: 'I didn't read it. I saw it on television.'

Meanwhile Tony Blair, who was stood with Seb Coe turned away and then told him that when his wife 'says something she really means it.'

Lord Coe went on: 'She was at him like a banshee and he couldn't get out of that building fast enough. Chirac had met nobody who really mattered.'

Paris had been in pole position to win the 2012 Games, way ahead of London in terms of IOC support, but after an incredible effort by David Beckham as well as other politicians and British sportsmen, London beat its French rival by 54 votes to 50 - with two crucial votes from Finland, who had also been attacked by Chirac days earlier.

There were reports about Chirac’s mistake across all French media, including TF1, the main national TV channel.

Cherie Blair's verbal crushing of Jacques Chirac took seven years to come out, but it is another example of her appetite for a good row.

Earlier this year she launched an astonishing 
attack on stay-at-home mothers, warning that it was 'dangerous' for women to 
rely on their husbands.

Mrs Blair went on to criticise 'yummy mummies' 
who marry rich men and put their energies into raising children rather than 
concentrating on their careers - and was accused of 'bullying' women who stay at home.

'One of the things that worries me now is you see young women who say, “I look 
at the sacrifices that women have made and I think why do I need to bother, why 
can't I just marry a rich husband and retire?” and you think, how can they even 
imagine that is the way to fulfil yourself, how dangerous it is,' she said.

Previously she also accused men of being more 
selfish than women when it comes to spending money, saying they are more likely to spend cash on themselves rather than on relatives or within the 
community and also said that even Tunisia had done for equal rights for women than Britain had.

Le Parisien newspaper ran the headline: ‘Paris favourite for the 2012 Olympics before a Chirac joke about British cuisine’.

The website of France TV meanwhile carried the story using the words:  ‘Chirac lost the 2012 Olympics for Paris’.

The French capital had invested 
millions into its dream of holding the games this year – even printing 
Metro and other transport maps with Olympic symbols.

Paris was absolutely convinced it 
would beat London but the plodding Mr Chirac did not share the 
enthusiasm of his more dynamic countrymen.

Two years after the debacle he gave up the presidency, and was then indicted on corruption charges.

Chirac, who regularly attacked 
Anglo-Saxon culture and complained about English being the world’s 
number one language, was in December given a suspended prison sentence.

Despite all this he remained a 
relatively popular figure across France – something which is likely to 
change following today’s astonishing revelations.

When London won Lord Coe says he wondered whether he had heard the result correctly while members of the IOC were equally shell-shocked, he said.

But their unbridled joy was incredibly short-lived as the next day they were told suicide bombers had attacked the London transport network and killed 52 people.

'In the space of five minutes we had gone from elation to dumb incomprehension and horror,' he said.
