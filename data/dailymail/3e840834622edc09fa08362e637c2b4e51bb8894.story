A Californian high school basketball team will be allowed to wear 'I can't breathe' protest shirts after a school district reversed the decision to  ban them from playing. 

The players from Mendocino High School had been told that they would not be able to wear the T-shirts in memory of Eric Garner by officials at the Fort Bragg School district.

But the decision was reversed on Monday, and high school players will be allowed to wear the shirts during warm-ups as long as they do not cause problems, lawyers said.

Decision: The athletic director for Mendocino High School (pictured) had been informed by his counterpart at Fort Bragg High School this week that neither the boys nor girls teams would be allowed to participate in the three day tournament hosted by Fort Bragg High but this decision had now changed

Karen Boyd, a First Amendment lawyer who represented one of the players, said the reversal by the Fort Bragg School District came just moments before she intended to file a federal court motion.

Boyd said she intended to arguing that barring the shirts violated the free speech rights of student athletes.

The agreement will stand as long as the shirts do not cause any serious problems at the tournament. 

It also allows spectators to wear the shirts, which several did as the tournament got underway Monday at Fort Bragg High School, Boyd said.

'This is always my preference, if we can get things worked out without a lot of court stuff,' she said.

The T-shirts feature the last words of Garner, a New York man who died after an officer put him in a chokehold. 

In amateur video taken of the arrest,  Garner was seen being forced to the ground and held down while he was being cuffed.

The father of six, died after saying: 'I can't breathe!'

His last words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in cities worldwide after officer Daniel Pantaleo was not indicted.  

School district lawyer Patrick Wilson said Fort Bragg officials had changed their decision because they wanted to avoid the cost of a legal battle.

They were also concerned the shirts could cause disruption in the community because it was still mourning the death of a sheriff's deputy who was killed in the line of duty in March.

'The concern is, you are in a packed auditorium, this is a polarizing issue and it's about something that happened in New York,' Wilson said. 

'I think it's fine for people to protest about it, but emotions are still raw in that area.' 

Jone Lemos, whose daughter, Jin Jackson, is a team co-captain said some of the female players and about 100 supporters rallied outside the tournament.

Lemos said: 'I'm so proud of them for becoming involved in these issues.'  

Georgetown basketball team became the first college sports team to stage an 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirt demonstration earlier this month. 

Professional basketball players such as LeBron James, Derrick Rose and Kyrie Irving have also worn 'I Can't Breathe' shirts during warm-ups without repercussions from the NBA.
