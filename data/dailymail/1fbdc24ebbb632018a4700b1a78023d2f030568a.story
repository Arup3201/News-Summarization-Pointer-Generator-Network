Small spotty cats found in Brazil called Oncillas, look identical to those found elsewhere on the continent, but scientists have discovered they belong to a completely different species.

Researchers compared the genes of the wild cats living in the north east of Brazil with nearby populations in the south and discovered there is no flow of genes between the two populations of cats.

The discovery is a reminder of just how little scientists still know about the natural world, and has important conservation implications for the cats, according to the researchers.

The animals that are the subject of the surprising research are around the size of a household moggy and are also known as little spotted cats or tigrinas.

The new study revealed a complicated set of relationships between the creatures (here one from the south is pictured) and two other species of Neotropical cats

They look the same in both of the colonies, despite their genetic makeup.

The scientists, from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, said there has not been any exchange off genes between the two feline communities for millennia, indicating the two populations did not interbreed.

Researcher Eduardo Eizirik, who co-authored the study, which was published in the journal Current Biology, said they are in fact two completely different species.

He said the study ‘illustrates how much is still unknown about the natural world, even in groups that are supposed to be well-characterised, such as cats.

‘In fact, there are many basic aspects that we still don't know about wild cats, from their precise geographic distribution and their diets to even species-level delimitation, as in this case.’

He and his colleagues have named the species in the south as Leopardus guttulus, while the community in the northeast will be known as Leopardus tigrina.

The new study revealed a complicated set of relationships between the tigrinas and two other species of Neotropical cats.

The oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus) is a small spotted cat native to montane and tropical rainforests of Central and South America.

It is active during the night and in twilight and is related to the ocelot.

The creature grows up to 59cm long, with a slender tail.

Oncillas typically weight between one-and-a-half and three kilograms

Their fur is thick and soft, ranging from light brown to dark ochre, with numerous dark rosettes across the back and flanks.

This colouration helps them blend in with the mottled sunlight of the tropical forest understory.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has classified the oncilla as vulnerable.

The
 chief threats to these felines are deforestation and poaching. Oncillas
 are killed for their pelts, which are highly prized and often sold or 
made into clothing.

The scientists believe the north eastern species interbred or chose to breed with another species of pampas cat, which made them genetically different to the southern species, despite looking the same.

Dr Eizirik said the interbreeding may have helped the two oncilla species diverge.

The researchers suggest that the two distinct tigrina species may be suited to different habitats, with the north eastern cats living primarily in savannahs, as well as dry shrub lands and forests and the southern species living in denser and wetter Atlantic forests.

Dr Eizirik said: ‘Such distinct habitat associations provide a hint to potentially adaptive differences between these newly recognized species and may have been involved in their initial evolutionary divergence.’

Scientists are keen to learn more about the rare population of oncillas in north eastern Brazil and whether they need to be protected urgently.

‘All four species are threatened and we need to understand as much as possible regarding their genetics, ecology and evolution to be able to design adequate conservation strategies on their behalf,’ he added.

Much like domestic cats, oncillas catch birds and small mammals to eat and while they primarily live and hunt on the ground, they are adept at scaling trees, Fox News reported.

They are known to be one of the smallest cats living in South America and weigh a maximum of three kilograms.
