The advertising watchdog has launched a formal investigation into Asda’s Christmas TV commercial amid complaints it is sexist and offensive.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it acted after receiving 160 complaints – with more arriving every hour – from both women and men.

Asda was unrepentant yesterday, saying it welcomed the inquiry and intended to carry on showing the advert.

Complaints: The advertising watchdog has launched a formal investigation into Asda's Christmas commercial

The ad features a mother weighed down
 with festive preparations: shopping, picking the tree, writing cards 
and cooking the turkey.

As she exhausts herself, the rest of the family lazes around, being waited on hand and foot.

The commercial pushes home the message with the slogan ‘Behind every great Christmas there’s Mum’.

...Decorates the Christmas tree...

...And shops for festive treats

...All while looking after her young family

It has triggered a backlash on Twitter and the website of campaign group Everyday Sexism, which highlights discrimination.

Justine
 Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, told Marketing Week the ad was the subject
 of more than 1,000 comments on its forums in less than 24 hours.

‘Most
 users are irritated by what they see as a patronising portrayal of an 
outdated version of family life and that the days when men sit around 
demanding their tea are long gone,’ she added.

'Patronising portrayal': Asda's advert showing a stressed-out mum exhausting herself to prepare Christmas has been branded sexist and offensive by critics

Asda has said it will continue to show the advert, and that it did not intend to offend anybody

An
 ASA spokesman said: ‘The general nature (of complaints) is that the ad 
is offensive because it is sexist to both men and women and reinforces 
stereotypes.’

An Asda 
spokesman said: ‘It wasn’t our intention to offend anyone. Our ad 
depicts what many of the mums who shop in Asda tell us they feel.’
