For decades, experts thought that an extinct group of mammals known as anthracobunidae were related to the ancestors of modern elephants and sea cows.

But  fossils believed to belong to a large land mammal that lived 48 million years ago, have led to experts disputing this theory.

The discovery of bones from the ancient creature has led scientists to identify a new branch of mammals closely related to modern horses, rhinos and tapirs.

Two jaws and other bones (pictured) have led scientists to identify a new branch of mammals closely related to modern horses, rhinos and tapirs - known as anthracobunidae - that lived in India and Pakistan about 48 million years ago

The mammals, known as anthracobunidae, lived in India and Pakistan and, until now, were commonly considered to be the ancestors of modern elephants and manatees.

But this idea had puzzled experts from a geographical point of view, as elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from Africa, not Asia.

The new fossils indicate that anthracobunids are in fact related to the tiny tapirs that originated in Asia.

Anthracobunidae are an extinct group of mammals.

They lived some 48 million years ago in what is now India and Pakistan.

For decades, scientists thought they were related to the ancestors of modern elephants and sea cows.

Now experts say they are closely related to modern horses, rhinos and tapirs.

This makes more sense because elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from Africa, not Asia.

However, the smaller tapir is known to have originated in Asia.

Researchers  analysed isotopes and the shape of the bones to find that these animals most likely fed on land and were large and lumbering.

They did however spend a considerable amount of time near water, in a similar way to modern rhinos and tapirs, according to the study, which was published in the journal Plos One.

Dr Lisa Noelle Cooper, of Northeast Ohio Medical University, who led the study, said: ‘Anthracobunids are just one of many lineages of vertebrates that evolved from terrestrial animals, but then left to live in a shallow water habitat and had thick bones.

‘These thick bones probably acted like ballast to counteract body buoyancy. You can see that kind of bone structure in modern hippos, otters, penguins, and cormorants.’

Co-author Erik Seiffert, of Stony Brook University in New York, said: ‘The evidence that has been accumulating from fossils and genes strongly suggests that the ancestor of elephants and sea cows lived in Africa, and at a time when that continent was totally isolated, so anthracobunids’ Asian distribution was hard to explain.’

The previous theory that anthracobunidae were related to elephants had puzzled scientists because elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from Africa, not Asia

It gives anthracobunidae new descendants - elephants, horses and tapirs

Their theory makes sense because the ancient creatures lived in Asia, where tapirs are believed to have originated from
