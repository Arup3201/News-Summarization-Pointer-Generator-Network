A newlywed couple have taken their relationship to new heights after holding their wedding ceremony at the top of an 11,000-foot mountain.

Last August, Brian and Mandy Fabel, from Lander, Wyoming, spent a full 24 hours traveling across the 50 miles from their home to the top of Pingora Peak, one of the Cirque of the Towers mountains.

The bride, 29, and groom, 32, started their wedding day by cycling for 10 miles, which was followed by grueling 25-mile hike, before taking on the tricky final stages of their ascent to the summit.

Kiss the bride: The couple traveled 50 miles to reach the top of Pingora Peak, one of the Cirque of the Towers mountains, over the full 24 hours of their wedding day last August

But despite the wedding’s unique location, the couple stuck to tradition when it came to Mrs Fabel’s wedding dress.

The bride to be donned a simple white dress for the high-altitude ceremony – which she bought for for $8.

Both the bride and the groom said that the 12-minute exchange of vows was just what they had dreamed of and left them sky-high. 

Mrs Fabel said: 'It was completely perfect. 

'We were atop Pingora Peak in the Cirque of the Towers and the views were astounding. The weather was fantastic, and we had the place to ourselves.

'After we returned we heard a lot of "well, it doesn't surprise me in the least", and people were genuinely happy for us.'

The idea for the quirky ceremony came five years ago from the couple’s long-time friend Jamie O'Donnell, but it was only after attending several other weddings during the year that they realized they wanted to go ahead with the unique plan.

During a three-hour car ride back to their home following one of these weddings, the experienced climbers thrashed out the key details of the ceremony – and how they were going to get there. 

Mrs Fabel said: 'We figured there would never be a better time to take on a big objective and have the perseverance to see it through. We've been together for six years and own a house together, so life together feels pretty comfortable.

Top secret: The mountain climbing-mad couple only mentioned their plan to their parents a few days through the wedding

The climb: Mrs Fabel, a charity worker, and Mr Fabel, a director at the Lander Chamber of Commerce, plan to throw a party to celebrate their marriage in July

'We decided that not telling people would help us keep the pressure off. We knew all along we would get married in the mountains and we didn't want people to be disappointed if we didn't reach the top.' 

The climbing-mad couple only mentioned their plan to their parents a few days after the wedding and were only accompanied on their trek by Mr O'Donnell – before being joined by some other friends, who had opted to take an easier route to the peak.

Mr O’Donnell actually signed up for an $8 online marriage license in order to preside over the ceremony, after committing to making the human-powered ascent alongside the loved-up couple.

Friends Kyle Duba and Sam Lightner Jr took a much easier route to the summit and filmed the ceremony.
