The fact that Mykaela Gibson walked out her front door on Tuesday let alone to be the face of an anti violence campaign is nothing short of courageous.

The 44-year-old has been a prisoner in her own home in southern New South Wales ever since being the target of an unprovoked attack by a young woman under the influence of ice almost two years ago.

The mother-of-four has transformed from a happy-go-lucky woman to feeling constantly paranoid and depressed after she was smashed on the side of her face with a schooner glass on February 10, 2013.

Although she is self-conscious of her facial scars - Mykaela's emotional scars run much deeper

However, Mykaela took a huge step outside of her comfort zone when she attended a press conference to be the face of the NSW police summer safety campaign on Tuesday.

'I still can't believe what I did today - I'm so proud of myself,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

'But I don't want anyone else to go through what I have - glass is a deadly weapon.'

Almost two years on, Mykaela still endures constant pain, which she describes as a burning and stabbing sensation, and has to tape her left eye shut every night as it does not close.

'I can't look at myself in the mirror,' she said. 'My kids have to look at me like this every day.' 

But it's not the physical pain that has impacted most on her life but the emotional torment of reliving that fateful day over and over in her head.

'The nightmares I suffer are the worst - I can't describe it,' she said. 'I suffer from depression and I cry a lot - it's really hard to focus sometimes.' 

She has not worked a single day since the horrific incident and doesn't leave the house unless she absolutely must do so.

Mykaela describes herself as 'hyper-vigilant' when she has to go out in public.

'It doesn't matter where I am - I always look behind myself - I'm just not the same anymore.'

She said she was a 'jovial, happy and reliable person' before the attack but 'doesn't look or feel the same anymore'.

The day and time that destroyed her quality of life will be etched in her mind forever - 5.30pm on February 10 in 2013.

Mykaela went to the bar to buy a lazy Sunday afternoon drink for herself and a mate at the Commercial Hotel on Wentworth Street, Port Kembla.

A 22-year-old woman, who was later discovered to be under the influence of ice, threw a schooner glass at the left hand side of Mykaela's face which smashed on impact.

After the horrfying attack Mykaela is calling to have glass banned in all pubs and replaced with plastic

The offender was sentenced to seven and a half years jail and is eligible for parole in August 2017.

'I had never met the woman in my life - I couldn't have told you what she looked like until the sentencing last month - it was totally unprovoked,' Mykaela said.

If there is one message Mykaela would like to get across during the summer safety campaign it is for people to 'think before they act'.

'If you are angry - think clearly and think about the damage you could cause - and not just physically,' she said.

'People need to take responsibility for themselves and the people they're out with.'

'Don't get so drunk or high that you don't have control over your emotions and what you're doing.'
