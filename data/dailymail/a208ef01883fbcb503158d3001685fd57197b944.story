The female relative  who said she was sexually assaulted by accused murderer Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie told court that she didn't want to pursue the allegations.

The young woman, who cannot be named, told NSW Supreme Court on Thursday that she believed he was 'completely innocent' of the alleged murders of five members of the Lin Family and didn't want to destroy her relationship with Mr Xie's wife Kathy.

Mr Xie is accused of murdering his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin,  wife Lily Lin, their young sons Henry and Terry and Lily's sister, Irene Lin with a hammer-like weapon as they slept in the early hours of their North Epping home in Sydney's northwest on July 18, 2009.

The woman told court that in the years leading up to the murders, there had been a number of 'uncomfortable' behaviours with Mr Xie, which he inappropriately touched her.

The court heard the woman texted Mr Xie's solicitor Kara Greiner saying: 'I have information that could potentially change the crown case and destroy part of the defence case.'

But following a meeting with Ms Greiner in May, she had a change of mind and told the lawyer she wouldn't pursue the abuse allegations further.

'I still believe Robert is completely innocent,' the young female texted after the meeting.

'I'm still willing to do everything to help him, everything ... I'm always 100 per cent supporting Robert.'

But days later, she had a further change of heart after speaking to a close friend and a counsellor.

'I thought, what if he really is guilty (of the murders). He is not someone I would want to live with Kathy,' she told the court.

'Because I didn't have enough evidence to make that judgement I can only tell the court what I know.' 

It was reported that the young woman came to live with Mr Xie and his wife in their Epping home, before he allegedly began coming into her room at night, according to Sydney Morning Herald.

'I'm a pretty light sleeper so when he came in, I think I woke up ... but I had my eyes closed,' the young woman said.

'He put his hand under my pyjamas and under my underwear and just kept it there for a few moments ... just above my vagina. Then he got up and left.'

She said she stayed silent about the abuse because she didn't want to 'crush' Xie's wife Kathy.

'I knew it would destroy my relationship with her.'

She said in one incident at Mr Xie's family home, they were sitting on the couch when he began rubbing his hands up and down her thigh.   

When she stood up, he repeated this action on her torso while taking 'longer breaths'.

'I felt it wasn't very right but I wasn't sure what to think,' she said.

After the murders, she told the court that his behaviour intensified.

The first time he allegedly sexually abused her, during one night at his home, she thought she had 'dreamt it'.

'It didn't seem real ... It didn't seem in line with his character,' she said.

'But when it happened again, I knew I wasn't crazy.'

The relative continued: 'It would stop for two weeks or three and I would think, 'Oh God, it's over'... but then it would start again.'

She said she didn't tell anyone about it at the time.

'I think I just felt really embarrassed,' she explained.

The crown has previously alleged Xie's 'sexual desire' for a female relative was one of three motives that drove him to carry out the brutal murders.

Mr Xie has pleaded not guilty to all five counts.

The trial continues
