A civilian employee of the Coast Guard in Alaska was convicted Friday of the 2012 shooting deaths of two of his co-workers at a remote base originally thought to be the work of a bizarrely-tattooed drifter charged in a separate murder.

James Wells, 62, was found guilty of murdering Coast Guardsmen Petty Officer 1st Class James Hopkins and retired Chief Petty Officer Richard Belisle - but his defense team vehemently denied his guilt and tried to blame the murders on another man.

The 15-member federal jury took only six 
hours to reach a verdict after the month-long trial. They found Wells 
guilty of two counts each of first-degree murder, murder of an officer 
or employee of the United States, and possession of a firearm in a crime
 of violence.

Accused killer: Jason 'Eyeball' Barnum was accused of killing an Anchorage police officer only months after Belisle and Hopkins were shot dead

Wells showed no emotion as the verdict was read, according to KTUU, but relatives of his victims burst into tears.

Federal
 prosecutors earlier said they would not seek the death penalty if Wells
 was convicted. His sentencing was set for July 8.

He will likely spend the rest of his life in jail. It is not clear if he plans to appeal.

Investigators revealed during the trial that Wells put 
together an almost-air tight alibi before sneaking on to the base April 
12, 2012 to kill the two men, their bodies were found in the station's rigger shop, where antennas are built and repaired.

Prosecutors contended Wells, a Coast 
Guard civilian technician, resented the growing influence of Belisle and
 Hopkins in the shop where he was a nationally recognized antenna 
expert. They said he meticulously planned an alibi, sneaked onto the 
communications station and gunned them down.

Wells
 made it home after the shooting and called Hopkins' work phone, leaving
 a message saying he would be late for work because of a flat tire, 
officials claimed.

Eyeball

But his defense team argued it was Jason 'Eyeball' Barnum that pulled the trigger.

Barnum, known as 'eyeball' for both 
the tattoo on his right eyeball that has permanently colored the eye 
black and an illustration of an eyeball on his forehead, declined recognizing the names of either 
man while in court with the jury out of the room, according to the 
Anchorage Daily News.

The 38-year-old also refused to answer when asked if he took drugs the day of the murders or whether he killed the two men.

'I don't want to answer that,' he said.

Wells'
 defense team claims the man - currently being held on charges he gunned
 down an Anchorage police officer - took drugs the day of the murders 
and skipped town before being caught. He acknowledged in court being on 
the island during the killings and leaving shortly after.

FBI
 agents talked to Barnum in the months after the double murder while 
making it clear he wasn't a suspect, but he refused to answer any of 
their questions.

Barnum's 
testimony was then sought by the defense team because he was a known 
acquaintance of an ex-con who dated Belisle's teen daughter, according 
to the paper. She admitted to having past drug problems and dating the 
former convict.

Remote: The base is located on Kodiak Island, about 250 miles south of Anchorage

Prosecutors were able to convince the 
judge the already-accused killer had nothing to do with the Kodiak 
murders and would only be brought to the witness stand 'to frighten the 
jury,' according to the paper.

They then proceeded to mount their case against Wells, saying he 
committed the cold-blooded killings because he became jealous of the 
pair's growing influence at the island base.

Hopkins, 41, was an electronics technician from Vergennes, Vermont. Belisle, 51, was a former chief petty officer who continued service to the Coast Guard as a civilian employee at the base about 250 miles south of the state capital Anchorage.

Prosecutors say the flat tire was a ruse to give him a cover story for committing the murders.

Wells told the FBI he started driving to work, detected a soft tire, stopped at a hotel near the Kodiak airport entrance, checked the tire and returned home to change it, authorities said.

Unbeknownst to Wells, a security camera at the nearby Coast Guard main gate recorded his truck heading for the communication station shortly before 7 a.m. and driving in the opposite direction toward his home 34 minutes later.

Wells' wife was out of town the day of the shooting, and her blue SUV was parked at the Kodiak airport. Investigators concluded Wells switched cars, waited for Hopkins to drive by, followed him to the communications station and shot him and Belisle.

Federal public defender Rich Curtner said in his opening statement that Wells suffered from chronic diarrhea following gall bladder surgery and was delayed the morning of the murders because he spent 20 minutes in a bathroom of a commuter airline.

Wells made no mention of using an airport bathroom to the FBI.

Curtner and defense attorney Peter Offenbecher of Seattle contended authorities immediately focused on Wells and ignored other possible suspects, including 'eyeball.' They said prosecutors had no eyewitnesses, no confession, no murder weapon and no physical evidence linking Wells to the homicides.

Wells served eight years in the Navy and 13 with the Coast Guard. Upon discharge in 1990, he was hired as a civilian employee.

Kodiak Island is home to the largest Coast Guard Air Station in the 
Pacific. The double homicide took place 3 miles away at the base's 
communications station, where personnel monitor radio traffic from ships
 and planes.

In an early version of this article, two photographs of Mr James Wells of Ballyfermot Dublin were wrongly published. We would like to make it clear that this Mr Wells has no connection whatsoever with the events or trial in Alaska, which concerned a coastguard technician, also called James Wells. We apologise for the distress caused.
