 

Gable Tostee - the man who is accused of murdering New Zealand woman Warriena Wright - claims he was 'distressed' during his time behind bars in a Queensland prison.

In newly released documents, Tostee said he also held concerns over other prisoners gaining access to his cell.

The 28-year-old was granted bail last month under strict conditions, including not drinking alcohol and is required to live with his parents.

The Gold Coast tradesman wrote in an affidavit he was 'struggling' while he was in custody at Wacol's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre - in Brisbane's west,The Courier Mail reported.

Tostee has social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder which he said was getting worse because of his time in prison.

'I accept that the stress of my situation will exacerbate my symptoms but I am very concerned that as the months pass by, I am becoming more and more distressed and unwell. My memory, concentration and ability to prepare my defence are all deteriorating over time,' he wrote.

Tostee is accused of being responsible for Ms Wright falling off the 14th floor of an apartment building in Surfers Paradise in August after meeting her on dating app Tinder.

In his affidavit, the carpet-layer also told of his strange encounter with a fellow prisoner, who claimed to be a family friend, sneaking his way into his cell.

The accused killer was in protective custody.

'On 9 October 2014 a man gained access to my cell area and told me that he was a "family friend" and had "sorted out special privileges for [me] with the screws [prison guards]",' Tostee wrote.

'This man seemed to have bypassed officers... in getting access to my area despite my telling the officers that I did not want to see him and did not know him.'

Tostee has been in jail since he was charged with Ms Wright's murder. She was killed after falling 14 storeys from a Surfers Paradise apartment building

This comes after another of Tostee's desperate attempts to get out of jail was revealed.

In a handwritten note to police, Tostee apologised for drink driving and admits to 'drowning myself with alcohol'.

The one page letter, obtained by Daily Mail Australia, was penned at Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in a scrappy style with occasional spelling errors and includes an admission by Tostee that 'I have a problem with binge drinking' and that he has put people's lives at risk.

Written on November 11, exactly a week before he was granted bail on strict conditions, Tostee's note specifically apologises for drinking in the early hours of July 27.

Less than two weeks before the 28-year-old allegedly murdered Warriena Wright, who fell to her death from his 14th floor balcony, police detected Tostee at 3am  on the highway across the NSW border.

He was 'travelling at high speed' and when eventually he was stopped, in Queensland, was charged with high range drink driving in an incident Tostee describes in his handwritten note as 'immature and dangerous'.

'I am completely ashamed of myself,' he wrote, 'I ... put the lives of my friends, other road users and yourselves as officers at risk.

'I have disappointed myself and my family who have done their best to raise and support me. Since then I have finally come to accept that I have a problem with binge drinking and I am taking measures ... to deal with my issues in ways that do not involved drowning myself with alcohol.

'My foolish and immature attitude has cost me ... being stopped that night was the wake-up call I needed and I am thankful that it happened before something potentially much worse happened.'

In his latest affidavit, Tostee said he was 'struggling' while behind bars and also told of a strange encounter with a fellow prisoner 

Twelve days later, following an alleged drinking session at his Surfers Paradise apartment, Ms Wright - a 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk - died at 2.20am.

The note was among several court documents filed by Tostee's lawyers to gain freedom on bail while he awaits his murder trial, which is unlikely to proceed before late 2016 to early 2017.

In an affidavit  filed by Tostee in the Queensland Supreme Court, he recalled 'being in a state of panic' during the July police pursuit and that 'I 100% accept I screwed up' and had been 'so reckless'.

He also claimed he was 'wittier' when drinking alcohol and admits he has been a 'danger to the public' while binge drinking since the age of 17. 

Tostee left prison on a $200,000 surety put up by his parents on November 18, three months after he was arrested for Ms Wright's alleged murder.

Other bail conditions include not using the mobile dating app Tinder, and other social media sites including Facebook. 

The US administrators of Tinder are being pushed by Australian authorities to aid their search for more than 50 women from Australia and overseas who were allegedly contacted by Mr Tostee via the app. 

Bail documents indicate that investigators are pursuing statements from the women and have requested data from both Mr Tostee and Ms Wright's Tinder accounts, reported The Australian. 

Recordings made by Tostee on the night he met Ms Wright are being used by police prosecutors and  to build a case against the 28-year-old.
