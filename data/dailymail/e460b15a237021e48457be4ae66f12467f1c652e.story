These eerie photographs show the London Underground as few see it: empty. Social media director James Whatley, 34, has spent six years compiling the collection, which includes Paddington, Baker Street, Piccadilly Circus, Waterloo and many others at their least busy.

‘It was almost accidental if I’m perfectly honest,’ he says. ‘I’ve spent nearly six years capturing these moments and it was only after the first five that I realised I was making a hobby of it. After a while it became a challenge. Whenever I was in a new station, I found myself looking for the parts that might be empty.'

He added: ‘I describe my project as “an absence of occupance” - it’s devoid of the very thing that it was built for. Our London Underground is a permanent timeline of iconic design architecture, and you only really get to see it like that when it is empty.’

This photograph shows an empty Maida Vale station. Sitting on the Bakerloo Line, the station, to the north-west of Paddington, dates back nearly 100 years to 1915

A rare sight: This image, caught by James Whatley, shows Bank-Monument station, which is usually packed with City of London workers during the week

A Northern Line train approaches the platform at Angel. This station, just east of King's Cross St Pancras, is home to the system's longest escalator, which is 60m long

Queen's Park station, pictured in a deserted state here, was originally built on the main line between London and Birmingham. It has been on the Bakerloo Line since 1915 and was recently added to the London Overground

Mr Whatley, who has pictured London Bridge here, which is usually packed with commuters during weekday mornings and evenings, says: 'It's actually relatively easy to photograph the stations completely empty. The commuters of the London Underground move like waves; like tides the crowds come in and out'

Paddington station, seen here, connects to the Circle, District, Bakerloo and Hammersmith & City lines. It also used to be on the Metropolitan Railway and was part of the world's very first underground line, which ran between this station and Farringdon in 1863

Regent's Park, on the Bakerloo Line, is often teaming with tourists, often heading to London Zoo. Not here, as Mr Whatley managed to capture the station empty

Piccadilly Circus is another station caught by Mr Whatley in a sleepy state. 'An empty underground can occur at any point in the day, you just have to look out for it'

This photograph shows Kilburn Park station, which is on the Bakerloo Line

Holborn, on the Piccadilly and Central lines, is another station packed during commuting hours. Mr Whatley says: 'It's interesting seeing or hearing about different tastes, as some people prefer the platforms, and some people prefer the trains'

Maida Vale station pictured from an upper level. Interestingly, when the station opened in 1915, it was entirely staffed by women

Eerie: This photograph shows a deserted corridor on the Waterloo & City line. Linking Waterloo and Bank, the line opened in 1898

Connected on five lines (the Metropolitan, Circle, Jubilee, Bakerloo and Hammersmith & City), Baker Street has ten platforms - more than any other Underground station

This photograph shows Regent's Park. The station, which was opened in March 1906, has no surface buildings and is accessed from a subway

This photograph shows the abandoned Aldwych Underground station. Located on the Strand, the station was on the end of a branch of the Piccadilly Line. It opened in 1907 and closed in 1994

This photograph again shows Baker Street station in an empty state. Opened in 1863, it was one of the stations on the Metropolitan Railway line between Paddington and Farringdon

Pictured again, Baker Street has proved to be one of Mr Whatley's favourite stations. He says: 'It's interesting seeing or hearing about different tastes, as some people prefer the platforms, and some people prefer the trains'
