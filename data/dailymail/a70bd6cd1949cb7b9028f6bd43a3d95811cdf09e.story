A security guard died when his car was hit by a train at a level crossing just days before his retirement, an inquest heard yesterday.

Dennis France, 65, who had not been late for work in 20 years, waited a couple of minutes at the crossing after the barrier stayed down for longer than usual, before deciding to drive around it.

But a train travelling at 100mph struck his car, killing him instantly and pushing his red Peugeot down the line for almost a mile.

Dennis France, 65, was killed instantly when the London-bound train collided with his red Peugeot 306

Mr France, a front of house security officer at Debenhams in Taunton, is believed to have been running late for work on March 21 last year - the day he died

Mr France, who was two days away from his retirement party, was declared dead at the scene.

He had worked at the Debenhams headquarters in Taunton, Somerset, for 20 years and took the same route to work every day. There was no suggestion of suicide and friends said the only possible reason was that he did not want to be late, the inquest in Taunton heard.

Close friend Alison Chedham, 48, said: ‘He was very punctual at work, he was very proud of that fact … To my mind he had never been late for work and he thought he was going to be. He didn’t want to be late, he was a very conscientious man.’

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch told the hearing that Mr France, from Curload, near Stoke St Gregory, Somerset, may have believed the crossing at Athelney had failed after engineering work had affected the timing sequence.

It was estimated the barrier, which consisted of a single pole across half the road on either side, stayed down for a maximum of 103 seconds before the train’s arrival, longer than the usual 29 seconds.

Mr France's retirement party was planned for two days after the horrific crash which claimed his life

The train, which was travelling at around 100mph at the point of impact, was travelling from Exeter St David's

Mr France's car was destroyed in the crash, which happened at around 6.23am - 23 minutes after he woke up

A report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch said Mr France may have believed the crossing had failed after engineering work had affected the timing sequence

The level crossing Mr France drove on to in Athelney, Somerset, lies approximately 10 miles east of Taunton

The train was travelling eastwards towards London Paddington when it hit Mr France's Peugeot 306

The barriers were down for a maximum of 103 seconds, longer than the usual 29 seconds, the report said

Daniel Hembrow, who was driving his green Land Rover in the opposite direction, said: ‘It all happened so quick. 

I heard the impact and saw something large flying through the air. I was later told this was the engine. 

I got out to see if there was anything I could do and when I looked down the track you could just see the train in the distance.’

Train driver William Ashton, who was taking the train from Exeter St David’s to London Paddington, told the court he had seen green lights leading up to the crossing, which assured him it was a clear route.

He added: ‘As the train was approaching the crossing I saw a red car come from my right in front of me.

‘As it moved on to the crossing itself I immediately pushed the brakes into the emergency stop position. Then I saw the train hit the car. 

'I hadn’t seen if anybody was in the car because it all happened so quickly. I was immediately in shock, I honestly couldn’t believe what had happened.’

The train continued down the tracks with its brakes on before it came to a stop after around three quarters of a mile.

Mr France, who was divorced, had moved to the rural village from London to fulfil his dream of country living and kept many chickens, which were his ‘pride and joy’.

He was killed on March 21 last year. The inquest continues.
