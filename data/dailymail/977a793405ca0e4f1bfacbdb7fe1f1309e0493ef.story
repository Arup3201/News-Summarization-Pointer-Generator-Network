It was a bridge too far for this terrified dog who is afraid of heights. 

Video footage captured Bless the dog trying to cross the bridge on the way to Fall Creek Falls in Pikeville, Tennessee, as her legs wobble.

The Devoes family are currently making their way across America in pursuit of an adventure in their trailer home.

Scared: Video footage captured Bless the dog trying to cross the bridge in Tennessee

The family is made up dad Tom, mum Jaime and their children Tyler and Hayley. 

Their pet dog Bless and two cats Jessie and Maggie have also gone along for the ride. 

The family are keeping a blog and uploading footage of their travels on YouTube.

However, despite loving to hike with her owners, Bless didn't enjoy trekking over this suspension bridge. 

The Devoes write on their blog: 'So who leaves behind everything they know to travel the country in a 28 foot trailer? We do. We were your typical ordinary family, with an ordinary life, ordinary jobs, ordinary house, well, you get the idea, ordinary! What we did have was a NOT so ordinary dream.

'We knew there was more for us than the lives we were living and it was time to stop the madness of the day in and day out "so called" living and embark on the adventure of a lifetime.'

'After living our very busy lives with our family as the center of our world, we realized that we had always used our busy lives as somewhat of an excuse - a way to overshadow our ability to do for others. 

'Since we quit our full time jobs and now live in an RV, there is no longer a life full of hussle and bussle, instead only a great opportunity for our family to make a positive difference in the world and hopefully inspire others.'
