TV personality Dr Mehmet Oz has pulled a woman from her crumpled car after a head-on collision - saving her just minutes before the vehicle rolled backwards into a ravine.

His quick thinking on Saturday came three months after he ran to the aid of a British tourist whose foot was severed by a New York City taxi cab that lost control and hurtled towards her.

And that incident occurred just days after Dr Oz, wearing a red superhero cape, was pictured helping a man who collapsed beside him during a 5k run in Salt Lake City, Utah.

On Saturday, the doctor, who said he must have 'bad karma' when he travels because of the number of accidents, rushed to the woman who crashed in lower Bucks County in Philadelphia at 1pm.

He told Philly.com he and his wife had been driving to her parents' home in Philadelphia.

'We were two cars back when the car in
front was making a left-hand turn,' Oz said. 'It's a very dangerous 
intersection. A car crossing the intersection hit the car turning 
head-on. It was like a scene right out of a movie. I thought for sure 
there would be fatalities. Luckily, there were not.'

He said that he jumped out of his seat and ran to the vehicle that had been turning.

'The
door was stuck, so I pried it open. I asked her if she was okay. She 
looked over at me and said, "Oh, Dr Oz". It was surreal to have that 
happen, especially in that setting,' he said.

'I
pulled her from the car because at that point, it was steaming and 
there was oil dripping. It eventually started rolling back down the hill
there and collided with another car before rolling into a deep ravine.'

Other people also ran to help before police and paramedics arrived to assist the drivers.

Quick thinking: In August, Dr Oz ran to the scene of a crash in New York City after a cab driver lost control and hit a British tourist. He poses with plumber David Justino, who also ran to help the victim

Reunion: Dr Oz later welcomed the victim of the crash, Sian Green and Mr Justino on to his show

Levittown Now reported that another witness, volunteer firefighter Chris Simpson, shared a photo on his twitter account of him beside Dr Oz following the crash.

'First on scene to a multi-vehicle multi-injury accident doing patient care side by side with Dr. Oz,' he tweeted on Saturday afternoon.

Tom Stanton, a member of the Newportville Fire Company, witnessed the crash and recalled his surprise at seeing Dr Oz.

'The
cops were in shock at who was there,' Stanton added to Levittown Now. 
'[Dr. Oz] was a personable guy and he talked like he knew everybody.'

But Dr Oz was modest about his heroic 
actions, saying that he hadn't wanted anyone to find out about this 
latest incident because he has been near an unusual number of accidents 
recently.

Instead he 
credited an EMT with running to help despite being nine months pregnant.
He added that a volunteer firefighter had helped to stop traffic so 
they could clear the scene.

Heroic: And just days before, Dr Oz, wearing a superhero cape, helped a runner who collapsed at a 5k race

Thankful: The runner, Ken Roosa, posed with Dr Oz as he recovered in hospital following the incident

Dr Oz also made headlines back in August when he witnessed a cab crashing into 23-year-old tourist Sian Green as she ate a hotdog with a friend near to his Manhattan television studio.

The cab hurtled into her after losing control and her foot was severed in the accident. She required an amputation and now walks using crutches.

His publicist told Philly.com that Dr Oz rushed to the scene, where passersby were already helping, and worked to keep everyone calm while medics arrived.

And just days before that accident, he also helped a man, Ken Roosa, who collapsed next to him at the finish line of a 5K race in Utah due to dehydration and stress.

Race TV footage showed Dr Oz, who hosted the event and was dressed in a red superhero cape, kneeling on the pavement to assist the 53-year-old Ohio man.
