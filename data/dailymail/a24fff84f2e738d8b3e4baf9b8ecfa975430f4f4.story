Dug deep into a mountain which took 26 laborious years to construct at an astronomical cost of more than £3billion, this bunker is an abandoned relic of the former republic of Yugoslavia.

The extensive 920 foot-deep U-shaped complex is dug into a mountain outside Konjic, 25 miles south of Sarajevo in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

Communist Yugoslavia's leader Josip Tito ordered the building of the bunker in 1953 to safeguard the country's ruling classes in case of a nuclear attack. 

The complex, spanning 6,500 square metres, was designed to allow 350 people to live and work for six months without ever coming up for air. It had its own generators, water supply and air-conditioning system.

The existence of this atomic shelter that could withstand a nuclear attack strength of 20 kilotons - far more powerful than ones that were dropped on Hiroshima - was known only to Tito, his closest confidantes and and the handful of soldiers guarding it.

The bunker was finally completed in 1979 - a year before the dictator's death. 

He never got to see the U-shaped complex dug into the mountain with 100 bedrooms and the 'presidential bloc' containing private quarters built just for him with a king-size bed and an en-suite bathroom. 

The secret bunker was revealed when Bosnia broke away from Yugoslavia in 1992. The new army took over and still owns the underground complex, which is now on show to the public.

While Tito was viewed in some quarters as authoritarian, he was widely praised for developing a unique brand of socialism in his beloved Yugoslavia. 

He modelled his country on the Soviet Union, but after falling out with Stalin, chartered an independent course for the country. 

Yugoslavia became far more open than its communist neighbours, such as allowing visitors free travel to the west, and was seen by many as a paradise on earth. 

Tito also managed to maintain the peaceful co-existence of the nations of the six republics of Yugoslavia due to his internal policies. 

Although there was substance to Tito's Yugoslavia, much was illusion too. The economy was propped up by loans from the west and stirrings of discontent in Croatia and Kosovo were swiftly put down. 

Following his death in 1980, the state began to fall apart as the republics began to seek greater powers for themselves and the former federation disintegrated amid bloody fighting.
