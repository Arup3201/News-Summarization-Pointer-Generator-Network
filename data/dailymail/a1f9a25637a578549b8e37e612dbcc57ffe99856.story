A warm-blooded man in Russia is being hailed a 'hero' for plunging into a frozen pond to save a drowning dog.

The thick-skinned swimmer, known only as Ivan, was filmed as he dragged the canine to shore.

Footage shows the shirtless 21-year-old using his arms to smash through the ice to catch the dog. 

The animal bobs just above the surface around ten meters away.

Ivan eventually grabs the animal by its body and makes his way back to dry land.

According to the local Russian news channel m24.ru, Ivan had stopped his car near the pond to help a motorist who had broken down. But as he was talking to the driver, he heard the dog barking for help.

The pup apparently didn't have an owner and Ivan later adopted him, naming him Rex.

The duo now appear to be inseparable. Indeed, as they were interviewed safe and dry at home Rex affectionately wandered around Ivan.

To date the video of Ivan diving into the ice cold pond has attracted more than 130,000 hits.

Many have applauded his actions however, some have highlighted that it could have potentially proved fatal for both parties. 

'I don't think physically I could of done that. Even if I tried,' one viewer mused.

It's believed the incident took place last March in a village outside of Moscow.

The Russian capital is currently experiencing lows of minus 12 Celsius.
