Scotland Yard detectives searching for Madeleine McCann in Portugal have been granted permission to question their prime suspects, it has emerged.

Police identified eight local men earlier this year who they believe could hold the key to solving the mystery of Madeleine’s disappearance.

The suspects, three of whom are convicted drug dealers, were traced from phone records linking them to Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine was last seen alive.

Portuguese authorities were today reported to have finally given the go-ahead for British officers to quiz them.

The development came as officers completed their first week of painstaking searches of scrubland 300 yards from the Ocean Club resort where Madeleine holidayed with her family in May 2007.

Madeleine’s parents Kate, 46, and Gerry, 45, have not travelled to Portugal but are being kept closely informed.

Yesterday, they said they are 'encouraged by the progress'‎ of searches for their missing daughter.

‎Writing on the couple's official Find Madeleine Facebook page, they added: 'Thank you for continuing to stand by us and supporting our efforts to get Madeleine home.'

‎Earlier this year, Britain's most senior police officer said Scotland Yard was closing in on the people who abducted Madeleine McCann.

The area British police have been given permission to search is not far from the apartment where the McCanns were staying. It is understood to have previously been used by local children as a play area

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe confirmed officers have the names of people of interest after the Mail revealed exclusively that three burglars have been identified as the prime suspects in the case.

The men were near to the scene on the night Madeleine went missing and analysis of phone data suggests they were in close contact with each other in the hours that followed.

Sources in Portugal suggested the three men were former employees at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz, where there had been a four-fold increase in burglaries in the months before Madeleine vanished.
