This was the spectacular sight of the Crystal Palace transmitter lighting up the sky last night to commemorate it broadcasting its last analogue signal after 56 years.

The 719ft-high tower shone like a beacon over south London as it marked the end of an era following the biggest digital switchover yet.

The mother of all transmitters, which reaches a fifth of the country's TV sets all by itself, will continue to broadcast signals - but only digital ones from now on.

The 219m tall Crystal Palace broadcast tower is illuminated to mark the switch from analogue to digital television, bringing to an the end the 75 years that the antenna has been broadcasting the analogue signal.

Digital and analogue transmissions both 
use radio waves, except that the former encrypts the signals so that 
only digital receivers can light up our homes with entertainment.

Broadcasting its first TV signal in 1956, the 719ft-high Crystal Palace transmitter has been nicknamed ‘South London’s Eiffel Tower’.

And, despite being in rather less exclusive area than the Paris icon and strictly off-limits to tourists, Crystal Palace has possibly a greater importance than its 1,063ft rival..

Without it a fifth of Britons would have no TV.

There are 1,153 other television transmitters reaching 62 million people, from the Outer Hebrides to Bodmin Moor.

But Crystal Palace is the largest and most important.

It was from here that colour television first took flight in 1967, from here that HD television was transmitted for the first time in 2009.

The tower was built on the ruins of the original Crystal Palace, the Victorian exhibition centre which burned down in 1936.

The first transmission took place on March 28, 1956. It was initially only used experimentally, with the BBC’s main transmitter at Alexandra Palace.

The only terrestrial station in the pre-digital era that is didn’t transmit was Channel 5. But now, using coded UHF signals, it can transmit every digital channel.

Nevertheless, the end of analogue at Crystal Palace, which first transmitted a signal in 1956, marks an important step in our history as modern technology replaces old.

It would be particularly pertinent to the 100,000 homes were left with no television service at all in the switchover because they only had an analogue set.

Second
and third sets which were not digitally connected will also have gone 
blank in households throughout London and the Home Counties.

People will now need to use services such as Freeview, satellite and cable to carry on watching on these sets.

Although there has been a major publicity campaign, there were thousands of calls to the national helpline yesterday.

When
the signal to BBC2 was cut in the capital and surrounding areas earlier
this month, there were about 35,000 calls to the body in charge of the 
process, Digital UK.

Yesterday in the second part of the London switch, BBC1, ITV1, Channel 4 and Channel 5 lost their analogue signal.

An
estimated 12million sets were involved in the switch which took place 
overnight. Freeview viewers were also required to retune their set-top 
boxes and sets.

Some viewers took to Twitter to admit their confusion, while others complained that the retuning had not worked.

One said: ‘Why have I lost BBC1 and BBC2 from Freeview? I thought it was analogue that was getting switched off.’

Millions of viewers also lost access to Ceefax, the world’s first teletext service.

This week’s move marks the largest 
phase of the switchover with not only London but parts of Essex, Kent, 
Surrey, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire also 
included.

Many areas such as the Granada region have already completed the change.

The switchover process began at 
midnight when BBC director general Mark Thompson turned off the switch 
at the Crystal Palace transmitter.

The south London landmark, now 
owned by UK TV broadcast network operator Arqiva, was illuminated last 
night to mark the historic moment with 200,000 watts of lighting.

TV broadcaster Sir David Attenborough 
pressed the red button illuminating the 219 metre high tower in a blaze 
of colour and marking the end of 75 years of analogue TV broadcasting in
the region.

He was joined by television personality 
Professor Brian Cox, radio and TV personality Chris Evans and top 
programme maker Sir Peter Bazalgette at a special ceremony under the 
transmitter, owned by UK TV broadcast network operator, Arqiva.

The guests recalled their greatest ever TV moments with Sir David recalling the 'moment a man walked down a ladder and stepping on to the moon' and Professor Brian Cox treasuring the Apollo 13 splashdown.

Amongst the celebrity guests, former BBC director general Greg Dyke shared his precious TV moment of Geoff Hurst's goal in the 1966 World Cup and his favourite comedy, The Likely Lads.

He said: 'This is a momentous moment in terms of choice of TV. We are all guilty of forgetting the range and quality of television we have in this country and it's all got a lot better with the digital switchover.'

Former Playschool presenter Floella Benjamin recalled the time her stage show in the West End was halted because tennis legend Arthur Ashe was on the brink of beating Jimmy Connors and the show stopped so they could watch the historic moment.

Host Chris Evans quizzed Sir David Attenborough about his 60 years in broadcasting and how he introduced Match of the Day to BBC2, snooker to television with Pot Black, floodlit rugby league and the Old Greywhistle Test.

Professor Brian Cox said: 'TV that's watched by millions of people, so significant fractions such as 10 or 20 percent of the population, is overwhelmingly important.

'The argument that's often made is that in a digital world, with the Internet, you can just choose what you want to watch. But I don't think that's genuine choice really.

'I think that the foundation of choice is that you see things that you wouldn't normally have watched.”
