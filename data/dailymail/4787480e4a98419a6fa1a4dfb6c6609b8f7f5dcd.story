Seen side by side for the first time, this pair of pets look like they could be mother and daughter.

While there is 12 years between them, however, these two dachshunds have identical genes – and are Britain's first cloned dogs.

Scientists took a skin sample from the older dog, Winnie, to help manufacture a genetically identical embryo.

The result, Mini-Winnie, was born in March and was flown to Britain on Saturday after being cared for by experts in South Korea for five months.

Two of a kind: Britain's first clone dog 'minnie winnie' with her 12-year-old genetic mother 'Winnie'

Mini-Winnie's owner Rebecca Smith, from Battersea, won a competition to have her dog reproduced from her DNA in a laboratory in Korea

The cloning process would normally cost £60,000, but owner Rebecca Smith, 29, had it done for free after winning a competition.

At the weekend the puppy met her elderly double for the first time, and while they are not identical – Winnie naturally shows the signs of ageing – the resemblance between the two was clear to see.

Miss Smith said: 'Mini-Winnie looks just like Winnie did when she was a puppy. Big Winnie has put on weight and looks grey now but they have the same markings.

'They both have big ears and nipples which aren't quite aligned. They even both have little bent tails.'

Miss Smith, a caterer from Battersea, South London, was given Winnie as an 18th birthday present and credits the dog with helping her through spells of bulimia and depression. She even plans to have her as a 'bridesmaid' at her wedding next year.

She said: 'I'm really attached to Winnie, she's irreplaceable. But she's getting old, and everyone kept saying we should get another.

Rebecca Smith won a South Korean contest to clone her dog, a technique would usually cost £60,000

The dachshund is the first dog in Britain to be cloned, having been imported from South Korea

'My boyfriend joked that we should get her cloned, but we never thought that would have been possible. Then we entered a competition in a newspaper and ended up winning.'

Scientists at the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation flew Winnie's skin cells to their lab in Seoul in South Korea, where the DNA was extracted and placed into a donor egg.

After fertilisation the egg was inserted into a dog surrogate to develop into an embryo.

Miss Smith travelled to South Korea to witness the birth of Mini-Winnie on March 30. The pup weighed only 1lb at birth and has been kept in quarantine since then.

On Saturday, the dog made the 15-hour flight to London to start a new life with its double.

'It was pretty amazing,' Miss Smith said. 'We put them both on the carpet and they went up to each other and had a little sniff.

'But then the little one tried to eat Winnie's chew and she put her foot down to that.'

She added: 'Their personalities do seem to be slightly different.

'Winnie is very placid and laid-back. She likes to sleep and it's quite hard to make her walk.

Paws for thought: Campaigners have criticised the cloning practice as ethically dubious

The only thing that Miss Smith was unsure about is the temperament and personality of her dog-clone, and she'll have to wait for her pup to grow up to be able to tell

'In contrast, Mini-Winnie is, at the moment, very playful and bouncy and excitable. She loves going out to the park. 

'Mini-Winnie has gone slightly off her food because she's in a new environment, and at the moment will only eat fresh meat.

We keep putting out doggie biscuits for the puppy and then we'll come back and Winnie will be eating them. 

Rebecca chose to clone her dog because of the irreplaceable bond she had to the original hound who saw her through so much of her life

The pup weighed only 1lb at birth and has been kept in quarantine since then

'But one thing they both have in common is they sleep together in my bed every night, and they tend to sleep right through.

'They seem very happy in each other's company.'

Miss Smith plans to have the two dogs follow her down the aisle when she marries fiance Alex Bourne, 30, a businessman – with Winnie as her Maid of Honour.

She added: 'I want her to know how important she is, which is why we've had her cloned.'

Sooam Biotech Research Foundation produced the world's first cloned dog, called Snuppy, in 2005 and has since cloned hundreds more.

Campaigners have criticised the practice as ethically dubious.

Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned mammal, was created at Edinburgh University in 1996 but was plagued by health problems and put down at the age of six.

Miss Smith says Mini-Winnie has been given a clean bill of health and should live to the average age of a dachshund, 15 years.
