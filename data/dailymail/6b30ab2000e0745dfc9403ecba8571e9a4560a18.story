Most newlyweds-to-be save their hard-earned pennies to be able to afford a romantic, once-in-a-lifetime honeymoon in a far-flung destination - and a set of memories they will treasure forever. 

But for one couple, life is quite literally one big honeymoon - because their job is to test out the traditional post-wedding getaway.

David Benton-Jones and his wife Lucy have been on over 40 honeymoons in just 10 years, travelling from the depths of wild Africa to the luxury of the Caribbean experiencing the heights of romance - and all without paying a penny.

Best job in the world: David Benton-Jones and his wife Lucy have the best job in world testing traditional post-wedding getaway going on over 40 in just 10 years

As a pair they organise honeymoons for 
newlyweds and in return the resorts give them commission, free stays and
 the time of their lives.

They get treated to the best the resort can offer, from champagne boat trips to outdoor sleeping experiences with the lions.

David said that on one honeymoon they were woken up by an elephant smashing its way through their kitchen.

David said: 'It’s great fun. We get the very best as they want us to bring in the customers.

'We’re treated like VIPs. We get to experience so much romance and some really exhilarating adventures.'

The couple met at a party in London 
where they decided on setting up their own travel business and David, 
35, said it was ‘love at first sight’.

He said: 'I met her and told her I 
wanted to start a travel company. We had similar interests and a week 
later she flew out to Kenya with me.

'When you’re stranded in the middle of Africa with someone you really get to know that person.

'Our company, Ultimate Honeymoons, was formed and we’ve been inseparable ever since.'

David and Lucy’s own honeymoon was an extravagant three-week vacation in South Africa, Seychelles and Zermatt.

Thanks
 to their fruitful business they were able to stay at the incredible 
North Island, where Will and Kate also went for their honeymoon.

Usually the luxury resort would set you back a whopping £3,500 a night, but for the honeymooners it came at no cost.

Family trip: The couple, who have three children under five, enjoyed having a bush breakfast in Waterberg, South Africa with two of their children

VIP: The couple get treated like VIP's, taking in all the best sights. Here they can be seen riding safari in Zimbabwe

As experts on holidaying, David and Lucy modelled their wedding around their honeymoon, by having it in November.

David said: 'We had our wedding in November because the rest of the world has the best weather during our winter.

'The weather will always be rubbish in England so it doesn’t matter when you have your wedding here.

Fun activities: David enjoys sail-boarding on Lamu island, Kenya while Lucy makes a friend at the Giraffe Manor hotel in Kenya

Only the best: Here Lucy enjoys the breathtaking sea views at the Four Seasons resort Landaa Giravaruu, Maldives, which they recommend as a good destination for couples on a budget

'So you might as well have it at a time when you can have a warm, sunny honeymoon afterwards.

'For us, every day is a honeymoon anyway.'

The lucky duo have honeymooned in 
Seychelles, Mauritius, Maldives, Dubai, Oman, South Africa, Botswana, 
Kenya, Tanzania, Morocco, Zanzibar and Mozambique.
