Extravagant ideas: Gwyneth Paltrow's festive stocking filler list includes a £3,100 juicer

She has already told us how to splash out £300,000 on a new summer wardrobe.

Now Gwyneth Paltrow is urging us to line up a few pricey stocking fillers – and top of her picks is a gold-plated juicer costing £3,100.

The item is on a £69,000 list of festive gifts recommended on her lifestyle website Goop – which has been operating at a loss and is much derided for its extravagant gift ideas that seem only within reach of the super-rich.

Actress Paltrow, 42, who reportedly earns around £12million a year from her movies, urged fans to treat a loved one to the Easy Health Angel Juicer Gold – the world’s first gold-plated juicer – because it is ‘absurd, but awesome’. 

She also recommends a £9,000 diamond-shaped vase from luxury brand Esque and ‘bargains’ including a £4,800 Cartier bracelet and baggage by Valentino for £2,900.

Although she admits the bag is costly, the Hollywood star writes: ‘Yeah right, but how cool is this?’

Her Christmas guide was already attracting derisive comments on social media last night. 

Lynda Swaney wrote on Twitter: ‘Do we need this?...Truly the most ridiculous items!’ 

Paltrow, who also suggests a £900 Hermes blanket and a £367 pair of Golden Goose sneakers for older children, says she has tried to include items for the budget-conscious.

‘We tried to keep as much as possible at the $100 (£62) mark, though there are some splurges for your nearest and dearest,’ she wrote. 

‘Plus, a girl can always dream.’

Despite her upbeat tone, Paltrow is losing money three years after she founded Goop, which she says shares ‘all of life’s positives’ and features recipes, fashion advice and travel tips.

Worth it? While juicing is all the rage nowadays, shelling out on a £3,100 Super Angel juicer in gold may not be everyone's idea of money well spent
