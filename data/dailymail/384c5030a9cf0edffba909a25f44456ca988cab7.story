One in three first-home buyers need their parents to pay for the deposit on their property, with Australians struggling with rising house prices.

The founder of Aussie Home Loans, John Symonds says people looking to buy their first property are “stuffed”.

'Certainly the great Aussie dream is becoming a distant memory, which is unfortunate because it goes right to the fabric of our society,' Mr Symonds told news.com.au

ING Direct research shows that 80 per cent of parents are willing to provide financial aid to their children to help them buy their first homes.

46 per cent are willing to make sacrifices to their own lifestyles to help their children afford a deposit or to allow the children to live at with them while they save for a property.

Aussie Home Loans founder John Symonds says people looking to buy their first home are 'stuffed'

A decade ago, less than 10 per cent of parents helped their children with deposits, whilst 20 years ago it was rare for a parent to assist – as house prices are steadily rising by around 10 per cent a year.

ING Direct spokesman John Arnott told news.com.au that in the last year there has been a 15 per cent increase in the number of first-home buyers that seek loans or contributions from family members.

‘Since the GFC deposits are gifts have taken over first-time buyers relying on equity in their parents’ home to get a loan approved because it’s a lot financially cleaner for the family if things go pear shaped, such defaults on the mortgage or divorce,’ Mr Hill told news.com.au.

One in three parents pay their children's deposit for their first property purchase

Parents jointly shell out $122 million a year, to help fund their children’s first home purchase.

A new law was proposed by Senator Xenophon to allow first home owners to access their superannuation to fund their property purchase.

The independent senator for South Australia proposed the scheme, which would permit the buyer to loan up to $25,000 from their superannuation and repay it over 15 years.
