A cybersecurity executive breached the NASDAQ website in only 10 minutes.

By using any combination of browser history, cookies or phishing attacks, hackers can easily take over the exchange’s website, said a security expert who claims hackers can control the site using basic tools.

Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of High-Bridge Tech, a Switzerland-based technology security firm, detailed to the New York Daily News how he notified NASDAQ of the vulnerability multiple times only to be ignored.

Here a glitch, there a hack: Trading on the NASDAQ Market has been halted in the past for glitches, now the exchange's website has been hacked - in only 10 minutes

A good hacker can get full access to Nasdaq.com in a couple of days with the ability to do almost whatever he wants, such as push an announcement that Facebook shares have dropped 90% [which] could cause havoc on the stock exchange,’ Mr Kolochenko told the Daily News.

Calling it ‘quite frightening,’ Mr Kolochenko boasted to the paper that he was able to hack into Nasdaq.com in only 10 minutes – armed with only the Firefox web browser.

All it was took was inputting random HTML code into the site’s script to see if it would be detected before displaying on the site, he further explained. Once it wasn’t, the security expert knew he had found a problem.

Hackers can use codes to display just about anything on any website, including ‘a fake Web form demanding credit card numbers and other personal information or to inject malware to infect PC users,’ Mr Kolochenko warned.

‘The only limit is the hacker’s imagination,’ said Mr Kolochenko.

Users could also be forwarded to outside
sites maliciously designed to collect information hackers can then use 
to steal unsuspecting people’s information – also known as phishing. 
This information can then be used to commit identity theft.

A NASDAQ spokesperson told the Daily News they had contacted Mr Kolochenko regarding his findings, and explained the exchange takes monitoring its website seriously.

‘We work with leading security vendors and have a trained and professional team that evaluates all credible threats across our digital assets.’

Hacked: Mr Kolochenk hacked the site by entering random HTML code from a web broswer, no special tools were needed

'We responded to his concerns immediately,' a NASDAQ spokesperson told MailOnline. 'We take all information security matters seriously.'

Further explaining that the exchange's information security unit 'addresses any and all vulnerabilities identified,' the spokesperson said that they 'received the security flag and put tickets on it and began addressing it straight away.'

This is only the latest in a recent series of events that have called into question the technology used by exchanges and financial firms.

Trading was halted on all four US options exchanges Monday for over an hour after a technical glitch caused quotes to be inaccurately displayed.

Spectacular failure: Facebook's IPO on Nasdaq was initially a bust, as technology issues delayed trading made a mess of trades for the majority of the day

Trading was halted for over three hours in August after a ‘technical glitch’ made trading unfeaseable. Many experts speculated at the time that it appeared from the outside that NASDAQ was hacked, but the exchange denied the rumors.

In April, the Chicago Board Options Exchange – the world’s largest options exchange – delayed opening four hours as a technical glitch was fixed.  That halt came only days after hackers broke into the website of retail broker Charles Schwab.

Most infamous, though, is the botched May 2012 Facebook initial public offering on NASDAQ. Trading in the IPO, which is supposed to start at market open, was delayed half an hour and then riddled with errors the rest of the day, which the exchange also blamed on software.
