England's ultimate vision for this trip involved a series victory, powerful momentum and answers. Instead, they will arrive home pondering a 3-0 Black-wash, a telling psychological setback and so many lingering questions.

A tour that promised so much eventually left the national team with little to show for their brave efforts. They departed on Sunday in various shattered contingents, minus the results they craved on the scoreboard and in terms of forward planning. England couldn’t emphatically tick the boxes marked ‘present’ or ‘future’.

Stuart Lancaster is renowned for the glass-half-full attitude that he brings to his work, but the head coach was understandably dejected on Sunday. With the World Cup countdown in mind, he and his assistants had desperately hunted the landmark win which would have added clout to the notion that England are re-emerging as a global force in good time for their home tournament next year. Instead, there were three defeats and the last of them was an unseemly rout.

Failure to stop the All Black juggernaut in these parts is no cause for humiliation, given the annual procession of challengers who come here infused with hope, only to retreat with tails between legs. In a historical context, this was progress of sorts. But England also sought sign-posts to guide them on their way to the World Cup and instead they wound up driving into a dense fog.

For now, confusion has won the tussle with clarity. Lancaster and his assistants are seemingly no nearer to knowing the identity of their best line-up. If anything, there is more doubt than there was when the extended squad left home in dribs and drabs. Circumstances have been cruel in conspiring against selection continuity – contributing to the merry-go-round procession of contenders moving in and out of certain positions.

The next time England are in action is November and their next opponents are the same world champions who have tormented them this month. Putting aside the small matter of injury disruption, New Zealand are bound to have a reassuringly familiar look at Twickenham, whereas the make-up of the home side is anyone’s guess.

In summary, the pack is taking shape, but the back-line remains a morass of dilemmas. Lancaster conceded as much as he presented an over-view of the selection out-look. ‘Once you get the front-rowers back, we’ve got more depth there now,’ he said, referring to the absent Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Mako Vunipola and Tom Youngs.

‘Robb Webber has done really well. Matt Mullan and Kieran Brookes have been bonuses on this tour. Second row-wise, I think Ed Slater has pushed his case forward and losing Geoff Parling for the third Test was quite a hammer-blow in hindsight.

‘In the back row, Ben Morgan was a huge positive and Tom Wood again showed consistency at the highest level. With Kvesic’s performance (against the Crusaders) I’m hoping that is going to back itself up next season. We will have Tom Croft back in the equation as well.

‘Going through the backs, there are more decisions still to be made, no doubt about it. Centre-wise, we had a consistent partnership during the Six Nations and they played well. It was a difficult task for Billy Twelvetrees having been out for so long. Brad Barritt was excellent in that Crusaders game so he will come back in the equation. But I would still suggest wing is the position really where… there’s not many Julian Saveas running around!’

The mention of England’s try-scoring 
nemesis was apt. Savea has touched down eight times in four matches 
against his favourite victims. What Lancaster would give for such a 
consistently prolific and powerful attacking weapon. One primary problem
 for the tourists in this series was an inability to match their rivals’
 clinical precision when presented with scoring chances. Another issue 
was lapses in English intensity levels – extending to 10 minutes in 
Auckland, 20 minutes in Dunedin and an entire half at Waikato Stadium on
 Saturday, suggesting they regressed in that regard. 

An 
area of simmering concern is the breakdown, where England simply could 
not compete with the Kiwis in the crucial business of poaching 
turn-overs and denying their rivals quick ball. Chris Robshaw delivered 
an heroic, dominant performance in Auckland, but the management 
continued to highlight the fact that as an open-side, they expect more 
from their captain at the ruck. 

Lancaster pointedly praised
 Robshaw’s nominal under-study, Kvesic, for his display in the mid-week 
win and urged the Gloucester flanker to relentlessly challenge the 
skipper and create a selection conundrum. ‘We need more competition at 
No 7,’ he said. ‘Absolutely. I’m unequivocal in my mind in that regard.

‘Matt
 Kvesic delivered a performance against the Crusaders which was exactly 
the same as the performance he delivered in Argentina a year ago. The 
problem is we’re not seeing that level of performance in a Gloucester 
shirt. I’m hoping he’ll bottle that, the new coaching staff at 
Gloucester will get the best out of him and he’ll remain that consistent
 presence at the breakdown.’

There are other questions up front, but
 an overall sense of making adjustments from a position of strength, 
while the same cannot be said of the situation behind the scrum. At this
 stage, the only apparent certainty is that Owen Farrell remains a man 
apart as the first-choice No 10 and fulcrum of the entire back-line. 
‘Missing Owen is a big loss to your team’s energy,’ said Lancaster of 
the injured Saracen. ‘He is a great leader.’

Mike Brown is surely 
nailed-on in the team for the time being and Manu Tuilagi proved that he
 must be viewed solely as a midfield force of nature, but beyond that 
there is only doubt – about personnel and the finer points of the 
game-plan. Depending on who starts, England are still searching for the 
balance between playing fast-and-loose or falling back on a 
kick-and-bash approach. 

On the whole, there is far greater 
depth now in most positions, with the likes of Anthony Watson and Ed 
Slater among the fringe candidates making a compelling push for World 
Cup inclusion. But on the flip-side, others who came here may not be 
seen again. It will soon be time for clarity to chase confusion out of 
town and for England to start winning these major matches, or they will 
not be happy guests at their own party next year.
