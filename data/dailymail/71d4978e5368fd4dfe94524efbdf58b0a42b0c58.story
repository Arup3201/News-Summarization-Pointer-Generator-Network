A mystery man has left a series of notes dotted around a leafy suburb of London in a quest to trace a woman who he was apparently chatting up before being interrupted by police.

Hopeless romantic 'Rob' left notes entitled 'Desperately Seeking Suzy' plastered on trees and lampposts around Blackheath, south east London. 

In the message, lovelorn Rob tells 'Suzy' that he was enjoying her company 'before the Police turned up' - before assuring the woman that her would-be suitor is 'NOT A NUTTER'.

A mystery man has left a series of notes dotted around Blackheath, south east London, in a quest to trace a woman who he was apparently chatting up 'before the Police turned up'

The note, apparently written by a man called 'Rob', is entitled 'Desperately Seeking Suzy' and makes clear that Rob is 'not a nutter'

Rob then informs Suzy that he will be there in the 'same place' at 4.30pm on Sundays should she want to meet up again.

The notes, which started appearing earlier this week, read: 'Loved talking to you last Sunday before the Police turned up.

'Came back to find you but you'd gone. Will be there, same place, 4.30pm Sundays.

'If you would like to meet. NOT A NUTTER. Just really liked you - Rob.'

Mystery still surrounds the identity of both Rob and Suzy, while the notes have continued to spark confusion and amusement among residents in the London village.

Mark Helm tweeted an image of the sign before writing: 'Intriguing notice on Blackheath - desperately seeking Suzy - NOT A NUTTER - hmm.'

Several Blackheath (pictured) residents have tweeted images of the sign, which have been seen tied to lampposts and trees around the leafy village 

Another user Beco said: 'In Blackheath - Rob's search for Suzy continues and hits desperate measures...' 

Alex Andreou questioned whether Rob's approach was quite right, adding: 'Nothing indicates sanity like asking for a date via a poster containing "NOT A NUTTER" in capitals.' 

While Jack Rich tweeted: 'Err, saw this at traffic lights in #Blackheath this morning. Definitely not a nutter...! #bonkers'. 

Desperately Seeking Susan is a 1985 American comedy starring Madonna.
