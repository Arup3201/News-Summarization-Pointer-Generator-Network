Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is angry with his protege Jose Mourinho for putting unfair pressure on the club’s new teenage signing Luke Shaw.

Van Gaal knows Mourinho tried to hijack Shaw’s £27million summer move to Old Trafford at the eleventh hour and is angry he is now trying to effectively portray the 19-year-old as a money-grabber.

The Dutchman, who gave Mourinho his start in football  management by giving him a first coaching job at Barcelona in 1997, promised to speak privately to the Chelsea manager after his controversial claim that Shaw’s wages would have 'killed' Roman Abramovich.

Just a kid: Mourinho says he didn't want to sign Shaw because of his extraordinary wage demands

In fact, Chelsea were still in the hunt for Shaw on the day that United announced they had got their man and tried desperately to get the young England left-back to change his mind.

A senior source close to the deal confirmed to Sportsmail: ‘They (Chelsea) pushed, very hard. Even up to the final hour.’

The previously close relationship between van Gaal and Mourinho adds extra significance to the row that has broken out.

Mourinho has often sited Van Gaal as his role model and the major reason he was later able to branch out with such spectacular success at Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

And yet the Special One does have a history for falling out with those closest to him.

Sir Bobby Robson, who initially took him to Barcelona as an interpreter, grew distant from Mourinho when he worked in England and Mourinho was noticeable by his absence at Sir Bobby’s memorial service at Durham Cathedral in 2009.

His long-time assistant Andre Villas-Boas also had an argument with Mourinho and the pair weren’t even on speaking terms by the time  AVB managed at Chelsea and Spurs.

United clearly regard Mourinho’s latest comments on Shaw as a case of bad sour grapes.

Chelsea were confident they would be able to sign Shaw as a long-term successor to Ashley Cole because he had supported them as a boy and was settled in the south playing for Southampton.

But Shaw was persuaded by United’s guarantee of being a first-team regular at Old Trafford and Mourinho’s treatment of Cole last season also put a doubt in his mind.

Making his point: Louis van Gaal has revealed he will talk to Jose Mourinho over his claims about Luke Shaw

Chelsea fought back hard to stop 
United getting their man, even up to June 27 when United announced the 
signing, which is why van Gaal believes Mourinho’s latest comments are 
dishonest.

Mourinho gave the impression last week that Chelsea were not serious contenders because of the wages being asked.

‘If
 we pay to a 19-year-old boy what we were being asked for, to sign Luke 
Shaw, we are dead,’ he said. ‘We would have killed our stability with 
financial fair play and killed the stability in our dressing room.’

‘They
 would have been saying, 'How is it possible I play 200 games for this 
club, won this and that, yet a 19-year-old comes here and gets more 
money than I get?’

Van Gaal 
responded to questions about Mourinho's comments by saying: 'I don't 
think I have to discuss things with the media. It is better to discuss 
it with Jose.'

Mourinho has 
since signed Brazilian left-back Filipe Luis from Atletico Madrid for a 
reported £20m though his wages of around £80,000-a-week are 
approximately what Shaw is receiving at United.

Van Gaal has drilled the importance of team ethic into his United players during pre-season training camp in America.

The Dutchman has even stopped seven-a-side practise games when a pass isn’t perfect – even if they reach their intended target.

The
 manager’s point is that for the sake of the team, every pass must be 
made so the receiver is in a comfortable position to play the next pass.

Hence anything hit at the wrong speed or not directed perfectly is no good for the flow of the move.

United
 have signed two players Shaw and Ander Herrera this summer. Van Gaal 
would ideally like three more with Matts Hummels, Thomas Vermaelen and 
Daley Blind being looked at, and Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman a 
target in January.
