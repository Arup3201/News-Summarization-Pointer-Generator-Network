West Ham United co-owner David Gold insists the club want Winston Reid to stay and sign a new contract, despite interest elsewhere.

The centre-back, whose contract is up in the summer, has attracted attention from Arsenal.

But Gold, who was asked by a fan on a Twitter Q&A what the club's stance on the 26-year-old New Zealand international was, said they were in no way 'getting rid' of him.

Gold said: 'We are not 'getting rid' of WR we want him to stay and sign a new, contract. dg' after a fan had asked: 'why are we getting rid of winton reid?'

Reid has impressed at Upton Park since joining from Danish side Midtjylland in 2010, winning 'Hammer of the Year' in 2013.

He has played 90 minutes in 10 of West Ham's 11 Premier League games so far this season, with the club sitting in fourth place.
