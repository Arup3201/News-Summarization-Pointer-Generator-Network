It was thumbs up all round from France on Thursday night as Blaise Matuidi shared an image of himself and team-mates celebrating their 1-0 victory against Spain.

The Paris Saint-Germain midfielder, who had earlier posted a pre-match snap of himself and fellow Les Bleus stars Eliaquim Mangala and Paul Pogba, played 68 minutes as Didier Deschamps' side came out on top at the Stade de France.

Matuidi took his second selfie of the day with Newcastle's Remy Cabella, former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra and Juventus midfielder Pogba.

The 27-year-old posted the photos on his Instagram account, captioning the victors' picture 'on the bus as a family after this beautiful victory'. The family portrait showed Cabella, Pogba, Evra and Matuidi himself smiling for the camera as they gave their  performance a thumbs up.

The two posts, which have so far gained over 24,000 likes, gave fans a chance to praise Deschamps' men after their first game since reaching the World Cup quarter-finals in Brazil.

France controlled the game despite Spain leading the possession statistics. Within 10 minutes Karim Benzema had a go at goal for the hosts as Vicente del Bosque's side took a siesta, failing to achieve a single shot on target.

Recent Chelsea signing Loic Remy was on good form, scoring the winning goal just 16 minutes before the final whistle.
