A vitriolic letter written by the future King Edward VIII in which he branded the French Canadians 'rotten' and 'the completest passengers' during a tour of the country has emerged 96 years later. 

The Prince of Wales - the eldest son of King George V and Queen Mary - could not hide his resentment towards the French Canadians in the private letter he penned on a visit to Quebec. 

In the letter written a few months after World War One to his mistress Freda Dudley Ward, the 25-year-old Edward expresses his disgust at their reluctance to support the British Empire. 

Resentment: The Prince of Wales, pictured in November 1919 during his tour of Canada, criticised the French Canadians in a private letter calling them 'shirkers in everything particularly in war' 

Contempt: The future King Edward VIII scoffed at the French Canadians during his royal tour (pictured here)

Stinging: In the letters, Edward describes the French Canadians as 'mostly a rotten priest-ridden community'

In the recently unearthed letter, he says: ''These bloody French Canadians. 

'The whole thing is a very delicate, imperial and political question which I don't attempt to understand though I do know they are mostly a rotten priest-ridden community, who are the completest passengers and who won't do their bit in anything and of course the war!!'

After catching a train for Toronto he wrote of how he was relieved to be leaving the French Canadians. 

He added: 'They really aren't worth all the trouble I've taken to be out of the way polite to them, as they are shirkers in everything particularly in war as they all voted against conscription.'

The First World War divided Canada, with the French-speaking population accused of not doing enough to fight against the Germans.  

Later on in the letter to the married socialite, the Prince of Wales derided the attractiveness of the local women. 

He described one of his hostesses as 'pompous and interfering'.

Detailing a formal dinner he had attended, he quipped: 'Few of the women are worth dancing with and far less are in any way attractive.' 

At another party at a yacht club, he complained how there were '100 very plain women' there. 

Disgust: Edward said the French Canadians 'really aren't worth all the trouble' as they are 'shirkers, particularly war as they all voted against conscription' - he is pictured here in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1919

French Canadians are a major North American ethnic group and Canadian citizens derived from the descendants of colonists from France who arrived in New France (Canada) in the 17th and 18th centuries. 

When war was declared in 1914, Canada automatically entered as it was part of the British Empire. 

But by 1917 French Canadians only made up 21,000 out of 432,000 men, despite making up one third of the Canadian population.

The French Canadians opposed conscription as they felt that they had no real loyalty to either Britain or France.

The six-page letter was written by the future King to married mother-of-two Mrs Dudley Ward, years before he gave up the throne in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

Then 23, the socialite was married to Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, who apparently turned a blind eye to the affair.

The letter is due to be sold tomorrow by International Autograph Auctions (IAA) at Nottingham Racecourse. It is expected to fetch £1,200 when it goes under the hammer.  

Richard Davie, of IAA, said: 'The Prince of Wales was a very patriotic gentleman and was known for wearing his heart on his sleeve.

'He obviously would have attended lots of dinners and events in Canada and gave very polite and diplomatic speeches but this letter to someone he trusted very much reveals his real innermost thoughts.

'He still clearly felt troubled by the role played by the French Canadians in the Great War, feeling they shirked their responsibilities.

'I am quite sure he intended these thoughts to remain private and never expected them to become public at any time.' 

Edward abdicated in 1936 (pictured addressing the nation) so he could marry American Wallis Simpson 

Edward was an army officer during the First World War. Although as heir to the throne he was prevented from fighting, he made a number of moral-boosting trips to the Western Front and was very popular with the troops.

Edward was the Prince of Wales from 1911 until 1936 when he became King, a reign that only lasted 11 months when he abdicated so he could marry American  Wallis Simpson.

The Prime Minster and many others opposed the union because Wallis had already been divorced once and was in the process of divorcing her second husband, so the King chose to abdicate instead of giving up his lover. 

His younger brother George, who served in the Royal Navy during the war, succeeded Edward as King in 1936, the details of which are popularised in the film 'The King's Speech' starring Colin Firth.
