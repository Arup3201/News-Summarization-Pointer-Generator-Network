Too posh: Listeners have criticised Archers actress Heather Bell

The editor of The Archers has sprung to the defence of actress Heather Bell, who has returned to the role of Clarrie Grundy in the Radio 4 show, amid claims that she is ‘too posh’.

Other listeners posting comments online complain that Ms Bell, 68, sounds like ‘an over-excited Pam Ayres’, while some allege that her accent is ‘wobbly’.

Ms Bell played the character 25 years ago before being replaced by Rosalind Adams.

However, she returned to Ambridge earlier this month.

One Twitter user wrote: ‘They seem to have replaced Clarrie with an over-excited Pam Ayres. I hope she remembers to breathe.’

Such is the criticism aimed at Ms Bell that The Archers’ editor, Vanessa Whitburn, has now released a statement backing the actress.

She said: ‘Many listeners are delighted to hear the original Clarrie again. Heather is doing a terrific job.’
