Google's self-driving cars will be designed to exceed maximum speed limits, in a move to improve safety.

The lead engineer for the project has revealed the vehicles will go 10mph (16km) faster than the speed limit.

The purpose is to avoid the Google car being significantly slower than speeding vehicles around it, which would increase the risk of an accident.

California-based Google's driverless cars, unveiled in June (shown), will be able to speed on roads. This was revealed by lead software engineer Dmitri Dolgov in a test drive. The cars will be capable of going 10 mph (16 km/h) above the speed limit, which will allow them to match the speed of other cars for safer driving

In the US driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver's seat.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September.

Changes to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, which dates back to 1968, are also afoot.

It used to state: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.'

An amendment agreed in May would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'.

A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time.

The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. 

Dmitri Dolgov, the lead software engineer for the project, said research showed that sticking to the speed limit when other cars are speeding can be dangerous.

Therefore, the car’s speed would be altered depending on traffic conditions, Reuters reports.

The same 
radar and camera system used for collision avoidance would be used to 
monitor the speed of other cars and match to them accordingly.

There will be a limit, however, and if another car is dramatically speeding then Google's driverless car will go no faster.

But
 Mr Dolgov did not elaborate on how the feature would work with speed cameras or 
mobile police, and whether it could incur a speeding fine.

Google hopes the autonomous cars will drastically reduce accidents on the roads.

'Thousands and thousands of people are killed in car accidents every year,' said Mr Dolgov.

'This [the car] could change that.'

In June, it was announced that driverless cars would be allowed on British roads in six months.

The UK government will allow the first trials of computer-controlled cars to start in January 2015, as part of a move to update the law to allow driverless cars. Ministers have previously admitted that the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles (press image shown)

The Government will allow the first trials of computer-controlled cars to start in January 2015, as part of a move to update the law to allow driverless cars on UK roads.

Ministers have previously admitted that the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves.

The vehicles work by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s position on an electronic map. 

In June, Google unveiled its computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals. 

Instead, it has buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing the planned route. 

Google says the goal is for the car to ‘shoulder the entire burden of driving’.

The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive.

The car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing.

The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team.

The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles (160 km) before charging.

Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face.

The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians.

In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles.

Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service.

Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.
