Diego Maradona is recognised as one of the best ever footballers but he now appears to be trying his hand at singing.

The 54-year-old's on-off relationship with 24-year-old Rocio Oliva has taken a positive turn as the former Barcelona and Napoli forward was filmed serenading his girlfriend in Dubai.

Maradona's decision to take to the microphone during a product launch comes just two weeks after a video emerged appearing to show the 54-year-old physically assaulting his girlfriend.

Maradona decided to pull the bizarre stunt while on stage in the UAE to promote a sports drink, claiming afterwards it was ‘part of the show’.

Maradona, whose infamous Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, then looks lovingly at Ms Oliva, whom he has been dating on and off since the beginning of last year.

The serenade follows the disturbing 30-second video which allegedly shows Maradona hitting the 24-year-old after becoming upset over her using her mobile phone.

Ms Oliva secretly filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone.'

She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting,' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand.

The video was broadcast on a lunchtime TV programme in Argentina, after which Maradona insisted he had only knocked the phone out of her hands.

He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there.

'I admit I knocked the phone out of Rocio's hands but there's nothing more to it. The situation didn't continue.'

Maradona and Ms Oliva have broken up and reunited several times during the course of their relationship, and the couple were even engaged for a short time before breaking it off.

In May last year Maradona allegedly had a row with her on an airplane that got so heated that fellow business class travellers and air stewardesses allegedly had to step in to try to get him to calm down.

In July this year, Ms Oliva was arrested in Brazil after Maradona accused her of stealing watches and jewellery worth nearly £250,000 from his mansion in Dubai.
