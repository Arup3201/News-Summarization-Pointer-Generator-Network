Being placed in a position of abject fear is an unlikely choice to de-stress.

But one Indonesian centre is now offering snake massages, which they claim help alleviate stress by taking your mind off other day-to-day worries.

While clearly not for everyone, the staff at Jakarta's Bali Heritage Reflexology and Spa may have a point.

Feeling relaxed? People feeling stressed in Jakarta, Indonesia, may be tempted to try this new treatment - snake massages in a Balinese-style spa

The unique form of massage involves pythons being placed on the customer's bare back

The Jakarta spa claims that the fear of feeling moving snakes is said to help alleviate stress by releasing adrenaline

Lying rigid and motionless as several pythons of all shapes, colours and sizes are writhe across your bare back, is quite likely to divert your mind from any concerns to the present moment.

But the science behind the 'relaxation' theory goes against their claims.

The centre says the movement of the snakes and the adrenaline triggered by fear is said to have a positive impact on the customer's metabolism.Â 

However, adrenaline is released when someone is stressed and it has several effects on the body which relaxing spa treatments aim to counter.

While being rigid with fear is likely to take your mind off daily woes, clients may need a traditional massage afterwards to recover

The novel treatment may appeal to snake lovers however, who genuinely enjoy the reptiles' writhing feeling

When faced with a stressful situation, such as being covered in snakes, the body releases the hormone adrenaline, among other chemicals, which increases your heart rate, elevates your blood pressure and boosts energy supplies.

So a 'therapy' that aims to have this effect will only serve to make you feel more wired and on edge as opposed to less relaxed - assuming clients are not accustomed to touching snakes.

There is a chance that after being frozen in fear with muscles tensed for up to an hour, that customers may need a full body massage afterwards, to need out some new knots.

Bizarre: Releasing adrenaline makes people feel on edge as opposed to relaxed, and for most people, touching snakes is likely to have this effect

The spa offers numerous treatments including the snake massage with three pythons

The new treatment has caused quite a stir in the spa

But for those who have a love of snakes, and feel comfortable in their company, perhaps feeling them slither across your bare body might be genuinely relaxing.

Either way, it's an interesting, if not slightly bizarre, idea and appears to be attracting some inquisitive clients.
