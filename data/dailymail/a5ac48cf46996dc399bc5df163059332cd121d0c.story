Racing in petrol-soaked overalls and – with one unfortunate slip - seconds away from a fiery death, it was an age when health and safety hadn’t yet been invented.

The 1960s was also a time when Formula 1’s best might earn in their entire careers what modern stars like Lewis Hamilton make in a month.

Yet for the daredevils behind the wheel, it was a glorious age – because it was the glory that drove them on to keep risking their lives.

Sporting hero: John Surtees was the first racer to win the world championship in motor racing and motor cycling

FI glory days: Drivers had little protection from crashes as they sat in their cockpits

Racing stars: Jennifer Summers (centre), Miss Motor Racing 1966, with drivers, left to right, Jack Brabham, John Surtees, Graham Hill and Jim Clark

Escape: Racing driver Jim Clark crashes during the Daily Mail Race of Champions at Brands Hatch. He walked away unhurt.

John Surtees, the legendary British 
driver who personifies the glamour of the age in these stunning black 
and white images, was just one of a legion of stars whose impossible 
feats make today’s spectacle look much more ordinary.

Winning: John Surtees took the chequered flag at the 1963 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring circuit

The four-times winner of 500cc motorcycle-racing championships went on to claim the F1 crown in 1964.

The 76-year-old remains the only person to have won World Championships on both two and four wheels.

In
an engaging interview with the newly-published Official Formula 1 Opus –
a collector’s edition book costing upwards of £2,000 that charts the 
history of the sport in 1,000 images - he said: ‘When you look at the 
conditions I raced in, it all looks terribly fragile, but at the time, 
you believed you were driving state-of-the-art cars.

‘In hindsight, you realise they were lethal machines.

‘When
I first joined Ferrari, I went to a place like the Nürburgring where 
the car would jump and the chassis would flex so the fuel tank would 
leak in a number of places.

‘In 1963, when I won my first Grand Prix there, the tank had leaked and my overalls were soaked in petrol.

‘But
we lived in a different age. If the fighter pilots of today were put 
into a World War II aircraft, they might have second thoughts about it.

‘But it was a question of what was 
available at the time. For certain, the 1960s were a little more 
dangerous than other decades.

Then and now: John Surtees agrees today that the cars he drove in back in the Sixties were 'lethal'

Meeting: John Surtees, standing, listens as drivers including Jackie Stewart, sitting in striped T-shirt, and Graham Hill in check shirt talk about race issues

Posters: Publicity for the Monaco race in the Eighties and qualifying for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone

‘The cars were technically more efficient than the type of cars that had raced in the Fifties, but the engineering was nowhere near as good.

‘You used bits of Triumph Herald uprights to build Formula 1 cars and that was all a little bit marginal.

‘You had these very small emerging companies coming along and their concepts were more efficient but the safety did not keep up with them.’

Indeed, the 1960s reads like a catalogue of sporting fatalities. No fewer than 14 drivers died in F1 races during the decade.

Despair: A distraught driver leans against the circuit wall after a crash which left his F1 car wrecked

Ready for racing: World champion Nigel Mansell, who won the title in 1992, talks to his colleagues in the pit

Dangers: Dummies were used to test new safety features on F1 cars after injuries to drivers. Fourteen racers died during the Sixties

Medical man on the spot: Professor Sid Watkins was called in by F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone in the late seventies to lead the track side medical team to handle injuries to drivers

None
of this grim irony is lost on Mr Surtees, whose own son Henry was 
killed at age 18 in a freak accident at Brands Hatch during a Formula 2 
race in 2009.

‘I never believed for a moment I would lose my son,’ said Mr Surtees as his red-rimmed eyes welled with tears.

But,
back in the 1960s when drivers faced crashing against concrete walls 
instead of cushioning gravel traps, deaths were accepted as part of 
racing.

All that began to change with the death of Scot Jim Clarke – perhaps the first driver truly to break the sport's heart.

Powerful: F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone and former president of the FIA Max Mosley

Terrible burns: Niki Lauder was given the last rites by a priest after a fireball crash at the Nürburgring in 1976

Nicknamed Gentleman Jim, he was just 32 when, in 1968, his Lotus 48 hit a tree during a minor race and killed him outright.

Killed: The death of Ayrton Senna in the Nineties shocked the racing world

Only the death of Ayrton Senna in 1994 brought a similar sense of devastation to Formula 1 and its millions of followers.

From then on Mr Clarke’s great Scottish friend, rival and one-time flatmate Jackie Stewart dedicated himself to improving safety in motor racing.

Mr Stewart himself quit five years later, sensing that he had pushed his luck as far as he dared.

Also pictured in a Polaroid-style snap in the Official Formula 1 Opus - which is covered by silk-bound clamshell case and is the largest ever record of the sport with more than 852 pages tracing its history – is the scarred face of another racing great, Niki Lauda.

He too diced with death – this time in 1976 – when he survived a horrendous fireball crash at Germany’s Nürburgring.

While battling terrible burns in hospital, the now 63-year-old Austrian was given his last rites by a priest.

‘That stupid priest didn’t say a word to me because he thought I was unconscious and all but dead,’ he told the Formula 1 Opus.

‘I wanted to scream at him, ‘I’m not dead. I’m not f*****g dead yet’. But I couldn’t.’

Incredibly, a year after his near-fatal crash, he went on to win the world championship for the second time.

Even more astonishingly, after retiring in 1977, the racer made a comeback and won the F1 title in 1984.

By this time, there were still characters in the sport, including his French McLaren teammate Alain Prost, who is also pictured in the Formula 1 Opus. He won the title four times.

Yet the simple pursuit of racing glory were bygone days, left behind in the 1960s.

Lauda himself chiefly returned because salaries were soaring and he needed cash to fund his airline business.

Yet an era where sporting heroes are not cut off in their prime is surely worth it and few of the greats from decades past would begrudge them this right… even if it does mean Pussycat Dolls on the track.
