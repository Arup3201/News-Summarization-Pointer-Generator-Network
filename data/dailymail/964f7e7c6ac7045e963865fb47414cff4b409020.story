It's not often you see a member of the Royal family wearing New Look.

Even Kate, who has earned herself the nickname the Discount Duchess thanks of her love of Topshop, Reiss and Zara has never, as far as we know, shopped at New Look. And that makes trendy Beatrice a High Street pioneer.

The cut-price princess hit the streets of London yesterday wearing a £34.99 quilted leather (sorry, pleather) skirt from the bargain High Street store, which she paired with a light shirt, quilted jacket and stacks of envy-inducing accessories.

Cut-price princess: Beatrice wore a £39.99 leather-look skirt from New Look and £49 Carvela shoes for a night out in London at new Mexican restaurant Peyote

Wise party pro Beatrice, 25, wore slipper shoes on her feet - which happen to be both on trend and darn comfortable (because it wouldn't do for a princess to have to walk home barefoot at the end of the night) - and carried a rather nice patent handbag with weighty gold zips.

Her shoes were a pair of royal blue, embroidered slippers, £49 by Carvela at Kurt Geiger - and they were embellished with a festive jewel.

The bargain outfit was a particularly clever choice for Beatrice, who along with her sister Eugenie and parents Sarah Ferguson and father Prince 'Airmiles Andy' Andrew, have long had accusations of money-wasting levelled at them.

The princess, who has been with boyfriend Dave Clark for seven years now, spent the night at new Mexican restaurant Peyote, in central London, and despite leaving at a late hour she still managed to look a million dollars. As did her skirt.

Good work B. 

Style and comfort: Beatrice looked in high spirits as she hit the streets after supper - and onlookers noted some rather natty slippers on her feet too
