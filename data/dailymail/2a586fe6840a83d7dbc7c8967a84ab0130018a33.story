A mother whose daughter disappeared with her husband and young child in the Oklahoma mountains four years ago believes that the family of three was murdered by members of a violent cult.

Authorities say hunters discovered three skeletons last weekend that could be the remains of Sherilyn, Bobby and six-year-old Madyson Jamison - who went missing in 2009 admit rumors of witchcraft and allegations that they had become involved in drugs.

Connie Kokotan said she believes that police know more about her daughter Sherilyn's disappearance than they are letting on - and that the only explanation can be that the three were killed by religious fanatics.

Mystery: Sherilyn Jamison and daughter Madyson, 6, (pictured) vanished, along with father Bobby Jamison in October 2009

Strange behavior: Friends and family members noticed a change in Bobby and Sherilyn Jamison's behavior before they vanished. They lost weight and were seen wandering around their home as if in a trance

Connie Kokotan, Sherilyn's mother, said she think a cult killed her daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter in rural eastern Oklahoma

'Just like I've said from the very beginning, I think somebody killed them,' she told the Oklahoman newspaper.

'There's just no way that Bobby and Sherilyn would ever let anything happen to Madyson unless something had been done to them.'

The
 family went missing in while they were looking to buy property in the 
remote Sans Bois Mountains near Kinta, Oklahoma - about 155 miles east 
of Oklahoma City.

'That
 part of Oklahoma is known for that - cults and stuff like that - from 
what I've been told and from what I've read,' Ms Kokotan said.

She did not say which cult she believed responsible for the deaths.

Authorities say the skeletons found on Saturday appear to be two adults and a child. They were discovered just three miles from where police found the Jamison family's abandoned pickup truck in 2009.

Forensic
 scientists are currently trying to confirm a positive the 
identification of the skeletons through dental records and DNA matched 
with family members.

Mystery: This is the Jamisons' pickup truck, which was found abandoned in the mountains eight days after the family was last seen

There
 is only one survivor from the family's 2009 disappearance - the 
family's dog Maizy. She was found barely alive in the family's pickup 
truck - having survived by eating her own feces.

'Maizy survived. She lives with Bobby's mom now. Madyson loved that dog so much,' Ms Kokotan revealed. 

Ms Kokotan dismissed claims from the sheriff at the time that Bobby and Sherilyn were on drugs. 

She
 said her daughter's strange behavior can be explained by the fact that 
her sister, Ms Kokotan's daughter Marla, had died in a freak accident 
two years earlier.

She also said that she didn't believe the family was involved in witchcraft.

Remote: The skeletons were found in a remote area of the mountains in rural Oklahoma, about 155 miles east of Oklahoma City

Missing: Authorities at the time were especially fearful for little Madyson's safety - prompting a massive search effort with hundreds of volunteers. The family was never found

They lived in Eufaula, but had been looking to buy property 35 miles away in the mountains.

At their home, investigators found a shipping container that had bizarre messages scrawled across it, including '3 cats killed to date buy people in this area … Witches don’t like there black cat killed' (sic).

Their pastor, Gary Brandon, told detectives that the family had been involved in 'spiritual warfare.' Both Mr and Mrs Jamison had told him they had seen spirits at their Eufaula home.

Mrs Jamison said the spirits of a long-dead family lived with them and that their daughter Madyson spoke with the youngest spirit.

At one point, Mr Jamison asked his pastor whether he could obtain 'special bullets' to shoot the spirits.

He later said he had consulted the 'satanic Bible' to find a cure to the spirits.

Witchcraft: Both Mr and Mrs Jamison had talked about seeing 'spirits' at their home prior to their disappearance

Friends reported that the family had begun acting strangely and that both Mr and Mrs Jamison had lost a large amount of weight before they disappeared.

The sheriff at the time concluded that the family had likely become involved in drugs - though no evidence of this was ever found.

After they disappeared, a massive search effort was mobilized that included hundreds of volunteers, troopers from the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol and agents from both the FBI and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.

Searchers combed the area on foot, on ATV and on horseback, but found nothing.

Sixteen teams of dogs fanned out, but found nothing.

Current Sheriff Jesse James said that the location of the skeletons could have been missed by rescuers are the family's bodies could have been covered in leaves that had fallen from the tree.
