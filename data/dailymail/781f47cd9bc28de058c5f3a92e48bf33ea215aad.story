Rory McIlroy's early difficulties in his opening round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on Thursday could best be summed up by the precarious lie facing him on his 12th hole.

After another poor tee shot in an increasingly erratic driving display had left his ball stationed just above a fairway bunker, McIlroy found himself with one foot positioned in the sand and the other outside, with his body tilted at a sharp angle.

Already four strokes behind his playing partner Rickie Fowler, who was striking the ball with impressive fluency, he appeared destined to fall still further adrift. As McIlroy said later: ‘It was obviously a stroke I rarely practise, and so I was just relying on feel and instinct in the hope of getting the ball somewhere close to the green.’

While it would be stretching things to say what happened next was an early candidate for shot of the year, there will certainly not be many better played this month.

Hooding the clubface (keeping the clubface more upright to make the ball travel lower and further), McIlroy somehow managed to cover the 100-or-so yards separating him from the green so effectively he finished 12 feet from the hole. Instead of the likely bogey to dampen his enthusiasm further, he rapped home the birdie putt.

That was all it took to shake off the early sloth. He went on one of those thrilling rampages that became so familiar last summer. By the time he finished he had gone from level par after 11 to signing for a 67 after registering four more birdies in the sequence, to leave him three strokes off the pace set by course specialist Martin Kaymer.

What must Fowler have been thinking? One minute there was clear daylight between himself and McIlroy and for once it was Fowler who was pressing ahead. 

McIlroy believes he has 'unfinished business' at this event which he has never won after seven appearances

By the close, the personable American didn’t even have the small satisfaction of a one-shot ‘victory’ over his friendly rival after dropping his only stroke on his final hole for a 67 of his own. Asked about the rivalry afterwards, Fowler grinned and said: ‘There’s just no getting rid of him or shaking him off, is there?’

He knows, however, it’s not all bad news. ‘Rory is comfortably the best golfer in the world and so if I’m playing alongside him all the time, I must be doing something right,’ he added.

Actually, he’s doing plenty right, as he continued from where he left off last year to make his debut round in the Middle East a notable one.

Fowler acknowledged afterwards that watching McIlroy progress to become the complete player while embracing a global schedule had fuelled his own ambition to pursue a similar itinerary.

‘I like travelling and seeing different cultures anyway but I definitely think a further plus is that it helps you become a more rounded golfer,’ said the 26-year-old. As for McIlroy, he was ‘delighted with the score but less than pleased with how I arrived at it’. 

Thomas Pieters had a dream round and led in the clubhouse until Martin Kaymer came in one better

Accordingly, after lunch he was to be found on the practice ground, ironing out what will surely prove to be merely early-season kinks with his driver. For the rest, it must be ominous that even when he has a rare bad day with his most potent weapon, his short game rescues him to the extent he still shoots five under par.

US Open champion Kaymer, three times a winner of this event, again showed his liking for these parts with a round featuring no fewer than 10 birdies.

Not only is he defending one major this year, but two more will be held on courses where the formidable German has won in the past. ‘I don’t want to put any extra pressure on myself but yes, it clearly has the potential to be a big season,’ he said. Kaymer holds a one-stroke lead over the promising 22-year-old Belgian Thomas Pieters but Henrik Stenson, who signed off last year with a victory in neighbouring Dubai, could only manage a 76.

Justin Rose spoiled a good front nine with a flurry of bogeys for a 73, while a tip of the hat to Englishman Tyrrell Hatton, who came to prominence last year while being the only other player after Robert Rock not to wear any headgear.

This season, the 23-year-old from High Wycombe has given in to financial temptation, and took to the course wearing a cap emblazoned with the name of his new sponsor. He breezed round in a fine 66.

Another happy young Englishman was Tom Lewis from Welwyn. He had a hole in one at the seventh during his 69 to win a £50,000 Cadillac.
