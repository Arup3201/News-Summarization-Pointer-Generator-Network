Jailed: Paedophile Kenneth Trotter, pictured, was thrown out of Australia after he was jailed for rape. He is back behind bars in Britain for deliberately moving to Blackpool to prey on more children

A 'sadistic' paedophile who was deported from Australia after he was jailed for rape was back behind bars in Britain today for deliberately moving to a seaside town to prey on more children.

Kenneth Trotter, 77, who left the UK in the 50s, had been ordered back to England by a judge in Melbourne after he was jailed for 12 years in 1994 for abusing youngsters at his flat.

But after landing in London last year, he decided to settle in Blackpool, Lancashire, because he knew there would be lots of children there - either on holiday with their family or living in the town.

Despite being monitored by police Trotter soon 'disappeared' from a house where he was staying which turned out to be 
the address of a charity.

When Trotter was eventually traced three weeks later it emerged he had gone to a church group offering teenage girls the chance to work for him canvassing his skills as a sewing machine repairer on a door to door basis.

He also offered the Methodist Church youngsters a place in a home he said he was buying.

Lancashire Police obtained a Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from employing any children and also having no contact with youngsters unless in the presence of an approved adult.

Upon being served with the order, Trotter told magistrates he would prefer go to prison.

He shouted at the bench: 'I would rather go to jail now....I have to go to prison.'

He then booked himself into a hotel asked if there were any children living there.

He also returned four times to the home of a mother-of-four, in the hope he would find one of her children home alone.

At Preston Crown Court Trotter denied breaching the sex offender order claiming it 'breached his human rights' as he had to tell police where he was living.

But he was convicted and jailed for three years.

Passing sentence Judge Graham Knowles QC told him: 'You Trotter, in my view, are an exceptionally dangerous man with nothing to lose.

The seaside resort of Blackpool where Preston Crown Court heard the 'sadistic' 77-year-old had moved to because there was a high concentration of vulnerable children

'You deliberately and flagrantly breached this order by a pre-meditated and wilful act of defiance.

'When you landed at Heathrow Airport you presented a very obvious and major problem to authorities.

'You said you were going to live in Blackpool - the reason, I'm sure, as you know is that Blackpool would have a large number of children present - holiday makers and families - and a high concentration of vulnerable children and young people.

- Judge Graham Knowles QC

'The police were gravely concerned yet you soon decided that you'd had enough of being controlled and the police knowing where you were.

'You gave them a new and false address and the consequences was that the police had no idea where you were.

'I am sure that you deliberately gave the police a false address - the reason is that you wanted to commit further sexual offences to children and young children.

'Some of your Australian convictions arose when you ran a similar business to use it as an opportunity to meet boys and to have boys living with you.

'Police take the view that what you were doing on the streets of Blackpool appear to mirror your offences in Australia.'

Trotter who left the UK in the 1950s used his dual citizenship to live in a flat in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda and took over a sewing machine repair business from another Briton in 1974.

But he was arrested in 1993 after boys aged between ten and 15 claimed he had sexually assaulted them between 1980 and 1993.

A court in Australia was later told he
 had persuaded the parents of some young boys to let them work for him, 
canvassing suburban homes for sewing machine repairs, and to stay 
overnight at his flat a few times a week.

Trotter has been jailed for three years. In his defence he had denied breaching a sex offender order claiming it 'breached his human rights' as he had to tell police where he was living

Police who raided his property found child pornographic literature, photographs and films at the flat.

Australian
 prosecutors said Trotter's business was 'no more than a front' used by 
him to lure the boys to his flat for his sexual gratification.

Trotter
 was initially found guilty of 16 sex charges including indecent assault
 and buggery and was jailed for 12 years in 1994.

But
 two years later he faced another trial in Melbourne after another 
victim came forward to say he was abused in 1980 when he was just 11.

During the second trial Trotter denied all the offences and represented himself cross examining the victim in the witness box.

It sparked calls for a change on the law in Australia about defendants being able to cross examine witnesses themselves.

Trotter was ordered to serve at least nine years in an Australian jail before paroled in 2008.

Trotter spent 18 years in custody in total and when jailed for the final time, a judge in New South 
Wales called him a 'sadistic, callous and most heartless human being'.

He was sent back to the UK last year.

He
 registered himself as staying at the address of a Blackpool charity but
 last June when police tried to trace him the charity had never heard of
 him and a nationwide manhunt began for him.

He was arrested three weeks later in Blackpool town centre.

The court heard Trotter had been going to a centre at North Shore Methodist Church where he pretended to have been sent from the Jobcentre to offer employment to girls aged 14 and over to work as canvassers for him.

He said girls aged over 16 could live at a house he was buying in Blackpool and he also set up a door-to-door sewing machine repair business.

He repeatedly went to one house where two young girls lived four times - despite being told their household did not have a sewing machine.

Trotter, who defended himself told the hearing: 'Every address I went to the police effectively had me illegally evicted.

'They would be visiting every day and the landlords asked me to leave because they didn't want the police coming.'

'It meant that I would have to live on the streets.

'I was forced to spend the night sheltering under the window of a disused house in the rain.

'It was a matter of life and death as far as I was concerned. I didn't think I was breaking any law- I had a reasonable excuse. The order that was put against me was an impossibility.'

The lifetime Sexual offences prevention order will remain in place and it means Trotter cannot live anywhere in England and Wales without the premises being vetted by specialist sex crime officers first.

Trotter is the latest in a line of 
British-born criminals who have been deported here after being jailed in
 Australia for serious offences.

More than 3,200 foreign criminals, failed asylum seekers and EU 'benefit tourists' are using the Human Rights Act to thwart their removal from the UK.
