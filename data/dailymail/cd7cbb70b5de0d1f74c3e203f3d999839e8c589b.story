The sub-zero temperatures and biting Siberian winds didn't seem to deter locals and adventurous tourists from taking a dip in the freezing waters of China's Songhua River during an annual festival.

The race took place in a 'pool' that was carved out of ice in the northern city of Harbin.

More than 700 enthusiasts from 49 amateur groups braved the icy waters to compete in a two-day ice swimming competition.

Winter swimming is enjoyed across the north of the country, mainly by middle-aged and elderly people who either believe it benefits their health or simply enjoy the way it feels.

Swimmers break a hole in a frozen river surface and jump in, using sticks and brooms to sweep ice off the surface as it forms.

Like any major swimming event, these contests were organised by age and gender.

Contestants try to be the first to make it across the 80ft pool in temperatures colder than -17C.

Most of the participants swam for about a minute before getting out.

'I took part in the ice swimming contest to challenge myself. I feel very relaxed after going for a swim,' said 35-year-old Yang Jie from eastern Anhui province, who took up the sport two years ago.

'I don't feel cold at all. People's enthusiasm affected me and brought me joy. I feel very happy that so many people support and like ice swimming,' said 45-year-old Harbin resident Cui Shuxian.

Many onlookers were amazed by what they saw.

'I don't have the courage to go in there and swim, so I really admire them, admire their perseverance and their willpower to challenge themselves,' said 50-year-old Gao Chiming from Anhui.

The swimming competition is part of Harbin's annual ice and snow festival, which also kicked off on Monday.

Harbin's ice festival, which is now in its 31st year, lasts until snow starts to melt in February, and is said to draw several million tourists each year.
