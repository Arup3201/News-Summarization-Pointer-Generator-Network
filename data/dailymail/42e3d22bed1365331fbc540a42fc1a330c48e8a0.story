Apple is said to be so confident its upcoming iPhone 6 will be a success, it is rumoured to have ordered 80 million handsets by the end of the year.

If true, this would be the largest initial production run of iPhones – up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S and 5C last year.

Suppliers claim the Californian firm has asked for between 70 and 80 million units combined for the rumoured 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s by 30 December.

Suppliers claim Apple has ordered between 70 and 80 million units combined for its rumoured, upcoming 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s (leaked images pictured) by 30 December. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets

Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures.

As
 the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced 
using diamond-coated saws.

These round disks are ground into shape, and 
polished, to become glass.

The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant.

Apple already uses sapphire crystal in 
the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera.

As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones.

The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the new gadgets.

The 4.7-inch iPhone is
 expected to go into production next week, with the larger 5.5inch version 
set to start three weeks later.

Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display.

By increasing the size of its iPhone 6 handsets, Apple phones will be closer in size to those made by rival Samsung and HTC.

Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal
 display.

Current models have a separate touchscreen layer.

Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal, rather than glass.

Due to the complex nature of these screens, reports claim Apple could even ask component makers to prepare for 120 million displays, to account for any faults and replacements that need to be issued.

The Economic Daily said earlier this week Foxconn finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff.

The report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger 'phablet' sized iPhone 6 won't ship until 2015.

This figure is up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S (pictured) and 5C last year. Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display.

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up
 until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest 
phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 
millimetres).

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). 

By
 comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 
millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches 
(7.5 millimetres).

Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres).

A
 YouTube videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the sapphire screens - and has
 subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and 
keys to bending and twisting it.

In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed, raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple.

Marques
 Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claims to have got the screen from 
well known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video 
showcasing the screen.

In the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen.

'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said.

'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.'

The
 glass is also extremely high-quality, Brownlee noted: 'There’s 
absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass.'

Apple
 already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and
 camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front 
display is made of Gorilla Glass.

Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display. Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of strong and resilient sapphire crystal - shown here being stabbed with a knife

IDozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6.

They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back.

However,
 a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product 
will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen.

Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone
