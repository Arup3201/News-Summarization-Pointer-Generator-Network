One in four NHS hospital trusts is failing to offer safe, good-quality care to all its patients, a damning report has shown.

Out of 161 trusts in England, 44 have now been labelled as ‘high risk’, with serious concerns raised about their performance.

Shockingly, a number of the hospitals now marked out as risky were classified ‘safe’ as recently as earlier this year.

Care: Labour said David Cameron should be 'ashamed' that' after three and a half years of the coalition one in four hospitals are at risk of poor performance. The Prime Minister is pictured visiting Salford Hospital, which is in the second highest band

Some of the hospitals have been 
flagged up because of high death rates while others have been identified
because of frequent ‘never events’ – serious incidents that should 
never occur in hospitals, such as amputating the wrong limb.

Risk
factors that have also been taken into consideration include poor 
safety measures, low staffing levels, lengthy waiting times, high levels
of superbugs or very low levels of patient satisfaction.

Let down: Schoolgirl Amie Miller

Yesterday’s
report came after health watchdog the Care Quality Commission examined 
161 acute trusts across England against more than 150 indicators, giving
each one a risk score.

The analysis will act as a screening tool to 
identify which trusts need the most rapid inspections.

This
new approach has shown that three times as many hospitals as previously
thought are actually failing, with 24 in the highest possible band of 
risk and 44 trusts in the top two bands.

One
of the failing hospitals was criticised earlier this year for not 
carrying out simple tests on a schoolgirl who later died from a brain 
condition.

Amie Miller, 15, was taken to Basildon Hospital in November 2008 complaining of a headache.

She
died three days later after a catalogue of errors at the risky 
hospital. An inquest heard there were several missed opportunities to 
save her life.

Yesterday 
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the CQC’s tougher stance, but 
insisted that the failings exposed by the review were the result of 
‘problems stretching back many years’.

He
said: ‘Sadly, under the last government, a lack of transparency about 
poor care meant problems went unchecked for too long, sometimes with 
tragic consequences for patients.

‘The
CQC’s new tough and transparent approach to hospital standards is 
exactly what our NHS needs. The information released today is not new in
many cases, several of these hospitals have had serious problems 
stretching back for many years.

Alert: University Hospital, Aintree in Liverpool is placed in Band 1, at high risk on whistleblowing alerts and mortality rates

Mothers: Northampton General Hospital, placed in Band 1, is at high risk on c-sections in maternity care, mortality data and whistleblowers

Inspector: Professor Mike Richards said the new bands would highlight where there is a risk that people might not be receiving' safe, effective, high quality care'

‘The
difference now is that this Government is being transparent with this 
information and honest with the public about the quality of care at 
their local hospitals, as well as taking tough action where standards 
aren’t up to scratch.’

Peter
Walsh, chief executive of charity Action Against Medical Accidents, 
said: ‘The results may be worrying, but we very much welcome the more 
proactive approach by CQC which is more likely to identify dangerous 
trusts.

‘What we most need now is action to put things right – before more patients are needlessly harmed.’

Katherine
Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said the report 
was ‘hugely worrying’ but matched the complaints they had received which
suggested poor care was widespread in the NHS.

However
Labour’s health spokesman Jamie Reed blamed the problems on a lack of 
frontline cash, criticising the Government for spending money on 
reorganisation.

He said: 
‘Hospitals were left on a financial knife-edge and they are clearly 
struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three 
years of chaos.

‘Almost 
6,000 nursing jobs have been axed since the election and David Cameron 
presided over the first summer A&E crisis in living memory.’

But
a Department of Health spokesman defended the new inspection regime, 
saying: ‘Following the Francis Inquiry, the CQC has introduced radical 
changes to hospital inspections.

‘A
new chief inspector, Sir Mike Richards, is leading significantly larger
inspection teams which are headed up by clinical and other experts. 
This next step will help to give the CQC a good picture of risk within 
trusts.’

They added: 
‘Patient safety should be the first in everything the NHS does and we 
expect the CQC to act where it finds failings of care.’

Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust is at high risk on whistleblowing, knee replacement and hernia surgery, A&E waiting times and poor patient experience

in England in one of six ‘risk’ bands.
