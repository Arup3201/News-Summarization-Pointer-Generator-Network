The world’s most wanted female terrorist has fled to Syria, it was revealed last night – as police admitted they stopped surveillance on her deadly Parisian cell six months ago because they were deemed ‘low-risk’.

Hayat Boumeddiene, the widow of one of the gunmen who massacred 17 civilians in the French capital – is now thought to be with her murderous Islamic State allies after fleeing the country. Official sources in Paris said that 24-hour scrutiny of members of her terror cell had been dropped to focus on other targets.

Last night, Boumeddiene, 26, was branded ‘armed and dangerous’ by France’s top policeman Jean-Marc Falcone, who said she was believed to have helped plan the attacks.

As long as five years ago she was pictured in full Islamic dress and using a lethal crossbow in the French countryside where she met jihadi recruiters. She and the three Paris killers were all known to the security services. Yet despite their fanatical hatred of the West and access to weapons, police decided to stop tracking them in July 2014.

It has emerged that hundreds of phone calls between Boumeddiene and Izzana Hamyd, wife of Cherif Kouachi, have shown up on mobile records. Five hundred in all were made last year. 

Boumeddiene was reported to have flown from Madrid to Istanbul on January 2, crossing the Turkish border into Syria on Thursday.

This was the day after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, murdered 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. It was also the day her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, murdered a female police officer before shooting four hostages at a kosher delicatessen in Eastern Paris. The suggestion is that Boumeddiene knew the attacks were due to take place and fled. 

French police named the hostage taker as Amedy Coulibaly, left, 32, but Boumeddiene, right, 26, is not thought to have been at his side at the time

Her husband and the Kouachi brothers were all gunned down by police commandos at the end of two sieges on Friday. Last night, as France remained on high alert, extraordinary stories of courage emerged from those caught up in the deadly attacks:

- A heroic customer at the kosher deli grabbed one of Coulibaly’s guns – but paid with his life after the weapon jammed

- A Muslim worker at the shop helped Jewish customers hide from the terrorist, in what was hailed as an inspiring act of bravery

- A father told how he and his three-year-old son had tried to hide from Coulibaly in the store basement, but was forced to follow the gunman’s orders until police launched their raid, killing the terrorist in a hail of bullets as he ran out of the shop’s doors

- A hostage revealed how he bandaged a neck wound suffered by Charlie Hebdo murderer Said Kouachi, after the brothers took shelter at his printing works

Special forces stormed the Jewish grocery to the east of Paris where terrorist Amedey Coulibaly had taken at least seven people hostage

Hostages - who had been held for hours with Coulibaly threatening to kill them - flee from the shop

Meanwhile, the family of a Muslim police officer shot dead by the brothers described them as ‘madmen’ with no religion.

Up to a million people, including David Cameron and other world leaders, are expected to join a march for peace and unity in Paris today. Counter-terrorism ministers including Home Secretary Theresa May will also meet to discuss the West’s response to the growing threat of Islamist violence.

In London, landmarks including Tower Bridge and Trafalgar Square will display the colours of the French flag to show solidarity.

Security patrols were also being stepped up across London amid increased fears of attacks on Jewish communities. And Scotland Yard is asking travellers returning to Britain from France if they saw ‘any suspicious activity’ while away.

Boumeddiene and her co-conspirators were put under phone, internet and physical surveillance at the end of 2011, when Said Kouachi returned from Yemen, where he trained with Al Qaeda. There he met Anwar Al-Awlaki, a terrorist mastermind later killed in a US drone strike.

‘But between that date and the summer of 2014, nothing suggested any connection with a radical Islamist movement,’ said a Paris judicial source. ‘So the surveillance was stopped in order to refocus on other individuals who at that moment presented a higher risk.’

From bikini beach girl... to jihadi with her crossbow

Wearing a skimpy bikini as she embraces her muscular boyfriend, she looks like any other attractive young beachgoer on the French Riviera.

But the once-glamorous Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, is now the most wanted female terrorist suspect in the world. She is reported to have fled to Syria before her 32-year-old husband Amedy Coulibaly – the smiling young man in the picture – murdered four Jews in a Paris deli.

There were suggestions yesterday that Boumeddiene had helped her husband, along with fellow terrorists Said and Cherif Kouachi, compile an arsenal of weapons which Paris prosecutors said included two Russian-made Tokarev machine pistols, commercial explosives and hunting knives.

It is thought that the firearms were smuggled from the Balkans into Europe, and then into France by car – something a single woman is likely to have been able to get away with far easier than men.

As detectives try to learn more about the group responsible for France’s worst terrorist outrage this century, they know that piecing together Boumeddiene’s transformation from a relaxed young woman into a terrorist training with a crossbow will be essential. The former supermarket cashier is said to have been radicalised by the man she would go on to marry in an Islamic, rather than civil, ceremony.

Like her husband, Boumeddiene was born into a large family of seven children, but when she was just six her mother died.

She is from an Algerian background and family members altered their surname to ‘make it sound more French’, according to an investigating source.

Estranged from her father, Boumeddiene ended up in care, relying on social workers to bring her up.

She was in her early 20s when she met Coulibaly in Juvisy, the rundown Paris suburb where he was brought up. Questioned by police at his home in Nanterre, another Paris suburb, Boumeddiene’s father yesterday said he was ‘shocked and horrified’ to learn his daughter was involved with a terrorist cell.

Taking aim: Boumeddiene and Coulibaly on another break in Cantal in 2010

But this time to meet his terror mentor Djamel Beghal in rural France, where they both learned how to use a crossbow

She told police who interviewed her in 2010 as part of their inquiries into Coulibaly’s dealings with Islamic extremists that she had walked away from a low-paid job as a cashier in 2009 and began wearing an Islamic veil, the kind that is now illegal in France.

Boumeddiene said that she was inspired by her husband and the radicals she lived with to ‘read a lot of books on religion, and because of this I came to ask questions on religion’.

She added: ‘When I saw the massacre of the innocents in Palestine, in Iraq, in Chechnya, in Afghanistan or anywhere the Americans sent their bombers, all that… well, who are the terrorists?’

She said that when Americans killed innocents, it was the right of men to defend their women and children – one of the reasons she said she started weapons training. Along with Coulibaly, she was pictured in 2010 visiting a convicted Al Qaeda terrorist, mentor Djamel Beghal – who was radicalised at the Finsbury Park mosque in North London – while he was under house arrest in Murat, Central France.

Until recently the couple lived in Bagneux, a suburb of Paris where they were known as a devoutly religious

When police questioned her and said they knew she and Coulibaly had visited Beghal at the same time as Cherif Kouachi and two other convicted terrorists – jihadi recruiter Ahmed Laidouni and Farid Melouk of the Armed Islamic State terror group – she replied: ‘We went there for crossbow practice.’

Until recently the couple lived in Bagneux, a suburb of Paris where they were known as a devoutly religious, despite Coulibaly’s regular run-ins with the law.

To neighbours, the pair were quiet and respectful. But while Boumeddiene had no criminal record, Coulibaly has a long history of both petty and serious crimes.

The only boy of a family of ten in Juvisy, he first came to police attention as a 17-year-old. Convictions for theft and drug offences followed and he was arrested for an attempted armed robbery on a bank in Orleans in September 2002.

Boumeddiene, who was never seen in public without her veil, waited four years for Coulibaly to come out of jail after his conviction for armed robbery.

She met the younger of the Kouachi brothers, Cherif, at a time when the pair were linked with a jihadist recruitment ring that sent fighters to Iraq. Cherif was convicted in 2008 and sentenced to three years in jail, with 18 months suspended, for his association with the underground organisation. He had wanted to fly to Iraq via Syria and was found with a manual for a Kalashnikov – the automatic weapon used in last week’s outrages.
