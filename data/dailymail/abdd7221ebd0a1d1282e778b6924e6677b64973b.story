Chancellor George Osborne spent more than £43,000 of taxpayers' money in a bid to prevent the European Union from introducing a cap on bankers' bonuses.

Mr Osborne paid the money to a team of outside legal advisers while he considered taking an action to the European Court of Justice. 

However, the chancellor announced last month that he was abandoning his court challenge after he admitted that his case was 'unlikely to succeed'. 

Chancellor George Osborne spent £43,000 on legal fees in a bid to overturn an EU cap on bankers' bonuses

This comes as four of Britain's high street banks have awarded their senior executives shares worth more than £30 million on top of their basic pay. 

Shadow treasury minister Cathy Jamieson used the Freedom of Information Act to uncover the total cost of outside legal advice used by the Treasury. 

Ms Jamieson criticised the chancellor's use of external legal advisers to prevent a cap on the bonus payments to senior bankers. 

She said: 'While working families face a cost-of-living crisis, it is astounding George Osborne chose to waste taxpayers' money fighting a bank bonus cap. 

'His decision revealed his true priorities and showed just how out of touch he is.'

The Government complained that the planned cap, which restricts bonuses to 100 per cent of a banker's pay - or 200 per cent with the approval of shareholders - would encourage banks to increase basic pay. 

They also feared any cap could force talented bankers to flee Europe to areas of the world where they will be better remunerated. 

A Treasury spokeman said: 'As we have already said, the Government incurred some costs for external legal advice as part of its legal challenge to the EU bonus cap. These figures have already been fully disclosed.'

Meanwhile, it has emerged four of Britian's high street banks have paid out more than £30 million in shares to their senior management despite EU efforts to restrict bonuses.

The Guardian reported that the money was paid to 'a dozen or so individuals' working for HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The last two banks have received substantial taxpayer bail-outs. 

HSBC  paid its chief executive Stuart Gulliver £1.7 million in share awards. He was one of 13 people at the bank who received £13 million between them. 

Barclays gave £8 million people to its top dozen people while RBS - which is almost 80 per cent taxpayer owned - shared £5.5 million between ten people. 

Lloyds Banking Group, which is 24 per cent owned by the taxpayer gave its chief executive approximately £1 million while ten of his most senior colleagues shared a further £4 million. 

The European Banking Authority believes that the bonus awards breach the EU caps, but the Bank of England, which is opposed to the new EU rules, allowed the payments.
