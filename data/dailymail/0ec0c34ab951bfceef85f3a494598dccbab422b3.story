It is the extraordinary encounter every holidaymaker wishes they could have - a close-up with a whale.

These tourists managed to capture amazing footage while on a boat in Mexico, showing them petting two whales in the wild.

The mother and baby are first seen approaching the boat and gently nudging it as if to say hello.

And it isn't long before the holidaymakers work up the courage to touch the animals as they bob near the surface.  

The video, which lasts for just over one minute, was filmed by Jean-Christophe Arbonne in Laguna San Ignacio, in Baja California, earlier this year.

The whales seem to enjoy the attention, rolling over and letting the tourists pet them.

The adult even opens and closes its mouth, spraying the holidaymakers with water.

A waterproof camera captures the majestic animals both above and below the surface of the water and shows them circling and repeatedly nudging the boat.

One of the tourists can be heard saying 'wow,' before another onlooker says, 'yeah love this'. The three tourists laugh excitedly as they stroke the whales during a truly unforgettable boat ride.

As if to say farewell, one of the whales can then be seen raising its head up from the water and opening its mouth.  

Whale watching boat trips can be hit and miss at the best of times, with operators unable to guarantee that holidaymakers will be able to catch sight of the spectacular mammals.

But this Mexican sighting appears to be a one-of-a-kind experience.
