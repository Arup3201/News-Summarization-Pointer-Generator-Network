The town of Cinderford, Gloucestershire, usually heralds the start of the festive season with an impressive display of lights.

Flashing signs, shooting stars and illuminated snowmen are strung from lampposts in the town centre - bringing residents the first twinkles of Christmas.

But this year the town has been forced to abandon its traditional display after being told it needed to spend £2,000 to make sure it passed the council's health and safety checks.

Hard to see: This year the displays in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, have been replaced with fairy lights wrapped around lampposts

Traditional: The streets, seen here in 2005, are usually decorated with bright festive lights

Local councillors were told by Gloucester County Council they would have to stress-test each lamppost to prove they could safely bear the weight of the lights. 

But officials said that they could not afford to pay for the tests, which cost £60 per post. 

Instead they removed strips of LED lights from inside their stock of decorations and wrapped them around lampposts in the town - leaving residents with a display lacking in festive cheer.

Mark Turner, who has lived in the town for almost 30 years, said: 'I was so shocked when I saw them. When it's dark they light up a little bit but otherwise they are not noticeable.

'They are extremely underwhelming. It's disappointing that the council didn't consult us first.'

Mr Turner, who is standing as a prospective town councillor in the first by-election in 20 years, added: 'I was shocked when I saw the lights being put up on Sunday.

'I thought they were going to be in addition to the usual lights that we have, but then I was told that was it for Cinderford and no more would be going up.

'People have been walking past and just shaking their heads, it's just unbelievable. They are not very festive at all.'  

Former mayor Max Coburn, now a district councillor for Cinderford East, was surprised that Gloucestershire County Council had insisted on the stress testing.

He said: 'They said these poles tend to rust easily so need to be tested, but I haven't seen any fall down yet.

'It will be a shame but we just can't afford it. With 30 poles it would have been very expensive to stress test each one.

'We will have to concentrate on the lights in and around the clock tower and triangle this year instead.'

Town council clerk Lynda Thomas added that they plan to make up for the poor lighting with a better display in the town centre.

She said: 'The council considered all options, but as the budget is set, there was no extra funding available. 

Christmas cheer: Residents are disappointed that the council have not put up the traditional display of lights

'It was agreed to try this scheme for this year to see how effective it is, and to consider any changes when discussing the budget again in January.'

Ken Pitt, street lighting manager at the Gloucestershire County Council, defended the decision to insist on stress testing.

He said: 'Cinderford Town Council is more than welcome to install Christmas displays on street lights. 

'However, last year we found that one of the street lights that a display was installed on was corroded.

'With the added weight of the decoration, this was extremely dangerous and could have caused a serious accident.

'Following last year's discovery, it's vital that we make sure all our street lights are safe to support any additional weight and we've been speaking to the town council for several months to arrange to test the lights they want to use.' 

Health and Safety Executive Chairwoman Judith Hackitt added: 'Here we go again, the season of Christmas health and safety myths is upon us. 

'It is nonsense to suggest that lampposts need to be "stress tested" before fairy lights can be put up. 

'One can only guess at the real reason behind this silly decision but it's not about health and safety.'
