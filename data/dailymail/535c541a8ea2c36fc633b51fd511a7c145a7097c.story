Berkeley, California, one of the most liberal cities in the nation, have overwhelmingly approved the nation's first 'sugar tax,' which will raise the cost of sodas and energy drinks by one penny per ounce.

A similar tax in neighboring San Francisco, which would have levied two cents per ounce, failed to pass - gaining 55percent of the vote, short of the two-thirds majority needed. 

The Berkeley tax would raise the cost of a can of Pepsi from $1 to $1.12, but bigger fountain drinks would get hit harder. A large Coke from McDonald's would go from $2.29 to $2.61. A two liter of soda would go from $3.99 to closer to $4.75. 

Victory: Berkeley voters passed a tax on soda Tuesday night, with 75percent voting yes. The liberal city is the first in the nation to levy a 'sugar tax'

The new penny per ounce tax will raise the cost of soda in Berkeley, California, when it takes effect next year.

At 7-11, a 40-oz Super Big Gulp would go from $1.89 to $2.29. 

The tax does not apply to diet sodas and will take effect on January 1, 2015.  

Lobbyists from soda companies, restaurants and convenience stores have fought the two proposed taxes with massive campaign cash. The American Beverage Association spent more than $10million to defeat the initiatives in both San Francisco and Berkeley, according to Bloomberg. 

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose proposed ban on any soda over 16 ounces in the nation's largest city was struck down in the courts, gave $650,000 to support to 'yes' campaign. 

Industry lobbyists cautioned against drawing national conclusions from the victory in Berkeley - long a liberal enclave. 

'Berkeley doesn’t look like mainstream America. If politicians want to stake their political reputation on this, they do so at their own risk,' Chris Gindlesperger, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, which represents soda makers like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, told Politico. 

Berkeley, population 112,000, is home to the University of California-Berkeley and has been the center of progressive causes since the 1950s. 

Advocates, however, crowed about the  75percent margin of victory, which came despite the beverage industry spending an estimated $30 per vote in the city on mailers, flyers and campaign ads.

'We think it's going to be a historic moment for our kids' health. It shows that a community can organize for its own interests in spite of the outrageous amount of money spent against its interests,' Martin Bourque, a spokesman for the 'yes' campaign told the San Jose Mercury News.

'The tides have turned on Big Soda.'

City officials hope the tax will add $1million to $2million every year to Berkeley's general fund. 

The penny-per-ounce tax will raise the cost of supersize sodas like the Super Big Gulp and Double Big Gulp from 7-11 by 40 to 50 cents
