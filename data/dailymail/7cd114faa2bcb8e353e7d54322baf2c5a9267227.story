A morbidly obese woman, who lost 165lbs in order to qualify for gastric bypass surgery, nearly derailed the impact of the life-saving procedure when she allowed emergency room doctors to insert a feeding tube into her stomach for malnourishment - without consulting her weight-loss surgeon.

When Angel, from Kerrville, Texas, joined TLC's obesity series My 600lbs Life, she weighed 570lbs and was consuming between 10 and 12lbs of food a day. But after realizing that her weight was forcing her to miss out on her son Andrew's life, she made the decision to travel to Houston to have weight loss specialist Dr Younan Nowzaradan perform surgery as a final attempt to save her family and her life.

Following her surgery however, the 42-year-old mom began experiencing nausea and allowed her boyfriend Donnie take her to the hospital - instead of contacting her surgeon like she was instructed – where doctors inserted a feeding tube into her stomach, believing that she was ‘malnourished’.

Emotional moment: Angel, from Kerrville, Texas was filled with tears as she described how her weight has spiraled out of control on the latest episode of My 600lb Life

Feeling helpless: The 42-year-old mom weighed 570lbs when she started the show and was unable to care for herself 

'I didn't have time to call Dr Nowzaradan while I was there, so I told him afterwards,' she explained. 'He was pretty upset.'

She added: 'I feel like I keep getting close to getting my life back and then something happens. I just want to keep making progress and get back to living again.'

Dr Nowzaradan demanded that Angel travel to see him in Houston immediately, so he could assess the amount of damage that was done by the doctors in Kerrville.

'I am hoping I didn't make the wrong decision and will regret it for the rest of my life,' Angel said.

In his office, Dr Nowzaradan had her read the written instructions he had given her after her gastric bypass, which included a line about calling her surgeon if she started vomiting. 

While Angel said she couldn't call because she didn't have a phone on her, Donnie explained that he genuinely believed she was just sick and would be sent back home. 

Bad decision: Angel's weight loss surgeon, Dr Younan Nowzaradan, scolded Angel and her boyfriend Donnie for letting other doctors give her a feeding tube after her gastric bypass, essentially derailing her progress 

Medical mistake: Angel experienced extreme nausea after her surgery, but instead of calling her doctor, she went to the emergency room where she was misdiagnosed as malnourished and given a feeding tube

'You don't have to have a phone,' Dr Nowzaradan told her. 'Every hospital has a phone.' 

He couldn't believe that she would have another surgery without contacting him.

'What in the world is this?' Dr Nowzaradan said as he inspected the tubes that were placed in Angel's stomach. 'Why in the world does she need a feeding tube?'

He added: 'She should not have allowed other doctors to do this.'

Dr Nowzaradan explained that the feeding tube had essentially undone the effect of her bypass and it needed to be closed off, so she could continue to lose weight. 

While the procedure to rectify the damage she had done went well, it was another road block in Angel's ongoing battle to lose weight. 

Caregiver: Before her weight loss surgery, Angel relied on her boyfriend Donnie to do everything for her, include bathe her

Out of control: Angel said that even though she felt like an 'oversized whale', she couldn't stop eating. Donnie guessed that she consumed 10 to 12lbs of food a day

Full of love: Angel hugged her son Andrew, who she was unable to play with outside because of her size 

Before meeting Dr Nowzaradan, Angel's weight was spiraling out of control. She was unable to play with Andrew, and she relied on Donnie to take care of her.

'I'm ashamed of it. It's just embarrassing,' she said. 'I see myself as an oversized whale. I just hate my body.'

She noted that she 'used to feel beautiful' before she lost control of her life.

Although she had grown up thin, she started to rapidly gain weight after her mother forced her to give up her first child, a baby girl, after she got pregnant when she was just 14 years old.

'My only choice was to give her up for adoption,' she told the camera. 'I just felt lost after that. That was one of the most painful experiences of my life, and I think about it all the time.' 

She continued: 'I turned to food for comfort, and that's when I started gaining the weight.' 

Disbelief: Angel sobbed during her first visit to Dr Nowzaradan's office in Houston. She couldn't believe that she let her weight spiral to 570lbs 

Natural size: Angel grew up thin and didn't have a problem with her weight until she got pregnant with her first child at 14 years old 

Seeking solace: After her mom forced her to give her baby girl up for adoption, she went from being thin (left) to rapidly gaining weight (right) because she turned to food during her time of grief 

When she met Donnie, she weighed 405lbs, but her size didn't bother him. He was attracted to her personality and smile. After eight years together, they found out she was pregnant with Andrew. 

According to Donnie, Angel went into a postpartum depression when Andrew was born that she never came out of.

'She just stopped living,' he said. 

He went on to say that she has no idea how much she eats a day, explaining that she consumes 10 to 12lbs of food a day. Donnie had reached his limits and was debating leaving her for the sake of their son. 

'Andrew is very aware of his mom's weight,' he said. 'It is really affecting him too. He doesn't get to go outside a lot because I literally cannot leave the house for very long because she is not able to care for herself.'

He added: 'This isn't what I signed up for. I feel like a single dad all the time. She is here but not really. I feel like she just quit on me.' 

Mental health: As a part of her weight loss plan, Angel began seeing a therapist, so she could stop blaming herself for giving up her baby 

No choice: Angel started to cry while she told her therapist how she was forced to put her baby up for adoption 

Angel reached out to Dr Nowzaradan in order to save her family and regain life because she had hit her 'breaking point'. She feared that her son would grow up without a mom because she couldn't take charge. 

However, when she traveled to Houston in hopes of receiving weight loss surgery, she was ordered to lose 50lbs before they could proceed. 

'I'm not going to think about it. I am doing it,' Angel told Donnie of shedding pounds. 

Months later, Angel lost 165lbs and was ready for surgery, but there were even more complications. 

Dr Nowzaradan had to stop in the midst of surgery because he discovered excessive-scar tissue from previous surgeries, which he attempted to remove. 

'This surgery is the last chance to save my family, and I feel like I am losing it,' Angel later explained. 

Dr Nowzaradan was eventually able to give her the gastric bypass she so desperately needed, and Angel continued to make progress. After surgery she even went to one of Andrew's football games, something she was never able to do before. 

Making memories: Angel was finally able to go with Donnie to watch Andrew's football game after her weight loss surgery 

All alone: Donnie can be seen helping Andrew with his football pads. Before Angel started losing weight, he said he felt like a single parent

Life-changing: Angel's weight loss allowed her to get out of bed and spend quality time with Donnie and Andrew for the first time in years 

But the feeding tube she was later given threatened to ruin everything.

'We are dodging a bullet today,' Dr Nowzaradan said when he fixed Angel's botched surgery.

After all of her struggles, Angel was still determined to lose weight and take control of her life. 

In addition to following her diet and becoming more active, she started seeing a therapist to learn why she is 'sad all of the time'. 

During one of her sessions Angel discussed how traumatic it was for her to give her first child up for adoption. Her therapist helped her realize that she had no choice and she can't keep blaming herself what happened in the past. 

Angel continued to get better both mentally and physically. She started helping around the house and going to all of Andrew's games.

Making progress: A year after she started chronicling her journey for My 600lbs Life, Angel was excited to learn that she weighed 261lbs 

Before and After: Angel lost half her body weight and returned to a size she hadn't seen since high school 

For the first time in years, Angel was happy to go shopping for new clothes because she knew they would now fit her body 

'I don't want to miss a single thing from here on out,' she said. 

Donnie noted: 'Andrew has two full-time parents now, and he loves every minute.'

She added: 'When I wake up, and it's not to eat. It's to get Andrew ready for school. I am back to normal.'

A year after she started chronicling her journey on My 600lbs Life, Angel had lost 309lbs - more than half of her body weight.

At 261lbs, as weight she hasn't seen since high school, she is now contributing around the house, spending quality time with her son and for the first time in years, she has even gone shopping for new clothes.  

'This past year has been a roller coast ride, but it is all worth it because I am not just doing it for myself,' she said of her progress. 'I am doing it for my family.'
