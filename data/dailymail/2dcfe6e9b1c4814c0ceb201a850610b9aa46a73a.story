A University of Utah football star envied by Elliot Rodger for his popularity with girls has said he was deeply unsettled to find out he was included in the virgin killer's hate-filled manifesto.

Running back Lucky Radley barely knew 22-year-old Rodger when they lived in the same neighborhood as children, but the mass murderer became obsessed with the gregarious and outgoing athlete's ability to attract the opposite sex, calling him 'an object of my extreme jealousy and hatred.'

In his vicious 140-page manifesto that explains why he shot and stabbed six University of California, Santa Barbara, students on Friday, Rodger mentions another boy who is popular with girls before positively seething with jealousy at Radley.

Stunned: University of Utah footballer Lucky Radley has said he is shocked to have been named in Eliot Rodger's manifesto justifying the stabbing and shootings of six people on Friday

'Another one was Lucky Radley, the black kid I played with in father’s neighborhood,' Rodgers wrote according to the Deseret News.

'He transferred to Pinecrest during that very year, and he immediately became popular with the pretty girls of his grade. I hated him for it.'

When Radley was told that he had featured in the horrific manifesto,  My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger, he struggled to even remember the killer when they attended school in Woodland Hills, California more than 10-years-ago.

'Honestly, I was just disturbed by the whole thing,' said Radley, who is back home in California with family before the Utes begin summer workouts.

'I’m kind of at a loss for words. I never thought anyone would think of me like that.

'I like, flipped out, I went crazy,' Lucky Radley said. 'Speechless.'

Sick: Elliot Rodger, 22, stabbed three people in his home and shot dead three other students before he took his own life on Friday. The rampage came after he posted rants online about how women hated him

At best they played video games together and Radley appeared on CNN on Monday morning to say that he was never even close to Rodger.

'It’s crazy,' said Radley.

'I went over to his house a couple of times, played games with him,' Radley said during the television interview.

'He was … he sat at the same desk or the same table as me in my classroom. I didn’t know him. I mean, that’s about as far as it goes.'

Radley described the Rodger he knew as a smart loner who never looked him in the eye.

'He would have one-word answers. I never really heard him speak,' he said.

The footballer first realized that Rodger had unleashed a rampage across Isla Vista, California on Saturday, when his girlfriend handed him a phone with mass killer's confessional video.

'I was just like, ‘Wow, this guy lived literally three doors down from me,' Radley told The Salt Lake Tribune'.

'He was really quiet. He never said anything.

'Literally, I’ve done nothing wrong to him whatsoever.

'I really hung out with him in fourth grade. After that, he was kind of doing his thing. I was into sports and he was kind of into other things.'

Victims: Rodger's first victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right

Radley said that he was shocked that Rodger held a grudge against him for so long.

The popular footballer said that he remembers Rodger wearing a Blink 182 hoodie and that they sat at the same table in fourth-grade.

He told the Salt Lake Tribune that Rodger's step-mother was worried that he son did not socialize and asked Radley to spend time with hi,.

'I would always play outside and try to catch lizards and stuff like that, and his mom would try to engage us and say, ‘Oh, come over! We have lizards in our backyard!’ or ‘Come over, we have pizza!; said Radley.

They lost touch during middle school, and Radley hadn’t seen him since.

Heartbroken: His father, Richard Martinez, breaks down next to his brother as he speaks to the media outside the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Headquarters on Saturday

Sadness: Two students comfort each other as they attend a candlelight vigil for the victims on Saturday night

During his interview on CNN, Radley was read a section of Rodger's manifesto:

'Lucky would later go to the same middle school as me, where he would become an object of extreme jealousy and hatred. Looking back, I can't believe I actually played with him as a friend in my father's neighborhood.'

Responding to this, Radley said he was 'just shocked. I literally didn't believe it...I couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it.'

Of course, despite his unfortunate involvement in the manifesto, Radley said that the victims and their families have his condolences.

'My heart goes out to the families of the victims,' he said.

'You see things like this in movies, but you never imagine anything like this. For me to be connected to it, I’m still mind blown from it.'
