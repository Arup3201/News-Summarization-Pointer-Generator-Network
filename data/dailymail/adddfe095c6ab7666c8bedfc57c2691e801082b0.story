For over a century it has immortalised the great and the good in paint and canvas.

But the National Portrait Gallery looks set to ruffle Establishment feathers with its latest commission.

The gallery has awarded coveted hanging space to an artist whose back catalogue includes this raunchy painting of a pregnant Kate Middleton.

Nick Lord, 25, was crowned Portrait Artist of the Year and his work will be hung at the National Portrait Gallery

Nick Lord, 25, was crowned winner of the Sky Arts Portrait Artist of the Year competition last night.

Hosted by presenter Joan Bakewell and comedian Frank Skinner, the show whittled down more than 1,800 entrants from around the country to find the nation’s most promising new portrait painter.

Mr Lord won with an oil painting of Iraq war veteran Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry, who won the Victoria Cross in 2005 after saving fellow soldiers from two ambushes.

The competition’s judges – including National Portrait Gallery director Sandy Nairne - described the work as ‘magnificent, bold and accomplished’ and it will hang in the gallery for a week.

But it is his earlier works that are likely to raise eyebrows.

Earlier this year, the former graffiti artist from Cardiff – who used to make a living painting model trains for his father’s business – completed a rather less flattering portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge.

He won for this portrait of Victoria Cross winner LCpl Johnson Beharry which the judges called 'magnificent'

Imagined topless apart from a leopard print bra, the heavily pregnant royal was depicted on in a suggestive pose that is unlikely to win the artists many friends in Buckingham Palace.

And the royal family are not the only ones who have cause for alarm. As part of his prize, Mr Lord has been awarded a £10,000 commission to paint double-Booker prize winning author Hilary Mantel.

The portrait will be hung prominently in the British Library when it is unveiled next spring and will become part of its permanent collection.

Mr Lord could not be contacted to discuss his unusual artwork yesterday.

But speaking ahead of the final Sky Arts episode he did shed some light on his unconventional artistic background.

He said: ‘I like to listen to hip hop on my headphones while I’m working. The music helps me to focus and it goes hand in hand with the whole underground culture of graffiti art.

‘I started out learning to do graffiti writing when I was a teenager. For me, it is a form of fine art.

‘I’m sure some of the great artists of the past would have painted with a spray can if they had the chance, although it’s impossible to say which ones. Perhaps [Austrian painter] Egon Schiele.

He added: ‘I generally paint my subjects from photos rather than from life. I like to capture them in moments that reveal their personalities rather than in formal poses.

‘It is a dream come true to have one of my paintings in the National Portrait Gallery. It is the perfect start to my career.’

Mr Lord – who has a degree in fine art - has now started work on his portrait of Mrs Mantel, best known for her historical novel Wolf Hall.

He said: ‘I’ve met her twice and taken lots of photos. She is an amazing character and said it is up to me how I paint her. Of course I am nervous because I want her to like it, and it will be seen by everyone who goes into the British Library.’
