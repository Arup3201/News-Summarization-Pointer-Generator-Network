Pollen from a garden has helped to identify the killer of a nine-year-old boy 28 years after the shocking crime.

Police announced today they had solved the mystery of Christopher Laverack’s murder and named his uncle Melvyn Read as the killer.

Read, a convicted predatory paedophile, died from natural causes in prison four years ago at the age of 65 while still a suspect for the schoolboy’s murder.

However, thanks to new scientific advances, vital forensic evidence was obtained linking Read’s garden to the victim.

Unusual pollen spores and other plant material specific to Read’s garden were found on Christopher’s clothing.

And a brick found with the schoolboy’s body was forensically shown to have been part of a water feature in Read’s garden. Read lived a 10-minute walk away from the house where Christopher was staying the night he vanished in March 1984.

The schoolboy was left alone with an 18-month-old baby for about 70 minutes when the toddler’s father went to the pub. He returned to find Christopher missing and called police.

His body was found two days later in a beck. He had been savagely beaten to death with a blunt instrument and there was evidence of a sexual assault.

Christopher had been placed inside a large plastic bag weighed down by an ornamental brick - later found to be from Read’s garden.

The killer eluded detectives, but a breakthrough came in March 2002 when the boy’s uncle Melvyn Read was arrested for sexually assaulting four young boys who were known to him.

Although some of these crimes dated back to the late 1980s they all took place after the murder.

Read was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in April 2003 and a police review of the unsolved murder showed a strong circumstantial case against him.

He lived locally, owned a car which fitted the description of a vehicle seen near the victim’s house on the night, he did not have an alibi, had previous knowledge of the beck where the body was dumped and was shown to have lied to police about key issues in the case.

Read had the ‘means and motive’ but the case ‘lacked the final piece of a very complex jigsaw’ because there was no scientific evidence against him.

All hope of a confession ended when Read died in 2008, three weeks before he was due to be released from prison.

When historical DNA analysis drew a blank Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins of Humberside Police asked Dr Patricia Wiltshire, a leading expert in the study of pollen and plant spores, to look at the case.

She concluded there was enough ‘unusual pollen and other plant material’ on the clothing Christopher was wearing when he was killed to link him to Read’s garden.

Humberside Police said when Dr Wiltshire finished her work last year there was ‘scientific evidence to show that Christopher had been in close contact with Read’s garden the night he went missing.’

An independent review of the evidence by a leading criminal QC concluded had Read been alive the evidence would have led to a charge of murder and a realistic chance of conviction.

Paul Watson, QC, described the weight of evidence as ‘conclusive.’ Christopher’s mother was said to be relieved that ‘some unanswered questions have now been answered’ but police said she still finds the subject of her son’s murder ‘too painful to talk about.’

Det Supt Ray Higgins said: ‘Read was an evil man and a man wholly without remorse. I am satisfied that Christopher’s family can have some sense of closure and understanding of what happened.

‘This case has taken many years to resolve. We would all wish the evidence to convict were available sooner and whilst Read was still alive to face trial, however that was not to be.

‘The few officers still working on this case, between their other duties, have been determined to do all possible to solve the case and have simply refused to give up.’
