World's smallest: Miniaturist David Edwards has created a violin just an inch-and-a-half long, one 12th their normal size

A musician has created the world’s smallest violin, standing just an inch-and-a-half long, and is selling them for more than £1,000. 

David Edwards, who once played cello in the Scottish National Orchestra, gave up his professional music career to make doll’s house miniatures when he realised there was a gap in the market.

The miniaturist from Edinburgh has made his hobby a full-time career, creating hand-crafted pieces including mini everyday household items such as pegs small enough to fit through the eye of a needle, mini shaving brush and razor and kitchenware.

The violins, based on the world-renowned Stradivarius, stand just one 12th of the normal size and can fetch a small fortune.

Mr
Edwards, 76, said: ‘I’m the best in the world by far and I’m very well 
known internationally.

'My pieces have the most detail for their size.

‘I’ve tried making them smaller but then they would look very bland. I like them to still be recognisable.’

‘I make ordinary things but of a very high quality.

‘I know what a violin looks like, that’s why I have a big advantage over other people where making violins is concerned.

‘There’s no doubt my miniature violins are the best in the world.’

He began carving out his career in miniatures after making furniture for his daughter’s doll’s house.

He was a professional musician playing 
with the Covent Garden Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the 
Edinburgh Quartet and the Scottish National Orchestra before he decided 
to pursue his passion to become a miniaturist.

He said: ‘I enjoy my work, it’s my life. It’s my passion and I’ve been very lucky.

‘I’m quite happy working on my own because I can do exactly what I want.

‘It’s different to being in an 
orchestra where they run a very tight discipline even though as a 
musician you spend a lot of time working on your own.’

Mr Edwards has more than 100 different pieces in his collections and always keeps one piece from every batch he makes.

Carving out his career: Mr Edwards has made more than 100 different pieces and uses materials such as pear wood, plumwood and ebony

Previously, he made miniatures to order but decided against it when his orders came stretched to seven years in advance. He decided it was easier to make the pieces in batches because there was worldwide demand for them.

The craftsman uses materials such as pear wood, plumwood and ebony to create the pieces which take from two weeks to three months to make. 

In 2009 miniaturist Peter Riches sold a 23-room dolls house for £50,000, while some houses on the UK property market were for sale for less than that.

The mini mansion had its own servants’ quarters, a music room with grand piano, a hand-crafted games room with snooker table and a library with over 1,000 separately bound books, and took Mr Riches a painstaking 15 years to complete.
