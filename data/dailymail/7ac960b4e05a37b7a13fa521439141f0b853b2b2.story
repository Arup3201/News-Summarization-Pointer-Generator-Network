‘While we are unsure of all the events that transpired that day, but we are comforted knowing they are together,’ the statement said.

A couple of hours after the afternoon killing spree Tuesday, police learned that three people at a Motel 6 near I-29 and Barry Road  had been physically assaulted, and another was nearly carjacked.

The police statement said no weapon was used in those assaults. In the course of the investigation, police found a 2002 Toyota Highlander that had been stolen from one of the crime scenes.

Shortly before midnight, officers arrested Brandon Howell, whom they positively identified as a suspect in the motel assaults, according to a police statement.

Responding police officers also seized a gun from the suspect at the time of his arrest, Fox 4 KC reported. 

According to the shooting victims' neighbors, the deadly spree resulted from a botched robbery.

Local residents speaking to Fox 4 KC said that Susan Choucroun and the Hursts spotted a man trying to steal a vintage Jaguar from their neighbors' house on Woodbridge Lane.

Heartbroken: Charles Choucroun tearfully recalled the moment he was told his wife, Susan, was among the casualties 

Not knowing that the would-be car thief was armed with a shotgun, the victims came up to him as he was trying to drive away and were shot at a point-blank range.

The gunman then jumped into a Toyota Highlander belonging to the couple he had beaten up and took off from the scene.

Neighbor Vicki Gruver, 74, described Lorene Hurst as a lovely lady who enjoyed travel, and Darrel Hurst as a doting son.

Susan Choucroun is survived by her husband, Charles, who owns a beauty salon in Prairie Village. The elderly man was not home at the time of the tragedy.

Speaking to Fox4 KC, the devastated man tearfully recounted how he came home Tuesday only to discover crime scene tape around his block. 

One of the police officers on the scene broke the news to him that his wife was among the victims.

More details also emerged today about the violent past of the man at the center of the triple murder investigation.

Brandon Howell was accused in the late 1990s of killing two teenagers in Johnson County, but in 2009 a jury found him not guilty.

The 34-year-old also has a prior conviction in connection to a 1999 burglary where a cat named Tony was beheaded. He was released on parole in 2011.

A car to die for: Neighbors say the Hursts and Choucroun were killed because they prevented the gunman from staling this vintage Jaguar from a nearby home 

Clue: Police found this 2002 Toyota Highlander that was stolen from one of the crime scenes  

Tom Brewer, the father of 16-year-Tabitha Brewer who was killed along with her boyfriend, Nick Travis, 18, in 1998, told the Kansas City Star Wednesday that when he saw Howell's picture on TV, he immediately recognized him as the man who was acquitted in his daughter's murder.

‘I feel sorry for the jurors who acquitted him the last time because that is going to be hard for them to live with,’ Brewer said. ‘I believe justice is always served one way or another.’ 

The triple homicide - the most deadly incident Kansas City has seen in more than two years - left people living in the middle-class neighborhood shaken.

‘In the last few years we’ve had many young families move in. It is a very, very desirable place to live,’ Jo Lombardino, a member of the Woodbridge Homes Association, told the Kansas City Star. 

Possible connection: Investigators were called to this Motel 6 just four blocks from where the missing SUV was found after getting reports of three assaults and a carjacking
