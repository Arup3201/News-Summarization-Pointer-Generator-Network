Personal statements on university application forms should be scrapped because they are unfair to state school pupils, a study claimed today.

The Sutton Trust education charity found state pupils are more likely to make writing errors and to struggle to draw on suitable work experience.

Private school pupils are likelier to use ‘appropriate’ language in the 600-word texts and to describe prestigious job placements or other activities.

Unfair: State school pupils were more likely to make errors in their personal statements, the study found

Half a million of the essays are penned every year by applicants seeking to sell themselves to their preferred universities.

One private school pupil cited six high-status work placements including a stint on the trading floor of a top firm of stockbrokers and ‘most recently managing a small gastro pub’.

In contrast, a state school pupil had written that ‘in the final GCSE year there was an opportunity for a group of us to manage the school lockers’.

The study also warned of growing evidence that personal statements are ‘for sale’ and teenagers are paying up to £350 for statements written for them by graduates.

The research, commissioned by the Sutton Trust education charity, called for the personal statement section of the UCAS application form to be radically overhauled to prevent pupils ‘exploiting school type advantages’.

It said there was anecdotal evidence some pupils received so much help the statement could not be seen as their ‘own work’.

Applicants should be only be able to list a limited number of experiences - perhaps as few as one, the report said.

Rather than allowing a ‘free response’, UCAS should consider inviting applicants to answer a specific question.

Instead of simply listing their previous achievements, applicants should be asked to state which attributes they would bring to a course or university.

Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: ‘Personal statements should be more than an excuse to highlight past advantages.

‘Applicants should outline how they might contribute to campus life, and universities should make it clear that applicants are not penalised for lacking opportunities in the past due to family circumstances.’

The study, by Dr Steven Jones, of Manchester University, analysed 309 personal statements written by teenagers with three Bs at A-levels who were applying to the same department of an elite university.

He found that state school applicants appeared to receive less help in composing their statements and made three times more grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors.

When discussing work experience, they were more likely to mention Saturday jobs such as waitressing at KFC or stacking shelves at Aldi rather than prestigious placements.

One private school applicant had talked of shadowing the Indian Ambassador to the United Nations. Privately-educated pupils were also more likely to cite working in family businesses.

And when it came to listing hobbies and interests, the activities described by state school students tended to ‘carry little weight in the admissions process’, the study said.

It highlighted examples of private school applicants citing cordon bleu cookery courses at Anton Mosimann’s school and skiing seasons at Meribel.

But one state school applicant had written about following Manchester United, adding: ‘I regularly watch Match of the Day and I enjoy the diversity of the Champions League.’

Seventy per cent of the privately-educated applicants in the study ended up being accepted by an elite university, against just 50 per cent from comprehensives and colleges.

The report called for state schools to give pupils better advice and guidance in drawing up their statements.

It added: ‘UCAS should consider whether the personal statement, in its current form, is an appropriate and fair indicator of applicants’ potential.’

And it said: ‘A fairer structure for the personal statement might be one that allows one activity only to be listed.’

UCAS chief executive Mary Curnock Cook, said: ‘I have every confidence in the professionalism of admissions officers - they are highly experienced in recognising social factors in the content of personal statements.

‘The personal statement is one of a number of pieces of evidence that admissions staff look at when assessing an applicant’s potential to succeed in higher education.’
