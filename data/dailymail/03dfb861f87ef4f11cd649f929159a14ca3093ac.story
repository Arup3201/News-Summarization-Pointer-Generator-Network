The Sicilian mafia are known for their strict traditions and blood rituals that have kept their identities and practices secret for generations.

But today’s mafia are spurning their hand written coded messages and turning to social media to carry out their dirty business.

The new generation of mob bosses originally began using internet sites such as Facebook using aliases and fake identities to carry out drug deals and demand ‘pizzo’ protection money, police say.

But they are now increasingly using it to flaunt their power and wealth, according to an investigation by Espresso news magazine.

In images reminiscent of the ridiculed Rich Kids of Instagram, Sicilian boss Domenico Palazotto posted photos of himself lounging aboard gin palaces, cruising in a limousine and drinking champagne.

The 28-year-old mobster, who listed boss of bosses Massimo Messina Denaro among his likes, boasted in an online video about his way of being ‘the original godfather’.

He also joked with a wannabe Mafioso who asked him about opportunities to join the gang.

'Do I need to send a CV?' asked the applicant.

'Yes, brother,' replied Mr Palazzotto jokingly. 'We need to consider your criminal record. We do not take on people with clean records,' adding 'Join my team.. We are the strongest, ha ha ha.'

Another crime don in the clan, Salvatore D'Alessandro posted pictures of his luxury lifestyle including meals out and speed boat cruises, writing: 'For the time being I am one of the small sharks hunting in the deep,' he wrote.

'But the moment will come when I rise to the surface and will have no pity for anyone.'

But rather than cementing their power, investigators say the online bragging could be the downfall of the new generation.

Mr Palazzotto was among 95 arrested in June in 'Operation Apocalypse' which police said took down the rising stars of the city’s new Cosa Nostra gangs.
