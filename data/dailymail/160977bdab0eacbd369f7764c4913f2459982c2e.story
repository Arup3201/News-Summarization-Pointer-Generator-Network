World, meet Nela and Nobby.

The twin polar bear cubs, born on December 9 at Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany, were officially named today but they didn't let something as trivial as a christening get in the way of all-important playtime.

Dashing about their enclosure, play fighting and generally giving their mother - Giovanna - the run around, Nela and Nobby didn't seem to have a care in the world.

Nobby and Nela have been officially given their names today

The importance of the occasion seemed lost on the pair who happily scurried around their enclosure

The twins, who are now four months old, live at Helabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany, with their mother Giovanna

Ever since the pair made their first public appearance nearly four weeks ago, there has been a lot of speculation around what they will be called.

It has taken so long to decide on names because choosing them is an honour reserved for the animals' godparents, which have just been picked.

To fill these roles, the zoo has chosen wildlife photographer Norbert Rosing, whose work often features polar bears, and a Munich-based coffee company.Â 

It has taken so long to decide on names for the bears because the zoo first had to choose their 'godparents'

Nobby's godparent is wildlife photographer Norbet Rosing, while Nela's is a local coffee company

Norbet Rosing named Nobby after himself and, when the bear is older, he will be referred to as Norbert

Nela has been named after the aunt of coffee company owner Emanuel Clemm, who was called Cornelia

The only criteria for the names was that they had to start with N - the same as for all animals born at the zoo in 2013 - but, otherwise, the godparents had free reign to decide.

Mr Rosing took the opportunity to name the cub after himself and, once Nobby has grown up, he will be referred to as Norbert.

While Emanuel Clemm, the owner of the coffee company that has sponsored Nela, chose the name in honour of his aunt Cornelia.
