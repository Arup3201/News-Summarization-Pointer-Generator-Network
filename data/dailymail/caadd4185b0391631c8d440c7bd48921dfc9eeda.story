Spanning nine floors, a luxury flat in the clock tower of a Grade II* listed former church has gone on sale for £1million.

The recently converted four-bedroom home is in what used to be St George's Church in the centre of Manchester.

As well as a bespoke spiral stair case and private lift, the remarkable conversion also boasts a Jacuzzi-style tub, gym and sauna - but it also retains the church's original arches and decorative windows. 

And even without including its manicured gardens, the apartment covers 2500 sq ft.

Danielle Kelly the estate agent handling the sale at Bridgfords said: 'It's an incredible place in a very sought after area.

'The conversion is so unusual we've had people open-mouthed when they come to look round - I've never seen anything like it.

'A buyer could move straight in as it's been finished to the highest quality.

'I'm sure someone will snap it up soon.'

The building was an early Gothic Revival church designed by architect Francis Goodwin, who also designed the original Manchester Town Hall, and was built between 1826 and 1828.

It was a Commissioners' church, built to celebrate the victory at the Battle of Waterloo, and a sum of £15,000 was allotted for construction.

The church was restored in 1884 by J. S. Crowther and designated a Grade II* listed building in October 1974, but the church was closed a decade later.

A dining area features archways with arched stainless steel radiators, a large dining table and comes with brick and glass flooring

A master bedroom features a waterbed and velux window, telephone intercom system and beamed trusses as well as fitted wardrobes

The flat retains the church's original decorative windows, left, and the gym, right, features a triple-heighted ceiling with multi-paned windows and oak flooring
