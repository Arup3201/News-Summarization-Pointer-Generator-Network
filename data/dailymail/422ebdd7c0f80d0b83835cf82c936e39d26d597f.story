A 97-year-old man was evicted from his retirement center in Napa, California and he claims it's because he played the ukulele too much.

An anonymous donor helped Jim Farrell, 97, find a new home after being thrown out by Redwood Retirement Center with no place to go but the homeless shelter.

'Management continually suppressed my talents,' said Farrell to KPIX 5.

Farrell told reporters he had some problems with the bosses at the retirement home because they tried to get him to stop playing his ukulele.

'Management would stop me and say these words: "Go back to your room!" Like a kid,' said Farrell.Farrell's caretaker Carol Eldridge, who was once an employee at Redwood Retirement, found out that Farrell was being evicted a few weeks ago.

She says he told her, 'I'm not sure my heart can take this.'

Eldridge is angered that the retirement home evicted Farrell without giving him other options.'You just don’t put a 97-year-old on the street,' she said.

Farrell was forced to spend three nights in a homeless shelter.

'Here’s this frail man and he’s got his head held up high going in the doors of this shelter and knowing that this is not the place I ever expected him to ever be,' Eldridge said.

KPIX reports that with the help of an anonymous donor funding his move, Farrell was able to transfer over to Piner's Nursing Home in Napa.

Friends are helping to raise money so that Farrell can stay at his new retirement home indefinitely.

The Mail Online contacted Redwood Retirement who sent a statement saying they terminated their agreement with Jim Farrell because of his 'aggressive behavior' towards other residents and because of the 'condition of his unit.'

Redwood Retirement claims they asked Farrell to make changes on May 24 but when he didn't abide with their rules they terminated an agreement with him on June 10.

The statement claims that Farrell left voluntarily on July 6.

'Mr. Farrell was unable to abide by the rules of the community. We took this action so our residents at Redwood Retirement could continue to live in a safe, healthy and comfortable environment they call home,' said the statement.

Farrell is currently at his new community Piner's Nursing Home and hopefully his ukulele playing is well-received.
