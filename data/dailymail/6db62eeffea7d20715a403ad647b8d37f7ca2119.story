After more than a decade of denying doping claims, disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has admitted to Oprah that he used performance-enhancing drugs to help him win seven Tour de France titles, sources revealed Monday evening.

A person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press that Armstrong confessed to Oprah Winfrey during an interview taping with the Queen of Talk, which is slated to air on Thursday on her network.

Armstrong was stripped of all seven Tour titles last year in the wake of a voluminous U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report that portrayed him as a ruthless competitor, willing to go to any lengths to win the prestigious race.

Scene: Armstrong gave the interview at the Four Seasons hotel in Austin, Texas

A group of about 10 close friends and
advisers to Armstrong left a downtown Austin hotel about three hours 
after they arrived Monday afternoon for the taping.

Among them were 
Armstrong attorneys Tim Herman and Sean Breen, along with Bill 
Stapleton, Armstrong's longtime agent, manager and business partner.

All
declined comment entering and exiting the session.

Soon afterward, Winfrey tweeted: 
'Just wrapped with (at)lancearmstrong More than 2 1/2 hours. He came 
READY!'

She was scheduled to appear on 'CBS This Morning' on Tuesday to 
discuss the interview.

Promises, promises: I'll answer the questions directly, honestly and candidly,' Armstrong said. 'That's all I can say.'

In a text to the AP on Saturday, 
Armstrong said: 'I told her (Winfrey) to go wherever she wants and I'll 
answer the questions directly, honestly and candidly. That's all I can 
say.'

Armstrong stopped at the Livestrong 
Foundation, which he founded, on his way to the interview and said, 'I'm
sorry' to staff members, some of whom broke down in tears.

A person 
with knowledge of that session said Armstrong choked up and several 
employees cried during the session.

The person also said Armstrong 
apologized for letting the staff down and putting Livestrong at risk but
he did not make a direct confession to using banned drugs.

He said he would try to restore the 
foundation's reputation, and urged the group to continue fighting for 
the charity's mission of helping cancer patients and their families.

Rae Bazzarre, a spokeswoman for Livestrong said it was emotional 'but we were all glad to see him.'

Armstrong had not been at the headquarters since October 21, Ms Bazzarre said, about two weeks before he resigned from Livestrong’s board of directors.

USADA chief executive Travis Tygart 
labeled the doping regimen allegedly carried out by the U.S. Postal 
Service team that Armstrong once led, 'The most sophisticated, 
professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever 
seen.'

After a federal investigation of the 
cyclist was dropped without charges being brought last year, USADA 
stepped in with an investigation of its own.

The agency deposed 11 
former teammates and accused Armstrong of masterminding a complex and 
brazen drug program that included steroids, blood boosters and a range 
of other performance-enhancers.

The
interview with Winfrey will be Armstrong's first public response to the
USADA report.

Armstrong is not expected to provide a detailed account 
about his involvement, nor address in depth many of the specific 
allegations in the more than 1,000-page USADA report.

After
he was stripped of his Tour titles, Armstrong defiantly tweeted a 
picture of himself on a couch at home with all seven of the yellow 
leader's jerseys on display in frames behind him.

But
the preponderance of evidence in the USADA report and pending legal 
challenges on several fronts apparently forced him to change tactics, 
and he still faces legal challenges.

He is planning to testify against several powerful people in the sport of cycling who knew about his doping and possibly facilitated it, said several people with knowledge of the situation, according to The New York Times.

Armstrong is in discussions with the United States Department of Justice to possibly testify in a federal whistle-blower case.

Former
teammate Floyd Landis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France 
title for doping, has filed a federal whistle-blower lawsuit that 
accused Armstrong of defrauding the U.S. Postal Service.

Landis claimed the team defrauded the government because its riders used performance-enhancing drugs in violation of its sponsorship contract.

The Justice 
Department has yet to decide whether it will join the suit as a 
plaintiff.

Better days: The interview, which will take place at Armstrong's home, will be broadcast Thursday on the Oprah Winfrey Network

The London-based Sunday Times also is suing Armstrong to recover about $500,000 it paid him to settle a libel lawsuit.

On
Sunday, the newspaper took out a full-page ad in the Chicago Tribune, 
offering Winfrey suggestions for what questions to ask Armstrong.

Dallas-based
SCA Promotions, which tried to deny Armstrong a promised bonus for a 
Tour de France win, has threatened to bring yet another lawsuit seeking 
to recover more than $7.5 million an arbitration panel awarded the 
cyclist in that dispute.

The lawsuit most likely to be influenced by a confession might be the Sunday Times case.

Potential
perjury charges stemming from Armstrong's sworn testimony in the 2005 
arbitration fight would not apply because of the statute of limitations.
Armstrong was not deposed during the federal investigation that was 
closed last year.

Armstrong's Oprah appearance will be the cyclist's first public response to the USADA report

Many of 
his sponsors dropped Armstrong after the damning USADA report — at the 
cost of tens of millions of dollars — and soon after, he left the board 
of the Livestrong cancer-fighting charity he founded in 1997. Armstrong 
is still said to be worth about $100 million.

Livestrong could be one reason Armstrong has decided to come forward with an apology and limited confession.

The charity supports cancer patients and still faces an image problem because of its association with Armstrong.

He may be hoping that his willingness to 
testify against the cycling union officials and his former team’s 
officials and his confession will allow him to return to 
competition in the elite triathlon or running events he participated in 
after his cycling career.

World Anti-Doping Code rules state his lifetime ban cannot be reduced to less than eight years.

WADA
and U.S. Anti-Doping officials could agree to reduce the ban further 
depending on what information Armstrong provides and his level of 
cooperation

He had a meeting last month with  United States Anti-Doping Agency officials, and it was reported by The New York Times that people with knowledge of the discussions said the officials would be willing to reduce Armstrong’s punishment if Armstrong would testify against the people who helped him dope.
