An Afghan 'international serial rapist' is facing life in jail after being convicted of sexually assaulting three Californian women.

Ali Achekzai, 33, attacked a 21-year-old woman in her car near a nightclub in Laguna Beach, Orange County, and another on a hike near Mount Soledad in San Diego.

He later fled to Canada and Austria where he was accused of rape in a separate 2009 case before being captured and extradited to California last year.

Wanted: Ali Achekzai was being sought by authorities in Canada, Austria and the U.S. before his arrest in 2009

He has since been convicted on six charges, including forcible rape and aggravated assault.

Achekzai was formerly one of the most wanted men in the U.S. after being sought by Interpol, the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Marshals Service, Canadian police, Austrian Police, San Diego police, Tustin police and the Orange County Sheriff's Department.

He was featured for years on Orange County District Attorney's 'Most Wanted' list before his arrest last year in Austria, when detectives from Tustin submitted DNA samples from their case to Interpol.

The federal police agency then completed a successful DNA match to Achekzai, who was at that time living under an assumed name in Salzburg, Austria.

He has now been convicted of sexually assaulting a 21-year-old woman in her car in a Tustin parking lot after following her as she drove away from a nightclub in Laguna Beach in 2004.

Achekzai also raped a 21-year-old woman on a hike near Mount Soledad in San Diego County in 2004 after he isolated her from her friends.

The Afghan now faces up to 80 years in prison when he is jailed on January 27 by Superior Court Judge Daniel Didier.

Achezkai had argued when he testified that the rapes were consensual sex acts.

A jury in Orange County heard Achekzai attacked a woman in a car near a nightclub in Laguna Beach, California

But a jury in Orange County, California, took less than three hours to convict him of the sex attacks.

His three victims, who did not know each other, all testified  to 'eerily similar' conduct by Achekzai, according to Deputy District Attorney Robert Mestman.

Mr Mestman said that when Achekzai attacked the woman in San Diego in 2004, he  repeatedly hit and punched the woman and told her he would kill her if she screamed.

He then sexually assaulted her on the ground, and later punched her in the mouth – knocking out a front tooth - when she told her friend what happened.

Attack: Achekzai was also convicted of assaulting a female hiker on Mount Soledad in San Diego

Achekzai was also accused of fondling a 24-year-old woman and removing her pants during a limousine ride from Laguna Beach to Costa Mesa after a night of drinking at a nightclub in 2002 as her friend slept.

But Achekzai fled the country prior to being charged for the rapes.

Authorities said he changed his name several times and is suspected of living at various times in Afghanistan, Germany, San Francisco, Canada, Austria and England.

He was arrested Jan. 26, 2010, at the Hotel Unterbrunn in the Austrian town of Neukirchen am Grossvenediger by the Salzburg Criminal Investigative Division in cooperation with the FBI and extradited to California

The case was the first international DNA hit for California law enforcement, authorities said.
