The women of Walford had better watch out - hunky Dean Wicks is back and he's threatening to break hearts. It's been six years since the jailbird stormed out of Albert Square after a bust-up with his mum Shirley and left for Australia.

Now a trained hair stylist, Dean will be opening a trendy salon, which actor Matt Di Angelo cheekily reveals is just another way for  his character to cosy up to the local ladies.

'Dean uses his job to get close to women,' Matt says with a grin. 'He likes plenty of eye candy to check out, so he's quite enjoy- ing being back. He offers them a shoulder to cry on and then gets them into bed... which is what Dean's all about.'

No change there then. In his last spell in EastEnders, from 2006-8, he bedded Stacey Slater and made a beeline for glamourpusses Dawn Swann and Chelsea Fox.

Matt's own love life has made headlines too. In 2007 his Strictly Come Dancing partner Flavia Cacace chose Matt over her long-term lover Vincent Simone, and then a year later she split with Matt to be with Corrie actor Jimi Mistry, who she's since married.

Matt's now single and keen to meet someone special. 'But,' he adds, 'Work's pretty crazy, so I find it hard even to see my friends.'

While Dean has returned to the Square to see his grandad Stan, Matt was persuaded back by the exciting plans of new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who's bringing Albert Square up to date to reflect modern-day East London.

A new set is also being built that will be 20 per cent bigger, meaning there'll be more scope for filming in new locations.

'I'd just finished filming a historical drama called Borgia when I got a call from Dominic,' explains Matt, 27, who has appeared in hit BBC1 series Hustle and several plays since leaving EastEnders.

'His enthusiasm hit me and made me consider a return. Dom's young himself and wants to bring in that young, modern element, which I like. I think it's a good thing for the show as they start to make it reflect the vibrant East End in 2014.'

Matt's last stint on the show ended with the 'shock' of his contract not being renewed. Looking back, he says it was just the nudge he needed. 'EastEnders was an apprenticeship  - I was 18, it was my first job and I learned a lot. I don't think I did all that well my first time there.

I was a teenager and just blagging it. Working on other things has made me a better, more rounded and experienced actor,' he insists. 'I've worked alongside some great people, and that really helps you learn. I've been lucky with the way things have gone.'

It remains to be seen if Walford's women will feel the same way. 

Cats or dogs? I live with my brother and we bought a Cockapoo, Artie, which we worry about like a baby! DJ or live music? I enjoy a beer with friends while watching a live band with good songs to sing along to  – I like The 1975 and The Script.Matt Damon or Brad Pitt? Matt Damon is awesome. He’s got a stillness I could watch for hours. Cate Blanchett or Meryl Streep? Meryl Streep has got to be one of my favourite actresses. She deserves all those awards!4x4 or a sports car? If I had an unlimited budget I’d buy a sports car. I like driving fast cars.Football or cricket? Football. I’m  a massive Arsenal fan and still go  to see them whenever I can.
