The judges boasted that it is the ‘most diverse’ list of novels ever nominated for the Man Booker Prize.

But readers would be forgiven for thinking it was the most obscure, after mostly unknown authors made the nominations for the literary prize.

Among those on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction are the works of three first-time authors and an E-book that was initially given away for free in return for mentions on Twitter.

Overlooked: Major authors who are off the list include Margaret Atwood, pictured left with an earlier book The Blind Assassin, and Roddy Doyle who won the Booker Prize in 1993 with Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha

The list of 13 books in contention for the £50,000 prize represents a departure from last year when Hilary Mantel became the first British person to win the award for a second time.

This year’s longlist is notable for the number of big-name authors who have been overlooked, including JM Coetzee, Roddy Doyle and Margaret Atwood. Five of the books have yet to be published.

Writer Robert Macfarlane, who chaired the judging panel, said: ‘This is surely the most diverse longlist in Man Booker history: wonderfully various in terms of geography, form, length and subject.

‘These 13 outstanding novels range from the traditional to the experimental, from the first century AD to the present day, from 100 pages to 1,000 and from Shanghai to Hendon.’

Asked if there was a shared theme for the nominees, Mr Macfarlane said that they mostly seemed to be based on disasters.

The 1,000-page work listed is The Kills by Richard House, a political thriller that was first published digitally in four parts, each with a series of short films and audio clips that add to the story.

The first volume, called Sutler, was made available free of charge to any reader who sent a message about it on Facebook or Twitter.

Mr House, an academic at the University of Birmingham, said the novel can be ‘read and enjoyed alone’ but included suggestions in his book for when readers should access the extra material.

Mr Macfarlane said all the judges had seen ‘the additional content to some extent’ and would take it into account when drawing up a shortlist but added that it was ‘by no means an advantage’ over the other more traditionally-published books.

He said: ‘The novel has always adapted and it’s a very fast-changing form and that’s one reason why it’s survived to the present. It shifts and changes and this is more shifting and changing than most.’

Two authors have been nominated before: Jim Crace, who's up this year for Harvest, and Colm Toibin for The Testament of Mary

Only two authors on the list have been nominated for the prize before. Jim Crace is listed for Harvest, which is expected to be his final novel, 16 years after he was shortlisted for Quarantine.

Colm Tóibín, who has been shortlisted twice before, is in the running for The Testament of Mary, which came out last year.

The three first-time authors on the list are NoViolet Bulawayo, who was born in Zimbabwe a year after independence, Eve Harris, whose yet-to-be-released book is set in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Hendon, London, and Donal Ryan, whose book is told from points of view of 21 people struggling to make a living in rural Ireland.

The Booker Prize, set up in 1969, is awarded each year to the best full-length English language novel.

A shortlist of six books will be announced in September with the winner named at a ceremony at the Guildhall in London on Tuesday, October 15.

The panel of five judges includes Martha Kearney, presenter of The World At One on BBC Radio 4 and The Review Show on BBC Two.

The bookies have installed Crace as the 9/2 favourite, according to Ladbrokes, but there is a far tighter range of odds quoted than normal.

Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: ‘The longlist this year was one of the hardest of all time to create odds for. At this stage we’re just favouring Crace but we don’t want to write off any contender too hastily.

‘The odds suggest the judges will be up long into the night to form the shortlist, let alone arrive at a winner.’

A spokesman for bookseller Waterstones said it was ‘a thrilling list’. He said: ‘The sheer scope and variety contained in this list mean this should be one of the most unpredictable Man Booker prizes for years.’
