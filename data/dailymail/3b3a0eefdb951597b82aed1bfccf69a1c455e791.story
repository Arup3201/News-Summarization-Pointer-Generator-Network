Steven Caulker is poised to make his protracted move to QPR pending a medical.

The 22-year-old England international has been allowed to travel to the London club for tests after Cardiff accepted an £8million offer.

Crystal Palace had also matched the fee and offered wages of around £42,000 a week but QPR have bettered those terms and convinced the former Tottenham defender that a move to Loftus Road, where he will figure alongside Rio Ferdinand, can propel him back into the international fold.

New arrival: Steven Caulker has signed for QPR from Cardiff City in an £8million deal

Excited: Caulker said the prospect of playing with Rio Ferdinand convinced him to join the club

Boss: He also says the draw of returning to play with Harry Redknapp once again was crucial to his decision

Survival: Caulker says the main aim for the club is to ensure safety this season by reaching 40 points

On the move: Steven Caulker has signed for QPR from Cardiff City in an £8million deal

Defensive duo: Caulker will play alongside Rio Ferdinand who has also signed for QPR

Caulker told the club's official website: 'Harry was a big factor for me, having worked with him at Tottenham.

 'Being able to play with Rio Ferdinand was also a big draw. He has been a role model for many years, along with Ledley King.

'Our first aim this season has to be to get to 40 points, to make sure we stay up.'

QPR are also poised to make their move for Troy Deeney of Watford.

Leicester yesterday offered £6.5m but that has been rejected.

A deal could be struck involving Leicester midfielder Andy King going the other way but Burnley and Swansea may yet re-enter the bidding for Deeney.

Watford have been encouraged by Fulham agreeing to pay Leeds up to £11m for Ross McCormack and Leicester up to £10m for Brighton’s Leonardo Ulloa.

Watford believe Deeney’s goalscoring record compares favourably with those two and hence will hold out for a similar price.

Further signings: Harry Redknapp's business is not finished there though, he wants Troy Deeney from Watford

In demand: Deeney is also a target for Premier League sides Burnley, Leicester and Swansea
