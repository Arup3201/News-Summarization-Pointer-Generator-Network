A female police lieutenant has been demoted after she sent sexually explicit videos and a raunchy photograph in her uniform to a lower-ranking officer, authorities said today.

Diana Lopez, who was a public information officer in Tucson, was in a relationship with the male officer at the time.

Police said on Monday that Lopez used her personal cell phone to send the videos and photos.

Lopez was reduced to the rank of sergeant following an investigation that began last August 2012. She now works in the operations division.

Anonymous letters sent to the police department about Lopez prompted the probe, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

A police report says Lopez's boyfriend apparently showed the videos and photos to other officers between May and August 2011.

It is believed that 13 people might have seen the footage - however no one admitted to it. The racy clips were never uncovered but there is 'no doubt they exist', authorities said.

Police say Lopez violated several department regulations, code of ethics and professional standards. They say a recommendation was made to reduce her in rank.

During the lengthy investigation, Lopez admitted to kissing an individual in a station locker room while at work.

The lower-ranking officer to whom Lopez sent the footage has not been identified. There is no suggestion that he will face disciplinary action although police spokesman Sgt Chris Widmer said the investigation was ongoing.

Lopez's attorney Michael Piccarreta said she is considering a civil lawsuit against the city or appealing the demotion.

He said that the case brought up constitutional issues over lawful off-duty behavior and violation of privacy.Â
