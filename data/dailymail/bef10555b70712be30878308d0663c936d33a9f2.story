Firefighters do some of the most dangerous work of all emergency services workers.

To save life and limb they fearlessly put themselves in harm's way - sometimes paying the ultimate price.

There are times, however, when no amount of courage will get the job done; when the risks are so great that attempting to rush in is likely to do more harm than good.

Tough: The Thermite remote-control firefighting 
robot which could save lives by battling blazes in conditions which are 
too dangerous for humans to get close

Compact: Propelled by durable caterpillar tracks able to traverse the most rugged terrain, the Thermite is designed to withstand conditions that would spell the end of other robots the same size

Now though, for those kinds of 
situations, firefighters have a robot ally who can operate in 
environments too hazardous for fragile humans to enter.

The makers of the Thermite remote control firefighter claim it is the world's first robot designed to help save lives by removing the human element from the dangers of disaster control.

It can be remote controlled from up to a quarter of a mile away, meaning that firefighters can close in on hazardous blazes and battle the flames with the high-pressure hose that spews up to 600 gallons a minute.

Propelled by durable caterpillar tracks able to traverse the most rugged terrain, the Thermite is designed to withstand conditions that would spell the end of other robots the same size.

The robot is small enough to enter through an average size door, allowing access to hitherto difficult to reach interior spaces, yet powerful enough to drag weights of up to 1,270lbs.

Invaluable tool: The robot is perfectly designed for dealing with those incidents that are too hazardous for human firefighters to get close too

Hand-made from A440f steel and aircraft grade aluminium in the U.S. by Maine-based Howe & Howe Technologies, the Thermite could herald a revolution in handling serious disasters and out-of-control fires.

Its makers say: 'The Thermite is a durable, compact, and self-contained fire-fighting and emergency response robot capable of handling situations and blazes that up to now needed to be tended rather than fought.

'From hazardous materials, chemical fires, train derailments or fuel farms, with this new tool the modern responder will not only be able to attack the problem, but can feel confident that their fire-fighters are safe doing so.

'By providing stand-off distance, remote capabilities, and a multi-directional monitor you can be assured that safety was and is our foremost concern.
