A 13-year-old Texas girl has died of influenza, taking this season's swine flu death toll to 17 in Dallas County alone.

Lydia Christine Kizziar of Carrollton was just a seventh grader when she passed away Saturday and her little sister is in the hospital fighting off the very same illness.

Lydia's circumstance is increasingly common. Texas has been hard-hit this year as swine flu, or H1N1, pummels the Southern U.S. and threatens Americans nationwide.

Tragic: 13-year-old Lydia Kizziar died Saturday, becoming the 17th confirmed person to die during this rampant flu season

Even as reports of infection and death tolls hit a steep rise, experts warn that the season is still on an upslope.

'It's too early to tell how severe it's going to be but we're still on the up slope of the flu season, so what we can expect is more flu, more intense disease and more deaths over the next few weeks,' Dr. Joe Bresee of the Center for Disease Control's influenze division said Sunday.

Flu season last each year from October to April and can peak in January or February.

Lydia Kizziar's tragic death came as her home state of Texas saw an uptick in flu cases.

Rampant: The Southern United States are among the hardest hit this year by influenza. The color brown indicates widespread flu activity. In Dallas County alone, 17 flu deaths have been reported since September

Swine flu: The 2013-2014 flu vaccine accounts for various strains of the virus, including H1N1, or the swine flu

According to NBCDFW.com, health officials in Dallas and Denton counties had by Tuesday confirmed 19 deaths.

While the very old and very young are usually the hardest hit by the flu, on Monday the Garland, Texas health department revealed that the two most recent mortalities were seen in patients under 50 with no other health conditions.

Elsewhere in Texas, 13 had been reported dead from the Houston area by last week.

The southern state of North carolina had also reported 13 deaths by last week. In South Carolina, nine have died since September.

While the south appears to be suffering the most, everyone needs to remain mindful of the threat.

Eye-opening: CDC data suggests the H1N1 strain, which became so virulent in the 2009-2010 season, is the predominant flu virus being spread this year

'The virus is all around the United States right now.,' said Bresee. 'There is still a lot of season to come. If folks haven't been vaccinated, we recommend they do it now.'

This season's virus has killed six children in the United States, according to CDC data.

A memorial fund has been set up for Lydia Kizziar in order to help her family financially through this painful time.

'The Kizziar family is in need of financial blessings to help with the cost of care and funeral expenses for the passing of their sweet, young daughter, Lydia,' the page on youcaring.com reads.

'They are unemployed, recently, and also their youngest daughter, Katie, is still in the hospital from the same illness that took their sweet Lydia.'
