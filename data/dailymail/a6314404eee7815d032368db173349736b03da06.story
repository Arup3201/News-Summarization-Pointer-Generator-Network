In a fitted grey dress and Louboutins with her baby daughter strapped to her chest, Tamara Ecclestone looked every inch the working mother at an exclusive lunch at New York's Per Se today.

The F1 heiress has stepped out in her own right to create her own luxury hair care range, Show Beauty.

And it seems the 30-year-old has successfully managed to mix motherhood with the challenges of running her own business on a three-week global tour to promote her brand.

Working mommy: Tamara Ecclestone, pictured with baby Sophia on their recent visit to Hong Kong, is successfully managing to juggle motherhood with her haircare empire

Family outing: Tamara, husband Jay Rutland and daughter Sophia took a stroll in New York's Central Park today

Little Sophia, eight months old, has her own monogrammed Goyard passport cover and has accompanied mommy to Hong Kong, San Francisco, Toronto and now New York City.

It is all the more impressive given that Tamara and husband Jay Rutland do not have a nanny.

But speaking to MailOnline – with Sophia gurgling away merrily throughout - Tamara said: 'Sophia has been amazing, we did have a few issues when we got to Hong Kong as she slept all day and was up all night, so I was up with her, but she's great – we're starting her in the business early!'

And Jay is a hands-on dad, she added. Sophia, who was wearing a soft cream cardigan and tights, was styled by her papa for the upscale do. 

Tamara joked: 'Daddy got her dressed today and didn't even know what way the tights went!'

Despite looking so svelte, she admits: 'I haven't stepped foot in a gym since she was born. It's the breastfeeding – it takes the pounds off you.'

It was in San Francisco that Tamara got the news that U.S. beauty emporium Sephora will be stocking her Show Beauty range nationwide. 

She said: 'I am so, so excited, all the hard work is paying off, it means to women everywhere can buy Show.' 

Show Beauty will be in Sephora from the New Year and is currently stocked in high-end stores such as Harrods in London and Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan.

As for the holidays, Tamara, the elder daughter of Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone and his ex-wife Slavica, admitted she can't wait for her younger sister Petra to move back to London.

On tour: The family had some time off in San Francisco where they enjoyed some sightseeing

Petra and her husband James Stunt, along with their young daughter Lavinia, have been living in Los Angeles, though, Tamara says, they will be returning to the UK for good soon.

Tamara said: 'It's been really sad, I've been so busy that I haven't seen Petra in three months, I cannot wait to see her.

'I'm so happy that our daughters will get to grow up together.

'It's going to be like me and Petra all over again, Sophia's a brunette and Lavinia is so blonde!'
