Nico Rosberg has paid tribute to Lewis Hamilton’s world championship triumph by declaring his rival as the ‘best driver on the grid this year’.

Rosberg’s dreams of winning his first Formula One title took a huge dent in the opening moments of the season finale when Hamilton stormed ahead of him off the line.

While Rosberg, who needed to win and hope Hamilton finish outside the top-two in order to triumph, kept his team-mate honest in the first phase of the season-ending race, mechanical gremlins then struck his Mercedes and he failed to finish in the points.

‘I am very disappointed. The chance was there today and it did not work out,’ said Rosberg, who limped home in 14th.

‘In the end my race did not make a difference because Lewis won the race fair and square. He deserved to win today and he deserved to win the championship.

‘This year he was that little bit better. He has done an amazing job and was the best driver on the gird this year.’

Lewis Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg tweeted that Mercedes were looking forward to their celebration party. 

'Now we fight out the partying championship!' he said.  

Rosberg and Hamilton’s relationship has boiled over on a number of occasions this year, most notably in Monaco, when the German was accused of deliberately scuppering Hamilton’s qualifying lap, and in Belgium when they collided.

But the Mercedes pair shared an emotional embrace after the race with Rosberg congratulating Hamilton on his triumph.

‘It was intense, but I am very proud to be a part of this moment,’ added Rosberg, who was extremely magnanimous in his defeat.

‘It has been special and it has been an incredible experience for me this weekend in terms of support.’
