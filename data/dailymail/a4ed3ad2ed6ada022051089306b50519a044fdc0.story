In the latest in a series of quality issues, Ford is recalling 465,000 cars and SUVs globally after more than 600 complaints from customers about leaky fuel tanks, which are a fire hazard.

The global recall affects the Fusion, Explorer, Taurus, Flex, Police Utility, Police Interceptor and the Lincoln MKS, MKT and MKZ models from the 2013 year.

About 390,000 of the vehicles are in 
the U.S., with another 23,000 in Canada and 7,600 in Mexico. The rest 
are in Europe, South America, Asia and other areas.

Popular model: The Ford Fusion has won accolades for the company but has been plagued by recalls for faulty parts and is one of the models involved in the latest recall of 2013 Ford vehicles

In a statement to the Detroit News, the company said the 'condition 
could result in customers detecting a fuel odor, or in some cases, 
observe evidence of a fuel leak on the ground.'

'While a fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source may result 
in a fire, there have been no reports of fires. We are not aware of any 
accidents or injuries attributed to this condition,' wrote Ford 
spokeswoman Kelly Felker.

Total recall: The Lincoln MKT was redesigned for 2013 and has 'a suite of significant improvements that match or exceed more expensive, imported luxury class competitors' but is one of the Ford models being recalled

New models: Lincoln promised seven new models over three years in 2011 - the recalled MKZ, MKS (pictured) and MKT are among the updated models

Ford has said it has a limited supply of
new fuel delivery modules to fix the fuel leak, so some Ford owners 
will have to wait until September to have their fuel tanks fixed.

Ford is also recalling 500 of its new
2013 Lincoln MKZ mid-size sedans - 100 in the U.S. and the rest in 
Canada - that are equipped with engine block heaters.

Sleek: The 2013 Ford Fusion is one of the company's most popular cars and boasts class-leading fuel economy, but also suffers possible gas leaks

The automaker says the insulation on 
the engine block heater electrical cord has the potential to crack in 
temperatures of minus four degrees or colder, which could potentially 
expose wiring,

It represents another blow for the 
mid-size Fusion sedan, which was redesigned last fall and is one of 
Ford's best-selling models, but has been the subject of several recalls 
since its launch.

In the stars: The Ford Taurus was first introduced in 1986 and has been in continuous production for more than 20 years. The 2013 version of the car is among those recalled for a faulty fuel tank

About 80,000 Fusions were 
recalled last December to check for engine leaks that could result in a 
fire. Another 19,000 Fusions were recalled in November to correct 
problems with the lighting system.

Ford CEO Alan Mulally said earlier 
this year the number of recalls wasnâ€™t a problem, but 
instead a sign that the venerable automaker was focused on quality.

'We learned 
from every one of them,' he said.

Fire risk: Ford says it has received 600 complaints about fuel leaks which could be a fire hazard, prompting the company to issue a recall of 465,000 cars around the world

In 2012, Ford recalled more than 1.4 million vehicles globally, and already this year there have been more than 700,000 recalls of Ford models.

These latest recalls come days after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was opening a preliminary investigation into 400,000 2011-2013 Ford F-150 trucks with 3.5 liter EcoBoost engines.

There have been 95 complaints alleging unexpected sharp reductions in engine power during hard acceleration at highway speeds.
