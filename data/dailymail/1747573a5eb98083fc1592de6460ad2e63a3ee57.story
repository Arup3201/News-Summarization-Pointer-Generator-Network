David Cameron was yesterday pushing for tougher sanctions to strike at the heart of Russia’s economy over its incursion into Ukraine – even if they risk hurting the City.

Downing Street admitted that targeting lending to sectors such as oil could have an impact on London’s financial heart.

But the Prime Minister’s spokesman said it was right to put pressure on President Vladimir Putin over his military aggression.

This may well have an impact on the financial sector in London and other capitals, he said. ‘But, as the Prime Minister and Chancellor have said, the costs of the sanctions fall much more greatly on Russia than they do on the rest of the world.

‘Russia needs Europe and others more than the other way around on these commercial issues.’

The development came as France finally bowed to pressure and cancelled the delivery of the first of two warships to Russia.

The Vladivostok, a Mistral-class helicopter carrier ordered in the £960million deal, was due to be delivered by late October.

French President Francois Hollande’s office called the fighting in Ukraine ‘grave’ and said that Russia’s recent actions in Ukraine harm ‘the foundations of security in Europe’.

Britain, France and Germany are all in favour of tougher EU sanctions if the Kremlin refuses to call off incursions into its smaller neighbour.

In Brussels, EU ambassadors have begun work on the new measures, including a threat to strip Russia of the right to host the 2018 football World Cup.

But the central proposal was a ban on all state-controlled oil and defence firms from raising capital in European markets.

This could have a dramatic effect by halting investment in these key sectors. The Russian economy is already stalling thanks to existing sanctions, and the rouble is at a record low.

A document in Brussels out- lining the plans added: ‘Besides economic measures, thought could be given to taking co-ordinated action to recommend suspension of Russian participation in high-profile international events (Formula One races, UEFA football competitions, 2018 World Cup etc).’

However, Number 10 officials suggested that Britain was less enthusiastic about the idea of trying to strip Russia of football’s top tournament.

‘The Prime Minister’s focus is around political and economic measures that have an impact now,’ said the spokesman.

Meanwhile President Barack Obama was yesterday in Estonia to reassure the Baltic states that they would be protected by Nato.

The US leader declared that ‘borders cannot be redrawn at the barrel of a gun’.

He also warned Mr Putin that the alliance would not accept Russian annexation of ‘any part of Ukraine’.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he has agreed a ‘ceasefire process’ with Moscow.

Later Mr Putin commented that he hoped a peace deal could be reached by tomorrow during talks in Minsk between his country, Ukraine and separatist rebels.

The Nato summit, which is being held in Wales today and tomorrow, is expected to discuss the alliance’s response to the crisis in Ukraine.
