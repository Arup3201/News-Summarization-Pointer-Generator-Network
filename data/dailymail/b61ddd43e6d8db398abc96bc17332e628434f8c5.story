Ever dream of living in a castle? If you’re looking for investment potential, you might be better off saving up for a parking space.

This 16th century Scottish castle, complete with turrets and a one-acre garden, is on the market for £375,000.

Which is £25,000 less than you’ll pay  for a parking space in some of the posher parts of West London, as witnessed by our example.

Kilmartin castle, just north of Lochgilphead in Scotland, has gone on sale for £375,000

At £400,000 the castle comes in at £25,000 cheaper than this parking space in Kensington, West London

A two-vehicle spot in the underground car park pictured far right will set you back £400,000, showing just how dramatic the real estate divide has become across the country.

Knight Frank, the estate agency which is selling the castle, said Scottish castles can fetch between £5million and £6million, but this three-bedroom version is the cheapest on its books.

The same money would buy you ‘the cupboard space of a flat in Knightsbridge or the downstairs of a small terraced house in Guildford, Surrey’, according to its research department.

The beautiful countryside surrounding the castle offers trout fishing, deer stalking, shooting, sailing and golf

From the basement of this car park the owner of the parking space might catch sight of a fox or pigeon

In fact, the same money plus a little bit more could make you the proud owner of a two-car parking space in a private garage in Kensington, West London, where the ‘average’ price of a home is £1.1million.

The castle, called Kilmartin, was bought by its current owners, an elderly couple who use it as a second home, in the 1980s. It was a ruin and they carried out extensive rebuilding and restoration.

The owners are such castle enthusiasts that at one point they owned three – two in Scotland and one in Cumbria.

The castle was bought as a ruin but the previous owners have brought the interior back to life

As well as an impressive interior, the castle comes with a one-acre garden and its own turrets

They sold off one of their Scottish castles last year and have decided that Kilmartin, which is north of Lochgilphead, Argyll, should also have a new owner.

The property offers easy access to salmon and trout fishing, deer stalking, game shooting, sailing and golf.

In Kensington, the closest you’ll get to sighting wildlife would be the glimpse of a hungry fox by night.

Michael Jones, a partner at Knight Frank, said many people had a romantic dream to live in a castle.

It could even appeal to a family looking for a new home. The local village of Kilmartin has a school, post office, a church and a hotel.

Other interest has been shown by people looking for a second home or renting it out as a holiday let.
