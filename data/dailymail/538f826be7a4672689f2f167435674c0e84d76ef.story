Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is fighting to improve the club's style of play, according to his compatriot Ronald de Boer.

United have come in for criticism for employing what some perceive as long-ball tactics despite spending £150million on new players last summer.

Ajax academy chief De Boer believes United have not yet come to terms with Van Gaal's preferred possession-based style, despite sitting fourth in the Premier League table.

Speaking on talkSPORT's Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show, De Boer said: 'Van Gaal is struggling a little bit at Manchester United. Not with the amount of points he's got, but with his style.'

'It's not the way he wants to play. He's fighting to get there. At the moment it's not the football that we are used to with Louis.'

United suffered their first defeat in five games on Saturday, going down 2-1 at Swansea after taking the lead through Ander Herrera.
