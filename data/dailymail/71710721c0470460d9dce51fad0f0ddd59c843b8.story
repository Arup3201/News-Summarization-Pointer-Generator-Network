Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women.

According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don’t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.'

Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website.

Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions

Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.'

But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece – such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet – have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop’s advice.

'Although not as "sexy" as "anti-inflammatory diets" and "magical cures", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website’s top tips.

And when it came to Ms Vlachonic’s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a ‘magical cure’ for morning sickness – while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation – Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims.

'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.'

Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages.

'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber.

'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' 

As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'.

She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion size' however, and recommends 'avoiding fast foods, overly processed foods, and sugared sodas'.

In regards to recommended weight gain, Dr Salber admits: 'There is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy.

'It depends on whether you are normal, over, or underweight to start with.'

'Normal weight women should gain between 25-35 pounds, underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds, and overweight between 15-25 pounds. Obese women should gain slightly less, between 11-20 pounds.

Other kernels of advice offered up by Ms Vlachonic in her recent Goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day, and plenty of time spent in the 'bathtub, a pool, or the sea.'

She even helpfully suggests: 'The crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you’re pregnant!' 

Repeat offender: Goop (pictured) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice, not to mention outrageously expensive products  

This is far from the first time Goop has been criticized for its questionable health advice. 

In January, Ms Paltrow came under fire for suggesting women partake in 'vaginal steams', which she said 'cleanse your uterus' and 'balance female hormone levels'.

This information was slammed by doctors, some who even suggested the practice might be harmful.

Just this week, Ms Paltrow defended herself in the face of long-standing criticism surrounding Goop's expensive and unattainable content.

Speaking to CNN Money, she said: 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers.

'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.'
