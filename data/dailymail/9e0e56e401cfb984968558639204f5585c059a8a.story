The infamous Milwaukee, Wisconsin serial killer dubbed the 'North Side Strangler' died Sunday after serving only three years of his seven consecutive life sentences.

Walter Ellis, 53, died at a Sioux Falls hospital Sunday from apparent natural causes according to officials at the South Dakota maximum-security prison where he was being held.

For two decades, Ellis terrorized the women of north Milwaukee. He wasn't arrested until 2009 when advances in DNA technology connected him to the murders of seven African-American prostitutes.

Ellis was able to remain free for so long because his DNA sample wasn't in a state database.

Ellis should have submitted a sample when he was serving time for beating his girlfriend with a hammer in 2001, but instead persuaded another inmate to give his DNA instead.

After investigators got an accurate sample from Ellis' toothbrush, they were able to match his DNA with semen found on six of the victims, as well as a pepper spray can discovered at the seventh scene.

In the end, prosecutors brought up first-degree murder charges for Ellis' first two victims - 31-year-old Deborah Harris on October 10, 1986, and 19-year-old Tanya Miller who was found dead the following day.

North side terror: Ellis killed 37-year-old Sheila Farrior (left)  in June 1995, and 28-year-old Florence McCormick (right) in April 1995. Like most of Ellis' victims, they were killed in north Milwaukee

Targeted: 41-year-old Joyce Mims (left) was found dead in June 1997. Ellis' final victim was Ouithreaun Stokes, 28 (right), in April 2007. All of the women Wllis was convicted of killing were African-American prostitutes

For the five victims that followed, Ellis was charged with intentional homicide. Those victims included Irene Smith, 25, in November 1992; Florence McCormick, 28, in April 1995; Sheila Farrior, 37, in June 1995; Joyce Mims, 41, in June 1997; and Ouithreaun Stokes, 28, in April 2007.

All of Ellis' victims were strangled to death, and one of them was also stabbed.

While Ellis originally plead 
not-guilty to the charges, he changed his plea on February 18, 2011 to 
no contest and was convicted of the seven killings.

Ellis
was handed seven life sentences for the crimes about a week later. The 
sentences were to be served consecutively without the possibility of 
parole.

Under investigation: Ellis' death is being investigated as is standard procedure

In addition to the crimes he was convicted of, police tied Ellis to additional slayings. One for another prostitute, 32-year-old Carron Kilpatrick, and for white runaway Jessica Payne, 16, in 1996.

Chaunte Ott actually spent 13 years in prison for Payne's murder, but was freed when DNA found on Payne matched that found on two of Ellis' victims.

Ellis didn't speak once during his trial, which left the reasoning behind the murders a mystery.

'Everyone wants to know why,' Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Dennis Cimpl said in February 2011. 'Unfortunately, Mr Ellis has the right not to tell us.'

But the justice process did offer a platform for Ellis' wide-range of victims to finally make peace with the deaths of their friends and family.

'He didn't only kill my sister, he killed my mother - she died of heartbreak after that,' said Zola Farrior, sister of Sheila Farrior who was killed in 1995.

Others took the trial as an opportunity to forgive Ellis.

'We're going to be all right,' said Patricia Donald, friend of Ellis' first victim Deborah Harris. 'You don't win. You don't get to destroy lives anymore.

While Ellis' death is believed to be from natural causes, the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation is still investigating  which is standard procedure.

He was being held at a South Dakota prison as part of an interstate deal with Wisconsin.
