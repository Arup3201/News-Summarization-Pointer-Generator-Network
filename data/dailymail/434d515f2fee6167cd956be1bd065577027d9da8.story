A Myanmar court has denied a New Zealand bar manager bail after he was arrested for allegedly insulting Bhuddism in Facebook marketing for his nightspot in the capital Yangon.

Philip Blackwood, general manager of the newly opened VGastro tapas bar and nightclub, posted a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page.

The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police on Wednesday, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up.

'They were trying to promote the bar. Buddha grabs people's interest... however, Buddhists cannot accept it,' a police official told reporters. 

The trio appeared in court on Thursday and were remanded in custody until the next hearing on December 18, when they will face two charges of breaching the country's Religion Act.

According to the Act, anyone who attempts to insult, destroy or damage any religion can be punished by a maximum of two years in jail, with another two-year penalty for those who try to insult religion through the written word.

'It is a no-bail offence,' Judge Ye Lwin said. 'We will give you the right of defence on December 18.'

Around 30 monks and 20 ordinary citizens gathered at the court on Thursday.

'The whole public was insulted by the posting of the improper Buddha photograph,' a monk called Thusita from the Burmese Patriot Monks Union told reporters.

'We will wait and see what action the authorities take. We will do what we need to, if the authorities do not take action,' he added.

The image was quickly removed from the Facebook page and replaced by an apology from VGastro Management expressing 'sincere regret' for having offended 'the citizens of this wonderful city.'

'Our ignorance is embarrassing for us,' read the statement. 

But the apology attracted a slew of angry comments from Burmese social media users including one which decried the bar management as 'utterly unprofessional and culturally insensitive.'

V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks ago. swiftly deleted the insulting image and posted this apology on its Facebook page

The arrests come as Myanmar grapples with a growing Buddhist nationalist movement, spearheaded by extremist monks who have urged boycotts of Muslim shops and proposed a raft of laws to restrict religious freedoms.

Their rise has accompanied several bouts of religious violence between Muslims and Buddhists.

The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country
