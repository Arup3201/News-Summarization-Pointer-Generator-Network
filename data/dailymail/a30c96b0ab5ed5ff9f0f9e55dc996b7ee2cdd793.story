Egypt has endured more than two years of deposed presidents and political deadlock. Countless leaders and commentators have claimed to have the answer to resolve widespread civil unrest.

But it is the wise words of a 12-year-old boy which appear to encapsulate the dissatisfaction felt by the thousands of protesters in Tahrir Square and beyond.

During a remarkable interview with TV station El Wady News, young Ali Ahmed denounces Muhammed Mursi's ousted government as a 'fascist theocracy'.

Speaking with authority: Ali Ahmed, aged 12, makes some insightful remarks to a TV station about the state of his country

Opinions: Asked about where he learned about politics, Ali said he listened to people and used his brain

Sensation: Ali's interview has already been viewed almost 1.4million times on YouTube

He also says that the previous regime was doomed from the beginning, arguing 'what is built on falsehood is false itself'.

His eloquent answers were first posted on YouTube on March 27 but the footage has recently become a hit among protesters and has now been viewed almost 1.4million times.

Ali begins by saying: 'We didn't get rid of a military regime to replace it with a fascist theocracy'.

When the interviewer remarks that she is not sure what a 'fascist theocracy' is herself, Ali expands: 'Fascist theocracy is when you manipulate religion and enforce extremist regulations in the name of religion'.

Surprised by Ali's knowledge of politics, the interviewer asks him where he learnt about such things.

'I
 just know it,' he replies. 'I listen to people a lot and use my brain. I
 read newspapers, watch TV and search on the internet.'

The outspoken Ali continues: 'All of this [political process] is void, because the parliament in the first place is void'.

Plan: Egypt's interim head of state has timetabled an election date for next year, leaving the country facing months of violent protests following the military ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi last week

He also criticised regulations adopted from the Islamic Shariah law as 'outrageous.' As an example, he says that allow men 'to discipline their wives'.

'I canâ€™t beat my wife up and almost kill her, and then tell you this is discipline. This is not discipline, this is abuse and insanity,' Ali adds.

Today ,Egypt's interim head of state timetabled an election date for next year, leaving the country facing 
months of violent protests  following the military intervention last week.

In an attempt to drag the Arab world's biggest country from crisis, a decree issued by Adli Mansour pointed to a parliamentary ballot within about six months with a presidential vote to follow.

But
 senior officials in Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood rejected the plans with 
leading figure Essam al-Erian saying the blueprint for constitutional 
changes 'brings the country back to square one'.

The events have worried Western 
allies. The United Nations said it was 'gravely concerned' about 
mounting violence in Egypt and said the country was on a 'precarious 
path.'

'The Secretary-General condemns these 
killings and calls for them to be thoroughly investigated by independent
 and competent national bodies,' it said in a statement.

The United States, still refraining 
from calling the military intervention a 'coup' - a label that would 
trigger legal obstacles to continuing aid payments - called on Egypt's 
army to exercise 'maximum restraint.'

The White House said it was not about to halt aid to Egypt.

The Egyptian military, recipient of 
$1.3 billion a year from Washington, has insisted that the overthrow was
 not a coup and that it was enforcing the 'will of the people' after 
millions took to the streets on June 30 to call for Morsi's resignation.
