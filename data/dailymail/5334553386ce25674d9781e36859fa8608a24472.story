Sir Alex Ferguson provided Angel Di Maria with his man-of-the-match award after last night's Champions League final.

The legendary Manchester United boss was on hand to dish out the gong to the Real Madrid star after he inspired the Spanish giants to their dramatic 4-1 win over neighbours Atletico Madrid in Lisbon.

It capped a memorable few hours for Ferguson after part of his wine collection sold for more than £2million at an auction on Saturday.

Under the hammer: Part of Ferguson's wine collection sold for over £2million at an auction on Saturday

The wines were offered at a sale in Hong Kong in the first of three auctions and fetched a sale total of £2,269,065. A total of 257 lots were offered and 229 lots were sold.

The top lot was one Methuselah - equivalent to eight bottles - of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Vintage 1997 which sold for £94,815. This lot included a card signed 'Best Wishes Alex Ferguson'.

Ferguson was known for his good taste in wine, and often enjoyed a post-match glass with his opposing manager during his 26-year reign at Old Trafford.

'My interest in wine began during a scouting trip in France and, over time, my enjoyment of discovery and collecting grew,' said Ferguson.

'The importance of collecting wine was that it served as a distraction and gave me a balance in my life that helped me in dealing with the intensity and demands required of me as the manager of Manchester United.

'In retirement, I now have the time to visit the places and people that will feed my passion, so I felt it made sense to release a large number of the wines I had collected over the years. I hope many will enjoy exploring my collection.'
