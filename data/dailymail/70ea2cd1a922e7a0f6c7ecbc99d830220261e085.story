Banksy artworks controversially ripped from public view amid cries of theft is to go under the hammer in the biggest ever sale of its kind.

The mutli-million auction will include No Ball Games, taken from the side of a shop in north London last July.

The sale will also feature Liverpool Rat, taken from a boarded up pub in Liverpool last year.

Vandalised: No Ball Games was created in September 2009 in Tottenham Green, north London, and had been repeatedly defaced until it was removed in 2013

Striking: The Liverpool Rat, Britain's biggest creation by Banksy, was painted on The White Horse pub, on the edge of the city's China Town on Berry Street in 2006 where it remained until it was removed in 2013

Other works up for sale include Old Skool, taken from an east London garage, Sperm Alarm, daubed on a hotel wall, and Silent Majority, sprayed on a trailer at Glastonbury festival.

The Hackney work Balloon Girl and 2 Rats from Berlin will also feature at Stealing Banksy? event, which will see the works go on display for four days from April 24 to 27.

The exhibition and auction will be at the ME London Hotel, in The Strand, in the centre of the capital, with limited tickets available to the public.

For sale: Banksy's 'Old Skool' work, pictured, which was removed from the wall of an east London garage is going under the hammer in April

Stolen: Banksy's 'Sperm Alarm' was stolen from a wall of the four-star Hesperia Hotel in Victoria in 2011 then recovered

Early work: Silent majority was painted onto the outside of an 'Overlander' semi-trailer at the Glastonbury festival in 1998

It is being organised by Sincura Group, which has handled the controversial removal and sale of a number of Banksy pieces in recent years.

The company said: 'Stealing Banksy? is the 2014 project exploring the social, legal and moral issues surrounding the sale of street art.

'The exhibition showcases the most expensive collection of Banksy artworks ever assembled under one roof and is the culmination of a 12 month project to uncover, salvage and lovingly restore these pieces that have shaped the capital we live in.'

Unique: Banksy's '2 Rats' was created in Berlin on the corner of Kopernicker and Adalbert Strabe when Banksy participated in a local art festival in 2003

Recovered: The Girl with the Red Balloon in Hackney was covered from view for the last decade until it was removed in 2013

The company said No Ball Games is likely to fetch more the £1million with the money being donated to charities.

It added: 'Having been carefully sourced from around the world, over £5 million of the most controversial artwork will be on display.

'The show will be the first and only time these pieces will ever be seen in their fully restored state.'

Is this Banksy? A man in blue overalls was shot near a work in progress in New York last year

Reclusive graffiti artist Banksy has managed to pull off an incredible trick; keeping his true identity a secret despite worldwide curiosity about the man behind the spray can.

He has apparently been caught on camera overseeing the creation of one of his artworks in New York.

A man in a flat cap and paint-spattered overalls was photographed trying to fix a 'moving painting' in a van which had broken down, as part of the artist's month-long 'exhibition' in the U.S, last year.

But no one has yet been able to confirm his identity.

The artist's real name is thought to be either Robin Banks or Robin Gunningham, but all that is known for sure is that he is from Bristol.

Previously photographs purporting to show Banksy were taken in Santa Monica in 2011 and East London in 2007.

Both images feature a white man in his 30s of average build with brown hair - making them compatible with the latest image, which was taken in the East Village neighbourhood of Manhattan.

Banksy, whose work has been painted on the sides of buildings around Bristol, London and other cities, has always insisted he will never reveal his true identity.
