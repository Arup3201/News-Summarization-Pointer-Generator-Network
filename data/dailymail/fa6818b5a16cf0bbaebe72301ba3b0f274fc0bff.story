These amazing underground pictures are of an elaborate cave system in south Wales.

Caver turned photographer Joshua Bratchley, 22, took this stunning collection of images of the Dan yr Ogof cave system - including one that looks like the opening sequence to the James Bond films.Â 

Elsewhere giant stalactites hang from the ceiling with one meeting a stalagmite - making a tower.

Growth: Photographer Joshua Bratchley took these pictures of some enormous stalactites in the south Wales cave system

Close up: The 22-year-old photographer is also a keen caver and have been exploring such systems for many years

Meanwhile, several deep pools can be seen - with one intrepid caver wading in up to their waist.

The photographer is a keen caver himself and only recently began to combine this with photography.

He said: 'I began to combine the two and I found that I was very passionate about capturing these sensational places in my own images.

'It often takes a lot of thought to get the right lighting since the caves are naturally pitch black so seeing good results from efforts as thoroughly rewarding.

Reach: This photograph shows the very beginnings of some tiny stalagmites, created from water and other minerals

'My favourite photo is the one in Bakerloo straight, although people have taken other similar images before, I like how in this one the steam from the silhouetted caver rises in the light.

'I'd made many trips in to the cave before but had not taken enough time to admire its beauty so I took a camera with me to capture it in my records.

'It is a stunning system.'
