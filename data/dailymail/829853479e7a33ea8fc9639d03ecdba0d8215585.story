Shelly Sterling is reviewing five bids for the LA Clippers which could see the team sell for up to $2billion, it has been claimed.

Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Oprah Winfrey, former Clippers player Grant Hill and Steve Jobs' widow Laurene are all reported to be in the running

Shelly, wife of disgraced Clippers' owner Donald Sterling, is racing to offload the team before the NBA votes to force a sale on Tuesday next week, meaning the couple would get less favourable terms.

A source close to the bidding process said the sale price 'appears to be 
increasing to an unbelievable number,' adding that it could soar past the expected $1.5billion 
to $2 billion, and possibly more.

The deal is set to smash league records for the most expensive NBA franchise ever sold, beating the $550million paid for the Milwaukee Bucks earlier this month.

Another person familiar with the negotiations said Shelly Sterling's attorneys, bankers and others involved in the process were in a locked room reviewing the bids, which were due by 2 p.m. PDT Wednesday.

According to the LA Times, Steve Ballmer, thought to be worth $20billion, is leading one bid, with another group including basketball star Grant Hill, Bruce Karsh, minority owner of the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, and Tony Ressler, minority owner of baseball’s Milwaukee Brewers.

A third group includes Oracle software co-founder Larry Ellison, entertainment magnate David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey.

According to ESPN that group has now added Chicago-based Guggenheim Partners - who had previously partnered with Magic Johnson - Steve Jobs widow Laurene Jobs, Steve Wynn ex-wife Elaine Wynn, and Beats by Dre co-founder Jimmy Iovine.

A fourth offer is expected to come from bidders backed by Middle Eastern investors, though less is known about this group.

Potential buyers are thought to be offering up to 80 per cent of their bid in cash in order to simplify the deal, while another source suggested they are also being asked for deposits of £300million.

However, Donald Sterling's attorney Bobby Samini, has caused some confusion by saying there would be no sale of the team without Donald Sterling's involvement.

Donald was fined $2.5million and banned from the NBA after he was recorded making racist comments

It was reported that Shelly was authorised to sell 100 per cent of the franchise on behalf of her husband.

A letter dated May 22, written by one of Sterling's attorneys and signed by him stated: 'Donald T. Sterling authorizes Rochelle 
Sterling to negotiate with the National Basketball Association regarding
 all issues in connection with a sale of the Los Angeles Clippers team.'

However, the latest comment has raised fears that Donald is simply using the bidding process to establish a value for the team, before suing the NBA for that amount in damages if they force him to sell.

NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the league's advisory/finance committee met Wednesday by phone to discuss the separate responses from Donald and Shelly Sterling to the NBA on its efforts to end the Sterlings' ownership of the Clippers.

An source close to the NBA said that the league's owners know a sale couldn't be completed by next Tuesday, but if an agreement was in place, the NBA would give the Sterlings extra time before holding any meetings.

The individual said the league hopes a voluntary sale would remove the potential of legal action being taken by the Sterlings.

They added that at this point, with Donald Sterling saying he plans to fight the matter in court, the NBA intends to go forward with the meeting in New York on June 3.

A forced sale would require approval by three-fourths of the league's 30 owners. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said he is confident he would get the necessary votes.

On Tuesday, Donald Sterling issued a fiery response to the league's attempt to oust him.

The league is accusing him of damaging it and its merchandising partners with his racist comments released in a recording released last month.

Donald argued that there is no basis for stripping him of his team because his statements were illegally recorded 'during an inflamed lovers' quarrel in which he was clearly distraught.'

According to the response, Sterling says girlfriend V. Stiviano recorded him without his knowledge, which is illegal under California law.

He also said he could not have 'willfully' damaged the league because he did not know it would be made public.

'We do not believe a court in the United States of America will enforce the draconian penalties imposed on Mr. Sterling in these circumstances, and indeed, we believe that preservation of Mr. Sterling's constitutional rights requires that these sham proceedings be terminated in Mr. Sterling's favor,' the response said.

Donald Sterling was banned for life and fined $2.5 million by NBA commissioner Adam Silver after the recording was made public.

It is possible Shelly Sterling could complete an expedited sale of the team despite her husband's legal wranglings, according to Daniel Lazaroff, director of the Sports Law Institute at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

He said: 'She would have to be willing to go through with a sale that gave her absolutely no retained ownership interest in order to satisfy the league.

'If she did that, I don't think the league would stand in her way. If she wants to retain any portion of ownership it wouldn't work.'

Even if Shelly Sterling accepts an offer, the league has the right to approve potential owners, a lengthy process that would almost certainly not be completed by next Tuesday.

'The best case scenario is she finds a suitable buyer,' Lazaroff said. That would work for the league and from a financial standpoint that would work for the Sterlings.

'If the sale price is satisfactory, the smart thing might be to just get out. He's a businessman who understands buy low and sell high.'

Donald Sterling purchased the Clippers for $12 million in 1981, making him the league's longest-tenured owner.

Lazaroff noted that Sterling signed the NBA's constitution when he joined the league, and its bylaws spell out specific procedures for terminating ownership.

He said as long as the league follows its own rules it should be on solid legal ground.

'I could see a happy ending to this,' Lazaroff added, 'but it will depend on both of the Sterlings being out of the picture.'
