The seven young actors who became part of cinematic history when they were cast as the von Trapp children in Rogers & Hammerstein's The Sound Of Music in 1965 have grown to become lifelong friends in the fifty years since the famous film's release. 

Known as The SoM 7, they formed their own sort of family over the months of making the musical. Their parents befriended one another as the young performers traveled to Austria for filming, and the actors themselves have remained close for decades.

'We're beyond friends. We're second family,' said Kym Karath, who played the youngest von Trapp, Gretl. 'As adults, we were deeply bonded, so our lives have really interwoven with each other.'

As The Sound Of Music celebrates its 50th anniversary, here's a look at what the SoM 7 are doing now:
