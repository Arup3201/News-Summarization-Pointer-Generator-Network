New dad Craig Mahon capped the most unforgettable week of his life by scoring the goal that earned Conference side Chester a shock 2-1 win at League Two high-fliers Southend.

Mahon, whose partner had given birth to twins on Friday, provided a moment of Cup magic with the winner at Roots Hall.

The Chester winger rifled a low 25-yard shot in the 51st minute past home keeper Daniel Bentley to book the Blues their place in the second round draw tomorrow. 

Stefan Payne celebrates scoring Dover's winner against Morecambe in the first round of the FA Cup

Delighted Chester boss Steve Burr, who has previously guided Northwich and Kidderminster to the third round, said: ‘I said to the lads they could be heroes.’

Dover, also from the Conference, also beat League Two opponents, pipping Morecambe 1-0 at The Crabble. Former Fulham youngster Stefan Payne’s fifth goal of the season separated the sides.

But Dover boss Chris Kinnear was not surprised. He said: ‘There’s not much of a gap between our division and League Two and this place is a fortress.’

Southport, another Conference outfit, will also be optimistic of springing a replay surprise after their 0-0 draw at Dagenham.

Dartford advanced into the second round for the first time in 30 years after winning a thriller 4-3 at neighbours Bromley.

Bromley, of the Conference South, had twice come from behind to draw level but Tom Bradbrook followed his brother Elliot on to the scoresheet with an 81st-minute winner.

Ben Strevens was Eastleigh’s hero as The Spitfires moved into the second round for the first time with a 2-1 win against Conference rivals Lincoln.

Hemel Hempstead of the Conference South were dreaming of bridging a 61-step gulf in the pyramid when they took a 10th-minute lead at Bury through James Potton. But Bury hit back to win 3-1 though impressed boss David Flitcroft said: ‘I thought they were inspirational. A credit to themselves and their manager.’

Barnet’s hopes of a shock against Wycombe were undone when midfielder Sam Togwell, who was on loan at Wycombe last season, was sent off in the first half. Aaron Pierre and Sam Wood went on to score for Wycombe who came from behind to win 3-1, while Barnet finished the game with nine men after Andy Yiadom was also dismissed.

Tranmere must have feared they would be on the wrong end of an upset when George Donnelly was sent off at home to Bristol Rovers, but Micky Adams’ men held on for a 1-0 victory.

Basingstoke boss Jason Bristow says his side can go to AFC Telford and win after fighting back to claim a 1-1 draw at home.

Chris Flood earned the Conference South outfit a replay five minutes into the second half after Rod McDonald’s free-kick had put the Conference’s bottom side ahead in the 18th minute.

Bristow said: ‘There is a lot of belief in the side and good characters and the only disappointment is that we didn’t win but we will be in a confident mood heading into the replay.’

Byron Harrison scored a hat-trick as League Two side Cheltenham thrashed 10-man Swindon 5-0.

It was the third season running that Leag ue One Swindon have lost to lower-League opposition, though they were fuming over the dismissal of Nathan Thompson which turned the tie.

Swindon were trailing to Harrison’s opener when Thompson was sent off for the third time this season for what referee Carl Boyeson decided was a professional foul on Terry Gornell.

‘It was comical and I thought it was a joke at first when I saw the red card come out,’ said Swindon boss Mark Cooper. ‘For me it wasn’t even a foul.’

Gornell then added a second before Harrison struck twice more, either side of a 20-yarder from Matt Richards, to send Cheltenham into round two.

East Thurrock travelled north to Hartlepool in style — the Essex minnows were loaned the use of the West Ham team bus for the day — but their Cup run is over courtesy of a 2-0 defeat. A Jonathan Franks double ensured a first win for new Hartlepool manager Paul Murray.

‘We have played five or six games to get here and it is a great achievement for the club,’ said proud Thurrock boss John Coventry.

Conference North side Fylde’s long trip south to Plymouth also failed to produce a fairytale ending as they lost 2-0.

A late substitution proved costly for League One side Fleetwood as they crashed 1-0 at their League Two hosts Cambridge. Fleetwood boss Graham Alexander’s decision to bring on Jamie Proctor backfired as he was sent off 11 minutes later for violent conduct. Kwesi Appiah punished them by scoring Cambridge’s winner.
