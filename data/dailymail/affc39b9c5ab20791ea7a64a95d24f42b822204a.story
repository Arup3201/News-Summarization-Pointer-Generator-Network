Derek McInnes has shot down suggestions he would be willing to abandon Aberdeen to replace Ally McCoist at troubled Rangers.

And the manager who has revitalised the Pittodrie club took a veiled dig at the current Ibrox regime by declaring: ‘There’s a lot to be said about being happy at your work and I’m extremely happy here.’

Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne admitted this week that McInnes is bound to be attracting covetous glances after leading the club to their first silverware in 19 years with last season’s League Cup triumph - but he still expects the former Rangers midfielder to stay with the Dons.

And, despite speculation about a return to Govan, McInnes insisted that he and No 2 Tony Docherty are perfectly content to remain with a team who are currently one point off second place in the Premiership and with a League Cup semi-final to come against Dundee United.

‘I think (talk about the Rangers job) is unfair. There is still a manager in place at that club, he’s a friend of mine as well,’ said the 43-year-old.

‘I have no desire to leave Aberdeen at the minute. I’m really enjoying myself here and I feel we have work to finish.

‘There’s a lot to be said about being happy at your work and I’m extremely happy here.

‘The chairman and I speak on a regular basis and we have the same aspirations for the club. We have just started something and as good as things are at the minute we still feel there is a lot of improvement to come both on and off the pitch.

‘I have a really special relationship with him, a helluva lot of respect for him and I love my job here. And Tony would echo that as well.’

McInnes, meanwhile, has praised Shay Logan for his handling of the racism row with Celtic’s Aleksandar Tonev.

Bulgarian international winger Tonev this week lost his appeal against a seven-match suspension for racially abusing the Dons defender during a match at Celtic Park in September.

McInnes has been impressed by the way Logan has refused to let the three-month saga affect the quality of his performances on the pitch. And the Dons boss called on all parties to ‘move on’ after hoping the appeal verdict can draw a line under the affair.

‘We can’t comprehend how much pressure Shay has felt under the scrutiny of it all but he has never allowed his performances to dip,’ said McInnes.

McInnes said he is 'extremely happy' in his role with Aberdeen and is not looking to move

‘That says a lot for him but he is a confident, bubbly boy and very popular with everybody here. He loves his football and is committed to us. He loves being at Aberdeen, loves his training and is a very popular player.

‘Getting the full support from everyone at the club was important to him and rightly so.

‘We have always supported him, just as we would support any of our players or employee who had been wronged.

‘Now Shay and everyone else at the club just wants to move on and talk about football. I am delighted we can draw a line under it and now the appeal has been completed I think we can all move on now.’

McInnes also praised Shay Logan for the way he handled the fallout from the Aleksandar Tonev issue

In happier events off the pitch, Aberdeen this week announced an agreement to wipe the club’s historic debt of £14.5million. The club will now press ahead with building a new training ground at Bridge of Don in time for next season, while plans to move to a new 21,0000-seater stadium at Loirston Loch will be revisited.

Despite those developments, Milne indicated that money would not be available for transfers in January and McInnes backed his chairman’s decision.

He said: ‘The debt has hung about the club for so long and this does give us an opportunity to maximise where we are as a club. But we reiterate the chairman’s words – it doesn’t mean all of a sudden everything is rosy in the garden and we can start splashing cash everywhere.

‘I know what I have to work with. We have used the budget well this year and we have to continue to do that.’
