Radio 1 listeners were given a rude awakening this morning when one of Nick Grimshaw's guests swore live on air.

The Breakfast Show host was interviewing Milan Neil Amin-Smith of the pop group Clean Bandit when the expletive was broadcast before 8am.

The musician was asked about whether he was looking forward to performing live on the station when he replied 'hopefully we won't f*** it up'.

The Cambridge-based band were formed in 2006 but shot to fame last year after the release of their single, Mozart's House. In January this year, their track Rather Be topped the UK chart.

After being included in the latest re-making of the Band Aid track, they've been invited to record a song for Radio 1's popular segment, Live Lounge, in which top acts produce an acoustic cover of one of their or another band's biggest hits.

Nick Grimshaw asked Amin-Smith about the plans in an interview broadcast at about 7.55am this morning.

The violinist replied: 'We've flown back specially from Germany so hopefully we won't f*** it up.'

The Radio 1 DJ quickly interjected in a bid to cover up the expletive and later apologised to listeners,  who later took to Twitter to comment.

Alf Brawn tweeted: 'Clean Bandit has just said f*** on the phone to Nick Grimshaw at 7:54am amazing.'

Kevin Blairski wrote: 'Oh dear oh dear oh dear, who was that saying "f*** it up" live on @R1Breakfast? Clean Bandit! No idea who he is, but he's gained a fan!'

And website user C Sagz added: 'The irony of "Clean" Bandit swearing on @BBCR1 is just fantastic!'

The broadcast sparked a rash of mockery online, with some users suggesting the swear word could be good for the band's notoriety

The live interview was broadcast more than 13 hours before the traditional 9pm watershed, although BBC policy states that the watershed does not apply to radio.

The corporation's website states: 'The BBC does not ban words or phrases. However, it is the responsibility of all content makers to ensure strong language is used only where it is editorially justified.

'Even on radio, where there is no watershed, editorial teams should be conscious that certain slots are associated with particular types of content an appropriate scheduling is important for stronger content.'
