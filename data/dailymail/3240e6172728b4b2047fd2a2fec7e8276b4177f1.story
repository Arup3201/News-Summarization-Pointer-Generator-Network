THE mother of 11 handed a £400,000 six-bedroom house on the taxpayer made the last years of her former neighbour’s life hell, her son claimed yesterday.

Heather Frost’s family maintained a campaign of harassment, verbal abuse and vandalism against Doreen Freeman, it is alleged.

Dr James Freeman has revealed a series of harrowing diary entries written by his mother, which detail the horrors of living next to the Frosts.

'Nasty neighbour': Harrowing extracts from the diary of late widow Doreen Freeman (left) today revealed how jobless mother-of-11 Heather Frost (right) and her unruly children allegedly 'ruined the last years of her life'

Disturbing: Mrs Freeman, 81, detailed her claims that Frost's family (pictured) smashed up her greenhouse with iron bars, burned a soiled mattress outside her property and threw excrement into the garden

The log reports how the widow’s greenhouse was smashed and excrement was thrown into her garden.

While she was forced to endure the 
Frosts’ loud music and television viewing day and night, Mrs Freeman was
cowed into watching her own television with the sound off for years. Dr
Freeman, 63, said: ‘Heather Frost was the absolute pits. My mother was 
scared to death and that woman ruined the last years of her life.’

Mrs Freeman lived next to Frost in 
Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, for four years until the family moved on in
2006. She died two years later, aged 81.

She had been urged to keep a diary by 
her son and Severn Vale Housing Association after complaining about the 
family’s behaviour.

It detailed constant noise from next door, including verbal abuse shouted through her letterbox.

Distressing reading: Extracts from Mrs Freeman's diary reveal how she was forced to turn the sound off on her TV because of the incessant noise next door. She also claims the children 'are left to what they like'

'Continual noise': In these sections, Mrs Freeman complains of 'endless' banging, before writing that it had gone on for 'over two years'

Claims: Despite being subjected to a constant noise from next door, Frost's kids would bang on the wall if she ever dared to turn on her TV and shout abuse through her letterbox

Worried sick: Despite being subjected to a constant noise from next door, Frost's kids would bang on the wall if she ever dared to turn on her TV and shout abuse through her letterbox

A greenhouse cherished by her late 
husband Neville, a Second World War veteran who died in 1988, was 
smashed with iron bars in the back garden of her home, she stated.

Complaining directly to Frost appears 
to have been out of the question – in one extract, Mrs Freeman wrote 
that her neighbour ‘came to my house banging on my front door ... she 
told me to stop giving her children ****ing 20 questions’ and left 
‘shouting abuse’.

Frost refused to comment yesterday 
about the alleged abuse. She will move into her new six-bedroom property
in July, after complaining about her current home, which consists of 
two adjacent properties joined by the council with a connecting door.

Officials warned her about her 
behaviour on at least two occasions, in April 2002 and March 2003. In 
one letter to Mrs Freeman, a housing association worker wrote: ‘I have 
told Mrs Frost that she must stop all members of her family from 
throwing rubbish and excrement into neighbours’ gardens ... also that 
she must stop burning mattresses and rubbish in the rear garden.’

Current home not big enough: The council has 
knocked through two houses to create a larger one for Frost family, who 
have lived there for five years, but she insisted on getting an even 
bigger one

Trashy: The back of their current home in Churchdown, Gloucester

Deal: Tewkesbury Borough Council bosses have sold a plot of land in Northway Lane, Tewkesbury, for around £210,000. In return, the housing provider is building the six-bed super-house along with 12 other homes

Mrs Freeman lived at the property from
when it was built in 1951 until her death in 2008. Her son Dr Freeman, a
lecturer at the University of Manchester, said she became ‘a prisoner 
in her own home’ because of the Frosts.

‘She was so desperate to hold on to that house even though everything around her was turning bad.’

He added that his mother ‘was living 
in a war zone’ and subjected to ‘sickening’ barrages of abuse. ‘I said 
to her at the time she should keep a diary for evidence, but I didn’t 
know she actually did.

‘After she died, I found it in a pile of papers and when I finally read it I broke down in tears.

‘I went to Severn Vale several times and told them something needed to be done, but my requests fell on deaf ears.’

A spokesman for the housing 
association, which is re-homing Frost and her children, said it 
‘endeavours to enforce our anti-social behaviour policy’.

Courtesy of the taxpayer: Despite being well aware of her abusive behaviour, the housing association has still rewarded her with this brand new six-bedroom home, which is currently being built

Spacious: The house comes with six bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen/ diner and two bathrooms

Grand designs: The plans for the family's plush new eco-home which the council has agreed to build

Controversy: Frost (pictured with Page, 11, Till, three, and Daisy, five) provoked a furious reaction when it emerged last month she is soon to be handed the keys to a purpose-built 'eco-home' to house her huge family
