Allegations: Eric Schneiderman, 59, has admitted to using marijuana and cocaine during his youth but denied taking any illegal drug since he entered the Senate in 1999

New York's Attorney General is facing fresh questions over his alleged partying lifestyle after a political activist claimed he snorted cocaine in the backroom of a bar while serving as a state senator.

Eric Schneiderman, 59, has admitted to using marijuana and cocaine during his youth but denied taking any illegal drug since he entered the Senate in 1999.

However, Democratic activist and comedian Randy Credico has claimed in his memoir that he witnessed Schneiderman snort 'bumps' of cocaine during a party at Manhattan's Siberia nightclub in 2005. 

'I saw him, Schneiderman, put it up his nose, a white powder' insisted Credico in a memoir he hopes to publish, according to the New York Post.

The pair worked together during the 2000s in successfully reforming The Rockefeller Drug Laws - state statutes that deal with the sale and possession of 'narcotic' drugs.

The alleged incident happened, Credico claimed, during a reception for politicians and their supporters. Siberia has since shut down.

'Schneiderman was there, and everybody was using like a bump or two bumps of cocaine . . . We were all snorting there, everyone was in the back room using white powder,' contended Credico, who received more than 20,000 votes as a long-shot candidate in the Democratic primary for governor last month.

He claimed there were about a dozen other people in the room but could not recall who they were, the Post stated. 

Credico, who was such good friends with Scheiderman at the time that he even MC'd his 50th birthday party. 

But he says he decided to make his accusations public after seeing a recent re-election campaign advert in which Schneiderman lauds his role in 'breaking up statewide drug-trafficking rings.'

He went on: 'The AG is going after Mickey Mouse drug offenders . . . when he was once totally opposed to the drug laws,' Credico allegedly wrote.

Claims: However, Democratic activist and comedian Randy Credico has claimed in his memoir that he witnessed Schneiderman snort 'bumps' of cocaine during a party at Manhattan's Siberia nightclub in 2005

Peter Adjemian, a spokesman for Schneiderman, called the allegation 'categorically false.'

'The attorney general and Mr. Credico crossed paths a number of times during 2005, when they were both supporting [Manhattan] District Attorney [Robert] Morgenthau's re-election campaign, and Mr. Credico performed stand-up comedy at the attorney general's 50th birthday party,' the rep said.

'But what's truly laughable — and absolutely, unequivocally false — is the notion that these two individuals ever did drugs together.'
