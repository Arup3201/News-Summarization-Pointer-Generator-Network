Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has urged England’s youngsters to widen their football horizons by playing overseas.

The Belgium central defender, who yesterday confirmed he has signed a new five-year contract with City, also believes England will play in a World Cup final by 2030.

Belgium are emerging as one of European football’s leading nations, boasting talent such as Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Jan Vertonghen. Their emergence as a world force is in stark contrast to England’s recent decline.

Hard-earned: Kompany says he owes a lot of his success to moving abroad at a young age

While Belgians have moved around the world to further their careers, British professionals seem content to stay at home. 

Now 28-year-old Kompany, who left Hamburg for City when he was 22, believes England’s most talented youngsters can only benefit from spending time out of their comfort zone.

Kompany believes the problem is down to the English mindset, and says: ‘If you ask a kid at 17, go play in League One or go and play in the first division in Holland, 90 per cent will go for League One.

‘Open the borders in your head. It is not just an opportunity, it is also education.’

Kompany adds: ‘What has made my development is not the fact that I started in the (Belgian) premier league at 17 or 18. It is the fact that I started at Anderlecht at 17 and played Champions League at 17 and moved on when I was 20.

Early start: Kompany was playing Champions League football from a young age when at Anderlecht

Champion: Kompany has won two Premier League titles since joining Manchester City in 2008

‘That made a difference for players like me, Eden Hazard, Vertonghen, (Mousa) Dembele — all the players in my national team. We started at smaller clubs. 

'English players should accept at a younger age to take experience abroad or in leagues where it is easier to play. They need to be more prepared to go for that experience and then come back.’

England’s poor showing in the World Cup has merely underlined their fading status on the world stage but Kompany insists he can see signs of a resurgence.

‘People talk about the great facilities in England but they’ve only been here for two to three years,’ he says. 

‘You have to wait. England will play a World Cup final in the next four competitions for the simple reason that no other country has the resources to put that much into facilities.

Committed: David Silva and Yaya Toure have both joined Kompany in committing their future to City

‘It’s simple. You (England) rest on your laurels a little because you have had success for so long, then you get a slap like the last World Cup and it makes you progress 10 years.

‘It was a very important slap, one that will make English players reach another level.’

On his new deal, Kompany adds: ‘The main thing is not so much that I’ve signed but that I see David Silva signing, Samir Nasri, (Aleksandar) Kolarov, Yaya Toure... It’s a huge sign of commitment. 

'All those could have played for the top three clubs in the world but they believe in the City project.

In control: Kompany says England will make one of the next four World Cup finals because of their resources

‘I don’t see any club who can honestly say every season they are going to compete for as many trophies as we are. 

'In the Champions League, three clubs — Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona — are a step ahead of everyone. That was the case in the Premier League. It was Liverpool, United, Arsenal, Chelsea.

‘That has been changed — and now I would like nothing more than to upset the order in Europe.’
