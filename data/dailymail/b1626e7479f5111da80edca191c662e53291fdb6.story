A daredevil's planned jump off the summit of Mount Everest has been cancelled following outrage at his plans to go ahead with the stunt after his team of Sherpas were killed in an avalanche on the mountain. 

Joby Ogwyn planned to film his attempt to become the first person to jump from the top of Mount Everest and fly down to Base Camp in a wingsuit for the Discovery Channel who were sponsoring him.

But five Sherpas employed to assist Mr Ogwyn's climb up the mountain were killed in an avalanche on the mountain on Friday. At least 13 people lost their lives and many more were injured in the deadliest accident to have ever happened on Mount Everest.

At least thirteen men were killed in single deadliest accident in the history of the world's highest mountain. They were laid to rest on Monday in a traditional Buddhist ceremony, pictured

Despite the tragedy, Mr Ogwyn said he planned to go ahead with the stunt - sparking outrage around the globe.

In
 response, the Discovery Channel yesterday announced the jump, which was
 scheduled to be televised live on May 11 worldwide, has been cancelled.

The announcement came as the victims of the avalanche were cremated on Monday in a traditional Buddhist ceremony.

Discovery
 Network spokeswoman Laurie Goldberg said that the network's thoughts 
and prayers go out to the Sherpa community of guides who were the 
victims of the avalanche.

Mr
 Ogwyn had wanted to go ahead with the jump to 'honour' the men who had 
lost their lives while helping take equipment for the stunt up the 
mountain. 

Writing
 on Facebook from Everest Base Camp, he said: 'Today is a brighter day. 
We are staying on the mountain to honour our friends and complete our 
project...[It] has become much bigger now.'

He said he will also set up a charity to help the families of those killed on the 8,848 metre mountain.

But his comments sparked outrage from critics who claimed he was just placing more lives at risk by proceeding.

According
 to The Times, one critic Anina Young commented on his post: 'You are 
actually going to put the safety of those around you [at risk] by still 
jumping? What, are you crazy? Don’t be a selfish ****hole. The worst 
disaster on Mount Everest and you think what you are doing is honouring 
the Sherpas?'

At
 least 13 people were killed and a further three are missing after the 
avalanche swept the Khumbu Icefall, one of the most dangerous parts of 
the climb to Everest.

Nepalese
 officials have called off the search for the missing men - saying there
 is no chance of finding them alive and their rescuers are being pout at
 risk.

At least three others are under intensive care for broken limbs, ribs, blood clots and other injuries in Kathmandu hospitals.

The
 men were trying to fix ropes and crack snow and ice to carve out a 
route for foreign climbers when they were caught in the avalanche at an 
altitude of about 5,800m, just below Camp One, at about 6.30am on Friday.

In the 
wake of the avalanche, the Sherpas have expressed anger that there has 
not been a bigger response from Nepal's government, which profits from 
the permit fees charged for the climbing expeditions.

It has resulted in several Sherpas quitting while others are debating whether to boycott the expeditions.

Meanwhile
 some guides have asked for the mountain to be closed to expeditions 
during the popular climbing season that runs through May this year as a 
mark of respect for the dead.

Guiding
 foreign climbers is the main livelihood for Sherpas, helping them make 
up to $5,000 a year in a country with an average annual income of just 
over $700.

But
 the accident has re-ignited debate on the risks Sherpas take and on 
overcrowding on Everest, where the number of fatal accidents has risen 
in the past decades as more and more commercial expeditions are 
launched.

The government has issued 334 permits this season, up from 328 last year.

When
 the Nepalese government released this list, only 12 were dead and four 
were missing. The latest reports have the number of fatalities up to 13 
but they have not disclosed who is the new fatality.
