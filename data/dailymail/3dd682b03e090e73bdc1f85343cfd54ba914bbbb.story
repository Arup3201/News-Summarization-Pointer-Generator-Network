Roy Hodgson insisted he will not quit as England manager despite admitting he was 'devastated' after his side's 2-1 defeat to Uruguay at the World Cup.

The result leaves the Three Lions bottom of Group D with zero points and needing Italy to win their two remaining matches and hope they can beat Costa Rica themselves on Tuesday.

And, after Luis Suarez scored twice for the South Americans, Hodgson said: 'I don't have any intention to resign.

'I've been really happy with the way the players have responded to the work we've tried to.

'I'm bitter disappointed, of course, but I don't feel I need to resign, no.

'On the other hand, if the FA think I'm not the right man to do the job...

'We believed we could do enough to get a result in this game. Having worked so hard to get back to 1-1 I believed we would go on to win the game or at least draw, so to concede the second goal is an unbelievable blow. I don't really know what to say at this time.

'We are more then disappointed, we're devastated.

'It was a goal we don't expect to concede. Long goal kicks with the type of players we have in the team, we deal with them.

'I thought we would go on possibly to win the game and certainly I didn't think we would lose the game at that point.

'We had been in control for such a long time. After the first five minutes (of the second half) we got back on track. We've been near their goal so many times, but it doesn't matter how many times you get near the other team's goal, it matters how many times you put it in the back of the net and we haven't done that enough.'

On Suarez, he said: 'He scored the two 
goals. The first goal in particular was exceptionally good, Cavani's 
chip and his pulling away to the back post and the cleverness of his 
header I thought was really top, top play. The second one I thought he 
was a bit fortunate, but when he got himself through he made no 
mistake.'
