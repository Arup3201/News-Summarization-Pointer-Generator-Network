A mother who still breastfeeds her five-year-old daughter has likened stopping the habit to robbing a child of their favourite toy.

Sharon Spink, 44, from Sherburn in Elmet, North Yorkshire, has said that she continues to feed her daughter Charlotte because she wants 'mummy milk'.

She said: 'It’s like taking away her favourite teddy, would you do that to a child? Would you take her favourite toy?'

Mother Sharon Spink said that she will continue feeding her five-year-old until her daughter tells her she no longer wants 'mummy milk'

Mrs Spink sparked controversy earlier this week during an exclusive interview with The Sun when she revealed that she continued to feed her five-year-old.

The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding as a sole form of feeding until six months and combined with other food until the age of two.

Today, Mrs Spink told viewers of ITV's This Morning that the choice to feed was down to her daughter and that she would only stop once she is ready. She said: 'It's her choice. It's her choice to feed and it's her choice to stop.'

Mrs Spink said her breasts would continue producing milk because the liquid is created on a 'supply and demand' principle.

She added that her daughter would not be able to continue feeding aged 11 or 12 because her mouth would become too large.

When presenter Eammon Holmes asked the mother-of four: 'Is the demand there?' she said that Charlotte asked her for 'mummy milk'.

Mrs Spink admitted that she sometimes would like to stop breastfeeding because she is occasionally left with painful teeth marks.

Mrs Spink has divided public opinion on social media after appearing on This Morning to discuss why she still breastfeeds her five-year-old daughter

Mrs Spink said that she rarely received criticism for the habit and was often praised for her decision. She said that she would stop feeding when her daughter no longer wanted the milk

Mrs Spink said: 'I don't have any choice in it really'. She added that she would stop if her daughter no longer wanted to feed.

At the moment both Charlotte and her mother are 'happy' with the arrangement and Mrs Spink believes that breastfeeding should be down to personal choice.

She said her daughter sees the process as a form of comfort and likes having milk before going to bed.

Mrs Spink hit back at critics again saying that she believed many other parents breastfeed their older children - but  that the habit is kept behind closed doors.

When Eammon Holmes asked the mother-of four: 'Is the demand there?' she said that Charlotte asked her for 'mummy milk'.

She said that there were 'plenty' of older children still having breast milk.

But Mrs Spink claimed that she rarely receives criticism for feeding her daughter and is generally praised for her decision.

Charlotte's classmates sometimes ask what their friend is doing but when Mrs Spink explains the process to them they generally walk off and say 'ok then', the mother said.

In television series Little Britain, David Walliams plays Harvey Pincher, who continues to ask for his mother's 'bitty' so that he can have breastmilk - despite being in his twenties.

Ahead of Mrs Spink's appearance on today's programme Little Britain actor David Walliams posted a picture of The Sun's article with only the word 'bitty...'

Mrs Spink send a scathing reply to the actor in which she wrote: 'Thanks so much for doing breastfeeding mums such a disservice. You really need to educate yourself.'

This afternoon, Mrs Spink continued to defend her decision. Speaking to Julie Hartley-Brewer she told radio station LBC: 'We know there are benefits to breastfeeding those benefits don't go away just because the child has got to five.

'It's like saying broccoli suddenly loses all its nutritional value because you're now thirty years old.'

She said that feeding was predominantly a comfort mechanism for Charlotte.

She said that the milk acted as a 'natural anesthetic' so her daughter often wanted the milk when she was hurt or upset. Charlotte was once at a party and fell over so Mrs Spink fed her to comfort her.

But Mrs Spink has continued to receive mixed messages on social media both criticising and praising the mother-of-four.

One parenting blogger wrote: 'It's a disgrace a culture that promotes milk from a cow over a human, such ignorance.' In a second tweet she added: 'I fully support women breastfeeding their child until the child chooses.'

But other tweeters blasted Mrs Spink describing the decision as 'disgusting' and 'ridiculous'. Many expressed concerns about the possibility of Charlotte becoming a victim of bullying.

Around 78 per cent of women in England breast feed, research shows.

According to the World Health Organisation, women are recommended to breastfeed their new-born babies for around six months. 

The NHS Start 4 Life site highlights, however, that breast milk is the most natural food for a child - and so on most occasions, the longer child receives it the better.

Breastfeeding can provide numerous health benefits to both mother and child. It can help a baby fight against infections and can also protect babies against becoming overweight. There is also evidence to suggest the process helps new mothers avoid putting on weight also.

A lot of mothers prefer breast feeding as it is available whenever and wherever a baby needs. It is always the right temperature, also.

The process of breastfeeding can also build a strong physical and emotional bond between mother and baby.

Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting website Netmums supported Mrs Spink in her actions.

She said: 'In the UK breastfeeding beyond a year or two is seen as strange, but it's normal in many other cultures and countries.

'While some children will wean themselves off by a year, others like the comfort and closeness breastfeeding brings.

'While it is undoubtedly unusual to still be feeding a school age child, if the parent and child are happy then that is their decision. It's down to the individual family and what works for them.'

Lactation consultant Catherine Cooper is a member of the Lactation Consultants of Great Britain association.

She said that she believes the decision should be down to each mother and that no one should be judged for the choice that they make.

She said that breastfeeding boosted a child's immune system but the process was 'far more than just nutrition'.

She added: 'Breastfeeding is also about the closeness, there is emotional re-booting, breastfeeding is really just like a cuddle.'
