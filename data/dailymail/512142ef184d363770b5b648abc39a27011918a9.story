With its ample dining space, kitchen, laundry room and four bedrooms, it would make the perfect family home.

A perfect family home for tiny inanimate objects, that is.

This beautiful Victorian doll's house made by a couple for their six-year-old daughter more than 150 years ago is set to be auctioned next week for £10,000.

A husband and wife known only as Mr and Mrs Newton, from Liverpool, worked together in 1850 to create the house and its furnishings for their daughter, Emma.

The dolls, china, utensils and some of the more elaborate furniture were produced in Switzerland and Germany at that time and were added to the doll's house during the family's holidays abroad

Mr Newton, a lawyer and amateur carpenter, created the house while his wife made the bedclothes.

The dolls, china, utensils and some of the more elaborate furniture were produced in Switzerland and Germany at that time and were added to the doll's house during the family's holidays abroad.

The house and its furnishings, which are all to scale, has been played with by children for the past 100 years as the historic toy has been passed on through the generations of the Newton family.

The doll's house moved to Askham Richard, Yorkshire, when Emma Newton married the Rev. Usher Miles and was much loved and played with by their five daughters.

On the death of her husband in 1912, Mrs Miles moved to Cheltenham where the doll's house remained until her death in 1931, when a home was found for it with her second son, Dr William Miles at Bewdley, Worcestershire.

A spokesperson for Chorley's said: 'Almost all the toy collection is in original condition and was collected to create a toy museum, which unfortunately never happened'

The owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, has had the collector's piece since the 1970s

When he in turn died in 1953, the doll's house came to Gloucester and was in the possession of his eldest daughter, Pauline Taylor until 1972, when it passed to the present owner.

The toy is to be put up for auction by Chorley's near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on November 28.

The doll's house has an entrance hall with a kitchen and laundry room on the ground floor.

The first floor boasts two 
exceptionally well-furnished reception rooms with two equally well 
laid-out bedrooms on the second floor.

Even the attic rooms are furnished in a style that would have been acceptable in the 1850s.

The owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, has had the collector's piece since the 1970s.

A spokesperson for Chorley's said: ‘Almost all the toy collection is in original condition and was collected to create a toy museum, which unfortunately never happened.

‘But the boxes of children's playthings, housed by this collector for over half a century, would have been played with by children over the previous 100 years.’
