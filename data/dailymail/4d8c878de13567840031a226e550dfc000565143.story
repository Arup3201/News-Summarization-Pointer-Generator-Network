There’s an awful lot to see and do in New York – but I’m staying in The James hotel and it’s sapping my motivation to go out and explore. It’s a Disney Land of swankery that’s hard to walk away from.

First of all, there’s my room. It’s on a corner, 11 floors up, overlooking the streets of Manhattan’s trendy Soho district – and it’s mesmerising.

Two sides of the room are almost entirely formed of windows and when I arrive I spend a good while peering out of them at the district’s jumble of offices, townhouses and designer shops.

Glass act: The corner bedroom suites at The James offer great views of Manhattan

Luxury: Pay a bit more and you can have a room with a magnificent stand-alone bath

Trendy: The James' Jimmy bar is a magnet for Manhattan's trenderatti

Slightly frustratingly I can’t see any famous landmarks, but it’s still an enticing Big Apple panorama.

I’m meeting two friends for a drink later so figure a quick shower is in order, but the shower nearly derails my timekeeping.

It’s a rain shower that’s all the rage in quality hotels, but this one is like standing under a monsoon. It’s magnificent and I’m half-tempted to spend all evening amid the soothing cascade.

The bathroom is very clean, modern – smothered in easy-on-the-eye tiles - and stocked with very generous quantities of organic shampoo, conditioner and body wash by Intelligent Nutrients. While crucially for bleary-eyed nighttime visits, it has a dimmer switch for the lights.

Take the plunge: There are great views from the rooftop pool, with the Freedom Tower visible to the south. Picture courtesy of an HTC One

Smiles better: Ted on the rooftop with the skyline in the background, pictured relaxing in one of the hotel's bathrobes

It’s separated from the room by a glass wall, a style the hotel calls ‘peek-a-boo’. I call it baffling.

I just can’t fathom why anyone would want to be visible to their roommate – and the outside world – while sitting on the loo or wielding a loofer (not supplied) in the shower.

Fortunately The James has anticipated some of its guests harbouring conservative sensibilities. Total privacy is assured by way of a screen that winds down efficiently at a touch of a button inside the bathroom.

The exposure theme doesn’t end there, because a bare concrete pillar is another distinctive feature of the room.

I’m not often wooed by industrial aesthetics but in this room it works – somehow giving the space a bit of extra artiness. Of course, it helps that a huge flat-screen TV is attached to it.

The room – the hotel calls it ‘a corner studio’ – comes with one enormous kingside bed. I’m staying with my dear mother, so to accommodate us one of the in-room service attendants brings up a camp bed.

It looks so incongruous in our otherwise chic surroundings that I half expect to have to sign a disclaimer promising that I won’t reveal that the hotel uses them.

Urban garden: The outdoor dining arrangement at The James is just superb

Enticing: The James 'urban garden' has several levels and walkways

A brand new feather-filled duvet for it is unwrapped in front of us - it’s a camp bed, but a Rolls-Royce of camp beds.

I’m meeting my chums at the top floor bar – called ‘Jimmy’ – which is blessed with the wow factor.

Several wow factors, actually. There’s the view uptown – towards the Empire State building. The view downtown - and the Freedom Tower.

And the plunge pool. 

Standing on the decking with a glass of highly quaffable chenin blanc gazing at the sun setting over the New York skyline is truly staggering.

The bar, meanwhile, is staffed by two very able cocktail conjurers, dispensing liquor to what looks to be Soho’s trenderatti, scattered hither and thither on upholstered cubes.

It’s a bar that attracts the well-heeled – and actual big heels.

I revisit the pool for an early morning dip the following day – and it’s just as magical without the aid of a wine haze. The pool is really only big enough for a handful of people, though, so pick your moments for a swim.

The James’ in-house eating options are as magnetic as its rooftop delights. The restaurant – The David Burke Kitchen - is named after the celebrity chef that bears ultimate responsibility for the standard of fodder.

The hotel is clearly proud of the collaboration, with the restaurant given lashings of hype on its website.

The confidence certainly isn’t misplaced. The excellent cooking is on the rustic side, with a bit of artistry and flair thrown in for good measure.

Starters include Peanut Butter maple bacon dates, chicken dumplings and cornbread crusted oysters.

Diners can choose from such delights as heritage pork, salt brick beef and red snapper for mains.

High life: The James rises up 29 floors above Manhattan's trendy Soho district

Corking: The impressive hotel lobby, where free wine and cheese is served between 6 and 8pm

Flair: The David Burke Kitchen's coconut trifle

I plump for a delicious and refreshing tomato and watermelon gazpacho for my starter with chicken and English peas for my main course. Cooked to perfection.

For dessert I opt for a sumptuous coconut trifle served in a jam jar. Inventive and cute.

The wine list is nothing short of sensational, with a frankly astonishing range of grape-based liquor on offer.

The cellar harbours everything from the highly drinkable and affordable to legendary reds such as Chateau Petrus and what some might regard as  one of the finest white wines in the world – Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru.

You’ll need deep pockets, for these, though.

What makes eating at The James extra special are the seating options. It’s a gourmand’s playground. You can dine indoors in a stylish loft-type space, or outside, as we did, in a sort of urban garden.

It has multiple levels with walkways and steps leading to variously sized dining areas all surrounded by lush foliage. There’s a bar in there somewhere, too. It’s quite brilliant. Note - map and compass recommended.

Extricate yourself from The James’ and you’ll find the surrounding area has plenty going for it. Soho is in that bit of New York without skyscapers in between the bits with skyscrapers (Downtown and Midtown).

Designer shops such as Dior and Luis Vuitton nestle in nearby streets, along with culinary hotspots such as Balthazar and Lupa. Washington Square - where a myriad of New York characters gather to relax by the fountain, play chess and eat ice cream - is also just a few minutes away on foot.

Arty: A wall made up entirely of computer keys in the entrance to the hotel

Five reasons to stay at the James New York:

We spend 30 minutes there listening to a busker playing an actual grand piano that he’d wheeled into the park. Astonishing.

No city tires you out quite like the frenetic Big Apple. Fortunately, my bed is more than equal to the task of leaving me rested and refreshed, ready for more urban adventures. It’s supremely comfortable with luxuriously soft pillows.

Fuelling up with breakfast at The David Burke Kitchen turns out to be an experience almost as gourmet in nature as dinner.

Just-right eggs benedict is served up with lashings of smooth coffee and a quirky grapefruit brulee – think crème brulee, but with the caramel covering halves of grapefruit – that proves a winner with Mother Thornhill.

The hotel does all the basics really well – clean comfortable rooms, great food, first-class bathroom experiences, superb location and, in case you were wondering, very courteous staff.

Crucially, there’s also free – and very fast – Wi-Fi.

There are flourishes here, though, that propel The James from being a good hotel to a great hotel.

The intriguing urban garden dining experience I’ve already mentioned, but there are also pleasing touches such as free – highly quaffable – wine with cheese and biscuits served in the lobby every evening, bowls of food and water laid out by the entrance for guests’ dogs and modern art peppered along the corridors.

I particularly like the wall by the entrance covered with computer keys.

It’s no wonder that The James brand - there are also hotels in Chicago and Miami - attracts celebrities such as Sofia Vergara, Zoe Saldana and Channing Tatum.

Yes, it's got glass-walled bathrooms, but my love for this place is utterly transparent.
