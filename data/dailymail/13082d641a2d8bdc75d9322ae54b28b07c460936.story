Historians seeking to identify a troop of fallen World War One soldiers could be one step closer to cracking the 99 year mystery after tracing the descendant of a young man killed in France in 1914.

The group of unknown soldiers, who fell during heavy gunfire during a battle in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, could be identified thanks to DNA provided by the great-nephew of Private Frederick Thompson, who was reported missing in action at the age of 20.

It is believed Private Frederick could be one of the 15 found at the site in France in 2009.

Now, his great-nephew Eric Saunders, 61,
from Worcester, has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it matches with 
one of the sets of remains and proves it belongs to his relative.

And historians from the Commonwealth War Grave Commission hope that after the DNA testing has been undertaken, they will finally be able to discover their identities and give them a military funeral 100 years on.

The remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009.

Archaeologists uncovered partial skeletal remains of 15 men - alongside toothbrushes, and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment - after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009.

One young soldier, Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War may be identified nearly a century after his death, from DNA provided by his great-nephew, in one of the first DNA tests on the soldier's remains.

The commission managed to track down Private Thompson’s closest living relative, his great nephew Mr Saunders, and they are now awaiting the results of his DNA test to see if Private Thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified.

Mr Saunders said: 'I had no idea that any of my relatives served in the Great War. I feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country.

'I was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20.

'I have grandchildren that age myself, and I can’t even begin to imagine what those soldier’s poor mothers went through.

'I know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives.

'I didn’t really know anything about my mother’s side of the family. We were both shocked.

The number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year, but since 2003 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year.

Over the last decade the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found, while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011.

Each case can involve multiple sets of remains - bomber crews for example commonly involve seven casualties - but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time.

The most common cause of discoveries are building work or farmers ploughing fields. The vast majority of cases are in France and Belgium

In all instances, the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority - the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving.

The commission’s responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial. The commission then identifies the appropriate cemetery - usually the closest Commonwealth War Cemetery in which there is space - manufacture the headstone, prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place. 

'I was very keen to give a DNA sample to try and prove the identity of these unknown heroes.

'I’ve
been told it may take several months to come back with a result, but I 
hope I can do my bit to give those men the proper funeral they deserve.

'I’ve said that I would like to attend the funeral ceremony for the men, even if it turns out not to be my uncle’s remains. I feel as though I have a bond with those men now.'

The 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment had been based in Ireland at the outbreak of the war, landing in France on September 9, 1914, and taking part in the Battle of Armentihres.

The battalion then headed to fight with the 6th Division along a line from Preniesques to Radinghem in an action that lasted from October 20 to 31.

All the men will be laid to rest in the same graveyard with full military honours, to mark the centenary of their deaths in October 2014.

An MOD spokesman said: 'The use of DNA can in some cases enable us to confirm the identity of remains that are discovered, but after many decades results may be inconclusive. We always take steps to make families fully aware of this possibility.

'DNA testing is only used where there is a realistic chance of a positive match being obtained and may not be appropriate in all cases.

'The JCCC Historic Casework team undertakes a unique and essential role in investigating where remains of British Service Personnel are found on wartime battlefields and is always mindful that their work often closes a chapter for families who have lost loved ones many years ago.'
