Scientists have created cyborg sperm that they can control using a simple fridge magnet.

Dubbed ‘MagnetoSperm’, the bots have a metal-coated head and a bendable body that is around six times longer than human sperm.

Researchers hope their tiny mechanical creations can be used to put together nanoscale products, aid drug delivery and even help improve egg fertilisation.

Like bacteria, sperm use a whip-like ‘flagellum’ to move themselves through liquid.

Using a weak magnetic field, scientists from the Netherlands and Egypt have made the robot ‘swim' forward and steered it towards a fixed point.

The cyborg sperm is made from a strong plastic with a metal coating wrapped around its head using a technique called electron beam evaporation.

When force is produced from a moving electromagnetic field, the metal element is pushed in different directions.

In December, the first ever biological robots that are powered by sperm were created by scientists in Germany.

Researchers managed to trap single sperm cells inside metal nanotubes and remotely control their direction using magnets

Like MagnetoSperm, these biobots could be used in humans to deliver drugs to a very specific parts of the body or to help fertilise an egg.

Oliver Schmidt at the Institute for Integrative Nanosciences in Dresden created magnetic nanotubes that were 50 microns long by 5 to 8 microns in diameter and dropped these into a fluid containing bull sperm.

To trap the sperm and stop them from escaping, the tubes were narrower at one end and could be moved using a magnetic field, Professor Schmidt told MailOnline. 

‘A sperm-driven micro-bio robot could be used for magnetically guided transport and delivery purposes in biomedical applications,’ said Professor Schmidt.

 ‘Of course, the vision of using magnetically guided human sperms for assisted fertilisation seems most compelling but is still far from being realised.'

The researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands and German University in Cairo were able to steer the robot by directing the magnetic field lines.

The MagnetoSperm can move along at up to 0.5 body lengths per second, while a human sperm can cover several times its body length in that time.

‘Nature has designed efficient tools for locomotion at micro-scales,’ said Dr Sarthak Misra, an associate professor at the University of Twente.

‘Our microrobots are either inspired from nature or directly use living micro-organisms such as magnetotactic bacteria and sperm cells for complex micro-manipulation and targeted therapy tasks.’

‘As technology progresses and many products get smaller, it becomes difficult to assemble objects on nano- and micro-scales,’ added Dr Islam Khalil, an assistant professor of the German University in Cairo.

‘MagnetoSperm can be used to manipulate and assemble objects at these scales using an external source of magnetic field to control its motion.’

This isn’t the first time scientists have attempted to create robosperm. In December, the first ever biological robots that are powered by sperm were created by scientists in Germany. 

Dubbed ‘MagnetoSperm’, the bots have a metal-coated head and a bendable body that is around six times longer than human sperm at 322 microns-long

To trap the sperm and stop them from escaping, the tubes were narrower at one end and could be moved using a magnetic field, Professor Schmidt told MailOnline.

‘The biggest challenge was to adjust the size of the micro tube to a diameter slightly larger than the sperm head by at the same time maintaining the mobility of the sperm tails,’ he said.

The tail-like part of the sperm cell pokes outside the end of the tube to power the biobot like a propeller.

‘A sperm-driven micro-bio robot could be used for magnetically guided transport and delivery purposes in biomedical applications,’ said Professor Schmidt.
