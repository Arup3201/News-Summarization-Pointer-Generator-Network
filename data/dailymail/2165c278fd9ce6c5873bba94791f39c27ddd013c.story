Daisy the baby giraffe has not had the easiest start in life.

The ‘leggy brunette’ was abandoned by her mother, and so has to be fed through a tube which is being kept in place by a bandage around her long neck.

Orphan Daisy was born an unusually large baby giraffe, so her mother did not see her as a calf and therefore stopped producing milk when she was born.

Staff at Southwick Zoo, Massachusetts, now help feed and care for her, which includes a special coat which she wears to keep her warm.

Daisy also has to be kept separate from her playmates, in order to stop the other giraffes accidentally injuring her delicate frame.

At six-foot-high and weighing 140lbs, Daisy was extraordinarily large for a female calf.

Her unusually tall body meant she was unable to nurse straight away, which led to her mother, Dotty, abandoning her.

Without the valuable nutrients from her mother’s milk, Daisy's white blood cell count became dangerously low and she contracted an infection.

This led to the staff at the School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in Grafton, Massachusetts to place a bandage on Daisy's neck so she could be fed intravenously.

Visitors will be able to catch a glimpse of Daisy when the zoo opens again on 12 April 2014.
