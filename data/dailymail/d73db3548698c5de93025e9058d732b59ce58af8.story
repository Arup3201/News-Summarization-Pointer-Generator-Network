Kazakhstan's brutal regime has gloated that David Cameron and Tony Blair have put their bloodsoaked country on the map yesterday.

The foreign minister of the former Soviet dictatorship, best known as the home of comic creation Borat, said the country was ‘very honoured and privileged’ that two prime ministers have sought to bring the country in from the cold.

Mr Cameron yesterday became the first serving prime minister to visit Kazakhstan and its ageing autocrat Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is accused of sanctioning the torture of his political opponents.

But he dismissed concerns about human rights, saying that it was more important to drum up business deals.

Mr Cameron is set to win business worth around £700m on the trip with another £85 billion in the pipeline in the years to come.

He said he would raise the issue of human rights with President Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country with an iron fist since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

But he made clear he thinks it is more important for Britain to cash in on oil deals with one of the world’s fastest growing economies.

‘I always raise all these issues with all the partners that we have around the world.

But let’s be clear, why am I in Khazakstan on a Sunday? We are in a global race. This is one of the next emerging countries of the world.

‘I’ve over 30 British companies with me. We hope to conclude £700million worth of deals, that will mean jobs back at home. That’s what this is about.’ He and President Nazarbayev also discussed plans for Britain to evacuate military kit from Afghanistan using Kazakh air bases and trains.

In a sign of Mr Cameron’s closeness to the Kazakh regime, the Prime Minister last night flew from the oil port city of Atyrau to the capital Astana in Mr Nazarbayev’s personal private jet, while his aides followed in a charter plane.

Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov made clear that Tony Blair helped pave the way for the visit.

Mr Blair’s consultancy has secured a £16 million two year deal to advise the government of Kazakhstan on political reform - a move which critics say has led to a ‘whitewash’ of the country’s human rights record.

Mr Idrissov said: ‘We are very honoured and privileged to have such attention on the part of two prime ministers [towards] kazakhstan - Tony Blair and David Cameron. We cherish and enjoy the support of developed countries on our part for development.’

He added: ‘We are grateful that Mr Tony Blair and his colleagues are providing invaluable advice.’ Mr Cameron last night faced warnings that his visit would boost the standing of the dictatorial regime which gunned down 15 unarmed protestors during a strike by oil workers in December 2011.

Algerim Dzhakisheva, whose father 
Muktur was seized by secret police and imprisoned on trumped up charges,
 said: ‘The government of Kazakhstan is carrying out a massive PR 
offensive around the world and looking to be seen as a credible, 
constructive player on the world stage.

‘But
 that shouldn’t blind people to its massive abuses of the human rights 
of its own citizens.’ Mr Cameron also risked a diplomatic row last night
 by admitting that he has watched the Borat movie, in which comedian 
Sacha Baron Cohen depicted the nation as a group of idiots and rapists 
who throw Jews down wells.

'As
 for the film, I did see it, it was a long time ago. I think I will rest
 on the words of the foreign minister who I gather pointed out that his 
country had survived Stalin and could probably survive anything else.’

Mr Idrissov admitted that Kazakhstan has faced criticisms and made the 
adventurous claim that it is on the path to democracy despite the most 
recent rigged election giving Mr Nazarbayev 95 per cent of the vote.

He said: ‘We do not claim that we have got everything right or that there are no problems to overcome.

‘It
 was never going to be possible to turn a country with no democratic 
institutions or culture into a Jeffersonian democracy in two decades. 
What is important is the direction of travel. Kazakhstan remains 
committed to a democratic path.’

A
 spokeswoman for Tony Blair insisted the former prime minister does not 
personally profit from his dealings with the Nazarbayev regime.

She said: ‘Kazakhstan is an important country in an important region at an important time for the world.

‘David Cameron is absolutely right to be seeking to forge closer economic and political ties for these reasons and because of Kazakhstan’s strategic positioning in the world and the supportive role it is playing with regard to troops returning from Afghanistan.’

Earlier in the day, Mr Cameron became the first Western leader to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif since his recent election. He urged the Pakistanis to press the Taliban to engage in peace talks.

On Saturday he visited troops in Afghanistan to mark Armed Forces Day.
