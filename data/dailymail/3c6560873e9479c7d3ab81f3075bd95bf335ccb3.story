This is the inspirational video that gives a new spin on the term 'happy campers'.

Deaf campers and staff from the 2014 Film Camp  at Camp Mark Seven, New York, performed Pharrell's hit song 'Happy' in American Sign Language (ASL).

The music video was part of a project where deaf instructors taught campers to integrate ASL translation into a song and learn the art of dance choreography.

All 24 students at the  film camp helped to make the video, either starring in it or working behind the scenes.

And their hard work paid off as the YouTube video now has more than 520,000 views. 

The expression of music was composed by deaf performance artist Rosa Lee Timm and Azora Telford.

There are even cameos from British deaf filmmaker Bim Ajadi and South African animator and campaigner Braam Jordaan.

The camp offers film-making education for deaf and hard-of-hearing youths between the ages of eight and 16.

Happy features on Williams’ second solo album, Girl, as well as in last year’s Despicable Me 2. 

With worldwide sales of more than 10 million copies, the song has become one of the best-selling singles of all time.
