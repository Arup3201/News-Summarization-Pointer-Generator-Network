Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander claims 3.3million jobs are linked to Britain's membership of the European Union

Three million British jobs will be put in peril if the UK quits the European Union, an official Treasury study suggests.

As David Cameron hints he could back an exit if Brussels rebuffs his calls for reform, Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander will use a speech today to highlight the ‘risk that isolationists would have us take’.

He will tell an audience in Washington that government experts have calculated that 3.3 million jobs are ‘connected’ to Britain’s EU membership, and the rise of UKIP does not mean Britain is ‘on the brink of exiting the EU’.

Europe remains the biggest source of tension between the Tories and Lib Dems in the coalition.

Mr Alexander will defy the Conservatives to release new analysis on the number of jobs linked to the EU.

It is understood he asked civil servants in the Treasury to calculate the link between EU membership and employment two months ago, but was warned by George Osborne’s aides against making it public.

Senior Tories are thought to be concerned the data contradicts claims from Eurosceptics in the party that Britain could thrive and prosper if it goes it alone.

Mr Cameron has promised that if he wins the next election, he will seek to claw back powers form Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.

Britain has grown increasingly isolated in recent days, as Mr Cameron emerged as the lone voice in opposition to Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker becoming President of the European Commission.

The Prime Minister will push the issue to a vote at a summit in Brussels on Friday, despite almost all other 27 EU leaders being in agreement that Mr Juncker should get the job.

With relations souring, Downing Street has hinted that Mr Cameron the Prime Minister campaigning to leave the EU if he does not get the reforms he wants from Brussels in the coming years.

But Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will dismiss the idea that the Britain is inching closer to withdrawing from the EU.

‘When the focus is on jobs, and growth, and wider risks we take with our prosperity through isolation then the argument can and will be won. Indeed, the latest Treasury analysis shows that 3.3 million British jobs are connected to Britain's place in Europe.

‘That is the measure of the risk that isolationists would have us take.

‘British people want the jobs and opportunities that come with staying in the EU.

‘They want Britain to continue leading in Europe and they want Britain to remain a leading voice on the world stage.’

Mr Alexander will argue that polls show support for remaining in Europe has risen in recent months, with an eight point lead for those who want to remain in.

‘Despite seemingly increasing euro-scepticism in the UK, we are not on the brink of exiting the EU,’ Mr Alexander will say.

‘Doing so would be a disaster for Britain, putting our hard-fought economic recovery at risk.

‘And I don’t believe the British public would vote to pull out of the EU in the event a referendum is called.’

Mr Alexander will use the speech in the US capital to urge Americans to ‘to stay engaged, speak out and help keep Britain in the EU’.

Three weeks ago US President Barack Obama warned it is ‘hard for me to imagine that project (EU) going well in the absence of Britain’.

He added: ‘I think it is also hard for me to image it would be advantageous for Great Britain to be excluded from political decisions that have an enormous impact on its economic and political life.’

Mr Alexander will point to President Obama’s remarks, adding: ‘We want to remain in …because Britain stands tall in the world – and dare I say in Washington – when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.’

Britain's influence in Europe has been damaged by David Cameron's posturing over who will get the top jobs in Brussels, Vince Cable claimed today.

The Business Secretary claimed Mr Cameron's robust opposition to Jean-Claude Juncker becoming president of the European Commission 'has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe'. 

Mr Cameron has vowed to fight 'until the end' the appointment of a man seen by the UK as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform.

Half of voters think David Cameron will be seen as 'strong' for opposing Jean-Claude Juncker's appointment, even if he loses.

A Populus poll for the Financial Times found just 22 people of people think the Prime Minister will be seen as weak if, as expected, Mr Juncker is named the new President of the European Commission.

Just 13 per cent of people think Mr Cameron is wrong to try and block the appointment.

The public remains split on Britain's membership of the EU. 

The survey found 37 per cent would vote to stay in the EU, while 36 per cent would vote to leave in a referendum. 

Labour and the Lib Dems have publicly supported the Tories in insisting Mr Juncker is the wrong man for the job. 

But on the eve of a summit where Mr Cameron is expected to find himself isolated on the appointment by fellow EU leaders, Mr Cable also criticised his approach.

'It hasn't been good for David Cameron,' Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today.

'I think he is right in principle that the appointment of the commission president shouldn't be foisted on heads of government.

'I think he was right to take the position he did but the way it's been done, unfortunately, has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe.'

Mr Juncker said he was confident of securing the post by the end of this week, 'if common sense prevails'.

In an apparent dig at the Prime Minister's campaign against him, the former Luxembourg premier said he was being forced to wait for a decision because common sense was 'very unequally distributed'.

Mr Cameron believes that the selection of a candidate chosen by the largest party grouping in the European Parliament would breach the principle that candidates for top jobs are nominated by national leaders and not by MEPs.

Having apparently failed to recruit enough fellow leaders to form a blocking minority at this week's European Council summit, speculation is mounting that he might be prepared to deploy an arcane EU procedure nicknamed the 'L-bomb' to stop Juncker's candidacy.

The 'Luxembourg compromise' - created in 1965 to assuage the anger of Charles de Gaulle at France being outvoted by smaller countries - allows an EU member to delay a decision which affects an important national interest until a unanimously acceptable solution can be found.
