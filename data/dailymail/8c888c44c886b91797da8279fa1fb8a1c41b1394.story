Luke Shaw is in hysterics, patting the knee of his Southampton and England team-mate Rickie Lambert when the talk turns to beetroot.

‘It’s crazy. I didn’t even realise until recently he worked at a beetroot factory,’ said Shaw. ‘It shows how far he has come; I am so proud of what he has achieved.’

Everything is new to Shaw, the 18-year-old left back who has been catapulted into a World Cup. It seems crazy to think that his first World Cup memory is from 2006 when England were beaten by Portugal in the quarter-finals. Scary stuff.

To travel 
to Brazil ahead of Ashley Cole, the former Chelsea left back who played 
107 times for his country, is something quite extraordinary.

Back
 in March, when he made his England debut against Denmark as a  
second-half substitute for Ashley Cole, he was still living in digs in 
Southampton. He doesn’t even drive.

‘I
 was in digs for three or four years and they were like a second family 
to me but I recently moved out and am going to get my own flat,’ he 
added.

‘When I got my first England call, I was still in digs in the same place as one of the Under 18s.

‘It
 is something I did for three or four years and I loved it. I didn’t 
feel I needed to move out soon because it was like another home for me.

‘I
 don’t drive but one of the young lads drives to training, Tom Leggett 
(who has just joined Aston Villa). After the World Cup I am going to do 
that intensive course to learn to drive in one week.’

This
 has been an incredible journey, and Shaw was still taking it all in as 
he sat alongside his Southampton team-mate Lambert this week.

Making way: Shaw is going to the World Cup in front of Ashley Cole

He
 only realised he’d make the squad when Cole confirmed his international
 retirement on Twitter on the final day of the Barclays Premier League 
season on May 11.

‘My
 family were crying,’ he explained. ‘But it was the best feeling in the 
world. I didn’t think I was 100 per cent going. I waited until the next 
day to see the squad announced.

‘It
 was something I had dreamed of, to represent my country at a World Cup.
 A few years ago I was sat watching Ashley Cole (for England) on TV; I 
wouldn’t say I have taken his place but I have gone to the World Cup in 
front of him.

‘When
 I look back, it is unbelievable how far I have come. I have had two 
years playing in the Premier League, now I am going to represent my 
country at the World Cup.

At times he nervously bites on his nails or chomps on some chewing gum as he spoke about his rapid progress at Southampton.

His move to Manchester United is on hold, but he knows there are some big decisions to make when he returns from the World Cup.

‘That doesn’t bother me one bit, I am here to play for England and that is all I am focusing on.’

During
 England’s open training session this week, he was one of three players 
(with Raheem  Sterling and Ross Barkley) pulled to one side by head 
coach Roy Hodgson as they walked off the pitch.

‘He
 just talked about the season, he has been to a lot of Southampton 
games. It was a very tough decision between me and Ashley but it was 
about form and the best players  at this point. He said I’ve had a  
fantastic season; that is why I am here.’

It
 seems incredible to think he was released by Chelsea when he was eight,
 the team he supported as a boy after being brought up close to their 
Cobham training ground in West Molesey.

‘I was let go because of my height,’ he added. ‘I think it was only when I was about 14 or 15 I got bigger.

‘I
 can’t remember much about being released but after my first day on 
trial at Southampton, I got a phone call straight away to tell me they 
wanted to take me on.’

He has graduated through Southampton’s academy, rising through the development teams to become the first-choice left back.

This
 week Southampton fired Under 18 coaches Jason Dodd and Paul Williams, 
part of executive director Les Reed’s battle for more control. Shaw is 
fiercely protective.

‘I
 sent them a text straight away to thank them for everything,’ he added.
 ‘They meant a lot to me and helped me a lot with my development. I was 
with them from 15 to 17. They helped me massively; when I saw the news I
 was very upset.’

The
 talent factory at St Mary’s includes Shaw, James Ward-Prowse, Calum 
Chambers, Sam Gallagher and Harry Reed, all first-team  professionals at
 Saints.

‘I
 don’t know if it is any different to other clubs but the way we get 
brought up is very good,’ he added. ‘We are all meant to be grounded. At
 other clubs there might be players who receive a professional contract 
and think they have made it.

‘If
 someone goes over the limit and starts acting big time, I’m sure they 
will be brought down a peg. They’ll be straight in a room with the boss 
and have a meeting to say this is not the Southampton way.’
