A girl who was involved in a hit and run which left her with a brain injury remained in a coma 16 months later.

Shea Olivia Shaw, then 15, was walking home from a party with her boyfriend on January 8 last year when she was hit by the driver of an SUV who didn't slow down. No arrests have been made and the person behind the wheel has never come forward.

Miss Shaw, who turned 17 this weekend, suffered a traumatic brain injury after she was hit at an intersection in San Jose, California.

Fighting: Shea Olivia Shaw turned 17 on Sunday. She remains in a coma after being hit by an SUV in San Jose, California last January - the driver has never come forward

The collision was captured on grainy CCTV footage at a gas station. It shows Shea walking home around 1am and being hit by a large vehicle - which doesn't stop.

Witnesses who ran to help the teenage girl shortly after the accident were not clearly able to identify the car or driver.

The hit and run also left Shea with a broken pelvis, leg and backbone and a perforated bladder.

At the time, Shea's boyfriend, Garrett Maxwell Burger, 18, was charged with public intoxication and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, authorities said.

Spirited: Miss Shaw was a popular cheerleader at Los Gatos High School before the accident which left her with a serious brain injury

The girl's hospital bills in the 
months after the accident ran to $1.3million and Miss Shaw's family have
turned to fundraising to bolster the mounting costs of the care she 
needs. 

A birthday party was held in Shea's honor at the 
San Jose Woman's Club mansion yesterday. Supporters listened to bands, 
took part in a silent auction and ate while Shea remained in her 
hospital bed.

Her father 48-year-old Robbie Shaw of Los Gatos, told the Mercury News: 'She's becoming more alert. She shows emotion now. It's slow but positive progress.'

The teenager's family and friends have used Facebook to raise money, setting up a fundraising page called Angels For Shea.

The Los Gatos High School student was a popular member of the cheer leading squad according to her best friends, sisters Gabi and Hannah Alharayeri, who often sit with Shea by her hospital bed and fill her in on class gossip. 

They said their friend wants to study 
beauty therapy when she finishes high school after being inspired by her
mother Cari Shaw who is a hairdresser.

Outdoors: Shea loved spending time at her grandmother's home in rural Pennsylvania before she was hit by an SUV

Miss Shaw's grandmother Ann Shaw said that her granddaughter was fond of the outdoors when she visited her home in rural Pennsylvania. Mrs Shaw admitted that the girl faced an uphill struggle to get better.

Robbie Shaw, a demolition worker, said he hoped the money from the benefit would buy a van with a specialised lift for his daughter to help with her recovery.
