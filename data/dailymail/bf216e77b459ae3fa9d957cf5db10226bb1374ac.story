I'm a bit of a daredevil and I'll do almost anything.

But just moments after I agreed to attend the launch of Thorpe Park's Fright Nights, in a very unlike-me fashion, my stomach sank.

I don't like watching horror films, and I'm quite reluctant to get on a rollercoaster. What was I thinking?

To celebrate 13 years, horror author Michael Grant has collaborated to curate 13 new  characters

The launch got off to a good - albeit chilly - start on Wednesday night, with stars from TOWIE and Made In Chelsea attending, as well as supermodel-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne - and the Thorpe Park team looked after us with free cheeseburgers, Krispy Kremes and an open bar.

The theme park in Surrey has gone all-out for Halloween - including a new experienced called The Extra Cut. It's an overnight challenge that involves being locked up in the park, then gagged and blindfolded.

Thrill-seekers are then chased by a sacrificial cannibal cult who feast upon human flesh, and taken on a horrifying backstage tour of the Thorpe Park Movie Studios and horror mazes.

It sounds awful! And I was already having second, third and forth thoughts about just attending the launch night. I had roped in a friend - there was no way I was doing this alone.

As the night unfolded, there were terrifying actors in horror costume around every corner to scare the wits out of us - something revellers will also be able to enjoy during the park's Fright Night fest until November 2.

US horror author Michael Grant has curated 13 new scare characters for this year's event, to celebrate 13 years of Fright Nights.

After filling up on some fast food (probably not the best decision) I decided to brave SAW Alive: The Maze, designed by the same twisted people who created the Saw rollercoaster.

You go in in groups and by common assumption the person at the front usually gets the biggest scare as they see everything first and, well, they are basically a human shield for everyone else. 

My companion and I proceeded to queue up behind barbed wire to go inside. 

When we reached the front we were set to be first in, so we let a group go in front of us. Unlucky for us, there were seven of them, and only seven to eight go in at a time - so were at the front again.

We were finally allowed to join on the back of another group, but they were all screaming teenage girls that begged us to go in front. 

This was quite embarrassing; a twenty-something woman and man wimping out and making a couple of terrified girls lead the way. However, there was no way I was going first! 

After filling up on some fast food I braved SAW Alive: The Maze, located right next to the rollercoaster

Saw Alive: The Maze: Deni had to queue up behind barbed wire, then was scared out of her wits inside

An intense briefing began - heart problems? No entry. Epilepsy? No entry. Scare easily? Best not go in!

We had a photo-op with a model of the bike-riding Billy puppet, before entering the themed multi-room maze inspired by his nightmarish games. 

The 'extreme live action' attraction is like a walking ghost train, but with real people acting out horror characters instead of mannequins.

The first person we met on our journey was a security guy in his office: red flashing lights, screens showing CCTV footage, loud sirens. 

He told us it was chaos in there and we must absolutely not go in or we might not make it. Obviously, we had to. 

That famous scene with the large bathroom was the first room we entered. It was bloodied and gruesome; two actors were acting out a panicked scene. 

In another room, a woman was chained to a wooden structure, and it seemed like she had been that way for a long time. She was tapping the chain on the side of it; a long, depressed look on her face, like a lab monkey. 

Then suddenly she went mental, and in a fit of rage started smashing the heavy steel all over the room and everyone screamed and ran.

It was intense and highly disturbing, but once we made it out alive, it did feel like fun and games.   

Costumed characters make sure you're NOT sitting comfortably!

Before you go in here, and in fact before every attraction, you get a thorough briefing

Behind each door was a nightmarish being, including people hanging from walls and doors and ceilings

New this year is Thorpe Park's own made up horror movie studio maze, called Studio 13, full of similar jump-out-of-your-skin scare tactics. 

We tried this one out next, strobe lights and smoke obscuring our vision as we entered the room. A tall woman with a slick blonde up-do and dressed in a pencil dress lined us up and told us we were auditioning to act in a horror film.   

Her spiky face spread into a smile, she started eyeing us all up before stopping at me with her head tilted slightly and slowly walked towards me. 

I panicked and hid behind my laughing friend. 

The woman was now very close my heart was pounding; then she sharply looked at the person beside me. A very cool move.

She then released us and we were set to explore the studio, where our uncomfortable journey saw us climb through makeshift tunnels into bloodied make up booths, deserted motel themed sets and rooms filled with hanging body bags.  

After Studio 13 I felt it was time for a rollercoaster, so went on my favourite, Nemesis Inferno. It was so not scary compared to the mazes, and actually super fun.

That hyped me up for the next attraction.

Cabin In The Woods: The Maze is scariest: there is a horrible CLOWN!

Next on our list was Cabin In The Woods: The Maze, which actually won Best Halloween Scare Attraction at the ScareCon SCARs Awards 2014. 

It was certainly the scariest attraction of the night for me. There was a frightening clown character who picked on me. 

I screamed and screamed but the clown continued. They even removed their wing and chased me down the corridor!

My friend found it hilarious.

We entered a rustic cabin scene; just one room with lots of doors and no obvious route - we just had to guess the way, which was quite scary in itself. 

Behind each door was a nightmarish being, including individuals who looked like they were wearing latex masks or dressed in ghoulish attire - such as nightgowns with wigs but all stained and torn up like they'd been in a fight with a zombie

They would pop out from nowhere in a jerky, deranged fashion, getting close to our faces. Some were hanging from doors and ceilings, cornering us and scratching and nipping at our calves, making us jump.  

Some touched the back of my neck in a soft, creepy way, quickly tugging on my hair when I least expected it which made me jump! I had not screamed that much in ages.

There's something very eerie about riding rollercoasters on a foggy, slightly damp and chilly night

As well as spooky horror attractions, five of Thorpe Park's world-class rollercoasters stay open into the night, including THE SWARM, Stealth (very fast, very tall), Nemesis Inferno (feet-free and my favourite), Colossus (ten-loop tumble) and SAW - The Ride (with that daunting inverted drop). They're all included in the entry price.

All the other actor-led horror attractions - mostly mazes - are also based on cult classic horror films. They include The Blair Witch Project and My Bloody Valentine 3D. 

As we had only half an hour left in the park, we went on THE SWARM which was scary but not stomach-churning. It was great and I wish I had time to go on again.

If you're a bit of a scaredy cat like me, the thing to remember and learn from my experience is - you will be fine! And, being brave is good for you - nothing is as bad as you think.

And those who like to be scared will love it! And I think it will actually scare you quite a lot, maybe more than you expect.

The acting is truly brilliant, and there's something very eerie about riding rollercoasters on a foggy, slightly damp and chilly night. It's quite surreal and starkly different to my memories of theme parks in the summer sunshine.

 In fact it's so scary that the theme park has opened a Panic Room to calm guests down. 

The safe warren is filled with  25 bunnies, classical music and lavender trees and  makes for a stark contrast to the grotesque ghouls that roam the grounds during Fright Nights.
