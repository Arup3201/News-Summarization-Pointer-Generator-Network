Liverpool host rivals Manchester United on Sunday as both teams look to take another step towards securing a place in next season's Champions League.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at three of the key battles which could decide the game at Anfield. 

MARTIN SKRTEL v MAROUANE FELLAINI

The 6ft 4in Fellaini has given Manchester United a new dimension in recent weeks and has looked a better strike partner for Wayne Rooney than either Radamel Falcao or Robin van Persie. 

But if you needed the perfect warrior centre-half to combat Fellaini, Martin Skrtel would be high on your list. 

The shaven-headed stopper is fearless and as hard as nails. He knocked himself out making a challenge in an FA Cup tie against Blackburn earlier this month.

JORDAN HENDERSON vs MICHAEL CARRICK

Different type of midfield players but whoever gets the upper hand could have a decisive influence on the result. Henderson is all about energy and mobility and scored the winner at Swansea City on Monday night. 

Carrick’s range of passing is outstanding, he gets the other United players on the ball at the right time. Both are vice-captains of their club and rivals in Roy Hodgson’s England squad too.

DANIEL STURRIDGE vs PHIL JONES

Both players were tipped at one time to be the future of English football and are on the way back after injury. If Sturridge’s stealth and trickery win out, Liverpool will fancy their chances. 

But Jones is strong and will try to outmuscle the striker. Both have been named by England in the squad to face Lithuania and Italy and will be keen to show they are back to their best.
