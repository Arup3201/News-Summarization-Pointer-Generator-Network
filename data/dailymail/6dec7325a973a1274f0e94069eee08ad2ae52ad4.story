NBA star Richard Jefferson helped the FBI find $2million dollars after he claimed that his manager stole it from him. 

The Dallas Mavericks player accused Ted Kritza, his former business manager, of taking the $2million from his bank credit line without his permission.

Jefferson reportedly helped in an FBI investigation by recording a phone call he had with Kritza in which he confessed to taking the money.

Jefferson, 34, had reported the crime before the investigation began, according to documents obtained by TMZ sports. 

During a recorded phone call with the basketball player, Kritza 'confesses to wrongdoing', according to the documents.

The recording is now in the hands of the FBI. 

A bank has apparently sued Jefferson for part of the $2million, according to TMZ. 

Jefferson, however, wants the court to put a hold on the case until the federal investigation into Kritza is finished.

Jefferson started his NBA career in 2001 with the New Jersey Nets, where he stayed until 2008. 

The NBA forward then moved through the Milwaukee Bucks, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors and Utah Jazz before landing at the Mavericks last year.

This comes days after a most recent filing from former L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling's lawyers claimed that his wife Rochelle and two doctors worked 'secretly' with NBA commissioner to strip him of his team. 

'The NBA and Silver isolated Rochelle from her husband and scared her into undertaking certain conduct hereinafter alleged, including the signing of papers... that she did not understand,' the complaint reads. 'All of this conduct constituted elder abuse.'

Silver, who is also named as a defendant in the suit, banned Sterling from the NBA for life last year and hit him with a $2.5million fine after tapes were released of Sterling speaking racist slurs.
