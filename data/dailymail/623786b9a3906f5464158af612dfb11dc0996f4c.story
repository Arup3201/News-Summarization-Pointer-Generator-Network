A majority of mothers of newborns said that their Facebook use increased after birth - whereas fathers stay the same, and the increase can bump up stress say Ohio State researchers

You might think that the birth of a child would be a moment to spend some quality time with the real world - but it appears not.

A majority of mothers of newborns said that their Facebook use increased after birth - whereas fathers stay the same.

The 'habit' can also cause stress - at  a time that is already difficult for masy parents.

Mothers who were more frequent 
visitors to their Facebook accounts and who managed their accounts more 
frequently reported higher levels of parenting stress.

The researchers cautioned that they 
can't tell from this data whether more Facebook use caused stress for 
mothers, or if mothers with higher levels of stress were more likely to 
use Facebook frequently.

‘I think the most likely 
interpretation is that mothers who experience higher levels of stress 
are looking for social support on Facebook so they visit more often,’ 
she said.

‘I know that I see a lot of Facebook 
posts from new mothers talking about how their child wouldn't sleep, or 
how their second child was harder than their first. Stressed-out mothers
may be using Facebook to vent and to find help.’

Results showed that 44 percent of mothers said their Facebook use increased after giving birth, compared to 27 percent who said it decreased and 29 percent who said it stayed the same.

For fathers, 31 percent said their Facebook use increased, while 19 percent said it decreased and 51 percent said it stayed the same.

The majority of mothers - 58% - visited their accounts at least once a day, compared to 44 percent of fathers.

Nearly all women - 93% - said they 
had uploaded photos of their child to Facebook, while 83% of 
fathers said they did.

The study, published in the July issue of the journal Family Relations, is the first to investigate new parents' use of Facebook during this stressful life event.

The results offer some initial clues as to how Facebook use may affect new parents' adjustment to parenthood, according to the researchers.

The findings suggest that, despite all the new demands faced by new parents, spending time on Facebook was worthwhile to them, said Sarah Schoppe-Sullivan, co-author of the study and associate professor of human development and family science at Ohio State University.

‘Given all the stress that new parents are under and everything they have to manage, it wouldn't have been surprising if we had found a decrease in Facebook usage - but that's not what we found,’ Schoppe-Sullivan said.

‘These mothers may be taking time off from work, and may be far from family, so this network they created for themselves on Facebook can be very valuable in helping them cope,’ said Mitchell Bartholomew, lead author of the study and a graduate student in human development and family science at Ohio State.

The study involved 154 mothers and 150 fathers, most of whom were white and highly educated.

The data from this study came from questions asked nine months after the birth of their child.
