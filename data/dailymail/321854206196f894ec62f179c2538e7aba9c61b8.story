Star: Lindsay Lohan was ordered to wear an alcohol-monitoring tag after failing to show up for a probation hearing relating to a drink-driving case in 2007

She was famously ordered to wear one after failing to show up for a probation hearing relating to a drink-driving case.

Now, Hollywood star Lindsey Lohan's 'booze bracelet' will be fitted to alcohol-fuelled thugs in Britain.

Courts will have the power to issue the U.S.-style electronic tag, which records the wearer’s alcohol intake by measuring air and perspiration emissions from the skin every 30 minutes

At least once every 24 hours, the bracelet is connected to the internet to send alcohol levels to the probation officer. 

If the blood or sweat has an alcohol level of more than 0.02 then it will be followed up by a visit by the authorities.

The bracelet, often attached to the ankle, will be piloted in South London next month and could soon be rolled out across England and Wales.

It will handed to thugs in the boroughs of Croydon, Lambeth, Southwark and Sutton alongside community or suspended sentences, and can be sanctioned for up to four months.

Offenders will either be given a limit that they are allowed to drink, or banned from consuming alcohol together. 

Judges must be satisfied that alcohol was
 a contributing factor to the committed offence, but that the defendant 
is not an alcoholic in need of treatment.

The tag is part of the Alcohol Abstinence and Monitoring scheme, which aims to reduce the level of alcohol-related crime, ensure offenders face a 'robust' punishment and make the public safer by 'breaking the cycle of alcohol-related crime'. 

Film star Lohan was fitted with a U.S.-made SCRAM - Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitory - tag in
 2007 after she failed to show up for a probation hearing relating to a 
drink-driving case.

She was later ordered to wear another 
alcohol-monitoring bracelet in 2010 after a judge ruled she had failed 
to complete alcohol education classes imposed as part of her sentencing 
for the case.

Punishment: Courts will have the power to issue the U.S.-style electronic tag (pictured, a SCRAM tag), which records the convict's alcohol intake by measuring air and perspiration emissions from the skin every half hour

Emily Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said she was 'encouraged' to see the scheme enter the UK, saying: 'About half of all crime is alcohol related so it’s encouraging to see pilots like this.'

However, the makers of SCRAM warned that while exercise is not an issue, spray tans and perfumes containing alcohol could accidentally set off the tag's sensor.

There have also been occasions in the US where eating a yeasty bread or bread with lots of raisins has triggered the alarm, according to reports.

A spokesman for the Mayor's Office told MailOnline: 'The Alcohol Abstinence and Monitoring scheme will be piloted in the London boroughs of Sutton, Croydon, Lambeth and Southwark from July 31.

'The Alcohol Abstinence and Monitoring Requirement (AAMR) requirement is already law. Under the AAMR, an individual can be required to abstain from alcohol for a fixed period of time as part of a community order or suspended sentence order.

'An order has been signed by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to commence the pilot.'

The 'booze bracelet' senses the body’s intake of any alcohol by measuring air and perspiration emissions from the skin every 30 minutes.

At least once every 24 hours, the tag is connected to the internet to send alcohol levels to the probation officer.

If the blood or sweat has an alcohol level of more than 0.02 then it will be followed up by a visit by the authorities.

Pilot: The alcohol-monitoring bracelet, often attached to the ankle, will be piloted in South London next month

There have been occasions in the United States where eating a yeasty bread or bread with lots of raisins has triggered the alarm, but experts say it has a very high rate of success.

Critics also say that if not cleaned properly then the system can also misread alcohol levels.
