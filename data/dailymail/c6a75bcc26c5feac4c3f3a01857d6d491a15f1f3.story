Woolworths has pulled a controversial singlet which featured the slogan 'If you don't love it, leave' from the shelves of two stores, after the supermarket giant was accused of racism.

The company came under sustained attack on social media on Monday afternoon after an image of the men's singlet on sale at a Cairns store went viral.

The company's Facebook page was deluged with negative comments, with some shoppers announcing they would boycott the store. 

But Woolworths told Daily Mail Australia the singlet had been ordered in error.

'Selling racist singlets for everyday low prices'

'It has come to our attention that two Woolworths stores were inadvertantly stocking a singlet that we consider totally unacceptable,' a company spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.

'The singlet was not one we ordered. It was delivered to us in error and should never been allowed on our shelves. We will review our processes to ensure this sort of error cannot happen again.'

'As soon as we were made aware we immediately withdrew the product from our shelves.' 

The Woolworths spokesman said the singlet's sentiments did not reflect the company's views.

But many customers had already made their anger clear. 

On the Woolworths Facebook page, Zoh Dowling wrote: 'There's no way on earth I'm spending my weekly shopping budget at a supermarket who thinks it's fine to sell racism themed apparel.'

Kym Watling said: 'Get rid of the racist shirts and sack whoever thought it was a good idea.'Shopper Carl Redfern, who said his family usually shopped at Woolworths in Marrickville, quipped: 'Hey Woolworths I DON'T LOVE the racist singlets you're selling, so guess what I'm going to LEAVE.'

The image went viral after it was shared on the Facebook page of Greens MP Adam Bandt. 

'Divisive and ridiculous - these should be pulled immediately,' a post written by 'Team Bandt' said. 

Earlier this year, a range of T-shirts sold by the supermarket Aldi were pulled from the shelves after accusations of racism. 

The T-shirts featured logos which said: 'AUSTRALIA EST 1788'.
