It’s no secret that the Obamas run a tight ship when it comes to parenting 14-year-old Malia and 11-year-old Sasha, especially now the girls are fast heading into the tumultuous teenage years.

As well as recounting endless anecdotes about their daughters, the first couple have mentioned various household rules they set for their girls over the past four years.

But, when it comes to campaigning, it seems the girls number one rule is to be seen and not heard. Smiling and waving - yes, and lots of it. Talking - no, thank you.

Smile and wave: Malia, left, and Sasha, right, appear with their parents during the final day of the DNC; it seems the girls number one rule is to be seen and not heard

Cosy: The White House released a heart-warming photo of Malia and Sasha snuggled up on a couch with their father as they watched their mother give her moving convention speech on Tuesday night

And the two girls, now all grown up, 
excelled themselves on Thursday night when they made a composed 
appearance at their father's DNC speech.

When not on the political trail themselves, the girls are frequently 
referenced by their parents, appear in campaign videos and on 
promotional posters.

But, as the New York Times pointed out, the sisters are barely ever heard speaking.

'They are a bit of a mystery,'  J. J. Abrams, an Obama donor and  Hollywood writer-director, said of the sisters. 'But they’re authentic, and we’re starving for that,' he told the Times.

Indeed, as Obama’s re-election campaign forges ahead, his daughters will be his not-so-secret but silent weapon.

The girls clearly help Obama portray a family-man image and the President recounts carefully selected stories about them whenever he can - to the chagrin of his opponents. 

Family Man: Barack and Michelle Obama have always picked carefully selected stories to tell about their daughters, Sasha, centre, and Malia, left. This 2009 picture shows just how much the girls have grown up since their father entered office

Back then: Malia (left) and Sasha (center right) were only 10 and 7 years old respectively when they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in Denver in 2008 on the night their father accepted the nomination

The discipline to be seen and not 
heard, the oldest in the book, will be easy for Malia and Sasha who are 
known to have strict rules set at home.

Those household rules, largely set by
mom-in-chief Michelle, which have been compiled by the New York Times, 
offer a glimpse of what home life is like for the youngsters.

Here are some of the rules that Michelle and Barack have confessed to laying down:

(Incidentally, when they do watch TV, the girls are said to enjoy Modern Family.)

Laying down the law: It is no secret that Michelle and Barack set strict rules for their daughters, including no technology during the week

Color coordinated: On election night 2008, it was clear that someone else picked out the girl's outfits. More recently, it appears that the girls have had more of a say in their attire as they begin to experiment

Most changed: While both girls have obviously 
matured, Sasha, who wore peach at the inauguration (left) and was only 7
when she moved into the White House, looks much older now (right)

Vacation time: This past Christmas, in 2011, the first family traveled to their father's home state of Hawaii

The girls were back in the spotlight 
this week when they made an appearance at the President’s 
poorly-received speech in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday night.

The day before, The White House 
released a heart-warming photo of Malia and Sasha snuggled up on a couch
with their father as they watched their mother give her moving 
convention speech on Tuesday night.

The girls were unable to join their 
mother in Charlotte on the night of her speech- which has received 
almost universal praise- because it was their first day of school.

Sasha is now in sixth grade at 
Sidwell Friends School, which they chose to attend once their father was
elected and they moved to Washington, D.C

Malia just had her first day of high school on Tuesday, reaching a milestone in her education thus far.

President and First Lady Obama sat 
down with People magazine during a campaign stop towards the end of 
August and at that time they said how there was a lot to think about in 
terms of back-to-school preparations and Malia's transition to high 
school.

'She's going to be great. The truth 
is my girls, they don't seem to have all the flaws I had when I was 
their age. They're just good kids- smart, hardworking, kind, and 
respectful. They'll adjust really well,' Mr Obama said.

Pictures show how much Sasha, 11, and Malia, 14 have changed since their father took office four years ago

@highlight

The girls watched as their mom gave moving Convention speech Tuesday

@highlight

They had to stay in Washington, D.C. as it was their first day of school

@highlight

When the girls go on trips they 
must write reports on what they have done and seen. This must be 
completed regardless of whether the school requires a report.

@highlight

During the week, technology is banned.  The sisters can only use computers for homework and are forbidden from watching TV during the week.

@highlight

Malia and Sasha are forbidden from using Facebook until they are 17.
In an interview earlier this year President Barack Obama said he banned
his daughters from the social networking site because he does not want 
‘strangers knowing our business’.

@highlight

Cellphones: Malia was allowed a cellphone when she was 12, but again, is only allowed to use it on the weekends. Sasha has been told she will have to wait another year before her mother even thinks about giving her a mobile.

@highlight

Malia and Sasha must take up two sports: they are allowed to pick one of the sports and the other is chosen by their mother.
Michelle previously explained the policy: 'I want them to understand 
what it feels like to do something you don’t like and to improve.’

@highlight

Malia must know how to do her own laundry before she leaves for college.

@highlight

The girls must eat their greens. 
If they say they are not hungry when confronted with vegetables, they 
are not allowed chips or cookies later. 'If you’re full, you’re full. I don’t want to see you in the kitchen after that,' Mrs. Obama told Ladies’ Home Journal.
