A North Carolina man has filed a lawsuit accusing the notorious affairs website Ashley Madison of breaking up his 13-year marriage.

Robert Schindler's lawsuit, originally filed last year, names the infidelity website, its Canadian parent company, Avid Dating Life Inc, and his ex-wife's lover, Eleazar 'Chay' Montemayor.

According to court documents, Montemayor, 58, a married professor of civil engineering, and Schindler’s wife, 51-year-old Teresa Moore, first met on Ashley Madison in 2007 and soon began an affair.

Last October, Mr Montemayor and his paramour got married after divorcing their respective spouses.

Schindler’s complaint cited by Charlotte Observer seeking more than $10,000 alleges that Montemayor, Ashley Madison and its parent company came between him and his wife and 'alienated and destroyed' their love.

North Carolina is one of only a handful of states that still have archaic alienation of affection/criminal conversation laws on the books allowing scorned spouses to seek punitivie damages when a marriage fails due to the actions of a third party.

In Schnidler's case, the cuckolded 62-year-old husband claims that the infidelity website and Montemayor alienated his wife, who then went on to have 'criminal conversation - a legal term for extramarital sex - with her paramour. 

Noel Biderman, the founder of the cheating portal - and a married father of two - dismissed the claims outlined in the lawsuit as nonsensical, telling the paper that his company is no more liable for someone's split than a hotel room where a tryst had taken place, or a cell phone operator who made it possible for the lovers to communicate.

The former attorney and sports agent added that Ashley Madison connects people online but is no way responsible for what their clients choose to do offline.

‘I think it would be an incredibly slippery slope to attempt to espouse blame to all the technology and inanimate objects that were utilized in an affair,’ he told the paper.

However, Schindler's attorney, Christopher Johnson, pointed out that Biderman's argument does not hold water because unlike a hotel room or a cell phone, which have other purposes besides fostering unfaithfulness, Ashley Madison's sole raison d'etre is to promote affairs.

In fact, the company's motto prominently displayed on its homepage goads: 'Life is short. Have an affair.'

The portal, which has been in operation since 2002, boasts nearly 23million members and purports to be 'the most famous name in infidelity and married dating.'

'Ashley Madison is the most successful website for finding an affair and cheating partners,' the company description claims. 'Have an Affair today on Ashley Madison.

'Thousands of cheating wives and cheating husbands sign up every day looking for an affair. We are the most famous website for discreet encounters between married individuals.'

Schindler's lawsuit has ample precedent in North Carolina. In 2010, a wronged wife was awarded $9million against her husband’s mistress.

The following year, a judge ruled in favor of a Raleigh businessman’s former wife who sued her replacement, awarding her the largest judgement in state history - $30million.

In 2009, state lawmakers passed a measure protecting employers from being sued under the alienation law since affairs often begin in the workplace.

Now, legal action for breaking up a marriage can be pursued only against a 'natural person' - but Schindler's attorney said that since his client's ex-wife struck up a relationship with another man in 2007, two years before the passage of the legislation, Ashley Madison could still be on the hook for thousands of dollars.
