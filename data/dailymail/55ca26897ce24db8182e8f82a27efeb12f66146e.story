President Obama's latest 'executive order' saw a military couple booted off a golf course where they planned to get married so he could play a round with his friends.

Army Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr had their wedding moved off an Oahu, Hawaii Marine Corps base golf course on Sunday after the president decided to play the course at the last minute. 

The bride and groom learned of the decision the day before their ceremony was planned to take place at the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course, which has picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean. 

Sorry: Army Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr planned to get married at the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course on Sunday, but had to move their ceremony at the last minute because President Obama wanted to play the course.

Ironically, the couple knew the president would be in town and sent him an invite on a whim, and received a polite decline just hours before they learned they could no longer get married at their desired location. 

'It was emotional, especially for [Heimel]—she’s the bride and in less than 24 hours they had to change everything they had planned,' the groom's sister Jamie McCarthy told Bloomberg.

The wedding instead took place on the green lawn of the Marine Corps base where the golf course is located, and many attendants posted pictures of the ceremony online with the hashtag #ThanksObama.

President Obama and his family are currently vacationing on his home state of Hawaii for the Christmas holidays, and he has played golf six times in the past nine days. 

Yesterday he took to the course with friends Mike Ramos, Greg Orme and Bobby Titcomb. 

However, it appears the president didn't know that his golf game interrupted a military wedding, since he reached out to the newlyweds to apologize. In a picture posted to Instagram, the couple were seen at the ceremony answering a call from the commander in chief.

'He apologized and congratulated them,' McCarthy said. 

'We were all there, it was perfect,' she added . 'Made their day.'

According to Naile Brennan, manager of the catering company which worked on the wedding, anyone planning a wedding at the course are warned that the president can interrupt events when he is in town.
