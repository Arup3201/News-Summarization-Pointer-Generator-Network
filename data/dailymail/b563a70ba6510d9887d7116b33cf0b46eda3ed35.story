Brendan Rodgers has warned Roy Hodgson not to pick Daniel Sturridge for England duty next week as he says the striker will not be fit.

The Liverpool manager was furious with England’s handling of the striker during the last international break, believing he aggravated his thigh problem after being pushed too hard.

Sturridge did not travel to Switzerland for tonight’s Champions League game but he could figure this weekend against West Bromwich.

Yet Rodgers said: ‘Whether he is available for West Brom or not, he won’t be fit. We are hoping he can train with the team on Thursday.

‘We hope he’ll be available on Saturday. But if you are talking about a player’s availability for England they need to be fit to play and Daniel will not be fit to play.

‘It’s something we have stressed. My focus is on protecting Liverpool players and, at this moment, my focus is on getting him fit for Liverpool.’

England host San Marino next Thursday and travel to Estonia the following Sunday.
