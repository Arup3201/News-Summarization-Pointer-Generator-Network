A second woman has revealed her identity claiming she was abused by former CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi.

Author and lawyer Reva Seth says she met Ghomeshi in 2002 as a 26-year-old after starting a new job in Toronto, Canada.

She claims the pair 'kissed' a few times before the 47-year-old became 'a different person, super angry, almost frenzied and disassociated'.

The founder of radio show Q was fired from the program on Sunday, amid accusations of sexual assault, which he claimed were started by a jilted ex-girlfriend looking for revenge.

His lawyers have allegedly moved to sue the public-funded broadcasting company for $55million, claiming he was fired over a 'moral judgement' of his BDSM lifestyle.

But Seth has gone public to describe her allegations against him - claiming he once 'had his hand around my throat' before abusing her.

The mother-of-three, who wrote the book 'MomShift', wrote an account of her alleged abuse in a blog published by The Huffington Post Canada.

So far, nine women have come forward to claim Ghomeshi slapped, choked and verbally assaulted them on dates and at work in the past 12 years.

Actress Lucy DeCoutere, who stars on the television show Trailer Park Boys, was the first of those to identify herself. Others have decided to remain anonymous, fearing  online bullying.  

Seth described in the blog how Ghomeshi was 'funny and charming,' when the pair first started seeing each other casually.

But one evening, she claims, his behaviour suddenly changed.

She wrote: 'When it was over, I got up and it was clear I was really angry. My sexual interactions until then had always been consensual, enjoyable and fun.

'He gave me some weird lines about how he couldn’t tell if I was actually attracted to him or not. And somehow this was meant to explain his behaviour.'

Afterwards she decided not to involve the police and opted not to come forward fearing the impact of online trolls.

But she eventually decided to reveal her identity after hearing Lucy DeCoutere speaking on CBC about her 'remarkably similar experience'.

Yesterday, Ghomeshi issued a short statement thanking his Facebook followers for their support and saying he would not be discussing the matter further with the media.

DeCoutere says she first met Ghomeshi at a barbecue in Banff, Canada, in 2003, and that they later met up in Toronto to have dinner. 

She says throughout the meal, Ghomeshi went on about how famous he was and 'how lucky you are to be with me'. 

After dinner, they went back to Ghomeshi's house where they began making out. But things soon turned violent when she claims Ghomeshi pushed her against a wall, choked her and slapped her three times.

'He did not ask if I was into it. It was never a question. It was shocking to me. The men I have spent time with are loving people,' said DeCoutere, who also works as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force when she is not acting. 

DeCoutere promptly left in a taxi. 

The Star goes on to detail each account from the other seven victims, which occurred as early as 2002 and as recently as 2013.

Fired: Ghomeshi was fired from his radio show Q on Sunday amid allegations of sexual assault. He says he was wrongly terminated after executives found out about his BDSM lifestyle. Nine women are saying their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi were not consensual

Three of the women met Ghomeshi in 2012, when he was touring the country to support his autobiography, and two of the women are co-workers. 

One of the women says she was in a work meeting with Ghomeshi when they were left alone in a room and he leaned over to say: 'I want to hate f*** you'. 

While the woman claims to have reported Ghomeshi's inappropriate behavior, including a time when he grabbed her buttocks, to her union supervisor, she doesn't believe the host was ever punished.

The CBC says it is now investigating the incident. 

Another CBC producer says she met Ghomeshi during his book tour and that she was attacked by him in a hotel room. She didn't report the incident because she 'felt like Jian was a CBC god'.

Two of the women also told the story of Big Ears Teddy, a stuffed animal that played a role in their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi.

One woman who was invited over to Ghomeshi's house says he turned the teddy bear to face away from the bed saying: 'Big Ears Teddy shouldn't see this'.  

On Sunday, the CBC announced that Ghomeshi would no longer be working for the network in a vague statement saying recently-revealed information 'precludes us from continuing our relationship'.

Following that announcement, the Toronto Star published their first article with four accounts from alleged victims.

The ninth anonymous woman met him at a Christmas media party more than a decade ago.

She described the radio show host and musician as 'smitten' with her and she in turn said she was charmed by his charismatic personality.

Their first date was to watch him tape his own show and they socialized with his colleagues and then went to a bar afterwards to talk.

She said he was only charming and gave her no reason at all to worry.

He drove her home and while in the car on the way to hers he came on to her and asked her if she would undo her blouse buttons, she claims.

She said 'no' at which point, the woman alleges, Ghomeshi reached over and grabbed her hair and pulled her head back.

He then allegedly said something like 'how do you like that?' The woman then said she asked him to stop and she got out of the car.

The woman though, told CBC that she agreed to see him again, because she thought he 'might just have been too rough' - but nothing that couldn't be ironed out.

On the second date, she brought a friend along but then at the end of the evening went back to his house.

The two got friendly back at his and during a clinch she alleges that he pulled her hair again, this time only harder and then began to punch her on the ears till she cried.

The anonymous woman then fled his home and went to a friends house and cried throughout the night.

When asked why she didn't press charges or call the police, the woman said she only wanted to curl up in a corner.

She said she was so shocked by the seemingly charming man's violence that it left her feeling only shock - but now she wishes she had gone to the police.

Ghomeshi responded to his dismissal by writing a Facebook post claiming a spurned ex-girlfriend started spreading sexual assault rumors.

In the post, Ghomeshi speaks about his sexual preferences saying: 'I have always been interested in a variety of activities in the bedroom but I only participate in sexual practices that are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners.' 

Ghomeshi goes on to say that he revealed all of this to his employers in an attempt to be transparent about the allegations, in case the story was ever published. 

He says last week he gave the network 'proof' that the sexual relationship was consensual, and that while his employers believed him they decided to terminate his contract, afraid that if his sexual life became public, it would cause a scandal.

'CBC execs confirmed that the information provided showed that there was consent. In fact, they later said to me and my team that there is no question in their minds that there has always been consent. They said they’re not concerned about the legal side. 

'But then they said that this type of sexual behavior was unbecoming of a prominent host on the CBC. They said that I was being dismissed for "the risk of the perception that may come from a story that could come out." To recap, I am being fired in my prime from the show I love and built and threw myself into for years because of what I do in my private life.'  

Ghomeshi has been at the CBC for 14 years, and has been the host of the popular radio show Q, which he founded, since 2007. 

Recent interviews include Lena Dunham, Jamie Oliver and Ethan Hawke.
