A Mormon University in Utah has removed  cards celebrating same-sex marriage from its bookshop because they violate the school's honour code.

Card maker Hallmark apparently stocked Brigham Young University shop with 'Mr and Mr' and 'Mrs and Mrs' cards without realising that the religious school does not support same-sex unions.

It is not known how long the cards were on the shelves for but they were quickly removed after pictures surfaced online, according to a university spokeswoman.

Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has removed 'Mr and Mr' and 'Mrs and Mrs' cards from its bookshop after card maker Hallmark stocked them without realising the religious school opposes same-sex marriage 

The BYU code states that being attracted to people of the same gender is acceptable, acting on those feelings is a violation.

Founded by Brigham Young, leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in 1875, the school was established as a strict religious institution.

Founded as Brigham Young Academy, Mr Young is said to have told the principal: 'Remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God.'

Today it serves 27,000 undergraduate students and has sister campuses in Idaho, Hawaii and Salt Lake City.

'Homosexual behavior includes not only sexual relations between members of the same sex, but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings,' it states.

BYU is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has stood behind its belief that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.

Staff at BYU have spoken with the company about leaving similar cards off university store shelves in the future. The school doesn't plan on ending its contract with Hallmark.

'This was just someone stocking the shelves who wasn't aware," she said. "We've been able to work with them.'

A call to Hallmark wasn't immediately returned.

Samy Galvez, president of the group Understanding Same Gender Attraction, said changes to the honor code in 2007 and 2010 allowed students to talk about their sexual orientation without fear of being expelled.

Though he declined to comment on the greeting cards, calling it an accident, Galvez said he's generally found a welcoming environment at BYU.

The BYU honour code states that while being attracted to people of the same sex is not forbidden, acting on those impulses is a violation
