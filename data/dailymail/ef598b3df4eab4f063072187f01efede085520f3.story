Criticism: Orson Welles looked down on many actors

Hailed as a genius for films like Citizen Kane and The Third Man, actor and director Orson Welles had a low opinion of many of the stars who were then icons of Hollywood.

He branded Charlie Chaplin 'arrogant', Laurence Olivier 'stupid', Spencer Tracey 'hateful', James Stewart 'a bad actor' and 'couldn't stand' looking at Bette Davis.

He snubbed the golden couple of Tinsel Town, when Richard Burton tried to introduce his wife Elizabeth Taylor as he had lunch at a restaurant, describing the actor as a 'joke with a celebrity wife.'

But he was a big fan of John Wayne, lauding the cowboy legend and described Joseph Cotton, his co-star in The Third Man, as 'brilliant.'

Welles' insulting criticisms were made in private conversations that were taped by a friend in 1983. The actor had planned to use them for a biography, but died of a heart attack just days after their last meeting two years later.

The tapes lay undiscovered in the garage of his friend and fellow director Henry Jaglom for more almost 30 years. They will be published next month under the title My Lunches with Orson.

Film historian Peter Biskind, who has had access to the tapes, told the Observer Welles let 'his hair down' in the intimate interviews in which he reflects on his career and the stars he met.

Under fire: Welles described Spencer Tracey as  'hateful' and couldn't stand looking at Bette Davis

Targets: Norma Shearer was 'minimally talented' and Joan Fontaine had 'two expressions and that's it'

Biskind said: 'He's not the great 
director being interviewed by a starry-eyed journalist. He's speaking to
 a friend, and is therefore free to gossip.'

Welles had no time for a lot of actresses in the thirties and forties. Joan Fontaine who had 'two expressions, and that's it'. Norma Shearer was 'one of the most minimally talented ladies to appear on the silver screen'.

'I never could stand looking at Bette 
Davis, so I don't want to see her act,' he said, also dismissing 
Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Jones as 'hopeless'.

Criticised: James Stewart 'overacted' in Rear Window with Grace Kelly

But he admired John Wayne who had 'some of the best manners of almost any actor I've ever met in Hollywood'.

Welles recalled how he insulted 
Richard Burton who approached him in the restaurant, saying: 'Elizabeth 
[Taylor] is with me. She so much wants to meet you. Can I bring her 
over?'

Welles, reported the Observer, replied: 'No. As you can see, I'm in the middle of my lunch.'

Jaglom berated Welles for rudeness, saying that Burton 'actually backed away, like a whipped puppy'.

Welles responded: 'Burton had great talent. He's ruined his great gifts. He's become a joke with a celebrity wife. Now he just works for money, does the worst shit.'

Snubbed: Richard Burton wanted to introduce Elizabeth Taylor to Orson Welles at a restaurant, but he said no

Insulted: Humphrey Bogart was rapped for 'picking fights' and Laurence Olivier was described as 'stupid'

Cowboy fan: Orson Welles admired Hollywood legend John Wayne for his manners

He once dated Marilyn Monroe before she was a star - taking her to parties in a bid to promote her career. But he was snubbed by powerful studio boss Darryl F Zanuck.

He told Welles: 'She's just another 
stock player. We've got a hundred of them.' A few months later, she became Zanuck's golden girl.

He criticised Casablanca star Humphrey Bogart for 'picking fights in nightclubs' and referred to Olivier's first two scenes of King Lear on the BBC as 'the worst things I ever saw in my life'.

He saved his worst  insults for Spencer Tracy and loathed 'those romantic Katharine Hepburn 'things'. 'He was just a hateful, hateful man.'

He said of James Stewart' in Rear Window  with Grace Kelly: 'I'll tell you what is astonishing... to discover that Jimmy Stewart can be a bad actor … even Grace Kelly is better than Jimmy, who's overacting.'
