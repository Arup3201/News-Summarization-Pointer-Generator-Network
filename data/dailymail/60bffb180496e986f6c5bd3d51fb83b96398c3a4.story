Police in Italy believe that a murdered prostitute who was found stripped naked and ‘crucified’ could have been the victim of a serial killer.

The 26-year-old Romanian was found dead beneath a bridge in Ugnano, a village near Florence, hanging from a cross.  

The woman, identified as Andrea Cristina Zamfir, was completely naked except for her shoes and was bound with tape to an iron bar in a position similar to crucifixion.

Investigators have not ruled out that the woman may have been the victim of a serial killer given that a year ago an Italian prostitute was found in the same place and in a similar state, although she was still alive.

‘For now all we can assume is that we are dealing with a case of a client who killed a prostitute. Our investigations will also determine if there is any connection between this death and the case that happened a year ago, when a prostitute was found by a client in a similar position. Fortunately, she was still alive’, said one of the investigators.

A local police inspector said the woman had a slow and terrible death after being found in the crucifixion position

Police have begun house-to-house enquiries in a bid to track down her killer. The victim had a criminal record in Italy for prostitution, and was identified through her fingerprints.

Sources in the investigation said evidence shows that the dead woman was sexually abused before she was taped to the iron bar and then abandoned.

The allegations are supported by numerous bruises on her arms and back, showing that she tried hard to free herself.

A local police inspector said she had a terrible and slow death.

He added: ‘The woman was found by a cyclist under the bridge in an area known to be frequented by prostitutes and drug users.’
