After a hectic New York Fashion Week schedule, Ivanka Trump indulged in some mother-child bonding time over the holiday weekend.

The 31-year-old real estate heiress posted a photograph to Instagram yesterday showing her tenderly bottle feeding her five-month-old baby, Joseph Frederick.

It is not clear where the shot was taken, but the statuesque blonde is seen sat on a three-seater sofa set within a vast high-ceiling apartment. Giant patio windows reveal a snowy landscape outside.

Ms Trump captioned the image: 'No better way to enjoy this holiday weekend.'

Many commentators praised her for posting such a 'sweet' and 'beautiful' picture but some criticized her for not breastfeeding.

However, one wrote in response to the negative remarks: 'Calm down everyone.

'Whether she breastfeeds or not is her business. Also, I doubt she would post a pic of her breastfeeding here on Instagram.'

Love to give: The New York-based fashion designer recently revealed that she now 'feels like a pro' when it comes to balancing work and motherhood after having two children within the space of 27 months

New York-based Ms Trump recently revealed that she now 'feels like a pro' when it comes to 
balancing work and motherhood after having two children within the space
 of 27 months.

She gave birth to Arabella Rose in July 2011 and Joseph Fredrick last October.

'I am 
familiar with timing and balance as well as bathing, diapers and how to 
hold a baby without fear of an accident. I feel like I am now a pro!' 
she exclaimed.

However, the working 
mother who runs her own fashion label alongside promoting her father's 
real estate empire, did have an extra pair of hands to help out.

She
 previously told the South China Morning Post that she hired an 
'incredible' Chinese nanny to help look after Arabella as she returned 
to the office one week after her birth.

Family time: Ms Trump usually fills her Instagram feed with pictures of her brood

'We do things together as a family. And it's so cute to watch Arabella hold her baby brother - she is very protective'

As well as keeping a watchful eye on the youngster, the childminder also gave her lessons in Mandarin.

'My
 daughter doesn't speak much yet, but she seems to know as many words in
 Mandarin in terms of understanding what they mean as she does in 
English,' Ms Trump said. 

But as her Instagram account reveals, she maintains a hands-on approach when she's at home.

Indeed,
 almost all of her photographs show her doing some kind of activity with
 her two young children - from cooking to playing dress-up.

One recent snap, posted on Valentine's Day, shows Arabella and Joseph greeting her with a giant bouquet of red roses.

Ms Trump's businessman husband, Jared Kushner, who she married at a lavish ceremony in 2009, also plays an active role.

She recently described him as 'the best father' who, despite his busy schedule, prioritizes spending time with his brood.

'We love to go on adventures and play games and pick leaves,' the millionairess told People.

'We do things together as a family. And it’s so cute to watch Arabella hold her baby brother - she is very protective.’

In
 a previous interview with MailOnline Ms Trump didn't rule out having 
more children. She imagined 'three or four' as an ideal number.
