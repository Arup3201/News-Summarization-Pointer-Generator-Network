Now the strains and stresses of his failed bid for the White House are over, Mitt Romney has no doubt enjoyed time unwinding with his family.

And that's exactly what he did on Saturday, as he was spotted enjoying date night with his wife Ann in California.

Grainy photographs show the pair heading to the Cinepolis movie theatre in the coastal town of Del Mar to watch the new Twilight film, after Romney previously admitted he was a fan of the franchise.

They then headed for dinner at Sammy's, a pizza restaurant across the street.

According to TMZ, the couple was joined by two unidentified young men and did not have a security detail in sight.

Romney was reportedly extremely friendly with fellow diners and even posed for pictures.

The couple were presumably visiting the movie theatre from their house, valued at $8.75 million, in San Diego's nearby upmarket La Jolla neighborhood.

Romney's
 choice of movie does not come as a surprise, after he 
previously admitted in a bizarre interview with NBC that he reads the 
books by Stephenie Meyer.

'I like silly stuff too,' Romney told NBC during the presidential campaign. 'I mean, I like the Twilight series. I thought it was fun.'

'You like vampires?' the interviewer quizzed.

'I don't like vampires personally,' he replied awkwardly. 'I don't know any, but you know my granddaughter was reading it and I thought, "Well this looks like fun," so I read that.'

And, as TMZ pointed out, the author of the Twilight series is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - which is no doubt a hit with the Romney clan.
