Police have recovered the body of second missing snowboarder, Martie Buckland, 33, a day after friend Daniel Kerr was found buried under 4.5 metres of snow at Mount Bogong in Victoria.

Inspector Dave Ryan from Wangaratta police said Mr Buckland was found 60 metres up the same slope from where Mr Kerr's body was recovered on Monday, and it appears he was buried under the same dump of snow which claimed his friend.

'They unfortunately have both been caught up in the one avalanche,' he said.

A Victoria Police spokeswoman said Mr Buckland was discovered at about 10.30am on Tuesday buried underneath snow 'quite close' to where Mr Kerr's body was located on Monday.

The men, described as experienced skiers, had been missing three days before the body of Mr Kerr was found some 400 metres down a slope in the Eskdale Spur area of Mount Bogong.

Buckland from Yarra Junction, Victoria, and Kerr from Hawthorn, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, hadn't been seen since Thursday after failing to return from their snowboarding trip to Eskdale Spur.

Inspector Ryan said both families had been notified on Monday of the snowboarders' death, but spoke again to the family of Mr Buckland this morning.

He said both the wife and father were distraught, but relieved that the 33-year-old had been found.

'That extra day of waiting would have added a lot of pressure,' he said.

He said failing weather conditions will hamper the rescue effort to bring Mr Buckland more than three kilometres down the mountain, admitting that it could take up to five  six hours.

'We can't use a helicopter because of the snow which is falling at about 1640 metres.'

Both bodies will now be sent to the coroner in Melbourne.

Inspector Dave Ryan from Wangaratta police said the man's body was dug out of the snow about 400 metres down a slope on Eskdale Spur

'They have been in the area on a number of occasions and they've been caught out,' a Victoria Police officer said.

'While you may be a good snowboarder or skier, there are so many other things you have to worry about.'

The search for the experienced snowboarders resumed at first light on Monday morning.

Mrs Buckland said in a joint statement with Mr Kerr's parents, Marg and Phil Kerr, on Sunday that her husband knew the mountain 'like the back of his hand,' The Age reports.

'We are absolutely devastated by the news of Martie and Daniel's disappearance and hope with every passing minute that we are told they have been found safe,'  the statement said.

The snowboarders had been friends since Year 7 at school.

'Our families want to stress how experienced and prepared Martie and Daniel were for this trip, keenly aware of both the risks and the unpredictable nature the outdoors offer,' the statement continued.

'Their local knowledge of Mt Bogong and the surrounds, combined with their equipment and experience just adds to the frustration of dealing with their disappearance.'

A local expert said the men were in 'some of the most exciting and extreme and potentially dangerous terrain' in Victoria.

Rescue teams searched the back country for the two snowboarders, who failed to return from a trip to Mount Bogong in Victoria on Saturday

Police said the men signed a trip intention book on Wednesday which indicated their plans to stay at Michell Hut and then camp on Eskdale spur, before returning on Saturday.

After making contact with family members on Thursday via mobile phone, the men had not been heard from since.

A group of walkers found their abandoned tent containing sleeping bags and other equipment.

'It appears that no-one has been at the campsite since the last snow fall which was approximately 18 hours ago,' Victorian police said in a statement on Sunday morning.

After making contact with family members on Thursday via mobile phone, the men were never heard from again.

The volunteers participating in the search were made up of members of the Birkebeiner Nordic Ski Club, Bush Search and Rescue, State Emergency Services as well as a number of off duty ski patrollers from Falls Creek.

Their campsite at Mitchell hut was found abandoned by a group of walkers at around 6am on Sunday, causing police to be concerned that the men had not been at the campsite since the last snow fall, 18 hours earlier

It's not the first of such incidents occurring at Mount Bogong, where extreme weather conditions led to a bush-walker requiring rescuing on Wednesday after he became stranded on the mountain's summit.

A Search and rescue team found the man in a disoriented state but were not able to descend the mountain due to the 100k/h winds and the -10deg wind-chill.

Instead, they were forced to put up two tents and wait for a break in the weather conditions.

Search and Rescue Sergeant Vic Velthuis said the area was subject to extreme weather and sudden condition changes.

'There are a number of factors that hikers should consider before setting off into the high country. Planning, knowing your limitations and appropriate clothing being at the forefront,' she said.

'If you do get disorientated, stay calm and stay where you are in a sheltered dry spot and remember that it could take some time for rescuers to get to you.'
