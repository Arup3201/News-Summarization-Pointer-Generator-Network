Apple fans enjoy watching Frozen and buy their clothes from Hollister, while Samsung owners prefer Police Academy and Ellie Goulding, according to a new online profiler.  

London-based YouGov collected data from 190,000 UK members over 120,000 data points including where people bank, what cars they drive and what they like to eat.

The free web app lets people search for information about people who own different phones, eat different foods, shop in various supermarkets and live in certain areas, among other data.

London-based YouGov collected data from 190,000 UK members over 120,000 data points. The free web app (above) lets people search for information about people who own different phones, eat different foods, shop in various supermarkets and live in certain areas, among other data

The app does not show the typical fan or customer, because as YouGov explained: ‘If it did, most groups would look very similar, and you wouldn't learn a lot about the specifics of particular thing.’

Instead, it shows what is particularly true about a group. YouGov compares the group to their natural 'comparison set'.

For example, it compares fans of Downton Abbey to anyone who has rated any TV shows, and detemines which of the thousands of datapoints most 'overscore' in the target group.

If something is only true of 1 per cent of the overall population, but is true of 6 per cent of YouGov’s target group, it might score very highly, but this doesn't mean it is true of all of them.

Another example that YouGov gives is if many of the football teams show a female character, it doesn’t mean that most of the fans are female, but simply that compared to other football teams, there are more female fans than you would expect.

The YouGov panel only includes adults of 18 years or older, and if the sample shows 52 people, YouGov explained that it doesn’t mean they only surveyed 52 people.

Instead, it means that, of the tens of thousands of people who took part, 52 have identified themselves as fans or customers of that particular brand of item.

According to the profiler, Apple fans love to eat grilled halloumi, and nachos and they most likely own a pet fish. They are shown as female, aged between 25 and 39 and living in London. They’re most likely to work in media and publishing and don’t have a strong political preference

Apple fans would also describe themselves as confident and funny, but also control freaks and insecure. When it comes to brands, they shop in Waitrose and Hollister, bank with First Direct and own a BMW 

MailOnline looked into the profiles of people who identify themselves as Apple, Samsung, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone fans.

Sample sizes varied from 10,806 Apple customers, 9,648 Samsung fans, 105 Android customers, 1,255 Blackberry owners and 853 people with a Windows Phone device.
