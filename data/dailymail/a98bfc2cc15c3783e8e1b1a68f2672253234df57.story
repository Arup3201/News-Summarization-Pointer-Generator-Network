Authorities are overreaching with a murder charge against an Alabama father accused in the slaying of his daughter's sexual abuser, his defense attorney said Wednesday.

Tommy Drake, who represents the 41-year-old man, said there's no way evidence would support a murder charge because the shooting happened 'in the heat of passion.'

'Even if you believe the facts asserted by the authorities the most it would be is ... manslaughter,' said Drake.

Shot dead: Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, who was convicted of molesting a 7-year-old girl in 2002, was gunned down at his parents' home

Fit of rage: This is the 41-year-old father who is charged with murder for killing the registered sex offender who molested his daughter

Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, was shot to death at his home near Cullman on Sunday. Brooks pleaded guilty to sexually abusing the accused shooter's daughter in 2002 when she was in elementary school.

The Associated Press doesn't identify victims in sex crimes, and it isn't naming the suspect to protect the daughter's identity.

'We are investigating all aspects of this case and cannot comment on a motive at this point,' Cullman County sheriff Mike Rainey said in a press release. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the victimâ€™s family.'

Drake described his client as a construction worker with no previous felony convictions and a solid work history. With the man's bond set at $156,000, Drake said he would request a reduction and a hearing could be held as early as Thursday.

'There's no way someone in his position can meet a bond like that,' said Drake.

Supporters have created a website to help pay the man's legal expenses, and $625 had been donated by Wednesday. That's far short of the amount needed to pay the bond, at least $75,000 on which authorities said must be in cash, and the man also will face legal fees.

A Facebook site created to show support for the man had more than 950 members within hours of its creation, and donors gave more donations on another website to help fund his legal defense. Jason Lackey, a longtime friend of the alleged shooter, contributed $150.

'The guy was guilty of raping his little girl, and I guess he dealt with it for 12 years and it just built up,' said Lackey, who has a recreational vehicle business in Cullman. 'I won't say (he) had the right to go murder him, but I understand when he did.'

'It would be unbelievable to hold animosity in your heart for 12 years,' said Brooks' father Ralph Brooks. He also said his son had been living a Godly life since prison and did not deserve to die

Meanwhile, the father also is charged with opening fire on a stepdaughter's boyfriend outside a convenience store moments before the slaying.

Sheriff's officials have said the man first opened fire on a stepdaughter's boyfriend outside a store and missed. Then, they said, he rode his motorcycle to Brooks' house less than a mile away and killed Brooks, who served 27 months of a five-year sentence after pleading guilty to sexually abusing the man's daughter.

Mike Hays, who cooks and operates a small barbecue restaurant inside Berlin Plaza Quick Stop, where the shooting occurred, said he came face-to-face with the shooter after the man opened fire outside and then entered the store looking for his intended victim, who wasn't hurt.

'People here are calling him a hero for killing a child molester. I'm calling him a psychopathic lunatic for endangering peoples' lives, including mine,' Hays said.

'People here are calling him a hero for killing a child molester. I'm calling him a psychopathic lunatic for endangering peoples' lives, including mine,' said Mike Hays, who came face-to-face with the shooter

After stopping his motorcycle at an intersection outside the store, the father fired once at a man who was standing beside an ice cooler, Hays said. The bullet entered an exterior wall of the store and chipped a window but no one was injured.

Hays said he retrieved his own weapon and confronted the gunman near the cash register.

'He had the gun down by his side. He was calm, as calm as you are standing there now. But he had that look in his eye,' said Hays. 'I have no problem with him shooting a child molester, just not 12 years later. If it was my daughter he would have died back in 2002.'

Brooks' father, Ralph Brooks, told WBRC-TV in Birmingham that his son did not deserve to die. He said Raymond Earl Brooks turned his life around after his conviction and lived a godly life that included being active in his church. Because his son's conviction happened so long ago, he said he couldn't be sure if the shooting was a form of revenge.

'It would be unbelievable to hold animosity in your heart for 12 years,' Brooks said.

A person who answered the door at the Brooks' home Tuesday told an Associated Press reporter the family was making funeral arrangements and was not available to comment immediately.

Lackey said he was told by a relative that the shootings followed a family argument over the stepdaughter's boyfriend that grew heated enough to include a reference to the sexual abuse case from years before.

'I'm 100 per cent behind him,' Lackey said.

Chief Deputy Mac Barlett said the father did make a statement to deputies after he was arrested Sunday night, but Barlett said he could not comment on what the man had said.

The father and Brooks 'obviously didn't have a whole lot of good blood between them,' but it was unknown whether the shooting was directly linked to the sex abuse case, Bartlett said.

'It is odd. He apparently had a lot of stressors going on in his life,' Bartlett said.

The suspect's father told MailOnline he has no idea why he might have waited 13 years to attack Brooks.
