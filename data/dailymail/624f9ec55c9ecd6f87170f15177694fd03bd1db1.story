These students seem to taken their right to bare arms a little too literally.

Clutching their favouite weapons, the pupils from the High School of Civil Defence in Uhersky Brod, in the Czech Republic, pose naked for their graduation snaps.

But their proud parents could be forgiven for feeling a little reluctant to display these snaps on the mantlepiece.

And the MailOnline has spared two of the students' blushes with a careful piece of censorship after they left a little too much on show.

The 28 graduates stripped off to show off their weapons out of pride for their studies and their military school's traditional roots.

Stanislaw Mach said: 'We studied guns and wanted to show our respect for them by placing our favourite weapons alongside our other favourite thing.'

A school spokesman said: 'We don't have a problem with this, the class teacher of course decided to keep her clothes on but for the young men it was all harmless fun.'

In the Czech republic there are 
certain schools and Universities that operate alongside mainstream 
educational institutions where candidates are also prepared for service 
in the officer corps of the army, the navy, air force or coast guard.

They
normally provide education in a service environment and include high 
schools awarding academic qualifications, university institutions and 
those preparing officer cadets for commissioning into the armed services
of the state.

Lock, stock and barrel: The students clasped their favouite guns in their naked graduation pictures
