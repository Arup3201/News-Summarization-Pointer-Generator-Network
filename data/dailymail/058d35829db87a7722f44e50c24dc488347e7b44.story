A mother of five forced to register as a sex offender after being convicted of sexual contact with her daughter’s 14-year-old ex-boyfriend is willing to risk arrest to attend her daughter’s graduation.

Linda Lusk, 52, the former mayor of Prosser, WA., is barred by the town school district from attending any events involving other children. She is vowing to be in attendance for her daughter’s graduation next spring even if it means she will be arrested for trespassing.

Ms Lusk agreed to a plea deal that did not force her to admit guilt – she has maintained her innocence from day one – served two months in jail and two years probation, which ended last year.

‘There is no way that they're going to keep me.’ Ms Lusk told ABC News, ‘I mean, even if I get arrested, I am going to my daughter’s graduation.’

Bubba Frank was 14-years-old when he told friends Ms Lusk gave him oral sex, he never went to the police, according to ABC News. 

Ms Lusk was eventually charged with third degree child molestation, and even admitted to inadvertently grazing Mr Frank’s penis with her hand, but denied molesting the young boy.

With her probation over, Ms Lusk is no longer barred from any events involving children besides her own, but Prosser school officials have refused requests she has made to attend school events.

Kevin Lusk, Ms Lusk’s now-former husband, was the school principal, according to ABC. He publicly defended her, but later filed for divorce, which was finalized last year.

When her son’s baseball team made the playoffs, Ms Lusk wrote asking for permission to attend his games.

‘If baseball games are at other school districts, we have no trespass authority,’ Prosser Schools Superintendent Ray Tolcacher responded, according to ABC. ‘At Prosser, request is denied.

The district hasn’t yet decided whether Ms Lusk will be allowed to attend the graduation, officials told ABC.

‘It's not fair,’ daughter Karlie told ABC. ‘It's a lot of restricting and, like, unnecessary things.’

The divorced handbag shop owner has even been denied attendance to parent-teacher conferences.

‘The fact that I've been denied access to their parent-teacher conferences gives me grave concern that they're going to deny my access to graduation,’ she told ABC.

Now living with a boyfriend, Ms Lusk still blames the entire incident on a 14-year-old boy.

‘I feel very bad for what happened. I don’t think he’s ever accepted responsibility for what he did,’ she told ABC.

Adam Canary, her new boyfriend, was only 28 when they met. He reached out to her after seeing a story on the accused pedophile in 2011, according to ABC.
