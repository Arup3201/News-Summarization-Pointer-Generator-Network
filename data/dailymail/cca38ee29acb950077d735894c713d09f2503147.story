Swetlana Maslowskaya, 32, has been jailed for two and a half years over 1 million Euro tax fraud

German tax officials continued their clampdown on high-profile tax fraudsters this week with a court in Frankfurt ordering a former Playboy playmate of the year to be jailed for two and a half years over 1 million Euro tax fraud.

Swetlana Maslowskaya, 32, dressed in a black suit and striped shirt, burst into tears on Wednesday when she was told that she would spend a year in jail before any chance of release.

The decision to jail Maslowskaya, who was playmate of the year in 2002, came after it was discovered that she had accepted at least $2.5 million gifts from her 90-year-old lover, the German brewery heir Bruno Schubert.

This included cash sums but also cars, jewellery, exotic holidays, shopping sprees and an apartment in Salzburg which she later sold without paying tax.

Maslowskaya gave up her modelling 
career when she became the girlfriend of Schubert.

The Playmate met the married beer tycoon in 2004, according to Bild.

The model reportedly said at the time: 'He wanted to have me immediately.'

Schubert, who sold the family's famous Henninger brewery in the 1980s, married Meharit Kifle, a woman of Ethiopian origin 64 years his junior in August 2009.

The wedding took place five months after the death of Ingeborg, his first wife of 68 years.

The multimillionaire philanthropist died aged 90 in October 2010, leading to a legal dispute among family after he changed his will and left his fortune to Ms Kifle.

The family accused Ms Kifle of not taking care of the elderly tycoon properly in the lead up to this death.

Maslowskaya's lawyer Eckart Hild appealed for a suspended sentence in court this week. The retired model told the court in tears: 'I am really sorry for what I did. I will never accept any gifts ever again.'

The
 former Playmodel's conviction is not a good sign for the Bayern Munich 
president, Uli Hoeness, who also admitted at a tax trial this week that 
he hid millions of euros more than authorities thought.

His
 defence lawyer Hanns Feigen said that Hoeness cheated the taxman out of
 $18.5million (Â£15.4million) - $15million more than the $3.5million 
listed by the prosecution.

Hoeness
 told the Munich court that he stashed away the money in a secret Swiss 
bank account during years of obsessive stock 'gambling'.

'I
 am glad that everything is now transparent and on the table,' the 
62-year-old, who now faces a possible jail term, said on the first day 
of his trial.

But the 
jailing of Maslowskaya for a considerably lower sum makes the likelihood
 of the football chief avoiding jail even more unrealistic.
