Adrian Callen has been ordered to repay almost £30,000 of the money he fraudulently claimed

A landlord who fraudulently claimed over £73,000 in benefits despite owning ten properties has been ordered to pay back nearly £30,000 today.

Adrian Callen, 57, claimed he had no income other than benefits and had just £250 in savings.

But the grandfather was actually raking in thousands of pounds in rent from ten flats he had bought - worth around £100,000 each.

He renovated the properties and used rent to pay for huge mortgages he had taken out on them during the eight-year scam.

He
lied to Bristol City Council and the Department of Work and Pensions to
claim £59,886 income support, £8,923 council tax allowance and £4,882 
in job seekers allowance over eight years.

By the time he was caught in 2011 he owned and rented out numerous properties in Weston-super-Mare, Bristol and Cardiff.

He
repeatedly fraudulently filled in forms, lied in interview and failed 
to update changes in his circumstances and eventually pleaded guilty to 
nine counts of fraud.

He was jailed for six months in November.

He returned to court today for a Proceeds of Crime Application (POCA) to claw some of the money he illegally claimed.

It was agreed Callen's criminal benefit was actually £68,673 and his available assets of £29,542.92 were confiscated.

Callen,
whose main asset was the home where he lives with his son, was given 
six months to pay or face eight months' prison in default.

Timothy Rose, defending, said Callen had been forced to stop working so he could care for his four-year-old grandchild.

Callen had a large property portfolio, including a flat in this block, and owned properties in Cardiff and Bristol

Callen, who owned ten properties,  was caught out when one of his tenants applied for benefits

'He invested in property but didn't make much money out of it,' Mr Rose said.

He was caught in 2011 when one of his tenants applied for benefits and officials launched an investigation into the landlord's own finances

When he was jailed for six months, Judge Julian Lambert called Callen a 'greedy' cheat.

He said: 'You had a gross worth of hundreds of thousands of pounds.

'What you did was deliberate and greedy. Yours was one of the worst types of this fraud. This behaviour makes honest folk who struggle to get by feel sick.'
