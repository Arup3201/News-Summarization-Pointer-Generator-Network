Player of the Year: Luis Suarez (Liverpool).Young Player of the Year: Eden Hazard (Chelsea).Women's Player of the Year: Lucy Bronze (Liverpool Ladies).Women's Young Player of the Year: Martha Harris (Liverpool Ladies).

Luis Suarez was named PFA Player of the Year on Sunday night in recognition of his astonishing 30 Premier League goals this season, which have helped catapult Liverpool into the title race.

The award caps a remarkable turnaround for the striker, who was banned for 10 games at the end of the last campaign after biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.

However, having missed the first six matches of this season, Suarez returned to the Liverpool side at the end of September and formed an incredible partnership with Daniel Sturridge - the pair have hit 50 Premier League goals so far.

Upset: The Uruguayan didn't have the best of times against Jose Mourinho's Chelsea on Sunday afternoon

Suarez, who played as Liverpool lost 2-0 to Chelsea at Anfield hours before the ceremony, said: 'The Premier League is full of really 
great players and so it is a great honour when these players recognise 
your work on the pitch.

'I always try my best for the team and it is nice
 to get awards but really this is for my team-mates and the staff at Liverpool because without their help I wouldn't have this prize.'

Chelsea forward Eden Hazard, who scooped 
the Young Player of the Year award, came second in the main vote, 
while Manchester City talisman Yaya Toure came third.

Suarez,
 who becomes the first Liverpool player to win the award since Steven 
Gerrard in 2006, was the overwhelming 
favourite for the top award.

The Uruguayan has put behind him a troublesome year which saw him agitating 
for a move in the summer, even at one stage claiming manager Brendan 
Rodgers had reneged on a deal to allow him to leave for a Champions 
League club.

Rodgers' handling of the situation has been impressive but the Liverpool boss insisted all of the credit should be with the player.

'He
 is a brilliant talent. I think the supporters have seen him mature over
 the course of the last season,' Rodgers said of Suarez on Friday.

'I
 think he was in a real low moment after that game (against Chelsea last
 year) but he has gone away and probably looked in the mirror and 
reflected on himself because he is not that type of guy and it probably 
just spilled over.

'He is a really intelligent man who fits the values of this club, which is all about humility, class and he has all of that.

'He
 is a sheer winner and that probably overspilled last year but his 
development over the last year has been remarkable both on and off the 
field and Liverpool have benefited from that.

'For me he is the consistently outstanding player over the course of the last year.'

Close: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, whose mistake proved costly against Chelsea, was on the shortlist

Knows where the net is: Daniel Sturridge has scored 20 goals for Brendan Rodgers' side this year

Suarez,
 who has terrorised Premier League defences all season, topped a six-man
 shortlist which also included his strike partner Sturridge, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, Toure, Hazard and Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana.

Rather amusingly, Suarez walked into the room during comedian Kevin Bridge's set before the award was announced. The funnyman appeared to let Suarez off though, joking: 'Are you confident Luis?'

All six nominees were named in the PFA's Premier League Team of the 
year, alongside Chelsea pair Petr Cech and Gary Cahill, Manchester City captain
 Vincent Kompany and full backs Seamus Coleman and Luke Shaw of Everton
 and Southampton respectively.

However,
 having seen four players named in last year's selection, not one 
Manchester United star made this year's XI following a disastrous 
campaign which saw manager David Moyes lose his job last week. It's the first time a United player has failed to make the Team of the Year since 1990.

Meanwhile, Liverpool had more reason to celebrate as defender Lucy Bronze won the Women's Player of the Year prize while team-mate Martha Harris scooped the Young Player award.
