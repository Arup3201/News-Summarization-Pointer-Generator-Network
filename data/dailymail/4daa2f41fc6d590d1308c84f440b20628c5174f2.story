Anger: Steve Jobs went on the rant in his authorised biography, pictured, and pledged to destroy Android using all the money Apple had

Steve Jobs pledged to use his 'last dying breath' destroying rival Google's Android because he believed it was based on stolen iPhone technology.

Revealed in an advanced copy of the Apple co-founder's authorised biography, he branded it 'grand theft Android' and promised to spend all his company's money to wreck them.

Mr Jobs, who died earlier this month, vowed 'thermonuclear war' and said that he would not accept any compensation because all he wanted was the company ruined.

Apple has embarked on a war against Android, suing companies who have adopted the software for their phones or tablets.

'I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every 
penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,' he said.

'I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.'

The rant in the book provides insight into the unravelling of Jobs' relationship with Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google and an Apple board member from 2006 to 2009.

Mr Schmidt had quit Apple's board as Google and Apple went head-to-head on smartphones, Apple with its iPhone and Google with its Android software.

Rivals: Apple have sued companies who have released smartphones using Android software, like HTC, right, because they say it too similar to the operating system used by an iPhone

Jobs was livid in January 2010 when HTC introduced an Android phone that boasted many of the popular features of the iPhone.

Apple sued, and Jobs went on an expletive-filled rant at Google's actions.

In a subsequent meeting with Schmidt at a Palo Alto cafe, Jobs told Schmidt that he wasn't interested in settling the lawsuit, the book says.

'I don't want your money. If you offer me $5 billion, I won't want it. I've got plenty of money. I want you to stop using our ideas in Android, that's all I want.'
