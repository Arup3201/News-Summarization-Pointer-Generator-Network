Emmanuel Adebayor might not be attracting much attention on the pitch but the out-of-favour Tottenham striker was sure to be turning heads when he turned up for training.

The Togo forward arrived in style when he drove a £360,000 Rolls-Royce to the club's Enfield base as the team began preparations for the second leg of their Europa League tie with Fiorentina on Thursday night.

Adebayor posted a picture to his official Instagram page of him standing next to the Phantom Drophead Coupe model on Monday before setting off for training.

Price: £360,000

Top speed: 150mph

0-60mph: 5.6 sec

Bhp: 453

Engine: 6.75-litre V12

Weight: 2,705 kg 

'This morning's ride to training, travel in style and ready to work! Have a good week guys,' Adebayor wrote on Instagram.

The former Monaco, Arsenal and Manchester City frontman later posted another picture after training had finished of him sat in the back of the car as he showed his friend around London.

Adebayor has only started once for Spurs - in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg against Sheffield United - since November and has not even been named as a substitute since the club failed to offload him in the January transfer window. 

The 30-year-old was keen to move to West Ham on loan for the rest of the season but the transfer was blocked by chairman Daniel Levy.

Adebayor began the season as Spurs' first-choice striker but has now fallen behind Harry Kane and Roberto Soldado in the pecking order.

But the striker could be called upon in the coming games with Tottenham enduring a busy schedule over the next fortnight.

Mauricio Pochettino's side are bidding to reach the last 16 of the Europa League, claim the first silverware of the season when they face Chelsea in the Capital one Cup final on Sunday and remain in the hunt for a top-four finish.
