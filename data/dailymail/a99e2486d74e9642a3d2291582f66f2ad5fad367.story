At 10 months old, Jacob Davis gave his big sister the ultimate gift - life.

The baby boy donated his bone marrow to help save the life of his dying sibling Seren-Rose.

The two-year-old was born with an extremely rare life-limiting disease, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), which delayed her development and caused her to slowly deteriorate.

Her parents Elouise and Simon Davis from Colchester in Essex were told the only hope to save their daughter was a bone marrow transplant.

It was then they discovered their son Jacob, now one, was the perfect match for his sister.

And after a sucessful transplant, the 10-month-old is back at home with his older sibling having saved her young life.

Mrs Davis, 26, said: 'I am so proud of Jacob and I cannot wait for the day when Seren will understand what he has done for her.

'Jacob was so small when we first considered the bone marrow transplant but we knew he would be just fine.

'I knew it was a risk but it was definitely one worth taking. Without the transplant there was only one path that Seren was going to go down.

'Now Seren has got a better future ahead of her, it is just amazing.

'Jacob was just eight months old when we were told he was a perfect match for Seren.

'We were assured the procedure for him was fairly straightforward, and the risk minimal.

'A sibling donor would give Seren the very best chance of a successful transplant.

'I am so proud of the two of them.'

When Mrs Davis found out that a bone marrow transplant was the only option at saving her daughter, she knew she had to let Jacob save her.

She said: 'Jacob was just six months at the time but he had been hitting all of his milestones.

'He was very healthy and we knew he would bounce right back.

Tests revealed Jacob, who was eight months old at the time, was a perfect match. Mrs Davis, said: 'People sometimes think he has been born to save his sister but that wasn't the case at all. He just had the chance to'

'I did a lot of research into the risks for Jacob because my main concern was his safety, but the risks for him were minimal.

'People sometimes think he has been born to save his sister but that wasn’t the case at all. He just had the chance to.

'Now he is going to grow up feeling very proud of himself and I am never going to let him forget it.'

Seren-Rose was diagnosed with MPS in December 2013 - a condition which means her body fails to produce a certain enzyme, affecting the development of her whole body, including her vision and brain function.

But doctors explained that a bone marrow transplant could stop the disease in its tracks.

Mrs Davis said: 'Me and my husband were tested to see if we could give our bone marrow but we weren’t matches so they tested Jacob who was six months at the time.

'Jacob was a perfect match for his sister. It was a complete shock - I saw it as an absolute miracle.

'I did a lot of research into the risks for Jacob.

'Jacob would be tender for a few days but he would then be completely back to normal.

'I wasn’t concerned at all. I knew it was better for Jacob to grow up with his sister than to simply be shown photos and told what she was like.

'Seren-Rose was only going to get worse without the transplant.

'After her diagnosis I carried out a lot of research on her condition and I knew she was only going one way.

Mrs Davis, said she fully researched what donating his bone marrow would mean for her son. She said: 'I wasn't concerned at all. I knew it was better for Jacob to grow up with his sister than to simply be shown photos and told what she was like'

Mucopolysaccharide and related Lysomal Storage Diseases affect one in every 25,000 live births.

One baby born every eight days will be diagnosed with an MPS or related disease. 

These multi-organ storage diseases cause progressive physical disability and, in many cases, severe degenerative mental deterioration resulting in death in childhood.

They are rare, life-limiting, genetic conditions caused by the shortage of a particular enzyme.

It means the body cannot break down certain molecules that are integral to connective tissues including cartilage and tendons.

The condition causes progressive physical disability and in many cases, severe neurological deterioration and can result in death in childhood.

Babies may show no sign of the disease but as more and more cells become damaged, symptoms begin to appear.

Over time the diseases tend to affect many of the major organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys as well as the bones, eyes and skin.

MPS and related diseases are inherited conditions.

If both parents are carriers, a baby has a one in four chance of having MPS.

Although there is no cure stem cell transplants and enzyme replacement therapy can help treat specific types of MPS.

'She would be okay until she was about three, but then she would stop learning and developing and just go backwards.

'She would just get progressively worse from three years old until she died.

'The transplant could not repair the damage the disease has already done to her body, but it can stop it from making her worse.

'We were told about all the risks for Seren with having a bone marrow transplant but we knew there was no debating it.

'There was an 85 per cent chance of success, five per cent chance of rejection and a 10 per cent chance of fatality.

'They weren’t the best odds but were a risk worth taking.'

On May 9, the entire family travelled to Great Ormand Street for the transplant.

The 26-year-old said: 'I never believed it was going to happen until the day.

'Jacob came in to the hospital in the morning and he was out from the procedure in no time.

'When he came out of theatre I was amazed to see him playing, it went so smoothly.

'We had to wait for a few hours after Jacob’s cells were taken, but when they gave his cells to Seren, we had Jacob in the room with us.

She said: 'It was great that Jacob was back on his feet straight away, and Seren did amazingly well throughout the process.

'She did nearly end up in intensive 
care when she had excess fluid on her lungs and struggled to breathe, 
but the doctors were fantastic and managed to get her back on track.

Jacob and Seren were admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital where doctors carried out the transplant

'She was amazing, she was in high spirits throughout the whole transplant.'

Seren went from strength to strength as her body accepted Jacob’s cells.

'Six weeks after the transplant we were told we would probably be going home the next week,' Mrs Davis said.

'I didn’t want to get my hopes up so I didn’t let myself get excited.

'He is going to grow up feeling very proud of himself, and I am never going to let him forget it'

'But the next week on the Friday, they told us we were definitely going home that day.

'It took me a good couple of hours to pack but I was over the moon.

'The next day was Jacob’s first birthday so it was just perfect timing.'

Mrs Davis is ecstatic to be back at home with Seren and Jacob together.

'Jacob is totally obsessed with her he is so excited to have her home he follows her around everywhere,' she said. 'I am really proud of the two of them.

'I won’t ever let him forget what he has done for her.'

Seren is recovering well from the transplant and is already getting back on her feet.

Her
 mother, said: 'For the first few weeks Seren didn’t really want to do 
anything because of the steroids she was on but it was just unbelievable
 having her home.

The siblings are now back at home in Colchester in Essex after the transplant was a success. Doctors have told Mr and Mrs Davis the operation will not reverse the damage already caused by the disease but it will stop the illness in its tracks

'Now we have been home for a month she is completely off the steroids and she is back to her normal self playing a lot with her brother.

'Seren has a future now and although she still has to live with the damages already caused by the disease, she has a completely different life direction.

'I’ve always thought special needs children go to special families and I wouldn’t change Seren for the world.

'I will be really proud of anything she achieves and I will always be proud of Jacob for saving her life.

'I feel like the luckiest mother around.'
