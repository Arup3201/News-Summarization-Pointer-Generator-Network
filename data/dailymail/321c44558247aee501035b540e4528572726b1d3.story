Barrister Robert Francis said he is concerned the nursing profession is not doing enough to raise standards

Nurses are not doing enough to ensure patients do not suffer callous treatment or appalling neglect, an expert has warned.

Robert Francis, a barrister who specialises in medical negligence, said he was concerned the profession was failing to make urgent improvements.

Earlier this year Mr Francis led an inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal in which as many as 1,200 patients are feared to have died from neglect.

He made a number of urgent recommendations for the health service about how to improve care – to ensure the tragedy could not be repeated at other hospitals.

But Mr Francis said that while doctors and managers were taking action, he had ‘little cause for optimism’ that nurses were doing the same.

The inquiry’s findings, published in March, described how patients at Mid Staffordshire had been left ‘unwashed, unfed and without fluids’ and ‘deprived of their dignity’.

But it concluded that such failings were not a ‘rare event’ and almost certainly existed at other hospitals across the country.

Mr Francis issued the NHS with 290 recommendations.

In an interview with Nursing Times and Health Service Journal he said that, overall, his recommendations had been ‘well received by all the professions in general terms.’

Referring to doctors and managers he said: ‘They are taking this very seriously. The royal colleges [which represent doctors] are taking action.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has accused the Royal College of Nursing of failing to notice the scandal unfolding

‘Putting it bluntly I have seen rather 
less of that from the nursing profession … There is a need to strengthen
the voice of nursing so that what nurses need in their workplace, to do
their job effectively for patients, is articulated better and 
stronger.’

Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt accused the profession’s main union, the Royal College of Nursing, of failing to notice the Mid Staffordshire scandal unfolding.

A spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing said it would issue a 'detailed and comprehensive' response to the Mid Staffordshire report.

They added: ‘We take the findings extremely seriously, not only in terms of how they will impact on the nursing profession as a whole, but also as an organisation that seeks to represent the interests of nursing staff and their patients,' the RCN said in a statement.’

Age UK figures show the NHS has spent £260million caring for these patients on wards since the Coalition came to power.
