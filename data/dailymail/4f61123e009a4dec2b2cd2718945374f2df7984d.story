Harry Redknapp is adamant that Eduardo Vargas can fire the goals to guide QPR to Premier League safety.

Chile striker Vargas twice thought he had rescued a point for Rangers in Sunday's clash with Liverpool, only for Steven Caulker's own goal to hand the Reds a 3-2 victory.

Rangers boss Redknapp admitted he will be hard pressed to leave Napoli loan recruit Vargas out of his starting line-up after his two-goal cameo at Loftus Road.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp is adamant that Vargas' goals can keep his team in the Premier League 

'I've got no doubts we'll be okay and that we'll stay up,' said Redknapp, despite QPR remaining rooted to the bottom of the Premier League.

'And the little boy Vargas has given me even more confidence.

'To see him come on and get two goals, when he got two for Chile as well in midweek: he's a goalscorer.

'And he nearly scored another at the end with Skrtel, when he was coming in to dive in and head it.

'He'll score goals and he's going to be a big asset for us. It's going to be difficult to leave him out of the team.'
