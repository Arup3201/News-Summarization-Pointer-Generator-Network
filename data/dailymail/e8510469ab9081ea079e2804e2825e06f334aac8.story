West Ham midfielder Stewart Downing is still hopeful of an England recall, but the winger believes he will have to wait until current manager Roy Hodgson has departed for that to happen. 

Downing won the last of his 34 caps in a 1-0 win against Norway in May 2012, Hodgson's first game as England coach, and was also a non-playing part of Hodgson's Euro 2012 squad. 

But Downing told the London Evening Standard he does not expect the former Fulham manager to pick him again.

Roy Hodgson celebrates England's win over Switzerland earlier this month and has ignored Downing 

He said: 'I'd never say my England career was over but, if I am realistic, I don't think I will get a chance while Roy Hodgson is in charge.

'The only thing I can do is keep playing well and if injuries happen, you never know, he might change his mind.

'If he doesn't pick me that's fair enough, it's his opinion. He did pick me for the Euros but didn't play me and after that I didn't get selected again. He hadn't really seen me but maybe I didn't fit into his systems or he wanted to go for younger players - I honestly don't know.

'I'm still only 30 and maybe if I don't get an opportunity under this England coach, it could still happen further down the line. It's not only me. I thought Mark Noble would have been in the last England squad. With respect to Fabian Delph, Mark has played consistently well in the Premier League for a number of years.

'James Tomkins is another one who would maybe be disappointed not to have been called up but, like Mark, he's young enough to get his chance one day, if he keeps playing well.'

Downing has begun this season brightly, scoring in a 3-1 win over Crystal Palace before the Hammers were beaten 3-1 at home  by Southampton.

Sam Allardyce's team take on Hull City at the KC Stadium on Monday, and Ecuador striker Enner Valencia, a £12million summer signing, is expected to make his first Premier League start, while Alex Song is set to make his debut following his  loan move from Barcelona.

Downing was pleased with West Ham's summer signings, but knows his side are in for a tough match against Hull.

He added: 'The transfer window was good for us. We have good competition in all places now whereas for large parts of last season the team was basically picking itself.

'The pleasing thing now, although it might be a headache for the manager, is picking the team. He has options in all positions now but I'm sure he would rather have it this way than having to play people out of position, as he was forced to do last season.

'The players, particularly the strikers who have come in, are different to what we've had in the past though and I believe that the team, as a result, has to change the way we play.

'Hull will be a tough game though. They've bought well and Steve Bruce is a good manager.'
