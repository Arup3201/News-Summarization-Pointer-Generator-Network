Tucked away in the north-eastern corner of China live the Uighur people, a Muslim group who live a way of life that's different in almost every way from that of the majority Han Chinese.

And life hasn't always been easy for the Uighur. Persecuted by the Communists following a failed bid for independence and accused of terrorism by the rulers of modern China, the Uighurs are hard to access, hidden away from visiting tourists and despised by many of the Han.

Now French photographer Eric Lafforgue has shed light on the fascinating world of the Uighurs after travelling to Xinjiang, the sprawling semi-autonomous region that they call home, and revealed how the Uighurs are using traditional garments as a means of silent defiance.

Defiance: This elderly woman, photographed in the city of Kyria, is wearing a banned Taipak - the world's smallest hat - on top of her equally illegal veil

Outlawed: Women who wear traditional veils such as this one cannot enter petrol stations, banks or hospitals and are also barred from taking government jobs

Persecution: Men who grow beards are barred from government roles. Recently Beijing introduced laws that forbid lawyers - and their families - from wearing them

Colourful: An elderly man photographed in the market at Kyria and a Tajik Uighur woman who has travelled across the border to shop sporting traditional garments

There he found people struggling to survive and dealing with endemic discrimination that includes being barred from many jobs and having their homes demolished on spurious grounds.

'The government claims it’s demolishing the houses due to seismic issues,' says Lafforgue. But the Uighurs tell a different story. 'One told me that it's not just the homes that are being demolished but their souls,' he continues. 

Although Muslims, the Chinese government discourages the wearing of Islamic headscarves and women are not allowed into petrol stations and other shops if they are wearing one.

'In gas stations, women must remove their veils is they want to be served,' explains Lafforgue. 'The same applies in hospitals, administrations, banks and so on. The Hans see veils as linked with terrorism. But in reality, the majority of Uighur women still wear veils.'

Elegant: There are Uighur populations in most of the surrounding countries including Tajikistan, where these women come from, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan

Tradition: This young Uighur woman shows off her pencilled brows, joined together by a line of black ink. Single brows are considered beautiful by the Uighurs

Happy family: The Uighur, in a rare concession, are exempt from the One Child rule and are allowed two children in cities and up to four children in the countryside

Jealous: According to Lafforgue, the exemption has made the Han angry, with the result that many Uighur families struggle to support themselves and are very poor

The Chinese government also takes a similar approach to traditional Islamic beards, an initiative that sparked riots as recently as June. 'The measure was introduced during the 2008 Ramadan, but wasn’t respected,' adds Lafforgue. 'Nevertheless, government workers cannot have beards or mustaches.'

But despite the simmering tension between the Uighur and their Han neighbours, their culture continues to flourish, not least in neighbouring Central Asian countries, including Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

And despite the Chinese government's efforts to prevent it, the Chinese Uighurs cling to their traditions, including the wearing of the Taipak - the world's smallest hat.

'In Kyria, I photographed a woman with a Talpak hat, which is a sign that the woman is married,' explains Lafforgue. 'The antiterrorism law forbids them from wearing it, except for funerals. Wearing it is a sign of defiance.'

Defiant though they might be, with news yesterday of yet another Chinese government crackdown on 'illegal religious activities', the Uighurs fight for recognition and respect within China looks set to continue.

Community: The Chinese government discourages visitors to the Uighurs home region and accuses the people of being separatist terrorists

Playtime: A small boy plays with his beaker, perched precariously on a tray of fruit being sold at the Kyria market by his colourfully dressed mother

Celebration: This Uighur marriage photographed by Lafforgue had been sealed off in an alley by Chinese authorities in an attempt to conceal it from tourists

Childhood: Uighur children also live a traditional lifestyle, and play with traditional wooden swords, or in this little girl's case (above) the tomb of ruler Sultan Sayidan

The origins of the Uighur tribe lie deep in the Altay mountains of Mongolia - or in Turkemenistan, depending on which version of the story you believe.

According to the Uighurs themselves, their origins are Turkic and date back more than 5,000 years. By contrast, the Chinese say the Uighurs are descendents of the Tiele tribes of Mongolia, who by 842, had coalesced into the Uighur people and moved en masse to the Tarim Basin in what is now modern China.

Either way, the debate around the origins of the Uighurs is yet another skirmish in the ongoing battle between the majority-Muslim tribe and the Han Chinese for centuries.

Mainly tolerated during the long rule of the Chinese emperors, the real problems for the Uighurs began after the Communists swept to power in 1949. After a failed bid for independence, the Chinese cracked down on the fledgling state and the Xinjiang region which they call home is treated as a semi-autonomous state run along similar lines to Tibet.

Activists accuse the Chinese government of steadily eroding the Uighurs' freedoms, among them curtailing religious, commercial and cultural activities.

Beijing has also been accused of seeking to dilute Uighur influence by arranging the mass immigration of Han Chinese, the country's majority ethnic group, to Xinjiang, with the result that the Uighurs have become a minority in their homeland.

According to China, their activities are justified because of the terrorist threat posed by Uighur separatists. The Uighur themselves dispute this claim.

Rainbow: Like their parents, Uighur children sport brightly patterned garments including elaborately beaded and embellished hats

Han influence: The route into the Uighur city of Kashgar takes you past a square dominated by a statue of Chairman Mao

Hazard: Many of the Uighur believe the Han deliberately spike their food with pork so will only eat at cafes and restaurants belonging to trusted friends
