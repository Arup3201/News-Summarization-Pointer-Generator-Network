A luxury car customiser has unveiled a Bentley covered in snakeskin in time to celebrate 2013 as the Chinese Year of the Snake.

Latvia-based company Dartz Motorz has revealed its Bentley SS early because of the time it takes to prepare.

The SS stands for snake skin and is added to the Bentley GT range.

For people worried about animal welfare issues, the car can be ordered with a vinyl fake snakeskin finish.

But for those who want the real thing, only snakes bred on farms for the leather industry are used.

Cost for the covering starts from $12,000 (£8,000), while the Bentley GT itself will set you back at more than $200,000 (£125,000).
