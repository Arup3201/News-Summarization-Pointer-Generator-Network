Homebuyers' confidence in the housing market is at its lowest since April 2011 after being dented by soaring prices and fears over higher interest rates, a report shows today.

The proportion of people who believe now is ‘a good time to buy’ has fallen to its lowest level for at least three years, according to mortgage lender Halifax.

More than a third of people asked, or 35 per cent, said rising house prices were a barrier to buying, up from just 20 per cent a year ago.

Barriers: Soaring house prices are putting people off making offers on houses, a Halifax survey found

Nearly one in five, or 18 per cent, said they were worried about rises in interest rates, up from 13 per cent a year ago.

But raising a deposit remains the biggest barrier to buying, with 55 per cent citing it as a major hurdle.

Experts said confidence in the housing market had reached ‘a tipping point’.

The Halifax Housing Market Confidence tracker found that 47 per cent of people thought it was a good time to buy, while 42 per cent believed it was a bad time to buy.

Although more are positive about purchasing, experts say it is the balance of five between the figures that is significant.

It is the lowest since the survey started in April 2011 and has plunged from 34 during the first three months of the year.

On top of these figures, the International Monetary Fund is expected to sound the alarm today over the housing market – just days after predicting that Britain will be the fastest growing major economy in the developed world.

The IMF expects the economy to grow by 3.2 per cent this year – nearly double the 1.7 per cent expansion forecast for the US. But in a report on the UK, it is likely to repeat its warning that a housing bubble could derail the recovery.

Worried: Nearly a fifth of people say they fear the impending hike in mortgage rates, now at an all-time low

The average price of a home in Britain has risen by more than 10 per cent in the last 12 months to £262,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.

Prices in London are up more than 20 per cent to £492,000, but it said ‘hotspots’ with particularly strong gains had popped up in Salford, Greater Manchester; Brough, East Yorkshire; and St Leonards-On-Sea in East Sussex.

The recovery in the housing market and the wider economy has raised the prospect that interest rates will increase before the end of the year, having been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned last week that as the economy normalises, the rate will need to rise.

According to the Halifax, people in London and the South East, where homes are more expensive, were the most negative about buying a property, while those living in Scotland and the North East were the most positive.

But while concerns about buying a home have increased, confidence about selling has never been higher, it said. Some 57 per cent of people think now is a good time to sell, while 32 per cent think it is a bad time – giving a balance of 25.

Craig McKinlay, mortgages director at Halifax, said: ‘Over the past two years consumer confidence has continued to grow. However it appears that we’ve reached a tipping point, with the equilibrium between buyers and sellers much more out of sync.’

Howard Archer, of research group IHS Global Insight, said: ‘While house prices look likely to keep rising over the coming months, it looks probable there will be some moderation.’
