Questioned: Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes is being questioned after the death of his son

A Mexican diplomat and his wife are being questioned by police after their four-month-old son died with cuts and bruises across his body, police said.

Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes, 36,
and his wife, Gina Ximena, 26, took their unconscious baby son, Eduardo Rocha Ovalle, by taxi to a Manhattan hospital around 9pm on Tuesday night.

The child was not breathing and was pronounced dead at NYU Langone Medical Center at 9.36pm. Staff contacted police.

Authorities said an autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of the boy's death, but it has been deemed suspicious because of 'bruising on his hands, feet, back and genitalia'.

The New York Daily News reported that the baby boy had a laceration to his scalp and cuts on his right thumb and a toe.

Both of the parents are answering questions at the Midtown South Precinct, although police sources said that they have not given any explanation as to what had happened in their home.

'I can tell you that the parent, the 
father is an employee of the Mexican consulate here in New York,' NYPD 
Commissioner Ray Kelly said Wednesday.

'The
baby expired at the hospital. When the medical examiner responded, he 
determined that an investigation should be done to determine the 
specific cause of death and that’s what’s going forward right now,.'

Home: Police have been called to the family's home in this Manhattan building twice for domestic spats

The Mexican Consultate's Office has not yet responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.

NYPD officers have been called to the couple's home on 32nd Street in Manhattan twice since September for verbal disputes that did not result in arrests, police confirmed.

Wanda Hernandez, 52, the super of the building where the family lived, told the New York Post that the couple had lived in the apartment for about a year but they they were behind on their rent.

She added that the couple were planning to go back to Mexico on December 31.

Hernandez said that when she left police into the apartment there was no visible signs of blood or violence.

She added that around two months ago she found the mother on the door steps talking to a female officer, telling her: 'He grabbed me so hard, he shook me.'

'She was crying,' Hernandez told the Post. 'She told me her husband bruised her and she was showing me the bruises on her arm. She said he doesn’t want to give her the baby.'

The couple was planning to go back to Mexico on Dec. 31st, Hernandez said.
