Costa played all but eight minutes for the national team last week and Mourinho revealed: 'Yes. The Spanish team played in Luxembourg on Sunday. I gave them Diego, Fabregas and Azpilicueta.

'I gave them two days off, Monday and Tuesday, so they had to report to train on Wednesday at 3pm. And Diego was here Monday at 9am. So you can imagine how strong he was to be here at 9am on Monday.' 

The Chelsea boss added: ‘I don’t lose my time contacting managers from national teams. In the past they used to contact me, but it is never my initiative to contact national team coaches. 

‘They have the power, we don’t have the power.

'Every Chelsea player who is selected at that time, we are happy that the players represent their country.' 

Ramires, Andre Schurrle, John Obi Mikel and Didier Drogba could also miss the trip to Selhurst Park as Mourinho admitted Chelsea have a 'long, long' injury list.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho revealed on Friday that Costa returned to the club on Monday morning
