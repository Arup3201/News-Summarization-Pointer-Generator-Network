A group of pensioners have been banned from holding a singalong concert at their local community centre – unless they hire security.

The event was organised by 78-year-old Alma Morris to raise funds to help save the threatened  venue.

She wanted a bar so some of the 100-plus elderly guests could enjoy a sherry but was told by council officials that, if alcohol was involved, she would need two bouncers.

The former caretaker, from Sandyford,
Staffordshire, said: ‘I don’t know what they think might happen in a 
room full of pensioners – it’s ludicrous.

'Never had anything like this before': Tom Simpson, from the Sandyford and Goldenhill Residents' Association is amazed by the local council's demand to charge organisers for two bouncers a pensioner event at Goldenhill Community Hall

‘We just wanted to put on a nice night of singing.

‘Some people like to have a drink at these things but there is certainly not going to be any binge-drinking going on.’

The decision has angered residents 
because Stoke-on-Trent Council has pledged to support them in their 
attempts to take over local community halls.

Mrs Morris said booking Goldenhill 
Community Hall would cost £120 before paying an extra £100 for security –
eating straight into any potential profit.

She added: ‘It is coming straight out of people’s pockets and those security men will have the easiest shift ever.’

The council said it would make a final decision on the security guards after looking over profit and loss margins.

Eric Jankowski, 82, said: ‘It's not about ticking boxes but making a sensible decision. A load of OAPs in their 70s and 80s are hardly likely to go wild are they? We just want to have fun like everyone else.

‘Now it seems that some jobsworths are, as usual, spoiling the party. It's such a shame that people don't seem to have any common sense anymore.

For health and safety: Organisers have since cancelled the event, which was raising money for an under threat elderly day home, because they cannot afford the 'ludicrous' fee on top of a £120 hall booking fee

Denise Harding, 72, said: ‘They don't have doormen or bouncers on the door at my local pub when my son takes me on Thursday afternoons and they have a bar there. 

‘Why does the community centre need one? It doesn't make any sense to me.’

Tom Simpson, 55, who is secretary of Sandyford and Goldenhill Residents' Association, said: ‘If they were organising drunken booze-ups then I could understand but not with fund-raising events like this one.

‘I think the council needs to consider every event on merit and it is hard to fathom why they have to pay extra for security.

‘The bar staff are already city council employees. I'm sure if there was a problem they would be capable of calling the police. We have never had anything like that happen before.’

Peter Price, the council's resident director of services, said that he and Councillor Ruth Rosenau would make a final decision on the security guards after looking over the profit and loss margin in the coming months and a council spokesman confirmed it was investigating the matter.

Mr Price said: ‘I think the additional cost is going to deter people from booking the venue. It is almost double what it will cost for the hall and they are out-pricing themselves.’

Speaking about the closures, he said: ‘We need to establish whether community halls are going to be financially sustainable for the future.

‘In times of financial hardship, the funding that we have as a city council will mean we have to go through some very difficult decisions.’

Yesterday other party-going pensioners who were expected to attend the bash reacted with shock to the ruling.

Ethel Boreham, 82, from Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'They might have needed the bouncers if I was going out 60 years ago, but not any more. We're not really the rowdiest of bunches..

'Most of the girl's will just sit there knitting, no doubt. Either that or a crossword.

'The only thing I might need a bouncer for is helping me up when my dodgy knees go at the end of the night.'

Her husband Ron , 84, a retired delivery driver, added: 'I can't imagine it is ever going to kick off there really.

'Why on earth do they require doormen for a little fund-raiser at a community centre. It is absolutely bizarre.

'What do they think we are going to get up to? Our days of round-the-clock parties are long gone.'
