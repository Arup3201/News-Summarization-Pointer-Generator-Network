'You've done alright': Sandy Nardo, who has had 140 lovers, admired Ruth Langsford's husband Eamonn Holmes on today's This Morning

An Irish mother who has kept a diary detailing her sexual history with 140 men has said she could make room in her 'little black book' for Eamonn Holmes.

Sandy Nardo, 53, from Dublin, made the proposition as she was interviewed by the TV presenter and his wife, Ruth Langsford, on today's This Morning. 

Speaking of how she has racked up so many lovers over the years, Sandy said: 'I was kind of looking for a husband but it's hard to get the qualities you want in one guy.'

She added to Ruth: 'You've done alright. I might be able to make a little space sometime if you ever get tired of him.'

An awkward-looking Eamonn quickly changed the subject to the viewers' comments while an unflappable Ruth asked Sandy if she had 'commitment issues'.

Sandy said she has had so many lovers because she 'likes collecting things' and keeping a diary of her conquests became a ritual. 

'I like to keep lists of things, it's a habit. It might be a bit of OCD,' she admitted.

She explained how she slept with 140 men around the world - often just one night stands - as she travelled with her job as a translator. 

She started a list where she would rank them on their looks, dress sense and 'emotional state'. 

She would also keep a record of their 'solvency' (i.e how well-off they are) and how long the relationship lasted.

The 140 men have all been listed with a nickname such as 'Earls Court Tube Arab', 'Italian Prince', 'Blond photographer' and alarmingly, 'The Pervert'.

She said: 'Some of them were permanent for a while but then I might move countries.'

She added: 'They were often one night stands, never to be repeated just to put down in my "little black book".'

Holding on to her man: Sandy said she could make room for Eamonn in her 'little black book' if Ruth ever got tired of him 

Sandy did marry and had children and her ex-husband scored 10/10 on her list - even though the marriage didn't last because he was 'mentally wrong'. 

She's says she still on the hunt for 'The One' - although she doesn't think a man that has all the qualities she wants actually exists. 

'I wasn't going to settle for one person who didn't have all the qualities,' she said.

Her diary is a way for her to keep track of the many men in her life and evaluate her relationships.

Ever the professionals: Eamonn and Ruth on today's This Morning took Sandy's comments in their stride

Scoring system: Sandy rates her lovers on their looks, dress sense and solvency

'You can got back over and see what you've got,' she explained. 'If they behaved themselves they might get an extra mark.'

She added that it's also helpful in allowing her to choose a suitable date for certain occasions.

She said: 'The reason for the list and the score is you might be in the mood for someone who has good humour, but that person might not be solvent with a good car. 

'So if you want someone to take you to a show, you would go to that person.'

When viewers suggested that Sandy's list was sexist, she replied: 'I don't know, if a man did this I think he would be, but I think a girl can get away with it.'
