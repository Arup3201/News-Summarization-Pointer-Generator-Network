An artist has created sculptures of some of Britain’s most iconic landmarks - out of chips and mushy peas.

Prudence Staite, 33, and her team of assistants used 10kg of chips to make edible versions of the London Eye, Big Ben, Stonehenge, the Angel of the North and the White Cliffs of Dover.

Ms Staite, from Gloucestershire, said her chip art required a 'perfect combination' of chip shop chips and oven chips for each sculpture, and just the right amount of mushy peas to create the surrounding landscapes

Time consuming: Prudence Staite's Angel of the North sculpture required 240 chips and took 12 hours to produce. The central figure is made from chip shop chips, while the wings are oven chips

Ms Staite's Angel of the North sculpture required 240 chips and took 12 hours to produce, while the Dover design - dubbed the ‘White Chips of Dover’ - needed only 70 chips and just took four hours to complete.

To ensure Scotland was represented in the collection, Ms Staite also created a Loch Ness Monster - using just seven chips.

Mushy peas act as grass in the versions of Stonehenge and the Angel of the North and on top of the Dover cliffs.

Ms Staite's edible art was commissioned to celebrate Chip Week 2014, which is organised by the Potato Council.

She said: 'We had so much fun with this project, from the very first sketches to the technical challenges around how the sculptures would hold together.'

'Iconic landmarks in Britain are so important to our cultural history and eating chips is such a British tradition that it felt natural to combine the two and create some history of our own. It did leave us a little hungry though,' she added.

Stu Baker, of the Potato Council, said: 'Britain is truly a nation of chip lovers and Chip Week is a fantastic celebration of our great food tradition.

'We always enjoy the creativity and ingenuity that Chip Week tends to inspire and Prudence has certainly taken it to a whole new level...So why not go to your local chippy and have a try yourself?'

Britons spend on average £4.8 million a week on fish and chips, with 250 million meals sold in the UK each year.

In a survey of 2,000 people by the Potato Council, 56 per cent said they buy fish and chips to eat at home as a family meal.

Britain boasts 10,500 specialist fish and chip shops and the industry employs 65,000 people, with more than 1.6 million tonnes of potatoes turned into chips anually.

The survey also found that a fifth of Britons claim to have shared a fish and chip dinner on their first date.
