The clippings of Tom Huddlestone's famed afro haircut has raised a staggering £6,300 after being auctioned off on eBay.

After one of the most eagerly-anticipated haircut changes in Barclays Premier League history - when the Hull midfielder swapped his fuzzy afro for a sleek mohican - Huddlestone decided to sell his hair for charity

The former Tottenham man had resolved not to have a haircut until he broke his goal drought, but hadn't anticipated that it would be two-and-a-half years between trims.

But Huddlestone saw the opportunity to
 sell his old hair and raise a bit of cash for his 'Huddlefro' campaign for a charity of his choice: 
Cancer Research UK.

You may not have thought that second-hand hair would fetch a great deal of money but - despite the eBay description saying it was 'fluffy' with 'one previous owner' - an anonymous bidder stumped up the astonishing amount.

Huddlestone
 finally had his mop chopped for charity, by barber Lance Lowe in the 
home dressing room at the KC Stadium, following his goal in Hull's 6-0 
win over Fulham.

Generous: Huddlestone's JustGiving page, which shows that he has raised more than £36,000 as of Thursday

Final outing: Huddlestone's hairdo was seen for the last time at Liverpool on New Year's Day

The midfielder told MailOnline Sport after his haircut last week: 'I am just relieved to be finally getting rid of it. And it definitely feels a bit colder now.

'I had a couple of requests on Twitter for a Mr T Mohican but have decided not to go as drastic as that.

‘Hopefully the next one (goal) will not be as
 long coming along. The main thing was to raise awareness and some money
 and that has been brilliant. In hindsight it probably wasn’t the best 
idea in the world.

‘It has 
been dragging on for too long now and the main things is I managed to 
get a goal and then raise some money and I can get the barnet cut.’

The barber started on the right-hand side of the midfielder's hair as he sculpted the Mohican.

It
 was enough of a spectacle to attract some of his team-mates as 
spectators, such as Jake Livermore, who tweeted a picture, and David 
Meyler and Robbie Brady who both donated £2,000.

Huddlestone had vowed not to cut his hair until he scored. That promise was made 55 games ago.

He
 has raised more than £36,000 for Cancer Research on his JustGiving 
page, with £5,000 of that coming from his former England Under 21 
team-mate Nedum Onuoha. His target is £75,000.

Supporters can own a chunk of Huddlestone's hair after Hull began an auction for a piece of his barnet on eBay.

The current highest bid for a chunk of his hair stands at £3,400.

Hull City’s head of medical services Rob 
Price made an early start on the operation on Saturday at the KC Stadium as part of an unusual 
goal and 27th birthday celebration for Huddlestone.

The midfielder said after the win over Fulham: ‘That’s
 been planned for 18 months, it was just about finding the opportunity to do it.

‘Obviously it’s been a long time 
coming. A lot of my family were at the game and staying with me for 
Christmas and my birthday so to score in front of them was pleasing.

‘It
 will be a little bit strange for it (the hair) to go. I think the physio has cut a
 little bit too much out as well in the celebration but obviously I can 
have it however I want now. And it’s raised a good bit for the charity, 
which is the main reason behind it.'

And
 spectator Livermore said: ‘It is great to see him get his haircut and 
the most important thing is to raise money for the cancer research 
charity.

‘I
 told him a few styles but I am not sure he took much notice. I would 
have liked to see him put a bit of colour in there but it is pretty 
bland so we will see what he ends up with.’
