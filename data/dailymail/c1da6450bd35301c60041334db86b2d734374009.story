A jealous engineer strangled his wannabe glamour model girlfriend during a sunshine holiday and dumped her naked body in the sea before flying back to Britain alone, a court heard yesterday.

Christopher Chittock throttled pretty blonde Sarah Shields with his bare hands on a deserted Gran Canaria beach after flying into a rage when he discovered texts to an ex-boyfriend on her phone, the court was told.

He burned her belongings but flew back to their home in Ipswich, Suffolk, with her mobile and messaged her friends and family pretending to be Miss Shields and claiming she had stayed in Spain with a new lover, prosecutors said.

Divorced father-of-one Chittock, 38, was arrested when Spanish police identified her body three days after returning to the UK.

State prosecutor Beatriz Sanchez claimed Chittock killed the 23-year-old Katie Price fan on July 6 2010 after discovering a text to ex-boyfriend William Newham saying: 'I wish you could be here with me.'

She told the jury of four men and five women set to decide the Brit’s fate: 'He hit her several times in the apartment shouting she was a whore.

'Then he took her to a dark, deserted beach opposite their holiday complex and with the aim of ending her life, punched her repeatedly in the face until she fell to the ground, causing her injuries including a broken nose.

'After, he sat on top of her and began to smash her head on the stones on the beach.

'While she was still alive but weakened and stunned and swallowing blood because of her broken nose, he took advantage of her defencelessness and began to strangle her with his bare hands until she stopped breathing and died.'

Sarah’s naked body was pulled out of the Atlantic Ocean near the couple’s holiday apartment in the popular resort of Mogan early on July 7 2010.

Chittock, who met the gas firm employee through work, flew back home three days later after allegedly burning a suitcase with all her personal belongings except her phone on a bonfire.

He was extradited to Spain in September 2010 and charged with her murder.

State prosecutors accused him yesterday at the Las Palmas Provincial Court of sending a series of incriminating text messages to her friends and family from her mobile after she was found dead to try to cover up his crime.

One, sent to her mother Angela as Miss Shields’s unidentified body was lying in a morgue, claimed she planned to stay on Gran Canaria with a new boyfriend and said: 'I’m going to miss my dog.'

Another was a text to best friend Sarah Clark, who had asked her to buy cheap cigarettes, was sent two days after Sarah was found floating in the sea, advising her when to pick them up from her at work.

Telling the court Miss Shields and 
Chittock’s mobile phones had been tracked using satellite technology, 
she added: 'How is it possible that your and her phones are located in 
the same place at the same time when you get off the plane at Stansted 
Airport and they are still located together when you return to the home 
you shared with Sarah in Ipswich?'

Chittock, dressed in blue jeans and a black top, spoke in a whispered voice through an interpreter.

He claimed his girlfriend, who dreamed of becoming a lingerie model, walked out on him two days before she was found dead for a mystery man called Jason she had met at their holiday complex the week before.

He admitted to shutting her out of their apartment after 'spotting them kissing' but insisted: 'I raised my voice to her because I was obviously upset but not my hand.

'I was obviously very upset but there’s a big difference between being upset and killing someone.'

He added: 'I ended things with her because I could see she didn’t want to be with me.

'I went for a walk and when I came back she had collected her belongings and had gone. That was the last time I saw her.

'I never sent any messages from her phone because I didn’t have it.'

Chittock choked back tears as he spoke of his broken marriage to ex-wife Catharine, mother of their nine-year-old son, who he left for Miss Shields.

She sat yards from him in the front row of the public gallery after flying to Gran Canaria to hear his evidence.

The trial, scheduled to last three days, continues.
