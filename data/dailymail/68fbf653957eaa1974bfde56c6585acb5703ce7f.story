Seven years after becoming infamous across Australia for trashing his parent's house after holding an epic party - Corey Worthington has re-emerged displaying a massive tattoo across his neck and claiming he has turned his life around.

When he was just 16 years old Corey posted an invite on his MySpace site and 500 people turned up to his suburban home in southeast Melbourne in January 2008 while his parents were on holiday.

The carnage that inevitably ensued attracted police helicopters and the dog squad to his family home in Narre Warren - not to mention huge amounts of media attention.

Ironically seven years on, Corey now has a beautiful new home of his own but will never forget the good times as a careless and unrepentant teenager.

Renowned for his belligerent lack of contrition about the debacle while sporting his trademark bright yellow hair and sunnies, Corey goes head to head for a second time with A Current Affair host Leila McKinnon who famously told the bold teenager 'to take a good hard look at yourself' after the crazy incident.

'I took the ride and just enjoyed it really, he says on A Current Affair airing on Thursday night.

'I will never let it go. I was 16, had fun and yeah always will have the yellow sunnies close to heart.'

Although he admits he endured a tumultuous ride, Corey relished in the media spotlight all the same.

'Yes there was a lot of up and down times with it all, but like I said 16 turning 17 it was a lot of fun I guess for someone that age,' he says. 

'Getting cameras thrown at your face, money left right and centre, it was yeah a big enjoyment, I sort of just took the ride and just enjoyed it really.'

Despite being called many names right across the world, Corey received numerous job offers including thousands of dollars to organise more teen parties.

The mayhem included out-of-control and intoxicated kids throwing glass and bricks, breaking letterboxes, shouting obscenities and even damaging police cars.

Mortified neighbours couldn't believe what was happening on their quiet suburban street with one comparing the noise that of a football crowd, adding that people were jumping on cars.

'Just hundreds of kids, big groups, large groups coming up and down the street and they were basically throwing bottles, smashing things, picking bricks up and smacking them against the lamp-posts,' said another to the ABC at the time.

But the drama didn't end there as a few weeks later Corey's mother, Joanne Delaney, was fined $500 for trying to prevent police for arresting her son the following month after the party.

Ms Delaney was reported at inviting the officers into her home but stopped them from going through a doorway. 

The mother-of-three, who was understood to be stressed at the time about her son's behaviour, was placed on a good behaviour bond and fined $500 for pushing a police officer in the chest. 

Corey's notoriety got him a gig on Big Brother four months after the massive party (pictured being interviewed by Kyle and Jackie O)
