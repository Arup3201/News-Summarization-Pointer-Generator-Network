Killed by police: Witnesses say Michael Brown was shot repeatedly by a white police officer in his home town of Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday afternoon

Computer hackers' collective Anonymous says it will find out and publish the name of the policeman who shot dead an unarmed teenager in Missouri.

The warning comes after the group earlier threatened to launch an online attack on police departments over alleged brutality in the handling of protests following the killing of Michael Brown.

Police have cracked down hard on demonstrators in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, who took to the streets after the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer on Saturday night.

Despite calls for calm, officers fired teargas and shot at least one person in a third night of rioting in the area last night. Police claimed the man shot had pulled a handgun on an officer.

As police tried to put the area on lockdown, messages posted on a newly established Twitter account called Operation Ferguson, which appears to be linked to Anonymous, announced: 'We have a deep source, and we have a name we BELIEVE to be the shooter [of Michael Brown]. It does NOT match any of the names being floated.

'We have our best operatives working as hard as they can to verify the leak on the shooter we were passed. PLEASE be patient.

'When we release the name of Mike Brown's killer, it will be in an unequivocal statement released through this Twitter account. No games.'

A little later another message suggested that the operation was proving more difficult than anticipated.

'To my fellow Anons, everyone remain chill,' it read. 'I realize this is an intense Op, and we are all trying our best. Let's fight cops not each other.'

There has been anger from Mr Brown's parents and their supporters after the Ferguson Police Department decided not to publish the name of the officer who shot their son.

Speaking out through the media last night, Lesley McSpadden, Mr Brown's mother, told the policeman who fired the shots: 'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

In a video posted on Sunday night, a self-declared spokesman for Anonymous warned Missouri police 'we are watching you very closely'.

'If you abuse, harass or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web-based asset of your departments and governments offline,' said a disguised voice, speaking over news footage of protests.

'That's not a threat, it is a promise.'

In the video and a press release posted to the Pastebin website, the video says Anonymous will 'attack ever server and computer' belonging to the police departments involved, as well as 'release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse.'

'We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet,' it said. 'This is your only warning.'

There was no immediate way to verify the video was genuine or that any attacks or hacks have been effective. The websites for Ferguson City Police and Missouri State Highway Patrol were still online when MailOnline checked this morning.

Investigators have released few details about what they believe happened when Mr Brown was shot, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Michael and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon.

At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St. Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request.

The fullest account of Michael's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Michael when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk.

Mr Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car 'to where it almost hit us.'

The officer, Mr Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it 'ricocheted' back. 

Mr Johnson said the officer reached through the window, 'grabbed my friend around the neck' and tried to pull him into the car. 

The officer then pulled out his gun and said, '"I'll shoot you' or "I'm going to shoot",' Mr Johnson said.

When the officer opened fire, Mr Brown was hit, said Mr Johnson, who hid behind a car. Mr Brown began running, Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said the officer pursued Mr Brown and fired again.

When Mr Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Mr Johnson said.

Mr Brown had just graduated from high school and was set to begin university this autumn.
