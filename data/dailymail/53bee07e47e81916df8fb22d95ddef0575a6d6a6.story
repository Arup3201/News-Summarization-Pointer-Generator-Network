There are lots of theories on how to beat jetlag, but a new app claims it can work out how travellers can adjust to new time zones faster.

Researchers behind Entrain - in a study partly funded by the Air Force - say they have developed mathematical formulas that calculate light exposure.

If it works, it means holidaymakers travelling long-haul will be able to use the free app to work out how much daylight they need and when to change their body clocks quicker.

Beating jet lag: A new app helps passengers adjust to time zones faster

Humans have an 
internal mechanism - the circadian rhythm or body clock - which
 synchronises bodily functions to the 24-hour pattern of the Earth’s 
rotation.

The clock is regulated by the bodily senses - most 
importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark.

When
 we work late, or travel to different time zones, the light our body 
expects to see - based on how long we've been awake - for example, is 
different, and this causes our body clock to fall out of sync.

This causes the feeling of jet lag.

Daniel Forger, University of Michigan math professor who led the research, said: 'If you get light in the wrong time or wrong way, it'll send you the wrong direction.'

A master biological clock, called a circadian rhythm, regulates when we become sleepy and when we're more alert.

When people travel across time zones, the body clock has to reset itself - with light exposure being its strongest regulator.

The Michigan team used two equations proven to predict someone's circadian rhythm, and with computer modelling calculated different schedules of light exposure for more than 1,000 possible trips.

It's possible to customise a block of
 time each day when you should be in light, the brighter the better, and
 another when you should avoid it, Forger's team reported in the journal
 PLoS Computational Biology.

For
 example, flying from Detroit to London, which is five hours ahead, 
arriving at 11am London time, it's generally thought that it would take a
 day per time zone to fully adjust.

Formula:

But the study suggests a three-day adjustment schedule.

On the day after arrival, holidaymakers should make sure they get light exposure from 7.40am to 9pm; on day two from 6.20am to 7.40pm; and from 5am until 7.20pm on Day 3. 

Entrain, an iPhone app, does the calculations. And if travellers don't go outside or stay up later, it adjusts the advice. 

And holidaymakers can help with the research by submitting their data to a University of Michigan study.

'I think it makes sense,' said Dr Charles Bae of the Cleveland Clinic's sleep disorder centre.

'Anything you could do to optimise your adjustment is welcome, without medications.'
