A study by Vouchercloud found 23% of Americans thought an MP3 was a Star Wars robot, such as C-3PO pictured

Do you know your MP3 from your C-3PO, or your Blu-ray from your stingray?

A study has discovered one in ten Americans think HTML - the name given to the code that makes up websites - is a sexually transmitted disease, while almost a third think a gigabyte is an insect.

The research was carried out to determine how knowledgeable people are when it comes to tech terms, and how important they think tech is.

Vouchercloud’s study asked 2,392 men and women aged over 18 to identify the meanings of a variety of words.

These words were a mix of technical and non-technical terms, and each term was given with three multiple choice answers. 

Participants were also asked how important knowing about technology is.

The term which stumped the most people (77 per cent) was SEO, which stands for Search Engine Optimisation and is the art of writing web content to make it appear higher up in search results.

Almost half of the participants who took part in the Vouchercloud study believed a motherboard used in the computers was the deck of a cruise ship.

Digital audio files, also known as MP3s, were mistaken from a robot from Star Wars by 23 per cent of participants, while 18 per cent though a Blu-ray – a high-definition optical disc successor to the DVD – was a marine animal.

Almost fifty of the participants thought that a tablet computer, such as the Apple iPad Air pictured, was a device used to monitor medication and remind people to take tablets

SEO - SEO stands for Search-Engine Optimisation and is the art of writing web content to make it appear higher up in search results.

HTML - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the code used to build websites.

Gigabyte - a measurement unit for the storage capacity of electronic devices including phones, hard drives, and more.

Motherboard - a circuit board used to hold and power the main components of a computer.

MP3 - a digital audio file format.

Blu-ray - a disc format used to store high-definition videos seen as a successor to the DVD.

Software - a generic term for computer programs.

USB - USB stands for Universal Serial Bus and is a type of connector. 

Other terms that confused the participants included software, which was mistaken from comfortable clothing, and USB, which was mistaken from the acronym of a European country.

Almost fifty of the participants thought that a tablet computer was a device used to monitor medication.

Despite these gaps in knowledge, 61 per cent said it was ‘important’ to have a good knowledge of technology today.

‘Technology is a huge interest for our user base, and month after month we see thousands of people visiting our site to look for coupons and deals to use when purchasing their favourite tech products,’ said Jessica Glaus of vouchercloud.net.

‘We wanted to see just how far knowledge of tech terms goes for the average Joe on the street, being an online business.

'It seems that quite a few of us need to brush up on our tech definitions!

‘It’s perfectly understandable that a lot of people won’t know what SEO is, but it will be interesting to see how many more of these terms become more mainstream as tech continues to play a huge role in our lives.’

The study also found more than one in ten Americans (11 per cent) thought HTML - the name given to the code that makes up websites - is a sexually transmitted disease, while almost a third thought a gigabyte is an insect
