'There's a big gate today,’ a bald man in the public gallery whispered in broad Scouse.

It was the 118th day of the Hills- borough Inquests and it was Kenny Dalglish’s turn to give evidence.

Even the Rt Hon Sir John Goldring, bespectacled coroner in grey three-piece suit, blue tie and blue pocket square, seemed caught up in the hoopla as his counsel, Christina Lambert QC, tried to establish Dalglish’s bone fides.

But it was tragedy and not his professional abilities that brought Liverpool’s most venerated player to this court in a Warrington business park.

The events of April 15, 1989, when 96 supporters were crushed to death at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough during Liverpool’s FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, defined Dalglish as a legend of his bereft club as much as did his trophy-laden deeds as a player of extravagant ability.

Still, 25 years later, there is no closure for either the grieving relatives or Dalglish. The furrows on his brow have no doubt been deepened by the trauma of that sunny spring day in Yorkshire and its aftermath, which saw him attend up to four funerals a day, before he stepped down as manager, exhausted by duty, 21 months later. Dalglish’s ordeal in this fractious court lasted one hour and 45 minutes.

Having quizzed Dalglish about what he had described in his autobiography as fans ‘bunking in’ to watch the 1986 FA Cup final against Everton at Wembley, John Beggs QC, representing some of the police officers involved, then drew the court’s attention to Home Office reports of ticketless and drunken Liverpool fans at the 1989 FA Cup final, the month after Hillsborough.

Did people bunk in?

‘I have no evidence of people bunking in at Wembley (in 1989),’ said Dalglish, who added that there was ‘a clamour’ across Merseyside to ‘show unity for those who had lost loved ones at Hillsborough’.

Beggs asked if Dalglish thought fans arriving late or drinking too much at Hillsborough may have ‘contributed to the disorder that followed’. Lord Justice Goldring was unimpressed, telling Beggs that he knew ‘perfectly well’ the witness could not answer that question.

Three times the jury and Dalglish left the court as the lawyers argued. But despite the odd moment of clear anguish when he relived the day of ‘mayhem’ — how he was thankful his own 12-year-old son, Paul, was OK — Dalglish was calm and dignified.

Beggs claimed there was a ‘cohort of Liverpool fans before, during and after Hillsborough… who were prone to fight’. Dalglish countered: ‘Liverpool fans with that exception (the riot at Heysel Stadium in 1985) were very highly respected and revered.’

Dalglish was the 160th witness to give evidence in person. The Hills- borough Inquests, started after the Attorney General quashed the original verdicts, has heard character portraits of the dead, of how the emergency services acted and how the stadium was prepared.

The inquests are expected to run until next summer, when a jury of seven men and four women will pronounce on the memory of the 96 fans who perished at a football match.
