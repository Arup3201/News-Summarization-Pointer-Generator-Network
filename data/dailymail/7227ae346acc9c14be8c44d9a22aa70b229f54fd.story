He flies around the world, designs all the presents, looks after the elves and checks the entire list - twice.

But what would Santa Claus earn for his dutiful work if he were paid a US salary?

According to a study, this year the big man would take home $139,924.

Though it falls short of the $1.8 billion that a third of people believe he should earn, it is in fact a 1.5% increase on he would have got last year, up from $137,795.

Busy man: Santa Claus juggles 15 jobs all year in order to make Christmas and he should earn $139,924

In his most lucrative role as an industrial engineer - running the toy workshop - the big man would take home $116,742.

Taking care of the reindeer, technically farm work, should technically merit $4,347 a year.

And checking the list twice demands $537 annually, under a standard bookkeeping salary.

They are three of just 15 lucrative jobs St Nick dutifully carries out year by year, according to insure.com's Santa Index 2014.

The study compiles a list of each job and values each one.

It includes labor negotiator (with the elves), sleigh pilot, and cookie taster - which falls under the category agricultural inspector.

Finding out if you've been bad or good - and knowing exactly when you're asleep or awake - merits a private detective salary of $777 a year, if he delivers a result in 30 days.

Tasks at hand: Tending to the elves and running the workshop are his most lucrative jobs, a study says

The insurance firm offered the data to 895 adults to see if they felt the salary is justified. 

While 29% thought it was a pittance for the king of Christmas, another 29% felt he should get paid nothing for the charity.  

The estimated wage is almost five times the basic salary for imitation Santas who work in malls and at kids parties.

With an average wage of $20 an hour - though some get up to $300 an hour - most Santas take home $5,000 to $15,000 a season.

The study notes that Santa's wage is a touch more than his trusty deputy - the stay at home mom - would earn, and almost twice that earned by a stay at home dad.
