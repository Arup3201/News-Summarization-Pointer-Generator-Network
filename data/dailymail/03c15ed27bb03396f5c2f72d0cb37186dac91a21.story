Holiday death: Andrew Smyth, 32, from Surrey, is feared to have been a ‘honeytrap’ victim in Turkey

A British holidaymaker was killed and his bank account plundered after being lured by a woman he met on holiday in Turkey in a 'honeytrap', his parents insisted today.

The body of Andrew Smyth, 32, was found dumped in undergrowth four miles away from a nightclub where he had been, and his bank account cleared out through a cash machine.

But a coroner in Surrey recorded an open verdict - saying that he understood how the family concluded foul play, but could take the case no further after a four-year investigation.

However, Mr Smyth’s family believe his drink was spiked at the nightclub, before he was followed, robbed and murdered. His fully-clothed body was found face down in woodland.

He had traces of heroin in his body - possibly from the spiked drink, toxicology tests showed.

An inquest at Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking was told that the athletic electrician had flown to Antalya a week earlier for a fortnight’s break at his father and stepmother’s holiday home.

His friend flew home after a week but Mr Smyth stayed, going out drinking on a Friday night with a woman he had met at the resort.

However, at 3am the following morning, CCTV footage showed him leaving the club - shortly before a series of withdrawals were made from a cash machine, emptying his bank account.

Hours later his body was spotted in a forest with no cash in his pockets other than small change.

A post-mortem examination found a heroin metabolite, 6-MAM, in Mr Smyth’s body - indicating that the Class A drug had been consumed before his death, in September 2010.

Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl, who carried out an autopsy at the Royal Surrey Hospital in Guildford once Mr Smyth’s body had been repatriated, could find no evidence of a fight or any injuries. The original post-mortem examination was not carried out for five days.

He said the presence of 6-MAM showed that heroin specifically had been present, rather than any other opiates, and he had found water on the lungs - which was consistent with heroin toxicity.

Toxicology tests showed he was below the drink-driving limit, with just 55mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, 35mg off the 80mg UK maximum.

However the pathologist added that although the signs pointed towards opiate toxicity, given the state of decomposition, he felt unable to establish a cause of death.

Dr Fegan-Earl added: ‘An unusual fact is the location of Andrew’s body, which seems to be at odds with what he was doing, enjoying himself in a club.’

Mr Smyth grew up in Surrey and trained to be an electrician, before relocating to Swindon in Wiltshire, where he took on a new job and dated a number of women.

He had flown to Turkey in September 2010 for two weeks with a woman he had met on dating website Plenty of Fish. 

Amanda Miles told the hearing that the pair had only met a few months earlier, kissed once and decided afterwards that they were better off as friends.

They pair stayed at an apartment in Side owned by his father and his partner, then Lynne Cannon.

Mr Smyth’s father told the inquest that he had received regular phone calls and texts from his son while he was away, which was unusual - but he had been having trouble with Miss Miles.

She conceded they had had a volatile friendship, and that they had argued over ‘silly’ things because Mr Smyth was often in a bad mood - which led to a row in the holiday resort one night.

During the first week of the holiday, they decided Miss Miles would leave early and, after changing flights, she left Turkey on the Friday. 

That night Mr Smyth went out drinking at a bar called the Light House, but never came home.

His decomposing body was later found dumped in a remote area of woodland by passer-by Adam Yesilova, who was collecting beer cans.

Barman Soner Korkmaz told the hearing that Mr Smyth had gone to the club with a woman and the pair had dinner and drinks together.

His companion, Emilya Agayeva, insisted he had vanished, forcing her to pawn her earrings for a taxi fare home after running out of money.

However, the barman claimed Mr Smyth had come and gone to get more cash to buy drinks, during which time two men joined the woman.

After Mr Smyth had left the club in the city of Side once more, the woman stayed drinking, dancing and kissing one of the men.

His family believed she could have been acting as a honeytrap and pointed to CCTV footage showing him leaving the club at 3am.

In the footage, as he exits, a man taps another male on the shoulder and motions for him to follow Mr Smyth, after which £150 was drained from his bank account in several withdrawals.

Mr Smyth’s body was found the following morning dumped in woodland four miles away. 

An only child, he was born in Torbay, Devon, before his family moved to Camberley, Surrey.

His parents separated when he was a teenager but he had a good relationship with both of them, living with both his mother and his father at different points in time.

The hearing was told how before his death Mr Smyth had a new job which he loved - and had planned to emigrate to Australia where his company also had an office.

His father Christopher Smyth said: ‘He was really happy. He loved the job, he liked going to work. The week before he went on holiday he moved to a new place which he loved.’

At points during the previous years he had struggled with a cocaine habit, the court heard.

Tests on Mr Smyth’s hair suggested ‘occasional use of cocaine’ in the months leading up to his death - but no other drug use other than ‘exposure’ to heroin, thought to be from when he lived with people who smoked the drug.

His family have travelled to Turkey on dozens of occasions to try to uncover the truth about what happened to Mr Smyth and to bring anyone responsible for his death to justice.

But his father, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after the death, is now too ill to fly there himself - confined to a wheelchair and having to carry oxygen with him.

Recording an open verdict, coroner Richard Travers said Mr Smyth had travelled to Turkey for a holiday after a rough patch in his life, which included a financial crisis.

He said: ‘By the summer of 2010 things were picking up for him and it was in these circumstances he decided to go on holiday to Turkey. He went to Turkey in the company of a woman called Amanda Miles and initially they had got on very well.’

After a breakdown in the friendship, Miss Miles left Mr Smyth at the resort  on September 10.

Mr Travers continued: ‘She left and did not see or communicate with him again. The evidence of what happened next is somewhat sparse. The cause of death was unascertained.

‘I fully understand that Andrew’s parents believe that there has been foul play. It is not for me to speculate what may have happened to Andrew.

‘It is simply not possible to know what happened to Andrew in the hours before his death. I regret that I am unable to assist the family in any further ways. I record an open conclusion.’

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Smyth’s mother Celia Armstrong said: ‘It’s not the verdict we wanted, but it’s what we expected.’

Her ex-husband Christopher Smyth, of Mytchett, Surrey, remained convinced people in Turkey were withholding information.

He said: ‘It’s undoubtedly a cover up. We had to work quite hard to get anything from the Turkish authorities. 

'I understand the coroner’s point of view, but without a doubt my son was assaulted. I firmly believe my son was murdered. He was beaten to death. He had everything to look forward to in life. I won’t ever give up (seeking the truth).’
