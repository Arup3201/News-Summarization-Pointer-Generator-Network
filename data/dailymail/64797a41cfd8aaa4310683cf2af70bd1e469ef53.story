A new reality dating show is in the works that claims to 'take one man and woman and strip them of all their
pretenses.'

In addition to the pretenses, the show also strips each contestant of their clothes - the gimmick for the show, which has the working title of Naked Dating, is that each person appears in the buff for their rendezvous with their potential suitor.

The idea for the show comes from Lighthearted Entertainment, which is the company behind other hit reality shows like Extreme Makeover, The Moment of Truth, Next, 72 Hours and Are You the One.

The show will feature one man and one woman as they date two potential suitors - each of whom is naked. According to the Hollywood Reporter, 'the series will explore the art of romance - free of preconceived notions, stereotypes and, yes, clothing.'

At the end of each episode, the two contestants 'will analyze what they've learned from their dates - and themselves - before deciding whether to move forward with their potential love interests.'

The show's host - who is yet to be named - will oversee the contestants and their dates, and the series will be filmed in an 'exotic locale.'

The show will appear on VH1 and has been green-lighted for 10 episodes.

According to VH1, the show will be edited to meet network standards.

'At first, this seems like a show that’s all about a
noisy, provocative hook -- and we embrace that,' Susan Levison, executive
vp original programming and production at VH1, told THR. 'But when you go deeper, it’s
really about something that we can all relate to -- the search for true love.
It’s also a series with heart and masterful storytelling -- both earmarks of an
engaging, must-watch show.'

Preconceptions: Other shows have tried to eliminate preconceived notions based on appearance in reality dating

Other networks have dabbled in the nude reality show genre - last year, Discovery attempted two naked reality shows, Naked Castaway and Naked and Affraid. SyFy 'explores the business and art of body painting' in Naked Vegas, and TLC is home to Buying Naked, a real estate show about a nudist couple looking for a 'clothing optional' home.

ABC entertained a reality dating show four years ago that had a similar theme. Dating in the Dark featured six contestants who get to know each other in a dark room where they can't see each other. Like Naked Dating, the idea is to prevent preconceived ideas based on physical appearance.

'We created this show based on marrying a provocative
idea with a back to basics philosophy. With all the dating options in the
world, what happens if you take one man and woman and strip them of all their
pretenses?' Lighthearted Entertainment President Howard Schultz told the publication. 'VH1 immediately understood our vision and
is a fantastic partner on a show that uses a social experiment to provide a fun
and entertaining look into how men and women interact when they bare all.'

A premier date for the new show has not yet been announced.
