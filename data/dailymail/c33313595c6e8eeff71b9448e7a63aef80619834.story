A retired US Marine-turned-security contractor has been named as the American victim in an attack on a luxury hotel in Libya that left five foreigners dead.

Cliff Taylor of Crucible LLC of Fredericksburg, Virginia, identified the worker as David Berry.

He declined to release any additional information on Berry, citing security concerns.

In a statement, Taylor said Berry was a contractor with Crucible.

Slain hero: Retired US Marine-turned security contractor David Berry, 34, has been identified as the American victim in an attack on a luxury hotel in Libya that left five foreigners dead 

'Today our company was a victim of a terrorist attack. Our company mourns this extraordinary loss with his family and friends,' the statement read. 

Taylor said the company was still gathering details on the death of Berry, who was among five foreigners killed Tuesday when a gunman stormed Corinthia Hotel in the Libyan capital.

A senior US State Department official confirmed the death of one American, but provided no details.

Taylor said Crucible employs less than 100 people

According to his LinkedIn page, Berry was a 12-year combat veteran with the US Marine Corps with extensive experience in special operations and intelligence.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Berry's father, James Berry, said his 34-year-old son was a native of Arizona who was fluent in Arabic. 

'My son is a warrior, he always wanted to do what he’s doing right now, or what he did up to this day,' Mr. Berry said. 'He was a man who had more respect and honor for this country than you would believe.' 

He was hired by Crucible only seven months ago, first as a site security manager in Libya and most recently as project security manager. 

A total of five guards and four foreigners were killed when gunmen stormed the high-end hotel in Tripoli, triggering an hours-long standoff.

The attack on the Corinthia Hotel, which sits along the Mediterranean Sea, underscores Libya's lawlessness since the Western-backed campaign to overthrow and kill Muammar Gaddafi. 

Libyan militants sympathetic to the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter.

Alleged members of a group called the Islamic State of the Tripoli Province posted a brief video showing burned cars in the hotel's parking lot and said it was to avenge the 2013 abduction by American commandos of a Libyan al-Qaida operative, Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, also known as Abu Anas al-Libi.

Al-Ruqai died earlier this month in a New York hospital of complications from liver surgery while awaiting trial for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

The attack started in the morning and included a car bombing, said Essam al-Naas, a spokesman for a Tripoli security agency.

Libya's security forces responded and after several hours of a stand-off, the attackers threw a grenade at the security forces, killing themselves and a security guard.

Ten people were also wounded in the attack, including security guards and guests.

'The operation is over,' Mr al-Naas said, but added that the streets around Corinthia remained closed. He said an investigation was under way.

Earlier in the day, Mahmoud Hamza, commander of the Special Deterrent Force, told private satellite television station al-Nabaa that five foreigners were killed, without elaborating, but Mr al-Naas later revised the casualty toll.

It was not clear if the two assailants were the only ones involved in the attack, earlier reports claimed one militant had been arrested.

As the standoff developed, a security official said the gunmen had taken hostages, though he had no further details. Two commercial landmark towers behind the hotel were evacuated out of security concerns, he said. 

A member of staff in the hotel said the attack began when five masked gunmen wearing bulletproof vests stormed the hotel after security guards at the hotel's gate tried to stop them.

He said they entered the hotel and fired randomly at the staff in the lobby.

The staffer said the gunmen fired in his direction when he opened his door to look out. He said he joined the rest of the staff and foreign guests fleeing out the hotel's back doors into the parking lot.

When they got there, he said a car bomb exploded in the parking lot, only a hundred meters away.

He said this came after a protection force entered the lobby and opened fire on the attackers. He said two guards were immediately killed.

The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared being targeted later by militants. He said the car bomb left at least five cars in the parking lot burned and damaged some windows in the hotel's facade.

He said the hotel had Italian, British and Turkish guests, but it was largely empty at the time of the attack.

He said the militia-backed Prime Minister Omar al-Hassi usually resides at the hotel, but was not there Tuesday. Al-Hassi's security guards also weren't there, he said. The hotel previously came under attack in 2013 when a former prime minister was abducted there. 

EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern, calling the attack 'another reprehensible act of terrorism which deals a blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya' 

In a brief statement on Twitter, the Tripoli branch of Isis claimed to have stormed the hotel 

EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern, calling the attack 'another reprehensible act of terrorism which deals a blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya'.

She expressed 'solidarity with the victims and their families' but provided no details of casualties.

'Such attacks should not be allowed to undermine the political process,' Ms Mogherini said in a statement.

A spokesman for the Malta-based Corinthia Hotel chain, Matthew Dixon, told AFP by telephone: 'Our thoughts are with our staff and guests. We have no further information.'

Since Gaddafi's ousting, Libya has been torn among competing militias and tribes vying for power.

The Islamist-backed Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) militia alliance took control of Tripoli last summer, forcing the country's internationally recognised government to flee to the far east.

The militia-backed government in Tripoli said the target of the attack was Prime Minister Omar al-Hassi. Spokesman Amr Baiou told reporters Mr al-Hassi was unharmed.

In a brief statement on Twitter, the Tripoli branch of Isis claimed to have stormed the hotel, the SITE Intelligence monitoring group said.
