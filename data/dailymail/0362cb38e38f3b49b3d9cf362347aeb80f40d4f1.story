It may have been a chilly start but today looks set to be a scorcher, according to BBC Breakfast. 

Presenters Susanna Reid and Bill Turnbull couldn't help but get the giggles when weather forecaster Carol Kirkwood accidentally 'clicked her clicker' twice and predicted 99 degree temperatures. 

The presenter had to jump in front of the chart behind her at about 7.19am which showed the temperatures for six cities identified simply as 'Town name'.

Blunder: Carol Kirkwood appeared on BBC Breakfast this morning unaware of mistake in her temperature chart

Oops: Remaining professional the popular forecaster tried to cover the mistake

Remaining professional, the popular forecaster tried to cover the mistake shouting: 'I'm going to block this chart.' 

Susanna Reid could be seen laughing while Bill Turnbill joked: 'It's going to be boiling in town... I've heard of scorchio, but that's ridiculous.'

BCC Breakfast later tweeted: 'Hmmm. What was Carol saying earlier about a chilly start? Oops! Not like our favourite weather presenter to put a foot wrong... if only it was a bit warmer!' 

As well as her Breakfast duties, Carol fronts the Weather Show for the BBC News channel and she's also appeared regularly as part of the One Show's team of reporters on BBC One.

She has become a regular fixture for Breakfast's outside broadcasts from Wimbledon and Ascot and was awarded for her work by the Television and Radio Industry Club winning best weather presenter twice in 2003 and 2008.

In September last year Ms Kirkwood was at the forefront of another blunder when a satellite map says temperatures were going plummet to -88C followed by a leap to 88C later in the day.

The presenter was forced to jump in front of the screen again as it showed how freezing temperatures - only ever found in the Antarctic - would descend upon Norwich, Glasgow and the Shetland Islands.
