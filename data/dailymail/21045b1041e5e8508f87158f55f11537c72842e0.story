The style set is once again embracing a rather risqué take on the traditional tuxedo trend by wearing the low-cut style without anything on underneath.

The look, which rose to fashion fame six years ago thanks to Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham, was seen on Rihanna and Emma Watson on the red carpet at the British Fashion Awards last night and has recently been worn by everyone from Cara Delevingne to Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence. 

While some stars choose to style the low-cut jacket by itself, accessorizing only with jewelry and a handbag as Rihanna did with her Stella McCartney design at the BFAs, other fans of the trend prefer to model a full tuxedo, as often worn by Cara and her fellow Burberry model Suki Waterhouse.

Red carpet trend: Rihanna and Emma Watson opted for completely different tuxedo styles at last night's British Fashion Awards

Tux lux: Cara Delevingne (R) is a long-time fan of the low-cut look and has previously stepped out in a variety of tuxedo styles, including this burgundy Burberry number which she wore to a pre-BAFTA party, where pal Suki Waterhouse (L) also opted for a revealing jacket

All shapes and sizes: The tuxedo trend has been seen on a wide variety of celebrities, from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (L) to Gwyneth Paltrow (R) 

Harry Potter star Emma chose to team her Dior tuxedo jacket with a Misha Nonoo jumpsuit at last night's award ceremony, choosing a slightly more demure look than Rihanna's flesh-baring style. 

While Cara chose a beaded Burberry gown for her red carpet appearance at the star-studded event, at which she picked up the award for Model of the Year, the model-turned-actress has often made clear her fondness for the tuxedo trend in the past. 

During the past year, Cara has been spotted out and about sporting a number of tuxedo-style ensembles.

Favoring Burberry's classic colored designs, the star wore a burgundy numebr at Harvey Weinstein's pre-BAFTA party in London - where she matched her look to close friend Suki Waterhouse, who also wore a Burberry design - before choosing a blue style to wear to Burberry's London Fashion Week show in September.

The style has also been seen on the likes of Jennifer Lawrence - who wore a black Dior tuxedo dress to the premiere of her film Serena at the BFI London Film Festival earlier this year - and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - who opted for a quirky zebra-print jacket when she stepped out at Paris Fashion Week in February.

Meanwhile Gwyneth Paltrow styled her chic Tom Ford tux with a matching pair of trousers at the 2014 amfAR LA Inspiration Gala in October.

It is not the first time that the low-cut look has been worn by such a variety of high-profile fashion icons. 

Designer Victoria Beckham, who picked up the coveted award for Brand of the Year at last night's ceremony, wore a sequined tuxedo jacket to attend Robert Cavalli's 2008 Milan Men's Fashion Week Show alongside her former Spice Girls bandmates.

Shanghai style: The Burberry model also opted for a tuxedo when she attended a Burberry event in China 

Former Disney star Miley Cyrus turned heads when she arrived at the 2012 American Music Awards wearing a revealing white tuxedo dress by designer Jean Paul Gaultier.

But, while the popular trend has helped many stars to showcase the perfect amount of skin, the low-cut style in not without its risks.  

In March 2009, Kate Moss suffered an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction when she slipped out of her Yves Saint-Laurent jacket shortly after leaving Topshop mogul Sir Phillip Green's 57th birthday party in London.
