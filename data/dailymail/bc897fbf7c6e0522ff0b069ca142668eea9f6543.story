A pilot who was forced to make an emergency landing on a busy road has said he is considering giving up flying - because it is his second plane crash in just six years.

Danny Hall, 48,  from Torrington, Connecticut, walked away from crash landing his plane  in West Hartford after the power failed with just a sore back.

In 2008 the roofing company owner was forced to land his plane in a river in similar circumstances after the engine failed.

Mr Hall said during the incident on Saturday afternoon his single-engine Skyline Cessna experienced engine problems and lost power while flying from Robertson Field in Plainville to Hartford-Brainard Airport.

He said he radioed a controller at Hartford airport while looking for a place to safely put the plane down. 

'I said, "Tell my kids I love them if I don't make it." He said, "OK. Good luck,''' Mr Hall said.

Mr Hall said while he was looking for a place to land he noticed a road only a few miles from Hartford airport that did not appear to have any traffic on it.

He said: 'What I thought was a road was actually the bus route I guess they just built.

'I was kind of questioning why there were no cars on it, but I figure if I'm going to land a plane, I'm going to try to put it somewhere where no one is going to get hurt.'

The plane narrowly missed several homes and businesses and a wing broke off during the crash.

Mr Hall said: 'When I got out of the plane after it put down I noticed a little smoke coming up where the engine was.

'I popped my seatbelt, opened the door, got out of the plane and as I was [walking] away from it I realised I was safe,'

The $567 million bus-only corridor between Hartford and New Britain is nearing completion and is set to open early next year.

Mr Hall added: 'The most important thing, I'm just happy no one got hurt, especially on the ground. 

'I did what I had to do,'

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating why the plane lost power.

Six years ago, Mr Hall survived a plane crash into the Pawcatuck River in Westerly, Rhode Island. 

He said the engine on that Cessna failed about two miles from Westerly Airport.

An FAA investigation at the time found mice had built a nest in the plane, and when he pulled a device that prevents icing the mice and their nest were sucked into the carburetor, causing the engine to seize up.
