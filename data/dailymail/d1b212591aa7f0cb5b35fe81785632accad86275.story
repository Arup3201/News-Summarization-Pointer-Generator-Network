Five years after TV and film actress Mo'Nique won an Academy Award for her tour-de-force performance in the drama Precious, she finally found out why she wasn't being inundated with attractive offers like other Oscar winners. 

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, which appears in the magazine's February 27 issue dedicated to Gone With The Wind actress Hattie McDaniel's historic Oscar win in 1940, Mo'Nique revealed that it was director Lee Daniels who finally explained to her why her career went in the direction that it did.

The actress said she's learned that she was being punished for refusing to lobby the members of the Academy for votes and for not playing by Hollywood's rules.    

'I got a phone call from Lee Daniels maybe six or seven months ago. And he said to me, "Mo'Nique, you've been blackballed,"' the former star of the sitcom The Parkers recalled.

Speaking out: Mo'Nique took to Twitter to address the 'blackballing' comment in The Hollywood Reporter story 

'And I said, "I've been blackballed? Why have I been blackballed?" And he said, "Because you didn't play the game."'

When the 47-year-old comedian and actress asked the Oscar-winning director of Precious what game he was speaking off, Daniels reportedly declined to elaborate.

In a statement to the magazine, Lee Daniels later clarified his 'blackballed’ comment, explaining that Mo'Nique's unwillingness to actively participate in the Precious campaign in the run-up to the Academy Awards ceremony 'soured her relationship with the Hollywood community.'

Mo'Nique also said in the lengthy interview with the magazine that she got an undeserved reputation in Hollywood for being 'difficult.'

Non-conformist: Mo'Nique said she's been unfairly labeled' difficult' by industry insiders for her unwillingness to campaign for awards 

‘Whoever those people are who say, "Mo'Nique is difficult," those people are either heartless, ruthless or treat people like they're worthless,’ she declared.

According to the Baltimore native, she's been labelled ‘tactless’ and ‘tacky’ by some in the film industry, but she said that's only because as someone who grew up in a blue-collar family, she refuses to let anyone take advantage of her.

On Thursday, she took to Twitter writing: ‘To be BLACKBALLED or ostracized 4 ur views is a scary thought, however to say silent about what u see is scarier. #faceyourfears’

Over the past five years, Mo'Nique said she's been passed up for a number of plum roles in major TV and film projects, including Lee Daniel's The Butler, his prime-time Fox drama Empire and the upcoming Richard Pryor biopic, in which she was slated to play the ground-breaking comedian's grandmother.

‘Each of those things that he offered me was taken off the table,’ she said. ‘They all just went away.’

In 2009, Daniels cast Mo'Nique in the family drama Precious, based on the book Push by Sapphire.

A year later, she won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her heart-wrenching and terrifying portrayal of the title character's abusive mother.

In her acceptance speech, Mo'Nique invoked the memory of Hattie McDaniel, who became the first African-American actress to win an Oscar, thanking her for 'enduring all that she had to so I would not have to.'

Mo'Nique said that after taking home the coveted golden statuette that night, she thought that her career would blossom, but the reality turned out to be quite different.

‘Hattie said, "After I won that award, it was as if I had done something wrong." It was the same with me,’ she lamented.

With no new roles on the horizon, Mo'Nique and her husband, Sidney Hicks, took matters into their own hands and independently produced the coming-of-age film Blackbird, which has been on the festival circuit for the past year, Variety reported. 

The drama starring Mo'Nique and Grey's Anatomy actor Isaiah Washington will be released in 10 threatens in April.
