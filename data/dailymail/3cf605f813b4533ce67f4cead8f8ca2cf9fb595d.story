Team news

Manchester City 

New Manchester City signing Eliaquim Mangala remains unlikely to make his debut in Monday's Barclays Premier League clash against Liverpool.

The £32million defender only joined up with the club last week and is still short of match-fitness but defender Pablo Zabaleta could be back in line to start and loan midfielder Frank Lampard is available.

Goal scoring return: Sergio Aguero came off the bench to score for Manchester City in their opening game

Striker Sergio Aguero, who came off the bench to score at Newcastle last week, may not be ready to play 90 minutes while fellow forward Alvaro Negredo (foot) remains out long term.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Kompany, Demichelis, Nastasic, Boyata, Clichy, Kolarov, Silva, Milner, Nasri, Navas, Toure, Fernandinho, Fernando, Aguero, Jovetic, Dzeko.

Liverpool 

Summer signings Lazar Markovic and Alberto Moreno are in contention to make debuts in Liverpool's Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Monday.

Fit-again winger Markovic and defender Moreno, recruited last week from Sevilla, are both set to be included in the squad for the match but fellow summer arrival Adam Lallana's wait to make his bow definitely goes on, with the midfielder not quite ready yet as his rehabilitation from a knee injury nears its conclusion.

Jose Enrique's condition will be assessed, while Daniel Agger, Jon Flanagan and Oussama Assaidi remain sidelined.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Lovren, Skrtel, Enrique, Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Coutinho, Sterling, Sturridge, Jones, Manquillo, Toure, Sakho, Lucas, Can, Lambert, Markovic, Moreno.

The last time Liverpool came from two goals down to win a Premier League game was in this fixture in October 2008 (0-2 down, won 3-2).
