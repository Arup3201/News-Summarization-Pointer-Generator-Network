An ugly fight between a husband and wife on a budget airline has caused the aircraft to make an emergency landing in Bali.

The fight, on a Scoot aircraft flying from Sydney to Singapore, was so vicious that it is understood the woman received a broken arm while the man suffered facial injuries.

In what appeared to be a flight from hell, a third passenger was so intoxicated that the crew were concerned he was a threat to others and he alone would have been a reason for the aircraft diverting and making an emergency landing in Bali.

One passenger, Iris Tan, from Sydney, was travelling on TZ1 to Singapore for her cousin’s wedding.

A Scoot airlines flight from Sydney to Singapore had to make an emergency landing in Bali after two passengers got in a fight so bad that the woman's arm was broken

She told the MailOnline: 'About an hour into the flight someone asked for medical assistance… about six hours into the flight we got a notification saying we would be landing in Bali,' she said.

Iris Tan was sitting in the middle of the plane, so she did not witness the couple fighting, as they were seated in the front of the plane, and only saw the drunk man, who was at the back, when he walked through her compartment to exit the plane.

She was unaware a fight had taken place, but was told a medical emergency an hour into the flight meant they would have to stop in Bali.

The woman with a broken arm and man attached to a drip were escorted off the plane to meet with an ambulance when the plane landed in Denpasar.

When the flight landed, Ms Tan saw the man in his late 30s, with a drip attached to him, who seemed 'quite calm' leave the plane.

After half an hour waiting on the tarmac, two Balinese security guards boarded the plane and approached an intoxicated man who looked to be about 19- or 20- years-old.

'He was escorted off the plane and about 15 minutes later he was escorted back on [to collect his belongings] and he was pretty pissed off. He was punching the chairs along the way back to his seat, swearing his head off.

'He said: "F***, they’re going to kill me! Thanks for killing me!"

'That caused quite a bit of commotion.’

They were serving alcohol on the flight, but since Scoot is a budget airline, passengers have to purchase any booze they want to consume.

A Scoot spokesperson confirmed the separate incidents which had resulted in the emergency landing.

'Flight TZ001 from Sydney to Singapore was diverted to Bali because of a medical emergency. A couple (husband and wife) was, allegedly, physically fighting.

The flight made an emergency landing at Bali's Ngurah Rai International airport, where the passengers received medical treatment and talked to police  

'As a result of the altercation, the woman suffered from a suspected broken arm and the man was also injured. Upon arrival in Bali, they were met by an ambulance.

'Separately, a third passenger became intoxicated and was being abusive on-board.

'The Captain offloaded the man because he was deemed to be a threat to the safety of the aircraft and passengers.'

The drunk and abusive man was taken off the aircraft by Bali security officers and police. 

The flight, which departed Sydney airport at 12.40pm, was due to arrive at Changi airport at 6.50pm but did not touch down until almost 10pm.

The separate incidents come in the wake of a hijack alert on a Virgin flight last month when a confused man tried to enter the cockpit, believing it was the toilet.

Australian plumber Matt Lockley had to be subdued by the crew and was arrested by armed police when the jet touched down in Bali, though police later accepted his explanation that he had made a genuine mistake.

Bali airport authorities said the three offloaded passengers had been interviewed by police, but no immediate details were known.

The names and nationalities of the passengers have yet to be released.
