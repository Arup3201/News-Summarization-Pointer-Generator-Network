The unwanted bodies of dozens of dead foreign ISIS fighters have been left to pile up in Iraqi hospitals.

More than 100 corpses of Islamist combatants from 13 different countries are dispersed among the country's healthcare units. 

That's according to an unnamed, high-ranking official in the country's Interior Ministry, who told Arabic-language newspaper Akhbar Al Iraq that the dead jihadist's home countries refuse to accept them while local cemeteries won't take them either.

ISIS forces prepare for battle in Iraq. More than 100 bodies of jihadists have piled up in the country's hospitals

The government is still trying to figure out what to do with the bodies, which are reportedly from European, Asian and Arab nations.

According to the same official their countries of origin have told Iraq to 'Burn them or drown them, we don't want them.

'We took away their citizenship.'

The official added: 'These nations wanted to send a message first to Iraq; a message of support against terrorism and radicalism, and second to tell the people who want to fight with ISIS that they mean nothing to their countries and people.'

According to the London-based Arabic newspaper Al Quds Alarabi, Iraqi civilians and politicians are refusing to allow the foreign terrorists' bodies to be buried in cemeteries.

Most of the fallen fighters were killed fighting Kurdish Peshmerga forces or were hit by coalition air strikes.

The bodies of Islamic State fighters from abroad are often not wanted by their home countries

Some are jihadists who were executed for committing acts of terrorism. Several nations have moved to revoke citizenship of residents known to have left to join Islamic State.

The ministry official said talks are underway with the nations involved to explore possible options for getting rid of the unwanted remains, including burial in the desert in western Iraq.

But according to FoxNews.com, a colleague at the Interior Ministry denied the claims and said Iraq is responsible for burying bodies of Islamic State militants.

A US State Department official told the website that, for American citizens who are killed fighting abroad, it is up to his or her family to decide whether to bring their remains home.

The official said: 'The Bureau of Consular Affairs will locate and inform the next-of-kin of the US citizen's death and provides information on how to make arrangements for local burial or return of the remains to the United States.'

The latest data from the International Center for Study of Radicalization and Political Violence shows more than 20,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Iraq and Syria to join Islamic State.

The highest numbers of Islamic State fighters come from the Arab world. 

Tunisia and Saudi Arabia have each documented more than 1,500 citizens who have joined Islamic State. 

Western Europe accounted 4,000 fighters, with France leading the rank with nearly 1,200 militants. 

There have been an estimated few hundred from the United States and Canada.
