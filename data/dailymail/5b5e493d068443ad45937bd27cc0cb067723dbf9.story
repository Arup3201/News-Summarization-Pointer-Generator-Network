A very coordinated black bear at the Animal Ark Wildlife Sanctuary in Reno, Nevada, is a tetherball champ!

The bear is seen swinging the ball around the pole for up to three minutes at a time.

And, it obviously loves every moment.

Scroll down for video...

A big bear swipe: The black bear hits the ball

Watching it as it flies up and up and around

Woah, here it comes!

Duck! The ball misses the bear's head just barely and keeps swinging around the pole

Weeee, this is fun!

And around it goes again

Come'ere, you!

Ok, so maybe I need a little practice

Got it! I'm the champ.
