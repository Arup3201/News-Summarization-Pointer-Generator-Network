Contamination of chicken with a potentially lethal food poisoning bug is getting worse, new evidence revealed today. 

The proportion of fresh roasting chickens on supermarket shelves carrying campylobacter is up from 70 per cent to 72.9 per cent

At the same time, the number considered highly contaminated rose from 18 per cent to 18.9 per cent, according to figures from the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

Simply picking up chickens from a shelf to check the price is also a risk, the FSA warned.

It found the proportion of packs contaminated on the outside rose from 6 per cent to 6.8 per cent - or one in 14 packs.

Danger: The proportion of fresh roasting chickens on supermarket shelves carrying campylobacter is up from 70 per cent to 72.9 per cent. The bug is Britain’s most common cause of food poisoning

The increase compared to November figures suggest that supermarkets, farmers and processors are not doing enough to protect customers.

An estimated 280,000 people fall ill and 100 people die every year because of campylobacter, which is Britain’s most common cause of food poisoning.

The FSA says the resulting cost to the UK in terms of NHS treatment and lost productivity due to people being off work sick is a staggering £900 million.

The figures come as a European study published today warned about the emergence of new ‘superbug’ versions of campylobacter, which are resistant to antibiotic medicines.

As a result, doctors find it increasingly difficult to treat people who fall ill after handling and eating chicken.

The FSA says it expects stores to reduce the number of birds that are highly contaminated to no more than 10 per cent by the end of the year.

If this target is met - which seems unlikely - the FSA claims it would reduce the number of food poisoning cases by 84,000 and save around 30 lives a year.

Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, described the situation as ‘scandalous’.

The professor, who has studied campylobacter for 25 years, called for urgent action from stores and the government to protect shoppers.

The FSA figures show that Asda came out worst on virtually every measure with a contamination level of 78.9per cent and 31.1per cent at the highest level. 

By contrast, Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Waitrose saw a fall in the number of birds with the highest contamination. 

‘We have legislation to prevent harmful substances in our houses such as asbestos, yet we are happy to allow more than two out three chickens into our kitchens that can cause severe diarrhoea and in some cases can be life threatening,’ he said.

‘It has to be stopped at source and poultry needs to be campylobacter-free, which could be achieved through vaccinating flocks. Supermarkets and government agencies need to take responsibility.’

Professor Wren said a number of vaccines are in development and this work must be accelerated with funding from the government, the industry and, potentially, supermarkets.

Dr Andreas Karatzas, a food microbiologist at the University of Reading, said contamination on the outside of packs is a real threat.

‘It is particularly concerning that so many chickens are being sold with bacteria on the outside of the packaging. 

'This hugely increases the risk of cross-contamination to other food in your supermarket trolley or your fridge,’ he said.

The FSA today praised M&S for leading the way in tackling the bug. 

The store has moved to selling chickens in ‘cook in the bag’ packs, paying farmers a bonus if they keep their flocks bug-free, and blast or rapid chilling the birds in an attempt to kill campylobacter.

The store’s own most recent survey covering found the proportion of birds contaminated at the highest levels was down to just three per cent in January.

Mr Wearne said: ‘We warmly welcome what M&S is doing. It shows that one retailer can achieve the target through a programme of systematic interventions and we think others can, and should, do the same.’

Asda said it has introduced new measures to protect consumers, however these will take time to deliver results. 

The majority of its chickens are now being sold as ‘roast in the bag’ and it is looking at treating carcasses with Sonostream, which uses steam and ultrasound to kill the bug.

Mr Wearne added: ‘Campylobacter is killed by thorough cooking, but it should not be left to consumers to manage the risk. 

'It is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK, affecting an estimated 280,000 people a year.

‘Poultry is the source of the majority of these cases, so the industry should be making every effort to ensure chickens are as free from campylobacter as possible before they reach customers.

Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which?, said: ‘It’s unacceptable that we're still seeing such high and rising levels of campylobacter in chicken.

'People need reassurance that supermarkets are doing everything they can to make chicken safe.

‘This problem requires everyone in the food chain, from farmers, to supermarkets, and consumers, to improve practices if we want to cut infection rates.’

Mike Catchpole, chief scientist at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, said doctors are finding it increasingly difficult to treat people infected with superbug versions of campylobacter, which are resistant to antibiotic medicines such as fluoroquinolones.

‘The high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones observed in campylobacter isolates - from both humans and chickens - are of concern, considering that a large proportion of human campylobacter infections come from handling, preparation and consumption of chicken meat,’ he said.

‘Such high resistance levels reduce the effective treatment options for severe human campylobacter infections.’

The FSA Director of Policy, Steve Wearne, said the onus is on stores to reduce the number of birds that carry high contamination to under 10 per cent by the end of 2015.

He admitted the watchdog has no legal powers to punish stores that miss the target, however he said they would be held to account by customers.

‘Time is running out for the industry to take action to meet the target,’ he said.
