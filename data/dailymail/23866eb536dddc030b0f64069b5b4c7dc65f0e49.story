An inspirational Facebook campaign encouraging people to dive into cold water to help a five-month-old baby who is suffering from cancer has raised more than $30,000 in just one week.

The Plunge for Landon campaign hopes to raise enough money to cover the extensive medical care Landon Shaw, from Tarkio in Missouri, needs to treat the rare form of cancer he was diagnosed with in February.

Since it launched last Monday, thousands of people have already joined the effort - including a U.S congressman and participants from Spain, South Korea and Afghanistan - with more than 11,000 videos uploaded to the campaign's Facebook page.

Idea: The fundraiser encourages people to film themselves jumping into a cold pond or lake after nominating three others to do the same, with monetary pledges for each person who completes the challenge

The fundraiser encourages people to film themselves jumping into a cold pond or lake after nominating three others to do the same, with monetary pledges for each person who completes the challenge.

Organisers say they have lost count of how many people have already uploaded videos of themselves using the #plungeforLandon Facebook hashtag.

'I can't believe how viral this is going,' said Landon's mother Alyssa Shaw.

'My son has been such an inspiration to everybody and opened up people's eyes that you can't take life for granted,' she added.

Entire schools, police departments and businesses around the region have posted videos of participants taking the plunge.

Landon
 was four months old on February 23 when his parents took him to Children's
 Mercy Hospital in Kansas City to find out why he was vomiting and 
losing weight.

Doctors found a tumor on his left kidney, which they removed, and later discovered a large mass on his brain.

Worldwide: The plunge group's Facebook page had more than 23,000 members by Monday morning, more than 14 times the number of people who live in the small farming community of Tarkio

Ready: Tarkio residents have also held bake sales and fundraising suppers to help the Shaw family pay their medical and travel expenses. The Plunge for Landon campaign, however, that has brought in most donations

Landon's
 heart stopped during an operation to remove the brain tumor, his mother
 said, and he lost so much blood that doctors gave the family little 
hope their baby would survive.

'The surgeons came into the room and said they would be surprised if he made it through the night,' Mrs Shaw said.

Landon did make it through the operation however, and his condition improved enough that on April 1 she was able to bring her baby home.

But the child still has a long road ahead, with chemotherapy sessions, MRIs and CT scans. 

Mrs Shaw said that although she and her husband Brandon are on Medicaid  - the U.S. government program that provides health care coverage for lower-income Americans - it isn't nearly enough to cover the medical bills that are now starting to arrive.

The plunge group's Facebook page had more than 23,000 members by this morning - 14 times the number of people who live in the small farming community of Tarkio, two hours north of Kansas City.

Lydia Hurst, who helps maintain the group's page, said participants include a soldier in Afghanistan, and people in Germany, South Korea, Spain and Ireland.

Ty Rowton, also known as the red tight-wearing Kansas City Chiefs football team super fan 'X-Factor,' dove into a pond near Bonner Springs in Kansas on Friday after being challenged by several people he didn't know.

Nominate: Ty Rowton was challenged by several people he didn't know, and in turn challenged the Kansas City Royals baseball team, the Kansas City Chiefs American football team, and the fans of both sides

In turn, he challenged the Kansas City Royals baseball team, the Kansas City Chiefs themselves and all the fans of both teams to chip in to help Landon.

Ms Hurst took her own plunge last Tuesday in sub-zero temperatures.

Like most people she knows who did their own plunges, she said she never would have jumped into a frigid farm pond had it not been for the thought of the little boy.

'My legs got numb faster than I thought they would... It was shocking. I went home and showered and didn't get warm until about noon that day,' she added.

Residents of the former college town of roughly 1,600 have also held bake sales and fundraising suppers - popular events in the area - to help the Shaw family pay their medical and travel expenses.

It is the Plunge for Landon campaign, however, that has brought in the bulk of donations.

In one video, U.S. Representative Sam Graves - a lifelong Tarkio resident - is seen jumping head first into the Potomac River in Washington while wearing a suit and tie.

Before doing so, he challenged several other Republican leaders, both nationally and in Missouri, to take the plunge.

Lora Cummins, a former Tarkio resident who is now an ordained minister and beach body coach in Port Aransas, Texas, accepted the challenge last Wednesday.

She and some of her former schoolmates in Tarkio filmed themselves jumping into the Gulf of Mexico.

'All of us are so fortunate to have grown up there and forged lifelong bonds... Facebook has brought us all back together,' she said.
