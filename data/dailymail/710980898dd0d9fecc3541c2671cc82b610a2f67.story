The story of the 'Wolves of Wall Street' who ran a $200million stock market scam is about to hit the big screen after being turned into a blockbuster starring Leonardo Di Caprio.

But Jordan Belfort and Danny Porush, the real-life fraudsters behind the audacious crime who between them spent five years in prison, are also living Hollywood lifestyles after setting up lucrative new businesses after their release from jail, it was revealed today.

Porush lives in a $4million home and drives a Rolls-Royce convertible, while Belfort has been hanging out with Di Caprio, who is playing him in the film, directed by Scorsese.

Belfort and Porush set up Stratton Oakmont, a 'boiler room' firm based on Long Island designed to 'pump and dump' shares by hyping their prospects and quickly cashing in once their price rose.

They managed to rake in $200million from the fraud, which they spent on cocaine, prostitutes and a yacht once owned by Coco Chanel.

However, after the FBI caught up with them in 1996, Belfort spent 22 months in prison while Porush was sentenced to 39 months.

Belfort, 50, has written a pair of memoirs detailing his past misdeeds, The Wolf of Wall Street in 2008 and 2009's Catching the Wolf of Wall Street.

'It's easier to get rich quick when you don't follow the rules,' he told the New York Post this week - but he is adamant that he has not profited from his crimes.

He claims that all the proceeds of his book are going directly to the victims of the Stratton Oakmont fraud.

'I'm a wolf who became a more benevolent character,' he said. 'I refuse to glorify my past.'

The memoirs are currently being adapted into a Hollywood film, The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Di Caprio, Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, due to come out later this year.

Belfort bonded with Di Caprio during the filming of the movie, and said: 'I have tremendous respect for him.'

The former scammer lives in California and now makes a living giving motivational speeches, including talks on 'wealth creation' and corporate training.

Porush, 56, has started a business selling medical supplies in Florida, and appears to be able to support a glitzy lifestyle on its proceeds.

He lives with his second wife Lisa in a $4million mansion, and the couple drive matching Rolls-Royce Corniche cars.

'I would never try to profit from a crime I’m so remorseful for,' he told the Post.
