He often tops polls of the most desirable celebrity men, but it seems David Beckham's cool crown may be slipping.

The former England footballer, 38, has been replaced as most stylish man by singer/actor/all-round hotpot Justin Timberlake, 33, in a new fashion industry chart.

The list of Top 10 Most Stylish Men, compiled by digital TV channel Fashion One Television, also included Hollywood heartthrobs Ryan Gosling, 33, James Franco, 35, and Bradley Cooper, 39.

It may be some consolation for Beckham to know that he was still ranked higher than professional model David Gandy, 34, designer Tom Ford, 52, and chart toppers Harry Styles, 20, Pharrell Williams, 40, and Kanye West, 36.

A spokesman for Fashion One said: 'These are the male icons who are ambassadors of style and setting trends and influencing 
not only their fans and peers but also the fashion industry as a whole.

Actor Ryan Gosling, 33, is in third place followed by One Direction singer Harry Styles, 20, in fourth

In fifth place is accessory-loving Pharrell Williams, 40, while sharp-suited designer Tom Ford, 52, comes next in sixth

Actor James Franco, 35, is hot, and in seventh place, while model David Gandy, 34, is still a favourite in eighth

Kanye West, 36, and his leather trousers make the list at number nine and actor Bradley Cooper, 39, is last but not least at number 10

2. David Beckham

3. Ryan Gosling

4. Harry Styles

5. Pharrell Williams

10. Bradley Cooper

'There simply cannot be a most stylish men list without football and fashion icon, David Beckham.

'He may have retired from playing football but he certainly has not stopped sporting great fashions.'

But he added: '2013 was the year Justin Timberlake dominated the style game since it marks the singer's return to the stage and into the spotlight, with a much more mature but still refreshing and fun style.

'He has not only managed to bring sexy back, but also fedoras, sweater vests and skinny ties.

'He can and will wear nearly anything and pulls off all of those fashion choices with great confidence and swag.'
