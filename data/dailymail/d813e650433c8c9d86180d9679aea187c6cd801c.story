The father of a missing toddler begged for her safe return today and told whoever has her that 'they have no right'.

Justin DiPietro spoke on camera for the first time, saying that he would do anything in his power to help find his daughter, 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds.

Mr DiPietro last saw 
his daughter when he put her to bed at his home in Waterville, Maine on December 16. He reported her missing when he could not find her the 
following morning.

Plea: Justin DiPietro speaks for the first time about the disappearance of his 20-month-old daughter Ayla Reynolds in Maine and begs for her safe return

Mr DiPietro told the Today show: 'By coming here, it was in hopes of reaching out to the person that does have my daughter to let them know that what they’re doing isn’t right.

'You may think what you’re doing is right for Ayla, but it’s not. You have no right. You’re not her parent. She belongs home with her family.

He added: 'I love my daughter. I would never do anything to harm my daughter. She’s the world to me.'

Police now suspect that foul play is involved in and have declared the little girl's disappearance a crime.

In a written statement a few days before Christmas, Mr 
DiPietro said he had 'no idea what happened to Ayla or who is responsible.'

He said his family and friends would do 'everything we can to assist in this investigation and get Ayla back home.'

'I would never do anything to harm my daughter. She’s the world to me.'

The girl's mother Trista Reynolds has previously criticised her former partner for not pleading publicly for his daughter's safe return.

It has now been two weeks since Ayla disappeared from her bed in the house in Maine where she was staying with her father.

Police announced that the search for 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds had become a 'criminal investigation'.

Police say that both parents are co-operating fully with their work.

According to Scott Bernstein, 
founder of Child Recovery International, an organisation that helps find
missing children, the most likely time to find such young children is 
in the first few hours after their disappearance.

In Ayla's case, he said, there is 'one per cent hope - but I'll go for that one per cent hope'.

Police said on New Year's Eve that they 
suspected foul play in the disappearance, as Waterville police chief 
Joseph Massey announced that the case 'has evolved from the search for a
missing child to a criminal investigation.'

He
added that the investigation - which will be led by state police - was 
based on evidence that has been gathered over the past two weeks.

'All
of our efforts continue to locate Ayla,' said a spokesman for the Maine
Department of Public Safety.

'Although this is beginning of the third 
week, we remain hopeful.'

Before
she vanished, Ayla was wearing green polka dot pyjamas with the words 
'Daddy's Princess' on them.

She had her left arm in a cast after she had broken it in an accident.

Extensive
searches of woods, waterways, fields and private properties around 
Waterville, a city of 16,000 residents 20 miles north of the state 
capital Augusta, have failed to turn up anything.

The
day after Christmas, investigators announced a $30,000 reward, the 
largest ever for a missing-person case in Maine, for information leading
to Ayla's whereabouts.

There
were news reports at the weekend that two cars seized from the home were 
returned to Mr DiPietro and an unidentified woman, but a police 
spokesman declined to confirm those reports.

Investigators
put up crime scene tape at the father's home last week.

Outside the 
home a pile of teddy bears and stuffed animals were piled at a makeshift
tribute.

Ayla was placed in her father's care while her mother was in a substance abuse rehab programme, which she has now completed.

Ms Reynolds, making a televised appeal last Thursday, said that she had questions for Mr DiPietro but that he had not returned her calls since their daughter went missing.

She previously raised concerns about Ayla's treatment by her father after the girl broke her arm, which police said happened in an accidental fall.
