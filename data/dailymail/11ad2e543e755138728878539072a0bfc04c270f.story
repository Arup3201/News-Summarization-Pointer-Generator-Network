If you thought that serial diver Luis Suarez had the last word in football simulation, then think again.

Trinidad and Tobago Under 20 star Akeem Humphrey someone managed to commit two serious fouls before performing a defiant example of playacting not seen on a football pitch since Rivaldo confused his knee with his face at the 2002 World Cup.

During a game against Panama in the Concacaf U20 Championship at the weekend, Humphrey managed to twice elbow the same opponent in the face... before tumbling to the ground as if he were the victim of his own crime.

The Trinidad and Tobago U20 star elbows his opponent twice in one movement

The final elbow leaves the Panama player sprawling towards the ground

Humphrey's reaction is to feign injury himself by acting if he had been struck in the face

Humphrey went down but the referee was not fooled and sent him off before Trinidad and Tobago lost the game

Fortunately, the referee was not prone to poor performances and duly sent off Humphrey - reducing Trinidad and Tobago to nine men after Kadeem Corbin had earlier received his marching orders.

Panama maintained their 100 per cent record in the tournament by winning the match 1-0.
