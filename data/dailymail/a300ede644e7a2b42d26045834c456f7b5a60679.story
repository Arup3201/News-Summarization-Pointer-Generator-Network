A girl of 17 who had her identify stolen at the age of three was left in financial hell after fraudsters racked up $700,000 of debt in her name.

Criminals used the social security number of Caitlin Hemmerle to go on a spending spree that included three mortgages and a string of cars.

They also took out more than 42 credit cards or other accounts in the name of the Scottsdale, Arizona, girl - without her even realising.

Upset: Criminals used the social security number of Caitlin Hemmerle to go on a spending spree that included three mortgages and a string of cars

Over the years the debt totalled $600,000 in mortgages and $100,000 in car loans and credit cards.

Miss Hemmerle only became aware of their activities when her parents asked a private company to run a credit report on her - even though she is just 17.

They filed a police report and were able to close down all but one of the accounts, although her credit score has still not recovered.

The case is the latest instance of ID thieves targeting children and babies for identity theft, leaving them with what one parent has called a ‘financial birth defect’.

Using simple software they can predict their social security numbers numbers, in some cases before the children are even born.

Fraudsters consider these to be a ‘blank cheque’ as nobody ever suspects until it is too late.

Children as young as two have been left ‘bankrupt’ whilst those just a few years older receive a shocking surprise when they go to apply for their first credit card.

Being left with low credit scores means they are unable to get a loan, a mortgage or in some cases even a bank account.

An investigation by NBC’s Today show took up Miss Hemmerle’s case and tracked down one of the men who allegedly defrauded her to Arizona.

When one was confronted him with the 
allegation he had fraudulently taken out $500,000 in loans he initially 
claimed he did not understand but then said: ‘Why I see no cops?’

'It burns me up. He (the thief) can walk around living on my child’s social and nothing’s being done about it'

A
second suspected thief denied taking out more than $35,000 in debts. Asked if he had anything to say to his alleged victim he said: ‘I don’t 
know’.

Fighting back the tears Miss Hemmerle told NBC how it had affected her and said: ‘It’s not fair’.

Her father added: ‘It burns me up. He (the thief) can walk around living on my child’s social and nothing’s being done about it’.

ID theft is on the rise in America - In 2009 11.1million people were victims, up from 8.4 million in 2004.

One in ten Americans are thought to have had their identities stolen with each losing an average of $5,000.

The total cost to the US is estimated at $54billion, but worldwide it adds up to a staggering $221billion each year.

Getting your life back can also be a long and complicated process.

According to consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research each ID theft victim spent an average of 59 hours last year recovering from the incident, up from 41 hours in 2009.

'Children's Social Security numbers are uniquely valuable because they're essentially a clean slate for an identity thief'

Victims often have to spend lengthy periods on the phone to their bank or go to branches to present documents - only to find it is happening all over again.

Miss Hemmerle only discovered that she was the victim of ID Fraud when her parents asked for a scan by identity protection company AllClear ID.

The firm then advised her how to get the money back and stop it happening again.

‘Children's Social Security numbers are uniquely valuable because they're essentially a clean slate for an identity thief,’ said Jamie May, chief investigator with AllClear ID.

‘A thief can pair a child's Social Security number with any name, date of birth or address and create a new identity.

‘The best advice to parents is to check for misuse of their child's information early, before they run into problems like Caitlin's’.
