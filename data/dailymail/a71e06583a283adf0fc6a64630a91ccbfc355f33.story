Harrowing 911 calls made in the immediate aftermath of fatal shooting of a young lawyer Christmas shopping with his wife raise the possibility it may have taken the ambulance longer to get to him than authorities have admitted.

In the recordings released to the New Jersey Star Ledger on Monday, frantic Jamie Schare Friedland can be clearly heard screaming to the 911 dispatcher that she had been waiting 30 minutes for the ambulance she called for her husband and it still had not arrived.

This is in direct contradiction of claims made by Milburn, New Jersey, Police Chief Gregory Weber who said that the ambulance for critically wounded Hoboken attorney Dustin Friedland arrived at the mall parking lot 18 minutes after he was shot in the head by carjackers.

Tragedy: Friedland and his wife Jamie, who married in 2011, had been looking forward to starting a family together in the near future

'Yes this is an emergency. I'm at the Short Hills mall parking lot. My husband has been shot,' Friedland screams after a dispatcher answers her call after 9pm on December 15 after the pair had returned to their Range Rover after shopping in Short Hills mall.

'We called an ambulance a half an hour ago where is it?'

The dispatcher tries to claim that the ambulance is on site, but an audibly distressed Friedland says this is not true.

'They're on their way,' the dispatcher says according to the tapes from the New Jersey Star Ledger.

'When? When? When?' Friedland replies. 'Give me a time!' 

Investigation: Police at the scene where Dustin Friedland was fatally shot in front of his wife as two men carjacked their Range Rover SUV in a parking garage

Terror: One of the attackers entered the vehicle and ordered Friedland's wife out of the car at gunpoint

Horrific: Friedland was rushed to a New Jersey hospital on Sunday evening after he was shot in the head during an apparent carjacking in the parking garage of an upscale shopping mall

Dustin Friedland, 30, was fatally wounded by a gunshot to his head when two men approached him and his wife after an evening of Christmas shopping and demanded the keys to his 2012 silver Range Rover at gunpoint.

The successful lawyer resisted and one of the men shot Friedland in the head after a brief struggle and then forced his wife out of the SUV.

He died hours later at the Morristown Medical Center.

Millburn Police Chief Gregory Weber has said the ambulance actually arrived at the mall 18 minutes after the shooting, but the vehicle had trouble getting to the crime scene because it could not fit below a low ceiling at the entrance to the parking deck.

Eventually, emergency crews wheeled a stretcher up the entrance ramp to the level of the parking deck where Friedland was shot, Weber said.

Torn apart: Dustin Friedland, 30, was returning with his wife Jamie to their Range Rover after a Sunday night shopping spree when he was fatally shot

Grieving widow Jamie Schare Friedland buried her husband just days after he was fatally shot in front of her during a carjacking at an upscale New Jersey mall on Sunday

Four men — Karif Ford, 31, Basim Henry, 32, Kevin Roberts, 35; all of Newark; and Hanif Thompson, 29, of Irvington — have been charged in connection with the crime. All have pleaded not guilty.

At her husband's funeral three days after his shooting, his 27-year-old wife remembered Friedland as a man full of integrity and chivalry, who always insisted on carrying packages and heavy things for her.

‘Dustin was the most chivalrous person. He would run to make sure he opened for car door for me. There wasn’t a bag anyone ever carried that Dustin didn’t help with.’

‘Dustin always did the right thing,’ she added.

The last of six speakers during the service, Jamie told mourners that despite her loss, ‘I’m truly the luckiest person I know, and I still believe that because I married the best man in the entire world.’

‘I was lucky enough to be with him in the time we had,’ she said. The couple, who married in 2011,  had been hoping to start a family before the tragic incident.

‘There was not a better person, a better soul, in the entire world. He was my entire world and my happiness was the most important thing to him, always.’

‘He was kind, generous, giving, smart, loving, loyal, just the best person you ever met,’ she added.

‘Dustin, I love you more than anything in the entire multiverse,’ she said, standing just feet from the closed casket.

‘You are my everything, my hero. And I’m so proud to have known you, loved you and married you.’

Friedman's silver Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack on December 15

Dustin was shot in the head on Sunday night in front of his wife in the parking garage of The Mall At Short Hills, about 10 miles west of Newark, after being confronted by two carjackers.

According to authorities, he apparently resisted handing over the keys to his silver 2012 Range Rover.

Hanif Thompson, 29, Karif Ford, 31, Basim Henry, 32, and Kevin Roberts, 33, are accused of shooting Dustin Friedland outside The Mall at Short Hills on December 15.

In court: Two men, Hanif Thompson, 29, (left) 
and Kevin Roberts, 33, (right). accused of murdering a New Jersey man 
during a carjacking last month appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded 
not guilty to the charges

Charged: Basin Henry, 32, left, and Karif Ford, 31, right, also pleaded not guilty to the charges on Wednesday

The four men were arraigned on charges of murder, felony murder, carjacking, conspiracy, possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose on Wednesday.

Their public defenders entered not-guilty pleas for the men, who have been in custody since their arrests about a week after the shooting.

A state Superior Court judge in Newark continued their bail at $2 million each.

The carjackers confronted the pair and Friedland was shot in the head, authorities said. His wife was unharmed.
