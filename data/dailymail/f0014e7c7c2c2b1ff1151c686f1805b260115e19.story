It's official: The Bermuda Triangle is a myth.

After decades of speculation that aliens, black-hole vortices and evil Atlantis influences were responsible for the disappearance of dozens of ships and planes in the 'Devil's Triangle', the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has set the record straight. 

The U.S. government agency claims that foul weather and poor navigation are likely to blame for any mishaps in the area between Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico.

'There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean,' the agency stated on its website this month. 

The Bermuda Triangle: Dozens of ships and planes have mysteriously vanished in this area between Miami, Puerto Rico and Bermuda, but authorities blame poor navigation and bad weather

Ben Sherman, spokesman for NOAA's National Ocean Service, told Sun Sentinel the agency wrote the story as part of an educational program where it responds to readers' questions.

Their comments are based on 'scientific evidence' from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Guard which don't 'recognize the existence of the so-called Bermuda Triangle as a geographic area of specific hazard to ships or planes.

'In a review of many aircraft and vessel losses in the area over the years, there has been nothing discovered that would indicate that casualties were the result of anything other than physical causes,' the military branch said.

The mystery of Flight 19: Five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers carrying 14 men for a training exercise disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle no December 5, 1945. The aviation mystery sparked the 'myth' of the 'Devil's Triangle

According to Gizmodo, The Bermuda Triangle’s bad reputation started with Christopher Columbus's October 8, 1492, log in which he noted weird readings in the area. 

But it wasn't until the 1950s that some of the more outrageous theories and superstitions emerged.

The legend kicked off after an article written by Edward Van Winkle Jones was published by the Associated Press.

Jones reported several incidences of disappearing ships and planes in the Bermuda Triangle, including five US Navy torpedo bombers that vanished on December 5, 1945, and the commercial airliners 'Star Tiger' and 'Star Ariel' which disappeared on January 30, 1948 and January 17, 1949 respectively.

He said about 135 individuals were unaccounted for and they all went missing around the Bermuda Triangle, 'swallowed without a trace.'

Tragic: Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and five other passengers vanished without a trace while flying from the islands of Los Roque to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas on January 4 last year. The area has been compared to the Bermuda Triangle

Cursed: Baffled investigators have heard that Missoni has fallen victim to the 'Los Roques Curse', a paranormal phenomenon said to be similar to that of the Bermuda Triangle

In January last year, Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and five other passengers went missing while flying from the islands of Los Roque to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas.

It was claimed they were victims of the 'Los Roques Curse', a paranormal phenomenon that has been compared to the notorious Bermuda Triangle.

NOAA doesn't believe in such myths.

The agency claims there many other reasonable explanations, such as methane gas erupting from ocean sediments and overwhelming vessels.

NOAA also contends that hurricanes and tropical storms, which frequently churn through the triangle, are more likely explanations for ships or planes getting into trouble

'The ocean has always been a mysterious place to humans, and when foul weather or poor navigation is involved, it can be a very deadly place,' NOAA said. 'This is true all over the world.'
