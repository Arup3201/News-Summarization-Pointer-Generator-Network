Hilary Duff and George Lopez have joined a celebrity hunt for one of Hollywood's most well-known dogs.

Surveillance footage has emerged of Charlie, a white Maltese who often sits outside clothing store Switch, being snatched by a passing pregnant woman on Wednesday.

After posting a missing sign in her window, Charlie's owner Julia Cohen, who runs switch, was met with immediate celebrity backing.

Posting a picture of the missing canine to her Instagram account, Duff wrote: 'PLEASE HELP US FIND CHARLIE!!!! 

'He is missing. Last seen being picked up by a pregnant woman and her son. 

'White Maltese. Red collar. Please call!!(310) 860-1650! Or contact @switchboutique'

She told KABC: 'Charlie's a staple here. Everyone in Beverly Hills knows him. He sits outside the front of the store. He never ventures too far to the left, to the right.'

The moment he went: At first Charlie is seen ambling along his normal stretch of road on Beverly Drive

Snatched: This is the moment a woman in a yellow shirt is spotted picking up Charlie and walking off with him

Missing: Lopez shared a picture of the missing poster in a desperate bid to locate Charlie 

'There are a lot of broken hearts tonight,' Duff added. 

Comedian George Lopez took his appeal to Twitter.

He spoke to KABC from the store saying: 'Hilary Duff's covering one side of town and George Lopez is covering the other.'

The surveillance video posted on Twitter by Hilary Duff shows a woman, who witnesses say appeared to be pregnant, with a school-age child following the Maltese around a corner.

The pair then emerge holding Charlie and walking off.
