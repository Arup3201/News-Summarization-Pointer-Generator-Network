Jonathan Martin, 24, who left the Miami Dolphins in October and accused teammates of violently harassing him, will not return to the field this season.

The National Football League team Saturday said Martin had been placed on the ‘reserve/non-football illness’ list, making him ineligible to return until next season.

Martin's attorney has said Martin, a tackle, was taunted and abused by teammates, one of whom physically attacked him.

'Bullied': Jonathan Martin, 24, will not be returning to the filed this season, it was announced Saturday

The Dolphins suspended lineman Richie Incognito, 30, who has acknowledged using the ‘n-word’ and violent language in messages to Martin.

Incognito has said Martin is his friend. He said coarse language is a part of the locker room culture. He is appealing his suspension.

This comes only two weeks after Martin spent nearly seven hours 
explaining 'in great detail' his claims of the harassment he suffered in
 the Miami Dolphins locker room to NFL investors.

After the meeting, Martin announced that he plans to continue his career in the NFL.

Martin
 met with league officials and NFL investigator Ted Wells to 
discuss the alleged bullying he suffered at the hands of teammate Richie
 Incognito - and others - that ultimately led to his leaving the team 
last month to seek treatment for depression.

Following
 the meeting, the 6-foot-5, 312 pound Martin declined comment on the 
details of the meeting, only saying that he planned to return to 
professional football.

A lawyer for Martin has revealed shocking details about the bullying he suffered at the hands of teammates, including a racist 
voice mail message from fellow player Richie Incognito, who has been 
suspended.

Lawyer David Cornwell said in a statement that along with Incognito calling Martin a 'half-n*****' in a voicemail, another unidentified player threatened to rape Martin's sister.

Part of the violent and vulgar threat, directed at Martin's sister, included the words: 'She loves me. I am going to f*** her without a condom.'

Martin's lawyer did not specify to ESPN
 whether the words were said to Martin or if it was a voice-mail or 
text. He also claimed that the player had suffered a 'malicious physical
 attack'.

Uncertain future: Just two weeks ago, Marin said he planned to continue in the NFL. Now, after Saturday's announcement, his plans might fall through

The statement continues: 'Jonathan
 endured harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room 
hazing. For the entire season-and-a-half that he was with the Dolphins, 
he attempted to befriend the same teammates who subjected him to the 
abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment.

'This
 is a textbook reaction of victims of bullying. Despite these efforts, 
the taunting continued. Beyond the well-publicized voice mail with its 
racial epithet, Jonathan endured a malicious physical attack on him by a
 teammate, and daily vulgar comments such as the quote at the bottom. 
These facts are not in dispute.'

The
 NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith said that he had been in touch with Dolphins' players and said that 
every player deserves safe and professional working conditions.

Incognito, told a local TV reporter that he was 'just trying to weather the storm right now' as reports have emerged that he may have been under orders to 'toughen up' Martin

After leaving the team last month, 
Martin briefly checked himself into a South Florida hospital to be 
treated for emotional distress.

Incognito
 was reportedly told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin when he subjected
 his teammate to abusive voice mail and texts messages.

It
 has been revealed that after Martin missed two days of organized team 
activities (OTAs) last spring, coaches encouraged Incognito, the 
offensive line's undisputed leader, to 'get [Martin] into the fold'.

Just

 days later Incognito left a threatening, and racially offensive 
voicemail in which he called Martin, who is bi-racial, a ‘half n*****,’ 
threatened to slap his mother across the face and uttered the words 
‘I'll kill you.’

Martin's agent said the second-year player from Stanford was harassed 
almost daily by teammates in his rookie year and the hazing continued 
into this season.

That 
prompted an NFL investigation, and the Dolphins suspended Incognito, who
 sources said sent Martin threatening and racist messages during the 
off-season.

Commissioner Roger Goodell appointed a New York lawyer with experience in sports cases to investigate the case.

Dolphins'
 players have rallied passionately defended Incognito and insisting they
 didn't see the blowup coming. Most said Martin and Incognito were 
friends.

'I don't know why 
he's doing this,' offensive tackle Tyson Clabo said. 'And the only 
person who knows why, his name is Jonathan Martin.'

Guard John Jerry said he never heard Incognito use the racist term included in one voicemail and wouldn't have objected anyway.

'I
 would have just laughed it off,' Jerry said. 'I know the type of person
 he is, and I know he doesn't mean it that way. Everybody's got friends 
that when you're out, they say those type of things. It's never made a 
big deal.'

Was Incognito under orders? It isn't clear whether the instructions to 'toughen up' Martin came from head coach Joe Philbin, pictured, or another coach

The 30-year-old 
Incognito was kicked off his team at Nebraska, and has long had a 
reputation as one of the NFL's dirtiest players. But he has been 
universally praised by his teammates this week.

'Does he like to give guys a hard time? Yes. Does he like to pester guys and have fun? Yes,' Tannehill said.

'But
 he brought a lot of laughter to this locker room, he brought a lot of 
cohesiveness to this locker room and he was the best teammate that I 
could ask for.'

For Martin,
 the final straw was a lunchroom prank at the team complex, and he then 
left the squad. Tannehill and Jerry said the same prank has been pulled 
on many other players.

Hijinks are especially common among the offensive linemen, Clabo said.

'We
 have a system of basically it's just a big joke, basically,' he said. 
'It helps camaraderie. It keeps things light in the room. Everyone 
participates. No one is exempt and so I don't see how ... we would all 
be guilty of bullying.'

Tannehill said he was shocked when Martin departed.

He
 added: 'The whole thing, it's kind of mind-blowing to me. It's kind of 
mind-blowing to most of the guys on our team right now.

'It's tough for me, because you can't help a situation that you didn't know existed - that no one on this team knew existed.

'We
 have a bunch of good guys in this locker room. To be put in a situation
 where everyone's attacking the locker room saying it's such a bad 
place, such a bad culture, no leadership to stand up and stop the 
situation - no one knew there was a situation to be stopped.'
