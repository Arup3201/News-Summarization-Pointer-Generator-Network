A frustrated resident fed up with endless roadworks has defaced a 'men at work' road sign to show a contractor sitting down drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette.

Neighbours in Melksham, Wiltshire, have endured months of delays around the town because of ongoing engineering works.

So one cheeky amateur 'artist' decided to vent his feelings on the matter by adapting the sign to show a lazy labourer sitting down enjoying a hot drink and a cigarette.

Men at rest: A cheeky resident in Melksham, Wiltshire, has defaced a road sign to show a worker sitting down with a coffee and cigarette

Lib Dem councillor Jon Hubbard said: 'Melksham has had a lot of road works taking place and there has been a lot of annoyance at how long it is taking.

'It doesn't come across as a shock that someone has done this, it is a real problem in the town with roadworks seemingly taking forever.

'I've seen a lot of workers sitting around and I've raised the issue.

'Recently there was a case when workers were re-doing a road and there were terrible problems. Lanes were closed but there was no one doing any work.

Other amateur artists have adapted 'Stop' signs and 'Watch for ice' signs to reference popular music

Satirical statement: An amusing message offers some sound advice to pedestrians in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.

'They certainly haven't been given the appearance of being hard at work.'

It is not the first case in which creative members of the public have had a go at adapting street signs.

Other examples include a humorous sign-writer directing drivers to a 'Secret Nuclear Bunker' and another advising pedestrians, 'Don't walk in front of moving traffic.'

Several would-be comedians have chosen to make additions to 'Stop' signs, with one writing the musician John Mayer's name underneath, and another writing in 'Hammertime' to complete the famous MC Hammer lyric.

At times, it is the sign-makers themselves who have made the errors and horrified observers by misspelling simple words such as 'School Crossing' or 'Hospital'.
