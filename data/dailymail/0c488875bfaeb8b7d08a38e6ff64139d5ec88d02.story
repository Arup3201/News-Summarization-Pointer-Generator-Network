Manchester United began to sow the seeds of change as their 100-strong entourage flew to the USA on Friday.

As Louis van Gaal took his new players, Wayne Rooney included, off to Los Angeles, the diggers moved in at the club’s Carrington training base to herald the start of a new era.

The demanding Dutchman has signalled the go-ahead for first-team training pitches to be ripped up and replaced with a new surface: the Desso grassmaster surface that is in place at Old Trafford, and used at Wembley. It is a hybrid of grass and synthetic fibres.

Further changes are expected with plans for trees and  double fences to act as wind-breaks around the complex.

The idea, to also help with privacy, has been mooted for months but Van Gaal has been quick to assert work should be carried out.

Signs of his no-nonsense approach were  evident yesterday, with misfits Anderson and Bebe among those left behind.

Bebe hopes to join Benfica while Anderson, on loan at Fiorentina last season, picked up a calf injury in training but will leave if a buyer is found.

Van Gaal has cut youngsters Tom Lawrence, Davide Petrucci, Tom Thorpe, Andreas Pereira and Nick Powell from the USA travelling party. They will all be used in friendlies at home.

The 62-year-old had also ordered Friday’s flight from Manchester to be moved back to a later take-off, from 1pm to 3pm, to let the squad gather at Carrington.

They met at 10.30am to allow some light testing for the remaining England World Cup contingent of Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling before lunch and the 1pm coach to the airport.

As well as Van Gaal and his players, almost 80 extra staff were on the flight. The land of opportunity and commercial revenue means business for United and income is vital, particularly if the team miss out on competing in Europe again. The corporate demands that so shocked former  manager David Moyes last summer need due attention.

Van Gaal acknowledged this in a message to supporters yesterday. ‘I am very proud to be here,’ he said. ‘I hope I fulfil your expectations.

‘I have heard the season tickets are already sold out, I am very pleased.

‘I hope you support your team always, not only when we are winning but when we are losing, because we are winning together and we are losing together.’

The Red 
Devils will play four matches in the US beginning with David Beckham's 
former club.
