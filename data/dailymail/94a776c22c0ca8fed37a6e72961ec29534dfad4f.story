Physicist Stephen Hawking has become the latest celebrity to take part in the ice bucket challenge craze - but delegated the soaking to his children instead.

Mr Hawking - who himself has Motor Neurone Disease - was nominated by fellow scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson earlier this week.

He said a bout of pneumonia last year meant it was 'not wise' to accept the challenge personally, and instead enlisted the help of his children Lucy, 44, Timothy, 35, and Robert, 47.
