Message: Prep school headteacher Mark Brearey has asked parents to 'avoid bringing any party invitations into school that do not include all children'

A headmaster has told parents to invite the whole class when their child has a birthday party – to avoid upsetting those left out.

Mark Brearey says including only a smaller circle of friends is ‘divisive and unkind’ to other pupils.

A letter from the private mixed preparatory school to parents says its Christian ethic is about being inclusive.

But yesterday critics said his policy would only drive up the cost of children’s parties.

Mr Brearey, head of Kingswood Preparatory School in Bath, wrote a letter to parents in which he asked: ‘Please could you avoid bringing any party invitations into school that do not include all children in a particular class or year group. This goes completely against our policy of inclusion for every single child and is divisive and unkind.’

Parents criticised the decision, with several using Facebook to call it ‘ridiculous’. Michela Helen Mills said: ‘I think children should be allowed to hand out invites and the head teachers should bear in mind that not all parents can afford to invite the whole class – some classes have 20+ in each class.’

Joanne Oliver said: ‘Kids should invite their friends in numbers the parents have budgeted for. Why invite a kid who’s been harassing you at school all term?’

Jo Whittock added: ‘Most parents do a party on a budget so cannot afford to invite all in the class. Also if you have a theme party you are sometimes limited to a certain number. Kids have to learn that they can’t have everything.’

But several parents came to Mr Brearey’s defence.

Nicholas Roper said: ‘He’s not forcing parents to host 30+ kids, just don’t hand out the invites at school.

‘Teaching kids is hard enough without extra drama in the classroom.’ Yesterday Mr Brearey said he stood by his decision, which was designed to prevent children who are left out feeling upset.

‘We consider kindness to be one of the key values of our school,’ he said.

‘What
we are saying is that actually handing over party invitations to some 
of the group in front of people is not the way we would like it to 
happen. 99.9 per cent of our parents are in total agreement with that.’

He
said that if parents wanted to invite just a few of their child’s 
friends, they should do it privately, adding: ‘Do it by email, not in a 
public place where you find one or two or three people are left.

‘If
children feel like they have been left out by one of the class it can 
have a serious impact and it is something that doesn’t need to happen. 
Why choose to exclude in a public context when you don’t need to?’

At the school yesterday, parents appeared to back the headmaster’s stance.

One, a mother of three who requested not to be named, said: ‘It is not nice to leave people out.

‘I
usually invite the whole class until they have really made close 
friends, but when they are older you just ring the other mums.’

A
mother of eight-year-old twins said parents understood the rule. ‘We 
just tell the children about the party outside of school. It would be 
too many to invite the whole class.’

The
school, which costs £19,818 a year for boarders and up to £10,602 year 
for day pupils, was opened by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, in 
1748 for the sons of Methodist clergymen.

It has 306 pupils aged three to 11 and ‘seeks to be a caring community based upon Christian principles’.
