She was sent to a home for unmarried mothers when she became pregnant with her first child at 18 and underwent a gruelling course of IVF to conceive again at 50.

Yet despite those two tough experiences Tina Malone says she would happily have another baby tomorrow.

The 51-year-old Shameless actress says that while her second daughter Flame, one, is gorgeous, she would love 
to have a boy.

'We have some embryos in Cyprus where we did our IVF and 
if I can talk my husband round we might go back,' she told the Metro.

'But we'll have to see 
what happens.'

Best known for playing Mimi Maguire in Channel 4 sitcom Shameless, Tina first fell pregnant at 17 and refused to give up her daughter for adoption.

So she was sent away to a Catholic home for unmarried mothers on her father's instruction.

'It was 1981 but it was like something from the 1950s,' says Tina, who was eventually allowed home by her parents.

'There isn't an ideal time to have a child but this time was right for me in terms of where I am financially, emotionally, physically - in every way,' she says.

Tina reveals her eldest daughter Danielle, 32, was apprehensive when her mother said she was going for IVF.

'She was worried about my health. Now she's besotted with her new sister, Flame,' says Tina.

Tina has starred in a TLC documentary called Tina Malone: Pregnant at 50, and also presented one-moth-old Flame to the public on ITV's This Morning.

Accompanied by her young husband Paul Chase, 31, the pair chatted to the hosts of the show about welcoming their daughter.

She gave birth to Flame two weeks ahead of her New Year's Eve (December 31) due date, and later tweeted: 'Proud to announce the arrival of our BABY GIRL,cant wait to spend xmas as a family.xxxx.'

Her autobiography, Back In Control (Sphere), is out now.
