Dale Bolinger is accused of grooming someone he believed was a 14-year-old girl in an online chatroom, where he talked of cannibalism and sexual fantasies

A 'fantasist' nurse with a cannibalism fetish who is accused of sexually grooming a 14-year-old girl online is 'more Walter Mitty than Hannibal Lecter', his lawyer told jurors.

Dale Bolinger, 58, arranged to meet the girl via a fetish website after telling her he would kill her with an axe and then eat her, Canterbury Crown Court has heard.

Father-of-three Bolinger bought the axe from a DIY store in Broadstairs, Kent, the day before he planned to meet the Mexican girl called 'Eva' who was living in Hamburg, Germany.

Before retiring to consider their verdict today, jurors heard details of Bolinger's alleged attempt to meet the girl.

They were told that the night before their planned meeting, Bolinger - who worked as a registered nurse at nearby Margate hospital - told her: 'Got the axe, you ready to get that train?'

'Eva', whose true identity has never been uncovered, failed to show up at Ashford International Station and Bolinger was later arrested after graphic chat logs on the Dark Fetish Network (DFN) were uncovered.

Under cross-examination today, Bolinger said he had been 'stupid' and made 'very serious mistakes' but that he had not intended to kill or eat 'Eva'.

He told police he believed the person he was chatting to online was probably a man in his 30s 'surrounded by pizza boxes' who would be dead by his 40s.

And he said his motivation for going to Ashford International Station following their agreement to meet was out of concern for 'Eva', if she was in fact aged 14.

Bolinger told the court: 'I wasn't going to take off anyone's head. It would have been messy, it would have been horrible.'

In his closing speech, Bolinger's defence counsel Paul Jarvis said: 'We say that when you look at all the evidence, it's quite clear that Mr Bolinger is far more Walter Mitty than Hannibal Lecter.

'He is a fantasist and sometimes he goes too far and sometimes he stops, and sometimes - when the person encourages him - the fantasy continues.'

He urged the jury not to rely on the chat logs as evidence of truth. 

Mr Jarvis added: 'What happened here is obvious. There is a man, he might be 39, he may well be in Mexico and he may well have a fantasy about children or girls.

'But he hasn't got anyone to play with, so the way he gets his kicks is to pretend to be someone younger so that he can feed off someone else on the DFN.'

The court has been shown a 'selfie' picture Bolinger took before a planned meeting with the internet user, in which he shows off an axe he had bought from Homebase after discussing 'execution' online

Under cross-examination, Bolinger repeatedly denied that he believed 'Eva' was a 14-year-old girl, saying his intention in striking up contact with her was to 'feed into her fantasy'.

He told jurors: 'I was very stupid and I cannot deny that I have been very stupid and made very serious mistakes, but for those mistakes I have pleaded guilty.

'I didn't believe that it was a 14-year-old or a girl or a child at all. I thought it was an adult male.'

Prosecutor Martin Yale has said internet chats involving Bolinger on the DFN site about beheading and eating women and girls were discovered by the FBI in New York.

Investigators discovered the email address 'meatmarketman' was being used in Kent and Bolinger was arrested after the information was passed to Kent Police.

In chats with other users, Bolinger - who used a picture of supermodel Naomi Campbell on his profile - allegedly claimed to have eaten a 39-year-old black woman and a five-year-old child, Mr Yale told jurors.

His profile, under the name Chris C, listed his interests as 'cannibalism, mainly the hunting and preparation of young but sometimes not so young women', it is claimed.

Bolinger, who was working as a nurse around the time of the online chats, denies a charge of grooming

Referring to the graphic chat logs, Bolinger told the court: 'It was really about wanting to shock people...and seeing how far people wanted to go. In fact, I was running out of ideas.'

Bolinger said that had 'Eva' turned up at Ashford International Station, he would have taken her home and contacted social services.

Mr Yale suggested that he wanted there to be a meeting between them, but Bolinger replied: 'No I didn't, because if there was I would have been in real trouble.

'What I was hoping for was that she wouldn't turn up, and then I would go back and shout at her, and let her believe I was still interested.'

Bolinger, formerly from Canterbury, denies one charge of attempting to meet a girl under the age of 16 following sexual grooming in relation to 'Eva'.

Jurors have heard that Bolinger previously pleaded guilty to administering a poison or noxious substance after he put a cloth soaked in dry cleaning fluid over his friend Urlene King's mouth in July 2010.

He has also admitted one count of making indecent pseudo photographs of children, and seven counts of publishing an obscene article.
