Climbing the stairs can often become a struggle as you get older – even when you have four legs.

But it is no longer a problem for these three dachshunds after their owners bought them a £1,500 stairlift.

Sheila and Harry Lee installed the lift after one of the dogs, six-year-old Pippa, had to undergo a £5,000 operation on her spine.

Off to bed: Pippa, bottom, Heidi, top left, and Millie, top right, glide gracefully to bed in their £1,500 stairlift

They had been concerned about Pippa and their other dachshunds – Millie, seven, and Heidi six – straining their low-slung bodies as they negotiated the stairs to their beds.

‘We saw an advertisement for the stairlift and thought “Why not?”,’ Mrs Lee, 57, of Ossett, West Yorkshire, said yesterday.

Sheila Lee says she taught her pets to sit on the stairlift by giving them treats each time they did it properly

Hold on tight! The Lees' dachshunds are now a dab paw at sitting still on the lift as it carries them up and down

‘When the company we bought it from 
rang up a few weeks ago to see how we were getting on with it, they were
flabbergasted when I told them it was for the dogs.

'I bet they thought that I’d lost my marbles.

‘Dachshunds
often develop back problems and they were struggling to get up the 
steep steps into our bedroom, which is where they’ve always slept.’

She
and her husband, who used to run his own brewery, trained the dogs to 
sit on the lift seat by rewarding them with treats every time they used 
it correctly.

Sheila Lee, right with her pets, also uses a child's pram, left, to take her ailing dachshund Pippa for a walk

Mrs Lee, a
mother of four, said: ‘They soon began to enjoy the trips and they 
happily jump on the seat at bedtime, then take a ride downstairs in the 
morning. It is so comical.’

The dogs, adopted five years ago from West Yorkshire Dog Rescue, where she volunteers, are too heavy for her to carry upstairs.

‘The stairlift cost a fraction of the spine operation – and we might need to use it ourselves in a few years,’ Mrs Lee added.
