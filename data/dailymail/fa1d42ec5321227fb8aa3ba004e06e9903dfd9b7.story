Gigolo: Tim Blake-Bowell was found guilty of professional misconduct by the Teaching Agency. File picture

A gigolo PE teacher who was jailed for running a brothel after class was today found guilty of professional misconduct and now faces a potential lifetime ban from his profession.

Tim Blake-Powell, 51, pimped out six women - including his ex-wife - and also worked as a prostitute himself from a flat in the well-heeled cathedral city of Canterbury, Kent.

He was jailed for nine months in 2009 for running the brothel. He had moonlighted as a pimp while working as a teacher at the King Ethelbert School in Birchington, near Margate, Kent, between 2004 and 2007.

Yesterday Blake-Powell was found guilty of breaching the teaching code of conduct when he appeared at a disciplinary hearing of the Teaching Agency in Conventry.

The father-of-two was told his actions had placed him in 'direct contravention of the teaching code of conduct.

'The existence of this conviction surely undermines public confidence in the teaching profession and affects Mr Blake-Bowell’s ability to provide an effective learning environment for his pupils,' said presenting officer Mary Page.

'It is in direct contravention of section eight of the code of conduct, which state a teacher must maintain reasonable standards in his own behaviour, always trying to maintain an effective learning environment and maintaining public trust in the profession.'

Blake-Bowell had been a 'dedicated teacher' at the 700-pupil King Ethelbert School, a mixed comprehensive which takes children between 11 and 16, where he was fanatical about hockey and cricket, the panel heard.

But after work he sold his body and managed a team of six other prostitutes, including his then-wife Emma, 40, from a rented flat in Canterbury.

At his trial in 2009, Canterbury Crown Court heard Blake-Bowell was responsible for the financial affairs of the brothel, which was variously named 'Gem's', 'Pandora's' and 'Men For All Seasons'.

He paid the women they employed and took care of day to day tasks like bills and rent. While selling your body for money is not illegal in England, profiting from others' prostitution is.

Emma, 40, who had herself worked as an escort in the city since 2004, was in charge of the day-to-day running of the business.

She acted as a receptionist, worked out the girls’ rotas, introduced them to clients and also prostituted herself. The couple, who have two young children, split up after their arrest in December 2007.

Blake-Bowell admitted a charge of controlling prostitutes for financial gain in July 2009 and was jailed for nine months, but was released after serving just four months of his sentence.

His ex-wife Emma also pleaded guilty to the charge, but her nine-month sentence was suspended, with the judge saying she had been susceptible to pressure from her husband due to her vulnerable mental health.

Blake-Bowell, 47, paid £560 a month to rent the Canterbury flat and spent another £1,400 a month on advertising.

The brothel was staffed from 11am until midnight with the women charging £40 for a massage, £60 for 30 minutes of sex and £100 for a full hour.

Although the Blake-Bowells used only willing British women, their operation was uncovered during a Kent Police probe into illegal sex-trafficking from Eastern Europe.

At her trial Emma, who has two more children by a previous husband, was described as a working prostitute who called herself ‘Brandy’. She was also the brothel's 'meeter and greeter'.

Shortly after his arrest in December 2007, Blake-Bowell lost his job at King Ethelbert School, although he was allowed to stay on until the end of term.

At the time, school sources said they were astonished at his involvement, with one mother describing the sports master as a 'model teacher'.

Blake-Bowell shed tears as a statement from his former headmaster was read out describing him as a 'valued and trusted colleague' who had shown 'unstinting commitment to those pupils in his pastoral care'.

At the Teaching Agency panel today, chairman Dr Roland Kitchen said: 'We find Mr Blake-Bowell has been convicted of a relevant offence.

A decision on whether he will be banned from teaching for life is expected in two weeks time.

Blake-Bowell, who attended yesterday’s hearing confirmed he had given up teaching. He said: 'I have no plans to return to the profession.'
