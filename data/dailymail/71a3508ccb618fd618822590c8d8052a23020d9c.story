Luiz Felipe Scolari may have been unhappy with Brazil's approach to training recently, but Neymar could be an exception to the manager's anger.

Brazil's poster boy for the World Cup will feel the pressure of a nation when he lines up against Croatia for the tournament's opening game, but he certainly isn't showing it judging by his set-pieces.

Accuracy: Neymar elected for placement over power in scoring his free-kick

During a training session for the Selecao, the Barcelona striker clipped a delightful free-kick from 20 yards over a wall and into the top corner past a stranded keeper.

It's the latest trick in the 22-year-old's arsenal, following an outrageous penalty also in training where he fooled the goalkeeper with which foot he was going to take the spot-kick with.

Neymar's sweet set-pieces could prove crucial for Brazil during the World Cup, but Scolari clearly feels the host nation need more following a recent training session.

'When I don't like things,' said Scolari, 'I have to find a solution and field it on the pitch until I am satisfied.

'We have two friendlies and it is preferable to field him in either better or perfect conditions from the second match.'

Neymar won't be the only Brazilian capable of scoring from a dead ball though, as Sportsmail looks at other members of the squad who may be standing over a free-kick this summer.

Neymar's Barcelona team-mate will most likely be bombing down the flanks and trying to supply the striker with crosses at the World Cup, but the 31-year-old has previous in finding the back of the net from long range free-kicks.

Unpredictable: David Luiz's free-kicks often trouble keepers with their top spin

The Chelsea defender was once branded a Playstation footballer by Gary Neville, but his free-kicks are something straight off a games console, with the 27-year-old often catching keepers off guard with attempts containing plenty of top spin.

Controlling: Oscar's technique and skill have left many keepers fooled from free-kicks

And when Luiz doesn't get a go, his Chelsea team-mate Oscar is more than capable of stepping up. The midfielder scored a stunning free-kick against Stoke in the FA Cup last season, disguising his strike enough to beat Asmir Begovic at his nearest top corner.

Thumbs up from me: Hernanes can be just as accurate as Neymar in picking out a top corner

Hernanes

It's not just Neymar that can leave keepers rooted from free-kicks. Inter Milan's Hernanes can also find the postage stamp corners and it encouraged Inter Milan to snap up the midfielder from Lazio earlier this year.

Power: Hulk's long range free-kicks could be an asset for Brazil at the World Cup

For when skill and technique just isn't enough, Hulk can step up to the set-piece plate for Brazil with his powerful drives from long range proving an asset during his time at Porto.
