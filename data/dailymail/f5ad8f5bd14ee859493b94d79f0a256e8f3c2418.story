Manchester United full-back Rafael says Louis van Gaal's managerial record is proof he will be a success at Manchester United.

Van Gaal has experienced an indifferent start to life at Old Trafford, with United eight points off leaders Chelsea after seven games, but after back-to-back league wins they looked to have turned the corner.

And Rafael, who has been an ever-present for the Red Devils this season, believes Van Gaal - who has won titles with Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich – is the man to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.

He told the Manchester Evening News: 'Everything takes time. 'It's a different philosophy. If we understand the way we are playing like we are doing, the results come and everything starts to run smoothly, we certainly have a chance of winning the title.

'Louis Van Gaal is a strong coach. He admires things that are done right. He asks everybody to be on time for our sessions, we can't be late. He likes to see us training hard.

'So, he has some differences (to previous managers), especially in terms of his philosophy, and we need to be able to adapt to it. However it's must be right because the proof is the titles that he's won.'

United travel to West Brom on Monday night as they look for a third straight win to close the gap on Jose Mourinho's men at the top of the table.
