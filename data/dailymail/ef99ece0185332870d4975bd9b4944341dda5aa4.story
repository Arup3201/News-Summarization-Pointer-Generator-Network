World Cup TV host Gary Lineker said more in hope than expectation on the eve of Brazil 2014 that its biggest stars had to deliver.

He was well aware the most-hyped players in South Africa four years ago - Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Kaka, Fernando Torres and Robin van Persie - managed just two goals between them, and the entire World Cup had flopped as a result.

But, to the delight of Lineker and millions of armchair fans, this time has already been different – and how.

Biggest stage: Lionel Messi celebrating his goal that crucially put Argentina 2-0 up against Bosnia & Herzegovina at the Maracana on Sunday

Clincher: Mario Balotelli netting the header that gave Italy a 2-1 victory over England on Saturday

Local hero: Neymar celebrates with Brazil team-mate Hernanes after scoring the penalty that gave his side a 2-1 lead in the World cup opener against Croatia on Thursday

Time to shine: Now it is Cristiano Ronaldo's turn to deliver as Portugal prepare to face Germany

The greatest players in the world have set the stage alight in the first few days with brilliant goals from Neymar, Karim Benzema, Mario Balotelli, Messi, van Persie, Arjen Robben, and a midfield masterclass from Andrea Pirlo as Italy broke passing records against England.

If anything is going to get the current best player on the planet Cristiano Ronaldo in the mood as he makes his long-awaited first appearance in Brazil against Germany on Monday evening, it’ll be the sight of his peers getting so much acclaim and adulation in a stunning start to the tournament.

For all the talk of Messi’s attempts to emulate Diego Maradona this summer, Ronaldo has the ego to believe he should leave Brazil this summer as the greatest player of all-time by leading Portugal to their first World Cup – something even Eusebio couldn’t manage.

He’s had to overcome a torn thigh muscle and tendonitis in his knee in the build-up to the World Cup, in less than four weeks after helping Real Madrid win the Champions League.

But surely nothing will stop the £80million world footballer of the year trying to put on a special show in Portugal’s opening game in Group G against Germany in Salvador.

Ronaldo was actually applauded into the media room as he finally arrived an hour late on Sunday to talk about the Germany clash. He tried to be modest but it didn’t really work.

Sprinter: Arjen Robben was also amongst the goals in their demolition of the world champions

‘I'm 100%,’ he assured them. ‘I'd like to be at 110%. If I'm not feeling well, I'm the first to tell the coach I can't play. If I feel anything during the match, I'm the first to tell the coach. I come first.

‘I can make a difference, but I can't carry the whole team. I just want to help. On Monday we have a match against a favourite to win the World Cup, Germany.

'Look at my statistics and my CV – I have nothing to prove. My career has been great so far and I just want that to continue.’

Until now the game’s biggest names haven’t let the World Cup down.

It started on opening night when Brazil’s No10 Neymar rescued the hosts after they trailed to Croatia, equalising with a shot that fizzed in-off the post and then scoring a match-winning penalty.

Struggle: Ronaldo and Messi had a difficult time of it at the last World Cup, with the Portuguese forward managing just a single goal against North Korea and the Argentine failing to score

Strife: Wayne Rooney had a terrible time of it in South Africa, failing to score in four appearances, whilst Kaka saw more red cards for Brazil than he managed goals

If that was impressive, what Robben and van Persie did to holders Spain on Friday was nothing short of sensational. They scored twice each – van Persie’s looped header will be talked about for years to come – as Holland won 5-1.

Over the weekend, it was more of the same. Mario Balotelli headed Italy’s winning goal against England – why is it always him?

At 35, Pirlo was man-of-the-match as Italy recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent, the highest ever in a modern World Cup game.

Benzema scored twice for France, and then Messi lit up the Maracana after a sluggish start with a tradsemark solo  slalom to score against Bosnia and Herzegovina in Argentina’s 2-1 victory.

Pass master: Andrea Pirlo recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent against England

All smiles: Ronaldo was in high spirits during a press conference ahead of the crucial opening game

Expectation: But he knows there will be real pressure on him to deliver the goods

It will be extremely difficult to top – but it’s Ronaldo up next and anything is possible.

He's the most expensive footballer in the world at £80million. He's the current world footballer of the year, ahead of Messi.

But taking the World Cup by storm would top it all and he knows it, regardless of the state of his body.
