One man shouted 'Rot in Hell, Holmes!' at movie massacre suspect James Holmes today after a judge delayed the alleged mass shooter's arraignment.

Steve Hernandez's daughter Rebecca Wingos was killed during the slaughter in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater last summer during a premiere of the new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises.

When Judge William Sylvester announced Holmes would not have to enter a plea on his charges of murder and attempted murder until March, the crowd of family and victims became noticeably angry.

And when the hearing ended, Hernandez yelled, 'Rot in hell, Holmes!'

Rage: Steve Hernandez, right, shouted in disbelief as the arraignment of his daughter's alleged killer, James Holmes, was put off for two months

The judge
reconvened the proceeding to talk to Hernandez, who apologized 
and promised there would be no more outbursts. The judge was 
sympathetic.

'I am terribly sorry for your loss and I can only begin to imagine the emotions that are raging,' Sylvester told him.

Sylvester ruled Thursday night that prosecutors had presented sufficient evidence at a preliminary hearing to proceed toward trial on charges that James Holmes killed 12 people and injured 70 others at a suburban Denver movie theater on July 20.

Sylvester had asked Holmes if he 
objected to the delay and defense attorney Tamara Brady answered for 
him, saying he did not.

Defense lawyers didn't say why they wanted to 
delay entering a plea.

One possible reason could be to 
seek a mental health evaluation by a doctor of their choosing. Lawyers 
for Holmes have said he is mentally ill, raising the possibility of an 
insanity defense.

If Holmes had entered an insanity plea today, an evaluation would be done by state doctors.

Prosecutors objected to the delay and said they were ready to move ahead.

Sylvester said he understood 
their position but wanted to make sure he did not do anything that could
lay the grounds for an appeal.

'We want to avoid at all costs doing anything improper,' the judge said.

Following the hearing, District 
Attorney George Brauchler, who took office this week, didn't 
specifically address the delay but said he wanted to 'protect the 
interests of all involved in this case.'

If Holmes, 25, is convicted of 
first-degree murder, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors have 
not said whether they would pursue that sentence.

Loss: Chantel Blunk, center, walks into court. Blunk's husband Jon was killed during the shooting.

The hearing capped an emotional 
week in which the public, including victims and their families, got the 
first look at evidence gathered against Holmes and heard police officers
describe attempts to save the wounded.

During the preliminary hearing, 
witnesses testified that Holmes spent weeks amassing an arsenal and 
planning the attack at a midnight showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises,' 
and that he took photos of himself hours before the shooting, including 
one that showed him grinning with a handgun.

They also detailed an elaborate 
booby trap set up at Holmes' apartment designed to explode at the same 
time the theater attack occurred several miles away.

Prosecution witnesses testified 
that Holmes began acquiring weapons in early May, and by July 6 he had 
two semi-automatic pistols, a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle, 6,200 
rounds of ammunition and high-capacity magazines that allow a shooter to
fire more rounds without stopping to reload.

Holmes' lawyers called no witnesses during the hearing.

Another possibility in the case 
is that either side could argue that Holmes is not mentally capable of 
assisting in his own defense. If that happens, the judge would order a 
mental competency evaluation. Sylvester also can order an evaluation if 
he has his own questions about Holmes' competence.

In the case of the Tucson, Ariz.,
shooting that killed six people and wounded 13, including then-Rep. 
Gabrielle Giffords, Jared Loughner was initially ruled incompetent to 
stand trial. However, after a year of treatment, Loughner was ruled 
competent, the case proceeded, and he entered guilty pleas.

If Holmes ends up pleading not 
guilty by reason of insanity, Sylvester would also order a psychiatric 
evaluation by doctors at the state hospital. A jury would consider that 
evaluation, along with testimony by expert witnesses, any other 
court-ordered evaluations and other evidence, in deciding at a trial 
whether Holmes is or is not guilty by reason of insanity.

If found not guilty by reason of 
insanity, Holmes would be committed to the state mental hospital for 
treatment. His case would be reviewed every six months. He conceivably 
could be released if he ever is deemed no longer insane.

"Insanity is what this case is 
going to turn on," said Denver criminal defense attorney Dan Recht. 
"This is not a whodunit case."
