Kim Kardashian has made no secret of her  frequent attempts to get pregnant with her second child.

Speaking on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the 34-year-old reality star said she was 'desperate' to conceive a sibling for baby North - to the point where she and Kanye were having intercourse multiple times per day. 

And now, one fertility expert has offered some insight into Kim's struggle, suggesting that the global star's hectic lifestyle may be to blame. 

Kim Kardashian, who is already mother to one-year-old North West, has said she is 'desperate' to conceive a sibling for her daughter... but one fertility expert says her hectic lifestyle may be to blame

Speaking to new! magazine, Mr Paul Serhal, Medical Director at CRGH, a leading fertility clinic in London, said: 'Kim should reduce her hectic lifestyle in order to increase her chances.'

Kim - who has been flying all over the world over fashion month, starring in shoots and tending to the needs of her one-year-old daughter - needs to take a break, says Mr Serhal.

'Flying is a common cause of infertility in high-profile, professional women because it can impact on the regularity of the ovulation cycle.

'Ovulation time is critical because women aren’t fertile throughout the whole month. This is another reason IVF could be a good option for Kim. You collect ten or 11 eggs and effectively pack one year of ovulation into one IVF cycle of treatment.'

Mr Serhal believes that thanks to her age, Kim, who has already proved she can conceive naturally,  would have a very good chance of getting pregnant with IVF.

He explains that women in their 30s - like Kim - have a 60 per cent chance of conceiving through IVF.

On the E! show, Kim was seen lying supine to allow Kanye's sperm to 'marinade' inside her.

'The doctors said I have to lie down for 1- minutes after sex...and I had sex just before you got here,' Kim said as her sisters groaned in disgust. 

'Lying flat after sex wont make any difference,' said Mr Serhal. 

Instead, he suggests that she should maintain a healthy  diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid prolonged exposure to heat to help her chances of falling pregnant with a little brother or sister for baby North.
