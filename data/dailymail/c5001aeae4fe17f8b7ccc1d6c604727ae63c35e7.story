Tottenham midfielder Lewis Holtby is to sign for Hamburg in a £5million deal, according to reports in Germany.

The 24-year-old left White Hart Lane for the Bundesliga side on loan this summer, but German newspaper Bild claim that the deal is now to be made permanent.

Holtby was originally only supposed to be at Hamburg on a temporary deal until the end of this season, but the club have met a number of terms in his contract that means a transfer can be completed.

The midfielder struggled to impress in 18 months at White Hart Lane

He signed for Tottenham in January 2013 from German side Schalke, but failed to make much of an impression in his 18 months in North London, scoring just three times in 42 appearances. 

And he spent the second half of last season on loan at struggling Fulham, scoring once in 13 Premier League games as they were relegated from the top flight.

Holtby also has three caps for Germany's national team after making his debut in 2010, although his most recent cap came in 2012 before he joined Spurs.
