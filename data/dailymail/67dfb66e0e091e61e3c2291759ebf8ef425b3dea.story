Too many women are being singled out for strip searches at Gatwick airport, an official report has discovered.

John Vine, the Government’s chief inspector of immigration, also found that especially numbers of Afro-Caribbean women are being searched.

Mr Vine studied the conduct of Border Force staff working in the immigration and customs departments at the airport’s North Terminal last summer.

The Government¿s chief inspector of immigration has found women are 'singled out' for strip searches at Gatwick Airport in West Sussex

He found irregularities in the way searches were conducted and that many searches were not properly recorded.

His report says: 'Although the majority of person searches involved men, women were significantly more likely to be subject to a strip search than men if a search was undertaken.'

His research revealed that 54 per cent of women who were stopped and inspected were later strip searched compared with only 20 per cent of men.

Reasons given by Border Force staff for strip-searching women were that they had bought a ticket only the day before travel, were carrying 200-pounds in cash or said they were visiting Britain to look for hair and beauty products.

Mr Vine said there were often 'insufficient grounds' for women even to be stopped in the first place and certainly not sufficient for a strip search to be conducted.

The report says: 'The failure to observe the correct recording procedure can render evidence inadmissible in court and mean officers could face charges of assault in relation to the conduct of person searches.'

The report reveals that a gay passenger was subject to discriminatory treatment because he was with a boyfriend and an officer believed 'he might be involved in paedophilia'.

It says: 'The officer then commented to another officer that the passenger was HIV positive. The colleague then advised that the searching officer should use stronger hand gel.

'These comments were made within earshot of the passenger and indeed other passengers in the channel.'

A Border Force spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that the inspector will not share details of the individual cases so that the Border Force can investigate and take further action as necessary.

'We have already addressed the Chief Inspector’s recommendations by introducing additional training for staff on issues of discrimination; we take discriminatory practice very seriously and have procedures in place to deal with any complaints.'

The Border Force is now believed to have carried out a shake-up in the way searches are recorded. Guidance issued to staff at airports at airports is also being rewritten.
