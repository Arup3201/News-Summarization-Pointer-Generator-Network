This camel could probably ask for some advice from hot-topic singer Miley Cyrus.

After all, popularity often comes with controversy.

A commercial starring a talking camel has received over 15 million hits on YouTube but has been labeled as 'disruptive' by teachers at a Connecticut school.

The popularity of Caleb, a 'talking' camel that stars in a TV ad for the Geico insurance company has created controversy in a Connecticut middle school

The Geico 'Hump Day' ad has many people laughing across America but teachers at Vernon Center Middle School in Vernon, Connecticut, would prefer to put the chatty camel in detention.

The problem?

Superintendent of Schools Dr. Mary P. Conway told WFSB that some sixth-grade boys at the school were impersonating the camel so much that teachers claimed it was disruptive.

'Everybody's walking around in the hallways and saying its hump day in that weird voice,' student Brooke Lewis said.

The issue got a bigger rise as some students began imitating the camel during the entire week and not just on Hump Day.

'Sometimes it's the counting down to when it is,' Lewis said.Â 

The television spot features a camel walking around an office annoyingly asking busy workers: 'Guess what day it is? Guess what day it is? Huh? Anybody?'

The ad - one of the most popular over summer - makes a play on the term 'Hump Day' which refers to Wednesday being the 'hump' in the middle of the working week.

The hook is that camels have humps and is a snappier line than, say, 'Dromedary Day' - especially for a camel that 'talks'.

The Geico gecko is a popular star of the insurance company's ads that now include a talking pig and controversial camel

The commercial was made for insurance 
provider Geico which has a track record for making quirky animals 
famous.

The company, which spends about $1 
billion a year on advertising, became well-known for using an urbane 
gecko with an English Cockney accent for some of its promotional 
material and has also used a pig and a caveman.

CBS News reported the concept was created by New York ad agency The Martin Agency.

Sean Riley, a creative director with the
 agency, said the idea of using a camel in an office was intended to 
make people pay attention to the ad.

'We were focused on doing something in 
the office and we were focused on doing something surprising and I said 
"camel" and it went from there,' Riley said.

The camel - named Caleb - impressed casting directors with its attitude to acting out in an office.

'We were impressed by his swagger,' said the ad's executive producer Molly Souter. 'He has a natural swagger.'

Yet concern from teachers in Connecticut about the talked-about ad is now getting kickback from students and parents.

'I don't really think it is that big of a disruption if people are just doing it in the hallways,' said student Jacob Ruggerio.

Jacob's father described the issue as 'silly'.

'I think there's bigger things to take care of in middle schools than that.' said Mick Ruggerio.

It was predicted the controversy would blow over by Wednesday.

'It is getting old now, the Hump Day thing, it is getting old,' said parent Beth Lewis.
