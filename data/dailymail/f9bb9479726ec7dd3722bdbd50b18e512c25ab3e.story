Air New Zealand has issued a stern warning to staff after a handful of employees created a scandal with a series of drunken episodes.

Four flight attendants resigned last week after a booze-fuelled night in Wellington reportedly led to one of the crew being recorded in an ‘intimate’ video.

In the wake of employees’ well-publicised exploits the airline has cracked down on drinking, punished those who breached its code of conduct and told remaining staff to be on their best behaviour.

Air New Zealand has been forced to deal with a series of incidents involving intoxicated employees

New Zealand’s flag carrier launched an investigation after the heavy drinking session came to light, the Herald on Sunday reported.

The flight attendants had dinner with two pilots during an overnight stop in the capital on 31 October and continued to drink after the pilots had left.

According to the newspaper, one became so drunk she reportedly had to be carried back to a hotel, and an ‘intimate’ video was recorded during the night.

The investigation culminated with the four being stood down before resigning for breaching the airline’s code of conduct.

In an unrelated incident, another employee resigned after failing a breath test before working on a flight.

Last month, the airline launched an investigation into reports that an intoxicated off-duty flight attendant ‘straddled’ All Blacks fullback Israel Dagg while she was a passenger on a plane.

Following an investigation the flight attendant was warned and allowed to return to work, and the airline said suggestions that an off-duty crew member performed ‘any kind of dance’ were incorrect.

After that incident management immediately stopped the consumption of alcohol for cabin crew working on short- and mid-haul flights.

In July, crew assigned to fly stranded passengers from Hawaii to Auckland were accused of drinking heavily and becoming unfit for duty if the plane had been airworthy, the Herald on Sunday reported.

Bruce Parton, the carrier’s chief operations officer, told the newspaper: ‘Regrettably over the past two months we have had two isolated incidents involving cabin crew who were not operating at the time.

‘As a result of these two isolated issues all cabin crew are being reminded of the standards expected of them.'
