Police searching for the body of murdered Suzanne Pilley have identified a key new search area.

The 38-year-old bookkeeper who disappeared in May 2010 on her way to work in her Edinburgh office was killed by her ex-lover David Gilroy who is serving a life sentence for her murder.

He has always refused to say what he did with Miss Pilley’s body but after an emotional appeal on BBC's Crimewatch by her heartbroken family fresh information means her remains may finally be found.

Missing: Suzanne Pilley, a 38-year-old bookkeeper, was murdered by her former lover David Gilroy who is serving a life sentence for her killing

A remote spot near Minard near Argyll, Scotland, is subject to a fresh, intensive police search in connection with Miss Pilley after a new witness came forward.

Police have moved into the area following claims from a witness who saw Gilroy's silver car on the main road between Lochgilphead and Inverary the day after she vanished.

The same witness also claims to have spotted Gilroy's Vauxhall Vectra at a quiet spot off the main A83 arterial route that runs through the area.

Suzanne Pilley's parents, Rob and Sylvia made an appeal for information on Crimewatch earlier this month

Last night, Police Scotland confirmed that they were looking at the site in Minard.

DCI Stuart Houston said: ‘The area of Minard, along with a number of areas in Argyll, did feature in the investigation.

‘Following the recent appeal on BBC's Crimewatch, officers have followed up on information that has been passed to police, which is subject to further investigation.’

Detectives believe Gilroy killed Suzanne Pilley in the basement of the Edinburgh building in which they worked but her body has never been found

Earlier this month, Miss Pilley’s heartbroken parents appealed on Crimewatch for Gilroy, 50, to reveal their daughter's final resting place.

Grief stricken Sylvia Pilley sobbed as she said: ‘Justice had been done, but we felt so sad after it because we weren't going to get her back. She's lying somewhere and nobody knows, as if nobody loved her.’

Gilroy was found guilty by majority verdict on 15 March 2012 of the murder of Suzanne Pilley and of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He was jailed for life, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 18 years.

The Crimewatch reconstruction led to a witness who saw Gilroy's silver car on the main road between Lochgilphead and Inverary the day after Suzanne Pilley vanished

The case made legal history when Gilroy became the first convicted killer to have his sentencing filmed for British TV.

During the investigation into her disappearance more than 200 searchers scoured 100,000 acres of land.

Their earlier hunt focused on the Argyll Forest, targeting Glen Croe, and an area known as Hell's Glen.Gilroy's trial heard that the day after Suzanne disappeared, he drove his Vectra to Lochgilphead, some 13 miles from Minard. He was then spotted near Lochgilphead High School buying black bin bags
