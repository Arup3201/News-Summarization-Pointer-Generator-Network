Stoke City have added Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic to their list of possible targets.

The Stuttgart frontman impressed for his national side in their brief spell at the World Cup in Brazil, scoring against Argentina - but Bosnia left the competition after finishing behind the South Americans and Nigeria.

Ivisevic has impressed Mark Hughes and the Welshman will now look to secure a deal to bring the 29-year-old to the Britannia.
