Schoolgirl Charlotte Cutt is almost dwarfed by the pumpkin she has nurtured from a seed.

However, it’s not only her green fingers which have helped it to swell to a 28-stone giant.  

The vegetable has been helped on its way by polyhalite, a super fertiliser from deep under the ground near her family’s home.

Massive: Charlotte Cutt, eight, grew the giant pumpkin from seed and has sold it to a restaurant for £100

Charlotte, eight, and her father Matthew, 40, wanted to test claims about the mineral’s potency – and the results were certainly dramatic.

Polyhalite is a naturally occurring mineral, often found in potash mines, and makes for an excellent all-purpose fertiliser because it contains potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium. 

Tens of thousands of pumpkins are rotting in the fields, prompting warnings of a shortage for Hallowe’en.

The recent heavy rain and humid conditions have caused ripening pumpkins to become scarred and mushy. 

It has also meant that the machinery used to harvest them gets stuck in the mud.

Rot has claimed up to 50 per cent of some crops in the key pumpkin-growing region of Lincolnshire. 

One of the largest growers in the county said: ‘There will be a huge shortage. I’m afraid a lot of children will have to go without pumpkins to carve this year.’

Father-of-two Mr Cutt said: ‘It’s so big, it just doesn’t look real and it’s a fantastic colour.

‘The good summer we had helped and it just grew and grew and grew. It’s absolutely brilliant.’

After sowing the seed indoors in April, they moved it outside and sprinkled the compost with crushed polyhalite every ten days or so.

Charlotte also watered the plant daily at their home in Sleights, North Yorkshire, but that’s all the help it received.

Mr Cutt, a lobster fisherman, and his wife Gillian, 44, managed to get hold of some blocks of local polyhalite to begin the DIY experiment.

The fruit began to form in July and grew...and grew. Mr Cutt said: ‘We didn’t know how big it was going to get – but it got bigger and bigger.’

It is Hallowe’en soon, however, and there’s no escape for the pumpkin. A restaurant has paid £100 for it and the money will go to a local school.

Plans to mine the local polyhalite, the highest grade potash in the world, face opposition as the deposits are in the North York Moors National Park.

A decision will be made next year. The world record for a pumpkin is 2,096 lbs (nearly 150-stone).
