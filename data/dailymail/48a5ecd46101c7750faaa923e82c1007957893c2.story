Across the Atlantic, the European horse meat scandal has swept the continent.

Millions of products were pulled from store shelves in Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway after the scandal broke.

On Friday, the European Union agreed to begin 
random DNA checks on meat products, while British authorities announced traces of horse had been found in school meals, restaurant dishes and hospital food, as well as supermarket products.

But a similar scandal is unlikely to happen in U.S., as the country no longer slaughters the animals or imports horse meat.

Also, according to ABC News, none of the companies or countries implicated in the labeling controversy actually export beef to the U.S.

William Hallman, director of the Food Policy Institute at Rutgers University, told ABC: 'It's difficult to say that it could never happen here, but it's a lot less likely.'

'The bottom line is that no horse meat is legally being slaughtered for commerce right now in the United States,' Hallman added.

Slaughtering or selling horses for meat was made illegal throughout the U.S. in 2006. Though the Congress ban was lifted in 2011, no states have yet resumed the practice.

Federal laws ensure that that a USDA inspector be present at all slaughterhouses to check on the safety, hygiene and labeling of carcasses.

Hallman says that even in states that had slaughtered horses before the ban, no money has been put forward to restart inspections.

Dave Arnold, a food safety expert at the International Culinary Center in New York told ABC that: 'Unless you have a USDA inspector in a meat processing plant, you can't sell that meat legally,' he said.

But despite the USDA checks Arnold admits that horsemeat could still enter the food supply fraudulently. 'That doesn't mean someone is not doing it illegally,' he added.

Horse meat is a common sight in France, like at this Paris butchers. But it is rarely eaten in the U.S.

The European crisis started in mid-January, when Ireland's food safety watchdog announced that it had discovered traces of horse DNA in burger products sold by major British and Irish supermarkets.

The mislabeled products came from Irish processor Silvercrest Foods, which withdrew 10 million burgers from store shelves.

Irish officials first blamed an imported powdered beef-protein additive used to pad out cheap burgers, then frozen blocks of slaughterhouse leftovers imported from Poland - an indication of the complexity of the food-supply chain that was about to be revealed to an alarmed European public.

Traces of horse meat have turned up across Europe in frozen supermarket meals such as burgers and lasagna, as well as in in fresh beef pasta sauce, on restaurant menus, in school lunches and in hospital meals.

On Friday, several British supermarket chains - including Morrisons and Tesco - said their tests had been negative so far. But Britain's Food Standards Agency said 29 of 2,501 products tested contained at least 1 percent horse DNA. All were burgers, lasagna and meat sauces sold by supermarkets and catering firms.

The scandal has also spread beyond 
supermarket foods. Whitbread PLC, Britain's largest hotel and restaurant
company, said Friday that horse DNA had been found in lasagna and 
burgers on menus at its outlets including Premier Inn hotels and Brewers
Fayre and Beefeater Grill restaurants. Whitbread said it was 'shocked 
and disappointed at this failure of the processed meat supply chain.'

Officials also said horse meat was 
present in cottage pies delivered to 47 schools in Lancashire county, 
northern England, and in hospital meals in Northern Ireland.

Tests are continuing, and officials 
say this is far from over. 'The more people have looked for horse meat, 
the more products have been found containing it,' said Duncan Campbell, a
senior British food inspector. 'I don't think we have got to the bottom
of it yet.'

European officials say the scandal is
the result of fraud, and possibly an international criminal conspiracy 
to pass off cheap horse meat as more expensive beef.

The French government says the chain of fraudulent meat sales reaches across 28 firms in 13 countries

Scandal: Meat from Spanghero found its way into Findus beef lasagne in Britain

At least some of the horse meat 
originated at abattoirs in Romania, and was sent through a 
Cyprus-registered trader to a warehouse in the Netherlands.

A French meat wholesaler, Spanghero, 
bought the meat from the trader, then resold it to the French frozen 
food processor Comigel.

The resulting food was marketed in 
Britain and other countries under the Sweden-based Findus label as 
lasagna and other products containing ground beef.

French authorities blame Spanghero for the fraud, but it strongly denies wrongdoing.

'The responsibility started upstream,' chief executive Barthelemy Aguerre said Friday. 'We didn't want to cheat anyone.'

The Romanian companies and the Dutch 
trader also deny fraud. They say the meat was clearly labeled as horse 
when they handled it.

Dutch prosecutors said Friday that 
food safety experts raided a meat processing plant as part of a criminal
investigation into horse meat fraud. Prosecutors said the company in 
North Brabant province is suspected of fraud and money laundering.

The company - which was not named, in
line with Dutch privacy laws - is believed to have processed horse meat 
from the Netherlands and Ireland, and mixed it with beef before selling 
the mixture as 'pure' beef.

Separately, British authorities have 
raided five businesses - including an English slaughterhouse and a Welsh
meat processor - on suspicion of passing off horse meat as beef in 
burgers and kebabs. Three men have been arrested.

Horse meat itself is not harmful, and 
is eaten in several European countries, including France, Germany and 
Italy. In English-speaking countries including Britain and Ireland 
eating horses is widely considered taboo.

British officials have said that 
horses slaughtered in Britain after being treated with the equine 
painkiller phenylbutazone, or bute, may have made their way into the 
human food chain in France.

Bute is banned for human use because 
in rare cases it causes severe side effects, but veterinary experts say 
there is little risk from consuming small amounts in horse meat.

Europol, the European Union police 
agency, is coordinating a continent-wide fraud investigation, and at an 
emergency meeting on Friday the EU approved a plan to conduct random DNA
tests to check for horse meat, and also to check for the presence of 
bute.

The crisis has raised questions about
food controls in the 27-nation European Union - and highlighted how 
little consumers know about the complex trading operations that get food
from producers to wholesalers to processers to stores and onto dinner 
tables.

Critics say the food supply chain is too complicated and lightly policed to be truly secure.

But the European Union's health 
commissioner, Tonio Borg, said French authorities' identification and 
suspension of Spanghero demonstrated 'that traceability of food in the 
EU works.'

'Consumers must be assured that 
everything will be done at the EU level to restore, as soon as possible,
their confidence in the products on our markets,' Borg said.
