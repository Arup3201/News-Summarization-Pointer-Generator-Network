A bright purple, alien like jellyfish has washed up on a Queensland beach and scientists believe it could be an undiscovered species.

The glowing purple jellyfish was found by lifeguards on Coolum Beach on the Sunshine Coast on Wednesday morning.

The extraordinary colour of the marine creature has baffled marine experts, who are now trying to determine what species it is.

'It's straight out of science fiction,' marine biologist Dr Lisa Gershwin said. 'It's an electric, vibrant, wow purple.'

She said the tentacles - or oral arms - were about a metre long and were covered in microscopic mouths.

Dr Gershwin, who works at the CSIRO marine and atmospheric research centre, said it was probably a new species because of the vivid colour.

'The colour just screams “Don't mess with me”,' Dr Gershwin said.

'It's not just a little purple – this sucker is seriously purple.'

Dr Gershwin believes the jellyfish could be a thysanostoma, but said the species was normally brown or beige.

'It begs the question, if it's such a vibrant, different colour, what other features does it have?' she said.

'When we get it under the microscope I think we'll start noticing all kinds of things.'

It's rare to find thysanostoma in Australian waters and even rarer to spot one off Queensland's southeast coast as they prefer the warmer tropical waters.
