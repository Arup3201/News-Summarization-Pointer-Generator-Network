They have been hailed as the key to health, but now there may be some new kids on the block in the superfoods market.

Where grains such as quinoa and spelt have proved popular, nutritionists are now looking at some other ancient alternatives.

One of the most promising is fonio, which could soon be making its way to supermarket shelves.

A crop from West Africa could be the newest superfood on the market. Fonio (shown) is drought-resistant, high in amino acids and very nutritious. This has led some to suggests it could follow in the footsteps of other successful superfoods like quinoa

Superfoods may do more harm than good, a nutrition expert has warned.

Foods such as goji berries, quinoa and kale can cause a host of problems from thyroid malfunction to arthritis flare-ups, says Petronella Ravenshear .

Writing in April's Vogue she said: 'My only comment about these foods is that they should be avoided'.

She goes on to explain that kale - a favourite among celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow - and increasingly used in 'green smoothies' can 'interfere with thyroid function' when eaten raw.

Eating too many grains such as quinoa, regardless of how healthy they are - can cause an overload of potentially gut-irritating compounds.

According to National Geographic, the edible seeds of some of these crops could be the 'next quinoa'.

Fonio for example, Africa’s oldest cereal, is rich in amino acids and is said to be the most nutritious of all Earth’s grains.

Its low sugar content also makes it ideal for people with diabetes.

It has gone fairly unnoticed until now, though, but that could be set to change as superfoodies seek ways to get more of a nutritious fix.

Fonio also has somewhat of a spiritual aspect to it as well, as the Dogon people of Mali think the entire universe was made by the explosion of a single grain of fonio.

Superfoods are popular for their high nutritional value and their minimal exposure to human tampering, making them popular organic foods.

Fonio is itself also rich in protein and drought-resistant, making it an ideal crop for developing nations in West Africa struggling to cope with climate change.

Some are now trying to bring it to Western markets as well to benefit consumers, following in the footsteps of previous superfoods like spelt and quinoa.

One of the problems with the rise in popularity of other crops, however, is that they have priced locals out of the market.

One example is the açaí berry, which in 2009, at the height of its hype had reached 60 times its original price, meaning some who regularly ate it were not able to purchase it.

The rise of superfoods like fonio, meanwhile, while also threatening a price hike, could take the pressure off some of the other crops and make farms more sustainable.

And teff, too, is another superfood that is growing in popularity.

This Ethiopian cereal is high in fibre and iron, and also provides protein and calcium, but is smaller and cooks faster than other crops like quinoa.

Time will tell if either can grow in popularity enough to become the 'next quinoa'.
