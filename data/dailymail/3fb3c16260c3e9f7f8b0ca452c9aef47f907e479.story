A woman was left traumatised after she was forced to tear her three-month-old puppy from the jaws of a fox after he was snatched from their garden patio.

Stacey Willis, 21, and her mother Kerry saw their puppy Max - a King Charles Spaniel - being snatched by the vile animal before carrying him away in his jaws.

The horrified pair followed the harrowing cries of the puppy for 45 minutes before they eventually found him being savaged by the fox in a power station near to their home in Sandwell, West Midlands.

Saved: Three-month-old King Charles Cavalier Max is on the mend after his owner was forced to tear him from the jaws of a fox

Mauled: King Charles Spaniel Max was grabbed at the neck by a fox while out in his owner's garden

Ordeal: As well as several bites to the neck, Max's lower back was also mauled, as seen above

Kerry, 41, said: 'One minute Max was mooching about inside the house and the next this fox had him in his mouth and was disappearing over the fence.

'Stacey, me and my other daughter Cody, eight, were all crying and hysterical with panic, we thought we’d lost him forever.

'We rushed straight after him but the fox was too quick.

'We were desperately searching for him and we could hear Max howling and crying in pain, so we knew he was still alive.

'It was the longest 45 minutes of my life.

'My daughter and I followed the fox into our neighbour’s garden and then across into a disused power station.

Guardian angel: The veterinarian who received little Max praised his owners, saying they saved his life

Playing again: Thanks to his owners quick thinking and veterinary care, Max is back on track

Attack: Max's owners rushed him to the vets following the attack, the level of which can be seen above

'All the time we could hear him screaming, it was awful.

'We had to scale a fence and bank as we followed his squeals.

'I found a metal pole and my daughter managed to separate some bushes, where the fox was hiding with Max.

'I was terrified the fox would attack me or Stacey, I held the pole ready in case he came at us from the bushes.

'We scared the fox enough for him to drop him and my daughter just grabbed Max.

'When we found him we were worried he was dead, he was so little and we were all covered in blood.

'We knew he was in a bad way and we went straight to our vets.

'It terrifies me, because if it was brave enough to go for a puppy, next time it could be a child.'

Max was rushed to White Cross Veterinary Surgery where he was placed on a drip and treated for deep wounds.He has since made a full recovery.

Director of White Cross Vets, Bonnie Leibowitch, said: 'Having worked as a vet for ten years, I have never heard of an attack like this before.

'Foxes can obviously be very dangerous, but to carry out an attack in broad daylight is very uncommon.

'Luckily Max’s owner saw the attack and her speedy response definitely saved his life.'
