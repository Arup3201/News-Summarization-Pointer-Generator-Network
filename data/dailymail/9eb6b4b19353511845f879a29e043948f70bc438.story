There were many fine displays for Mexico against Brazil but nobody outperformed Rafael Marquez.

The 35-year-old, who is Mexico's most-decorated footballer, now plays for Club Leon in his native country.

This was a record fourth time he has captained his country at the World Cup, but it is his most surprising campaign, as he had 15-month spell out of the side before he was recalled for the play-off win over New Zealand.

He made his debut for his country in 1997, but was not selected in the squad that travelled to the 1998 World Cup in France.

Since then, he has gone on to appear 120 more times for his country, scoring 15 goals in the process.

At club level, he started off in Mexico at Atlas, before movng on to Monaco then Barcelona - where, in a seven-year spell, he won four La Liga titles and the Champions League twice.
