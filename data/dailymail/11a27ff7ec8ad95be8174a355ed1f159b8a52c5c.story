A bulletproof backpack for kids has become a bestseller in the US where parents are fearful of a repeat of the Sandy Hook school massacre.

The backpack was created by a Colombian businessman who likes to demonstrate the effectiveness of his bulletproof clothing by shooting staff at point blank range in front of the cameras.

Miguel Caballero, dubbed the ‘Armani’ of bulletproof clothes, designed the children’s backpacks in response to demand from parents after the massacre.

Six teachers and 20 children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, when Adam Lanza, 20, stormed into the building and opened fire.

Mr Caballero already made a range of bullet proof clothing but decided after the attack to start a range of children’s backpacks.

They have proved a hit, he told CBS, with parents desperate to protect their children from the spectre of another school bloodbath.

The backpacks launched under the MC Kids brand, and the US distribution rights were secured by Elite Sterling Security.

Timothy Hogan of Elite Sterling Security was delighted with the take-up since the backpacks went on sale in March.

They cost $250 (£162) each but the company has still managed to sell more than 300 of them in three months.

Bulletproof backpacks produced for boys and girls following the massascre at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year. Despite a price tag of $245 (£160) They have proved popular with parents who want their children to have added protection.

'It provides a lot of protection,' Timothy Hogan of Elite Sterling Security told CBS. ‘It can sustain multiple shots with pretty high caliber weapons.'

‘We look at it as an additional safety measure, no different than wearing seat belts in your car. It's just one more level of protection that can help take care of our kids.’

The backpacks have been made for younger children but there have also been requests for a range suitable for high school pupils.

Mr Caballero and his US  have begun work on creating a larger backpack and hope to have them ready for the market later this year.
