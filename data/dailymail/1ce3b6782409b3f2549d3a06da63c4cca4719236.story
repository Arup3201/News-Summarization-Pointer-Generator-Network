'Spurious science': Gary Bolton, 47, seen outside court today, sold his fake bomb detectors to clients for use by soldiers and police and customs officers

A businessman who sold 'useless' bomb detectors to international clients for thousands of pounds has been jailed for seven years.

Gary Bolton, 47, of Chatham in Kent, sold the fake devices to for up to £10,000 each, boasting that they could detect explosives, narcotics, ivory, tobacco and even money.

But a judge at the Old Bailey today described the equipment as 'useless' and 'dross'.

Tests revealed the devices - which Bolton assembled at his home for less than £5 each - were no better at detection than random chance.

The court heard the businessman was aware of the 'spurious science' behind his product, but continued to market and sell the devices at home and abroad through his firm Global Technical for 'enormous' profits.

He denied two counts of fraud but was convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey last month.

Sentencing the father-of-three today, judge Richard Hone QC said Bolton had maintained the 'little plastic box' was a piece of working equipment, and that he continued to 'peddle' it to scores of international clients - including for use by armed forces - despite evidence proving it was 'useless'.

He added: 'You were determined to 
bolster the illusion that the devices worked and you knew there was a 
spurious science to produce that end.

'They had a random detection rate. They were useless.

'They were useless': Bolton denied two counts of fraud but was jailed for seven years today after being found guilty by a jury last month

Jailed: Bolton, seen left in a mug shot issued by City of London police today and right outside court at an earlier hearing, made 'enormous' profits 'peddling' the phoney bomb detectors to clients around the world

'Soldiers, police officers, customs officers and many others put their trust in a device which worked no better than random chance.

'The jury found you knew this but you carried on. Your profits were enormous.'

The court was told Bolton’s company, Global Technical in Ashford, had a turnover of almost £3 million, with up to 5,000 devices made.

Bulk orders meant the GT200 was sold for between £2,500 and £10,000, although they retailed at up to £15,000 if bought individually, the court was told.

Around 1,200 devices were sold to Mexico, while orders were also shipped to parts of Asia and the Middle East.

The devices are still being used in Thailand, the court heard.

Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, previously said the devices were relatively cheap to make.

He told the trial: 'In fact, the device, you may think, was nothing more than a box with a handle and antennae attached to it and pieces of plastic inside it.

'Bolton knew these devices did not work but he made and supplied them so that they could be sold.'

The prosecutor said Bolton admitted in interview to having no background in science, research, training or security, the court heard.

Members of the jury were told Bolton claimed the devices worked with a range of 766 yards (700m) at ground level and as far as 2.5 miles (4km) in the air - although a Home Office defence expert said it had 'no credibility as an explosive detector'.

Bolton was arrested in June 2010 following an investigation by City of London Police’s overseas corruption unit.

Detective Inspector Roger Cook said: 'Gary Bolton made a fortune selling devices that were supposed to be able to detect explosives and other harmful substances but in reality were nothing more than plastic handles with aerials as antennae.

'In doing so he was putting people’s lives and livelihoods at serious risk, but his sole consideration was how much money he could make.

'Bringing Bolton to justice is the result of a long, complex and far reaching international investigation and his seven-year prison sentence should act as a warning to others who seek to act corruptly overseas with the belief that they will go undetected.'

Bolton’s sentence came after fellow conman James McCormick was jailed for 10 years earlier this year for three counts of fraud from selling fake bomb detectors.

McCormick, 57, of Langport in Somerset, was said to have made £50 million from his scam.

Representing Bolton, Jonathan Higgs QC told the court that his client’s offending - between 2007 and 2012 - was not on the same level as McCormick’s.

He said: 'There is no suggestion that these devices were to be sold to and deployed as frontline devices to counter terrorist threat. 

Trial: Bolton assembled the 'little plastic boxes' at his home at a cost of £5, before 'peddling' them to clients around the globe

'Dross': The boxes' detection rate was no better than random chance, the Old Bailey heard

'The countries to which tenders were made were using these devices for a range of different detections.'

He added: 'This is a device which was sold honestly to start with.'

But the judge said he did not accept that suggestion, also questioning the validity of a psychiatric report which said Bolton was believed to have 'a depressive illness'.

Bolton, wearing a grey polo shirt, black trousers and canvas-style shoes, closed his eyes as his sentence was read out.

The judge said: 'You have damaged the reputation of British trade abroad.

'You gave spurious credibility to this product.

'You’re a fraudulent person. You have no remorse.'

A confiscation hearing is due to be held next year.
