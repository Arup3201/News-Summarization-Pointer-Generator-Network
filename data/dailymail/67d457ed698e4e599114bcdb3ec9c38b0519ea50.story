Jill Kelley, the Florida socialite who hit the headlines over the scandal that forced the resignation of CIA director David Petraeus in 2012, has bought a home for three children tragically orphaned last month in Pakistan.

The Tampa mother-of-three said she was moved by the tragic story of 18-month-old Ponam, Sonan Rani, 4, and Salman, 6. The youngest two children witnessed their Christian parents being burned alive for blasphemy on November 4.

Shehzad Masih and Shama Bibi - who was four months at the time - were viciously beaten by a mob and then thrown in a brick kiln, witnesses said.

The Florida socialite has revealed that she has arranged for a house to be built for the orphaned 18-month-old Ponam, Sonan Rani, 4, and Salman, 6, who are being cared for by their grandfather

The killing was sparked by the mob's belief that Shama Bibi had desecrated a copy of the Koran. By the time the attack was over, only charred bones and the couple's discarded shoes remained.

More than 50 people have been arrested in connection with the incident which took place in Chak 59 - a village situated in Kasur district, 60 kilometers from Pakistan's second largest city Lahore.  

Kelley, who has worked with the U.S. Central Command on interfaith and alliances, contacted a Catholic priest in the  region who helped her find a house for the children who are currently being cared for by their grandfather, reports the New York Post.

'I personally paid for the house and we have just gone into contract. Nothing will bring their parents back, but if I can help these children and do something to provide for their future at Christmas then it is worth it.'

Kelley received global media attention for triggering the investigation that revealed that intelligence chief Petraeus was having an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell.

'My life has changed drastically because of everything that has happened, but I believe there is a silver lining, and if I need to use my notoriety to bring awareness to humanitarian issues in the world, I will do that,' she said.

Kelley, whose uncle is a Syrian Catholic leader, also joined a private audience with Pope Francis last week along with Catholic bishops from Middle Eastern nations to discuss the genocide of Christians in the region.

She is attempting to rehabilitate her reputation which took a battering following the Petraeus scandal.

In September she was informed that she can pursue a lawsuit which claims the government invaded her privacy during the scandal.

Kelley claims the FBI and Defense Department violated her privacy when officials leaked damaging information about her to the media.

In 2012, Kelley, who has friends in military circles, complained to the bureau when an anonymous individual sent her harassing emails.

Her concerns triggered an investigation that led agents to Broadwell, who was romantically involved with the married Petraeus at the time.

However, after a search of her emails, the bureau publicly announced that she had 'inappropriate' email conversations with General John Allen - even though she is married.

She claims that agents deliberately leaked her name to the public and then released the correspondences to insinuate an affair between them and smear her name.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Kelley could sue government officials in a move that could reveal more information about the scandal that unfolded two years ago.

Court filings by her lawyers claim the government falsely told one news outlet the emails between Allen and Kelley were the equivalent of phone sex. 

Mrs Kelley was forced into hiding after the allegations were disclosed.

She has only recently spoken out about how she feels it was unjust for her to be forced into a defensive position even though she believes she did nothing wrong.

All of the parties involved in the tumultuous scandal- Petraeus, Broadwell, Allen and Kelley - were all married to other people, but Kelley claims that Petraeus and Broadwell were the only two that had a romantic relationship.

Mrs Kelley, with her cancer surgeon husband Scott at her side, fought back against the federal government for releasing her name in connection to the Broadwell investigation and further insinuating an inappropriate connection to General Allen.

She served as a volunteer civilian liaison to MacDill Air Force Base, where Petreaus and his wife had been stationed when he served as head of the military's Central Command.

Petreaus struck up a friendship with Kelley, but Broadwell feared he was having an affair with her, as well.

The married intelligence chief resigned from his position as Director of the CIA in November 2012, citing his extramarital affair.
