A daughter bravely took the stand  to face her neighbor who shot dead her mother before spending 10 hours raping her and sexually assaulting her two friends.

Jamey Shields faced Duncan Willis, 27, who killed her mother Katherine Hawley, 58, after marching to her Michigan home in a fit of rage thinking she had reported him to child welfare officers.

Shields faced her attacker, saying he was not worthy to be called by name and that his children do not deserve to have him as a father, reports MLive.com.

When Willis responded to her, saying: 'You know nothing about me,' he was ordered to be silent by the judge.

Sarah Baker, whose seven-month-old daughter and two seven-year-old boys were in the house while she was being attacked, said: 'My whole world has been rocked.'

'He didn't ruin me because I will never let him win.' 

Willis was sentenced to a term of life plus 202 years on Wednesday for the murder and brutal attacks at a home in Mecosta County, Michigan in 2013.

Willis shot Kathleen Hawley, 58, a mother-of-two and grandmother, in the head as soon as she arrived to help her daughter 

He was found guilty earlier of first-degree murder, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent and felony firearm. 

Willis had recently gained custody of six-year-old twins and was caring for three other children.

But the attack began when he decided a report to child welfare workers had come from someone in Shields' house - police said it did not.

Armed with a long gun he went over to Shields' home - she was on the phone to her boyfriend at the time, but ended the call suddenly.

Her concerned boyfriend, who was out of the state, then alerted her mother who rushed over to the home.

But Willis shot Hawley, a mother-of-two and grandmother, in the head as soon as she arrived. 

Her body was on the floor throughout the ten hour ordeal which ensued and he did not attempt to hide it from the children in the home. 

He then raped and sexual assaulted Shields and two other women - ages 20-30 -  in the house.

Police say Willis kept the women and three children hostage all night before finally surrendering after negotiations - the children were not hurt.

Willis denies committing any of the crimes, an attempt to deflect responsibility that rings hollow, according to Mecosta County Prosecutor Peter Jaklevic.

Willis in a mugshot - he has previous convictions

When news of the attack was made public in 2013 his relatives said they were at a loss to understand what happened.

'He is not that monster,' his sister Melissa Earl said at the time, reported Mlive.

She admitted he struggled with anger issues and alcoholism in the past and did have a record of domestic violence.

He had previous convictions for domestic violence and assault.

Earl said she had spoken with Willis a day before the attack to make plans for their mother to drive from Texas to Michigan to spend Thanksgiving with Willis and his children.

But she said he struggled with anger issues and stress for many years and had visited Community Mental Health weeks before the attack but claimed his appointments were cancelled.

Willis had most recently worked two jobs, one as a Pizza Hut manager. 

Hawley's niece told FOX 17 her aunt was married to a retired police officer until he passed away from cancer.

'She took care of her husband until his last breath. 

'Aunt Kat was a caretaker, always looking out for her family.

'She adored her dogs. She had many throughout her home,' she said.
