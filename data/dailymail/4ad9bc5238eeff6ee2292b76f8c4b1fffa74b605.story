Drunken Patrick Revins has been jailed for 27 months after being caught twice in possession of three large knives.

Revins stumbled into a branch of Barclays in Hanley, Staffordshire, at midday on January 21 and pulled a bread knife on terrified staff.

A bank clerk found that 49-year-old Revins’s cashpoint card could not be used because the limit had already been reached that day.

Revins who has a variety of tattoos on his face including his initials and the name Annette began muttering about a woman that he knew ‘who had done it’ and said he was going to ‘have her’.

The bank staff asked him to leave and that was when he lifted his top and pulled a large bread knife from the front of his trousers.

Revins then put the knife back into his trousers and left the bank. Revins was arrested 20 minutes later. Police seized a large kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade.

Two days later, while on bail, Revins was stopped again, and found to be carrying a bayonet and a large carving knife. Police arrested him.

Sentencing Revins at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court Judge Paul Glenn told him: ‘You were unable to walk in a straight line in the bank, no doubt due to drink and or drugs.

‘Courts have repeatedly emphasised the seriousness of carrying knives.

‘Those who carry knives frequently end up using them.

‘You habitually carry knives when drunk or under the influence of drugs. You plainly represent a danger to others.’

The court heard he has a history of violence, including a wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm case in 2006.

William Rickarby, defending, said in mitigation that no one was threatened and Revins made no attempt to use the knife in the bank.
