Farmer Deb Morrison described them as a 'triple treat'.

'It's unusual to have triplets for a start but it's unusual to have them in different colours,' Ms Morrison told Nine News.

She said the three may have a different fate to other cows on Morrison Dairy, which is also a beef farm.

'They hold a very special place in my heart so I think I'll keep them on the farm,' she said.

Ms Morrison says the farm had black and white triplets 20 years but they didn't survive.

She says Calamity Jane, Cassius and Elly May are all very healthy.
