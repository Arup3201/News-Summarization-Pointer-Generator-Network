'Like porn': Tamara Rojo is pictured performing with Carlos Acosta in July 2009 in Havana, Cuba

Ballet is like pornography because it is often choreographed by men, the English National Ballet’s new artistic director has said.

Tamara Rojo wants more female choreographers for her company, after saying that because of the many male directors in dance, ‘Like in porn, it shapes the way you look at things’.

The 39-year-old dancer and director said that relationships are often shown from a male perspective and that she wants to see certain issues ‘approached by women on stage’.

Miss Rojo said that men often approach dance choreography in a ‘more physical’ way by starting with the steps, rather than women who often begin with the ‘emotional landscape’.

She told Time Out magazine: ‘Female sensitivity is different. And there are issues that I want to see on stage approached by women.

'Very often we see relationships approached from a male perspective.

‘Like in porn, it shapes the way you look at things. It tends to be a more physical approach. Men start with the steps. I find women start with the emotional landscape.

‘They say, “This is the situation, let’s find a language for it”. With men, it tends to be, “this is the language”, and then you try to work out the situation through the steps.’

She added that the lack of female choreographers is partially down to women taking breaks to have children and that they are ‘not aggressive in self-promotion’.

No major new works by female choreographers have been commissioned by the Royal Ballet in 14 years - and the English National Ballet last took one on 11 years ago, reported the Daily Telegraph.

But works by young female choreographers have been featured by both companies on tours and for performances not on the main stages.

For example, a fusion of ballet and contemporary dance was co-choreographed for a tour this year by Jenna Lee of the English National Ballet, with Flawless from Britain’s Got Talent.
