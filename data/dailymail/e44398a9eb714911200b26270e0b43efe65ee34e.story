West Bromich Albion will consider selling Saido Berahino for offers in the region of £20m this summer.

The England U21 international was due to hold contract talks but has upset high-ranking figures at the club with an interview in which he said he wanted to ‘move on to bigger things’.

Albion manager Tony Pulis will speak to Berahino about his responsibilities and could fine the striker. Pulis wants Berahino to remain focused on the job of keeping Albion in the Premier League first and will discuss his future in the summer. 

Saido Berahino has found the net 14 times for West Bromwich Albion so far this season

Berahino said this week that he wants to keep West Brom up before 'moving on to bigger things'

Berahino has scored 14 goals for West Brom this season and earned an England call-up

Premier League clubs have an interest in the 21-year-old but not at the price Albion want.

The club will shelve pending contract talks and will consider offers of £15m plus at the end of the season.

There were no bids from Tottenham Hotspur or Liverpool in the January transfer window, both of whom have been linked with the player, and other big clubs have yet to come forward as they wait to see how he develops.

Albion had hoped that the striker, who has scored 14 goals in all competitions this season, would concentrate on their battle for Premier League survival after receiving a 12-month ban for drink-driving. 

West Brom are willing to sell the striker for around £20m in the summer 

Tony Pulis will be looking for Berahino to keep his West Brom side in the Barclays Premier League

Berahino said in the interview: ‘I’m taking care of my short-term goals right now and if I keep scoring goals and doing well for West Brom, I know the future will be bright for me and I’ll go a long way.

‘I need to stay focused on what I’m doing right now, which is scoring the goals and keeping West Brom in the Premier League. If I can keep them up and score as many goals as I can, I’m pretty sure the fans wouldn’t mind me pushing on and moving on to bigger things.’

Albion go to Burnley on Sunday in the Barclays Premier League, three points above the relegation zone.
