A dog whose only puppy disappeared now walks the streets of a Chinese city carrying a board appealing for help to find her 'darling' puppy.   

Aidi's owner, Yang Fan, said her puppy went missing while he was walking the two dogs in Jilin in north-eastern China's Jilin province.

The sign reads: 'I will pay the one who helps me find my darling dog.'

Aidi stands with a sign reading 'I will pay for the one who helps me find my darling dog'

Mr Yang, 65, was given Aidi by his son after he moved away for work four years ago, leaving him to live alone. Mr Yang's wife had died just over a year before, and his son worried his father would be lonely.

He said: 'I was not so bothered at the start about having a dog but must admit we are now very close, she has become one of my family and is a great companion.' 

Aidi had two puppies, but only one survived. The missing puppy, said to have been in good health when it disappeared, is now two-and-a-half-months old. 

Mr Yang said: 'I was taking both mother and puppy for a walk, and the young dog was very excitable but always kept close to its mother. But then suddenly we both noticed it was gone, and although we looked everywhere we could no longer find the puppy.'

Mr Yang said Aidi has always been 'very intelligent and she realised quickly what the sign was for'

Mr Yang said Aidi never gave up wanting to look for her offspring.  

'Aidi was really upset and the next day when she continued to want to go out searching for the puppy, I decided to make her a sign to carry. 

'She has always been very intelligent and she realised quickly what the sign was for, and we have had lots of people reporting sightings but so far none of them have worked out. But we are getting new leads every day, and I hope we might still be able to find her puppy.'

Mr Yang added: 'It's been like losing a member of the family, I hope somebody will be able to help.'
