An old crowd favorite at Minnesota Timberwolves' basketball games known famously as 'Jiggly Boy' made a special comeback to celebrate Kevin Garnett's return to the team.

And he brought his moves. 

When the Target Center stadium's jumbotron first caught John Sweeney in the audience, he only gave the camera a couple of quick waves.

It was a far cry from the beloved Jiggly boy of the 2003-04 season, when Sweeney was known to strip off his jersey and rip off his tank top and get down, with 'WOLVES' scribbled on his stomach and 'KG' for Garnett written on his arm.

Crowd favorite John Sweeney, 49, brought back Jiggly boy for Kevin Garnett's welcome home game with the Minnesota Timberwolves 

Sweeney first created Jiggly boy for the team's 2003-04 season (pictured), but hadn't been seen for 10 years 

Sweeney got a text days from the team's game operations a couple of days before Garnett's return that said: 'KG is coming back. What about Jiggly?'

The crowd went wild the minute Sweeney appeared on screen during the February 25 game against the Washington Wizards, with many instantly recognizing him despite the years that had passed.

And the camera soon panned back to the 49-year-old dad, the announcer asking 'Wait a second, can we go back there?'

One of Sweeney's sons tries to grab his dad's arm and pull him up to dance, and the camera held on him - an invitation and a tempt.

But Sweeney shook his head no and encouraged his sons to dance instead.

The camera panned away again but the announcer wasn't ready to give up. 'Let's give it one more try,' he told the audience, who wouldn't get enough. 

As Usher's Yeah cames on, Sweeney finally relented. His sons pulled him out to the stadium's stairwell, where he still seemed hesitant.

But then all of a sudden, Sweeney broke out into his famous moves, his sons flanking him from behind like backup dancers.

Jiggly Boy was back. 

After a couple of dips, Sweeney took off his shirt to reveal KG written on his stomach, and 'welcome home' written on his chest.

Then he gave the audience what they really want to see: body rolls. 

And Garnett didn't miss the show, giving Sweeney a salute. 

When Sweeney responded with an enthusiastic thumbs up, the basketball player tapped his heart to show his appreciation and gratitude.

'I think if you saw a fat guy with everything off, dancing with your name on his chest, I think you would pay attention to that, or at least for five seconds,' Garnett said 

'I think if you saw a fat guy with everything off, dancing with your name on his chest, I think you would pay attention to that, or at least for five seconds,' Garnett later told the Star Tribune. 

It was the Timberwolves' game operations that asked Sweeney for a comeback. 

Sweeney told the Star Tribune he got a text days before the welcome home game that said: 'KG is coming back. What about Jiggly?' 

But although Sweeney, an improv comedian, may not be stage shy, after 10 years he said he now also has to consider his two sons, aged nine and 11.

'We had a good philosophical discussion on the car ride home,' he said. 'About when it's appropriate to take your shirt off.'
