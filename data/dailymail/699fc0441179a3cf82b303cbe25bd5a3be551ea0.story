Joey Barton was injured after being punched outside a Liverpool nightclub in the early hours of the morning.

The controversial QPR midfielder was involved in a fight with two men outside Garlands nightclub in Liverpool city centre.

Barton decided not to press charges.

A picture of the incident, apparently showing a shirtless Barton being held back by police and a woman, appeared on Twitter.

A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said:
'Merseyside Police were called to Eberle Street in Liverpool city 
centre at 5.30am this morning following reports of an altercation.

'On arrival officers found a 29-year-old man who had sustained injuries to his face. The man left the scene voluntarily.

'Two 21-year-old men from the L13 area
were arrested at the scene for a public order offence. They are 
currently in police custody.'

QPR's press officer Ian Taylor confirmed on Twitter that Barton will not press charges and claimed the midfielder was on his way home with his girlfriend when he was taunted by two men singing offensive chants.

'Joey Barton was involved in an incident in Liverpool City centre in the early hours of Monday morning,' Taylor posted.

'Barton was on his way home from a night out with his girlfriend when two men sang offensive chants and then proceeded to hit the midfielder.

'Police were immediately on the scene and arrested one man. Barton decided not to press charges and left with his girlfriend soon after.

It was alleged that the footballer had to be 'physically removed' from Garlands by security staff before he was punched outside.

Property entrepreneur Martin Makepeace, a friend of Garlands staff, wrote on Twitter: 'Just spoke to the lads at Garlands Liverpool who told me that Joseph Barton was physically removed from the club before the fracas outside.'

Nobody from the club was available to confirm the events leading up to the attack
