Leeds United caused a rift with their own supporters on Monday night after teasing them about potential business to be done during the closing stages of the transfer window on their official Twitter account.

The Elland Road club, who are managerless following the departure of David Hockaday, told their fans to stay awake during the last hour of deadline day as there was business to be done.

What they failed to prompt fans is that it would be players departing the club rather than arriving, leading to dismay among the Leeds faithful.

Tease: The official Leeds Twitter account indicated there was business to be done before the window shut

Outbound: The Elland Road side confirm Matt Smith has departed the club for fellow Championsip side Fulham

Another departure: Leeds confirm another striker on his way out of the club - Dominic Poleon

Conclusion: Leeds United confirm they have completed all their business in this transfer window

Departing: Matt Smith and Dominic Poleon (right) left Leeds United on deadline day

Messages from Leeds fans included: 'Are you for real', 'you kept me up for that' & 'you sold two promising players, congratulations'.

After earlier completing deadline days moves for Brian Montenegro on a season-long loan and former loanee Souleymane Doukara on a permanent deal, fans wouldn't have been too dissatisfied with the business done.

But after the messages coming from the club's official Twitter account with just an hour of the window remaining about 'work to be done' they would have anticipated further signings.

Both Matt Smith and Dominic Poleon departed the club in the closing stages of the window to Fulham and Oldham Athletic respectively. 

Sassuolo's Leonardo Pavoletti was believed to be on the club's radar but with no manager and limited time left in the market to act it would have perhaps been wise for the club not to post a message indicating potential signings were on their way, as a result irking their own fans.
