When housewife Jamie Jones found herself a bit lonely, instead of taking up a conventional hobby, or meeting new friends in her area, she started penning letters to American prisoners- with her own husband’s encouragement.

She had begun the letter writing in September 2012 as something to do to fill her time but then she fell in love with one of her pen pals, who was locked up for murder.

She felt compelled to confess her feelings to her husband Scott but he then banned the 27-year-old, from Southampton, from writing to the criminal ever again.

Pen pals: Jamie Jones started penning letters to American prisoners with her husband's encouragement but then she fell in love with one who had been convicted for murder

However, he said he was happy for her to keep her 14 other prisoner pen pals, convicted for crimes including drugs, bank robbery and assault.

‘Scott told me to stop writing to Jack,’ Jamie explains. ‘I think he was worried I would fly over to be with him. But he still lets me write to the others as he thinks they appreciate hearing from me.’

Unable to work due to a prolapsed disc, full-time mother-of-one Jamie decided she needed a hobby in September 2012.

With Scott working long hours as a driver and canvasser, and their son, Darren, five, at school, Jamie began writing to US criminals after reading about it in a magazine.

Opening up: Jamie was penning letters to prisoners convicted for crimes including drugs, bank robbery and assault. Right: An unnamed prisoner she was writing to

She found a website featuring their profiles. Each one included the inmate’s name, where they came from, the crime they’d committed, their sentence, release date, and a photo. 

‘I asked Scott what he thought and he said it would give me something to do,’ Jamie says. ‘He also thought it would help the prisoners feel like they had support.’

Looking through, one profile stood out.

‘Jack was 26 like me and he’d written in his profile that he wanted to get his family out of poverty when he was released,’ Jamie explains. ‘I liked that about him. We also had the same star sign, Leo.

‘At first I was nervous about what to write. I told him I was from Canada and had moved to England to marry my husband who I’d met online. I said we had a son, Darren, and I enjoyed making new friends.’

Passing her days: Jamie found a website featuring their profiles or prisoners - each one included the inmate's name, where they came from, the crime they'd committed, their sentence, release date, and a photo

Betrayal: Scott found out about her falling in love with a prisoner and was angry. 'He said he'd trusted me and I'd betrayed him. I told him that if he'd paid me more attention I wouldn't have looked elsewhere,' she said

When Jack replied, he told Jamie he’d been in prison for nine years, since he was 16.

To begin with they wrote once a day. After two months they were emailing each other back and forth throughout the day.

Jamie says, ‘I started to see Jack as a best friend, someone I could talk to about anything, even my marriage, so I confided in him that me and Scott were arguing all the time.

‘I felt Scott didn’t understand how lonely I was. Jack Bear, as I’d nicknamed him, knew what it was like to feel isolated.’

Then, last September, when Jack and Jamie had been writing for a year, he sent a letter confessing he had feelings for her.

‘I was stunned,’ Jamie says. ‘I told Scott and thought I’d have to stop speaking to Jack as he’d said he loved me.

‘But he said as long as nothing came of it, I could carry on writing to him.

‘I was relieved he didn’t want me to stop, but I was angry too.

‘Why wasn’t my husband jealous that another man loved me?’

Staying in touch: After Scott found out she fell in love with one prisoner, he banned her from writing to them but didn't mind her writing to 14 other inmates, including one who'd killed his wife in a motorcycle accident. Pictured are two unknown criminals she wrote to 

With Scott’s encouragement, Jamie even started to write to some other prisoners.

But as time went on, Jamie realised it was Jack’s letters she looked forward to most.

‘My feelings for Jack had deepened. I wondered if it was possible to be in love with two people at the same time,’ Jamie admits. ‘Confused, I confided in Scott’s stepdad.

‘But Scott found out and was angry. He said he’d trusted me and I’d betrayed him. I told him that if he’d paid me more attention I wouldn’t have looked elsewhere.

‘He wanted me to stop speaking to Jack. He was worried that as I’d moved to England to be with him, I could move again to be with Jack.

‘So I contacted Jack to tell him Scott had found out I had feelings for him, and I could no longer write to him.’

Jamie didn’t hear from Jack again.

Sticking together: Jamie said she is trying to salvage her marriage and that what happened with Jack has made her and Scott stronger as a couple. 'We've realised what we have together. I hope one day Scott can forgive me,' she said

But Scott didn’t mind her writing to 14 other inmates, including one who’d killed his wife in a motorcycle accident.

His name was Shaun and he’d been convicted of drunk driving and homicide.

‘When I read his letter, I felt so sad,’ Jamie says. ‘He’d loved his wife so much.’

Few husbands would be as understanding as Scott.

‘He still supported my writing,’ Jamie says. ‘He said he thought my letters would keep the prisoners sane and feel like they had a connection to the outside world. I like hearing that I’ve brightened up someone’s day with my letter.

‘I want to show that it’s not a bad thing to write to these people, they’re not bad people.’

Now Jamie receives around 20 emails a day and says nothing will stop her writing to the men.

‘They’re not just my pen pals anymore, they’re my friends,’ Jamie says. ‘But I’m trying to salvage my marriage. What happened with Jack has made me and Scott stronger as a couple. We’ve realised what we have together. I'm so happy Scott's forgiven me.'
