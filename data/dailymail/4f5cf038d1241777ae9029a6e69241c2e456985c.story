The bombshell of a wife's illicit affair with one of Washington's most powerful men would likely put a dampener on any married couple's romantic getaway.

Dr Scott Broadwell found himself in this position on Friday evening after the romantic plans he had organized to celebrate his wife Paula's 40th birthday were abruptly shattered by the revelation that she had been having a relationship with decorated general David Petraeus.

The couple were enjoying a two-day break at the Middleton Inn in Little Washington, Virginia when news of the scandal broke, leading to Petraeus stepping down as CIA director.

Sources told the Washingtonian.com that the couple had enjoyed 'strenuous' bike rides, champagne and cozy dinners since arriving at the luxury inn on Thursday evening.

The Broadwells took the Ascot Room at the Manor House which is available for $295 - $475 a night. It boasts a working fireplace, four-poster bed and private marble bath.

According to sources, Dr Broadwell, a radiologist, had arranged for Champagne and a bouquet of roses for his wife's milestone birthday.

There is plenty to do in the idyllic 
Blue Ridge Mountain region. Along with breathtaking scenery, perfect for 
hiking and bike rides, the town of Little Washington - just 70 miles 
from D.C. - boasts fine dining. wineries and artisan boutiques.

The couple reportedly joined other guests at the Inn for breakfast - but by the time they returned from a romantic dinner on Friday evening, they were described to the magazine as 'not being in very good moods'.

They left abruptly on Saturday morning and were allegedly on their way to D.C. A party had also been planned for Mrs Broadwell's birthday on Saturday night - but it was cancelled.

The Middleton Inn could not confirm to MailOnline today whether Dr and Mrs Broadwell had stayed at the premises out of respect for guests' privacy.

The Broadwells have two young sons and live in suburban Charlotte, North Carolina. The family's upmarket home has been empty since the weekend with two silver cars parked in the brick garage.

Paula Broadwell moved to Charlotte, more than three years 
ago with her doctor husband and their two young sons.

On their driveway, power-washed writing reads in a flourishing font: ‘Dad loves Mom.’

Neighbor Ed Williams told the Charlotte Observer that
he emailed Paula Broadwell on Friday following the news, asking if there was 
anything he could do to help. He told the paper that Broadwell 
responded, saying that her family was alright, and to look after their 
house.

Earlier in the week, Williams, a retired editor, saw Broadwell with her two children when she was voting in last week's U.S. presidential election.

He told Reuters that Broadwell appeared chatty and cheerful. Neighbors were working on putting together a belated party to celebrate the release of her book.

Indiscretions aside, the 40-year-old has a 
series of accomplishments under her belt. A graduate of West Point 
Academy, she went on to travel to Afghanistan and conduct research at 
Harvard.

Broadwell was in the Army Reserve after 
being recalled three times to active duty since 9/11 to 
work on counter-terrorism issues.

Petraeus's relationship with Paula Broadwell, his biographer who is a fellow Westpoint military graduate, was revealed on Friday after an FBI investigation which suspected corruption between the pair.

But Broadwell's father, Paul Kranz, 
said that he is standing by his daughter '100 per cent' - and expects 
more details into the affair will emerge, suggesting it was part of some
cover up.

'This is about 
something else entirely, and the truth will come out,' Kranz said 
outside his home in Bismarck, North Dakota on Sunday.

Supporters
of Petraeus were quick to cement the timescale of his affair - saying 
that it began last November and ran its course by July this year.

Colonel
Steve Boylan, a friend and former spokesman, said today that the 
relationship with Broadwell began in November 2011 - two months after 
Petraeus became CIA director.

It suggests that the illicit 
relationship began only after Petraeus had left the military - and so 
exempting him from prosecution as adultery is considered a crime in the 
armed forces.

The affair came to light after the 
FBI investigated a series of threatening emails sent to 37-year-old Jill
Kelley, who works for the State Department in May.

The
warnings, that told Mrs Kelley to 'stay away' from Petraeus, left her 
feeling threatened and she contacted the FBI. However the trail led to 
sexually explicit emails from an account created under a fake name by 
Petraeus.

She had met 
Petraeus in 2006 when she was a student at Harvard's John F. Kennedy 
School of Government, and the two casually exchanged emails for two 
years.

In 2008, Broadwell 
bonded with Petraeus while interviewing the four-star general during 
runs on the Potomac River as she pursued her Ph D in public policy.

Broadwell,
who spent three years doing researching for her biography entitled All 
In: The Education of General David Petraeus, had extensive access to the
head of military operations while he served in Afghanistan.

Petraeus quit his post as CIA director while offering an apology when the scandalous revelation came to light. He issued a statement acknowledging the affair after President Obama accepted his resignation, which was announced by the CIA soon after.

Dr Broadwell is not the only spouse for whom the affair would have come as a bombshell - the disgraced CIA director has been married to his wife Holly for 38 years. 

She is so angry at his affair that 
'furious would be an understatement', a former spokesman for Petraeus 
said. Col Steven Boylan said Holly Petraeus is 'not exactly pleased 
right now'.

The heartbreak comes just one month after the couple appeared the picture of unity at the wedding of their daughter, Anne, in an elegant ceremony in Berryville, Virginia - around 40 miles from Little Washington.

Members of Dr Broadwell's family revealed that they only learned of the alleged affair as they watched reports of Petraeus's dramatic resignation last week.

'They didn’t find out about the affair until they saw it on the news Friday night,' the grandmother of Broadwell's husband, Scott, added.
