Police had alleged Mr and Mrs Giannasca had argued the night before her disappearance over allegations his father Antonio had sexually abused a girl

In 2012 Mr Giannasca was found not guilty of killing his wife Carmel Giannasca, who went missing from their home on or about January 12 2002.

Mr Giannasca had been charged with murdering Mrs Giannasca, who was 33 at the time of her disappearance, and whose body has never been found.

He reported to police that she was missing three weeks after she was last seen.

Police had alleged Mr and Mrs Giannasca had argued the night before her disappearance over allegations his father Antonio had sexually abused a girl.

However, the alleged abuse victim - now an adult - said she could not remember if she had mentioned the alleged abuse to the couple before Mrs Giannasca's disappearance while being cross-examined during the murder trial.

Mr Giannasca's barrister, David Dalton, SC, said the alleged abuse occurred after Mrs Giannasca's disappearance.

He said his client's wife could have been kidnapped or ended up anonymously in a psychiatric ward.

A NSW Supreme Court jury found Mr Giannasca not guilty for both a charge of murder and an alternate charge of manslaughter.

Mrs Giannasca is still listed on the national missing persons register.

Antonio Giannasca was never charged with any offence.
