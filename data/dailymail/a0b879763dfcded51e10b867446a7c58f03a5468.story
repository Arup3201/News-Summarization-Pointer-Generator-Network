'It would’ve been too emotional,' a source close to the opening’s organizers told the New York Daily News. The source added the organized respected Bush's decision not attend on Thursday.

However, the same day, Bush was in Bentonville, Arkansas, receiving the Patriot Award, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society's highest recognition.

President Barack Obama speaks durign the dedication ceremony of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum on Thursday in New York. Former President Clinton attended, but former President George W. Bush was absent, stirring some controversy

Bush was an iconic figure in the days following the attacks in New York, Washington, D.C. and rural Penssylvania that claimed nearly 3,000 lives. A few days after two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, Bush stood on top of rubble on the site, and using a bullhorn, reassured Americans.

That bullhorn is in the museum as part of a loan from the the Bush Presidential Library.

A woman named Marie from Queens, New York called the Rush Limbaugh show on Thursday, saying she lost her firefighter son on 9/11 and didn't understand why Bush wouldn't be included in the ceremony.

'He should have been the first person to speak, or at least his name mentioned,' Marie said. 'I'm very upset. I lost a son there.'
