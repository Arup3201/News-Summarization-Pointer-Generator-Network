This is the moment an unarmed robber calmly strolled into a bank and threatened staff before escaping with more than £2,000.

The man, wearing tracksuit trousers and a hooded jumper bearing the Great British flag, can be seen entering the Natwest branch on Gosforth High Street in Newcastle at 9am on August 8.

Sporting dark sunglasses, the raider is filmed placing a brick in the front door to prevent it from closing before lifting his hood up to approach staff at the counter.

Brazen:  Robber, wearing tracksuit trousers, sunglasses and a distinctive hooded jumper, strolls into the Natwest branch in Newcastle on Friday morning

Unidentified: Police are appealing for witnesses to the robbery which took place on Gosforth High Street in Newcastle on August 8

He is seen speaking to two tellers - behind a protective window - for several seconds before being briefly interrupted by a witness behind him.

Unperturbed, the hooded man turns back to face staff and continues his demands before being handed a wad of cash amounting to £2,480.

After leaving the branch he stays at walking pace until turning a corner into Gosforth shopping centre - at which point he breaks into a run, escaping from the south entrance. 

No one was injured during the incident and police say they do not believe the man was armed.

It has been suggested that the raider scared staff by claiming to have a concealed weapon.

Detective Sergeant Don Gibson, of Northumbria Police, said: 'We want to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and who saw anything.

Unarmed: Police said they do not believe the man had a weapon when he threatened the tellers at the bank

'The footage shows a man entering the NatWest Bank at 9.05am and approaching the counter. 

'He may have been hanging around the area before 9am, and at that time of the day that area of Gosforth is fairly busy.

'We want to hear from those who saw anything suspicious, anyone who was in the area at the time of the robbery or who recognises the man from the footage.'

Police cordoned off the bank and the multi-storey car park while officers on the ground and in a helicopter searched for the culprit.

The branch, along with Bridgfords Estate Agents next door, remained shut off for several hours while forensic teams worked to gather evidence.

The robbery shocked shoppers on the street and forced some stores to lock their doors.

Nicola Krzysiak, manager at Thomas Cook, opposite the bank, said: 'We're operating a closed door policy because you don't know who's out there. The safety of our staff is paramount.'

Anyone who recognises the man should contact police on 101 - extension number - 69191, quoting reference number 320080814.
