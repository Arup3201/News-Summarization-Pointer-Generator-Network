Paul Walker's grief-stricken girlfriend appeared in public Tuesday for the first time since the fiery car wreck that cost the actor his life. 

Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, 23, made an emotional visit to Walker's Santa Barbara home yesterday - just three days after the 40-year-old star of the Fast & Furious franchise was killed along with his friend Roger Rodas in a horrific Porsche crash.

The young woman appeared visibly shaken as she spent three hours at the house with her late boyfriend’s family.

Some of the photos captured outside Mr Walker's Santa Barbara home depicted his girlfriend of seven years sitting cross-legged in the bed of a pickup truck and talking to an older man.

It has emerged that when Jasmine, who was present at the fateful charity event in Santa Clarita Saturday, learned of the crash, the woman collapsed.

Eyewitness Jim Torp told Hollywood Life in an interview that he was the one who broke to terrible news to the college student.

'Paul’s girlfriend was standing next to me when I got the phone call,' Torp told the magazine. 'When I told her what happened she fell, she collapsed.'

According to Torp, it may have been 
Pilchard-Gosnell who took upon herself the awful task of telling Paul 
Walker's daughter, Meadow, about her father's death.

‘I
 believe she is the one who told Meadow about what happened, and when 
she found out she was hysterical and crying,’ Torp, of Reach Out 
Worldwide charity, said.

On
 Wednesday, the deceased actor’s father, Paul Walker Sr, was also 
photographed for the first time since the tragedy emerging from the 
popular Del Taco restaurant with a to-go cup of coffee in his hand.

Relatives have revealed to MailOnline that the 23-year-old student has been spending a lot of time time with her mother, Julie, as she struggles to come to terms with the passing of the man with whom she was planning to build a future.

She had reportedly been dating Walker since 2006 when she was just 16 and he was 33 - but the 17-year age gap has been no barrier to them both finding love.

Jasmine’s uncle Barton Bruner said: 
‘Paul was a really good guy and Jasmine is broken up by this. I went to 
Thanksgiving with him, played golf with him.

‘They had their ups and downs but they were together and looking to spend a bright future together.

‘This is horrible news and unexpected. Her mother is with her and she is comforting her’.

Jasmine,
 a college student who lives in Santa Barbara, California, was 
supposedly beginning to become the step-mother to Walker’s daughter 
Meadow, 15, even though she is only eight years older than her.

Jasmine’s
 presence in Walker’s life may have been one of the reasons why Meadow 
decided to move in with him earlier this year, having spent her entire 
childhood with her mother Rebecca Soteros, who lives in Hawaii.

Walker had spent Thanksgiving with Meadow and friends and was scheduled to return to Atlanta to continue filming the seventh Fast and the Furious film when he died.
