A British team has arrived in Antarctica to begin a search for life in a lake that has lain buried under nearly 10,000ft of ice for up to a half a million years.

Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey are preparing to bore down to the subglacial Lake Ellsworth, deep beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet, to collect samples of water and sediment.

Toiling under the midnight sun, they will endure temperatures well below freezing in a quest to discover whether life can survive in one of the harshest environments on Earth.

The Lake Ellsworth drill site on the West Antarctic ice sheet: Four British scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000ft of ice

Should they find any organisms living in the icy depths, it could offer tantalising clues as to how life might look if it exists elsewhere in the solar system, such as in the ice-covered oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa.

The ambitious search comes after a U.S. team last week announced that they had discovered another lake locked for 3,000 years beneath 65ft of Antarctic glacier was teeming with living organisms.

But the Lake Ellsworth mission will drill far deeper, into a far more extreme environment, which scientists believe has been isolated for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer.

Mike Bentley, a geologist on the team 
at Durham University, told the Guardian: 'Extreme environments tell you 
what constraints there are on life.

'If
we find a particular set of environments where life can't exist, that 
creates some bookends: it tells you about the limits of life.'

For Queen and country: The mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent

One of more than 400 subglacial lakes 
in Antarctica, Ellsworth is equivalent in size to the UK's Lake 
Windermere, measuring 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide, and nearly 500ft
deep.

Completely cut off 
from any light from the Sun, any life lurking beneath its waters must 
endure complete darkness, intense pressure and subzero temperatures.

It
is only geothermal heat from the Earth's core and the intense pressure 
exerted by the weight of the ice above that has kept it liquid.

Four
scientists arrived at the camp above the lake yesterday, where they 
joined a team of engineers who have spent the past month preparing the 
equipment that will be used to penetrate the icy crust.

This week they will finalise the preparations for the three-day drilling hot water drilling operation set to begin December 12.

Technology: The BAS team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch

Under pressure: They will first bore down to 
1,000ft, then stop to create a cavity, then drill a second hole all the way down to the lake. The 
cavity will stop geysers of pressurised water from erupting on the surface

Lake Ellsworth is one of 200 subglacial lakes in the Antarctic: Equivalent in size to the UK's Lake Windermere, it measures 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide, and is nearly 500ft deep

It has spent the best part of three millennia locked under a 20m block of ice and is six times saltier than sea. And at 13°C below zero, Lake Vida in East Antarctica is one of the coldest aquatic environments on the planet.

Yet despite posing some of the most hostile conditions on Earth, the lake is teeming with life.

Scientists drilling into the lake have found abundant and diverse bacteria - potentially giving insight into how life might exist on other planets, the journal Nature reported.

'Lake Vida is a model of what happens when you try to freeze a lake solid, and this is the same fate that any lakes on Mars would have gone through as the planet turned colder from a watery past,' said Peter Doran of the University of Illinois, Chicago.

'Any Martian water bodies that did form would have gone through this Vida stage before freezing solid, entombing the evidence of the past ecosystem.'

Doran and his colleagues have drilled into Lake Vida twice: once in 2005 and again in 2010.

Lake Vida was originally thought to be an ice block lake. However, in 1995, ground penetrating radar surveys revealed a very salty liquid layer underlying a 20m  ice cover.

The BAS team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch.

They will first bore down to 1,000ft, then stop to create a cavity, then drill a second borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way down to the lake.

The cavity is what controls the pressure of the liquid being drawn from Ellsworth, stopping a geyser of prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and spilling out over the surface of the ice.

Once they reach the waters, they will have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense UV light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before the hold refreezes again.

Chris Hill, a British Antarctic Survey engineer who is heading the programme, spoke to the Guardian by phone from his tent on the West Antarctic ice sheet.

'It's bloody cold,' he said.

The team will spent six weeks at the site, where temperatures, according to the BAS, are -25C, with winds of 20 knots. For much of that time they will work around the clock.

'Once we've started drilling we can't stop, or the pipes will freeze and that's that,' Mr Hill said.

'We have to go to a 24-hour shift pattern for a week and a half to two weeks, and no matter what the weather does, we have to keep going.'
