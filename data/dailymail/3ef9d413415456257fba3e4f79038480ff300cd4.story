Motor-mad millionaires are being offered the opportunity to buy a one-of-a-kind Lamborghini built to resemble a fighter jet.

The Lamborghini Pregunta is going under the hammer for £1.4 million.

It is the only one ever to be built and is the swan song of the Italian automobile giant before its takeover by Audi-VW in 1998.

Motor-mad millionaires are being offered the opportunity to buy a one-of-a-kind Lamborghini built to resemble a fighter jet

It is a one-of-a-kind which was built to resemble a fighter jet.

It is being sold for £1.4 million.

It was the last car to be built by Lamborghini before the company was taken over by Audi-VW in 1998.

It uses cameras to capture its surroundings instead of mirrors.

It has 503 horsepower and a top speed of 206mph.

Having been used to headline car exhibitions across the planet since 2006, one plucky petrol head now has the chance to snap up the unique motor.

The Pregunta's inside is based on a fighter jet cockpit - it even has the paint to match - and instead of mirrors it uses cameras to capture its surroundings.

French firm AutoDrome, who specialise in rare car auctions, are selling the extraordinary machine and insiders expect wealthy collectors to take a keen interest in the V12 two-seater concept car.

Michel Levy, from the Paris-based company, said: ‘There has been a lot of interest in the car already.

‘The irreplaceable Lamborghini Pregunta is the last prototype ever built by the Italian company before its takeover by Audi-VW in 1998.

‘It is a fascinating automobile, irradiating power and extreme speed. Like a dream-car come true in a dull landscape, it is the last Lamborghini Italian prototype, the swan's song of a legend.

‘It is a car with great history importance, and with radical, innovative concept and design.’

The Pregunta was built as a basis to create new models and cars - its futuristic design and shape broke engineering boundaries.

By combining advanced technology with animal beauty it boasts a breath-taking 530 horsepower and a top speed of 206mph.

Mr Levy said: ‘The style of the Pregunata is exceptionally rich, innovative, a deliberate breakthrough from the conservative and even conformist design of today.

‘This car was the last and ultimate special coachwork ever built on a Lamborghini base - just before the Marque Lamborghini was merged into the industrial Audi-VW Group.

‘It's therefore very important since it historically stands as the final conclusion of thirty-five golden years of the Sant'Agata Legend.’
