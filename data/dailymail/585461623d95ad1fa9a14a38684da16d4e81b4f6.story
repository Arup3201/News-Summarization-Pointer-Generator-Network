An epic burger weighing more than three stone is the biggest ever made in the UK, according to The Bond Hotel in Blackpool.

The chefs made the colossal burger, which weighed 45lbs, from 30lbs of beef and a 21-inch-wide bun - adding 2lbs of mayo and 3.5lbs of cheese.

The dish, which included 1lb of tomatoes and 1lb of lettuce, weighs the same as an average four-year-old, and is the size of a satellite dish.

The huge slab of meat was cooked for two hours and eaten by 12 customers at the hotel in South Shore.

Hotel owner Graham Atkinson is now hoping the burger, which beat the previous record by 10lbs, will be classed as the biggest ever made in the UK.

'It was really good fun putting it together,' he said. 'Guests at the hotel though thought it was incredible and they never dreamed it was going to be this big.

'I'm almost certain we've smashed the last record for the biggest burger in the UK.'

Mr Atkinson worked as a butcher for 22 years before moving to his family-run hotel 10 years ago.

What diet? The bap alone weighed over eight pounds and there's three pounds of cheese on this too

Guests at the hotel ate the massive burger in one sitting - but it took 12 of them

He admitted he was itching to create a food challenge for many years and said his burger could the the first of many epic food challenges at the hotel.

'I spent many years making beef burgers myself but I never came across anyone doing anything like this,' he said.

'Who knows, we might try another food challenge that's bigger and better in the near future.'

Graham was helped by head chef Mike Maher who called in help from local bakers and meat suppliers to create the mammoth burger.

'Hopefully we could do some more things like this soon, maybe a giant hot dog next time. It'd be great to smash some records.
