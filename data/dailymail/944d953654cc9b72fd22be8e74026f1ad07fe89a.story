A would-be police officer who completed just 10 days in the training academy before going on long-term leave has collected almost $500,000 in tax-free disability payments.

Donald E. Barnes Jr, then 30, was undertaking a 'light jogging exercise' as part of his police training in Chicago, U.S. in 1997, when he collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where he was diagnosed with heat stroke and placed in intensive care due to kidney and liver failure.

Despite never returning to complete his training or working a single day as a Chicago Police officer, Barnes has picked up cheques totalling almost $500,000 - around Â£321,000 - over the past 15 years.

He can keep collecting his annual disability payment - which now amounts to $46,343 and will increase as the salary for an entry-level officer goes up - until he reaches the compulsory retirement age of 63.

Donald E. Barnes Jr has picked up nearly $500,000 in tax-free payments during 15 years on disability leave from the Chicago Police Department

The now 45-year-old stands to receive at least $1.2 million from Chicago's police pension fund when he retires.

After Barnes had used up his allotted year of sick leave following the collapse, the city's police pension board made the decision to place him on duty disability, citing the ongoing effects of heat stroke.

He is entitled to free health insurance for his wife and their two children - both of whom were born after their father went on disability leave.

Barnes, who uses a brace on his left foot and walks with a 'slight limp', according to pension records, has a second job as a regional manager for Standard Parking, which operates the car parks at Chicago's O'Hare Airport and Midway Airport.

In Chicago, police officers are the only city employees allowed to take on outside jobs while on disability leave.

Barnes underwent surgery and outpatient rehabilitation following his collapse in 1997, but has had 'no other treatment or follow-up' since then, according to a pension fund doctor's report dating from 2010.

The doctor's report, which states that Barnes walks with a 'slight limp', deems him 'capable of performing a sedentary light-duty position' within the police department.

If offered a limited-duty position at a desk Barnes would have to move back to Chicago from his current home in Lockport, Illinois.

He is one of 347 Chicago police officers currently on disability leave.

An investigation by the Chicago Sun-Times revealed that Chicago police officers on disability leave are in line for millions of dollars, mostly as a result of injuries sustained while on duty.

Barnes, who declined to comment on the story, is one of two officers collecting disability payments as a result of injuries suffered while still in the police training academy.

The other, Michael Terrano, underwent surgery on an injured knee 17 years ago, then refused to return to work and was fired.

Despite being sacked from the police force and taking on another job Terrano has still picked up disability payments worth more than $560,000.

Terrano, who was 39 when he joined the police in 1995, has also taken on work outside the force since going on leave.

He tore a ligament in his right knee while completing an obstacle course seven weeks into his training with the Chicago Police Department.

After treatment Terrano completed his training and began work in the 19th District, but his knee swelled while on patrol in June 1996 and he was told it required surgery.

By December doctors declared Terrano, of Naperville, Illinois, fit to return to work with the police, but he refused.

He was sacked in September 1997 for violating the police department's sick-leave policy, but applied for disability benefits anyway.

When the police pension board rejected his claim - stating that Terrano could still work in a limited-duty position - he sued.

A judge ruled in favour of the pension board, but in 2000 the appeals court ordered the pension board to pay Terrano disability benefits. The reason given was that the police department had never offered him a limited-duty job.

Terrano, who could not be reached for comment by the Chicago Sun-Times, is receiving $48,434 a year, tax-free, in disability payments.

He stands to have collected a total of $900,000 by the time he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 63.
