A thief made off with a hot air balloon at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that had been in the owner's family for three decades.

Lucinda Wallace traveled from California to witness her daughter fly the balloon in honor of her late husband and was staying at the Nativo Hotel when the balloon disappeared Saturday morning.

KOB reports that the balloon was stolen from the Nativo Hotel along with Wallace's Chevy Suburban bearing vanity plates that read 'baluner.'

The family awoke on Saturday to find only broken glass where the car had been. 

Wallace's daughter Marilyn and a ballooning team were planning to pilot the balloon in honor of Marilyn's father Rick Wallace, who died about two months ago after battling cancer.

The family had almost decided against going to the festival, but changed their mind in order relive some of the family's happy memories from ballooning. 

'It was a little insult to injury because dad's gone and now the suburban's gone and the trailer's gone and the balloon's gone and we really wanted it to be about moving forward,' said Wallace's daughter Marilyn.  

The family first purchased the balloon in 1981 and says that it has flown over the United States and Europe.

'It's been very difficult, he was my very best friend, we did everything together,' said Wallace. 'He loved the balloon and loved sharing it with other people.' 

The Wallaces salvaged their time at the festival, flying back home to Santa Monica, California, to pick up another balloon before driving back to the Fiesta, with plans to fly it Monday.
