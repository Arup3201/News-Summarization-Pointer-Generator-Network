A distraught family has been forced out of their home in NSW after it was discovered their property is one of 1,000 which was sprayed with the asbestos product Mr Fluffy during the 1960s and the 1970s.

The Ziolkowski's had to abandon their Queanbeyan house last week and are now living a rental flat when it was revealed they had unknowingly been inhaling the asbestos particles through the home's heating system for several years, 7.30 reported.

Lisa Ziolkowski was choked with emotion as she struggled to describe about being told the horrific revelation: ‘There's no words to describe what that feels like.'

The Ziolkowskis have been left with no choice but to rent a small serviced apartment and are unable to sell their asbestos-infested property.

‘We can't afford to knock it down and we still have to pay for it, even though we're not living in it,’ she said. ‘We still have to pay for rent as well as paying for the home we can't live in.’

Their home was one of 1,000 properties around Canberra and parts of NSW which was sprayed by the Mr Fluffy loose-fill asbestos in the 1960s and the 1970s - and now affected owners are calling on the government for action.

A Fluffy Owners and Residents' Action Group has been formed in Canberra with the group’s founder Brianna Heseltine asking the government to ‘draw a line under Mr Fluffy homes in Australia.'

The Mr Fluffy home owners are seeking financial aid from the ACT and federal government with some elderly people requesting their homes to be cleaned, other owners wanting to sell their properties and many hoping to demolish and rebuild.

‘I don't understand why a government 20 years ago didn't do what we are asking the governments to do today,’ Ms Heseltine said.

The Federal Government was warned about the product in the 1960s, but it wasn’t until the late 1980s that a $100 million clean-up was put in place across Canberra homes.

While the government knew it was possible that all of the fluff may not have been removed - it was presumed the homes were safe.

Peter Tighe, from the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency, said Mr Fluffy as the ‘most dangerous product that's been put in place in Australian houses over the last 50 or 60 years.’

It was marketed as 'asbestos fluff', the perfect insulating material that 'retains effectiveness forever'.

ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher has set up a taskforce to find solutions and said while there was a growing case to demolish most homes - there was no easy or one-fit solution.

Canberra was expected to request a lower interest loan from the Federal government while the homes in NSW, which were not part of the original clean-up 20 years ago, are still left in with a deadly dust hanging over them with no certainty of plans for the future.
