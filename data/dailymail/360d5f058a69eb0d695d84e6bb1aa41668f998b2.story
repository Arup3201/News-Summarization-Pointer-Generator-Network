When Louise Powis's pet dog Azar lost so much weight he could barely stand, his worried owner rushed him to the vet.

There an X-ray revealed the greedy Doberman had swallowed not one but three golf balls.

And two of them had moved from his stomach into his small intestine where they were in danger of rupturing his small intestine, which could kill him.

No wonder he was feeling ill! The vet says she was astonished to see three golf balls showing up on Azar's X-ray

Azar was also at risk of developing peritonitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdomen's lining.

PDSA vet Kath Vandamme said: 'Azar was very poorly when he was admitted but there was nothing obvious to determine what was causing his illness.

'We put Azar on a drip and took some X-rays of his abdomen, and when I saw the X-ray I could not believe it: not just one golf ball, but three. I don't know how he managed to do it.

'The wall of the intestine was severely bruised and, due to the position of the obstruction, Azar's surgery was a big risk but it was our only option.

'We had to tell Louise that it was touch and go whether he would even survive the operation.'

Miss Powis, 27, of Nuneaton, Warwickshire, said: 'The whole family prayed for Azar to come through the surgery alive and make a full recovery.

Sorry Mum: Azar's owner Louise Powis says her family prayed he would survive the risky operation

'It was a very worrying time and the kids were really scared as well, as they adore him,' the mother-of-three said.

'Thankfully everything went well and only a few weeks later he was back to his old self.'

She said she had no idea where her pet had found the balls.

'We think it was in a field near us where we let him off his lead during walks but we're not sure,' she said.
