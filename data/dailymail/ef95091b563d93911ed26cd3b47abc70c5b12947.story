His matinee-idol looks and Adonis-like physique have possibly contributed as much to Urs Buhler's success as his tremulous tenor. But getting into this  kind of shape takes hard work  and no little commitment. Indeed, Urs - one quarter of hunky 'popera' group Il Divo - is a self-confessed gym addict.

The singer joined the health club in his home town of Willisau in Switzerland as a teenager and likes to work out every day, often twice.

True to form, when we meet he  has just come from a gruelling session of running, cycling, rowing and weights. But today is different.

It is his first time in a gym in three months following an operation to repair a torn muscle in his right shoulder which left him unable  to exercise.

For many, the agony of such an injury would be bad enough, but for Urs, 42, it threw into stark relief just how all-consuming his quest  for a perfect body had become.

He says: 'Working out is such a huge part of my life, and I'll often schedule my whole day around  gym sessions; what to eat and when to eat it. Having that routine and purpose taken away has been psychologically hard.

'But seeing and feeling my body change, losing my muscle definition and bulk, has been even harder. I enjoy the rush that exercise gives me and I enjoy the results even more, but for the past three months I've not even been able to lift a coffee cup to my mouth.'

Though all the members of Il Divo are image-conscious, Urs is the most driven of the band in terms of fitness - his total gym hours amount to about 15,000 since he signed up for his first session - and he has struggled more than most people might with what is a common injury.

He says: 'It's important, how we look. A good suit can only do so much for you - the rest is up to  you, and right now, due to this injury, I'm not where I want to be.'

Although a tear is normally associated with a shock movement, Urs doesn't recall this happening.

'I snowboard a lot and although I've fallen a few times, I don't remember a sudden jolt of pain,' he says. 'I was moving furniture in January last year and vaguely remember something going “pop”. It wasn't excruciating, just a niggle, but as time went on, the irritating discomfort turned into a searing pain.

'I carried on going to the gym and worked through the pain, but as it turns out, the specific exercises  I was doing were the very ones I should have been avoiding: pull-downs behind the head, bench presses lower than a 90-degree angle, and tricep dips.

'All of these exercises make the shoulder joint very vulnerable, and if you haven't got a problem already, there is a high risk those exercises will give you one.'

In March, Urs was in Las Vegas where his girlfriend Kelly Phelan, a professional gymnast who performs with Cirque du Soleil, is based.

Surrounded by athlete friends who have experienced similar injuries, he was encouraged to see Dr James Dettling, a renowned orthopaedic surgeon. He discovered two separate injuries: the first was a tear between the place that the bicep arm muscle attaches to the labrum, a band of tough tissue that surrounds the entire socket of the shoulder joint holding it in place (also known as a SLAP tear), and another to the rotator cuff, the muscles and tendons that also surround the shoulder, controlling and stabilising movement. Dr Dettling says:  'I see a lot of sports people with these injuries. But anybody of any age can sustain it if they happen to fall badly on their arm or shoulder.'

While SLAP tears generally happen due to wear and tear, rotator cuff injury typically happens due to a sudden trauma. Unlike Urs, most people normally know when and how they've done it. 'It's a pretty dramatic injury,' says Dr Dettling.

Eventually, Urs found it was affecting everything he did. 'It got to the point where any movement of my arm above a right angle to my body was impossible. I couldn't even pick up my daughter,' he says. 'If I tried to swim, next day my arm would feel as if it was falling off.'

So with Dr Dettling at the helm, in August last year Urs underwent a reconstructive operation to repair these two areas of the shoulder.

These procedures used to be carried out - and still are by some surgeons - through a large incision  but now the procedure can be done via tiny keyhole 'stabs', or so-called arthroscopic surgery.

Urs's operation took a little more than an hour under general anaesthetic and was done through two small incisions. Dr Dettling says: 'The tissue that anchors the bicep tendon to the labrum was torn, so we had to tie it back up to where it's supposed to be. We do this by drilling a hole in the bone and inserting an anchor attached suture wire, which will stay in place for ever.'

With his arm in a sling for two weeks, Urs assumed that once it was taken off, he could start getting back to normal. 'Everyone kept telling me it would take three months to recover, but I didn't believe it. I naively thought that once the sling was off I could start doing normal things again.

'But as soon as I took my arm out, it just fell limply beside my body. I wasn't able to do anything with  it and I was pretty freaked out. I couldn't even wash my own hair.'

Dr Dettling put Urs on an intense training programme, three times a week for ten weeks, to increase range of movement, and strengthen the shoulder.

Urs says: 'I became very impatient. I'd gone from being such an active person to sitting in an apartment waiting for my next physio appointment. I couldn't even ride my motorbike because I wasn't allowed to hold the handlebars.'

But gradually, his range of movement improved and he was allowed to do gentle exercises using small weights. 'I'd lie down on my hotel room floor and do simple things such as lifting an umbrella,' he says. 'Since the surgery I've also been doing more core exercises. I've pretty much got full movement back, though it's still painful to lift my arm above my head.'

Adrian Wilson, an orthopaedic surgeon at the North Hampshire Hospital, says these injuries are often seen in rugby players or American footballers. So why would something so minor as moving furniture be to blame in this case? He suggests there could have been an older injury that caused a weakness that led to a minor incident, such as hauling coffee tables around, causing the rupture - which was then exacerbated by exercise.

But he adds: 'There's nothing to suggest that once you've sustained an injury like this and had it reconstructed, you're at a higher risk of it happening again. These kinds of repair are very effective and, as long as you do the right physio afterwards and take it slowly, there's nothing to say you won't be back in the gym before long.'

The socket is encircled by a tough band of tissue called the labrum.  This acts to deepen the socket and stabilise the joint.

It is rather like a golf ball sitting  on a golf tee.

The
 large muscle at the front of the arm is called the bicep, and it has a 
 long tendon which fits into the labrum  at the top of the socket, 
anchoring the two together. 

This is where a  SLAP tear occurs.

During the repair operation, instruments  are used to manipulate  the torn tendon back  into position

During the repair operation, instruments  are used to manipulate  the torn tendon back  into position.

The
 insertion point is prepared with a small  drill to make a fixing  
point. The tendon is then attached to a special anchor made of surgical 
sutures, which is then screwed into the bone  fixing the tendon back in 
place.

Surgery is carried out as a day case procedure with 
either a general anaesthetic or more commonly with a block on the nerves
 that supply the shoulder. This means the patient has no pain at the end
 of the procedure.

The shoulder is immobilised in a  sling for 
six weeks and rehabilitated with supervised physiotherapy. Normal 
sporting activities can be resumed  after four months.
