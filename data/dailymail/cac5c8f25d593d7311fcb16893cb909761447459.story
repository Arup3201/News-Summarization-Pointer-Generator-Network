The sex case against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was on the verge of collapse last night after four prostitutes dropped their accusations against him.

All were main prosecution witnesses in the trial in Lille, northern France, in which the 65-year-old is accused of aggravated pimping.

If he is acquitted, it will be yet another remarkable legal escape for the notorious philanderer who has been accused of a series of sex crimes. The women in the latest case had provided days of sordid testimony in which the man known as DSK was portrayed as a ruthless sexual predator.

I solemnly swear: The aggravated pimping case against former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn may be over after four main witnesses, all prostitutes, have dropped their civil complaints

Many said they had been powerless to stop him subjecting them to painful sex acts performed at orgies around the world. One said she had seen DSK being ‘entertained’ by up to eight prostitutes during a single sex session in a Paris hotel.

But court officials yesterday said the four women had dropped their complaint, along with a women’s rights group that was supporting them. ‘All consider there is not enough evidence to brand Mr Strauss-Kahn a pimp,’ said one court source.

This means that just one other organisation called Nid, which campaigns on behalf of those forced into prostitution, is now officially complaining against DSK and 13 other defendants. ‘It does not mean that the trial is over, but clearly Mr Strauss-Kahn’s defence is now in a very strong position,’ said another source.

DSK, who was once considered a shoo-in to become Socialist President of France, spent three days in the dock last week.

He particularly objected to a claim by one woman who said she cried and gestured that she did not want to perform a certain sex act with him, but that he smiled and went ahead anyway. ‘It’s not my concept of sexuality to do it with a prostitute,’ DSK said, adding that he preferred the ‘party atmosphere’ of partner-swapping and swinging.

DSK said that despite the idea given in court papers of ‘frenetic activity’, the orgies were organised four times a year because he had been very busy ‘saving the world from catastrophe’ at the time of the financial crisis.

DSK is accused of aiding and assisting the prostitution of seven women between 2009 and 2011. He and 13 other defendants deny charges of pimping.

Despite a number of previous high-profile accusations against him, including being arrested on suspicion of the attempted rape of a hotel chamber maid in New York, the Lille case is the first time that DSK has faced trial.

He faces up to ten years in prison and a fine of more than £1million if found guilty at the end of proceedings later this week.
