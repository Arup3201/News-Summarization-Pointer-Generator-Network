When the English obsession with Andrea Pirlo turns to the ‘panenka’ penalty he scored against Joe Hart at Euro 2012, England’s keeper can’t remember a thing.

Perhaps it is better that way. It was in Kiev, with England leading 2-1 in the shoot-out at the Donbass Arena, when Hart raised his arms and stuck his tongue out at the Italian as he took aim from 12 yards. Hart guessed to his right and the great Italian clipped his penalty down the centre of the goal. Soon enough, England were heading home.

‘I’ll never regret how it was, I saw it as the best way for us to win the shoot-out,’ said Hart.

‘I don’t think there was personal vengeance from him and there certainly wasn’t any from me. He did what he thought he needed to do for his country and I did what I thought was best for mine.

'I couldn’t even tell you what I did. But it felt right at the time. It obviously wasn’t.’

Now a two-time Premier League winner with Manchester City, these are good times for Hart, 27, and he has come to appreciate the demands of playing at the highest level.

‘I want to do well for this team and this nation,’ he added. ‘A lot of time and effort has gone into it and the more you’re involved the more you realise that it is more than football. It means an awful lot to a lot of people.

'A lot of money has been invested and a lot of time and care, from me personally, has gone into this. I want to make it all worthwhile.’

At the last World Cup, in South Africa, Hart became increasingly irritated with the Italian coaching staff who appeared to be calling him ‘John’.

Fabio Capello was the main culprit and Hart admitted: ‘I did take offence about that, but I’ve calmed down. Since then I’ve been called “John” by a lot of Italians who know me — I think it’s just how they talk. It was just a mispronunciation.’

A goalkeeper’s life is a fragile one and there have been times this season when City’s keeper has been under fire. But he finished the campaign well, and added: ‘It means a lot to have your club and country behind you.

‘I’ve got to keep working hard because potentially I could go through another bad patch again.’
