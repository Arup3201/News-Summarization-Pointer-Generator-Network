Nadya Suleman, the 38-year-old California woman known as 'Octomom', could face over five years in jail for hiding $30,000 in money she earned from stripping and starring in porn on her taxes.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney announced today that Suleman was being charged with welfare fraud and is set to be arraigned on Friday.

The Octomom, whose real name is Natalie Denise Suleman, became famous in 2009 after becoming the second U.S. woman to give birth to healthy octoplets. She had six children before that, making her the mother of 14 total children.

Prosecutors say that in the first six months of 2013, Suleman applied and received over $16,000 in welfare payments, in addition to $6,667 from the CalWorks financial assistance program and $9,814 from Cal Fresh food aid program.

While receiving these welfare funds, Suleman failed to disclose $30,000 in income she earned through public appearances and residuals from videos.

She was charged on January 6 with one count aid by misrepresentation and two counts perjury by false application for aid.

If convicted, Suleman faces up to five years and eight months in custody.

On Friday, prosecutors are expected to ask for bail to be set at $25,000.

This is just the most recent financial hardship for Suleman, who was threatened with eviction last month.

Suleman had been living rent-free in a friend's home but it was sold and the new owner told her she and her brood had to go.

New owner Lana El-Jor said she had problems refinancing the building because of her.

'That’s one of the things why we have to ask her to leave. The bank refused to support the loan. She is said to have left her houses abused and everything and it worried the bank,' Ms El-Jor told the Mirror.

It's uncertain whether Ms El-Jor followed through on the threats to kick the family out by Christmas. MailOnline's calls to Ms El-Jor were not immediately returned Monday afternoon.

Suleman octuplet birth caused controversy in 2009 when it was revealed she was on federal assistance when she was impregnanted by invitro fertilization by Dr Michael Kamrava.

Dr Kamrava had his medical license revoked after the birth for not exercising 'sound judgement'.

Over the years, Suleman has gotten creative trying to provide for her children.

Working mother: Suleman became famous in 2009 after becoming the second U.S. woman ever to give birth to a healthy set of octuplets. She has since resorted to stripping and starring in porn to provide for her 14 total children

She has starred in porn movies, participated in online dating auctions and performed as a stripper.

But she recently vowed to never do porn again.

In her online diary she said: 'I choose not to give my body sexually to ANYONE. Not even myself. I won’t give what I can control away… I am not for sale.

'I’m to blame. I deserve to be punished. Punish me. Hurt me. Destroy me. As I am now done.

'I focused 100% attention on my family, went back on welfare (I know), and never stripped again. Soon…you will be reading these words. And as soon as you are…we will be off welfare forever.'

Nadya won AVN Award for her solo porn tape and has stripped - all to raise funds for her family - but the diary writings reveals the extent of her pain at doing so.
