Officials have confirmed that the 
mummified remains of a woman found in the garage of a suburban Detroit 
home in March were those of the lady who lived there alone.

Authorities
 this week notified the relatives of Pia Farrenkopf that she had been 
positively identified using DNA testing, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Oakland County Deputy Medical Examiner 
Dr. Bernardino Pacris said the cause and manner of death could not be 
determined because the body was mummified.

Investigators
 said in March that they believed the remains were Farrenkopf, a 
self-employed financial trouble-shooter who would have turned 50 this 
year.

A message posted 
Tuesday on a Facebook page set up by a relative said arrangements were 
being made to lay Farrenkopf's remains to rest.

Young and carefree: Pia Farrenkopf - seen here in a high school yearbook photo - is believed to have died in the garage of her home in Pontiac, Michigan, in 2008, however her body was only found in March 2014

Her body was found in the rear seat of her Jeep, inside the garage of her Pontiac home.

Officials
 said she could have been dead for more than five years and that there 
was no evidence of foul play. They sought help from dentists who may 
have treated Farrenkopf, but couldn't secure the necessary records.

Oakland
 County authorities say Farrenkopf paid her mortgage and other bills 
automatically through a checking account that once had a balance of 
$54,000.

The money ran out last year, and the Pontiac home went into 
foreclosure. A contractor sent by the lender discovered the body.

Farrenkopf,
 who was single, traveled the world and had family in Massachusetts.

Strangely her sister, Paula Logan, said she was not extranged from her incredibly private sister.

She claims she repeatedly tried to get in touch with her, but yet did not go by her house.

'It's not like we were estranged.... My sister had died. I tried to get in touch with her,' Logan said.

'My mother passed, too. We tried to get in touch with her. The phone 
just rang, rang, rang.'

Logan said she last saw in 2007.

Authorities believe she died in 2008.

She said Farrenkopf, one of 
10 siblings from an Irish-Belgian family in the Boston area, typically 
stayed in touch even while working or traveling in Germany, England, 
Switzerland and Egypt. 

'She was energetic, bubbly, well-rounded - you know what I mean?' Logan said.

'She had plenty of money. She had 
stocks, insurance. That house was a minute part of what she owned.'

Logan said she asked police in Pontiac to go to Farrenkopf's home, but couldn't recall the date.

'They said they did a wellness check and didn't see anything wrong,' Logan said.

Pontiac
 has been patrolled by the county sheriff's office since summer 2011. A 
message seeking comment was not immediately returned Tuesday.

Logan doesn't believe her sister would commit suicide.

'I think there was foul play. I think someone might have been in that garage,' she told WXYZ.

Farrenkopf's devastated nephew Eric Logan said the news has shocked the family.

'It kills us to read that maybe nobody 
cared for her,' he said.

'It's completely opposite. All of us are just 
devastated. ... We have been looking for her. We've done everything we 
could do, shy of us kicking the door ourselves.'

Farrenkopf's niece Mickelann LeBlanc Burke - just a few years younger than her aunt - shared her grief in a public Facebook post.

'Pia
 was loved by our entire family and was never forgotten! Please keep in 
mind that every family has their own dynamic, function or dysfunction. 
It is easy to rush to judgement not knowing, our family dynamic,' she 
wrote.

'Our family had been
 trying to contact Pia numerous times over the years and now we know why
 our calls went unanswered ... We were all shocked and deeply saddened 
when we heard about Pia.

'This
 is a terrible tragedy and our hearts are broken. Devastated, knowing 
she was alone in that garage all of these years! I hope in time we can 
get some answers to what actually happened to Pia and lay her to 
peaceful rest.'

One of Farrenkopf's nieces has also set up a 'Mummified in Michigan' Facebook page in a bid to clarify reporting about the woman and to get information about what could have happened to her.

Decay: Police had to done HAZMAT suits to enter the home, the interior of which was covered in a toxic black mold

Back seat: Farrenkopf was found mummified in the backseat of her Jeep (pictured) inside the garage of her Detroit home

Farrenkopf's remains were discovered when a bank contractor was sent to the home to 
investigate a hole in the roof after it went into foreclosure in March 
2013.

Farrenkopf's payments
 for her mortgage, utilities and other bills were automatically 
deducted from her bank account which at one time contained $54,000.

The
 money finally ran out, leading to the grim discovery of the woman's 
mummified body lying on the back seat of a Jeep Liberty registered to 
Farrenkopf inside the garage.

Undersheriff
 Mike McCabe told Detroit Free Press that investigators believe the 
woman has been dead since at least 2008. That’s the year the license 
plate on Farrenkopf's Jeep expired.

The body was clothed in a heavy 
jacket and jeans, leading investigators to believe that it was winter 
when she died. The key was in the ignition, but it was switched to the 
off position.

Investigators
 are treating the death as a homicide at this time and say suicide by 
carbon monoxide seems unlikely. The body shows no signs of trauma, 
McCabe says.

Dr 
Bernadino Pacris, the Oakland County deputy medical examiner, said the 
skin was intact on the corpse, but the internal organs had decomposed.

Climate, weather and humidity play a role in preserving a body in such a way, he said.

Unpaid bills: Mail for Pia Farrenkopf on the snowy driveway to the home she once owned

Neighbors of Farrenkopf's on Savanna St said they never noticed anything amiss.

The woman lived alone and kept to herself, often disappearing for days or weeks on business.

According
 to the Detroit News, Farrenkopf was a contractor with Chrysler's 
financing division before her employment was terminated in September 
2008.

Logan said that the Chrysler job had been the reason for her sister's move from Massachusetts to Detroit.

Neighbor Darryl Tillery, 49, said the woman’s mail never piled up at the house and her lawn was kept neat.

'It was pretty manicured,' he told the Detroit Free Press. 'There was no indication there was a body in there, at all.'

Some believed they no longer saw Farrenkopf because she had moved to Germany, something she had indicated that she intended to do. Many left the area after the economy crashed in 2009 wand they could no longer afford their mortgage payments.

The outside of the home was fairly well maintained, but inside a black mold had taken over, McCabe said.

WXYZ reported that Farrenkopf's stepfather Edward Caroll, said she was estranged from her family.

Caroll married Farrenkopf’s mother three years ago. He said Pia Farrenkopf never answered the wedding invitation.

'I tried to find her through the Internet and everything and I never could find her.  And I wrote a letter a couple times and I think some of them came back. Her mother hadn’t heard from her for years and years.'

Farrenkopf's mother died a year-and-a-half ago.
