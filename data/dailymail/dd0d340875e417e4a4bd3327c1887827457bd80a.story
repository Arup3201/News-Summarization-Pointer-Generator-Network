Murder victim: Chef Henry Stangroom, 21, who was stabbed to death in his flat in south London last year

A jilted lover killed his ex-girlfriend’s brother after days spent in a ‘blur’ of wine, cocaine and laughing gas, a court heard today.

Andrew Morris, 30, is alleged to have killed chef Henry Stangroom, 21, ‘in revenge’ after his partner Michelle broke up with him.

The court was told how Morris repeatedly stabbed his victim in the flat in Battersea, London, they had once shared with Mr Stangroom’s sister before shooting himself with a harpoon gun.

She had moved out of the property six weeks before Mr 
Stangroom was killed and Morris allegedly blamed him for the break up of the 
relationship.

The Old Bailey heard how Morris was making a large salary as a financial risk assessor - but was suffering from depression and had turned to drugs.

Consultant psychiatrist Dr Marcus Hughes
 saw Morris the day after the incident on October 18 last year and said 
Morris was ‘bewildered, sweaty, slightly agitated and slightly 
confused.’

He was suffering from alcohol withdrawal symptoms and said he had been drinking three bottles of wine a night.

Morris also confessed to taking large doses of cocaine and had also been inhaling nitrous oxide, or laughing gas.

‘He said he started to use nitrous oxide more often within the past few months before he was admitted to hospital,’ Dr Hughes said.

‘He didn’t say how often he was using it. He told me in general he was using drugs with Henry and his flatmate and his ex girlfriend Michelle.’

Morris told the doctor than his ex-girlfriend would come to the flat just to take drugs with him and her brother.

During the consultation at St George’s Hospital, Tooting, Morris said he would take £150 of cocaine in one go.

The actuary had been suffering from depression and has cut his wrists twice. ‘He told me he had taken four or five overdoses,’ said Dr Hughes.

Michelle Stangroom, the sister of Henry Stangroom, had split from Andrew Morris six weeks before the attack

Morris had hallucinations and was hearing voices that would order him to change the TV channel, but was not suffering from psychotic symptoms.

But according to Morris he had no memory of killing Mr Stangroom.

‘He said the events leading up to his admission to hospital had all been a blur,’ Dr Hughes said.

‘He had no recollection of the fishing spike that had been found piercing his neck.’

Morris had gone to see a psychotherapist Mark Bailey at his Regent Street clinic three months before he killed Mr Stangroom.

He told Mr Bailey how he had been beaten by his father as a child who had smashed his head against a radiator.

Mr Bailey found he was suffering from depression and booked him in for two further appointments, but Morris didn’t turn up.

Mr Stangroom, who worked at the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus was repeatedly stabbed in the heart, lungs and head at the flat in Battersea.

Morris was found in the bathroom with wounds to both wrists and the harpoon spear sticking out from underneath his chin.

He claimed the last thing he could remember was seeing Michelle Stangroom three days before.

There is no dispute he killed Mr Stangroom, originally from Odiham, Hants, but Morris denies murder.

The trial continues.
