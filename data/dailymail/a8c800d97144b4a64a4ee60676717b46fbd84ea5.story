Mia Tui founder and owner Charlotte Jamme

A small company based in London is being threatened by Europe’s largest travel group over its attempts to trademark its company name.

Entrepreneur Charlotte Jamme, founder and owner of handbag maker Mia Tui, said she feels 'sick to my stomach' after receiving letters from German firm TUI AG's solicitors.

The travel group claims the company names are so similar that there could be confusion for consumers – even though one specialises packaged holidays and the other sells handbags and travel bags.

Mrs Jamme said there is no conflict of interest and the British public is intelligent enough to know when they are buying a handbag or a holiday.

She said the corporation has deep pockets and is trying to bully a small business that has just two full-time staff and trades in a completely different market.

She told MailOnline Travel: ‘I just feel sick to my stomach because I know how big TUI AG is and I know how small I am. They are a major global travel company and we are a bag company.

‘You just go cold, and it’s the last thing you really want in your hands especially when I can’t afford to take legal advice.’

Mrs Jamme founded the company in Vietnam in 2010 and moved her operations to Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in 2011, although the bags are still manufactured in Vietnam. She previously trademarked her company’s logo in 2010.

‘Mia tui’ is a Vietnamese phrase that translates to ‘my bag’ in English.

Solicitors for Hanover-based TUI AG, the parent company of travel brands such as Thomson and First Choice, wrote to Mrs Jamme in August and asked her to voluntarily withdraw her application to trademark the text of her company name.

After she refused, they sent a copy of a notice of opposition that has been filed with the UK Intellectual Office. 

Hanover-based TUI AG is a publicly traded company worth billions of pounds

The notice claims Mia Tui’s trademark is identical or similar to an earlier trademark and is being registered for identical and/or similar goods and services.

Mrs Jamme applied for the trademark under Class 18, which covers products of leather and imitations of leather, including everything from suitcases and rucksacks to horse blankets and walking sticks.

She said TUI AG has trademarked its name in every single classification possible, and she wants the company to prove that it trades in goods of leather or imitation leather.

Handbags or holidays? Entrepreneur Charlotte Jamme says there is no confusion for consumers

Mrs Jamme said: ‘There’s no confusion at all. You’re either going to buy a holiday or buy a bag.’

She plans to oppose TUI AG’s notice and follow through with her attempt to trademark her company's name.

In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, TUI AG said it sells bags and rucksacks under its trademarked name and it is simply trying to protect its brand.

The statement said: ‘TUI is continuously monitoring its registered trademarks on an international scale in order to safeguard TUI’s intellectual property rights. In doing so we merely look at trademark criteria, not at company size or other factors.

‘The only decisive factor is whether there is likelihood of confusion between the trademarks concerned. In the case under consideration, “Mia Tui”, TUI sees this fact as being applicable.’

The company said it has filed an opposition against the registration of the Mia Tui trademark because attempts to reach an ‘amicable solution’ failed.

It said: ‘The decision will be purely on legal grounds. It is our only intention to protect our brand from being diluted towards our customers.’
