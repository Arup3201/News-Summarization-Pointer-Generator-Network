A high-profile UKIP politician is facing a racism storm after being caught on camera saying all immigrants to Britain should be sent back home.

Victoria Ayling, who made headlines when she defected from the Tories in March, made the inflammatory comments in a 20-minute video seen by The Mail on Sunday.

On the subject of immigration she talks about restricting the numbers of foreigners entering the UK, but then adds: ‘I just want to send the lot back, but I can’t say that.’

UKIP star: Victoria Ayling is facing a racism storm after being caught on camera saying all immigrants in Britain should be sent back home

Defected: Ayling left the Tory party and joined UKIP in March and is a key ally of party leader Nigel Farage

She then goes on to joke that her controversial remark could one day come back to haunt her. She said: ‘[It could be used for] some future get back at me. Bribery, blackmail – we need the blackmail music don’t we.’

Last night one MP said he was ‘disgusted’ by the comments that had ‘no place in front line politics’.

Mrs Ayling, 54, became a high-profile recruit to UKIP when she confronted David Cameron during this year’s Tory conference and told him she was leaving the party.

She has been called a ‘trusted ally’ of UKIP leader Nigel Farage, so her comments will come as a blow to the party following a year of controversies. Earlier this year, MEP Godfrey Bloom provoked anger after referring to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’ in a speech about foreign aid. He later resigned from the party after he called some female activists ‘sluts’.

Mr Farage last night said that Mrs  Ayling’s comments were ‘slightly odd’. He added: ‘I have met her two or three times and I have discussed policy at length before accepting her into the party.

‘I had no reason to believe she held views that were extreme or inconsistent with ours. While this comment looks odd and unpleasant there may be a context here that is slightly different to the way it appears.’

Defiant: Video filmed by Mrs Ayling's ex-husband Rob in 2008 and last night she said she stood by her comments

Controversial: The 20-minute video was shot to promote her political career

UKIP want to end ‘mass, uncontrolled immigration’ but does not call for repatriation of legal immigrants.

The video was shot in 2008 – but Mrs Ayling last night said she stood by the comments.

Mrs Ayling’s husband, Rob, from whom she has since divorced, helped shoot the footage to promote her political career. In one take, she said: ‘We must basically repatriate those that shouldn’t be here. That’s not quite policy yet. Maybe I should soften it a bit.’ She then added: ‘OK. Send them back.’

Rob is then heard to mutter: ‘National Front.’

In the very next take, Mrs Ayling – a Lincolnshire County councillor and deputy leader of the local UKIP party – says : ‘Multiculturalism is dead, I’m allowed to say that, but maybe Britishness is waving the National Front flag a bit.

‘We must control immigration. We cannot sustain the numbers coming in; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous. Control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in Australia and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak English so they can integrate.’

She adds: ‘I just want to send the lot back but I can’t say that.’

Last night, Mrs Ayling insisted her comments were taken ‘out of context’ and she was only referring to illegal immigrants.

'Multiculturalism is dead': Mrs Ayling references the National Front during the video

'Complete opportunism': Mr Ayling said the video was in the public interest as she tries to become an MP or MEP

She said: ‘It is nothing different from what the Home Secretary is advocating now any way. And the blackmail music is from a Monty Python sketch. I don’t think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect.’

‘I stand by what I said: illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism won’t work. It was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context.’

Speaking about the footage, Mr Ayling said: ‘Victoria said during the divorce she would never be entering national politics again. Now, with her being a rising star of UKIP,  I think it is a public interest story in terms of the electorate knowing what kind of a woman she is.’

‘I remember remarking that [her comment] was a little bit National Front and she replied that we should send them back. I wasn’t shocked as she’s like that all the time.’

‘Victoria will do anything to further her political career. She felt she was passed over by the Tories, that’s why she defected. She has a better chance of being an MP or MEP with UKIP. It is complete opportunism, power at all costs.’ Mrs Ayling was within 714 votes of becoming Tory MP for Grimsby at the 2010 Election, and since joining UKIP has enjoyed a high profile.

'Trusted ally': UKIP insiders said Mrs Ayling was 'fast-tracked' for a council seat

One insider said she was a ‘trusted ally’ of Mr Farage: ‘She was fast-tracked for a council seat and then went on the BBC politics show.

‘She was a “Farage filly”. She was on stage at main conference and was even invited down to London for a photoshoot by Nigel.’

The footage was shot when Mrs Ayling 
was seeking selection as a Tory candidate for EU elections and features 
soundbites on several issues.

In between takes she is asked about defence: ‘Do we want the French to order our troops?’.

She
 replies: ‘Sod that. Just think of Waterloo, bastards.’ When immigration
 is discussed Mr Ayling is heard saying: ‘And your favourite subject, 
immigration...’

The couple 
divorced acrimoniously last year and Mrs Ayling now lives with Kevin 
Couling, who calls himself a ‘Lord’ after buying a title. The couple 
gave an interview to German newspaper Der Spiegel in June this year in 
which Mrs Ayling said Mr Cameron should ‘declare a state of emergency 
and close the borders’ to curb immigration.

Last
 night, local MP Stephen Phillips, said: ‘Immigration is a huge issue. 
But anyone who says they “just want to send the lot back” has no place 
at all in frontline politics. 

‘People who have come here to work hard, to live by British values and to contribute to our communities have always been welcomed.  [Many] will be as disgusted as I am by the views which Mrs Ayling apparently holds.’

Iraqi-born Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi called on Miss Ayling to ‘retract her deeply damaging comments’, adding: ‘Hard-working immigrants contribute significantly to the UK.’ And Labour’s Diane Abbot said she was ‘shocked’

A UKIP spokesman last night said the party stood by the councillor and that the media ‘hampered debate on immigration’ by ‘failing to make the distinction between a frank discussion and unpalatable views’.

‘Given that this was before the time Victoria joined UKIP we cannot comment on why this video was made for the Conservatives.

‘However, we can vouch for her as a capable and decent councillor and support her through this time.’

Mr Farage said he did ‘recruit’ Mrs Ayling but was not involved in her selection as a local candidate.

Holding court: Nigel Farage shares a joke with Victoria Ayling (left) and other UKIP members

Victoria Ayling hit the headlines earlier this year after ambushing David Cameron to tell him that she was leaving  the Tories.

Shortly after the Prime Minister had finished his Conservative conference speech on March 16, Mrs Ayling cornered him to say she was defecting to UKIP because the Tories were ‘no longer the party of aspiration’.

She claimed Mr Cameron ‘lost his temper’ and then ‘twisted’ her hand in anger – a claim that has been categorically denied by Downing Street.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage hailed Mrs Ayling’s defection as ‘fantastic’ and described her as a ‘talented and experienced person who will work hard across Lincolnshire, the East Midlands and, indeed, the county’. 

She was then parachuted into Lincolnshire to fight for a county council seat.

Wedding: Mrs Ayling's ex-husband Rob Ayling with his new wife Kristian

Mrs Ayling was left feeling ‘emotionally betrayed’ after her ex husband left her for a former beauty queen.

The UKIP councillor and Rob Ayling split acrimoniously last year after he had an affair with Kristian Darling. She was a finalist in the Miss America competition in 1987, aged 17.  

A decree absolute was issued in August last year.

Criticising Mrs Ayling for asking for too much from the settlement, a judge said at the time: ‘The wife has been unrealistic in this litigation.

'She has no doubt felt emotionally betrayed but she has taken this beyond the bounds of common sense.’ 

Mr Ayling married Miss Darling on Easter Day this year. The couple divide their time between the US and UK.

Mrs Ayling  lives with Lord Kevin Couling, who is believed to have bought his title, the 64th Lord of Little Neasden.
