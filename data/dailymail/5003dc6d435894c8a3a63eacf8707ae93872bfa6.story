Newly crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year Bradley Wiggins is to be offered a knighthood - but there are huge doubts about whether he will accept it.

It has been recommended the Tour de France winner and Olympic gold medallist be placed on the Queen's New Year's Honours list.

Wiggins and three other stars - sailor Ben Ainslie, Paralympic cyclist Sarah Storey and Paralympic track star David Weir - will be asked to become Sir or Dame on January 1, it has emerged.

Icon: Bradley Wiggins was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year on Sunday and is set to be offered a knighthood - but will he take it?

Popular: 'Wiggo' has become a British hero and won Sports Personality in a landslide win backed by 500,000 votes from the public

But 32-year-old Londoner 'Wiggo' has hinted he may shun the honour as he is uncomfortable with 'hierarchy and status'.

This would fly in the face of huge online campaigns and support from the Prime Minister - all desperate for him to become Sir Bradley after his sparkling year.

He won sports personality in a landslide victory backed by almost 500,000 public votes lodged in just 35 minutes on Sunday.

After the victory he was asked if it was the perfect end to his year and he replied: 'Yeah, it is. There’s only the knighthood to come, isn’t there, really?'.

Fun: Bradley and his wife Catherine both enjoyed his victory at the ExCel on Sunday

The day job: Wiggins is now one of Britain's most famous men because of his sporting excellence, winning the Tor de France this year and collecting gold at London 2012 - one of seven Olympic medals in his career

Big win: Britain went wild when Bradley won the Men's Individual Time Trial on day five of the London Olympic Games

But the badboy of British sport, sometimes seen swearing at photographers, stumbling out of nightclubs drunk or having a cheeky cigarette, may turn it down.

In his autobiography My Time he wrote: 'During the Games, there was speculation about whether I might end up with a knighthood in the same way Sir Chris Hoy did after his great year.

'People asked me about it, so I did wonder whether I would accept it if it were to come my way.

'I can never see myself being given a title like Sir Bradley Wiggins. I have never considered myself above anybody else. I have always struggled with hierarchy and status.

Romp: Wiggins won gold medal by a huge margin and showed his superiority as the world's top cyclist

Cool customer: Bradley Wiggins sits on the throne as he celebrates winning gold and is known to be uncomfortable in the spotlight

'I don’t know what it is – maybe just my upbringing, the area I’m from – but I’m quite happy to play second fiddle.

'I understand my physical capabilities sometimes give me status but, when it’s all done and dusted, I struggle with that kind of thing.

'It’s not what happens to kids from Kilburn.'

Seven time Olympic medallist Bradley Wiggins has a CBE from 2009, Ben Ainslie, who has medals from five consecutive Olympics, including four golds in a row also has a CBE.

British sports icon Bradley Wiggins said today that winning BBC Sports Personality Of The Year topped off a perfect 2012.

He won with 500,000 votes - more than the number of people who voted for all the candidates in 2011.

'That's (SPOTY) is an institution and to be voted by the British public was incredible. It topped off the year,' he said.

'It was a great moment and to have Kate Middleton and David Beckham there to give me the award was just amazing.'

David Weir has an OBE and won four golds in ten days this summer while Sarah Storrie has an incredible 22 Paralympic medals in swimming and cycling including four golds at London 2012.

This quartet are viewed as perfect for the top honour the Queen can bestow.

But Danny Boyle, who orchestrated the much-loved Opening Ceremony has also be offered a knighthood, but may also turn it down.

The success of London 2012 has been so huge that many who played a big part will be recognised.

This means that the usual quota system, which only allows one sporting great to be made Sir or Dame, will be torn up this year.

Government rules saying that sportsmen and women can only be handed four CBEs, 20 OBEs, and 38 MBEs will also be steamrollered.

Great moment: Decorated sailor Ben Ainslie won his fourth straight gold at London 2012 and could soon become Sir Ben

Sporting great: Sarah Storey claims gold in the Womens individual C4-5 Road Race, equalling icon Tanni Grey Thompson and Sarah could now become a Dame

This is because during the Olympics there were 29 gold medallists and 35 Paralympic gold medallists and 185 gold, silver and bronzes across both events this summer.

It is rumoured there are so many sporting winners this time they will have their own list within the New Year's Honours' list.

But British cycling and Team Sky coach Dave Brailsford will also become Sir as will LOCOG chief Paul Deighton before he joins the Treasury as a peer.
