Leaving the European Union would not be 'cataclysmic' for Britain, Boris Johnson claimed today as pressure mounted on David Cameron to offer an early referendum on severing ties with Brussels.

The London Mayor said he backed the Prime Minister's plan to negotiate a new deal with the EU, but said he should be prepared to walk away if talks fail.

Tory MPs are to be given a free vote next 
week on a backbench amendment to the Queen's Speech that expresses ‘regret’ 
about the lack of legislation for a referendum on Europe.

Boris Johnson said Britain could survive outside the EU, and David Cameron should 'walk away' if he cannot get a better deal from Brussels

Lib Dem, leader Nick Clegg and former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling have warned 3million jobs depend on Britain remaining in the EU.

But Mr Johnson insisted that withdrawal would not be as damaging to the UK economy as pro-Europeans claim.

'I don't think it would be anything like as cataclysmic as is being sometimes pretended,' he told BBC Radio 4.

'I don't think we would lose millions of jobs. I think the economic benefits and disbenefits are now much more balanced.'

He backed Mr Cameron's renegotiation plan, but said Britain should be willing to walk away.

'My position is that I think the Prime Minister is completely right. What we need to do is to say to our friends and partners "Listen chums, this thing isn't working for either of us. Your eurozone is causing all sorts of misery, plus the on-costs, the non-wage costs, of the way the EU has been running and has legislated and regulated over the last 20-30 years are making the whole area completely uncompetitive".

'We need a renegotiation. We need a look at the way the thing is managed. We should be prepared to pull out. That goes without saying. You can't go into a negotiation like that without being willing to walk away.'

Mr Cameron last night allowed ministers to vote against the Queen’s Speech as he struggled to contain a growing Tory mutiny on the issue of Europe.

Senior Tories ignored the Prime Minister’s pleas to pipe down on the issue in the wake of last week’s elections, when UKIP gave the Tories a bloody nose.

Prime Minister David Cameron today took aim at 'pessimists' about his Europe strategy

Speaking in London yesterday, Mr 
Cameron hit out at the ‘pessimists’ in his own party who warn it will be
 impossible for him to claw back powers from Brussels and negotiate a 
better deal for Britain in Europe.

He said Tory grandees such as former 
chancellor Nigel Lawson and one-time leadership contender Michael 
Portillo were ‘wrong’ to say Britain should leave the EU now.

Former Tory chancellor Norman Lamont 
also suggested Britain would be better off out, saying the economic 
advantages of EU membership were ‘vastly over-stated’.

And a third former chancellor, Labour’s Denis Healey said he now believed the ‘case for leaving is stronger than staying in’.

Tory rebels last night revealed they 
had tabled an amendment to the Queen’s Speech criticising the lack of 
legislation to hold an in/out referendum.

Mr Cameron has told his MPs he is 
unable to bring forward government legislation to enact his pledge to 
hold a referendum in 2017 because of opposition from the LibDems.

But Number 10 last night said he was 
‘relaxed’ about the amendment and suggested Tory MPs and ministers would
 be free to vote for it.

If Commons Speaker John Bercow agrees 
to the vote it will be held next Tuesday. Mr Cameron will be on an 
official visit to the US, but other Cabinet ministers are expected to 
vote in what would be a criticism of their own Queen’s Speech and a 
clear sign of dissatisfaction with the Coalition.

The amendment is purely symbolic but 
its supporters claim it will help build an unstoppable momentum for a 
referendum to be held.

Backers include Eurosceptics John Baron, Peter Bone and John Redwood, and maverick Nadine Dorries.

The amendment does not demand 
legislation on a referendum but ‘respectfully regrets’ that no bill was 
included in Wednesday’s Queen’s Speech, which set out the Government’s 
legislative agenda for the coming year.

Mr Baron said its purpose was to send a clear message that the demand for a bill was ‘not going away’.

It underlines the pressure Mr Cameron is facing to sanction backbench legislation on a referendum.

The Prime Minister’s official 
spokesman said he had ‘always said he is very happy to look at all ways 
of strengthening his commitment to an in/out referendum in the next 
Parliament’.

David Cameron is under pressure to bring forward legislation on his promise to stage an EU referendum

Former defence secretary Michael Portillo said he would vote to quit Brussels while London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured yesterday, argued Britain could survive outside the EU

Yesterday Mr Cameron told a conference
 he was right to try to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU 
before putting the new deal to a referendum after the next election.

He said: ‘I think it is possible to change and reform this organisation and change and reform Britain’s relationship with it.’

Lib Dem sources said it would be ‘extraordinary’ for Tory ministers to vote against the Queen’s Speech.

A source said: ‘The Conservatives seem
 to want to talk about Europe when we should be talking about the 
positive things in the Queen’s Speech like the reforms on pensions and 
social care.’
