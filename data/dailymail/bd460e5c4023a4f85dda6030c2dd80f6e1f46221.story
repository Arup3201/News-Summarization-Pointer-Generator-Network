A man who got so fat he couldn't fit on the London Underground has shed an incredible 16st in just 10 months.

At the beginning of 2014 Andy Butler, 33, weighed 28st and was so worried his enormous frame would get him stuck in a rush hour crush he'd get up to travel to work three hours early - to make sure he could fit on the London underground.

Having conquered bulimia in his twenties, the pharmaceutical worker would starve himself of treats before gorging on them - and watched his weight balloon to dangerous levels.

But after he contemplated ordering a taxi to take him on a 100 metre journey last Christmas, he realised things had gone too far - and on January 1, He bought £150 worth of healthy food, started walking every day and ten months later has lost a whopping 16st.

Newly trim Andy, who now lives in Liverpool, said: 'At my heaviest I'd go to work at 6am instead of 9am so nobody saw me on the tube.

'I was so self-conscious of people staring at me out of breath or sweating - or worse, me not being able to fit in the carriages.

'When I moved to London in 2012, I broke up from a long-term relationship and piled on ten stone in a year.

'I'd hole myself up in my room and gorge on about 10,000 calories a day.

'I was in a vicious cycle where I wouldn't go out because I was ashamed of my size so I'd spend my time eating.'

Andy had had an unhealthy relationship with food since he was 15, when a throwaway insult left him devastated.

He became very aware of his figure and as soon as he ate something, would rush upstairs to vomit.

Despite overcoming bulimia in his twenties, he would starve himself for days at a time, convinced that would maintain a healthy weight.

Eventually, he would cave and eat one small thing before the floodgates opened and he would devour anything he could.

Andy said: 'There was no set pattern to my eating routine.

'Takeaways were the norm for me, because they didn't need cooking so there was no time to talk myself out of them.

'I would swallow the food as quickly as possible in a desperate attempt to finish it all before I was full.

Andy suffered with bulimia in his adolescence but has managed to finally overcome them and is now happy with his body

'To compensate, the next day I would skip meals but then the pattern would start again.

'I would see people eat whatever they wanted, but pretend I was full.

'Then, when I got home, I would eat five times as much if I had eaten earlier on.'

At his heaviest, Andy tipped the scales at  30st, but when he moved home he decided to seek counselling.

Andy says: 'My surgeon was exceptional and played a massive part in changing my life.

One evening he tried to walk around his block, but after getting halfway he considered calling a taxi.

He powered through, and feeling ridiculously proud managed to walk two streets the following day.

On his new regime of healthy eating and daily walks, he lost 5st 10lb by March and explored the possibility of surgery.

He plumped for the stomach reduction surgery, rather than the cheaper gastric band, paying £9,000 to have it done privately

The operation, a sleeve gastrectomy, reduces the size of the stomach by 75 per cent and removes the part that produces the hormone that makes you hungry.

Andy explains: 'I rejected the idea of having it on the NHS as I didn't want people judging me as another fat person getting a free operation.

'I was in the right frame of mind to have the surgery and went for it.

'Because of the exercise I was reasonably toned and wasn't left with a huge excess of skin.

'The surgeon, Mr Li, was exceptional and they played a massive part in changing my life.

'I've lost a further 10st and I'm no longer buying my clothes from plus-size stores.

'I can get both of my legs into just one of old trouser legs!'

Alan Li, Consultant Bariatric Surgeon at the Spire Murrayfield Hospital in Wirral, Cheshire, said: 'Andy is a model patient, one who has been more motivated than most to lose weight.

'It is a very successful procedure and while it is expensive at about £9,000, in the long term it can save you money.

'One of our patients put what she used to spend on food in a glass jar and found that over four years she had saved £20,000.

'Weight loss surgery is not a vanity issue or a cosmetic issue, it is a health issue.

'It reduces your risk of Type Two diabetes by 90 per cent and of high blood pressure by 70 per cent and that has a huge impact on your need for healthcare and on your quality of life.'
