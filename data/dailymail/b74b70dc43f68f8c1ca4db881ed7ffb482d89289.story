At least 24 pilot whales have died on a New Zealand beach after 198 of the sea creatures became stranded on Friday.

Authorities have expressed concern for the remaining whales on Farewell Spit at Golden Bay in the country's south island, as weather conditions proved too warm for the animals,The New Zealand Herald reports.

An attempt to re-float the whales during high tide at about 5pm failed, with many whales becoming re-stranded. 

At least 24 of the 198 whales stranded on a New Zealand beach are reported to have died on Monday 

Up to 500 volunteers are predicted to be needed to keep the animals cool and wet on Saturday 

The Department of Conservation's (DoC) Golden Bay Conservation Services Manager Andrew Lamason asked the public to leave the rescue to trained volunteers, most of whom are from the community group Project Jonah, due to the risks involved in refloating operations. 

However, he estimated up to 500 volunteers would be needed to keep the whales cool and wet until the next high tide on Saturday.

'We'll just keep on trying,' Mr Lamason told the New Zealand Herald.

'Re-floating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job, so it's important we have the right people on the ground tonight trying to get these whales back to safety,' he said on Friday.

However, he added that there was a possibility the whales would need to be euthanized if they remained stranded.

Stranded whales can become dehydrated quickly, suffer sunburns and can die from their own weight crushing their organs. 

The stranded pod, which includes many young whales as well as adults, are beached up to 6km up the shoreline.

'It's like a hapu or a village. It's a whole mixed family group,' Mr Lamason said.

Attempts to refloat the whales during a high tide failed, with volunteers planning try again at the next high tide

Both young and adult whales are part of the pod that are stranded up to 6km up the beach 

The reason that whales become stranded is not completely understood, however it is considered a natural phenomenon. 

'Possibly the leader is sick or disoriented and the herd simply follows the leader or a young whale may strand by accident and the rest of the herd try to come to the rescue,' the DoC's website states.

'They may run into problems when the shoreline is gently sloping; sand and mud absorb the sonar signals they use for navigation, giving a false indication of deeper water.'

Mr Lamason said the shallow hook-like nature of the beach was likely to have influenced the event.

'People should bring buckets, spades and old sheets. A bus will be put on from Triangle Flat at the base of Farewell Spit. People need to be prepared with sunscreen, hats, water, food and warm clothing if they want to assist,' he said of Saturday's operation.
