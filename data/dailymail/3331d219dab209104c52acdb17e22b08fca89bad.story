Gordon Ramsay allegedly told his business partner, Rowen Seibel, he was the 'trademark queen' during a row with a Florida restaurant

Feisty celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has been accused of running Los Angeles restaurant The Fat Cow as a 'dictatorship' - before shutting it down and re-opening under a different name.

Ramsay's business partner, Rowen Seibel, claims in a New York civil suit the ill-tempered cook made business decisions and ruled the burger joint with an iron fist, mimicking his demanding persona on the TV series Hell's Kitchen.

Seibel claims Ramsay 'secretly shut down' The Fat Cow last month before re-opening on his own under the name GR Roast, in a $10.8 million suit rubbished by Ramsay's people as 'ridiculous'.

And Siebel claims Ramsay assured him he would take care of a trademark problem surrounding Las Vacas Gordas, a Spanish restaurant in Florida who had registered The Fat Cow, alleging the chef told him: 'I am the trademark queen'.

'Ramsay attempted to run the business and make decisions on behalf of (his partners) similar to his television personality on Hell's Kitchen â€” as a dictatorship,' Seibel claims in court papers via his lawyer Paul Sweeney.

'Instead, in a dramatic money grab and breach of his fiduciary obligation to Seibel, Fat Cow LLC and FCLA, Gordon Ramsay began taking steps to secretly shut down Fat Cow Restaurant, using the trademark issue as his straw man excuse, and open a new restaurant at the premises without Seibel.'

Seibel's original investment in The Fat Cow totalled around $800,000

When challenged on a trademark row with Florida's Las Vacas Gordas restaurant, Ramsay allegedly told Seibel: 'I am the trademark queen'.

Seibel invested $800,000 in The Fat Cow,
 which opened in 2012, but is not involved in Ramsay's new venture, 
where he will also film his reality TV series, Page Six reports.

'We're surprised that Mr Seibel has the audacity to file this ridiculous suit when he and his team were responsible for the day to day running of The Fat Cow and spectacularly mismanaged it resulting in a string of financial and legal issues,' a spokesman for Ramsay told MailOnline.

'Gordon Ramsay and his team immediately stepped in and tried to resolve these issues, but Seibel refused to engage in any meaningful conversations, rendering the restaurant unsustainable.

'Throughout, Ramsay was very forthcoming with Seibel that any future plan for another restaurant partnership in Los Angeles was impossible due to Seibel's refusal to operate and fund the restaurant properly, sadly including Seibel diverting funds from the business.'

Ramsay was sued by The Fat Cow staff members in a class action last year, where it was alleged they were paid below minimum wage and not given proper breaks.
