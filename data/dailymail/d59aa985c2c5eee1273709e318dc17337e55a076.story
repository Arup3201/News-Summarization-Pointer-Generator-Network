Abigail, 74, said she wanted the treatment to impress her 30-year-old boyfriend

Juel said the 'vagacial' was a new experience but she didn't want to neglect the area anymore

Lisa said of the vagacial: 'The haggard looking vaginas of Britain need some natural remedial help to achieve a youthful vagina by using my DIY vagi-facial recipe once a week. 

'Women are pressurised to have a youthful face at all ages yet we forget about the appearance of our vaginas.'

The professional matchmaker became more conscious of how the years had aged the appearance of her own vulva following the end of her long-term marriage.

As she began dating younger men, she wanted to improve the appearance of her private parts to boost her confidence and improve her sex life.

She explains: 'We tend to forget our nether region, thinking a Brazilian wax is enough. When I was dating my first 'cub' or younger man I looked downstairs to realise it was bit wrinkly and dry compared to when I was younger. 

'Paying more attention to the appearance and feel of our vaginas can do wonders for self-esteem and sexual pleasure.'

Drawing on techniques from the Far East, Lisa said she found the perfect way to improve the appearance and feel of her vagina without plastic surgery.

First, it involves steaming the vagina for 20 minutes. To do this, she recommends 'using a facial steamer - although it can be awkward to squat over - or one that you can hold over that area'.

The women gave mainly positive reviews afterwards to the bemusement of many viewers

Next her natural mix of ingredients must be applied - coconut oil (one teaspoon), Vitamin E cream (one teaspoon), honey (one teaspoon) and egg white (from one egg).

She mixed up the potion - which she said has been developed by 'trial and error' using herself as the 'guinea pig' - on today's This Morning while being interviewed by an intrigued Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley. 

She said of the process to develop the perfect recipe: 'It is a sensitive area so you have to be careful, if something doesn't feel right, stop it.

'I tried using onions as they are meant to be good for the skin but they stung and smelt.' 

Asked if the lotion had been approved by doctors, Lisa replied: 'Doctors haven't said anything, it's just me. I have tried it over period of time and it has worked for me, it genuinely makes a difference.'

The 41-year-old said she's proof it works as she has been told her vagina 'looks like a 25-year-old's'

She said that women who apply the lotion regularly will notice the difference in three to six months.

Three women volunteered to try the vagina facial on today's show. 

One of them was Abigail, 74, who has a boyfriend 44 years her junior at 30-years-old.

She said she was looking for something to perk up her nether region after her GP was unable to help.

She said: 'I went to my doctor and asked for oestrogen cream but she said it could give me a stroke at my age.' 

Speaking after being steamed and while the lotion was on for the recommended 10-15 minute period, Abigail said: 'To be perfectly honest, I'm feeling slightly warm where I'm not usually - so it's certainly doing something.'

Afterwards, she said that she would 'reserve judgement' on whether it has worked till the next time she does the 'horizontal tango' with her 'dance partner.' 

Juel, who also tried it, admitted: 'It's a new experience, it's an area we constantly ignore, we need to love our vaginas.'

She added: 'I feel a bit like I've had sex, a bit damp, am I allowed to say that on TV?!'

The third tester, Nadine, owns a waxing salon and said she thinks it would be a treatment she could offer her clients in the future. 'I think they would like it,' she said. 

The feature prompted a number of reactions from viewers from the bemused to the critical.

Taking to the This Morning comments section, Ann Johns-Johnson wrote: 'This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!!!!!' 

Kelly Marie Speed agreed, she wrote: 'I had to look @ this post twice! Really? This has to be a joke how crazy? What's wrong with a wax and a nice warm shower with ph balanced wash.....seriously I've heard it all?????'

It's not the first time This Morning have broadcast risque features relating to usually private matters - they have previously broadcast footage of a woman having a smear test and a man having a rectal examination for prostate cancer. 

'Paying more attention to the appearance and feel of our vaginas can do wonders for self-esteem and sexual pleasure,' says the 41-year-old dating coach

Lisa, pictured with past-life regression expert Nicolas Aujula, first started focusing on the appearance of her vagina following the end of her as she started dating younger men and felt self-conscious

Begin with a Vagi-Facial for seven days in a row, then repeat once a week. 

INGREDIENTS 

Coconut oil - Can kill bacteria and moistures the skin (one teaspoon)

Vitamin E - Conditions the skin prevents signs of anti ageing (one teaspoon)

Honey - Antibacterial and contains antioxidants to slow down ageing and boosts skin (one teaspoon)

Egg white - Tightens skin and improves texture (one egg white) 

METHOD 

Start with steaming the vagina for 20 minutes. 

Mix all the ingredients and pre-heat in microwave for 20 seconds leave on for 15 minutes then rinse off with rose water. 

Incorporate tightening exercises, clamp down as if you're stopping your urine flow, hold for 10 seconds, then release. Do 2 sets of 10 to 20 a day. 

Lisa promised that as a result of doing the 'vajacial' once a week, women will notice the difference. 

She said she's proof it works: 'I'm 41 and younger men say I have the vagina of a 25-year-old!'

Lisa, who works as a dating coach, says it's the ideal solution for combating vaginal dryness, tightness and elasticity that become more apparent with ageing. It can also help mothers who may be a little stretched following childbirth.

As well as steaming and applying the lotion, she also recommends women do pelvic floor exercises once a day (squeezing the muscles as if trying to stop the flow of urine).

Lisa said: 'As we age and especially during the onset of the menopause, oestrogen production slows and then eventually stops, where the vagina can become dry and thinner. Childbirth and age can often leave us feeling loose that it's important to regularly exercise the pelvic floor muscles.'

According to Lisa, the vajacial will cleanse, tone, and nourish your cervix, uterus, and vaginal tissues and help prevent bladder and yeast infections.

She also said it has increased her self-confidence and self-esteem, enhanced the feelings of sexual gratification and even caused her to drop a dress size as she can wear tighter clothes now she's more toned. 

She said: 'When I tried my first vagi-facial it did feel weird as I'm not used to paying such close attention to that area but you get used to it and now I actually enjoy the experience of pampering my nether regions. 

'I can't believe I neglected that area for so many years whilst married.

'Now my vagina hasn't felt and looked so good in years. 

'The real proof in the pudding is the reaction I've had from guys that I have the vagina of a 25 year old. I've also gone down a dress size which has helped to further tone the skin around my vagina.'

She revealed that she plans to work on a version for men next.
