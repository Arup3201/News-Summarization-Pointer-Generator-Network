These young pandas are more preoccupied with playing than taking their medicine at an animal centre in the Chengdu province of China. 

As their handler tries to administer medication with syringes the playful animals decide to attack with affection in a bid to distract him.

The adorable footage, filmed at Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, shows the young animals clambering all over their handler and grabbing him for hugs as he tries to control them. 

Medicine: The breeder is ready to give the pandas their medicine

In a three-minute video, captured on the iPanda cameras set up at the centre to live-feed the animals gong about their daily routines, the pandas can be seen playing with their human companion.

As the exasperated breeder tries to give one of the panda's medicine while keeping the other at arm's length, the two pandas work in tandem to foil him.

Passive: Initially it looks like the pandas are passive and it will be a straightforward task for the breeder

Restless: One of the cubs jumps on the breeders back and is very reluctant to take the medicine

The cubs use various tactics as they comically reject the medicine such as rolling over, climbing on top of the breeder and covering their mouths with their paws.

The bemused breeder is fiercely determined to give the pandas the medicine, however, his persistence fails to yield any results.

He eventually admits defeat and walks away giving the tired pandas an opportunity to relax.

Tag team: The pandas then combine and grapple with the breeder as they try to keep him away from them

Balance: The breeder then loses his balance in the midst of the physical confrontation and he falls over

Another attempt: The breeder then has another attempt to give one of the pandas medicine 

Failure: The keeper finally admits defeat and gets up after his unsuccessful attempt

Comfort: The keeper comforts one of the pandas before he walks away

Rest: The keeper then walks away and he gives the restless pandas an opportunity to calm down
