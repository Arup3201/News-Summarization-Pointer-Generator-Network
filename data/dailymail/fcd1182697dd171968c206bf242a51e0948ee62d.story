Former coach turned broadcaster Alan Jones defends controversial rugby player Kurtley Beale as 'one of the nicest people you'd ever meet' and says his latest controversies occurred because 'there's only so much you can cop.'

The grand slam winning coach blasted the Australian Rugby Union, claiming controversial star Kurtley Beale is a 'symptom', not the 'disease' for the troubled Wallabies.

The divisive radio personality says Australian Rugby Union is in a state of crisis and in 'absolute disarray'.

Speaking at a Weary Dunlop rugby luncheon in Melbourne, Jones said the late war hero and former Wallaby would be 'disturbed' by the Wallabies' current state.  

Coach Ewen McKenzie is under pressure to keep his position while Beale must face a misconduct hearing after offensive text messages were inadvertently sent to the team's business manager Di Patston, who has since resigned.

Beale also had a verbal argument with Patston en route to their recent Test in Argentina.

Jones said he'd known Beale since his schoolboy days.

'He's one of the nicest people you'd ever meet and he's at all times unfailingly courteous but there comes a limit to what you can cop,' Jones said.

'And when you've had instructions barked at you by a business manager whose role has never been defined and you don't know how that person got the job...

'There's been too much of this and now as a result you want to make Beale the problem; Beale is the symptom he ain't the disease.'

Alan Jones says Kurtley Beale is 'the nicest person' you could meet and his altercations with Di Patston occurred because 'there's a limit to how much you can cop... when you've had instructions barked at you by a business manager whose role has never been defined and you don't know how that person got the job'

Jones said that players were confused and frustrated because of the large number of staff that were involved with the team.

'This is why they get into trouble because there are mixed messages,' Jones said.

Due to celebrate next month the 30-year anniversary of his team's Bledisloe Cup series win over the All Blacks in Auckland, Jones said there needed to be changes.

He said that man for man Australia were as good as New Zealand and capable of being world No.1.

'A fish stinks from the top and there's a smell out there about this wonderful product.

'Unless the board of the ARU and the CEO understand that, we're headed for even worse times.

'No one is going to want to contribute to a game which seems to be so appallingly managed.'

At a press conference on Tuesday, Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie revealed Ms Patston is currently on 'heavy medication' as she struggles to deal with the fallout after her altercations with Kurtley Beale 

This week, Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie spoke out in support of Di Patston, explaining how distressing the ordeal has been for the former business manager.

'I've got a former staff member out there who is heavily medicated, without a job and without job prospects,' he said. 

'She did an outstanding job for me for a long period of time and made a massive contribution,' said McKenzie.

'But now (Di's) suddenly out there on the outer and under massive pressure.'

Wallabies inside centre Christian Leali'ifano has also come out in support of Ms Patston, explaining that her resignation feels like 'losing a mother'.

'I sort of treated her as a mother and she was the same to me and she was like my sounding board if I had any troubles,' Leali'ifano said, according to SMH.

'I can't fault anything she has done for the team.

'She worked countless hours and I was always going over to her and telling her to take a break but she always had things on to make this team better.'

Ms Patston was reportedly recruited to her position with the Wallabies by McKenzie, after working as McKenzie's personal assistant whilst he was the coach of Queensland Reds.

During the press conference, McKenzie explained he had a responsibility to ensure Ms Patston's wellbeing whilst working with the Wallabies, after bringing her.

'When you employ someone you bring them into that environment. But then when that environment then cast them out…' he said.

'I do feel responsible for her welfare so I can't then not take that responsibility.'

'She's out there on her own and it's a difficult place to be.'

McKenzie also indicated that he is currently more concerned about Ms Patston's future than he is about his own, as he faces speculation that he will be outsted as Wallabies' coach.

'If you google (Di's) name it'll be difficult for her to get a job so I think it's been a really difficult time.

'The speculation about my job probably isn't front of mind for me.

'There's a lot of other issues going on at the moment and I like to make sure that I'm attending to things that are important.

'I monitor her welfare.' 

Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked.

'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper.

'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.' 

The scandal has completely overshadowed the Wallabies' preparations for their third and final Bledisloe Cup test against world champions New Zealand in Brisbane on Saturday. 

Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina
