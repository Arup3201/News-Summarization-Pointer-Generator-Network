Behind bars: Florida resident, John David Baker, 29, who is a British citizen, has been sentenced to 25 years for using a fake persona online to solicit child pornography

A Florida actor and talent judge who helped audition young people for the entertainment industry has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for engaging in internet child pornography.

John David Baker, 29, who lives in Celebration, Florida, but is a British citizen, was arrested for creating a fake online persona and persuading children to send him sexual images of themselves.

According to court documents, beginning around November 2008 through August 2010, Baker engaged in online conversations with several minor children over the internet.

During this period, Baker worked as an actor and helped train and audition adults and children who were attempting to pursue careers in the entertainment business, according to  Florida's District Attorney's office.

Working at the same time as a judge for a talent competition in Florida, Baker met minor children who were auditioning to obtain work in the art and film industries.

Federal agents began investigating Baker after concerned parents told authorities he had contacted their child online.

Baker told investigators he chatted with children from a talent competition online and that many of those conversations were sexually oriented.

He admitted he sent or traded numerous sexual photographs of himself during the chats, and that he ‘meant no harm’.

He stated that through his work in the talent industry he received photos of individuals, some through his request and some not solicited by him. According to Baker, he had solicited photos from at least 10 children in the talent competition.

In one instance, he had pretended to be a 15-year-old girl online and used the fake identity to persuade at least two children to send pictures and videos of themselves engaged in sexually explicit conduct.

Investigators found chat logs on Baker's computer which showed he watched one girl perform sex acts via a live web camera.

When questioned by detectives in March 2012, Baker did not deny his online interactions with that girl. He blamed drinking, depression and poor relationships for his actions, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Baker, who was arrested on September 7 last year, pleaded guilty in April. In addition to prison, Baker was ordered to serve a 15-year term of supervised release following his incarceration and to register as a sex offender.
