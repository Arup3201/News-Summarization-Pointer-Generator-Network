A U.S. Air Force pilot has told how he attacked people at random after taking prescribed amphetamines, as new figures reveal that the number of active-duty troops taking sedatives and antidepressants has increased eightfold since 2005.

Last year, Patrick Burke was flying a B1 bomber from the Persian Gulf back home to South Dakota, while taking a tablet of Dexedrine every four hours during the 19-hour journey.

After landing the aircraft, the father-of-one attacked a fellow crewman at random, striking him in the 
head and yelling incomprehensible phrases about being kidnapped, 
according to the Los Angeles Times.

He then directed his anger at their female driver, wrestling her to the ground, and telling her: ‘Me and my platoon are looking for terrorists.' He grabbed her keys, drove away and crashed the car into a guardrail.

Burke was charged with auto theft, drunk driving and two counts of assault.

But - in an unprecedented ruling - he was found not guilty 'by reason of lack of mental responsibility' after four military psychologists concluded the young lieutenant suffered from 'polysubstance-induced delirium', caused by alcohol, lack of sleep and the 40 milligrams of Dexedrine.

'Three drinks over an entire evening is not enough to black somebody out, but I don't remember 99 per cent of what happened over the rest of that evening,' Burke told the newspaper. 'It was kind of like I was misfiring on the cylinders.'

Questions: Staff Sgt. Robert Bales is accused of murdering 17 Afghan civilians but his lawyers would like to find out if her was taking any medication

The rare ruling comes as new figures obtained by the Los Angeles Times reveal that more than 110,000 active-duty Army troops last year were taking prescribed antidepressants, narcotics, sedatives, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety drugs.

Chad Eric Oligschlaeger,
a Marine corporal based at Twentynine Palms, began showing symptoms of 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after his first tour in Iraq.

Despite military doctors recommending that he receive in-patient treatment, he was sent on his second tour. There he displayed more pronounced
symptoms of PTSD including, nightmares and hallucinations, and was 
prescribed 12 different types of medication.

Two months before the 21-year-old was due to return home, he was found dead on the floor of his room in the barracks. An autopsy concluded that the death was accidental due to multiple-drug toxicity, or interactions among too many drugs.

Pfc. David Lawrence was just 20 years old when he shot a Taliban commander in the face during a schizophrenic episode.

Just weeks before the incident, he 
had been flown to a Combat Stress Clinic where he was prescribed two 
psychotropic drugs, Trazodone and Zoloft, and returned to his 
base. His condition worsened, with the voices inside his head, and his hallucinations, intensifying.

Lawrence's prison sentence was 
later reduced from 12-and-a-half to ten years after it was shown that he
suffered from schizophrenia and PTSD. Psychiatric 
experts concluded that he was 'unable to appreciate the nature and 
quality or wrongfulness of his conduct at the time of the alleged 
criminal misconduct.'

Moreover, nearly 8 per cent of the Army is now on sedatives and more than 6 per cent is on antidepressants, reflecting an eightfold increase since 2005.

Bart Billings, a former military 
psychologist, told the newspaper: 'We have never medicated our 
troops to the extent we are doing now.... And I don't believe the 
current increase in suicides and homicides in the military is a 
coincidence.'

This had led many military lawyers and psychiatrists to link their clients' aberrant behavior to the prescription medications they are taking.

In the most recent case, the attorneys of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who was accused of murdering 17 Afghan civilians, have asked for a list of all the medicines the 38-year-old was taking.

But US military officials claim that the use of drugs in the army is comparable to that by the civilians, arguing that prescribing medications is a calculated - but, at times, necessary - risk.

'It's not that we're using them more frequently or any differently,' Col. Carol Labadie, a pharmacy consultant for the Army surgeon general, told the newspaper. 'As with any medication, you have to look at weighing the risk versus the benefits of somebody going on a medication.'

David Rudd, director of the National Center for Veterans Studies, believes medication is necessary in many cases.

'I will tell you that we currently run a treatment program at Fort Carson where we're treating suicide attempters, and medicines are critical sometimes early in the process of treatment.

'Now, I will tell you that we don't want people to be on medications for indefinite periods of time, but I certainly have seen medicine save lives,' he told Public Radio International.
