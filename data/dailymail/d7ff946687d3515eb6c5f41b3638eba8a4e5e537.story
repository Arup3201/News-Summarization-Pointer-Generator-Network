A teenage British Muslim whose brother died fighting in war-torn Syria has also been killed, their father said today.

Jaffar Deghayes, 17, is believed to have died at the weekend after leaving home near Brighton earlier this year in a bid to overthrow dictator Bashar Al-Assad's government.

His brother, Abdullah, 18, died in Latakia province in April after leaving the UK in January to reportedly take up arms with Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda-affiliated group.

Yesterday the pair's brother, Amer, 20, who also travelled to Syria, relayed news of the death of Jaffar to their father, Abubaker Deghayes, 45, back home in Saltdean, East Sussex.

Mr Deghayes said: ‘Amer sent me a message via the internet. All I know is that (Jaffar) was fighting against Assad and was killed in battle.

‘I don't know much else. I can only hope and pray to God to accept him and have mercy on him.’

The Deghayes brothers are the nephew of Omar Deghayes, who was held by the U.S. as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo Bay detention camp from 2002 to 2007 after he was arrested in Pakistan.

He wrote in Arabic on Facebook confirming the boy's death, saying: ‘As you grieve, know that we are remembering you and honouring the memory of a sincere and truthful young man (deceased).'

BBC Newsnight reporter Secunder Kermani also said on Twitter: 'I spoke to Jaffer [sic] Deghayes a few times whilst he was in Syria, very polite and friendly person with me... Poor family.'

Following the death of Abdullah, counter-terrorism officers raided the Deghayes' family home in May and seized material after a warrant was issued under the Terrorism Act 2000.

There was no answer at the family home today and all but one pair of curtains remained drawn.

A woman who lives nearby, but did not wish to be named, said: ‘To lose one son is awful, but to lose two so close together is unimaginable. The family must be going through a terrible time.  

'I don't understand why these teenagers are putting their lives at risk like this.’

Sussex Police urged anyone who has concerns or information about anyone locally planning to travel to Syria or Iraq to contact the force.

A police statement said: ‘The south east counter-terrorism unit and Sussex Police are aware of recent social media postings reporting the death of a man who may have come from Brighton during fighting in either Syria or Iraq.

‘Whilst we will not comment on individual cases, reports like these remind everyone that the situation in Syria and Iraq is unsafe and that risk of injury, death or abduction remains for anyone travelling to that area.

‘The Government advice continues to be that no one should travel to these war zones and that the most effective way to help the affected population is through humanitarian support.

‘Anyone locally who has concerns or information about someone who is planning to travel to Syria or Iraq for whatever reason or are hearing or seeing negative tensions within communities can contact the Sussex Police prevent engagement team.’

Abubaker Deghayes has previously said that his three sons could have helped the cause in Syria from the UK by lobbying the government.

But in a film shot by Vice News this year, Amer Deghayes said he had no intention of returning to Britain, adding: ‘My work here is not done. I came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice, and we still haven't reached the goal yet.’

He added: ‘I'm in the Syrian civil war because I believe it's my duty to fight here ...The Muslim nation is like one body. If one part complains, the other parts react, so I don't see it as a Syrian conflict. I see it as an Islamic conflict.’

Speaking in June Mr Deghayes, said: 'Amer, Jaffar, if you see me or this interview please, please come back home. Enough. This war has taken away Abdullah already. 

Family: Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) followed soon after

The Deghayes' parents had insisted their boys are not terrorists, and simply went to Syria to protect the weak

'I'd like to see you live longer. I said [to them] "why are you going there, it's not worth it? You have to stick to helping in the refugee camps and doing the humanitarian work". I am scared for my children. I don't want to lose them obviously. But they are becoming men now.'

After Abdullah died in April, his father described him as a 'martyr' and revealed he only learned of the death when he saw tributes on Facebook.

Mr Deghayes said at the time: 'He was a youngster who didn't communicate a lot. With parents, once they grow, they don't tell you much about their lives.'

And asked whether he believed Abdullah was a martyr, Mr Deghayes replied: 'Of course I think, as a Muslim, that my son is a martyr. Anyone who dies for a just cause is a martyr.'

Counter-terrorism investigators have expressed concern about aspiring British jihadis travelling to Syria and becoming radicalised.

It emerged this month that a fourth man from Portsmouth, Hampshire - Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 19 - died fighting in Kobani.

Three others from the same city - Iftekar Jaman, 23, Mamunur Roshid, 24, and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in October last year.

In January alone, 16 people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences related to Syria compared with 24 arrests in the whole of last year.

Father-of-three: Abdul Waheed Majeed (pictured at a refugee camp on the border of Turkey and Syria), from Crawley, West Sussex, is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February

Others who have died include one man suspected of carrying out a suicide attack. Abdul Waheed Majeed is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February.

The 41-year-old married father-of-three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria.

A Foreign Office spokesman said today: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Syria. The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended.

'As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.' 

Around 25 Britons are believed to have died in the conflict in Syria and Iraq, and they are being killed at a rate of more than one every three weeks, according to researchers at King’s College London.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said last week that five British extremists are joining ISIS every week, with more than 500 already having travelled to join the conflict.
