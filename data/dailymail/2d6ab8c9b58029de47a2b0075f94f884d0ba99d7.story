An Australian model has taken a stand after a swimwear label used pictures of her without permission and Photoshopped her to appear considerably slimmer than she is in real life.

Meaghan Kausman, 23, a fashion student from Melbourne, was photographed in an underwater shoot with photographer Pip Summerville two weeks ago wearing a Fella Swim bikini.

Ms Summerville shared some photographs from the shoot on Instagram and the next day she and Ms Kausman were shocked to find that Fella Swim had posted a Photoshopped version of one of the pictures that made Ms Kausman appear kilograms lighter than she does in real life.

Spot the difference: Meaghan Kausman was shocked when a photograph taken in an underwater shoot was reposted by a swimwear company after they had Photoshopped her body to make it appear much slimmer

'My jaw literally dropped,' Ms Kausman told Daily Mail Australia. 'Straight away I messaged Pip… we were incredibly disappointed that they took the photo without permission. They took something and altered it because they didn't see it as beautiful,' she said.

Swimwear label Fella Swim had sent Ms Kausman a bikini to use for the shoot but no money changed hands, with neither Ms Kausman nor Ms Summerville being paid for the photographs.

Ms Kausman decided to speak out about what had occurred and uploaded side-by-side pictures comparing the original image with the Photoshopped one and wrote a post criticising the changes.

'They had drastically altered my body, thinning out my stomach and thighs in an attempt to box me into the cultural ideal of beauty,' she wrote.

'My body is a size 8, not a size 4. That's my body! I refuse to stand by and allow ANY company or person to perpetuate the belief that "thinner is better". All women are beautiful, and we come in different shapes and sizes! It is NOT OKAY to alter a woman's body to make it look thinner. EVER!'

Meaghan Kausman is a part-time model as well as studying fashion at RMIT in Melbourne

The photographer, Pip Summerville, who is considering legal action against the swimwear company for breach of copyright, told Daily Mail Australia that she was 'blown away' when she saw the retouched image.

'They didn't ask for my permission [and] it completely changed the image, it just destroyed Meaghan's appearance. They basically cut her in half and biologically speaking that's not what a human body would look like in that position,' she said.

Ms Kausman said she contacted Fella Swim before publishing the comparison shots to Instagram and did not want to shame the company, but when she did not hear back from them she decided to go public with her grievance.

'Unfortunately there has not been a response from Fella [Swim]. It's really upsetting. I would never want to shame a company or embarrass someone,' she added.

'I emailed them before I uploaded it, and [told them] that I didn't feel it was the right thing for them to do. But I haven't heard back and it's been over a week and a half.

'They probably feel that I'm trying to get back at them and I'm not, I'm just trying to highlight the belief that thinner is better and girls have to look a certain way that doesn't exist.'

Ms Kausman was wearing a Fella Swim bikini for the shoot, but neither she nor the photographer received payment for the photographs and they claim the image was posted on the Fella Swim Instagram account without permission

Ms Kausman emailed Fella Swim to express her unhappiness with the retouched image but says she did not hear back from the company

Ms Kausman, whose father is a prominent body image advocate, said she felt upset about the message the Photoshopped images sent about appearance

Fella Swim released a statement to Daily Mail Australia saying that they acknowledged the original sources when they posted the image to Instagram, and  sent an immediate apology to Ms Kausman and Ms Summerville when contacted regarding the image - something that both women deny.

They added the company does not promote a negative body image or believe in glamourising skinny models - saying they make swimwear for a variety of body shapes and often post pictures of models not wearing makeup.

'There was no way, ever meant to be a negative connotation derived from the image, and the intention of re-posting the image was to draw attention to the beauty of the shot, and encourage others to also follow and support Meaghan and Pip's work,' the statement read.

Ms Kausman, whose father is Dr Rick Kausman, a prominent advocate for healthy body image, told Daily Mail Australia she is pleased to have been able to speak out about body image on behalf of other women.

 'People have been so appreciative. I got a couple of emails from people suffering eating disorders saying thank you. I'm so thankful that people are supportive,' she said.

Fella Swim released a statement saying they credited both Ms Kausman and the photographer Pip Summerville when the reposted the image and apologised to the women after they objected, something both women deny
