The euro crisis has turned violent in Germany after a shady terror group torched a car belonging to the EU finance chief tasked with sorting out the Greek financial catastrophe.

German left-wing extremists claimed responsibility for the Sunday night arson blaze which destroyed a car used by Horst Reichenbach's wife.

Reichenbach is leader of the EU task force on Greece and therefore seen by left-wingers as responsible for the continued misery of the Greek people as the country remains poised on a painful exit from the euro.

The extremists are named after the dog Loukanikos, or sausage, who was pictured barking in front of Greek riot police in central Athens

His wife Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, a social democrat EU politician, had parked the BMW outside the family home near Potsdam when it was set ablaze.

The attackers also threw stones at his house as well as bottles filled with red paint that left marks on the outside walls.

Berlin, just 25 miles away, has been the scene of numerous luxury car arson attacks in recent months but police were initially puzzled about the attack on Reichenbach's car until the group responsible admitted it in a letter to a city newspaper.

Continued unrest: Protesters throw petrol bombs at riot police in front of the Greek Parliament in Athens

An Italian anarchist group that has claimed responsibility for shooting the boss of a nuclear engineering firm threatened on Wednesday to target Prime Minister Mario Monti.    

The group, calling itself the Olga Nucleus of the Informal Anarchist Federation-International Revolutionary Front, said in a statement sent to a newspaper in southern Italy that Monti was among seven remaining targets after Roberto Adinolfi, boss of Ansaldo Nucleare, was shot in the leg last week.   

The attack fuelled rising concern about a return of political violence in Italy because of economic hardship and increasing opposition to austerity measures implemented by Monti's government.    

The group called itself the 'Friends of Loukanikos' - a reference to a dog whose name in English means 'Sausage' who has been pictured at the thick of the action in recent Greek riots. He is understood to be a stray.

'We say to Monti that he is one of the seven remaining and that the people have no interest in staying in Europe, saving the banks and helping to balance the accounts of a state that squandered money for its own interests,' the statement said.  

The group called itself the 'Friends of Loukanikos' - a reference to a dog whose name in English means 'Sausage' who has been pictured at the thick of the action in recent Greek riots. He is understood to be a stray.

The Berliner Morgenpost received the letter which read; 'The target of the attack was not Roth-Behrendt, but her husband Reichenbach.

'As leader of the EU task force on Greece, he is responsible for holding the Greek authorities to austerity measures, which have extremely worsened the lives of Greek people.'

Further threats were made in the letter to the European Union, International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, as well as various multinational firms.

For Germany, the attack is a significant ratcheting up of public anger over the entire Greece issue and the wider eurozone problems.

Germany fought an urban war against leftist guerllias in the 70's and 80's that polarised the country.

At the moment far-right violence is seen as more of a threat, but authorities are keen to choke off support for violent left-wingers as quickly as possible.

German police admitted they had not heard of the group until the letter was sent to the newspaper.

'We are pursuing all avenues,' said a spokesman for the local prosecutor.
