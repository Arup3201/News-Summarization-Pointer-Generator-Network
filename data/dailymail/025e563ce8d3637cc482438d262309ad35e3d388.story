A teenager says he's grateful for 'a second chance in life' after breaking his neck in a freak swimming pool accident.

Tristan Green, 18, of Colchester, Essex, was paralysed from the chest down after he dived into a 4ft pool and hit his head on the bottom.

He said: 'Some days I don't like the sound of being in a wheelchair but, at the end of the day, I have been given a second chance in life. I could have died.'

'I could have died': Tristan, pictured with his father James, has endured his injuries with stoicism and optimism. The 18-year-old is able to speak about his accident for the first time following windpipe surgery

He added: 'It is hard keeping a positive attitude and sometimes I have down days.

'I want to be the big brother my little brother can look up to and I feel like I am not going to be that big brother any more, but that is life.'

Tristan has been able to speak about the accident for the first time, after surgeons performed a tracheostomy to put a hole in his windpipe.

Speaking from his bed at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, he described what happene on the day of the accident, July 26.

He was at a friend's house with his girlfriend and they had been swimming in a pool in the back garden in  Colchester

Optimism: The teenager is being fed liquefied food through a tube and admitted he cannot wait to eat a Big Mac as soon as his body is ready to take on solids. Pictured with parents James and Dawn

Tristan said: 'I climbed the ladder up the side to dive into the pool.

'My head hit the bottom of the pool, I jolted my neck, that's when I broke it.

'It didn't hurt. I floated to the top of the water face down and was shaking my head to try and get some attention.

'I couldn't move, I thought I was going to drown.'

Sense of humor: Tristan gurns for the camera despite his predicament

Tristan's girlfriend Lauren Faulkner, 18, turned him over and along with her friend and his mother, pulled Tristan from the water and put him in a garden chair.

Lauren's father arrived, and spotting a lump on the back of Tristan's neck, decided an ambulance was needed.

Medics called the fire brigade because Tristan was sitting in a chair and needed to be moved onto a spine board.

They cut him out and he was flown to Addenbrooke's.

Tristan said.'The best part about it was having a helicopter ride up to the hospital.'

The full extent of his injuries, which included breaking his neck in two places and a bruised spinal cord, will not be known for about a year.

He is on a waiting list for Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire where he could spend up to nine months on a rehabilitation programme.

He is being fed liquefied food through a tube and admitted he cannot wait to eat a Big Mac as soon as his body is ready to take on solids.

His weight has plummeted 22lbs to 9st.

Tristan, who can drink his favourites - Dr Pepper or orange Lucozade - also undergoes daily physiotherapy and is visited every other day by parents James, 38, and Dawn, 42.

He also has four siblings, Scott, 25, Zoe, 23, Jodie, 22, and Harvey, two.

The nurses have become his friends, keeping his morale going on the days his family have not been able to visit and occupying him with conversation, TV, music and DVDs. 

Speaking last month, his father, James, 38, said: 'Unless there is a complete miracle, he will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.'

He told the Colchester Gazette: 'I look at pictures of me and him playing football and break down.

'We have had some hope because he wiggled his left toe and moved his right foot but it could be 18 months before we know the full effects.

'We need to be supportive for him to get through this.'

The Facebook page his family set up, Tristan's Road to Recovery, has more than 2,000 'Likes' and has had global messages of support.

Tristan said: 'I am still here and hopefully I can walk again but there is the possibility I am not going to.

'I said to my mum and dad: 'As long as it's a pukka wheelchair.

'I hope I can get some feeling in my legs so I can still play football with my little brother when he is older.'

Colchester United gave fan Tristan a signed shirt and he thanked the club and said: 'I want to say a massive thank you to my girlfriend and everyone who has supported me.

'My family, my girlfriend's friend and his mother for helping me out of the pool, the air ambulance and the fire brigade.'
