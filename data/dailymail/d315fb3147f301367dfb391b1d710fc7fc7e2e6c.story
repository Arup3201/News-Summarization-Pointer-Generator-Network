Henry Jackson, whose company bought failing retailer Comet, could make millions on the sale of the firm, while thousands face losing their jobs

An American financier who bought Comet for £2 could now make millions from its sale, despite leading it into administration.

Multi-millionaire Henry Jackson bought the electricals company nine months ago and now more than 6,600 staff are facing redundancy after it went bust last week.

Yet because his company OpCapita are secured creditors, he could still rake in a large portion of a potential 
£50m liquidation sale of Comet.

John Gorle, of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, said: 'This will really stick in the craw of Comet's 6,600 staff and it should also anger taxpayers, who could end up footing the bill for any unpaid wages and redundancy pay.'

But Opcaptia say it took significant steps to turn the business around for the long term, while facing an uphill struggle. A spokesman added that Comet’s large credit insurers withdrew cover shortly before it completed the acquisition, meaning it had to pay up front for stock.

The financier is married to Canadian-born pop singer Stacey Jackson, who has worked with rap star Snoop Dogg.

While Comet's British staff were considering life without a job, she tweeted yesterday about having successful meetings in Los Angeles and her 'addiction' to low fat snack pop-chips.

Comet's demise hit home after it refused to accept a £500 gift card from a four-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer.

Samuel Horton was left heartbroken when his gift card, given to him by the Family Fund charity in order to buy an iPad to help him complete school homework, was rejected.

But kind-hearted John Alexander, 70, from 
Rochdale, decided to give Samuel £500 cash for the iPad after reading about the 
schoolboy's sad plight.

The charity fundraiser said: 'I was touched by 
this story.

A union spokesman and an MP have condemned OpCapita making a profit on the sale while 6,600 staff face losing their jobs.

'I’ve had ups and downs in life, like we all 
have, but God has been good to me, and I have always tried to help along the 
way.'

Multi-millionaire New Yorker Henry Jackson, 48, runs London-based OpCapita, which he founded under the name Merchant Equity Partners in 2006.

It has becme well-known for buying up struggling companies, including Comet, MFI and the Game group,

Married to singer Stacey Jackson and has four children with her, he was educated at the University of Pennsylvania before going into business.

Before setting up his own business, he was a Managing Director of Deutsche Bank and head of its European Consumer and Retail Group. He also held senior positions at Credit Suisse First Boston.

In 1995 he was named as one of New York's  most successful under-40s and is the grandson of  Henry L. Jackson, who co-founded Esquire Magazine.

Administrator Deloitte last night 
said it would accept gift cards and fulfil purchases made before the 
administration where stock was available.

The Independent says that Deloitte is considering a stock fire-sale this week, and branches could close before Christmas.

OpCapita, then Merchant Equity Partners, acquired the flat-pack furniture retailer MFI for £1 in 2006. When MFI collapsed into administration in 2008 OpCapita reported that it made a 'small profit' from the chain.

Alan Johnson, Hull Labour MP, where Comet said it will close its call centre at the cost of 240 jobs and move it to Bristol, said: 'Comet's employees seem to be the unfortunate victims of a short-term investment strategy which is not untypical of this kind of private equity company.

Staff at collapsed chain Comet were handed the chance of joining a rival today after Dixons outlined plans to take on seasonal staff.

The owner of PC World and Currys has delayed its normal Christmas recruitment drive, when it expects to take on an additional 2,000 seasonal shop staff, to offer Comet staff the opportunity to join the business.

Dixons Retail Group chief executive Sebastian James said more than 500 Comet staff had already approached Dixons, and he hoped the company could get as many staff as possible.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'We do think that Comet colleagues know our business, know our customers and know our products very well.'

Four-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer Samuel Horton was inconsolable when Comet refused his £500 gift card is celebrating - after a complete stranger stepped in and donated him the cash.

The youngster was given the generous gift card by the Family Fund charity in order to buy an iPad to help him complete school homework.

But when his mother Maria Horton, 32, (pictured together right) tried to use the card it was refused by Comet, which collapsed into administration last week.

Samuel, from Plymouth, Devon, who has just started school, needs the 
iPad to help with his schoolwork as he has extreme difficulty writing 
because his hand shakes.

However kind hearted John Alexander, 70, from Rochdale, decided to give Samuel £500 cash for the iPad after reading about the schoolboy's sad plight.

The charity fundraiser said: 'I was touched by this story.

'I’ve had ups and downs in life, like we all have, but God has been good to me, and I have always tried to help along the way.'

Mother-of-two Mrs Horton, who said Samuel had been looking forward to getting the iPad after being shown the program that will help him by an outreach worker, was astounded by the generosity.

'I am overwhelmed,' she said. 'If anyone else does want to help they could give to the Family Fund. 'They are a charity that makes a difference to people’s lives.'

Mrs Horton said that the family Fund charity are negotiating with administrators to get the cards reinstated after other beneficiaries of the charity had similar problems.

Deloitte has said overnight that outstanding vouchers will be honoured.
