The sun is entering an unusually heavy period of solar activity, and the poor planet Earth is bearing the brunt of it.

Luckily for us earthlings, any disturbance we experienced from the latest outbursts were simply an extraordinary display of the aurora borealis, or the Northern Lights.

The spectacular lights display, caused by radiation hitting the upper reaches of our atmosphere, are not being true to their name after being seen as far south as Iowa, Nebraska and Maryland in the United States which, relative to Europe, are about as far South as southern Spain and the Mediterranean.

Solar flares: A European visitor to the Badlands, South Dakota, took these pictures of the aurora, much further south than they should be

Aurora were seen as far south as Ocean City, Maryland. This photo was taken by a camper on the shores of Assateague Island, facing north

The speckled face of the sun: These sunspots, particularly 1504, have peaked over the last few days

In the early hours of Saturday morning, the combined effects of two coronal 
mass ejections from a sunspot which Nasa named AR 1504, passed NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer
 (ACE) spacecraft on the way toward Earth's protective magnetic bubble, 
the magnetosphere.

ACE is approximately 900,000 miles from Earth and can
 detect such incoming shocks about 30-45 minutes before they hit the 
magnetosphere - a handy early-warning system.

Simulations performed at NASA Goddard's Space 
Weather Center indicate that the disturbance strongly compressed the 
magnetopause, ultimately to a minimum of approximately 24,000 miles from
 Earth's surface at 6:28 PM EDT.

This is an altitude some 2,000 miles 
lower than spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit.

The Solar Dynamics Observatory captured this image of an M1.2 class flare on June 13, 2012. The sun is shown here in teal as this is the color typically used to represent light in the 131 Angstrom wavelength, a wavelength particularly good for observing flares

The changing shape
 of Earth's magnetopause also influenced the aurora, causing bright 
aurora to be seen at lower latitudes than normal.

An active region on the sun, numbered AR 1504, rotated into view over the left side of the sun on June 10, 2012.

The region fired off flares and two coronal mass ejections on June 13 and June 14, 2012.

The first flare lasted for a relatively long three hours, peaking on June 13, 2012.

The associated CME traveled at approximately 375 miles per second and is directed toward Earth.

The second M-class flare was also a long-duration flare, and it peaked on June 14, 2012.

The CME associated with this flare 
travelled much faster â€“ preliminary analysis at Goddard's Space Weather 
Center indicated it was traveling at speeds of approximately 800 miles 
per second.

Big bang: The longest and highest-energy light ever emitted from a solar blast was detected on March 7 by a Nasa telescope

Going the distance: Fermi's LAT detected high-energy gamma rays for about 20 hours, two-and-a-half times longer than any event on record

The longest and highest-energy light ever emitted from a solar blast was detected earlier this year.

Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope recorded the powerful eruption on the surface of the sun on March 7.

The flare 
produced such an outpouring of gamma rays - a form of light with even 
greater energy than X-rays - that the sun briefly became the brightest 
object in the gamma-ray sky.

The powerful March 7 flare, which 
earned a classification of X5.4 based on the peak intensity of its 
X-rays, is the strongest eruption so far observed by Fermi's Large Area 
Telescope (LAT).

Nicola Omodei, an astrophysicist at Stanford University in California, said: 'For
 most of Fermi's four years in orbit, its LAT saw the sun as a faint, 
steady gamma-ray source thanks to the impacts of high-speed particles 
called cosmic rays.

'Now we're beginning to see what the sun itself can do.'

The sun's activity waxes and wanes on a roughly 11-year space weather cycle.

This cycle began in 2008 and is expected to hit its peak in 2013.
