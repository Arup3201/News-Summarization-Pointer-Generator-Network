It is not often you are granted an audience with God's representative on Earth.

But it seems actor Steve Coogan, a self-confessed former user of prostitutes and cocaine, was not meeting Pope Francis to ask for his sins to be absolved.

Coogan - who was notorious for his tangled love life, penchant for lap-dancers and taste for Class A drugs - had travelled to the Vatican for a meeting with the head of the Catholic Church to promote his latest movie.

Holy meeting: Steve Coogan introduces Philomena Lee to Pope Francis, left, before a private audience to discuss a campaign to highlight historical forced adoption

The 48-year-old Catholic was joined by Philomena Lee, whose three-year-old son was taken from her and sold by nuns for adoption.

Her harrowing story, and her subsequent 50-year search to be reunited with her missing child, has been turned into an Oscar-nominated film co-written, produced and staring Coogan. 

But while Coogan has spoken of how a man of the cloth once helped him overcome his daemons -  telling the Mail On Sunday in 2009: ‘I went to rehab in America because I was going off the rails a bit. And I did once see a priest, but religion wasn’t discussed in any of the sessions - he was more of a highly qualified psychotherapist’ - it seems the meeting with Pope Francis focused on the content and issues raised by his new film.

In 1952, when Philomena Lee became 
pregnant as a teenager in Ireland, she was sent to a ‘Mother and Baby 
Home’ to be taken care of.

When her son was three years old, he was taken away, sold for adoption and sent to America.

Although Philomena and her son looked for each other for many years, they were kept apart and were never reunited.

Speaking after the audience, Ms Lee said that meeting the Pope has finally brought her ‘release’ after carrying the guilt of having a baby out of wedlock for more than six decades.

The Irish woman, said she finally felt ‘forgiveness’ for the mortal sin of becoming an unmarried mother.

She said: ‘You were made to feel so bad for having a baby out of wedlock. It was such a sin. But yesterday after all these years I felt such a sense of relief that I had finally been forgiven.’

Mrs
 Lee said: 'It was such an honour and something I would never have 
expected to do in my life. He made me feel so good inside. It was such a
 release'

Vatican 
officials told her that the Pope probably would see the film. The movie 
is based on a book by British journalist Martin Sixsmith who helped Mrs 
Lee track down her son Anthony in America fifty years after he was taken
 from her and sold for adoption. Tragically Anthony had just died.

The
 film’s lead actor and screenwriter Steve Coogan, who played Sixsmith, 
said that the Vatican seemed ready to accept criticism and 'acknowledge 
the mistakes of the past'.

Back in the 1990s Coogan, who sprang to 
fame as the fictional failing media star Alan Partridge, was dumped by 
solicitor Anna Cole, the mother of his daughter, after affairs 
with three women, including a topless model who later revealed how 
Coogan showered the bed with £5,000 in £10 notes and told her: ‘Lie on 
them. Go on, lie on them.’

He later explained the embarrassing moment as ‘me being crassly ironic about what you do when you’re famous’.

A
 brief marriage to society beauty Caroline Hickman ended after just 18 
months in 2004, soon after the comedian was exposed for having a 
cocaine-fuelled encounter with two lapdancers. In typical style, Coogan 
laughed the incident off, saying: ‘I was appalled and shocked to find 
they were lapdancers. I was under the impression they were Latvian 
refugees who needed shelter for the night.’

In 2005 he had a now notorious two-week liaison with Courtney Love, the actress, ex-junkie and widow of rock star Kurt Cobain.

According
 to Love, the pair enjoyed drug-fuelled sex, during which he allegedly 
filled their hotel room with sex toys and Viagra and wanted a prostitute
 to join them in bed.

When the
 brief affair ended, Love launched an angry outburst branding Coogan an 
inveterate substance-abuser and a ‘sex addict’.

Now
 older, and hopefully wiser, Coogan has admitted he suffers from an 
addictive personality but is determined to bury the drug and sex 
scandals of the past  – not just for his own sake, but for the sake of 
his daughter.

After 
turning 40, he said: ‘It’s time to clean up my act. My parents are 
acclimatised to reading bad stuff about me, but [my daughter] is only 
nine years old.’ 

'[The
 officials who watched the film said that] its values: Philomena’s 
forgiveness and serenity in spite of misdemeanours committed aginst her 
was in completely in line with values of church and message of Francis, 
which is a new message of encouraging forgiveness and acknowledging the 
mistakes of the past.'

‘They
 didn’t see the criticism as an attack but they saw it as the criticisms
 of a friend, as constructive criticism,’ he added.

The
 screening coincided with a devastating report by the UN into the 
Vatican’s response to the child abuse scandals including forced 
adoptions in Ireland.

But
 former nurse Mrs Lee said she had realised that anger would have only 
brought her ‘sorrow and sadness’. ‘Anthony will be 62 this year so how 
could I go through all of life holding a grudge?’, she explained.

‘At
 the beginning ... I was very hurt and very sad. But then I went into 
psychiatric nursing, so I saw sorrow and such sadness that comes out of 
bitterness and unforgiveness so I gradually sank my hurt into the 
background.’

Emotional: Philomena Lee, pictured with daughter Jane Libberton, has said that meeting the Pope had brought her 'release' from the guilt of having a child out of wedlock

Her story 
has inspired daughter Jane to form a pressure group 
www.thephilomenaproject.org to campaign for the release of adoption 
records by the Irish government.

Mrs
 Lee said after the film many people affected making contact to ask if 
she knew their mother. But she explained: ‘ When I was in the centre you
 had to lose your identity. I was given the name Marcella.

'We
 weren’t allowed to talk about anything that happened in the world. So 
we didn’t tell one another our secrets. We were so ashamed of the fact 
that we were there having a baby out of wedlock. We didn’t know one 
another’s past histories or future histories.

The film, based on a book The Lost 
Child of Philomena Lee, has received 
largely positive reviews, it is not without controversy.

Sister
 Julie Rose of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Roscrea, County 
Tipperary, where Philomena stayed, claimed the film was misleading.

Ms Lee, accompanied by her daughter Jane Libberton and Coogan, discussed the Philomena Project with the Pope.

The
 project is calling on the Irish government to enact legislation to open
 up adoption records and reunite mothers separated from their children 
as a result of forced adoption.

It was set up to harness this increased awareness to the pain and loss which thousands of young women experienced over decades.

Among
 its objectives, the project is urging for the Irish government to 
release all information it has on the illicit adoptions, to assist in 
helping mothers and their children to find one another, and to create a 
place for these individuals to tell their stories in an effort to find 
closure.
