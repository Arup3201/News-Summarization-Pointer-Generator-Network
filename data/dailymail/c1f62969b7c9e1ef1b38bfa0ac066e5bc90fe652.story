Former prime minister Gough Whitlam's childhood home was expected to be demolished within weeks

The demolition of former prime minister Gough Whitlam's birthplace has been put on hold.

Mr Whitlam, who died on Tuesday aged 98, was born at the house in Kew, Melbourne. His parents sold it when he was one year old and the family moved to Sydney. 

The three-bedroom home, which went under the hammer for $3.3 million last year, was given the tick of approval to be ripped down just one week before Whitlam passed away on Tuesday.  

The demolition order was lodged for the 46 Rowland street site, known as 'Ngara' in April, before an application for heritage protection was rejected by the office of Planning Minister Matthew Guy.

However, Mr Guy said on Thursday he had applied for an interim protection order to put the demolition on hold, a move granted by the Heritage Council.

City of Boroondara mayor Coral Ross said the council was pleased 'this valuable piece of Australia's history' was being protected for now.

The demolition will be on hold for about four months while the issue of heritage protection is examined.

Mr Guy said the interim protection order meant works on the property had to stop immediately and it would allow for a fresh consideration of the property's cultural significance given Mr Whitlam's death.

He said he had no direct power as planning minister to intervene and any person may apply for an interim protection order as he did.

Whitlam's parents took out a house mortgage at the beginning of 1915 and the home was built by May that same year.

The house, built in 1915, at 46 Rowland Street has been relatively untouched since the 1920s

The home in the affluent suburb of Kew was sold for $3.3million in November last year

Boroondara council attempted to save the home after declaring it was of 'local individual heritage significance' due to Whitlam living in the house for the first two years of his life until the family moved to Sydney with his father's job in 1918.  

Following an investigation, the council deemed the home as heritage-worthy due to Whitlam's childhood links to the property before it lodged a heritage protection request to the Victorian Planning Minister in May.

However, the planning department rejected the application in September because the demolition order was already approved before receiving the heritage request, the ABC reported. 

Whitlam's parents built the home in 1915 after taking out a mortgage

Following the sale last year, the home was listed on realestate.com.au as displaying 'splendid original character and grand room proportions offer endless scope to renovate/extend or perhaps create a luxurious new home.' 

Former owner Gerald Swinnerton, who sold the house in January, met Whitlam, along with his parents, when the politician visited his childhood home in the 1960s.

'He turned up in a Commonwealth car,' Mr Swinnerton told the ABC.

'We had afternoon tea together, and found him to be a charming and congenial fellow.'

The Whitlams took a mortgage out from the State Savings Bank of Victoria on 30 January 1915 to build the family home which was completed by May that same year, the Property Observer reported.

The announcement of Whitlam's birth was published as taking place at Ngara, Rowland Street, East Kew. 

Legend has it - that Whitlam was delivered on the kitchen table in the home the following year after it was built.

However, two years after his birth, the family uprooted to Sydney after his father, Fred Whitlam, was promoted to deputy Crown solicitor

Mr Swinnerton said before he and his brother made the sale they expressed their preference for the new owner to only make renovations to the house.

'It's my view that a plaque should be placed in the pavement outside the house,' he said.

Neighbour Oliver Barrett said he expected the house, which has been relatively untouched since the 1920s, to be pulled down within a couple of weeks as the demolition process had already begun.

He said the fact that many people had visited the home since Whitlam died proved its historical significance.

'We'll lose a large bit of Australian history,' he told the ABC. 

The house currently features a large formal living and dining room - along with a sun room and box and bay windows.
