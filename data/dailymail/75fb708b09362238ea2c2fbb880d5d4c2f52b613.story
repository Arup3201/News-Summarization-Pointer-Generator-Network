A joint smoking Romanian mum has lost custody of her one-year-old baby after tests showed he was 'unusually sleepy' because  he was getting cannabis from her milk.

The drug was discovered in the boy's blood after social workers were called by police to take the child into their care.

Police had found 60 grams of dried cannabis ready for sale, and 3kg of green cannabis, after raiding the home of the boy's parents, Diana Curelaru, 25, and her husband Bogdan, 30, in the city of Satu Mare in north-western Romania.

Ms Curelaru told social workers she had no idea she was passing cannabis on to her baby through her breast milk, but said she had noticed her child seemed 'unusually placid and slept most of the time'

When they arrested the couple they discovered the baby asleep and called social workers as the child appeared unusually sleepy.

A blood test revealed cannabis in the child's blood that had apparently been passed on from its mother.

Police spokesman Radu Ionescu said the couple had set up a drug operation with three other people selling one gram bags of cannabis for £10, in and around Satu Mare. 

He said: 'The couple were heavy users themselves and funded their lifestyle by growing the cannabis on the roof.'

Police said the couple were involved in a drug dealing operation; Ms Curelaru was arrested but later released, but Mr Curelaru has been charged with drug trafficking

Satu Mare Child Care manager, Eugenia Ardelean, said Ms Curelaru believed smoking cannabis was 'harmless and had no idea it was being passed on to her child through her milk'.

Ms Ardelean said: 'She did say that the baby had seemed unusually placid and slept most of the time, often needing to be woken to feed it.'

The child was initially taken into care before being released to his grandmother, who has agreed to act as his guardian, authorities said. 

Ms Curelaru has been released by police but Mr Curelaru is still under arrest and faces charges of drug trafficking.
