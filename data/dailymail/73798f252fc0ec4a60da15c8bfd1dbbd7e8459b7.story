Bosses at Coronation Street are reportedly planning a new storyline in which Faye Windass (pictured) falls pregnant

Coronation Street bosses are planning a new storyline in which a schoolgirl will learn she is pregnant at the age of 12.

The ITV soap is understood to be developing the new plot in which Faye Windass, played by Ellie Leach, 13, falls pregnant, for later this year.

She is expected to become the youngest ever mother on the show, which previously featured Sarah-Louise Platt, played by Tina O'Brien, discovering she was pregnant at the age of 13 in 2000, according to The Sun.

Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, has warned scriptwriters needed to 'take great care' when dealing with such topics.

He said: 'One of the problems of giving prominence in a soap to life experiences that are extremely rare is that it can distort people's perception of reality and give the impression that such experiences are far more common than they really are.

'In spite of the fact that teenage pregnancy rates in the UK are high compared with many other parts of Western Europe, they are still thankfully rare - and pregnancies in 12 year-old girls are much, much rarer still.

'Scriptwriters and production companies need to take great care that in their desperation to attract high viewer ratings they do not normalise behaviour that is both illegal and damaging to impressionable children.'

A Coronation Street source has told The 
Sun: 'This is bound to be a controversial storyline but the programme 
has a history of handling difficult subject matters in a sensitive and 
considerate way.'

The character of Faye Windass was introduced to the show in 2011 as the adopted daughter of Anna Windass.

She was involved in a controversial storyline in 2012 when the soap sparked a storm of protest from viewers with an episode which showed the schoolgirl being smacked.

Hundreds took to web forums and Twitter to express outrage at the scene which featured Faye being hit by her adoptive mother’s boyfriend Owen Armstrong.

The builder, played by Ian Puleston-Davies, loses his temper in the scene after the then ten-year-old schoolgirl deliberately poisons the  fish in his pond.

He is seen whacking Faye on the back of the legs as she winces in pain.

In February MailOnline reported how teenage pregnancy rates had fallen to their lowest levels since the 1960s.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics showed that conceptions among under-18s dropped by 10 per cent in 2012.

Reasons for the sudden decrease in pregnancies include more girls staying in further education and the growing ‘stigma’ of teenage motherhood, officials said.  

In April it was reported a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy were believed to have become Britain's youngest parents after she give birth to a 7lb 4oz baby girl.

At 12 years and three months, she was five months younger than the previous youngest UK mother.

HAYLEY CROPPER'S SUICIDE

The soap prompted a national debate on assisted suicide with the controversial plotline which saw terminally ill character Hayley Cropper (played by Julie Hesmondhalgh) end her life.

The episode attracted an extra two million viewers, prompting accusations the storyline was simply staged to boost ratings.

Before it was even broadcast, the story had sparked much debate on assisted suicide, even though Miss Cropper was shown ending her own life without the help from her husband Roy (pictured below).

The emotional scenes were watched by a peak audience of 10.6million.

Some said ITV had stoked up the controversy in a deliberate attempt to boost its viewing figures, although the broadcaster did not mention assisted suicide in its official press releases.

Despite the criticism, others praised ITV for its sensitive handling of the tragic storyline.

TONY GORDON GUN SIEGE

In June 2010, ITV chiefs were due to show a run of episodes which featured convicted killer Tony Gordon (played by Gary O'Brien) embarking on a terrifying gun siege in Weatherfield after escaping from prison.

During five post-watershed episodes planned for the week, viewers were due to see at least one character die as Tony made it clear he intended to kill his ex-wife Carla (played by Alison King) and Hayley Cropper.

Halfway through the storyline however, on June 2, real-life gunman Derrick Bird killed 12 people and injured 11 others before shooting himself.

As a mark of respect, the programme rescheduled the rest of the episodes.

DEIRDRE RACHID JAILED

In 1998 Free The Weatherfield One became a national phenomenon after Deirdre Rachid (played by Anne Kirkbride) was jailed for mortgage and credit card fraud while her lover Jon Lindsay walked free.

The campaign, led by newspapers, petitioned Home Secretary Jack Straw to become involved on the character's behalf.

Thousands of viewers were left outraged at what was perceived to be a gross miscarriage of justice, and even the Prime Minister Tony Blair joined in, announcing he would order the Home Secretary to investigate.

Deridre (pictured right) was released after three weeks in prison.

SARAH-LOUISE PLATT TEENAGE PREGNANCY

In February 2000, Sarah-Louise Platt (played by Tina O'Brien) discovered she was five months pregnant soon after her 13th birthday.

Her baby daughter Bethany was born four months later.

Despite coming under some criticism that the storyline would glamourise teenage pregnancy, the programme makers were praised by the government for its handling of the subject.
