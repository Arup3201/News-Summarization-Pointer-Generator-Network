NYPD cold case detectives are seeking help from the public to identify the little girl dubbed 'Baby Hope' whose body was found inside a cooler off the Henry Hudson Parkway in 1991.

On Tuesday, the 22nd anniversary of the unsolved crime, police circulated the neighborhood around Dyckman Street in Washington Heights near the wooded area where the child was found, speaking to residents and offering a $12,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.

The discovery by highway workers of a little girl, believed to be between 
three and five years old, tied with rope 
and squeezed into a picnic cooler beneath full cans of Coca-Cola struck a nerve with police and residents alike.

Missing: Police were handing out this poster on Tuesday featuring images relating to the Baby Hope case. The first picture is a current, age-progression sketch of Baby Hope, the second is the sketch released in 1991, and the third photo is of the cooler which the child was found inside

Grisly discovery: The cooler containing Baby Hope was found in Washington Heights, on an embankment off the Henry Hudson Parkway

She had been malnourished and tests showed she had endured sexual abuse and she died of asphyxia. She was naked except for a hair-tie with yellow plastic baubles on it. She had black hair and was white, possibly Hispanic.

The child was badly decomposed, making 
her facial features unrecognizable, and no one came forward to claim 
her. No one had filed a missing persons report and there were very few 
clues.

Even for hardened New York City cops, the case was a sad and grisly one. Detectives named the girl 'Baby Hope', in the hope that someone would come forward and help them find out who she was and what happened to her.

Two years after her discovery, Baby Hope was buried in St Hamond's ceremony. The police of the 34th Precinct pooled their money and paid for her gravestone. She was buried in a white communion dress. 

Years passed, and still no one came forward. In 2007, Baby Hope's body was exhumed to try and extract a DNA sample, but her bones were in such bad condition it was impossible.

A second attempt in 2011, using improved technology yielded a complete DNA profile, and police immediately ran a check on all their convicted felon and missing persons databases but came up empty-handed. 

Changing neighborhood: Washington Heights has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan, but in the '80s and early '90s, when Baby Hope was killed, the area was deeply affected by a crack cocaine epidemic and gang activity

On Tuesday, police made their latest attempt to close the case of Baby Hope.

Police handed out fliers all day, and according to The New York Times, a Police Department Crime Stoppers van drove around the neighborhood equipped with a loud speaker broadcasting a request for help in both English and Spanish. 

'It's hard for me to believe that nobody knows who she is,' Detective Joseph Neenan told The New York Times in 1991. The officer in charge of the case, he was accustomed to searching for missing persons.

'We have the opposite,' he said. 'We have her. We don't know who she is.'

Now, 22 years later, Detective Robert Dewhurst echoes him:

'I feel somebody knows who this girl was,' he told the New York Daily News.

Perhaps Baby Hope 'had little girlfriends that are grown now and know something wasn’t right on the block when she was gone.'

'Everything about this case is already out there,' Sergeant Carlos Nieves, a police spokesman, told The New York Times. “They’re hoping that somebody who hasn’t come out sees this.'

At the time of Baby Hope's death in 1991, Washington Heights was in the thrall of a crack cocaine epidemic and the area was known for gangs and violence. Now, it has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan and families with young children walk the streets with impunity.

There are a lot of new faces, but police are optimistic that some of the older members of the community remember the case of Baby Hope.
