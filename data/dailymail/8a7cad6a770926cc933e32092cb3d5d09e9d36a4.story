Recovered: Constance Murray (pictured with her husband, Christopher) was found in a park near her Northeast Philadelphia home on Tuesday morning after failing to return from her evening jog

Police confirmed on Wednesday that the 46-year-old married mother-of-two found dead in a Philadelphia cemetery on Tuesday morning was strangled to death.

Autopsy results released in the afternoon revealed that Constance Murray was murdered while jogging in Pennypack Park, however she was not sexually assaulted and evidence shows only a minor struggle took place.

This indicates an overwhelming and sudden attack after she left her home at 9pm on Monday on her usual jogging route, but nonetheless has left police confused by the bizarre circumstances.

Police also revealed that the smartphone and headphones that Murray was wearing when she was attacked have not been recovered.

Her husband Christopher and daughters Elizabeth and Emily have not made a statement but Philadelphia homicide Captain James Clark confirmed that police have no current leads in the case.

Clark told The Philadelphia Daily News that Murray's husband went out to look for his wife at midnight after she failed to return from her usual jog through the park.

When he did not find her on the route or at home he filed a missing-person report with the police at around 2am.

Then, at around 6am, a member of the public walking in Pennypack Park found the body of Murray and emergency workers pronounced her dead at the scene.

Reporters noted a large gathering of friends and family - including her two young daughters - outside the Murray home on Wednesday and witnessed a series grief-stricken hugs.

Local residents have been left stunned in the leafy, suburban community.

'I’m back here all the time, I know this area really well and it’s just really sad that something like this happened here,' said Paul Schlear to CBS 3.

'Someone very sick and deranged had to do something like that. I just hope they catch them.'

Detective Clark said that women especially should take extra care if they are out jogging in the northeast of the city.

'People should use extra caution. Women out there walking or jogging should have someone else with them for protection, just until we find out what went on,' said Clark to CBS 3.

Across Murray's Facebook page her friends wrote messages of sympathy to her family and neighbors said her death is a worrying tragedy.

'It’s really close to home. We are raising our kids here, you know, so it’s just a little bit frightening,' said neighbor Jessica Nigro to CBS 3.

Nadine Meehan, a friend of Murray's, told NBC10 the victim was an active member of the Winchester Swim Club.

'She
 always was a really nice person,' said Meehan. 'She always had a smile 
on her face. I'm shocked. She was just a regular mom.'
