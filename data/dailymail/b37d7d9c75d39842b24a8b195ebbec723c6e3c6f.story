The UK's largest sand drawing - an image of a Land Rover Defender measuring 1km long - has been created in the same location its inventor sketched the car's unmistakable shape almost 70 years ago.

This year, Jaguar Land Rover is set to stop building the model - a favourite of the royal family - and in recognition of the end of an era, six classic defenders were used to draw the car in the sand in Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey.

This is where Maurice Wilks - the man behind the original Land Rover - imagined the iconic design.

Land Rover: The UK's largest sand drawing - an image of a a Defender measuring 1km long - has been created using six of the vehicles

Discontinued: Jaguar Land Rover will stop building the Defender in the UK this year and the artwork commemorated its history

Defenders: Each car towed a 12ft agricultural harrow to create the drawing in the sand in Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey

'Massive': 'If you don't do everything quickly enough, the sea comes in and you basically don't have an image and then it's game over. This is unique in that it's massive and it's using these wonderful machines to make it,' said sand artist Jamie Wardley

Each car - a Land Rover Series I, II and III, a Ninety from the Eighties, a Defender 90 Hard Top and a Defender 110 Station Wagon - towed an 12ft agricultural harrow to create the drawing,

They helped to draw the continuous 4.52km line over about three hours, but the artwork only remained in place for a matter of minutes before it was washed away by the incoming tide.

Stephen Wilks, son of Maurice, said: 'We used to come here for our holiday periods. 

'My father met his brother on the beach and was explaining the concept of a new idea for a go anywhere, do anything vehicle.

'He made a drawing in the sand of an outline of how he thought the Land Rover could be made. 

'That was the start of it all, the conception of Land Rover.'

The Wilks family owned land on the Welsh island and Maurice wanted a versatile vehicle that could double as a light tractor and off-roader.

Future: Land Rover is set to cease production of the Defender at the end of the year, but this week a spokesman for the firm said it is 'investigating the possibility of maintaining production of the current Defender at an overseas production facility'

UK manufacturing: The last of the current Land Rover Defenders will roll-off the production lines of Jaguar Land Rover’s Solihull factory in the West Midlands in December

4x4: The Wilks family owned land on the Welsh island and Maurice wanted a versatile vehicle that could double as a light tractor and off-roader

Washed away: The image, which took around three hours to create, lasted just minutes before the tide came in

Post war: The popular 4x4 vehicle, which is exported all around the world, represents the continuation of the very first Land Rover which came on to the scene in April 1948 and was modelled on the war-time jeeps

Special editions: Land Rover launched a year of celebrations with three run-out special limited edition versions of the Defender - called Heritage, Adventure and Autobiography

His design was christened the 'Land Rover', the outline of which is now recognised as the Defender. The first car rolled off the production line 68 years ago.

Sand artist, Jamie Wardley said: 'If you don't do everything quickly enough, the sea comes in and you basically don't have an image and then it's game over. 

'This is unique in that it's massive and it's using these wonderful machines to make it.'

Land Rover is set to cease production of the Defender at the end of the year, a decision which has been criticised by purists and fans of the marque.

This week, however, a Land Rover spokesman said: 'Land Rover is investigating the possibility of maintaining production of the current Defender at an overseas production facility, after the close of UK manufacturing. 

'Any continuation would see low volume production maintained for sale outside the EU.’  

The announcement came as the firm launched a year of celebrations with three run-out special limited edition versions of the Defender - called Heritage, Adventure and Autobiography 

Popular: The Land Rover Defender has featured in the last James Bond movie, Skyfall, and the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider

Invented: Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey is where Maurice Wilks - the man behind the original Land Rover - imagined the iconic design

Christened: Maurice Wilks' design was called the 'Land Rover', the outline of which is now recognised as the Defender

Royalty: The Defender is a favourite of the royal family and has featured in blockbuster movies

Six classic defenders were used to draw the car in the sand in Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey.

Each car towed a 12ft agricultural harrow to turn the sand over.

The image was made with one continuous 4.52km line and the help of sand artist, Jamie Wardley.

Nick Rogers, Land Rover vehicle line director, said: 'With a history stretching back 68 years, this is a Land Rover that has thrived for decades on its unquestionable capability and iconic shape. 

'I now have the honour of being one of the many enthusiasts at Land Rover committed to creating a fitting successor to the legendary Defender.' 

The last of the current Land Rover Defenders will roll-off the production lines of Jaguar Land Rover’s Solihull factory in the West Midlands in December.

The popular 4x4 vehicle, which is exported all around the world, represents the continuation of the very first Land Rover which came on to the scene in April 1948 and was modelled on the war-time jeeps. 

It featured in the last James Bond movie, Skyfall, and the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.
