A former public schoolboy who has joined the fight against ISIS today insisted he would never be captured alive and vowed: 'I’ve got a grenade in my pocket and I’ll take them with me'.

A former Young Conservative, the man gave up a top job in the City in December to volunteer with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Iraq and Syria.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline from Iraq, he attacked David Cameron for failing to tackle extremism and called on him to 'do the right thing' by offering more support in the war.

The man, who went to a £23,000-a-year public school but is operating under the 'nom de guerre' of Macer Gifford , also vowed to stay on the front line until the terror group has been crushed.

The 28-year-old, who once stood as a Tory councillor, said: 'I passionately believe in democracy and freedom of speech – all the rights we take for granted in the UK.

'I have left my family and a comfortable life in Britain to risk suffering the most horrific death at the hands of ISIS. 

'But they won’t take me alive. I’ve got a grenade in my pocket and I’ll blow myself up and take them with me. I won’t let my family see me publicly executed.'

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline from Iraq, the man attacked David Cameron for failing to tackle extremism and called on him to 'do the right thing' by giving more support to the Kurdish forces

The man left for Syria two weeks before Christmas after telling his parents he going to Istanbul for a low-paid job with the Kurds.

‘I was about to start work at a major bank, but the idea of coming out here and helping the Kurds meant much more to me.

‘I want to help the Kurdish people. I want to shine a light on their plight here.

‘It was the Kurdish people who took the fight to ISIS and now have the chance to build their own country.'

But he said the Kurdish people were being let down by a failure to act in the West, notably from Britain.

He told MailOnline: 'The British government hasn’t done enough.

‘If David Cameron was in the room with me now, I would say that he must stick to the core values of the Conservative Party, which is liberty and justice.

‘I’d tell him not to play politics with this and take a stance on principle.

'If the British government were to help more – even just with non-lethal equipment like night-vision goggles and trainers – the Kurds would win this war much more quickly.'

His comments come a day after MPs blasted Britain's ‘tiny’ role in the global fight against Islamic State terrorists.

Just days after the sickening video of a Jordanian pilot being burnt alive emerged, the Defence Select Committee attacked Britain’s contribution as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘deeply concerning’.

The UK has so far carried out only 6 per cent of the air strikes against Islamist jihadists – amounting to less than one a day, the committee’s report will reveal.

And there were only three UK military personnel outside the Kurdish regions of Iraq, compared with 400 Australians, 280 Italians and 300 Spanish, when the MPs visited Iraq before Christmas.

Since arriving in the Middle East, he has been trained up by the YPG in the mountains.

He has also been helping to move weapons across the border and train other would-be fighters as they bolster resistance in the region.

He is one of a just a handful of British fighters who are known to have joined the Kurds.

Two others - ex-solders James Hughes from Worcestershire, and Jamie Read, from Lanarkshire - were both out fighting last year, but returned home over fears for their family's safety.

Left a comfortable life: The man went to a £23k-a-year boarding school before studying politics at university

His new life is a far cry from the one he left behind. 

He grew up in a quaint village in the East Midlands with his mother, a retired fitness instructor, his photographer father and two brothers.

He went to a £23,000-a-year boarding school before studying politics at university.

During his studies, he also found time to become one of the youngest people to run for public office when he stood in council elections in 2006. He also worked for a Tory MP.  

After he graduated, he would go on to begin a career in finance - like so many others from his background.

But he always had a desire to not be pinned down to an office job.

His father told MailOnline: 'He's always off on one escapade or another, we never know what he's doing.

'It's not done my health or my wife's health much good over the years.'

During his second year at university, he went to Zimbabwe to work with human rights lawyer David Colthard, who was then the shadow Minster for Education of the opposition party.

He was intrigued by Mr Colthard's role in Zimbabwe's opposition.

He then went to work for a marine security company defending boats from pirates in the horn of Africa.

But he was based in a London office and it seems he got itchy feet.

His next adventure was in a country which is ranked the eighth most dangerous in the world, the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This time, he was sponsored by the charity PAP-DRC to go into the Ituri Forest, in the east of the country, to find and map the pygmy villages.

He was also there to help them, as the pygmys are thought of as second class citizens in the central African country.

Exactly how dangerous a country he had travelled into was about to become all too clear when he found himself held at gunpoint by a group  army deserters.

The deserters said they were 'killing monkeys' - but his charm got them out of the situation.

He is also fighting alongside the Kurdish Women's Protection Unit in Syria and Iraq

But the experience certainly didn't dissuade him from either his love of adventure or his desire to help those less fortunate.

He toured Ethiopia and Somaliland for several months in between lucrative jobs in currency trading.

So when, two weeks before Christmas, he told his parents he was off to Istanbul to take a low-paid job helping the Kurds, they didn't think twice.

'He's always been interested in politics, right from day one. He's very, very passionate. He always wants to help people,' said his mother.

However, he didn't reveal his end destination to his parents - who only discovered where their son was later.

'He went to Istanbul and changed planes and went to Northern Iraq,' his father revealed.

'From there he went overland to the Kurdish area of Turkey and now he is between Syria and Turkey.' 

MailOnline has chosen to use alternative names and leave out some details at the man's request over fears for his family's safety.
