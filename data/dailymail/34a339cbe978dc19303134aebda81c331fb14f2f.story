Elisabeth Hasselbeck returned to Fox & Friends after a month-long absence on Friday and revealed she had undergone surgery to remove a tumor from her abdomen.

The anchor and former View host said she had a 'scary week' as she waited nervously to see if the tumor was cancerous, but revealed that doctors have given her a clean bill of health.

The 37-year-old host and married mother-of-three has been away from the show for a month after undergoing surgery on October 15. The network had not revealed the reason for her absence.

On Friday, as she gripped the hand of co-host Steve Doocy, Hasselbeck became emotional as she said doctors found the tumor last month and instructed her to undergo surgery immediately, saying they didn't like how it looked.

Fears: Gripping the hand of co-host Steve Doocy as Eric Bolling looked on, she said that she waited for an agonizing week to find out whether the tumor was cancerous, but thankfully it was not

After the operation, Hasselbeck said she had an agonizing week waiting to find out whether it was cancerous.

'We had real serious talks at home and honest ones with the kids,' she told viewers at the start of the show on Friday.

But thankfully there is no sign of cancer, she said, although she admitted she had prepared herself for the worst.

'So many people I know have stared down the barrel of that cancer gun, and looked at it when they have gotten bad news... and done remarkable things, courageously to fight it,' she said.

'So I knew if I got that kind of news I would be in their wings and, by their example, able to fight it. I didn't get that message from my doctors. I got a clear and clean bill of health and I'm thankful. '

She also said she was thankful for the support from her family, friends, producers, viewers and Fox News CEO, Roger Ailes.

'I could not be more thankful for my family and my friends who've stuck by me with incredible support,' she said. 'This entire Fox family treated me like family the entire way.

'I'm certainly not a person who takes a lot for granted, but I certainly don't take it for granted now.'
