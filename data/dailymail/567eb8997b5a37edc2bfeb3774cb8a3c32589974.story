Homesick sailors made an emotional return home today after eight months on the ocean - with fathers finally getting to settle down with babies born while they were away.

The crew of the Royal Navy mine hunter were given a hero’s welcome by family and friends as they returned from a mission in the Middle East.

Children held signs which said 'Welcome Home Daddy' while other loved ones carried balloons and gifts as the crew of HMS Pembroke disembarked at HM Naval Base Clyde, in Faslane, Argyll, this morning.

Meanwhile, HMS Middleton floated home into Portsmouth as it was framed by a glorious rainbow casting its colours across the dock.

It was an extra special moment for CO Steve Higham who met his nine-week old daughter Georgiana for the first time.

She was born while the crew were on an eight month trip around Bahrain. Different crews have manned the 52-metre long ship during its three-year operation in the Arabian Gulf, ensuring safe passage for merchant and civilian vessels.

For many more of the sailors, the return was the first time they had seen their families for months.

Deputy marine engineer chief petty officer Mike Jack, 35, from Largoward, Fife, was deployed to the Gulf just six weeks after his daughter Eilidh, now nine months old, was born.

'She was six weeks old when I left, so I was just feeding her her first bottle the night before we went away,' he said.

'It was really hard. It’s the first time I’ve had to do it - to go away and leave a little one. She’s huge now.

'We just need to hand the ship over and we’ll be off on leave.

'I can’t wait, I’ve got nine weeks off so she’ll get used to me hopefully by then.'

Mr Jack was also welcomed home by his wife Alison, 38, stepson Jack, 10, and nine-year-old daughter Holly, who said she was 'very excited' to have her 'daddy back'.

Leading Engineer Technician Andrew Lee, 34, from Larkhall, Lanarkshire, stepped on the dock to be reunited with his new fiancee, Elaine Bolton, 29.

The pair got engaged when Ms Bolton flew over to Dubai halfway through LET Lee’s deployment.

He said: 'I asked her at Dubai Creek when we were sitting on a wooden dhow.

'I’m back in tomorrow and Sunday to complete the handover of the ship, but hopefully after that we’ll plan an engagement party.'

Ms Bolton, a call centre worker, said: 'It’s great to have him home again.

'We’re hoping to plan the wedding for April 2014 but I was warned not to book anything until he got home.

'It was good getting engaged over there but it was hard leaving him.

'I’ve found it hard over the past couple of months because folk have been congratulating me and I feel like my other half is missing.

HMS Pembroke, which left the Clyde in October 2009, also supported forces from the US, France and Oman, and took part in training exercises with them.

After leaving Bahrain five weeks ago, the ship was making its 7,000-mile journey home when it was deployed again on July 27 to help guard a merchant vessel from the threat of piracy in the Gulf of Aden.

The ship, Delhi Express, suffered an engine failure between Somalia and Yemen, an area where pirates are known to operate, and put out a call for help.

HMS Pembroke and sister ship HMS Middleton readied their weapons and guarded the vessel until it got moving again.

HMS Middleton, which rotated its 40-strong crew every six or eight months, operated out of Bahrain conducting counter-piracy and security patrols as well as exercises with coalition forces.

Friends and families welcomed the warship back as it arrived at Portsmouth Naval Base, Hampshire.

While returning to the UK, Middleton 
visited Valletta in Malta for the 70th anniversary commemoration of 
Operation Pedestal, the crucial stage of the Malta Convoys' mission 
during the Second World War.
The event was marked by a visit to the ship from First Sea Lord Admiral 
Sir Mark Stanhope, the prime minister of Malta and several surviving 
heroes of the campaign.

Middleton's commanding officer Lieutenant Commander Steve Higham said: 'My team have had the honour of serving in Middleton for over eight 
months during which we have conducted missions across the military 
spectrum.

'We have trained hard with other navies and proven the Royal Navy's 
ability to find and destroy sea mines in the most challenging of 
conditions.

'Throughout, HMS Middleton's ship's company have conducted themselves with fortitude and determination.

'Acting as ambassadors for Britain, they have been a credit to their country and the Royal Navy.

'The separation has been hard, the distances great, but the 
encouragement and support of families has been key to our success and I 
know everyone is looking forward to a few weeks of thoroughly 
well-deserved leave.'

Lieutenant Commander Chris Allan, 
commanding officer of HMS Pembroke, said: 'It was just a single incident
in a packed deployment, but a memorable one.

'I
think what it shows is the flexibility of the minehunting community and
why the Royal Navy is as valuable today as it ever was.

'Over
90 per cent of the world’s trade is carried by sea and the UK 
transports nearly all of its oil and gas and half of its food by ship.

'Mine countermeasures vessels contribute to keeping the sea lanes, both at home and abroad, clear and safe.'

Lt Cmdr Allan, 38, who is originally from Wishaw, Lanarkshire, but now lives in Portsmouth, Hampshire, said he was looking forward to spending some time with his wife during his leave from the ship.
