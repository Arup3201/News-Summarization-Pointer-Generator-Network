Rain in Manchester appeared to come as a shock at Old Trafford on Friday when a stretch of outfield that could not cope with an hour’s downpour forced the abandonment of the second day with England starting to pull away from India.

Lancashire faced anger from spectators who had seen the drainage system which enabled the bulk of the playing surface to recover from a heavy shower fail in one ugly, relaid area of the outfield that remained stubbornly unfit for play.

It is an embarrassment for Lancashire, who prepared the best pitch of this series only to see the elements expose the inadequacies of the Old Trafford facilities and hold up England’s attempt to move into a winning position.

Rain which stopped play 35 minutes after lunch had cleared seemingly in time for two more hours of play but umpires Marais Erasmus and Rod Tucker were unhappy with a saturated area at the Statham End.

It emerged that construction work earlier this year had caused turf to be relaid in front of the media centre in April and it had not bedded down in time for this Test. Cue a scarred area of sandy turf, a frustrated crowd, a black mark for Lancashire in highly competitive times for Test match grounds and red faces to match the Red Rose.

It was left to Mike Watkinson, the lugubrious Lancashire director of cricket, to offer the case for the defence of an Old Trafford ground that suffered a similar controversy during a Twenty20 game against Australia five years ago.

‘We’ve had a massive downpour and this is an area used for construction purposes,’ he said. ‘It’s got high-performing drains but what it hasn’t got is turf knitted together over the years like the rest of the outfield. If we’ve got anything wrong it was to go with the waterhog instead of letting it drain naturally. It looks a bit of a mess, we accept that.

‘You hope people look at the cricket that’s been played and the quality of the pitch rather than five metres of a sandy puddle that affected an hour’s cricket.’

That may be so, but with terrible weather forecast for Sunday, the drainage and outfield will be tested to the full and the time already lost could prove significant in what has become an absorbing fourth Test. 

There seemed no way back for India from eight for four after just half an hour on Thursday but on Friday they ensured that England face a fight if they are going to emerge from Old Trafford with at least a share of this series guaranteed.

Only when Joe Root and Jos Buttler began to take advantage of some curious tactics by MS Dhoni after lunch did England look likely to build the decisive first-innings lead that had looked assured when their bowlers ran riot on day one.

Clearly the fall of Gary Ballance in the last over of the first day had lifted India and they stayed in contention on Friday, albeit without gaining the swing enjoyed by Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, until that heavy rain arrived.

Chris Jordan, who took just one wicket in the Indian innings, had been handed the perfect chance to prove his batting worth as nightwatchman and signalled his intent by hooking Pankaj Singh aggressively for four.

Jordan managed two more boundaries, even though one of them was inside-edged narrowly past his stumps, until he middled another pull from Bhuvneshwar Kumar and was athletically caught by a diving Varun Aaron at mid-wicket.

Ian Bell then moved to his 42nd Test half-century before he was undone by the skill of Kumar. First Bell’s outside edge was defeated and Kumar then took the same edge with the next ball with Bell expecting an inswinger.

Moeen Ali (right) looked to take on the short ball, pulling Kumar for successive fours that gave England the lead, but the ball after he had uncertainly steered Aaron for two he was stuck on the back foot and bowled by a prodigious inswinger.

Enter Buttler in vastly different circumstances from those which marked his debut, but he again showed his vast potential by knuckling down with Root in an unbeaten partnership of 67 that was beginning to flourish before the rain. The pair were helped by some odd tactics by Dhoni which included bowling Ravindra Jadeja both just before and after lunch when conditions were crying out for a burst from his seamers.

It enabled England to move into a lead of 85 that could prove decisive — if the drainage system allows play to resume on Saturday.

GOLD TRAFFORD

Ian Bell’s belligerent 58 continued his love affair with Old Trafford, where he has made 608 Test runs at an average of 76. Among batsmen who have played a minimum of six Test innings here, only Allan Border (416 runs at 83) and Denis Compton (818 at 81) average more.

SINGH'S LONG WAIT

India seamer Pankaj Singh has now conceded 258 runs without taking a Test wicket, sending down 384 balls in the process. But he has some way to go before he breaks the record of India’s Amritsar Kripal Singh, who waited 651 deliveries for his first Test wicket.
