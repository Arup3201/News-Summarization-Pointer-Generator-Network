A broken heart, a gun and a bite mark will finally prove a former LAPD detective killed a love rival almost three decades ago in a fit of rage after the woman married her ex-boyfriend, a court heard.

Stephanie Lazarus, 51, of Los Angeles, allegedly beat and shot dead Sherri Rasmussen, 29, in February 1986 after her lover John Reutten wed the hospital nursing director instead of her.

Shocking close-up death pictures of the battered face of Mrs Rasmussen were presented to jurors in the trial of Lazarus on Monday, showing one eye swollen shut and the other wide open.

Mrs Rasmussen's mouth was open wide, her hands held up as if in a defensive posture. Prosecutors suggested the mayhem was inflicted by Lazarus after her lover married this woman instead of her.

‘Sherri Rasmussen was wearing the gown that Stephanie Lazarus believed was hers,’ Deputy District Attorney Shannon Presby said on Monday in his opening statement to jurors in a Los Angeles court.

But a lawyer for the one-time top cop said she is being wrongly accused in a case so old some of the witnesses can’t remember it. And he said much of the DNA evidence has deteriorated over time.

Retired LAPD cop Rodney Forrest testified about going to Mrs Rasmussen's home after the killing.

But after he gave details including a description of her distraught husband, defence lawyer Mark Overland asked if Mr Forrest had told prosecutors last year that he remembers nothing of the case.

‘Yes,’ said Mr Forrest, who acknowledged asking to see his notes from 1986. ‘Did you remember then?’ asked Mr Overland. ‘I remembered what was on the report and a few other things,’ he said.

Mr Presby told jurors she understood memories have faded. Ronald Reagan was President when Mrs Rasmussen was found beaten and shot to death. DNA analysis had not yet been discovered.

Lawyers outlined their cases, portraying her as either a heartbroken, jilted lover driven to kill her romantic rival or an innocent woman snared in a web of mishandled scientific evidence.

In the courtroom audience sat Mrs Rasmussen's relatives including parents and her sister, Teresa Lane, who testified about the relationship between Mrs Rasmussen and Mr Ruetten.

‘They were walking holding hands like a happy couple,’ she said of a visit the day before the death.

Rasmussen family lawyer John Taylor said outside court that the dead woman’s relatives would be there every day even though it’s ‘tough’ for them to view the evidence.

‘It took 26 years to get here finally,’ Mr Taylor said. ‘The family is pleased to get the trial going.’ Both sides said the proof of the cold case would be in the forensic evidence.

‘A bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart,’ Mr Presby declared in the crowded courtroom. ‘That's the evidence that will prove the defendant Stephanie Lazarus murdered Sherri Rasmussen.’

He said a bite on Mrs Rasmussen's arm contained saliva that was matched to Lazarus's DNA more than two decades after the killing.

But Lazarus's lawyer Mr Overland said the DNA was corrupted over the decades, and a forensic dentist would testify that the bite mark does not match an impression taken of Lazarus's teeth.

Mr Presby acknowledged the gun used in the killing wasn't found but said the bullets came from the same type of weapon that was sold to Lazarus at the LAPD gun shop when she became an officer.

Mr Overland suggested police were correct when they initially suspected she was killed by burglars.

Mr Presby told a story of Lazarus being obsessed with Mr Ruetten, who did not return her feelings. When Mr Ruetten told her he was marrying another woman, he said she was driven to vengeance.

He said she broke into the townhouse that Mr Ruetten shared with Mrs Rasmussen, his new wife, then bludgeoned and shot her to death after a confrontation that left blood on the walls.

Mr Presby read part of a letter Lazarus wrote to her mother beforehand. ‘I'm totally in love with John and the past year has really torn me up,’ it said. ‘I don't think I'll ever understand his decision.’

Mr Overland said the relationship between Lazarus and Mrs Ruetten was not one-sided. They were college friends who later became lovers, and their sexual relationship lasted about a year.

She became close to his family and thought they had a future. But he chose Mrs Rasmussen and a short time before the wedding, Lazarus appealed to Mr Ruetten to meet with her, Mr Overland said.

He came to her home and the meeting ended with them having sex, the lawyer said, adding: ‘He told Stephanie Lazarus he was moving on with his life.’ Lazarus has been in custody since 2009.
