An ex-police officer who killed his former daughter-in-law and another woman at a Delaware courthouse before committing suicide had his wife and son help him in the murder plot, according to a newly released affidavit.

Monday's killings were the culmination of a bitter, years-long custody battle involving the slain woman, Christine Belford, and the gunman's son.

Texas authorities said in the affidavit that the shooter, Thomas Matusiewicz, his wife and his son were all suspected of ‘intentionally and knowingly participating in a murder.’

Gunman: Thomas Matusiewicz, who allegedly fatally shot his former daughter-in-law and her friend in Wilmington, Del., plays with his granddaughters

Matusiewicz had previously complained that his family wasn't getting justice in a lawsuit Miss Belford filed against them over the kidnapping of the pair's three daughters.

Matusiewicz complained in an August 2011 letter to a Delaware judge that he and his family had no money to defend themselves in the lawsuit Christine Belford filed as her ex-husband, David Matusiewicz, awaited sentencing for taking the girls to Central America.

Family plot: An affidavit has revealed that Matusiewicz allegedly carried out the courthouse slayings with the help of his wife and son

‘We've lost or spent over a million dollars trying to get our grand-daughters to safety and now THERE IS NO MONEY LEFT AND THEY ARE STILL IN CUSTODY OF THEIR MOTHER (who has been in the care of someone in the mental health profession for over 20 years)!,’ Thomas and his wife, Lenore Matusiewicz, wrote in boldface letters.

‘Is it true as they say, you only get the amount of justice you can afford?’ they added. ‘Well, I guess we aren't going to be getting any.’

Delaware State Police said Mr Matusiewicz, 68, walked into the lobby of the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington on Monday and shot and killed Belford, 39, and her friend Laura Mulford, 47, before taking his own life.

According to an affidavit filed by Texas authorities to search Thomas Matusiewicz's home in Edcouch, Texas, he was carrying handwritten death certificates for Belford and Timothy Hitchings, an attorney representing her in the divorce and custody battle, when he entered the Delaware courthouse.

Law enforcement officials in Texas found eight guns found inside the Matusiewicz home and in a recreational vehicle on the property, and five more guns at a storage unit in Donna, Texas.

Investigators said record checks on all the weapons came back clear. Thomas Matusiewicz once worked as a police officer in Vineland, New Jersey.

Authorities also seized several boxes and jars of ammunition, letters, court documents, Veterans Affairs documents for Thomas Matusiewicz, who served in the Navy, and a book entitled ‘Kill All the Lawyers.’

Hitchings said in an email that he had no firsthand information about being targeted.

‘It's still being investigated,’ he said. ‘I will say that Thomas Matusiewicz likely resented my representing Christine.’

Murdered: Christine Belford, center, was killed when her ex-husband's father opened fire in a Wilmington, Delaware, courthouse. Her ex-husband abducted the couple's three daughters in 2007

Tragedy: Matusiewicz opened fire in the lobby of the courthouse, before he had to pass through metal detectors. He shot four people, two of them fatally

Victims: Laura Elizabeth 'Beth' Mulford (right) had accompanied her friend Belford (left) to court for a child support hearing. Both women were shot dead by the father of Belford's ex-husband

Neither David Matusiewicz nor his 
mother has been arrested in connection with the shooting, but David 
Matusiewicz is being detained by federal authorities who say he has 
violated the terms of his probation.

Authorities
allege in court documents that he failed to disclose that he spent the 
night before the shooting at a home in Elkton, Maryland, and that he has
not paid restitution and child support as ordered.

The
Delaware shooting was the culmination of years of acrimony in a bitter 
divorce and custody battle. At the heart of the dispute were the 
daughters of Belford and David Matusiewicz, now ages 7, 9 and 10.

David
Matusiewicz pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal fraud and kidnapping 
charges after fleeing to Nicaragua in a motor home with his mother and 
the three girls.

David 
Matusiewicz, who was released from prison last year, kidnapped the girls
after telling Belford they were going to Disney World for two weeks.

The 2007 kidnapping of 
Matusiewicz's daughters became national news and was featured on programs like 
'America's Most Wanted.'

The
two were divorced and sharing custody at the time. Prosecutors say he 
forged his wife's signature to obtain nearly $250,000 from a Delaware 
bank, then sent the money to his parents' bank account and had his 
father transfer the money to a Bank of New Zealand account.

Belford
sued her former husband, his parents and Gonzalez in 2009, claiming 
they worked together to carry out the kidnapping. She sought 
compensation for ‘medical, therapeutic, counseling, travel and other 
expenses.’

Miss Belford dropped the lawsuit in December 2011 after Thomas and Lenore Matusiewicz filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas.

‘It
became obvious that it was not going to be collectable,’ said Belford's
attorney, James Woods. ‘I had no doubt she would win, and probably a 
very significant amount of money, for that torture they put her 
through.’

Woods said that 
after Belford dropped the lawsuit, Thomas Matusiewicz sent him two thick
packages of documents containing ‘all kinds of scandalous and 
ridiculous allegations’ that Christine was abusing the children and was 
an unfit mother. The allegations were never substantiated, Belford was 
never charged and she was given full custody of the girls.

Released: The dead woman's husband was David T. Matusiewicz, who served four years in federal prison and was released in April

‘It was obvious that there was so much venom they had directed toward Christine that it was almost palpable,’ Woods said.

Lenore
Matusiewicz made similar allegations in a handwritten letter she 
addressed to Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden in January 2011.

She
was on probation at the time after serving more than a year in Delaware
state prison for endangering the welfare of her three granddaughters 
related to the kidnapping.

She said her son was ‘paying the price for trying to protect his children....’

A
federal judge who sentenced David Matusiewicz to prison noted that he 
never expressed any concern that his ex-wife was abusing their children 
until after he had been arrested.

A
state judge who denied a motion by Lenore Matusiewicz to modify her 
prison sentence in 2010 also expressed skepticism about the abuse 
claims.

‘Sadly, even if all 
the allegations of the defendant and her son are true, their decisions 
only seemed to harm the children more,’ the judge wrote.

The bitter family feud had come to ahead on Monday while Belford and her friend Laura Elizabeth 'Beth' Mulford were at the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, for a child support hearing against Ms Belford's ex-husband, David Matusiewcz, a once promising optometrist.

David Matusiewicz was in the lobby of the courthouse when his father opened fire with a .45-caliber pistol and shot dead Ms Belford and Ms Mulford. Thomas Matusiewicz also shot two Capitol police guards in the chest before he was killed in an exchange of fire with the officers.

The officers were saved by their bulletproof vests and sustained only minor injuries.

Ms Belford's neighbors say she was terrified of her ex-husband's family.

They say she installed cameras and a security system at her house and took other steps to protect her children.

Deployed: Heavily-armed SWAT officers fanned out around the courthouse to ensure there were no other shooters

Secured: The New Castle County Courthouse has rows of metal detectors and up to ten security guards. However, the gunmen opened fire in a lobby while people were waiting to pass through security

'She had all the windows changed with
special locks. She had cameras around the house. She had two huge dogs.
She didn’t know whether she should get a gun. Her house is like Fort 
Knox, so I thought she was safe,' neighbor Lois Dawson told the 
News-Journal.

Witnesses said Thomas Matusiewicz's 
rampage had deadly efficiency. He stepped off the elevated leading from 
the parking garage to the lobby of the courthouse and immediately pulled
out a pistol and opened fire on Ms Belford and Ms Mulford.

He then fired on two officers who were guarding the entrance to the courthouse.

The shooting occurred about 8.10am in
the lobby, where up to 60 people had lined up to pass through metal 
detectors to enter the main part of the building.
