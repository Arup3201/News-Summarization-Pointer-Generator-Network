Bath are trying to sign Taulupe Faletau after the World Cup to continue the exodus of leading Wales players to the Aviva Premiership.

The 24-year-old Lions No 8 has another full season to run on his current contract with the Newport Gwent Dragons, who have this week indicated that they are 'extremely keen' to retain his services. 

However, Sportsmail understands that the Tongan-born player is increasingly likely to agree a move to The Rec in the autumn, which would require Bath to pay a transfer fee.

Bath had been linked with Springboks No 8 Duane Vermeulen, but he is set for a big-money move to Toulon 

Faletau has been noticeably absent from the list of Wales stars recently signing up for national dual contracts with the Welsh Rugby Union and the regions.

Bath have been linked with him in the past but after rumours of a deal in 2013, he committed to another three years at Rodney Parade. Now though, several sources have revealed that the West Country club are closing in.

Armed with financial backing from owner Bruce Craig, Bath have become major players in the upper levels of the transfer market.

England backrower Ben Morgan was also on Bath's radar before he signed a new deal with Gloucester 

They tried to lure South Africa No 8 Duane Vermeulen but it is thought his wage demands were too high and he has opted to move to Toulon instead.

Ben Morgan was also on the radar, but he agreed a new deal at Gloucester. If Faletau joins Bath, he will join a growing band of Wales exiles in the Premiership, including George North at Northampton, Richard Hibbard and James Hook at Gloucester, Rhys Priestland who is heading to Bath, and Jamie Roberts who is bound for Harlequins.

While Wales coach Warren Gatland has made official his stance against selecting players who move out of the country, he has 'wild card' exemptions and Faletau is certain to fall into that category.
