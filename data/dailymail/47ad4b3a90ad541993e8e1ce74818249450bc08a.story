A young man whose family convenience store had been a target
for criminals since it opened gunned down a robber this weekend when the man
threatened his sister.

Usman Seth, 20, of Houston, said the night had been
uneventful before the gunman burst in around 10pm Friday.

The robber had a shotgun, and threatened Seth's sister at
the cash register.

Usman Seth, 20, of Houston, said he opened fire on the robber to protect his family

The gunman was later identified as a young Hispanic man who had been in the store 30 minutes earlier

Usman Seth's father - who also bears the name Usman - started the convenience store three years ago and robbers have been a persistent problem

'I wanted to make the threat go away,' Seth told the Houston
Chronicle.

He says his father handed him a 9mm Smith & Wesson
handgun and he opened fire.

'My family - their lives - were in my hands,' he said. 'I
had to protect them.'

He managed to hit the robber in the man's leg, but the
masked man returned fire.

'He kept threatening us,' Seth told reporters.

As the gunfight continued, the robber positioned himself
beside a Dr. Pepper cooler.

Finally Seth was able to hit him again, eventually killing
the man.

Seth said he recognized the man's face when first responders
arrived and removed the man's mask.

He was a young Hispanic who had come into the store about 30
minutes earlier.

The robber's name has not been released.

However, Seth said the man's brother came to the store
Saturday morning and threatened to take revenge by murdering the family.

Seth's father, also named Usman Seth, 59, said he worries
the family will have peace after this.

'We are continuously getting threats from them,' he said.

A grand jury is expected to review the case.

The Seth family opened the store three years ago after
moving from New York.
