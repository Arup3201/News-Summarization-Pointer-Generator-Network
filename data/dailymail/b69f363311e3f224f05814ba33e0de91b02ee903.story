A new video shows the terrifying moment a film crew rushed to save the life of Oscar-winner William Hurt.

The crew of the Gregg Allman biopic Midnight Rider can be seen dashing to get him off the tracks of a railroad bridge, along with their equipment, as he lay across the railway filming a scene in Georgia while a train rushes towards him and the crew at breakneck speed. 

The other actor in the scene, Wyatt Russell, can also be seen trying to scramble out of the train's path.

Hurt and Russell somehow made it to safety. But,  several crew members  suffered injuries. 

Camera assistant Sarah Elizabeth Jones was tragically killed. She was just 27 years old.

The video also shows the crew desperately trying to get a bed off the track, which Hurt was laying on during the scene as they filmed a dream sequence while Russell played the guitar. 

Russell, the son of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, can be seen clearly in the video as he flees with a guitar still on his back. 

Footage taken just before the tragic incident unfolded was later edited and cut into a scene. It would have been used in the film if production hadn't been stopped.

Two weeks ago, the film's director, Randall Miller, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and will serve two years in a county jail and eight years probation while also paying a $20,000 fine.

Executive producer Jay Sedrish also pleaded guilty to the same charges and received 10 years probation. 

'We hope the sacrifice of our daughter's life will continue to change the film industry,' Jones' father, Richard Jones, told reporters outside the courthouse. 

'I believe it sends a message, frankly, that if you do not respect those you're in charge of, you may end up behind bars.'

In addition, Hillary Schwartz, an assistant director on the film, was also convicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and also received 10 years probation.

Charges against Miller's wife and business partner, Jody Savin, were dropped as part of his plea. 

Prosecutors said all three defendants knew that CSX Transportation, which owned the trestle spanning the Altamaha River, had denied them permission in writing to film on its tracks.

'It was a horrible tragedy that will haunt me forever,' Miller said in a statement provided by a publicist. 

'Although I relied on my team, it is ultimately my responsibility and was my decision to shoot the scripted scene that caused this tragedy.'

Assistant District Attorney John B. Johnson said Miller and the other filmmakers even attempted to rewrite the script to drop the scene they planned to shoot with actor William Hurt, in the role of Allman, in a hospital bed placed on the tracks.

Miller decided to shoot the scene anyway, Johnson said, after the owner of the property surrounding the tracks said the movie crew could access its land. 

He said Miller and his crew went onto the railroad bridge after mistakenly thinking no more trains would pass that day.

The train, traveling at 55mph, smashed into a metal-framed bed on the tracks, sending shrapnel flying as crew members scrambled for safety and clung to the bridge's metal railing high above the Altamaha River.

After his plea was accepted, Miller followed a sheriff's deputy from the courtroom to begin his two-year sentence at the Wayne County jail. He also agreed to serve an additional eight years on probation and pay a $20,000 fine.

Miller's attorney, Ed Garland, said he expects the director could be released from jail within a year. He said Miller accepted the plea deal to prevent prosecution of his wife, who left the courthouse in tears. Garland said the filmmaker never intended to put his crew at risk.

The incident occurred on February 20, 2014, the very first day of filming on the picture. 

Jones was first struck by a fuel tank and then fell on the tracks, being run over by the train seconds later.

Miller recalled the moment he was forced to call her parents and deliver the heartbreaking news that their daughter was dead. 

Filming was immediately suspended, and many in the industry began a push for better safety regulations in the aftermath of the tragedy.

A group called Slates for Sarah also began putting the words RIP Sarah Jones on film slates in her memory on programs including Girls, Scandal, Parks and Recreation, The Leftovers, Parenthood, Glee, The Mindy Project, Revenge and The Vampire Diaries, a show on which Jones had previously worked as an assistant.
