Tottenham’s interest in West Brom striker Saido Berahino is intensifying as they look to head the growing queue for the England Under 21 star.

The Baggies star has had an impressive start to the season, scoring six goals for Alan Irvine’s side as well as three more for the U21’s.

Spurs scouted the 21-year-old extensively last season and his excellent start to the current campaign has put the White Hart Lane club on red-alert.

But Tottenham know Berahino’s form has not gone unnoticed elsewhere, with Everton, Arsenal and Chelsea all having watched the forward last season.

Spurs are determined to stay ahead of the competition in the race for Berahino and are set to ramp up their interest in the coming weeks.

Berahino is known to be settled at the Hawthorns, though interest from one of England’s elite clubs could leave the youngster with a decision to make.

The forward signed a new three-and-half year deal in December, but could be in line for another improved deal should he continue his hot-streak.
