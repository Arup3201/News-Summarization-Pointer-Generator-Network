Russell Brand’s appearance on Question Time sparked a furious backlash against the BBC yesterday, with MPs calling the programme a ‘farce’

Russell Brand’s appearance on Question Time sparked a furious backlash against the BBC yesterday, with MPs calling the programme a ‘farce’ and viewers comparing it to The Jeremy Kyle Show.

The multi-millionaire comedian clashed with Ukip leader Nigel Farage on Thursday night’s tawdry edition of the corporation’s long-running current affairs show.

But unimpressed viewers complained that guests were simply shouting at each other and likened the broadcast to an episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show, which gets together troubled families in front of a studio audience for heated rows about topics such as infidelity and parenting.

On Twitter, viewer Alice Hassall, wrote: ‘Wow this is like posh Jeremy Kyle.’ Dr Sarah Quinnell posted: ‘Is this Question Time or is it in fact Jeremy Kyle? Will Dimblebot announce that Farage is Brand’s father?’

Labour MP Ian Austin said the once-great BBC show had become a ‘farce’, writing on Twitter: ‘The idea we have to pay the licence fee for this total and utter garbage. What a farce. What a terrible programme. Just terrible.’

As the row deepened last night, it also emerged that a man with a walking stick who mocked Mr Brand from the audience is related to a Ukip MEP.

Robert Carver, brother of Ukip West Midlands MEP James Carver, challenged Mr Brand to stand for Parliament. When Mr Brand replied: ‘I’m scared I’d become one of them’, Mr Carver, from Chislehurst, responded: ‘You can’t preach that, that’s rubbish!’

A blog post appeared on a website last month written by Rob Carver, identifying himself as the MEP’s brother and stating: ‘Rob has been asked by Ukip to stand as the party candidate in the Tory safe seat of Beckenham at the general election.’

Yesterday, a war of words also broke out between Mr Brand and Mr Farage. Mr Farage claimed the comedian had his chest hair ‘straightened’ before going on air

Another audience member, who repeatedly shouted that Mr Farage was racist and at one point screamed ‘I’m coming to get you’, was widely named as Socialist Workers’ Party activist Bunny La Roche, a member of Thanet Stand Up to Ukip, which is campaigning to stop Mr Farage becoming MP for Thanet South in Kent.

Yesterday, a war of words also broke out between Mr Brand and Mr Farage. Mr Farage claimed the comedian had his chest hair ‘straightened’ before going on air, saying: ‘Everyone fancied that Mr Brand and I might butt heads. But as we entered the studio, and his personal make-up artist straightened his chest hair for him – I kid you not – I realised that perhaps he might be a bit lighter weight than expected.’

The comedian hit back by suggesting Mr Farage had been drinking before his appearance. On his blog, he wrote: ‘Nigel Farage in the flesh, gin blossomed flesh that it is, inspires sympathy more than fear.’

A spokesman for Mr Farage rejected the suggestion that he had too much to drink – although accepted Mr Farage may have had a ‘small G&T’.
