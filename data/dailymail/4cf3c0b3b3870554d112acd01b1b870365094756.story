Devastated: Father Garry Mackay, mother Wendy MacDonald and their daughter Callie Mackay pictured at the funeral of five-year-old Grace Mackay

A father who survived a canoeing accident in which his youngest daughter, best friend and two boys died has broken his silence about the tragedy.

Garry Mackay said he did everything he could to save lives but had to make ‘the hardest decision of his life’ to leave his children in the water with a friend and his family in Loch Gairloch to swim to shore and raise the alarm.

Mr Mackay was speaking after the  accident near Gairloch, Wester Ross, on August 26 in which his five-year-old daughter Grace, friend Ewen Beaton, 32, of Beauly, Inverness-shire, and his sons Ewen, five, and two-year-old Jamie died.

Mr Mackay said he did not realise the youngsters were only wearing buoyancy aids and not life jackets and added that he had believed that, even in cold waters, ‘they would be OK’.

The group, including Mr Mackay’s eight-year-old daughter Callie, had taken Mr Beaton’s recently acquired Canadian canoe out to sea before eventually going to deeper water where they could fish between the mainland and Longa Island.

Mr Mackay, of Muir of Ord, Inverness-shire, said that as they paddled they were chatting happily about dolphins, basking sharks and killer whales.

But in a split second the canoe capsized and all six were suddenly fighting for their lives.

Mr Mackay had caught mackerel and went to put them in a box. He said: ‘I stood up and turned around and the boat tilted four of five inches from the water before righting itself.

‘I went to put a fish in the box and the boat tilted the other way to the side where Ewen was bringing up more fish, and almost in slow motion it capsized.’

Panic ensued and Mr Beaton was screaming ‘Help’. Mr Mackay said: ‘I thought, we will hold onto the boat and someone will  rescue us.’ However, the boat sank, leaving the six stranded.

Mr Mackay said he is unsure about what happened next but he saw Mr Beaton swim a few feet before he went under.

He said Mr Beaton resurfaced and shouted at his sons to let go of him. Mr Mackay added: ‘Ewen said “I’ve let go” and I knew that was him away.’ Mr Mackay set off, leaving Ewen Jnr holding onto his brother Jamie, who was conscious.

Mr Mackay had no life jacket and, with no one in sight, he made the decision to swim for shore. He said: ‘It was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make but I knew if I stayed I would drown too, and the kids would never be found.

‘I turned to Gracie first. I will always remember her scared little face. I told her, “You have to bob in the water like Callie”.’

He added: ‘I believed the children were wearing life jackets. I thought that if I got help they would be OK because although their bodies slow down with the cold, children can survive for quite a long time at sea.

The family day out ended in tragedy when the canoe overturned and Grace, pictured, was found floating in the water

‘I didn’t realise they were only wearing buoyancy aids which don’t keep your head out of water if you lose consciousness.’

Once ashore, Mr Mackay ran a mile in bare feet to seek help before being reunited with Callie, who had also swum ashore.

Mr Beaton’s sons were airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but lost their fight for life, while Grace, who had been found face down, was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.

The following day, doctors told Mr Mackay and his partner Wendy MacDonald there was nothing more they could do.

He said: ‘She was so kind and caring. And that’s what makes it so hard – I haven’t had a clean past, I have done things I’m not proud of, but she was perfect.’ He admitted he fears others may judge him about what happened on that day. He said: ‘As far as what happened, my conscience is clear. I did everything I could.’

Mr Mackay now wants to set up a memorial to honour the five and he wants to highlight the difference between buoyancy aids and life jackets so similar tragedies can be averted.

LochWatch Loch Awe, a volunteer group formed after the 2009 incident in which four Glasgow fishermen drowned on the Argyll loch, has called for new laws to make wearing life jackets compulsory.

A fatal accident inquiry into the tragedy heard that if the men had been wearing properly functioning life jackets they might have survived.

Les Currie, 60, father of Craig Currie, one of  the four men who died, said: ‘It has to be the Scottish Government that does something because we are talking about Scottish waters.

‘They are coming out with lots of silly laws, but this is a law that will save lives.’

LochWatch Loch Awe is being supported in its call for a compulsory life jacket law by Argyll and Bute Nationalist MSP Michael Russell.

He said: ‘You wouldn’t get in a car without wearing a seatbelt, so why would you get in a boat without a life jacket?

‘I am taking the Loch Awe message to  Holyrood and will be asking the Community Safety Minister to meet LochWatch Loch Awe.’
