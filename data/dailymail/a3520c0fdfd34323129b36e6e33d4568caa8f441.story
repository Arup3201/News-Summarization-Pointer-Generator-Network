To honor the memory of Michael Brown, his family laid out a place setting for him as they sat down to Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday night. 

The 18-year-old was shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson in a daylight altercation in Ferguson, Missouri, that sparked unrest all over the country.

His family hope their solemn gesture will help to highlight the perceived injustice of a grand jury ruling that the policeman should not stand trial.

In a sign of how much their story has affected people, it turned out the Browns weren't the only ones setting a place for a missing loved one ,The New York Daily News reported.

A picture of the family shows six members sitting around a table in Ferguson about to eat.

They are staring at a T-shirt draped over an empty shirt, looking completely depleted after what was a devastating week.

The image was posted online by the advocacy group Ferguson Action.

The caption read: 'Mike Brown's family sits at the table for their first holiday dinner without him. #StolenLives'

According to the group's head, Mervyn Marcano, the online campaign #StolenLives is an attempt to show people 'that the victims of police violence are loved and remembered by their families and communities'.

'While some, like Darren Wilson, see ''demons'' we see our brothers, sisters and friends,' Marcano told The Daily News.

'Their lives matter.'

Many seem to have agreed and followed suit.

Not a celebration: Thanksgiving was solemn for the family of Michael Brown and more this year

Last Saturday, Michael Brown Sr. handed out turkeys to people in Ferguson as part of the St. Louis suburb's annual turkey giveaway.

Then on Monday the grand jury decision was handed down.

Lesley McSpadden, mother of the slain teen, said she couldn't imagine celebrating Thanksgiving without her son.

'I don't even want to think about tomorrow being Thanksgiving, it's just Thursday,' she told Al Sharpton on Wednesday.

'I don't even plan to celebrate because I can't.'
