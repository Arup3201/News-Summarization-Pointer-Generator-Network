Hundreds of mourners gathered at a memorial for slain U.S. envoy to Libya Christopher Stevens, as the Libyan ambassador to Washington called him a 'friend and hero' and apologised for his death on behalf of the government in Tripoli.

Stevens, 52, who was killed in September in an attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, was remembered at a service in the marble rotunda at San Francisco's City Hall.

The solemn service yesterday was attended by former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, Rep Barbara Lee and Sen Dianne Feinstein.

Ali Aujali, the Libyan ambassador to the United States, told mourners: 'On behalf of the Libyan government, we're very sorry.'

He added: 'You sent us one of your best diplomats, but unfortunately, we were unable to protect him.'

'He's part of Libyan history, the revolution,' Aujali said of Stevens, who was raised in the San Francisco area. 'We lost a friend and a hero.'

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Monday she took responsibility for the security situation at the U.S. compound prior to the September 11 attack that killed four Americans.

The attack has become the subject of fierce partisan debate in the U.S. presidential campaign.

But in contrast to the recent firestorm over Stevens' death and the security arrangements in place at the U.S. mission, political leaders from both parties set aside their differences on Tuesday to honor Stevens.

The Benghazi attack was a major point of
contention during last night's presidential debate, when Mitt Romney 
blasted the president for his response to the assault that led to 
Stevens' death and the deaths of three other Americans.

Romney questioned whether or not Obama had called the consulate attack an 'act of terror' in his Rose Garden address on September 12,  the day after the assault.

While Obama cut across Romney - saying 'look at the transcript' - debate moderator Candy Crowley seemed to back up the President, telling the Republican governor that Obama did 'call it an act of terror.'

Her interjection drew applause from the audience, led by Mrs Obama, but angered political commentators, who accused Crowley of stepping in on behalf of the President.

The Stevens memorial service began with the National Anthem sung by members of the University of California Men's Glee Club, and speakers included retired U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering, who heads a State Department panel investigating the attacks that killed Stevens and his three colleagues.

Pickering recalled that when then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's security forces were trailing Stevens, he stole their camera and started photographing them. 'They were so dumbfounded they had to laugh,' he said.

Friends described Stevens as humble and always interested in others. 

Stevens' sister, Dr Anne Stevens Sullivan, said he made friends everywhere, even in elevators, where he would strike up a conversation in French.

Also fluent in Arabic, Stevens served as deputy ambassador to Libya from 2007 to 2009.

Putting politics aside: Political leaders like Sen Dianne Feinstein were among attendees during the memorial service

In April 2011, he became a special envoy to Libya and traveled aboard a Greek cargo ship to Benghazi, where he set up a diplomatic outpost in support of the rebel opposition.

In August 2011, rebel forces backed by NATO power ousted Gaddafi. 

He was captured and killed two months later. In May, Clinton rewarded Stevens' work in Libya by swearing him in as U.S. ambassador.

Family members said Stevens' ashes would be interred near his grandfather and other relatives in his birthplace of Grass Valley, California.
