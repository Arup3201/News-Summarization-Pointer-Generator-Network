The search for a well-liked Texas doctor who was reported missing after not surfacing following a shark-diving excursion in the Bahamas over the weekend has ended, the U.S. Coast Guard announced on Wednesday.

No body has been recovered, but search crews found dive and camera equipment they believe belonged to 63-year-old chiropractor John E. Petty, who also was an avid photographer.

Petty was part of a multi-day shark-diving excursion near Tiger Beach, a well-known spot for commercial shark-diving operations.

Eight other divers were part of the excursion, where the water is baited with chum to attract sharks, and divers enter the water without the safety of shark cages.

On Sunday, when the other members of the excursion surfaced after a dive, Petty wasn't amongst them.

At 8 p.m., Shear Water, the 65-foot vessel used to transport divers to the dive site, issued a distress call to alert the Coast Guard that Petty was missing.

Coast Guard Petty Officer John-Paul Rios said Wednesday that a 'substantial amount' of dive gear had been found within the search area, but it could not be immediately confirmed that the gear belonged to the missing man.

'The family would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming 
support and prayers on behalf of John Petty. The U.S. Coast Guard has 
ceased its search as of 11:00 a.m., today,' Petty's family said in a statement given to KETK. 'After the Bahamian Government
 studied the items recovered in numerous searches, it has been 
determined that a shark attack was the cause. A memorial service is 
being planned and details will be posted later today. Thank you all 
again.'

Jim Abernathy, who runs the Florida-based dive company that Petty hired for the excursion, is well-known in the world of shark diving. The website grindtv.com describes him as a 'controversial figure among the commercial shark-diving fraternity.'

In 2008, a participant in one of Abernathy's excursions was fatally attacked by a shark during a dive. In 2011, Abernathy himself was bitten by a shark. He survived after being airlifted to a Florida hospital.

SharkDiver.com's Patric Douglas describes Tiger Beach as 'an ongoing lab experiment.'

'Tiger Beach has been a long running experiment with large predatory 
sharks and a number of "firsts" for the cageless shark-diving industry,' he writes on the website. 
'First to night dive with these sharks, first to hand-feed these animals,
 first to film a woman dressed as a mermaid with baited sharks, first to
 stand tigers on their noses for paying customers in a controversial 
shark interaction called "tonic shark." There are few animal interaction boundaries that have not been explored at this remote and well-known shark site.'
