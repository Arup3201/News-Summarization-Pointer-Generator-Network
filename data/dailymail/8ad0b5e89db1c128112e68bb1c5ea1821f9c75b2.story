The U.S. Open tennis referee accused of bludgeoning her 80-year-old husband to death with a coffee mug has a string of ailments, including two knee replacements, that mean she could not have carried out the gruesome murder, her lawyer has insisted.

Lois Ann Goodman suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, 
hearing loss and constant spinal pain that's controlled by an electronic
device implanted in her spine, her attorney Alison Triessl said in a filing.

She also underwent a shoulder replacement and is awaiting another, the lawyer added.

'It is physically impossible for her to have done this,' Triessl said after filing the motion on Monday.

Goodman, who is well-known in professional tennis circles, stands accused of murdering her husband, Alan, at their condominium in Los Angeles, California on April 17 by smashing a coffee mug over his head and stabbing him to death with the sharp, broken handle.

The mother of three told authorities she had arrived home to find the blood-covered coffee mug and her husband lying in bed not breathing after apparently falling down the stairs.

But after paramedics and investigators became suspicious of the man's grisly injuries - including deep wounds to his head - Goodman was arrested on a murder charge.

She was arrested last week in New York, 
where she was preparing for this week's U.S. Open - just one 
of many high-profile tournaments she had worked since 1979.

She was extradited back to Los 
Angeles and her lawyer has now pleaded with a judge to reduce her $1 
million bail to $100,000 or release her on electronic monitoring.

Plea: She was extradited back to Los Angeles for her trial, but her lawyer has asked for her bail to be reduced

'Mrs. Goodman is not a danger to any person or the community,' Triessl wrote in the motion.

She said there was no chance Goodman would flee as she does not have a passport and has strong ties to the San Fernando Valley where she was born and raised.

She added that Goodman cooperated with the police investigation and submitted to three interviews, even driving herself to the police station when she was summoned.

'She arrived on time and was utterly forthcoming,' Triessl said.

Given Goodman's cooperation, she said the Los Angeles Police Department should have waited to arrest her; they could have asked her to turn herself in in California and she would have obliged.

Triessl also gave the court 40 
testimonial letters from colleagues, neighbours, family and friends, 
lauding Goodman as a beloved friend, mother and grandmother who treated 
her husband like a king.

'Victim': Her husband of nearly 50 years, Alan (left), was found covered in blood next to a broken coffee mug. His wife told police she had found him after returning home and believed he had fallen

She has a bail hearing set for Wednesday.

After police swooped on her as she had breakfast in her New York hotel last week, the elderly tennis referee was pictured in her U.S. Open tracksuit as she was ferried between courts.

Claims have also emerged that she was having an affair, after police found emails and handwritten letters to another man during a search of the house.

'Lois minimised what she had seen,' Detective Jeffrey Briscoe of the Los Angeles Police Department said of an interview four days after the death. 'Loisâ€™ emotional reaction to what she had seen and the loss of her husband was not typical of a grieving spouse.'

She had told detective she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood. She followed the blood to her bedroom, where she found her husband not breathing, according to the affidavit. She then called 911.

Questions: Goodman, right, features in a sketch in a Manhattan court last Friday before she was sent to L.A.

Before he could be cremated, investigators intercepted the body and found multiple lacerations on the right side of his head, three cuts on his right ear and a blunt force trauma not consistent with a fall, the Daily News reported.

Investigators also deemed the large stain of blood near the stairs suggested he had suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said.

When she was questioned again, Goodman said the body looked as if it had been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts, Goodman has protested her innocence.

She has refereed at the U.S. and Australian Opens for years and has umpired with some of the world's top tennis players, including matches with Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova.

In a 1994 interview with the L.A. Times, she said: 'It's exciting. This is my favorite sport and I'm out there rubbing shoulders with the best players. There's no real way to describe it.'
