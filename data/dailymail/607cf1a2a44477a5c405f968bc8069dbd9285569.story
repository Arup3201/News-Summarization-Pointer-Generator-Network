Princess Madeleine and her American husband, banker Christopher O'Neill, have decided that their first child should be born in New York City.

The palace said on Saturday the couple had decided to do so after 'careful consideration' and consulting with her parents, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia.

The Swedish Newspaper The Local reports that royal expert Roger Lundgren has explained that Madeline's decision to give birth may ruffle some at home.

'Many here at home will probably be 
disappointed, they want their princess back home in Sweden, as part of 
the royal family. The fact that Madeleine will give birth abroad cements
 a distance to her,' said Lundgren.

On the contrary, Lundgren also says there were certain factors such as a difficult pregnancy that might make it hard for the princess to travel home. He called her decision 'purely practical.'

'She has had a tough pregnancy, she missed the Nobel banquette for example, and it is simply more convenient to give birth there than in Sweden,' he said.

According to Swedish lifestyle magazine 
Svensk Damtidning, the 31-year-old royal and her husband Christopher 
O'Neill are welcoming a daughter into the world on February 25.

The Princess has yet to confirm the reports herself, but a Swedish Royal Court spokeswoman told Svenskdam.se that the information is indeed true.

The younger sister of Crown Princess 
Victoria, Madeleine is fourth in line to the Swedish throne. The baby 
will be fifth in line.

Sweden's one-time 'party princess' lives with her British-American husband, 39, in New York where she works for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her mother, Queen Silvia.

The couple met after Princess Madeleine fled to the U.S. in 2010 with a broken heart.

She crossed the Atlantic following the breakdown of her first engagement to Swedish attorney Jonas Bergstrom amid speculation that he had cheated on her.

Rumours of a romance with Mr O'Neill first emerged in early 2011 when the pair were seen together at the Central Park Boathouse.

A source told the New York Post at the time: 'She is always happy when she is with him.'

Madeleine says she and her husband were friends first, and a relationship blossomed over time.

'I appreciate Chris for his warmth and his humor,' she said. 'He has a very big heart and he manages to make everyone in his presence feel good. Christopher is a very thoughtful and generous person.

Mr O'Neill, however, says that 'from the very outset, I immediately felt something special with Madeleine.'

Insiders predicted an engagement last year when Crown Princess Victoria gave birth to a baby, Princess Estelle, and Mr O'Neill accompanied Madeleine to Estelle's baptism ceremony that May - a significant indicator, as partners of royals are usually not invited to such occasions unless they are officially engaged.

And they were spot on. The couple announced their engagement in October 2012, confirmed in a brief video clip posted on the royal website.

'Chris proposed to me in New York at the start of October, and we are very happy,' Madeleine said in the video, which was recorded Wednesday at the Drottningholm Palace outside Stockholm.

Madeleine described the proposal as 'very romantic and intimate' but would not reveal anything beyond that.

Sweden has a constitutional monarchy in which the royals primarily serve as figureheads. King Carl XVI Gustaf is the country's head of state, but his powers are limited to ceremonial duties.
