Four Wisconsin middle school students have been arrested after allegedly throwing a 'sex party' off campus and recording it on their phones. 

Police are recommending that the students, who could be as young as 13, be charged with first and second-degree sexual assault of a minor. 

Authorities say several students attended the 'sex party' at a classmate's home in Brown Deer, Wisconsin, during the holiday break, WISN-TV reports. 

The four students, who could be as young as 13, have been referred to prosecutors to face charges up to first and second-degree sexual assault of a minor

Only four are accused of participating in sex acts during the party. 

Police do not believe the students posted the videos they recorded on social media.  

The allegations shocked the small, middle-class Milwaukee suburb and horrified parents.  

Police got involved when one student told teachers at Brown Deer Middle School about the party.

School administrators called detectives, who opened a criminal investigation.

The case has been referred to prosecutors, who will decide how to charge the teens.  

'We're trying to send a clear message that this type of behavior isn't going to be condoned by law enforcement, nor school officials, nor shouldn't be by parents, really, when we're talking kids that are middle-school age,' Brown Deer Police Chief Michael Kass told WISN.

School administrators said that because the incident happened off school grounds, there is nothing they can do about it. 

However, they credited their work educating students to report criminal activity if they see it.
