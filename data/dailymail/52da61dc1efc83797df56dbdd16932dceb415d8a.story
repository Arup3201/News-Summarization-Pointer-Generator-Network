A teenager who sexually assaulted a woman near a Perth train station on his 15th birthday has avoided immediate detention and been warned by a magistrate to 'get off the porn'.

The boy, who cannot be named, was sentenced in the West Australian Children's Court on Thursday to a 10-month conditional release order, which includes 80 hours of community service and counselling.

The court heard the 22-year-old victim was attacked after getting off a train at Warwick station in October.

The boy grabbed the woman from behind, touched her breast and put his hand under her skirt before she broke free and said: 'What the f*** are you doing?'

Defence lawyer Hylton Quail said the boy had developed an addiction to pornography and, as he went through puberty, his Christian family did not discuss sexuality.

He said the boy was trying to act out what he had become obsessed with from watching pornography, which was to grab her bottom, but as he started acting out his fantasy it escalated.

Mr Quail described the teenager as a 'silly young boy' whose parents had since stopped him from accessing the internet on his own at night.

Prosecutor Genevieve Cleary said the attack was premeditated but unsophisticated because the teenager was wearing his school uniform and could be easily identified.

'This was a random, frightening attack on a young woman who was simply going about her business,' she said.

Magistrate Andree Horrigan noted letters from the boy's coach, principal and family friends who said they were stunned, deeply shocked and surprised by the offending.

But she said they did not know about the boy's 'nocturnal activities'.

She added that the crime was degrading and invasive.

'I could not imagine a more serious set of circumstances,' she said.

'It's just disgusting.'

Magistrate Horrigan said the boy's behaviour was 'entirely and grossly unacceptable' and warned him to be more respectful.

'You do not know what you take from people when you behave like this,' she said.

'You take people's confidence ... It's going to have a lasting impact on her.'
