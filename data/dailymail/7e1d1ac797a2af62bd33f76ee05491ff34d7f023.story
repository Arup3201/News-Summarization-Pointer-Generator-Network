Their make-up is immaculate, their hair blow-dried to perfection, but, oh no! In a split second on her way out of the gym, our future Queen stumbles and spills orange juice all over her sister, Pippa.Â  Or, at least, that's what it looks like.

These pictures, the latest lookalike shots by spoof celebrity photographer Alison Jackson, imagine the scene when the glossy Middleton sisters have a mishap at their gym.

Kate' is shown to mistakenly drench her younger sister with her post-workout drink, before hurriedly helping her mop it up.

Artist Miss Jackson, who is well-known for using realistic lookalikes in her comedy photo shoots, also took photographs of what appear to be the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and Prime Minister, David Cameron.

The mayor looked to have well and truly blown away his relationship 
with his former Eton and Oxford chum in these pictures, as he sneezes all over the 
horror-struck Prime Minister.

The images show Mr Johnson seemingly making a right Eton mess, leaving Mr Cameron to ponder the cost of his dry cleaning bill.

Miss Jackson took the shots of how she imagined celebrities might look as part of an ad campaign for tissue manufacturers, Kleenex.
