It was 12 years ago that David Seaman pulled off one of the most iconic saves in FA Cup history against Sheffield United at Old Trafford - and the former Arsenal keeper says it's the best one he ever made.

Arsene Wenger's side were hanging by a thread against their lower league opponents, when Paul Peschisolido headed what looked like an equaliser but Seaman somehow managed to hook it away from goal - leaving players and fans speechless.

The 51-year-old revealed to the Daily Mirror, that the save was the best of his career and topped his penalty heroics at Euro 96 for England.

David Seaman says this save against Sheffield United was the best one he ever made during his career

The former England international went on the win the FA Cup with Arsenal in the same season

He said: 'I was fortunate enough to make one or two important saves from penalties for England, but from open play that one at Old Trafford was probably the best.'

Arsenal are in formidable form this season and are currently in the midst of an eight-game winning streak but Seaman warns his former side that they shouldn't underestimate Reading.

'It was special because that was the 1,000th competitive appearance of my career for Arsenal and England, and for the final against Southampton, Arsene Wenger made me captain for the day because Patrick Vieira was injured, which was obviously a massive honour.

Seaman believes the save tops his penalty heroics for England - including the Euro 96 shootouts 

'Although I didn't know it at the time, it turned out to be my last game for Arsenal.

'I went to Manchester City in the summer but six months later I had to retire because of a shoulder injury.

'That shows you should never take anything for granted in football, and I hope we (Arsenal) are not going to fall into that trap against Reading.'
