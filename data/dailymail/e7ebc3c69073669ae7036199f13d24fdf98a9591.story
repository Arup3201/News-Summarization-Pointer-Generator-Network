Anyone who saw Jessica Biel at the Cannes Film Festival can be in little doubt of her natural stunning beauty, but now her make-up artist Lisa Eldridge has bowed to demand and revealed exactly how she achieved that dewy look.

Lisa was inundated with requests of how to re-create the look, with many brides-to-be wanting to recreate it for their big day.

Lisa says: ‘It is one of those looks that’s perfect for that type of thing as it works on so many different types of skin tones and different ages.’

The finished look Lisa shows her fans how to create is perfect for a blushing bride

The fresh natural look will give you a rosy glow and is suitable for many skin types and ages

She suggests starting your skin make up with ‘Make up forever HD’ which is ideal for occasions where you anticipate being photographed a lot such as your wedding day.

Using both a foundation and a Kabuki brash she applies the fine textured foundation carefully, covering a larger area than normal.

‘As this is special occasion make-up I’m going to take it down a little onto the neck, and maybe the chest if you’re wearing a dress that is low at the front.

‘This just makes sure all the skin is even.’

The next step on your road to a perfect wedding glow is Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector.

Lisa suggests applying several, very thin layers to the cheekbone with a foundation brush before gently patting the edges to blend it in.

A Channel crème blush is applied to the apples of the cheeks and blended out ward with fingers to achieve a rosy glow.

Lisa preps the eye area by using Nars Pro Prime Smudge Proof eye shadow base all around the eye area, before using a Dior eye shadow palette in rosy, plummy shades.

For a special occasion look Lisa suggests bring the foundation down round the neck and even chest area to ensure skin is smooth

A ‘shimmery, sable mink’ colour is aopplied lightly all over the lids, then a plumy shade is blended softly into the outer corner of the lid to define and give the eye.

Lisa then uses a mixer of the two shade to line the lower lid before adding a little more of the darker shade to further define the outer corner.

A sweep of the rose colour is added, before a light wash of the highlighter on the brown bone to create a subtle look.

Lisa applies concealer after eye shadow to avoid any smudges caused by the eye shadow dropping onto the under eye area.

Pink, plum and nude eye shadows create a natural fresh look

It also allows time for the foundation to sink in and the areas that need concealer to become more apparent.

A light layer of powder gives a velvety look which works well for the infamous wedding photos.

Black mauve waterproof eyeliner is worked into the base of the lashes, thickening out slightly towards the outer corners of the eye.

Lisa then curls the lashes before applying Giorgio Armani ‘eyes to kill’ waterproof mascara, which will stay put all day, before lashes are thickened by adding individual lashes gently to the upper lid.

Individual fake lashes are applied with tweezers to thicken the lashes as well as mascara and eyeliner

In order to ensure your lips are smooth, Lisa rubs a cotton bub over the lips before applying Bobbi brown lip liner as a stain across the whole lips.

The finishing touch is Tom Ford pink-nude lip colour, and a light touch of powder blusher with a touch of shimmer in.

Lisa admits that Jessica Beil added to the look further by adding a touch of silver eye shadow on top of Lisa’s palette of pinks and plums to complement the stunning silver dress she wore to the Cannes Film Festival.
