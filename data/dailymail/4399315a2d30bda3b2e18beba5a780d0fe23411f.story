The Mayor of London, Transport for London and Santander have announced a seven-year partnership, which will see ‘Boris bikes’ turn from blue to red.

The deal worth £43.75m is the largest public sector sponsorship in the world, and from April 11,500 of the new red-and-white bikes – renamed ‘Santander Cycles’ – will be available across London.

An additional 750 docking stations and 32 maintenance vehicles will also be added to improve the service, and staff uniforms and membership keys will be rebranded.

The deal is worth £43.75m and is the largest public sector sponsorship in the world, fulfilling Transport for London’s wish to secure a minimum of £5.5m a year

Mayor Boris Johnson believes that the joint vision and Santander’s marketing expertise will help take the Cycle Hire scheme to a new level.

He said: ‘As everyone knows, London buses, phone kiosks and post boxes are red.

‘In Santander Cycles, we have a new red icon symbolising the Capital to Londoners, and the world. I am thrilled to welcome them.’

A smartphone app will also help make it easier for customers to find a bike and to pay the £2-a-day or £90-a-year hire charge.

The deal is a 25 per cent real-terms increase on the £25m Barclays contract that began in 2010 – which was worth £5m a year – and fulfils Transport for London’s wish to secure a minimum of £5.5m a year.

‘It couldn't be a better time to get involved in cycling.’
