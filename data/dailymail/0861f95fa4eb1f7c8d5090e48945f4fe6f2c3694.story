A trio of teenagers from Tennessee have been indicted in connection to a 2013 murder and robbery of a married father of two.

Derek Cunningham, 15, and Corey Sandifer, 16, and Thomas Moss, 17, are accused of shooting dead John Palmer Shelley, 42, as they attempted to rob him October 4, 2013.

At the time of the deadly shooting, Mr Shelley, who was a contractor, was renovating a house in the 4700 block of Scottsdale Avenue in Memphis.

On Tuesday, a grand jury indicted the three suspects on charges of first-degree murder in perpetration of a robbery, especially aggravated robbery, and aggravated robbery, the station WMCTV reported.

Cunningham, the youngest of the three, also faces one count of premeditated first-degree murder. All three teens are being held without bond.

On October 4, 2013, John 'J.P.' Shelley and construction worker Octavio Sanchez were making renovation estimates on a home at 4776 Scottsdale Avenue when they were ambushed by three teens who demanded their possessions.

During a hearing last December, Sanchez testified that both he and Shelley handed over their billfolds, an iPhone and an iPad to their assailants, WREG reported.

Sanchez quoted his colleague as saying to the suspected robbers: 'If you want the money, it's no problem.'

However, after the 42-year-old man gave up his wallet, he was fatally shot in the neck. Sanchez escaped unharmed.

‘They had robbed my family of such a wonderful man,’ Beverly Shelley, the victim’s widow, said shortly after the tragedy. 

Despite their young age, both Cunningham and Sandifer have extensive criminal histories, MyFox Memphis reported last year.  

Cunningham was charged with domestic assault in 2009 when he was only 11 years old. Since then, he was picked up by police 14 times on charges including aggravated sexual battery and resisting arrest.

Family man: Shelley had quit his job a year before his murder to take care of his elderly father

Sandifer has been before a judge seven times in two years on assault, vandalism and other counts.

Those who knew J.P. Shelley described him as an exemplary family man who loved his wife of nearly 19 years, Beverly, and their two children, Palmer and Emme.

A year before his murder, Mr Shelley quit his job to help take care of his elderly father.

In 2013, he went back to work part-time as a contractor. On the day of his murder, his son turned seven years old.
