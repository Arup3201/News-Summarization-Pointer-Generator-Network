Abbie Keers, from County Durham, almost lost sight in her right eye and underwent emergency plastic surgery after a thug threw a beer bottle at the car she was travelling in

These are the shocking injuries sustained by a nine-year-old girl after a thug hurled a bottle at her family’s car.

Abbie Keers screamed in  terror as the car window shattered, sending shards of  glass into her face and almost blinding her.

The schoolgirl – who had been sitting in the front passenger seat – suffered gashes to her forehead, nose and hands.

And she almost lost the sight in her left eye as the glass cut just inside the socket.

An horrific picture showed the extent of the youngster’s  injuries, with blood streaming down her cheek and nose into her mouth.

Abbie underwent emergency plastic surgery and doctors fear her face may be scarred for life.

Yesterday police appealed  for information to catch the yob who threw a beer bottle at the vehicle in a random act of mindless violence.

Her mother Clare Webb, 29, of Stanley, County Durham, said: ‘It was terrifying, I’m still in shock now.

'It was a huge shock when it happened and I really panicked as Abbie was screaming about her face. It was one of the worst nights of my life – it was so scary.

‘Abbie will be scarred and that is upsetting.

'Every time that she looks in the mirror she will  be reminded of what happened that day. She has not looked at herself yet.’

She added: ‘I’m really angry at what’s happened as it was such a mindless act. People who do this should be named and shamed.’

The incident happened at around 10.30pm on Friday when Miss Webb was in a silver Fiat Punto car with her mother Sandra Webb, and daughters Abbie and three-year-old Lexi.

They were driving to a walk-in medical centre as Lexi was feeling unwell.

Miss Webb was on the back seat of the car comforting the three-year-old, who had been sick shortly before the journey.

As
 they drove along the A693 in Stanley, someone threw the glass bottle 
from a subway, hitting the front passenger side window where Abbie was 
sitting and playing on her iPad.

Grandmother
 Sandra, 58, a former police officer who was driving at the time, said: 
‘It was like the biggest explosion and sounded similar to when an air 
bag goes off in a car.

‘I 
didn’t know where the noise had come from or if a tyre had blown. As I 
was driving I turned and saw Abbie’s face was covered in blood and she 
was crying and screaming in the front passenger seat.’

She added: ‘There
 was blood pouring from her face and, as the car stopped, Clare quickly 
got out of the back seat and opened the front passenger door, which is 
when we saw the glass bottle in the footwell.’

Abbie is a keen gymnast and has won a number of gold medals in the sport

Miss Webb called an ambulance and Abbie was taken to the  University Hospital of North Durham.

Doctors
 decided to operate straight away. She has now returned home to recover.
 The schoolgirl is not expected to require any further surgery, but was 
been very upset by the incident, said her mother.

Miss
 Webb described her daughter as ‘quieter than usual’ but she bravely 
went ahead and competed in a gymnastics event yesterday, winning a 
silver medal.

The girl’s 
grandmother added: ‘Abbie is quite a resilient little girl and she has 
done well to cope with what she has. She is quiet until she gets to know
 people and I’m worried that this will affect her confidence.’

The family were last night due to give statements to police investigating the incident.

Acting
 Chief Inspector Karen Naunton of Durham Police described the incident 
as a ‘mindless act’ and appealed  for anyone with information  to 
contact police.
