Criticism: Ed Miliband unveiling his reforms yesterday

Ed Miliband’s reform of Labour’s trade union links was denounced as a ‘complete sham’ last night after it emerged it could leave union barons even richer and more powerful.

The Labour leader yesterday unveiled what he billed as ‘big and historic changes’ to the way union members give money to his party.

Mr Miliband’s proposal to end the automatic affiliation of union members to the party could cost it part of its income, with some commentators suggesting that as much as £5million of the £9million is at stake.

Tony Blair hailed the move as ‘a real act of leadership’. The former prime minister admitted he probably should have taken the same step when he led the party from 1994 to 2007.

The explosive reaction expected from the unions did not materialise, as Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said he was ‘very comfortable’ with the proposals – which he said could in fact result in tens of thousands more union members joining Labour.

In addition, the man Mr Miliband put in charge of the reforms, former Labour general secretary Ray Collins, actually helped set up Unite.

Denouncing the plans, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These reforms are a complete sham and no more than a tactical distraction.

They do nothing to deal with the scandal around Falkirk or the fact that Unite has fixed the selection of 41 candidates in key marginal seats.

‘No wonder Len McCluskey has been smiling. The only result of these reforms are they will increase the coffers of Unite and his spending power.’

The measures are designed to draw a line under the biggest crisis of Mr Miliband’s leadership, as police probe claims that Unite tried to fix the selection of Labour’s general election candidate in Falkirk by packing the constituency with 100 or more of its own members.

In a London speech, Mr Miliband said Falkirk represented ‘part of the death-throes of the old politics’, and he hoped to usher in an ‘open, transparent and trusted’ era.

Rather than being automatically affiliated, union members should be asked to make an active decision to join the party by opting in.

They would no longer automatically pay a £3 fee to the party from their union subscriptions and would instead have to opt in.

Yet, while Labour risks losing millions of pounds from the political levy, unions will lose nothing since they will be able to keep the money that would have been paid to Labour for themselves.

Miliband aides admitted there is nothing to stop union barons using that cash to make one-off payments to Labour’s election war chest instead.

If membership rises, union bosses could also end up with more power to pick Labour MPs – even though the reforms are ostensibly designed to loosen their grip on selections.

Three million members of unions affiliated to Labour pay the levy, one million are Unite members.

Union members who opt-in will become affiliate members of the party and would win new rights to vote in primary elections to pick Labour candidates.

Mr Miliband said: ‘In the 21st century it just doesn’t make sense for anyone to be affiliated to a political party unless they have chosen to do so.’

Mr McCluskey yesterday predicted that 100,000 of his members would keep paying the levy, giving the most powerful union baron a block of supporters.

He said the move could swell party membership from 200,000 to ‘a far higher number’ and admitted Lord Collins will now have to consider how the changes will affect union power in leadership elections and during votes at Labour conference, where the unions control 50 per cent of the votes.

Aides admitted that in leadership elections ‘the electoral college could stay’, meaning unions will retain 30 per cent of the vote which helped Mr Miliband to defeat his brother.

Mr Miliband dismissed claims that Lord Collins is a union stooge.

But in a blow to the leader, former Labour general secretary Larry Whitty revealed he turned down the job because it was ‘unworkable’.

Mr McCluskey was delighted that Mr Miliband refused to change the law to force unions to give up the cash from the levy if members opt out.

He said: ‘Those who pay the levy, he wants them to have a second option to see whether they want to opt in to becoming associate members of the Labour Party.’

David Cameron denounced the plans as a ‘smokescreen’.

Further allegations last night appeared to suggest rigging was not confined to Falkirk alone.

Karen Webb, a former candidate in Peterborough, alleged that Unite fixed the selection in favour of its candidate, Lisa Forbes.

Miss Forbes was named on a list of candidates whose selection Unite boasted they had secured. Unite denied the claims.

Ed Miliband sought to regain the initiative yesterday amid questions over who really controls his party. Here we analyse the speech he never wanted to give.

WHAT HE SAID: ‘What we saw in Falkirk is part of the death-throes of the old politics... it comes against growing mistrust in politics.‘As the Labour Party – the party of working people – we have a special responsibility to stand for a better politics.’

WHAT HE MEANT: Admits his initiative was prompted by the sensational allegations that union members were signed up as party members without their knowledge to influence the selection of a candidate in Falkirk. Until now, he has shown no desire to take on the union barons, to whom he owes his victory against brother David in the party leadership contest.

WHAT HE SAID: ‘We do not need to change that law on the right of trade unions to have political funds. But I do want to change the way individual trade unionists are affiliated to the Labour Party through these funds...‘Individual trade union members should choose to join Labour through the affiliation fee, not be automatically affiliated.’

WHAT HE MEANT: Plans for opt-in payment for union members would certainly deprive the party of some cash. But even though less money may go to it directly, subscription funds will be available for union leaders to distribute as they see fit – on anti-Conservative campaigns, or donations in the run-up to an election, for example. It will also mean union members who agree to pay the affiliation fee become party members. Len McCluskey estimates that at least 100,000 of his membership will sign up.

WHAT HE SAID: ‘I have asked Ray Collins, former general secretary of the Labour Party, to lead work on how to make this a reality.’

Unimpressed: Prime Minister David Cameron denounced Ed Miliband's plans as a smokescreen

WHAT HE MEANT: Lord Collins is the former assistant general secretary of the Transport and General Workers’ Union and in 2007 helped steer through a merger with Amicus to create the super-union Unite. Tories said the selection of a union man revealed Mr Miliband’s reform plan as a ‘stitch-up’.

WHAT HE SAID: ‘We will urgently agree new spending limits for Parliamentary selections to include for the first time all spending by outside organisations.’

WHAT HE MEANT: Argues a spending cap will limit ‘machine politics’ by unions when it comes to picking candidates. But there is no indication of what the limit will be. Crucially, there is no intention to change the leadership rules which means the unions control around a third of Labour’s electoral college

WHAT HE SAID: ‘Can it be right that the rules allow MPs to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds from private legal practice while they are supposed to be an MP, or from outside corporations without any real form of regulation?... At the very least there should be new limits on outside earnings.’

WHAT HE MEANT: A crude but effective attempt to turn some heat on the Tories. Before the last election, David Cameron persuaded the then shadow Cabinet to drop outside interests, but would face uproar if he tried the same with his MPs. 

WHAT HE SAID: ‘I propose for the next London Mayoral election Labour will have a primary for our candidate selection. Any Londoner should be eligible to vote and all they will need to do is to register as a supporter of the Labour Party at any time up to the ballot. Ray Collins will examine how to pioneer this idea elsewhere too, such as in future Parliamentary selections where a sitting MP is retiring and where the local party has dwindled.’

WHAT HE MEANT: American-style primaries have been pioneered by the Tories, who used them to select some of their candidates in 2010. Critics say the system gives extra power to those with backing from the media or deep pockets.
