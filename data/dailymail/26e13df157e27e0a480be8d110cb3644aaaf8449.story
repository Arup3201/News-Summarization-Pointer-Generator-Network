Amanda Berry gave birth to her six-year-old daughter in a small inflatable swimming pool while she was being held in captivity at the house of Ariel Castro, it emerged today.

Police sources confirmed today that chains, ropes and other bondage devices were found in the house on Seymour Avenue and that at least one of the girls was chained to the wall 'like a trophy'.

It also emerged today that Castro would sometimes sneak the women out of the house in disguises and multiple sources confirmed that Berry's daughter Jocelyn was taken out often to visit her 'grandma' and be home schooled.

A source with access to a police report told The Plain Dealer that while the women were chained and locked inside different rooms in the home, holes were cut in the doors to slide things like food in and out.

Another
police source told a local news station that what they found in the 
house confirms that the victims endured a decade of torture at the hands
of Castro.

Windows and doors of the house were 
boarded up and the back yard - where the girls were reportedly forced to
walk on all fours on leashes like dogs - was covered with an 
eight-foot-tall fence made out of chicken wire and blue tarpaulin.

It was also revealed that Castro 
would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run away by 
pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried to run 
free.

This is said to be just one of the 
manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house 
for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging
 from the ceiling.

Reporters
 from local station WOIO spoke to law enforcement sources who said that 
he would 'play this little dangerous game that he would tell the women 
he was about to leave the home, and then he would wait and if one of 
them tried to open that door, he would go in and attack them.'

'That was one of the ways he was able to keep them there,' reporter Dan Deroos told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

The
 trick clearly contributed to the young women's captivity, as Berry 
stressed the fact that she feared his quick return during her frantic 
911 call.

The hanging chains were also reportedly used during the first few years of captivity, along with frequent beatings.

'They were bound and gagged several times throughout the course of being held in that home,' WOIO reports.

Another
 psychological tactic that he used to keep the women in constant fear 
was the constant threat of violence, and threats to their childrens' 
lives.

In hindsight, there were signs of a 
darker side to Ariel Castro. Divorced years ago and never seen in the 
company of women, he suddenly started showing up in the largely 
Latino, working-class neighborhood with a little girl.

It was his girlfriend's child, he told neighbors.

The 52-year-old was believed to have 
lived alone, yet on his lunch break would bring home enough bags of fast
 food and beverages for several people.

He was a school bus driver given 
mostly 'excellent' marks on his performance appraisals, but was 
repeatedly disciplined, including for one incident when he was accused 
of calling a young student a 'bitch' and leaving a child alone on a bus.

He was fired last November.

Castro was arrested in 1993 after a domestic violence complaint, though a grand jury decided not to indict him.

Another complaint in 2005 filed by 
his ex-wife, who died last year at age 48, accused him of twice breaking
 her nose and attempting to abduct their daughters and keep them from 
her mother.

'Knocked out tooth. Dislocated 
shoulder (twice - one each side); threatened to kill petitioner and 
daughters 3/4 times just this year,' the petition, signed by Figueroa 
and her lawyer, said.

For years, Castro's neighbors on 
Seymour Avenue saw him as a friendly but private person, an accomplished
 musician who played bass in Latin bands such as Borin Plena and Grupo 
Fuego.

He liked motor-bikes and showed up at
 neighborhood barbecues in a vacant lot on Seymour Avenue. He was a 
self-taught mechanic who loved to talk about cars.

He owned an unremarkable, two-story 
house in a somewhat dilapidated part of Cleveland. Built in 1890, the 
home was valued at a mere $13,200 in 2011, according to property 
records. Its windows were covered to block views from the outside.

One childhood friend said a music session with Castro, who was born in Puerto Rico, suddenly turned bizarre.

'Ariel was in my garage probably five
 or six years ago. We were recording a song, an idea we had - a little 
hard rock with some Latin,' said Joe Popow, 45, a father of six who said
 he has known the Castro brothers since childhood.

'And - you're going to laugh - he 
said he was in the CIA. And I don't know if he was joking or not, but 
it's the way he said it, how serious he said it.

'I didn't know what he was capable of. That just put me on defense, and I just started stepping away,' Popow said.

While Berry is 
said to have birthed her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn during her 
captivity, police are reportedly looking for the bodies of other 
children who were miscarried or died due to malnutrition.

'Numerous
 times throughout this 10-year period, that some of the women became 
pregnant and that they would be beaten, forcibly hit in the stomach to 
force a miscarriage, if you can imagine that,' WOIO reporter Deroos told
 CNN. 

Jocelyn, like her mother, was 
said to be dehydrated and malnourished, but eventually given the 
all-clear by a local hospital following their rescue.

Other
 children are thought to have suffered a different fate, as cadaver dogs
 were brought to the house by investigators searching for the bodies of 
any other children.

The
 ongoing investigation of the house has led investigators to believe 
that while the girls were kept on the property by the boarded windows, 
padlocked doors, and chicken wire-laden fence, they may have been able 
to access multiple rooms inside the home.

Neighbors
 of Ariel Castro said that when police raided the three-storey property,
 they went straight upstairs and hauled the girls out.

At
 the top of the property at the back is a smashed window - thought to be
 the attic - which could have been broken in an attempt to attract 
attention to themselves or wriggle out to freedom.

MailOnline can also reveal that Ariel
 Castro, who owned the house and has been arrested along with his two 
brothers, turned it into a 'fortress' by setting up a stockade round the
 back.

He used chicken wire and blue 
tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes 
go overgrown so nobody could see in.

The
 house is now the center of an FBI investigation after Berry, 27, 
DeJesus, 23 and Knight, 30, were all found there after being missing for
 around ten years.

Neighbors
 said that Ariel Castro used to be seen very often at the property but 
in recent years had only been there a few times a week, to the extent 
that it was thought the property was vacant and that he was using it as 
an investment.

Meanwhile,
 Cleveland police allege, the three girls remained trapped inside, 
meaning they could have had to wait for days at a time to eat.

The
 back windows of the house are either boarded up or have the curtains 
drawn and even the large garage style building in the back garden has 
its windows covered.
