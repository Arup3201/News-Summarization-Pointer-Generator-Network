Giant striker Lacina Traore has been left out of the Ivory Coast squad for this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

Traore joined Everton on loan from Monaco last January but made just one start for the Toffees because of a hamstring problem.

The 23-year-old played for his country in a warm-up international against Bosnia in St. Louis on Friday but was taken off after an hour.
