Soldiers said a tearful goodbye to the families they will not see for nine months as they prepared to fly into battle in Afghanistan for the last time.

Troops from the 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, were surrounded by spouses, children, parents and siblings at the emotional send off yesterday.

Relatives joined 130 soldiers from the Brigade, known as the Vanguard, as they boarded buses to an airfield at Fort Stewart, Georgia.

Since 2003, the 3rd Infantry Division has been deployed numerous times in Afghanistan and Iraq, where 436 members of the Division were killed.

The troops are returning to Afghanistan for the final time as the U.S. prepares to withdraw its Armed Forces by next year.

It is likely to be the last mayor influx of U.S. troops into Afghanistan ahead of the withdrawal, which will come nearly 13 years after it led an invasion of the country.

The U.S. has lost more than 2,000 troops and intelligence operatives during the war - more than any other foriegn nation.

More than 2,200 troops from the 3rd Infantry Division are being sent to Afghanistan on a nine-month deployment.

It follows the soldiers' return from Iraq in June 2001, since when they have been preparing to head to Afghanistan, where they will primarily be training Afghan National Security Forces.

They will join more than 5,000 soldiers from the Division, nicknamed the Rock of Marne, already there.

Fort Stewart is home to a state-of-the-art Virtual Training Facility, which cost $8.2 million (£5.5m) and was completed in January.

It includes seven large simulators, each of which allow 10 soldiers at a time to practice marksmanship on 13 different simulated weapons, including .50-calibre machine guns and AT4 anti-tank missile launchers.

The U.S. Army is able to save millions in the cost of ammunition thanks to the facility, according to Savannah Morning News.

In its first 30 days of operation, an average of 400 soldiers a day used the simulators, including some from the 3rd Division.

The soldiers fired more than 566,000 virtual rounds, which on a traditional firing range would have cost more than $1.4 million (£930,000).
