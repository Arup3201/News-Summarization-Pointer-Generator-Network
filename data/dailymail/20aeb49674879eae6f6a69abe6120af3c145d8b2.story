A chef at a ritzy eatery in Brooklyn is accused of serving the worst meat to Asian patrons and demanding they were not seated near him.

A lawsuit alleges that César Ramirez of Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare ordered his staff to abide by his preferences and became angry if they did not. 

'When a large piece of meat was cut into many pieces for the guests, Defendant Ramirez instructed Ms. Howard to give the worst pieces of meat to the 's**t people,' i.e. Asian people, and to Upper West Siders,' the suit states.

The three-Michelin-star eatery, which accommodates 18 diners, charges a flat $255 per person plus a $50 'service charge' for each patron, reports the New York Post.

Ex-server Emi Howard, who is Asian, alleges in the suit Ramirez told his staff not to place Asian customers too close to him in his section of the restaurant.

'On one occasion, Ms. Howard 'violated' Defendant Ramirez's discriminatory rule by seating Asian individuals close to his spot at the center of kitchen counter,' the suit states.

'In response, Defendant Ramirez subjected Ms. Howard to a wild verbal tirade.'

'Mr. Ramirez from then on took control of the seating, so that he could ensure that no Asians be sat next to his place.'

Howard and four other former employees who were sacked, also accuse Ramirez and owner Moe Issa of cutting them out of tips and withholding overtime pay.  

Howard and fellow axed staffers Kyle McMahon, Loren Mash and Santos Hernandez are seeking unspecified back pay and damages.  

In a 2010 interview with Serious Eats: 'There are only a couple of feet between me and the customer, so I can't lie about the quality of the food or give them something inferior, like some restaurants do. 

'There is an intimacy that Brooklyn Fare provides, but this is my kitchen, and I want to do it my way.'

Brooklyn Fare owner Moe Issa has said in an email statement to The Daily Meal:  'At Brooklyn Fare, we pride ourselves on the diversity of our staff who hail from around the globe, and we welcome everyone who comes through our doors with open arms, be it a guest, vendor, or employee, regardless of their creed, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or nationality. We pay all of our staff fair wages for their hours worked as well as gratuity in accordance to the law.'
