Looking for some beach body inspiration to make sure you get noticed for the right reasons this summer?

Experts have created the 'perfect beach body' made up of the celebrity features voted 'most desirable' by Brits.

The 'perfect' female beach body is made up of Jessica Alba’s arms, Taylor Swift’s legs and the stomach of Geordie Shore’s Charlotte Crosby. 

Men, meanwhile, opted for Chris Hemsworth’s arms, Joe Manganiello’s abs and David Gandy’s legs.

First of all, the women taking part were asked ‘If you could describe the bikini body you’d most like to achieve, which celebrity’s body parts/features would you most want?’.

They   had to assign a celebrity’s name next to hair, arms, stomach, chest, legs and bottom.

When it came to hair, women love Kate Hudson's beachy blonde locks. They want to emulate Jessica Alba's arms, Geordie Shore slimmer Charlotte Crosby's stomach and Katy Perry's chest. 

British women believe that Taylor Swift has the best legs and Blurred Lines model Emily Ratajkowski has the most desirable derriere.

When the male respondents were asked the same, the results revealed that Hugh Jackman had the best hair, Chris Hemsworth had the best arms and  Joe Manganiello possessed the best abs and back.

When it came to the most desired chest, Twilight's Taylor Lautner took first place, while men reckon David Gandy has the perfect legs.

And it seems that Brits are rushing to emulate their celebrity idols, with 62 per cent of respondents saying they're changing their eating habits before a holiday and half increasing the amount of exercise they're doing.

A spokesperson for sunshine.co.uk, who created the images, said: 'We thought we’d have a bit of fun to see what this year’s dream celebrity beach bodies were looking like. 

'Men and women alike clearly have a set idea of the body they aspire to have, but there’s a lot of work and commitment that’s need to go into that plan if these pictures are anything to go by. 

'What people need to remember is that celebrities often have personal training sessions every day and that it’s OK if you don’t look like a top model or weightlifter!'.
