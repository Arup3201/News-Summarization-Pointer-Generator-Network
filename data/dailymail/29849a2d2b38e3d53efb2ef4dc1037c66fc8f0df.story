Keane told Sir Alex Ferguson 'we need f****** more from you' in furious row that led to Irishman leaving Manchester United

Keane says he wouldn't have missed a drugs test like Rio Ferdinand and Manchester United suffered as a result

Roy Keane has revealed the astonishing details of a fight with Peter Schmeichel that left the Great Dane with a black eye.

The Manchester United legends came to blows during a pre-season tour of Asia.

Keane's new autobiography The Second Half, published this week lays bare the scrap - which saw legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson brand the Old Trafford icons 'a disgrace to the club.'

Roy Keane

Height: 5ft 10in

Age: 43

Biggest clash: Gained revenge on Alf-Inge Haaland with a horror tackle on the Manchester City man in 2001.

Peter Schmeichel

Height: 6ft 3in

Age: 50

Biggest clash: Was accused of using racist language towards Arsenal's Ian Wright after scuffling with him in the tunnel following a two-footed lunge by the striker in 1997.

'I had a bust-up with Peter when we were on a pre-season tour of Asia, in 1998 (actually in 1997), just after I came back from my cruciate injury. I think we were in Hong Kong. There was drink involved,' wrote Keane in an extract serialised in the Daily Mirror.

Keane revealed he often didn't see eye-to-eye with the former United keeper over his on-field conduct, with Schmeichel famed for shouting at his defenders.

Keane continued by describing the morning afterwards: 'The manager had a go at us as we were getting on the bus, and people were going on about a fight in the hotel the night before. It started coming back to me - the fight between me and Peter.

'In the meantime, Nicky Butt had been filling me in on what had happened the night before. Butty had refereed the fight. Anyway, Peter had grabbed me, I'd head-butted him - we'd been fighting for ages. 

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'

As well as being Aston Villa's assistant manager, Keane is No 2 to Martin O'Neill with the Republic of Ireland

Appearances: 366

Goals: 39

Assists: 33

Yellow cards: 69

Red cards: 7 

Honours: Premier League title (seven), FA Cup (four), Champions League (one)

'At the press conference, Peter took his sunglasses off. He had a black eye. The questions came at him "Peter, what happened to your eye?"

'[Schmeichel] said, "I just got an elbow last night, in training". And that was the end of it.'

Keane bizarrely goes on to say that Sir Bobby Charlton, who at the time would have been 60, could have split up the two Premier League hard men after being woken up by the warring pair.

However, the Irishman did praise Schmeichel for taking responsibility for the scrap, adding that he 'admired' the goalkeeper.

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'
