He might not technically be a bloodhound but Riley the dog is believed to be one of the leading blood donors in the US.

Riley, an eight-year old crossbreed has been helping save the lives of hundreds of dogs for more than seven years.

He was signed up for his local blood donation program at the age of one and has been ever present since.

The dog donates every six weeks - the recommended time frame by vets - meaning he has donated the maximum amount of blood possible and saved more than 200 dogs' lives.

With America's canine blood banks currently experiencing a shortage in supplies, more dogs like Riley are desperately needed, especially as he is close to retirement.

Dogs will usually donate between 230cc and 430cc of blood, which, if they donate as regularly possible for the seven year donation period, means they can save between 112 and 224 lives.

Given Riley's age, size and the frequency of his visits, it is believed he is one of the most prolific blood donating dogs in the country, with the biggest donor unknown.

Jocelyn Pratt, from the Blue Ridge Veterinary Blood Bank in Virginia, where Riley's blood is sent, estimates he has saved around 224 lives and counting.

His owner, Deanna Wilson, 33, from Dunkirk in Maryland, USA, said: 'The first visit he spent in my lap - he was just a little unsure about what was going on and they just took a small sample for testing.

'Ever since then he has been fine and happily follows the vet out to the room.

'When he thinks we're going to donate he starts barking in the car close to the vet office in excitement.

'He actually pulls me into the donation room and jumps right up on the table. If he has to wait for another dog to finish, he'll bark to let them know he's ready for his turn.

She added: 'We think Riley can donate for another year - probably until he turns 9. We're so proud to think of all the other dogs he has been able to give a longer life to.'

Dogs can replenish their blood in about three weeks so vet Jocelyn has dogs donate once every five to seven weeks to make it convenient for their owners.

She said: 'Our schedule changes - sometimes it's seasonal, sometimes it relates to nationwide disasters.

'We travel to up to seven donor sites a week and try to schedule between 15-20 dogs per site but most often we end up with less.

'There is no way to predict what we will need or what we will collect which is why it's important to have committed donors and their owners like Riley and Deanna in our program.

'A dog like Riley who has been an awesome donor for seven years and given at the consistent frequency of every six weeks could have saved between 112-224 dogs had all of their components been used already.

'Some of the components have a longer shelf life so the plasma could potentially be sitting in a vet's freezer waiting for a potential emergency.

'All of the red cells must be used within a 42 day period so those would have been used already.'
