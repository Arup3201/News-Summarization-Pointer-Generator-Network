A 26-year-old man decided there was more to life and gave up everything so he could travel the world in a converted van.

Bored with his conventional life in the UK, systems engineer Mike Hudson, 26, has spent 300 days travelling 10,000 miles in a £2,500 LDV Convoy van.

The adventurer, from Sheffield, converted the vehicle into his very own 'studio apartment' complete with bedroom-lounge-diner, walk in shower room, 200-watt solar power system, fridge and gas cooker.

Mike Hudson has already travelled some 10,000 miles after starting a new chapter of his life in his van

The 26-year-old decided to leave Sheffield and travel the world, and right, he earns money fire-juggling

Mike spent four-months refitting the van and set off from his home city to live in some of Europe's most striking wildernesses and cities.

He worked in an office during the day while learning to build websites and researching how to refit his van in his evenings.

Mike explained how he reached the decision to make such a dramatic change in lifestyle.

'I lived in Sheffield and I really love that city,' he said.

'I have loads of great friends in England and I had my own place which rented with a friend, a car and a good job.

'Looking back though, I was quite miserable the year before travelling. I felt a bit trapped, and I had a feeling of - is this it? This can't be it.

'I wanted something different - adventure, experience and challenge. I was bored, and living on the road was a daydream I couldn't get rid of.

'I was lucky everyone there was really cool when I told them my plans to leave the UK and travel the world in my truck.

'I was nervous, scared, excited and relieved because I knew there was no going back. It's a bit of a life experiment.'

Mr Hudson paid £2,500 for the LDV van, and spent a fair amount of time making it into his 'home'

There is space in the back of the van now to dine, relax and then sleep, with a nice wood finish

Mike, who left the UK in March last year and is currently in the paradise Greek island of Santorini, managed to scrape together £4,500 to finance his new life.

He now survives on a daily budget of just ten-pounds per day by diesel sharing with hitchhikers, generating money from his online blog and juggling fire as a street performer.

Highlights of Mike's journey include crossing the incredible Transfagersan pass in Romania, taking part in Hungary's SUN music festival and spotting brown bears in the forest.

'In Slovakia, I did a three-point turn in a narrow mountain road and the back wheels slipped off the edge of the crumbling road.

This is how Mr Hudson's home started - more akin to a painter and decorator's pack-up than a home

Mr Hudson spent four months preparing the van for the next journey of his life

'My foot was pressing so hard on the brake, there was fluid leaking onto the road, I couldn't let go because I'd go off the road down the hill, backwards.

'My van is rear wheel drive so I had to be towed out.

'I really didn't think I'd get out of that situation.'

So far Mike has travelled from England to France, Spain and Portugal, then he travelled east to Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria to eventually reach Greece.

Mr Hudson has ensured he can dine with a little bit of style, despite eating out of the back of a £2,500 van

There was even enough room to fit a toilet into the van, and right, a general view from the back

Despite the drama of life on the road, Mike explained why he has no firm plans to return home at the moment.

'I like England, but the winter and lack of light kills me - plus it's too cold to live in a van during winter,' he said.

'I want to look back when I'm older and think - yes I was living, and I made the most I could out of life.

'I describe everything in my blog and whether this gives people a kick in the right direction to follow their dreams, or helps them in some way with van conversions or travel then I'm happy.

'Eventually, I want my website to be a resource for anyone who wants to convert a van into their home with minimal skills and tools, as well as guides for living and travelling in a van.

'This is a great way to travel and live.'
