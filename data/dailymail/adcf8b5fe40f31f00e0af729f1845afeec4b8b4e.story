Tragic death: Nayvem Santos, 2, died after falling out of the window of his family's apartment

A 2-year-old boy fell and later died on Sunday after crawling out the window of his family's New York apartment.

Police say Nayvem Santos, 2, fell to a second-floor landing from the seventh floor of a Gerard Avenue building in the Bronx on Sunday night while his grandmother slept in the other room.

'My son! My son!' cried Eduardo 
Santos,the father of adorable 2-year-old, after finding his son’s body 
on a second-floor landing below, a neighbor told The New York Post.

Police say the child was unconscious and
 unresponsive when officers arrived; he was pronounced dead a short time
 later at Lincoln Hospital.

Nayvem Santos, 2, was in his family's kitchen when he climbed a chair to reach the window and fell out.

The window had a lower metal guard on it, but the window was open all the way, leaving room at the top for him to fall out.

The 2-year-old was being watched by his grandmother while his parents were out for the night.

Pix 11 reports that the parents noticed their child missing from his crib and then discovered his body outside.

A police spokesman says the toddler’s death appears to be an 'unfortunate accident’ and says the boy lived in the apartment building, located about four blocks from Yankee Stadium.

As his grandmother slept in another room, Nayvem fell from the sixth floor window and landed on the roof of the building's south Entrance.

'His parents went out last night and left him with the grandma,' said Jimmy Cruz, a neighbour to The New York Daily News.

Neighbors told reporters that the boy's grandmother lived in the same apartment as the boy and his parents.

They family are being questioned by police.

The New York Daily News reports that a light-colored baby blanket was still stuck to the buildings brick wall a few stories down hours after the fall.

Neighbors describe the 2-year-old as being a happy, sweet kid and a basketball lover.

He was a sweet kid, he had a lot of energy,' said neighbor Peter Philip.

'He was a very happy kid and smart, too. He was very smart for a 2-year-old. You’d always see him walking around the neighborhood holding his dad’s hand. And he always had a basketball in his hands,' said another neighbor, Eric Phillip, 33.

The boy was rushed to the hospital where he later died of his injuries.

An investigation is ongoing.
