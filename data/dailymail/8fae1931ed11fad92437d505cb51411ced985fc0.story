Grandmother Joyce Moore, 83, died of carbon monoxide poisoning after a botched insulation job

A grandmother who died of carbon monoxide poisoning after a botched insulation job might as well have been ‘murdered by an intruder’, a judge said.

Joyce Moore’s son had been cold-called by a firm offering to carry out the work for free.

But employees installing the insulation blocked the 83-year-old’s boiler flue and did not tell her or son Bob, 61, that it was unsafe.

As he turned the heating on that night, the house filled with poisonous gas.

On Friday a judge slammed HIS Energy – run by multimillionaire Neville Wilshire, star of fly-on-the-wall BBC series The Call Centre – as ‘second-rate’. 

Fining the firm £500,000 for health and safety breaches, he added that accountant Mr Moore was ‘as much a victim of this as if his mother had been murdered by an intruder’.

But it was unclear yesterday how much of the fine would be paid as the business went into liquidation within weeks of the prosecution being launched.

Last night, Mr Moore said he felt Mr Wilshire was responsible for his mother’s death.

Months after the widow died, another of the entrepreneur’s firms was fined £225,000, for ringing homes that had opted out of cold-calls.

Mrs Moore, a retired pub landlady who had recently visited her grandchildren in Australia, lived with her son at his £250,000 detached home in Middleton, Greater Manchester.

In September 2012, he was cold-called by an agent for Mr Wilshire’s Nationwide Energy Services Ltd. Mr Moore agreed to an offer of free home insulation in a Government-backed scheme to cut carbon emissions.

Within weeks, three workmen from HIS Energy came round to insulate the loft and pump insulation beads into the wall cavities. But some of the beads blocked the boiler chimney, a well-known risk from the process, Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard.

The jury was told the supervisor called his head office, but the manager responsible for safety had gone home, and a colleague decided it could wait until the next day. The workers failed to notify a gas engineer or tell Mr Moore the boiler was unsafe, saying they would return in the morning to finish the job.

Mr Moore told the Daily Mail: ‘As the last one was walking back to their van, he said, “I wouldn’t put your central heating on tonight”. I asked “Why not?”, and he just said, “It doesn’t really matter, it’s in the garage and it’s well-ventilated”.’

A judge branded HIS Energy – run by multimillionaire Neville Wilshire, star of fly-on-the-wall BBC series The Call Centre – as ‘second-rate’

When Mr Moore put the heating on that evening, his mother was upstairs. He said: ‘Next thing I notice, I’m starting to get a bit groggy. I opened the back door then went upstairs … my mum was dead.’

Mr Moore rang 999. He and two paramedics suffered carbon monoxide poisoning. The trial was told HIS Energy, which did not offer a defence, failed to mention carbon monoxide in its risk assessment policy for workmen or supply warning labels to mark appliances as unsafe.

Recorder Charles Garside, QC, said the firm had used ‘smoke and mirrors’ to hide how it was organised, adding: ‘No fine I can impose will compensate for his mother’s death … or undo the harm that was done. All his effort to keep her in comfort in old age was destroyed by this incident.’

HIS Energy was put into liquidation three weeks after the prosecution was instigated, so the fine is likely to be paid by its insurers.
