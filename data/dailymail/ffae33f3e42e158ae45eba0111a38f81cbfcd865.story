Former baseball star Jose Canseco's model daughter got busted for a DUI in the heart of Hollywood early Monday morning.

Eighteen-year-old Josie Canseco was pulled over about 1am after police officers saw her hit a curb with her car. 

She had to do a series of sobriety tests, which she failed, and was subsequently arrested, police said.

Police don't believe, however, that Canseco was under the influence of alcohol, but believe she could have been under the influence of drugs, sources told TMZ.  

She was booked at about 6.15am and was held on a $15,000 bail. 

Josie's father Jose had his own run-in with drugs when he was accused of using steroids when the slugger played Major League Baseball.

He admitted to using steroids and in a 2005 book he opened up about the widespread use of the drug in the MLB.
