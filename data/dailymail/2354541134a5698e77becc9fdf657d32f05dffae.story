Sacha Boren Cohen aims to causes outrage in his spoof films, and now his latest blockbuster is so controversial, it has been banned from a whole country.

Tajikistan have decided not to screen his latest offering, The Dictator, after authorities ruled that the movie was incompatible with the nation's 'mentality.'

The film, which features Baron Cohen as General Aladeen, depicts a fictional Middle Eastern dictator risking his life to crush signs of democracy,  has been refused a distribution licence.

'It's wrong to compare us with Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and with other countries,' said Daler Davlatov of the Tatan distribution company in Tajikistan.

'It's incorrect because we have a different mentality. We're not going to give Dictator a premiere because of these considerations," he told the Kyrgyz news website kloop.kg.

Tajikistan's distributor of international movies, Tantana, said it would instead encourage people to watch Will Smith's Men in Black 3, the Central Asian News Service reported yesterday.

Baron Cohen has already denied the role was an attack on Arabs and said the onlpeople who would be offended by it would be 'dictators and fans of dictatorship.'

It's not the first time Baron Cohen has had his work censored - in 2006 Russia banned his hit comedy film, Borat, which had been accused of poking fun at Moscow's neighbour and close ally Kazakhstan.

Tajikistan is an ex-Soviet state ruled by President Emomalii Rahmon since 1992.

A rugged, mountainous country, it is Central Asia's poorest nation.

One Tajik political scientist, Muso Asozoda, forecast the ban would be similarly counterproductive as the Borat ban.

The fact that two cineam's in Dushanbe , the capital and largest city of Tajikistan were not screening the film would add viewer interest, he told the Guardian newspaper.

This week the comic claimed he was banned from shooting scenes for his new film The Dictator at the United Nations because it might upset real-life despots.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The interesting thing is, when we asked to shoot inside the United Nations, they actually refused.

'We said 'this is a pro-democracy movie'. They said 'that's the problem - we represent a lot of dictators, and they are going to be very angry by this portrayal of them so you can't shoot in there".'

This week Sacha Baron Cohen continued his array of stunts to promote the film by arriving at the 65th Cannes Film Festival in a bright orange Lamborghini.

The 40-year-old actor was in full character as General Aladeen and was once again surrounded by an array of beautiful women who were dressed as his bodyguards.

Wearing a blue denim-looking jumpsuit that was covered in badges and images of the character, Cohen kept a cigar hanging from his mouth at all times and played up to the camera as he kept a close eye on his female friends - in particular model Sasha Volkova who wore a black dress.

He completed his look with a pair of snakeskin boots and some blue-tinted sunglasses as he strolled around outside the French venue.

He then made his way over to another lady and enjoyed a quick kiss as he filmed a slot for the Le Grand Journal TV show.
