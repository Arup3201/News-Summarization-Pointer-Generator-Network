A French lorry driver has been caught on Britain’s busiest motorway having a Skype conversation.

Police pulled over the 35-year-old motorist after filming him holding the webcam chat with a computer on his dashboard as he drove along the M25 last night near Thorpe, Surrey.

Officers received a call at about 9.15pm from a motorist who reported seeing the lorry driver, apparently watching television while he was driving at Junction 12.

Caught: Police pulled over the motorist after filming him on Skype as he drove along the M25 in Surrey

The lorry, which had French plates, 
was stopped at Junction 14 near London Heathrow Airport, where 
Surrey Police officers discovered that the driver had been using Skype.

The
 driver was ordered to pay a roadside deposit fine of £500 towards the 
prosecution costs and will be reported for summons for driving without 
due care and attention.

Roads
 policing officer PC Dan Pascoe, who stopped the driver, said: ‘We have 
no power to seize the vehicle and the roadside deposit negated the need 
to arrest the driver.

‘Once
 he had paid the fine he was allowed on his way. He was also reported 
for summons to appear in court at a later date and if he does not appear
 then he will not get his deposit back.’

'Would you believe it!': The image was posted on the Twitter page of Surrey Roads Police yesterday evening

The
 image was posted on the Twitter page of Surrey Roads Police yesterday, 
with the caption: ‘Would you believe it, this foreign lorry driver was 
having a Skype call whilst driving along the M25!’

Officers said that the image was a still taken from their in-car video which will be used in evidence.

Police
 in Britain can issue fixed penalties and request a financial penalty 
deposit from foreign residents without an address in the UK.

These
 payments can act as a form of surety in respect of a fine where an 
offence will be prosecuted in court. Alleged offenders can choose to 
contest the offence in court if they wish.

The
 M25 around London is known as the busiest road in Britain - 
specifically the section between junctions 14 and 15, from the A3133 at 
Heathrow to the M4, which carries 165,000 vehicles per day.
