Caroline struggled to find just eight models that were healthy enough to appear in her show

It should have been the proudest moment of my year.

Yet as I watched eight models wearing my designs stride down the spotlight-studded catwalk at the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge on Tuesday – the final day of London Fashion Week – I was troubled by a dark and deeply disturbing memory.

Just three weeks earlier, I had held my first casting session – and almost every girl who attended was devastatingly thin and looked severely malnourished. 

It was the first time in my 22 years as a fashion designer that I had struggled to find just eight models who looked healthy and shapely enough to appear in my annual catwalk show.

The parade of jutting spines, protruding hipbones, flat chests and wasted muscles on casting day was achingly sad. One girl was so determined to win a space on my catwalk that she layered on three pairs of tights in a desperate attempt to make her legs appear less stick-like. 

Many of the girls wore heavily-padded bras, some with fillets inserted, to give the semblance of shape to their flat chests – though they were quickly found out as I measure the models in their underwear to check that their actual measurements tally with what they claim.

Yet even more disturbing are the legions of girls who don’t try to disguise their skeletal frames at all. Why? Because they believe that this is what the fashion world expects of them. 

And then came the final straw. I was utterly flabbergasted when my slim and beautiful 15-year-old daughter Annabelle turned to me and said, ‘I’m going on a diet, Mum because I want to be a model.’

What’s concerning is that Annabelle, like many girls her age, believes that the models are the essence of glamour.

It worries me sick, the idea that she would get eating disorders or not eat correctly with the desire to be this size and look as stick thin as her idols.

In reality, I ask modelling agencies to only send girls to castings if they meet my strict criteria: They must be a healthy-looking girl of 23 to 26 years old. She should measure 5ft9 in height but above all, she must be no smaller than a size 9. In other words, a small size 10. 

Usually, it takes two casting sessions to find eight suitable models who fit this criteria. Yet this year, I found only two suitable models in my first session – and none at all in my second casting session.

Quite simply, they were all too thin. 

Panic stricken, I called a third casting session. Then a fourth, and a fifth.

By Monday – just one day before the show – I was still scrambling around to find an eighth girl.

Finally, a beautiful girl walked in whom I was determined to book. She had olive skin, blue eyes, she was very pretty and had a lovely toned figure with a 26-inch waist. ‘You’ve got a fabulous figure, you’re perfect. This is great,’ I told her. But her reply was shattering. 

She admitted, ‘I visited a modelling agency a few days ago and asked them to represent me. They told me they would only accept me if I lost five kilos.’

In truth, she didn’t need to lose a pound. Had she done so, she would have looked awful. I asked what she had said to the agency and was relieved to learn that she had told them their agency wasn’t for her. 

But for every one of her, there are fifty models who would buckle under the pressure and instantly shed the kilos, desperate to find work in this increasingly-crowded industry.

Though models have always been considered thin, there is now an unhealthy and unspoken requirement that they must be a minuscule UK size 2, 4 or 6. In other words, stick thin twiglets with no breasts, no hips, very little waistline and certainly no womanly shape. 

As recently as two years ago, this wasn’t the case. In my 2011 catwalk show, I hired the most fabulous-looking girl with a gorgeous size-9 shape. I didn’t bother asking her to a casting session in 2012 and booked her again without seeing her. Yet when she arrived, I was horrified. 

In one year, she had shrunk from shapely to emaciated. Her knees were knobbly bones and her legs were the thickness of my arms. In total, she had lost two and a half stone. Why did she do it?

Because her agent advised it would allow her more work.

Caroline said that womanly models, like Miranda Kerr, pictured, were rare in modern fashion

What’s ironic is that beautiful as she is, I have never employed her since. Because the clothes were dropping off her, we have to pull them to pieces and refit them. My parting warning to her was: Don’t let this industry ruin you. 

Cara Delevigne, Karlie Kloss, Jourdan Dunn and the it-models of today have vastly different shapes to the shapely supermodels of the Eighties, when Elle Macpherson, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer graced the pages of Vogue – and when I launched my first fashion line. 

Named Survival Kit, it was a range of active sportswear stocked in Macy’s, Bloomingdales and Saks and never once was it difficult to cast an advertising shoot as there was an abundance of exercised, toned, healthy-looking models at that time. This was still the case in 1991 when I opened my first boutique selling couture bridal gowns and evening dresses in Esher, Surrey. 

Kate Moss pioneered the waif look in the 1990's

Even by 1995, as I collaborated with Jasper Conran on a line of bridal gowns, there was still no shortage of women fitting this criteria. Yet today, womanly-looking models such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Miranda Kerr are rarities, outnumbered by the masses of bone-thin girls.

What’s changed isn’t just down to fashion or the era of  waif look, paved by Kate Moss in the mid-1990s. In fact, the entire culture of modelling has altered and with it, the model’s shapes.

First, this is because models travel all the time: Whilst in the Eighties most girls working in Britain were British, today very few are. Models drop into New York for one month, to Germany for another, and many hail from Eastern Europe. Such a transient and highly-stressful lifestyle leaves little time for exercise and muscle-toning, and so thinness is instead attained by food – or lack thereof. 

Fashion designers also play a part: Many find it far easier to cast ‘coathanger’ models in their runway shows. Because they ‘hang’ clothes instead of wearing them, they don’t require as many time-consuming fittings and redesigns.

This is perhaps why the average model who walked at London Fashion Week was barely size 2 to 4. She likely had a 22-inch waist, a size 31 bust, no hips – which is very, very small for a 5ft9 woman. 

Amazing measures are being taken in Israel – models with a BMI of less than 18.5 have been banned. This shouldn’t just be celebrated, it should be common sense. 

Anything less is dangerous, and designers should have a duty of care to encourage models – their employees – to be slim rather than skinny, fit, well-toned, with great muscles and an aura of healthiness. In short, to be woman. 

Which is a vastly more attractive sight than a miserable, malnourished and emaciated teenage waif.
