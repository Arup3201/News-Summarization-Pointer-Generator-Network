So close: Anni, on the left, with her cousin and best friend Sneha Hindochna - who was in daily contact with Anni throughout the honeymoon

The woman who holds the key to the secrets of Anni Dewani’s turbulent relationship with her husband told police she believed he was lying about the sequence of events surrounding her murder.

Sneha Hindocha, Anni’s cousin and best friend, said she was suspicious of millionaire businessman Shrien Dewani’s claim that his bride wanted to visit a township in South Africa late at night on their honeymoon.

In a sensational witness statement, Sneha – who was in daily contact with Anni throughout the honeymoon – insisted Anni thought the wedding was a sham and Dewani was controlling and refused to have sex.

At the opening of his murder trial last week, Dewani, 34, denied having his wife – who was found dead in a black cocktail dress and diamante-encrusted high heels – shot in a staged carjacking in Cape Town four years ago. Sneha’s testimony forms the mainstay of the prosecution case. In her statement, seen by The Mail on Sunday, Sneha, 30, claims that:

A year apart in age, strikingly similar in looks, Anni and Sneha, who last week flew to Cape Town where she will give evidence at the trial, grew up together and shared a flat at university.

Both were close to their siblings but the bond between the two women ran deeper than any other in their lives. ‘I knew absolutely everything, no matter how intimate or private, about Anni and she in turn knew absolutely everything about me,’ said Sneha. ‘We shared things that no other person knew or knows about.’

While upset by Dewani’s personal criticisms, it was, claimed Sneha, the lack of intimacy in their 18-month relationship that troubled Anni most. ‘She told me she had tried to be intimate but Dewani had pushed her away,’ said Sneha. ‘Anni felt embarrassed and hurt by his reaction and we felt it was weird.’

Two weeks later, while staying at Stockholm’s Hilton Hotel, he was similarly distant, leaving Anni and her cousin to conclude ‘maybe he was a virgin’ or being ‘proper’ and not wanting sex before marriage.

Dewani offered an explanation later. He said he was tired from ‘hormone treatment for his infertility’. This revelation, according to Sneha, prompted Anni to break off the relationship ‘because she wanted to have children in the future but also because she did not want to be pushed away from intimacy’.

Following assurances from Dewani that his treatment was now working, the couple got back together in January 2010. ‘In other words he could have children and that his now raised hormone levels would allow him to be intimate,’ said Sneha.

Around this time Anni and Sneha moved to Britain from their native Sweden and shared a flat in Luton, Bedfordshire. For a while Anni’s relationship with Dewani improved but it deteriorated after he ‘travelled alone to Thailand to complete a Thai boxing course which he claimed would raise his hormone level’ apparently further.

What neither Anni nor Sneha suspected at this stage was that Shrien’s sexual interests often lay elsewhere.

Acting: Anni's cousin Sneha claims that Anni told her that the couple were ‘acting’ all the way through their wedding ceremony, pictured above. She also claims Dewani told his bride that her sari was not 'proper'

In a dramatic opening to his long-awaited trial, Dewani pleaded his innocence but revealed he is bisexual and saw male prostitutes. It was designed to pre-empt the forthcoming appearance of Leopold Leisser, a male prostitute who claims Dewani paid him £400 a session for sex.

In court he came face to face with the man he allegedly hired to murder his wife for the first time since the night of the shooting. Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 29, is one of two prosecution witnesses who have claimed that Dewani paid them to kill Anni.

Dewani denied any involvement in the murder of his 28-year-old wife, who died from a gunshot wound to the neck in a rough township of Cape Town in November 2010.

And he said, despite visiting male prostitutes, he was still attracted to Anni and had no reason to kill her. Throughout the spring and summer of 2010 their relationship, according to Sneha’s statement, was characterised by arguments.

‘During this time Anni told me through daily text messages, telephone calls and emails that she was not comfortable with Dewani,’ said Sneha.

And in May that year, she claims, Anni was effectively ambushed into an engagement. The statement says: ‘Anni’s parents came to the UK for a visit with the intention of Anni introducing them to Dewani’s family.’

The families met and ‘the following morning Dewani’s sister-in-law Kripa came down the stairs holding a silver tray with a holy relic to bless the relationship. This came as a complete surprise to Anni, her parents and me because Anni’s parents explained that this blessing is a sign of an engagement which they were not expecting.’

According to Sneha, her cousin was ‘aware that she had about a week’ before the engagement was due to be officially announced on May 27. Two days before, she sent Dewani an email, which Sneha helped compose, calling off the engagement. But Dewani urged her to reconsider, professed his love and ‘promised to change his ways’. The engagement went ahead.

In the statement, Sneha said Dewani ‘was always very controlling and very critical of Anni’s appearance’. Once he called Sneha to ask her to help him buy clothes for Anni ‘because he wanted to change, as he said, “the ugly duckling into a swan before the engagement”.’

Further emails from July 2010 describe more doubts, yet the wedding preparations continued apace. Sneha said: ‘During this time Anni sent me disturbing text messages explaining that there was a huge amount of animosity between them.’

It resulted, said the statement, in Anni ‘throwing her engagement ring at Dewani... Anni explained her sadness at the fact they were fighting all the time and not sharing a bed... as he chose to sleep on the sofa.’

But once again, they got back together, and the wedding, due to last two days, was set for October 27.

‘After the first ceremony, Anni returned to our hotel room and I noticed she was upset,’ said Sneha. ‘I asked what was bothering her. She replied by asking me if I thought she looked beautiful because... Dewani’s first words to Anni as she approached him on the red carpet was “Your sari is not proper”.’

Later, while helping Anni with her make-up, Sneha says her cousin asked ‘if we looked in love’.

Sneha goes on: ‘I then asked, “Why would you ask me that?” and Anni replied that she and Dewani had agreed to “act out the rest of the wedding ceremonies”.’

Doubts: Within days of the wedding Anni was talking again of leaving Dewani ‘and asked me to help her’, claimed Sneha

Within days of the wedding Anni was talking again of leaving Dewani ‘and asked me to help her’, claimed Sneha. Then Anni found out she was going to South Africa on honeymoon. Sneha said: ‘Anni was calling me on a daily basis explaining she did not want to go anywhere with Dewani, to South Africa or anywhere else, as she wanted a divorce.

‘...She also said they were not legally married as they had not had the registry marriage in the UK.’

The last time Sneha saw her cousin was on November 7 ‘when Anni, Dewani and others met up and went out to dinner so that I could introduce them to my boyfriend. The mood was very tense as Dewani was criticising Anni about her hair colour.’

The following day they left on honeymoon and five days later Sneha was told her cousin had been murdered. ‘Dewani called me, crying, as I was, so I can’t really remember much about this call.’

In court last week Dewani pleaded not guilty to five charges, including murder, kidnapping and robbery, conspiracy to commit all three, and obstructing the adminstration of justice. The trial is expected to last at least two months.
