The world's most popular property board game is set for a revolutionary change. 

For the first time, fans will be given the power to decide which 20 cities around the world host featured property spaces for the 80th anniversary World Edition game, launching in Autumn. 

While the game will have a global feel, the iconic first cities featured on the board - London for Commonwealth countries and Atlantic City for the US - could well disappear from the anniversary edition.  

Hasbro have launched a vote to decide upon countries to be featured in the 80th anniversary world edition, launched in August. Fans can cast their say at http://www.buzzfeed.com/votemonopoly

Many will associate Monopoly with London places such as the coveted May Fair and Park Lane, but London may not be featured at all on the anniversary World Edition, if it slips any lower

Out of the 80 global destinations up for grabs, London has slipped to 20th position, and is set to fall of the board.

The company behind the game, Hasbro, has announced the competition called Monopoly Here & Now and is asking fans to vote for which cities should be included.

Participants have until midnight on Wednesday 4 March to rally behind their  favourite cities for the coveted Mayfair and Park Lane spots.

The shortlist of cities who have made the winning board will be revealed on March 19, the Monopoly brand's official birthday.

The rules will vary slightly from the traditional version, which has been played by more than one billion people in 114 countries around the world.

Competitors will race round the board, and visit as many locations as possible, collected passport stamps along the way. Players will collect cash from visitor fees when opponents land on their locations and the first player to fill their passport wins.

Fans should not look out for the boot, iron and dog movers, as these will be replaced by famous landmarks from around the world.

Since it was released, the world famous tycoon game has been played in 114 countries around the world

Subtitled 'The Fast-Dealing Property Trading Game’, it is named after the economic concept of monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity.

It is produced by the US game and toy company Hasbro.

Players move around the gameboard buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels, and collecting rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy.

The longest MONOPOLY game in history lasted for 70 straight days. 

The most expensive version of the game was produced by celebrated San Francisco jeweller Sidney Mobell. Valued at $2 million, the set features a 23-carat gold board and diamond-studded dice.

More than six billion little green houses and 2.25 billion red hotels have been 'constructed' since 1935.

Since 1935, more than one billion people have played the game.

The traditional Monopoly gameboard consists of 40 spaces containing 28 properties (22 coloured streets, four railway stations and two utilities), three Chance spaces, three Community Chest spaces, a Luxury Tax space, an Income Tax space, and the four corner squares: GO, In Jail/Just Visiting, Free Parking, and Go to Jail.

The board game is loved by people all of the world, including Cindy Crawford (right), and has been played over one billion times
