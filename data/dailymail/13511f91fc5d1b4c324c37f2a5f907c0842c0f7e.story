An innocent Easter egg hunt took a horrific turn when a mother followed a foul smell coming form under her house - and found a rotting corpse.

Tara Hanouskova, from Knoxville, Tennessee, was hunting for chocolate eggs in her back garden with her four-year-old son when she was struck by the odour.

She had noticed a smell earlier in the week that seemed to be getting progressively worse, but had been unable to pinpoint the source until that moment.

She told WNCT that the smell had been neither consistent nor strong, and until that day had not been so bad she'd been compelled to find the source.

'I really don't even know how he got there,' she said.

Luckily, she was able to get her special needs son back in the house before he saw anything traumatic.

911 dispatchers even notified police and fire that this was a sensitive situation, and emergency responders were careful not to use sirens or lights.

'They were very respectful; they tread lightly,' Hanouskova told reporters. 'My son has no idea what happened.'

As Hanouskova's son is a special-needs child, responders were careful not to use lights or sirens, and called as little attention as possible to what was happening

Tests 
later revealed that the body of a middle-aged man had been there for 
around two weeks.

According to the WBIR TV station, the fateful easter egg hunt took place on Wednesday evening, with the rotting body being found at around 7.20pm.

The body was so badly decomposed that it could not be immediately identified. Police said that the man was carrying no identification, and that it was impossible to take fingerprints at the scene.

The 5'4" man had no scars of tattoos and weighed some 170 pounds. He had brown hair and brown eyes.

It also emerged that a gardener who visited the house to cut the grass - who was even asked to investigate the smell - also failed to track down the body.

The body was reportedly found underneath decking, which was large and close to the ground. The corpse was around 20 feet from the outer edge of the dark and narrow space underneath.

Preliminary autopsy results have led police to believe the man died of a medical condition, but they are waiting for confirmation before describing the death definitively as 'natural'.

Investigators still don't know the identity of the body because they had little to go on during the initial discovery.

The man didn't have identification and the body had decomposed to the point police couldn't take point fingerprints in the field.According to police, the man did not match any descriptions for missing people in the area.
