Fight for survival: Giving CPR to heart attack patients for around 30 minutes could save more lives according to research

Giving CPR to patients in hospital for around half an hour could save more lives, claim researchers.

Conventional thinking is that cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, performs miracles in medical dramas - but in real life is pointless after 20 minutes.

Some doctors believe prolonged CPR is more likely to end in the patient's death than survival, and could result in brain damage.

But new research from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia shows that extending CPR longer than previously thought could be useful saves lives in both children and adults.

Two studies found hospital staff should persist for at least 25 minutes, and maybe even longer than 35 minutes.

CPR is an emergency technique that will supply blood to the brain and other organs of a person who is suffering a cardiac arrest and the heart has stopped beating.

Trained staff do chest compressions and may use an automated external defibrillator (AED) to deliver a shock if needed.

In the latest study published in the journal Circulation, researchers analysed hospital records of 3,419 children in the US and Canada from 2000 to 2009.

It found among children who suffered in-hospital cardiac arrest, more than expected survived after prolonged CPR-defined as lasting longer than 35 minutes.

Of those children who survived prolonged CPR, over 60 per cent did not suffer brain damage.

Dr Robert Berg, chief of Critical Care Medicine at the hospital, said: 'These findings about the duration of CPR are game-changing, and we hope these results will rapidly affect hospital practice.'

The overall results from the children's study follows an adult study of 64,000 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests between 2000 and 2008 by experts from the same research group.

Patients at hospitals where CPR was likely to persist for 25 minutes on average had a 12 per cent higher chance of surviving cardiac arrest, compared to patients at hospitals where CPR duration was shortest, at around 16 minutes on average.

Survivors of prolonged CPR had similar neurological outcomes in terms of brain function to those who survived after shorter CPR efforts.

The conventional thinking has been that the technique is futile after 20 minutes, but Dr Berg said these results challenge that assumption.

'Taken together, the adult and paediatric results present a clear and hopeful message: persisting longer with CPR can offer better results than previously believed possible' said Dr Berg.

The next steps for CPR researchers are to identify important risk and predictive factors that determine which patients may benefit most from prolonged CPR, and when CPR efforts have become futile, he added.
