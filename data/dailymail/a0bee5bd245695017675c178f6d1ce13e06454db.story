A Montana has man killed another man by slashing his throat after they argued over which branch of the United States military was better, the Army or the Marines, prosecutors say.

Charging documents claim William Earl Cunningham, 63, told police that he and Nathaniel Horn, 40, were arguing Saturday night when Horn jumped up and took a swing at him.

Cunningham told the officer he pushed Horn back and said: 'Then I cut him. I did what the Army taught me to do.'

While Cunningham claimed to have done what the Army 'taught' him to do, it was unclear if Horn had served in the military.

When
 officers arrived at the scene at East First Street, Laurel, Cunningham was leaning against a car and Horn was 
lying on the grass next to Cunningham's feet.

Horn had a cut on his 
right cheek and a deep cut on the left side of his neck, and a bloody knife three-and-a-half inches long was sitting on the picnic table.

Horn appeared to be gasping for breath as an officer applied pressure to the neck wound, court records said.

'I cut him. He's dead,' Cunningham told police. 'The knife's on the table.'

Horn was pronounced dead less than an hour later.

After Cunningham was read his rights, he told officers he and Horn were sitting at the picnic table when they began arguing about whether the Army or Marines was the best branch of the military.

William Earl Cunningham, 63, of Laurel, 
entered no plea when he made an initial appearance on a charge of 
deliberate homicide in Justice Court yesterday.

The incident occurred on First East Street, Laurel, after an argument had continued on from the previous night

Laurel Police Sargent Mark Guy said Monday that the men had argued the night before about the same issue.

Lena Heller told KULR-TV that she had invited the two men over on Saturday night and they had been drinking when they started arguing.

'I think it's horrible that somebody would just kill somebody for no reason, just because of an argument,' Heller said. 'I know it was the alcohol.'

Cunningham's blood-alcohol level was 0.217 percent, above the 0.08 limit at which a person is considered legally intoxicated, according to court documents.
