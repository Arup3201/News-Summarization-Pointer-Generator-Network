A 15-year-old boy has inspired Tesco's next best-selling ready meal - on his first day of work experience.

Matthew Lilley, of March, Cambridgeshire, stunned industry experts at the supermarket giant when he devised its next mouth-watering hit.

Product developers were so impressed with the student's beef and tomato homebake dish with bolognese sauce that they decided they would roll it out in their stores nationwide.

Matthew Lilley, 15, of March, Cambridgeshire, stunned industry experts at Tesco when he devised its next mouth-watering hit while on work experience - Beef & Tomato Wedge Bake

Matthew spent part of his two-week placement at the company's head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, developing and sampling his culinary creation - Beef & Tomato Wedge Bake -so it could be put on shop shelves this month.

The youngster said: 'We were trying different types of food and I just thought beef and tomato would be a better combination.

'They came back with a sample to taste and it developed from there. It happened almost by accident but it is very exciting.'

His homebake meal, which sells for £5 in a family-sized pack, has been available in select stores for nearly a week. 

Matthew added: 'Some of my friends at school have tried it and it seems to be getting very positive reviews.

Pasta and pizza have overtaken British dishes such as shepherd’s pie to become the nation’s most popular ready meals.

At the 
same time, sales of TV dinners have increased by 9.5 per cent overall as
cash-strapped families cut back on restaurant meals and stay in 
instead.

Sales of
Italian chilled meals rose by 14.9 per in 2011, hitting £406.7million 
and knocking British cuisine off the top spot it enjoyed in 2010. Its 
sales rose by only 6.6 per cent, to £390.7million.

The 
chilled ready meals sector is now worth £1.2billion, according to data 
released earlier this year by market research analysts Kanta Worldpanel.

Supermarket
own-label products, which already account for 92.7 per cent of the 
market, continue to go from strength to strength.

Italian food enjoyed 
particularly strong growth at Waitrose, Morrisons and Asda.

Outside 
of the top two, Indian meals came third with sales  of £167.5million, 
followed by  Chinese food on £86million and Spanish cuisine on 
£27.9million.

French ready meals only  managed to reach sixth place, on £26.3million.

Trade 
magazine The Grocer said British ready meals may have fallen out of 
favour because consumers feel they could easily make the dishes 
themselves.

'Beef and tomato homebake wasn't my favourite meal before but it is now because I made it!'

The teenager's proud mother, Claire Lilley, 41, said he was now hoping to carve out a career in food product development after his eureka moment.

Mrs Lilley, who manages two estate agents, said: 'Matthew got on really well at the placement and got some really positive communication from Tesco.

'He loved it there and it's unbelievable how well he's done.'

She said Tesco had been so impressed with his imagination and ability that it had invited him back to do some more work experience.

The company also told Matthew, who 
attends Cromwell Community College, Chatteris, which qualifications and 
what expertise he would need to succeed in the industry.

'Before
going on the placement, he wasn't sure what he was going to do but now 
he really wants to try a career in this area,' said Claire.

It
changed his focus about what he wants to do and is now looking at 
moving onto a business studies course, as suggested by Tesco.

Matthew
also carried out food tastings in restaurants and Tesco warehouses as 
well as seeing how raw suggestions ended up as the finished product on 
sale to the public.

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We're really
pleased to be able to offer work experience placements and we get lots 
of positive feedback from young people on the time they spend with us.

'Matthew brought lots of energy and ideas with him and it was great that we could turn those ideas into a finished product.'

A spokesman said it was too early to ascertain how many units of his product had been sold, or provide a figure for predicted nationwide sales.

A
crate of Matthew's special beef and tomato homebakes has now been 
delivered to his home as a sign of gratitude from the company's chiefs.

A recipe on www.greatlittleideas.com gives instructions on how to make a dish similar to Matthew Lilley's original culinary creation.

Ingredients (to serve four people):

Four large potatoes, washed and cut into wedgesTwo tablespoons olive oilOne jar Homepride Chilli Cook-In Sauce
500g beef mince
150g grated cheese

How to make it:
Place the potato wedges into a pan 
of hot water and simmer for 10 minutes. Then remove from the heat and drain. Place the potatoes into the ovenproof dish and brush the oil over the 
potatoes.

Bake the potato wedges in a preheated oven to 200ºC / Gas mark 6 for 15 minutes until crispy and browned.

Meanwhile brown your mince in a pan, then pour over Homepride Chilli Cook-In Sauce and simmer until cooked through.

Pour the chilli over your wedges, 
then sprinkle over the cheese and return to the oven for a further 5 
minutes or until the cheese has melted.

Hints and tips:
If you are in a hurry try using some ready made potato wedges and cook as directed on the pack instruction.
