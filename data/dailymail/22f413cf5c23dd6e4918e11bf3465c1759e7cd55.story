Sir Ben Ainslie will call upon Adrian Newey, the greatest Formula One designer of his generation, to help him win the 35th America's Cup for Great Britain.

Sportsmail understands that Newey will have a hand in designing the state-of-the art catamaran as the upshot of an ingenious deal announced yesterday by his current employers Red Bull, by which he will remain involved in F1 while taking on a wider brief with the soon-to-be-launched Red Bull Technology Projects.

Newey's new 'multi-year' contract also ends Ferrari's interest in signing him, despite an offer of £23million a year.

His Red Bull extension is not thought to be as lucrative as that, but it gives him what he wanted: flexibility to pursue new challenges in an environment he enjoys.

Newey, 55, had made no secret of his desire to be involved in the America's Cup and he met Ainslie at last season's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to discuss the possibility.

The issue that needed to be resolved was how he could honor his commitment to Red Bull yet take up Ainslie's offer.

The resolution, to contribute under the aegis of Red Bull Technology Projects, comes ahead of tomorrow's official launch of the British America's Cup team at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich – an event that will be attended by the Duchess of Cambridge.

Ainslie, 37, has managed to secure funding worth about $100million to take on the holders, Oracle Team USA.

Sir Charles Dunstone, the Carphone Warehouse founder and Sir Keith Mills, the entrepreneur who helped bring the 2012 Olympics to London, are among the investors.

Red Bull's Technology Projects enterprise will create new engineering jobs and develop plane, car and boat technology.

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who brought Newey to Red Bull in 2006, said: 'It's great we've come to an agreement and that Adrian's going to continue to be advising and mentoring the team going forward. Some exciting new projects will be announced in due course.

'We've got tremendous strength in depth. It's not like he's not going to be about any more.'
