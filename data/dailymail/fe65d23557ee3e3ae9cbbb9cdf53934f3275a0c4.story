Carl Mills, who is accused of killing three generations of the same family after setting fire to their home, pictured arriving at Newport Crown Court

A jealous boyfriend killed his own baby daughter, her mother and grandmother after torching their home on the day the child was released from hospital, a murder trial has heard today.

Carl Mills, 29, is accused of killing three generations of the same family after setting their home ablaze.

Kayleigh Buckley, 17, six-month-old daughter Kimberley and grandmother Kim, 46, were all trapped in their home when it was engulfed in flames.

Newport Crown Court heard how Mills started the fire after he became convinced Kayleigh had another man in her bedroom.

But the only people inside were the family - who were celebrating Kimberley’s homecoming after being born prematurely at just 1lb 9ozs in hospital.

Neighbours saw Kayleigh banging on the windows and screaming for help but they were unable to save her.

Prosecutor Greg Bull said: 'The three victims didn’t have a chance.'

He said they were unable to get down the stairs because of where the fire was set.

He said: 'Within minutes it became impossible to save the people inside. Neighbours did all the right things but they were confronted with a scene which can only be described as heartbreaking.

'Kayleigh was in the window of a smoke-filled room crying for help for her and her baby.

'People were calling out “Jump” but she wouldn’t leave her baby. Neighbours could hear her saying she was on fire.

'Then within a few minutes there was silence. All of the victims died in the fire.'

The court heard the only people in the house were grandmother Kim (left, with granddaughter Kimberley), Kayleigh and the six-month-old baby, who had just returned from hospital after being born prematurely

The court heard how Kayleigh met Mills when she was 15 on the internet - he was living in Manchester and travelled to her home in Cwmbran, South Wales.

Mr Bull said: 'He deliberately set out to groom her sexually. Their relationship developed into a sexual one. He seemed to exercise a magnetic control over Kayleigh.

'Mills became obsessively jealous of Kayleigh. He became obsessed she was involved with other boys.'

The court heard Kayleigh became pregnant with twins born in March of last year.

One twin, Angel, died at just two days after being born weighing 15 oz but doctors were able to save Kimberley who weighed 1lb 9oz.

The baby was named after her gran who gave up her job as an Avon lady to help raise her.

Mr Bull said: 'Kayleigh started acting as a mother and that was one of the factors which caused this violent crime.

'Mills didn’t want Kayleigh to spend more time with the baby. He wanted Kayleigh to be with him and him alone. He become convinced she was having an affair with another man.'

Mills was not invited to the homecoming of baby Kim when she was allowed out of the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport.

The court heard he had been threatening and controlling for months - and had been banned from the family home.

But Mills wouldn’t leave Kayleigh alone and was sleeping in a tent in front of the family home.

The family home was decorated with balloons and banners for Kimberley - but the court heard Mills allegedly flew into a rage.

The court heard texts were sent by Mills to Kayleigh on the night before she died.

One said 'I’ll burn your house down', while another read 'I hope you f****** get burnt'.

Another text read 'You lot made a mistake, a very bad mistake,' while a further text said 'Sleep with one eye open you dirty s***'.

His fingerprints were found on a welcome home banner which he had ripped down on the night of the fire in September last year.

The court heard how he also sent a string of messages taunting Kayleigh about the balloons outside the house - which the prosecution claim places him at the scene.

In the messages he threatens Kayleigh who he believes has another man in the house, saying he will cut off electricity to the house, then set fire to it, the court heard.

He also explains how he wants to blow up the oxygen cylinders there to help little Kimberly with her lung problems.

Mr Bull told how Mills started the fire in the porchway of the three-bed house - and the fire quickly spread.

He said: 'The fire extended rapidly and the stairs were soon breached and the door gave way. It created a fireball into the roof which burned down into the bedroom.

'The house was well ablaze. The fire service tried to enter but it was too ferocious. As this mayhem was developing, along came Mills.

'Neighbours were shocked by how calm he appeared to be. He showed no emotion and did not attempt to rescue his daughter or the woman he claimed to love.

'It was the actions of a cold-hearted killer who knew exactly what he was doing. He had carried out the threat he had made hours earlier.'

Mills, of no fixed abode, denies three charges of murder.

The court heard how Kayleigh’s mother Kimberley did not like Mills but made efforts to include him in the family.

Mr Bull said: 'Kim was frightened of Mills who she thought was unpredictable and threatening.

'He had violent mood swings and often threatened to do harm to them. Kim tried to involve Mills but he became more controlling of Kayleigh. His behaviour was abusive and irrational.'

The court heard how two weeks before the murders, Mills had 'trashed' the family home while baby Kimberley was still in hospital.

He was reported to police for criminal damage while the family were out of their home in Cwmbran.

The court heard grandmother Kim was given guardianship rights over the baby and Mills was not allowed to see her unsupervised.

Mr Bull said: 'Mills would not have access on his own to the baby and this caused hatred and resentment to Kim and Kayleigh.

'There were threats to both of them by setting their house on fire. Mills told Kim in a text message that he was going to burn her from the earth.'

Mr Bull said the threats reached a peak on the night baby Kimberley was due home.

Mr Bull said: 'It was meant to be a day of great joy and celebration.'

But the court heard it became one of tragedy after Mills repeatedly accused Kayleigh of having another man in the house.

He said: 'For a considerable period of hours the text messages show Mills getting more and more frustrated by Kayleigh. He was obsessive and jealous, assuming she was sleeping with someone else.'

The court heard he repeatedly texted 'Bring him out' before the arson attack at around 3.30am - just six hours after his baby arrived home.

The trial continues.
