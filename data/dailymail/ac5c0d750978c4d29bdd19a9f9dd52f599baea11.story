Police have said 
they believe the fire which killed a family of four as it ripped through
 the Florida mansion of former tennis player James Blake was part of a 
murder suicide.

Debbie 
Carter, spokesperson for Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department, 
confirmed that authorities are not looking for a suspect in the blaze, which claimed the lives of Darrin Campbell, 49, his wife 
Kimberly, 51, and their teenage children Colin, 19, and Megan, 16.

She
 also revealed that authorities did not receive any 911 calls before 
the fire was reported by a member of the public at 5.45am and two of the
 victims appeared to have 'upper-body trauma', but did not say which 
members.

'I was walking my 
dogs, and I walked by the house and it exploded!' the caller told the 
dispatcher.

Describing
 the scene inside the burnt-out mansion as 'unusual,' firefighters said 
they discovered fireworks littered through the five-bedroom home rented 
from former tennis player Blake, who was ranked fourth in the world in 
2006.

Authorities said the two teenagers were found in their bedrooms and the two adults 
were found in their bedroom. There was an accelerant was found across the 
mansion.

They also said that no weapons have been recovered from the home.

The mother of Darrin Campbell said she was distraught and confused.

'I have no idea what happened,' Mary Campbell said. 'I spoke to him last night.'

Tragic: Megan, 16, pictured left and right, 
attended Carrollwood day school, and the principal reportedly said this 
afternoon that both students will be missed

Fire: The blaze was so ferocious on May 7 that firefighters could not get in to examine the grisly scene until the next day

She added that her son knew James Blake and had been renting his house for two years.

'He
 was my baby,' said Campbell. 'I have seven kids and he was the 
youngest. He called me every single day. I’m out in Tucson, and he 
wanted to make sure I was taken care of.'

At one time, Darrin Campbell was the senior vice president at PODS, a company that provides mobile, temporary shipping and storage containers. According to his LinkedIn profile, he left PODS in 2007 and was a vice president at IVANS, an insurance company.

IVANS was purchased by another company and Campbell no longer worked there, said Matt Fogt, a spokesman for the new company, Applied Systems, who was reached by telephone.

Both children, Colin, and 
Megan, attended Carrollwood day school, and the principal said on Wednesday that they will be missed. Guards were posted at the 
front gate, turning away visitors, Fox 13 reported.

According to her Twitter, Megan won an academic award at the school just a day before the deaths.

Authorities said it is unclear whether the family was killed by the fire or 
some other cause and will remain so until autopsies are completed.

TV
 reporter Meredyth Censullo, most recently of ABC, tweeted that the 
victims had 'gunshot wounds to the head.'

In
 a follow up tweet, she cited a source as saying the bodies found in the 
burning mansion 'had heavy duty fireworks wrapped around their heads.'

Darrin Campbell was reportedly found dead on the floor, and Kimberly in a bed.

Censullo tweeted that several gas 
cans were found on the second floor of the mansion.

Campbell,
 who is originally from Detroit, Michigan, began his career in 1992 at 
Ford Motor Co, according to an article in the Tampa Bay Times.

He
 worked in various financial positions, principally financial analysis 
before moving to San Antonio, Texas as chief financial officer for the 
Pabst Blue Ribbon beer company.

In
 2000 he relocated to Tampa and joined Anchor Glass Container Co. as 
senior vice president of sales, leaving as chief executive to join PODS.

He later joined Tampa based Ivans Insurance Solutions but left three years ago.

A spokesman for the company said they did not believe he had a job to go to when he quit the company.

Crews: Emergency crews rushed t the property, pictured, after 911 calls were made before 6a.m.

In a 2005 profile of Campbell the Tampa newspaper said he and his wife had their honeymoon at Disney World in Orlando.

Campbell said he and his family visited the theme parks in the area about a half-dozen times a year.

The fire broke out before 6a.m. and Hillsborough County Fire Rescue crews rushed to the scene.

Hours
 later, firefighters were still there putting out hot spots at the home.
 It could be days before detectives are able to sift through the charred
 debris, officials said.

Blake purchased the home in Avila for $1.5 million in 2005, according to Hillsborough County property records.

Neighbors told detectives that Blake hasn't lived in the house for a while and was renting it out, police said. 

Detectives hadn't talked with Blake, whose agent said he was certain Blake was not in Florida.

'He's not in Florida, I can tell you 100 percent that he's not in Florida,' Carlos Fleming told The Associated Press.

It had five bedrooms and five bathrooms. Video of the fire showed it totally engulfed in flames.

'It's
 in the back part of Avila, the million-dollar homes. It's a massive 
home,' said Nacole Revette, a spokeswoman for Hillsborough Fire Rescue.

Rented: The mansion, in Avila, Tampa, pictured, was reportedly being rented out at the time of the fire

The Sheriff's office said they are concerned about losing evidence to the fire.

Blake's
 next door neighbor reportedly told TMZ Sports that he heard several 
large explosion in early this morning and saw an 'instant fireball 
inferno' when he went outside to check it out.

He said the sound seemed to be coming from the garage of Blake's house.

They
 added that detectives may not be able to even enter the remains of the 
home until Thursday, due to structural damage. This will delay the official 
identification of the victims.

Once it is safe to enter, investigators will likely be on site for days gathering evidence.

Avila is an exclusive enclave north of Tampa known for its mansions and heavy security.

Many
 well-known athletes call the community home and over the years, various
 football, baseball and tennis players have bought homes in the 
subdivision, which has a country club and golf course.

Blake, 34, was ranked fourth on the ATP world tour in 2006. He has a 2-year-old daughter with wife, Emily.

He
 established the James Blake Foundation, an organization dedicated to 
cancer research, in memory of his father who died of gastric cancer.
