Police have started searching properties near the home where three missing women were imprisoned for a decade after one of the victims told police there could be other girls, it has emerged.

Michelle Knight, who was found at the Cleveland home on Monday after being held against her will for more than 10 years, said that there was another girl at the home around 10 years ago.

But Knight, who herself was kidnapped in 2002, said the victim then disappeared.

In police interviews she added that she did not know how many other women were in the house because they were all locked in separate rooms, Fox News reported.

Found: Three women were found at this home in Cleveland on Monday, but police are now searching more nearby properties after one victim said there could have been more women

Along with his alleged victims, only Ariel Castro lived at the home at Seymour Avenue. His older brother Pedro lived at his mother's home, while Onil, the youngest of the three brothers, lived alone in his own home 'somewhere in the lower west side', police said.

The details could give hope to the 
family of Ashley Summer, who was 14 when she vanished on July 6, 2007 in
 the same neighborhood from where Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus were taken.

Initially Ashley was considered a runaway as had she lived with her great-uncle and they had argued prior to her disappearance.

But a year later the police and FBI 
believed Ashley was an 'endangered juvenile' who could be 'being held 
again her will'. In 2009, the FBI said they suspected a link between 
Ashley’s disappearance and those of Berry and DeJesus.

 found women

Probe: Members of the FBI evidence response team carry out evidence from the home on Tuesday

Ashley's physical appearance and the 
proximity of her home to the other disappearances lead investigators to 
suspect the cases were linked and that all three might have been 
kidnapped by the same man.

Special Agent Vicki Anderson, of the FBI Cleveland Division told Cleveland.com on Tuesday that Ashley remains in their thoughts as they gather evidence at Ariel Castro's Seymore Avenue home.

‘We are keeping Ashley in our 
thoughts as we go every step of the way,’ she said. ‘Whether it is 
something we find at the house, or someone seeing the stories remembers 
something, we continue our search for Ashley.’

A cadaver dog, along with various law enforcement officers, searched Ariel Castro's Cleveland home on Tuesday, said Anderson. But police 
revealed they had not found any human remains at the house despite fears
 up to five babies could be buried in the garden.

But police did confirm on Wednesday that they found ties and chains inside the home.

'We have confirmation that they were bound, and there (were) chains and ropes in the home,' Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said, adding that authorities did not miss opportunities to find them.

Prior
 to the disclosure of the naming of the women discovered on Monday, 
Summers' family had briefly thought their daughter could be amongst 
those discovered. 

'We're hoping that it's connected, and they knew where she was,' her aunt Debra Summers told CNN. 'We're hoping for a miracle.'

Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she 
vanished in 2004, while another alleged victim Amanda Berry, right, was 16 when she went missing in 2003. Both women were found on Monday

Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing

The Summers family is renewing 
their efforts to publicize Ashley's disappearance.

The FBI's missing 
person website says Ashley Summers has a tattoo of 'Gene' enclosed in a 
heart on her upper arm, and her birthday is June 16, 1993, making her 19
 years old.

Investigators will speak to Gina 
DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight to see if they know anything 
about Summers' disappearance.

On
 Tuesday, Cleveland Police said: 'Every single lead was followed up on 
no matter how small. We dug up yards, canvassed neighborhoods. [The] 
real hero is Amanda Berry.'

Until now the search for the missing women had been fruitless, a series of false leads and bitter disappointment for the desperate families.

Michelle Knight, who was 20 years old
 when she went missing in August 2002, was last seen at a cousin's house
 near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue.

Three
 years later, in April 2003, Amanda Berry, disappeared after leaving her
 job at a Burger King - at West 110th Street and Lorain. It was the day 
before her 17th birthday.

And a year later, Gina DeJesus, then 14 years old, was last seen leaving her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain.

All
 three were found safe on Monday night after Berry bolted from a home on
 Seymour Avenue, about three miles from where they were last seen.

She
 told police that she and the other girls were being held prisoner by 
Ariel Castro, 52, who has been arrested along with his two brothers, Pedro and Onil, on 
suspicion of kidnapping.

Cadaver
 dogs appeared at the home following fears babies were born inside the 
Cleveland house. At least five children may have born at the house, 
police sources told NewsChannel5.

One
 victim suffered up to three miscarriages because she was so 
malnourished, while other sources told WKYC the captors would beat the 
pregnant women, so that the babies would not survive.

Ashley Summers was 14 years old  when she was reported missing in 2007 from her home in the same neighborhood where Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus had vanished

It is unknown what happened to any 
children who were born at the home, but one six-year-old girl, Jocelyn, 
was found inside the home.

She was born to victim Amanda Berry, 
27, while she was imprisoned, and authorities said she is 'happy and 
healthy' despite growing up in captivity.

Authorities are now investigating how the horrors inside the home went undetected for so long.

Neighbour
 Israel Lugo said other neighbors had seen naked women crawling on all 
fours behind Castro's house. Three men were in the garden and were 
controlling the women, he said.

'We
 thought it was funny at first, and then we thought that was weird so we
 called the cops,' neighbor Nina Samoylicz told CNN. 'They thought we 
was playing, joking, they didn't believe us.'

Neighbors waited for police for two hours but no patrol cars showed up.

Cleveland police said that the department has no records of a call for service to that home.

But the claim is one of a number of stories to have emerged from neighbors who say they reported unusual goings-on at Castro's Seymour Avenue, Cleveland home to local police who either didn't respond or didn't enter the house when they did show up.

Lugo said he also called police after his sister saw a woman and a baby standing in a window at the home which was half covered by a plank.

Lugo also said his mother was puzzled when Castro would park outside the home in his yellow school bus. He would go inside clutching bags of McDonalds and sodas.

It has emerged that Ariel Castro would allegedly use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried to run free.

It is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling.

But on Tuesday, Cleveland Police said: 'Every single lead was followed up on no matter how small. We dug up yards, canvassed neighborhoods. [The] real hero is Amanda Berry.'

Until now the search for the missing women had been fruitless, a series of false leads and bitter disappointment for the desperate families.

The
 exact circumstances of the abductions is currently unclear, and it is 
not known whether or not the kidnapper deliberately targeted the block 
where all three victims were taken.

The three brothers are expected to be arraigned before the end of the day.
