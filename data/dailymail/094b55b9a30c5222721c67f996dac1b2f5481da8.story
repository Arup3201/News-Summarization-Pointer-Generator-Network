In ancient civilizations it was the number of labours undertaken by Hercules, the amount of gods who lived on Mount Olympus and the total signs of the Zodiac.

But now the number 12 has cropped up in another mystifying setting - on a baby's forehead.

Hanru van Niekerk was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on November 11, 2014, with a strange birthmark on his face in the shape of digits '1' and '2'.

Cute: The family of the little boy, who lives in Johannesburg in South Africa, spotted the markings soon after he was born on November 11 2014

Doctors have reassured the family of the boy, now four months old, that the markings will gradually fade with time.

Great grandmother Catherine Jooste told the Northcliff Melville TImes that they have embraced the peculiar birthmark, which was a 'beautiful surprise'.

She said: 'My youngest daughter was the first one to see it and she said there is a 1 and a 2 on his forehead. 

'We did not worry about it, his doctor said it will fade as he gets older.' 

According to NHS Choices, birthmarks come in two main categories, vascular or pigmented.

Vascular birthmarks tend to occur in the head or neck area, being caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin, which can fade after a few months.

In comparison, pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown-coloured, caused by a cluster of pigment cells.

Most birthmarks are harmless and don't need to be treated.
