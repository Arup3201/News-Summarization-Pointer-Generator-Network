Mayor Michael Bloomberg shocked New York when he openly admired a woman's derriere as he mingled at an event.

An author introducing himself to the politician along with a friend said the politician ignored them in favour of pointing out another guest's figure.

The writer related the anecdote in a profile article on Christine Quinn, Speaker of the New York City Council and frontrunner in the upcoming mayoral election, published Sunday in New York Magazine.

‘My friend thanked him for his position on gun control,' wrote Jonathan van Meter. 'Without even acknowledging the comment, Bloomberg gestured toward a woman in a very tight floor-length gown standing nearby and said, “Look at the a** on her.”’

The article doesn’t mention the name of the woman in question, but Ms Quinn gives some further description about how the Mayor likes the ladies around him to look.

‘The mayor is going to yell at me when I 
get out of the car because I have flat boots on,' she told Mr Van Meter, in a separate anecdote in the story.  The mayor has no use 
for flat shoes.’

Ms Quinn was sporting a new pair of soigné black English riding boots, which though stylish, she predicted would be a point of contention when she met with Mr Bloomberg later that day.

‘I was at a parade with him once and he said, “What are those?” and I said, “They’re comfortable,” and he said, “I never want to hear those words out of your mouth again,”’ Ms Quinn recounted.

The criticisms don’t stop there, as she added that he also takes issue when the gray roots begin to show in Ms Quinn’s trademark flame red hair.

‘The couple of days a week before I need to get my hair colored, he’ll say, “Do you pay a lot to make your hair be two colors? Because now it’s three with the gray,”’ she said.

But Mr Bloomberg is not the only one who can play the smart alec - Ms Quinn is known for her quick wit and Irish sense of 'telling it how it is'.

‘I’m like, “Did you wake up being this big of an a**hole? Or did it take, like, all day to ramp up to it to be able to insult me like that?”’ she retorted.

Bloomberg, 69, is known for his outspoken comments.

In 1996, three years after divorcing  his 
Yorkshire-born wife Susan Brown, he told The Guardian: 'I am a single, straight billionaire in Manhattan. It's like a wet dream.'

The pair married in 1975 and have two 
daughters - Emma in 1979 and Georgina in 1983 - who featured on Born
 Rich, a documentary about the children of the extremely wealthy.

Bloomberg now lives with Diana Taylor, former New York 
state banking superintendent, on the Upper East Side, and the couple regularly travel to his retreats in places like Bermuda and Paris.

During his 2001 campaign, his opponents attacked him for supposedly fostering an atmosphere of hostility toward women at his company. He was criticised for his attitude towards women taking maternity leave.

Democrat Mark Green highlighted an incident in which he allegedly told a pregnant woman at his company to 'kill it' and allegedly added: 'Great, No. 16' - which she cited as reference to the number of pregnant women in the company at the time.

He settled the case three years later, without an admission of guilt, for an undisclosed amount.

The New York Daily News assembled a 
harvest of other complaints, including those of women who alleged they had been urged to wear 
their skirts shorter.

After Bloomberg won the mayoral race, but before he was sworn in, New York magazine reported that he had a 'needlepoint pillow beside his bed [that] reads, "How Many Heterosexual Billionaires Are There, for Crissakes?"'

Joyce Purnick wrote in her book that one top aide had recalled: 'An attractive woman would walk into the bullpen and the mayor would say "nice tits" — he just couldn't help himself.'

In 2009, he confessed that he had a crush on an English ‘honey’ – actress Honeysuckle Weeks.

The politician was overheard telling another Englishwoman, editor and columnist Tina Brown, that he had 'fallen in love with' Ms Weeks after a friend sent him a complete collection of the drama Foyle’s War.

He celebrated the New Year a month ago by kissing Lady Gaga in Times Square, shortly 
after they had led the crowd in a final-minute countdown to midnight.

But the mayor said afterwards: 'Lady Gaga is very charming. It was fun. I would be remiss if I didn’t also add to that that the best kiss of the night came after that from Diana.'

Ms Quinn may have been unimpressed by what she describes as Mr Bloomberg’s ‘potty mouth’ during her tenure as Speaker and his lengthy three terms as mayor, but she had also earned his expected endorsement.

To many, she is seen as the Bloomberg-approved candidate to take over when he leaves office after 12-years in power this November.

The billionaire is not the only male politician to grant their seal of approval.

The article also noted that former President Bill Clinton gave Ms Quinn a rave review at a 2006 fundraiser, when he said that his wife, then-New York Senator Hillary Clinton, had told him: ‘You will not believe how good this woman is… She’s even a better politician than you are.’
