Veteran war correspondent Marie Colvin inserted a clause into her will expressly designed to stop her former husband benefiting from her £1.1 million estate,The Mail on Sunday has learned.

Journalist and author Patrick Bishop was ‘mystified and upset’ last night to find she had gone to such lengths. Friends were equally baffled as the pair were apparently on good terms.  

Bishop said he would never have challenged the will, nor did he expect to inherit any part of 56-year-old Colvin’s estate. Indeed, having remarried two years before the document was drawn up, he would have been legally unable to do so.

Both he and Colvin had remarried since their divorce nearly 20 years ago, but had apparently remained good friends until she was killed by Syrian army shelling in the besieged city of Homs last February, while on assignment for The Sunday Times.

Despite their closeness, however, she went out of her way to specify that he should not be among the beneficiaries of her will.

The document, drawn up in 2010, stated: ‘I wish to make it known that Patrick Bishop, my former spouse, is deliberately not named in my last will and testament. I do not wish him to inherit from it, and I make this clause expressly known should he attempt to contest it.’

A legal source confirmed that under the 1975 Inheritance Act, former spouses or civil partners can contest a will only if they have not themselves remarried.

Shocked Bishop, 60, said last night: ‘I didn’t know what was in the will and it’s rather upsetting to hear.’

Ms Colvin gives an address at St. Bride's Church in November 2010, saying: 'We always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story'

He insisted he never had any intention of contesting the will, adding: ‘Nothing could be further from my mind. I don’t know what is behind it. We were on good terms and it’s a complete mystery to me.’

The pair married in 1989 but had  a tempestuous relationship and divorced in the early Nineties. US-born Colvin’s second marriage, in 1996 to a Bolivian journalist, was even briefer.

One old friend of Colvin was last night equally baffled by the will’s contents, but suggested the famously fiery journalist might have been temporarily upset with Bishop when she wrote it.

‘As far as I know they were on pretty good terms when she died,’ said the friend, who declined to be named. ‘I’m sure there was no deep animosity between them.

‘More likely is that she was miffed at something he’d said or written at the time she drew up the will, and in a fit of pique just decided to add a clause which said “**** you, Bishop!” and probably would have forgotten about it the following day.

‘It’s a shame, really, because few people were there for her as much as Patrick – he may well have saved her life in Chechnya.’

After their divorce, Colvin and Bishop were reunited in 2000 in the most dramatic fashion when she was reporting on the war between Chechnya and Russia.

She became trapped with rebel fighters as the Russians surrounded their position, leaving only a treacherous 12,000ft mountain pass to Georgia as their escape. In an  eight-day midwinter journey, she waded through chest-high snow and braved altitude sickness, hunger and exposure.

Bishop, also a foreign correspondent, heard of her predicament and set off from Paris to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. 

There, together with her colleague Jon Swain, he helped to organise  a helicopter from the US Embassy to pluck her off the mountainside  to safety.

As Colvin wrote: ‘I was never happier to have an American passport.’

Similarly, in 2001, when she was badly injured and lost an eye from a grenade explosion in Sri Lanka, it was Bishop she turned to, describing him as her ‘nurse’.

Bishop is now a successful author of books such as Bomber Boys, about the Second World War pilots of Bomber Command, and Follow Me Home and 3 Para, which both chart the British Army’s bloody campaign in Helmand Province.

In 2008 he married writer Henrietta Miers and they live in West London with their young daughter. 

He paid fulsome tribute to Colvin after she and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed by Syrian forces at a makeshift press centre in Homs. It was believed they were deliberately targeted.

Probate records disclose that Colvin left £1,228,403, reduced  after liabilities to a net estate of £1,140,470. The will left the bulk of her estate to a niece, two nephews, a sister and a brother.

But she also left £100,000 to her close friend Lady Jane Wellesley, and a painting of a boat to her partner in recent years, businessman Richard Flaye.

Her final request was that she should be cremated and her ashes scattered on the River Thames.
