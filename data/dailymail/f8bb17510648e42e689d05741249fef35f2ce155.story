Holly is being held in the Benton County Jail on capital murder, kidnapping and residential burglary charges. He is due to appear in court today.

Jersey, whose father and stepmother are in prison for chaining the little girl to a dresser last year, was found dead just minutes after she was reported missing from her bedroom on the morning of November 20.

Julie Pickard, who lives on the other side of the home where the six-year-old's body was found, said that Holly wept before authorities removed Jersey's remains.

'He was crying for a long time,' she told The Associated Press.

She said police knocked on her door later that day and asked her to let them know if she saw a man wearing Mountain Dew pyjama pants.

'[Holly] was wearing Mountain Dew pyjama pants,' Ms Pickard said.

Bentonville Police are yet to release details of how the little girl died or what led officers to arrest Holly, who worked at local restaurant The Flying Burrito Company.

Arrested for murder: Zachary Dewayne Holly with his wife Amanda Jo Holly

Newly weds: Zachary Dewayne Holly and Amanda Jo Holly were married in March, according to their Facebook pages

There was no answer yesterday at the mobile home where police say 
Holly lived with his wife. A child's bicycle rested on a patch of grass 
near the home in the city.
Bentonville Police chief Jon Simpson said the couple didn't have any children 
but that Holly's wife has a child who is 'pretty much the same age as 
our victim'. Simpson described Holly as 'an acquaintance' and a friend 
of Jersey's family.

Jersey's death comes after her father and stepmother chained the girl to
a dresser last year. David Bridgeman told investigators he restrained 
his daughter to prevent her from getting into medication and other 
things around the house in nearby Rogers.

David Bridgeman and Jersey's stepmother, Jana Bridgeman, pleaded guilty 
in June to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and 
endangering the welfare of a minor.

She is serving a 12-year prison 
sentence, plus three years for a probation revocation. He is serving an 
18-year prison sentence.

Simpson said many questions about the investigation would be answered when a probable cause affidavit is released today.

In the meantime, those who knew Jersey are remembering the little girl 
who was still joyful despite what was, by all indications, a difficult 
life.

'I don't know how she dealt with it, but she dealt with it and she still
smiled the whole time,' family friend Mike Whitcomb said.

Tragic: Jersey Bridgeman recently celebrated her sixth birthday

Simpson
said Holly would have a bail and probable cause hearing Wednesday, 
during which a probable cause affidavit will be released. He said the 
girl's family had been notified about the arrest.

Holly lives next door to the six-year-old victim, in between her house and the vacant house where her body was found.

Holly, 28, states on his Facebook page that he lives with his wife Amanda Jo Holly and her four-year-old son and that he graduated from Huntsville High School in Texas in 2004.

Amanda Jo Holly is Facebook friends with Jerseyâ€™s biological mother, DesaRae Bridgeman.

Bridgeman
said she last saw her daughter around midnight, before reporting her 
missing around 6.30am. Authorities found her body approximately 10 
minutes later.

After
Jersey's body was found, investigators searched the home where she 
lived and the house where her body was found, as well as the homes in 
between.

The FBI was
brought in to assist in the investigation.

Meanwhile, it is still unclear where DesaRae Bridgeman was at the time of the missing persons call.

Bentonville
police have said that certain details of the case were being 
withheld 'to maintain the integrity of the investigation'.

After the arrest of her father and stepmother, Jersey was put under the care of her biological mother.

According to police reports, she died between midnight and 6.43 am, when police received the call that the girl had gone missing.

Police said the six-year-old had been living with a 'relative' when she went missing.

Questions: Holly is due to appear in court today in Arkansas, U.S.

Jersey made headlines last year when her father and stepmother chained her to a dresser as part of a punishment. In conversations with childcare specialists, the six-year-old said that she slept on the floor of her parents' room and that she was tied up for misbehaving.

Behind Bars: Jersey's father was sentenced to 18 years in prison for having chained the girl to a dresser as punishment

'She said that Jana and David chain her to the dresser because she had gotten up and eaten some pies, cereal, and bread,' Rogers Police Detective Larry Taylor wrote in the court affidavit.

He added that the girl 'stated that they put a belt around her waist so that she could not get up and get any food.'

The woman who first contacted the police 
about possible child endangerment said she saw Jersey tied up to the dresser with a 
silver chain, which appeared to be a dog collar.

Jersey's father David admitted in court that he did tie up his daughter with a belt but defended his actions by saying that this was to prevent her from getting into medication and other dangerous materials around the house.

'He said that he thinks she may be sleepwalking and that they discussed buying a child gate, but since he does not have a job, they could not afford to buy one at that time,' Taylor wrote in the court affidavit.

The father added that he had first cut a belt to fit around his daughter's ankle and added a lock on it after she had broken free. Then after she complained about the pain in her leg, he chained her by the waist instead.

'It should be noted that the chain that David used was approximately one to two feet in length and appeared to be a dog choke collar,' Taylor added.

Both Bridgeman's father and stepmother pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. For their crime, the father is serving an 18-year prison sentence, while the stepmother was sentenced to 12 years.
