Vandals today destroyed an art sculpture in central Paris ‘because it looked like a giant sex toy’.

Looming above the city's Place Vendome, the 24ft tall piece, created by American artist Paul McCarthy, was meant to look like a green inflatable Christmas tree.

But the artwork, simple entitled 'Tree', raised eyebrows in the French capital because of its uncanny resemblance to a certain type of sex toy.

Target: The sculpture, which the artist insists was meant to resemble a tree, was erected ahead of next week's Contemporary Art Fair. It was not clear whether 'Tree', pictured earlier this week, could be repaired

Today it was left as a giant pile of deflated plastic after vandals apparently took a number of sharp objects to it overnight. The incident came after claims that it 'humiliated' the French capital. 

A police spokesman said: 'The attack happened in the early hours this morning. 

‘The attackers ignored metal fences surrounding the object, and effectively destroyed it.'

He added that  ‘every effort was being made’ to catch those responsible for destroying the work.

It was not clear whether the piece, which was erected ahead of next week's Contemporary Art Fair, could be repaired - but many argued that it should not be. 

‘With luck it will be cleaned up and thrown in a dustbin,’ said Marjorie Klein, a 55-year-old visitor to the city who was among many inspecting the damage today.

French kiss: Some social media users said that the sculpture 'humiliated' the French capital. Artist Paul McCarthy was himself physically attacked last Thursday, soon after unveiling the sculpture

‘It was a disgusting work – it’s clearly been destroyed because it looked like a giant sex toy, and Parisians don’t want a giant sex toy in one of their most beautiful squares.’

Jerome Dubus, of the opposition UMP party, also had tough words for Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, saying she should ‘end this provocation and remove the art work’ for good.

Artist Paul McCarthy was himself physically attacked last Thursday, soon after unveiling the sculpture.

The 69-year-old was slapped in the face as an unidentified assailant shouted: ‘You’re not French, and your work has no place in this square.’

McCarthy was left ‘very shocked', before asking ‘does this sort of thing happen a lot in France?’

He confirmed, however, that the comparison to a sex toy was not far wrong, explaining that it had started with a joke. 

The artist said that he thought it had a shape 'similar to the sculptures of Romanian artist Constantin Brencusi'. 

He added that people could be offended if they wanted to think of it as a sex toy, but said that to him 'it is more of an abstraction'. 

A spokesman for conservative group French Spring had complained that the sculpture 'disfigured' and 'humiliated'.

McCarthy is no stranger to controversy and is known for artworks corrupting innocent symbols of youth, from Disney to Hollywood.

A very merry Christmas: Paul McCarthy's completely innocent sculpture showing Santa holding a tree. At a 2011 exhibition  he displayed a pair of clay anamatronic sculptures of former president George W Bush having sex with pigs

At a 2011 exhibition in London he displayed an identical pair of clay anamatronic sculptures of former president George W Bush having sex with pigs.

A description of the Paris exhibition on the Flashart website states: 'Aside from their looming proportions, these familiar objects appear bizarrely out of place in the polished surrounds of the historical building.

'This surprising juxtaposition draws us into the magic of Hollywood and the dark side of the American dream.'
