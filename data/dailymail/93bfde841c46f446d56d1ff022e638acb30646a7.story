Iain Duncan Smith said 200 people a week are moving off welfare due to the benefits cap

Some 200 people a week are ‘turning their lives around’ and moving off welfare due to the benefits cap, Iain Duncan Smith said.

The threshold of £26,000 a year per household has now capped the handouts of 55,000 families since it was introduced in 2013.

In total about 800 people per month have either found employment or are no longer claiming housing benefit, the Department for Work and Pensions said. 

Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said the policy restored fairness to the system and would save £225million over the two years since it was introduced.

‘As well as restoring fairness to the system and saving the taxpayer money, the benefits cap provides a clear incentive to the get people into work’, he said.

‘Today’s figures show that the cap has led to hundreds of people breaking free from welfare dependency every week, and gaining the financial security and esteem which comes with a job and pay packet. That’s real people their lives and the prospects of their families around.’

Critics have expressed concerns that the vast majority of those subject to the cap, which is £500 a week for families and £350 a week for a single adult – do have children.

But the figures show that around 40pc of those whose benefits are no longer capped, or around 12,500 people, have moved into a job.

DWP officials say these former claimants are ‘making the most of almost 700,000 vacancies in the economy and contributing to record levels of employment.’

Before the cap was introduced in April 2013, some 300 of the highest earning families raked in over £9million in benefits every year.

Ministers have hailed the cap as a success in making sure no family is making more money on benefits than in employment, for which the average salary across the UK is £26,000.

David Cameron said promised to cut it to £23,000 as his ‘first act’ if he wins a second term, which would slash benefits by a further £60 a week and save the taxpayer £135million a year.

Mr Cameron said in an interview this month that reforms of the welfare system were a ‘deeply progressive programme’ that is ‘changing people’s lives.’

According to a poll by Ipsos Mori last year, nearly half of benefit claimants hit by the cap on welfare payments said they were doing more to find work than before.

And despite predictions by critics that the cap would cause misery – it found 45pc of those affected said they had felt spurred to get a job. Many had sent off more applications or were using agencies or careers centres to help them find employment.
