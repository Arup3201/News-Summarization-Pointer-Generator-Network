Chris Coleman will name Sam Vokes in a Wales squad for the first time in a year on Wednesday - and believes that allows Gareth Bale to spell more danger for his country.

Vokes has not featured for Wales since scoring in a 3-1 victory over Iceland last March as he ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament three weeks after that Cardiff friendly.

But striker Vokes has been a regular off the Burnley bench since Christmas and started his first Barclays Premier League game on Saturday when the Clarets shocked Manchester City to win 1-0 at Turf Moor.

That has convinced Coleman he is ready to play some part in the crunch European Championship qualifier against Israel on March 28 and free Bale again to cause maximum damage in Haifa.

'He obviously missed the start of the season after his injury but he's had some games and minutes under his belt now,' said Coleman.

'It's good for us because Sam gives us something different.

'He's not just a big target man, he's got a bit more to him than that and it will be good to have the big man back

'Maybe he can come on for half an hour or play for an hour if he starts because defenders don't like playing against that very strong and brave forward who can get a goal.'

Vokes' return also spells good news for Coleman as far as the deployment of Bale is concerned, especially as his main man ended his nine-game scoring drought on Sunday by scoring both goals in Real Madrid's 2-0 league victory over Levante.

Bale has often had to plough a lone furrow in Vokes' absence rather than causing mayhem when cutting in from either flank.

Gareth Bale, pictured after scoring against Andorra, has led Wales' forward line in the absence of Vokes 

The Real superstar scored twice in Wales' opening 2-1 Euro 2016 win in Andorra in September to make it 11 goals in his last 16 international appearances but he has not found the net in the three qualifiers since.

'Maybe we can now release Gareth somewhere else,' Coleman said.

'Gareth's been up there by himself because in the last camp Simon Church was also injured and he's had a job to do for us.

'But we can look at it with another angle with big Sam coming back.'

Coleman's side head to Haifa with themselves and Israel the surprise early front-runners in Group B and fancied pair Belgium and Bosnia-Herzegovina having ground to make up in the section.

Group leaders Israel have won their opening three games while unbeaten Wales lie in second place after beating Andorra and Cyprus and picking up points against Belgium and Bosnia.

Wales boss Chris Coleman is hoping Vokes' return will allow Bale to return to his natural role 

Coleman has hit on a settled side and he hopes he will be able to call on Hull defender James Chester, who has been out of action since dislocating a shoulder in January.

Chester has been a revelation since joining the set-up last year and has developed a formidable centre-back pairing alongside captain Ashley Williams, with Wales conceding only twice in four qualification games so far.

'It will be touch-and-go for James and he's done brilliant for us,' Coleman said.

'But we're lucky we've got someone of James Collins' experience to come in.

'He's got the type of mentality to go to a place like Israel where it will be heated and front it up and lead.

'It's going to be tough because they're top on merit but if we're serious about qualifying we've got to go there and get something.'
