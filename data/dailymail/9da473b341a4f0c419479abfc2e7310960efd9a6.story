Rio and Anton Ferdinand’s mother has been treated in hospital.

Janice Lavender came under considerable strain earlier this year as she watched her sons become publicly embroiled in a race row with former England captain John Terry.

The news of her health emerged today after the footballers’ sister Sian St Fort tweeted about her mother.

The nature of 53-year-old Janice’s illness has not been revealed and it is not known if it is directly related to the stress of the recent court case and FA hearing into Chelsea star Terry’s alleged racist remarks to Anton.

Relieved: Chelsea captain John Terry was cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence

The protective mother was in attendance at Westminster Magistrates Court in July when Terry was cleared of racially abusing QPR defender Anton, 23.

It was alleged that he maliciously 
called Queens Park Rangers defender Anton a 'f****** black c***' 
during a match on October 23 last year.

But Terry insisted he was sarcastically repeating an accusation by Ferdinand.

Janice also had to look on as her elder son Rio, 33, was hit with a £45,000 FA fine for improper conduct after calling Ashley Cole a ‘choc-ice’ on Twitter.

A user, believed to be a man from the Derbyshire area, referred to Chelsea star Cole as a 'choc ice' on the site.

Rio then replied: 'I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic hahahahahaha!!'

Derbyshire Police said they were investigating the original Tweet after receiving complaints from members of the public.

The 'choc ice' term is understood to mean 'black on the outside, white on the inside'.

Following the FA's ruling the 
brothers staged their own protests by refusing to wear T-shirts in 
support of football’s anti-racism campaign Kick it Out.

Janice is back at her home in Mottingham, south-east London, but has refused to talk about her health.

Rio and Anton’s younger sister Sian St Fort revealed that Janice had spent time in hospital before tweeting a picture of some flowers and a get well soon message.

She said: 'After a long week of struggle in the hospital mum has finally been allowed home. #strongwoman #loveyou.'

Laughing off: Rio Ferdinand appeared to endorse the tweet branding Ashley Cole a 'choc ice' by responding: 'I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic. Hahahahahahhha!!'

Denial:
Ferdinand later tweeted: 'What I said yesterday is not a racist term. 
It’s a type of slang/term used by many for someone who is being fake. So
there'

Responding to a friend’s get well wishes, Sian said on Twitter: 'She’s been really ill. She’s recovering slowly but surely... get well soon mum!'

Her tweets followed a Sunday newspaper report that Janice had been subjected to verbal abuse in the street as a result of her sons’ public feud with Chelsea stars Terry and Cole.

According to the the Sunday People, a friend of the family said: 'She has been verbally attacked in the street and can’t believe this has all been allowed to happen.

'She has slept very little due to worry. She hoped it would be over now but it isn’t.

'She has been really down but is also angry at what her sons have been forced to go through.'

The source also said Janice did not accept John Terry’s apology at the conclusion of the FA hearing in which he was found guilty of using racist language, fined £220,000 and banned for four games.

They said: 'Janice doesn’t think it makes up for what happened. She thought it was flimsy.'

Manchester United star Rio appeared to bury the hatchet last weekend by wearing a ‘Kick It Out’ T-shirt in the warm-up to his side’s game against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and even shaking Ashley Cole’s hand before kick off.
