Ashya King’s pioneering cancer treatment in the Czech Republic will be paid for by the NHS after all, it was announced last night.

The parents of the five-year-old, who suffers from a brain tumour, sparked an international manhunt when they removed him from an NHS hospital last month without the permission of doctors.

Brett and Naghemeh King had applied for their son to be given proton beam treatment while he was being cared for at Southampton General Hospital but the health service rejected the request and recommended radiotherapy.

NHS England today confirmed it will now pay for Ashya King's  proton beam treatment in Prague, Czech Republic

After a row with doctors the couple took him out of hospital and went abroad in the hope of getting the proton beam treatment in the Czech Republic. It is believed to cost more than £60,000.

A European Arrest Warrant was issued and the Kings, from Southsea, Hampshire, were arrested in Spain where they owned a holiday home.

They were taken into custody and released only after Ashya had spent three nights away from his parents in a Spanish hospital. Eight days after they had removed Ashya from hospital a High Court judge gave them permission to fly to Prague to begin the treatment.

Ashya was transported to the Proton Therapy Centre in the Czech capital to start his proton treatment earlier this month. Doctors at the clinic have previously told how 70-80 per cent of patients in his condition survive

Now, in a major U-turn, NHS England said last night that it would fund the treatment under the reciprocal healthcare arrangements that exist within the EU.

A spokesman for the health service said the cost was not yet known. NHS England said in a statement: ‘Our thoughts are with Ashya and his family as he begins follow-on radiotherapy.

‘Now that Ashya is in Prague, it is clearly best that he continues to be treated uninterrupted so the NHS has agreed to fund this care, as requested by his parents, in accordance with relevant European cross-border arrangements.

Ashya's parents have repeatedly told how they believe the proton beam treatment will help their young son

Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with Ashya after 72 hours in a Spanish jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow him to undergo proton therapy in Prague

‘We all join in wishing him well, and greatly hope he makes a full and successful recovery.’ Ashya is already said to be ‘showing progress’ at the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague.

Earlier this month the clinic said that he was ‘smiling more and able to move his limbs’.

His attending doctor, radiation oncologist Dr Barbora Ondrova, said: ‘There is a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate for the condition such as Ashya has.

‘There is now every reason to hope that he will make a full recovery.’

Ashya is having a type of radiation treatment that uses beams of protons – one of the building blocks of atoms – rather than X-rays. They can be targeted directly at a tumour and stop once they hit the target instead of carrying on through the body as conventional X-rays do.

This means much less damage is caused to surrounding tissue, according to the NHS.

Earlier this month it was announced that proton beam treatment will be available in this country from 2018.

NHS England will spend £250million on two proton beam units in Manchester and London. 

The £30million Proton Therapy Centre where Ashya King is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer-fighting technology.

Built in 2012, the gleaming white lobby of the five-storey building on the outskirts of Prague appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas.

The centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target. For brain tumours, this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours, staff claim.

A course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits. Sessions never last more than 30 minutes.
