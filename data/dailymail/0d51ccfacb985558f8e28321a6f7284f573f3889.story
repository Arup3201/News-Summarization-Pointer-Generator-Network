Residents of Glastonbury are used to putting up with the odd inconvenience when 135,000 turn up for the village's famous music festival every year.

But many have lost patience with their latest travel woe which appears to defy logic.

Motorists are facing a 20-mile detour while maintenance works are carried out on just 60 feet of road.

Detour: The work to lay a new gas pipe will require workers to dig up just 60 feet of the road

The epic detour takes motorists on a 20-mile, 37 minute journey through two neighbouring villages before returning to Glastonbury

Somerset County Council has issued a notice of the closure, expected to last for two days, on a stretch of the A361 Glastonbury to Shepton Mallet road.

Although Wales and West Utilities are digging up just a tiny part of the road near Wellhouse Lane to lay a new gas pipe, it must be closed forcing drivers to take a 37-minute journey back through Shepton Mallet and Wells.

One Glastonbury resident, Brian Young said: 'It's a mammoth detour. I'm reasonably sure I'll be exploring some back roads during the road closure, because the diversion just seems a little bit on the ridiculous side.'

A spokesman for Wales and West Utilities said: 'Wales & West Utilities are doing all we can to minimise inconvenience to the public and to local businesses during the road closure, and it is our full intention to complete this work on schedule.

'We would like to thank the residents and businesses of Glastonbury for their co-operation, patience and assistance while this essential gas mains replacement work is carried out.'

Somerset County Council said a diversion had been put in place and they hoped the work would be completed as quickly as possible.

A spokesman said: 'We understand the disruption this road closure will cause to residents and we hope the work will be completed, safely and as quickly and efficiently as possible.

'Although this sort of work can be inconvenient to motorists, this is essential maintenance that needs to be carried out.'
