The brother of a young woman who died from bowel cancer - despite being told she was 'too young' to get the disease - has spoken out to try and spare other people the same fate.

For six months Suzanne Gould went to see doctors, complaining of crippling stomach pains.

The agony was so severe that the 29-year-old was forced to miss part of her brother Rob's wedding.

But doctors told the biomedical technician she was too young to be suffering bowel cancer, instead diagnosing her with Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease.

Suzanne Gould died in March after an 18-month battle with bowel cancer. After complaining of severe stomach pains doctors told her she was too young to be suffering the disease, diagnosing her with Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel syndrome.

Today Dr Gould's brother Rob Newton, pictured with his sister as children, said he is determined to raise money and awareness in his sister's memory. She died on March 18, aged 29, just weeks after doctors revealed her condition had become terminal

In November 2012, Dr Gould's condition deteriorated and she was rushed into A&E.

She was taken into surgery, where doctors discovered a huge tumour invading her bowel.

For the next 18 months Dr Gould battled the disease, frequently being admitted into hospital for rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

But in February she and her family received the news they had been dreading - the cancer was terminal.

In her final weeks her friends and family celebrated her 29th birthday, and prepared to say their goodbyes.

Weeks later on March 18, the Kingston University technician, from Dorking in Surrey, passed away.

Today her brother Mr Newton, 30, said he is determined to raise money and awareness in his sister's memory.

Mr Newton said his sister was adamant she wanted to help others, allowing her case to be presented to the government to help research and education

He said: 'When she was diagnosed with a tumour, it was devastating but equally frustrating that we hadn’t known sooner.

'But through it all Suzanne handled her treatment with dignity and bravery.

'She was not only positive and determined to beat cancer but wanted to raise awareness in young people that you can never be too young to have bowel cancer.

'It was a huge shock when we discovered it was terminal.

'But throughout it all Suzanne was bright and upbeat.

'She was that kind of person, wanting to help others and stay strong for her family.'

Dr Gould spent months in the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton where she endured bouts of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to try and treat the cancer.

She was also treated in Medway Hospital and finally cared for in St Catherine’s Hospice in Crawley.

But she lost her fight on March 18, leaving behind her lecturer husband, Dr Simon Gould, and her family.

Mr Newton is now planning to complete a fun run for 
the World Cancer Research Fund to help the network of charities in their
 quest to prevent cancer.

Bowel cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is the third most common cancer in the UK.

In 2011, 42,747 cases of the disease were diagnosed across the country.

Symptoms include blood in the stools, a change in bowel habits, abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss.

Bowel cancer is one of the most preventable forms of the disease.

Scientists estimating about half of all cases in the UK could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, choosing a healthy diet, not drinking alcohol, and being physically active.

There are a number of lifestyle factors that will increase a person's chance of developing bowel cancer. They are:

- Being overweight or obese- Lack of physical activity- Diets low in fibre- Diets high in red and processed meat- Drinking alcohol- SmokingOther risk factors include:- Age, risk increases as you get older- Family history of bowel cancer- Personal history of polyps or inflammatory bowel diseaseThe majority of bowel cancer cases can be successfully treated if they are detected early enough. That is why it is important to take part in NHS bowel screening when invited.

On June 5 he will run 3km in a bid to raise funds and awareness of the link 
between cancer and diet, physical activity and body weight.

'Suzanne didn’t just focus on herself when she was ill,' he said.

'She
 was a case study for Bowel Cancer UK presentation at the Houses of 
Parliament because she wanted to help with research and education.

'We
 now need to continue her legacy and this run is all about raising 
awareness about the condition and helping to collect much needed money 
for cancer prevention research, which can lead to early diagnosis and 
more effective treatment.

'Bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in the UK, but if diagnosed at an early stage, it's very treatable.

'She left us on March 18, gone but never forgotten.'

Michael Smeaton, World Cancer Research Fund’s deputy head of fundraising, said: 'We’re honoured that Rob is raising money for us.

'Cancer can be devastating and it is thanks to people like Rob and his company Informa that we can continue to fund vital research into preventing this disease.'

Scientists say about a third of cancers could be prevented if people were to maintain a healthy body weight, eat a healthy diet and be more physically active.

Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK. In 2011, around 42,000 cases of bowel cancer were diagnosed.
