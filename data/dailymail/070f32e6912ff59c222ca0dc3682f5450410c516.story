An artistic director who had acid thrown in his face outside his Moscow home may have staged the attack himself, his colleagues have alleged.

Artistic director of Russia's illustrious Bolshoi Ballet Sergei Filin, 42, nearly lost his sight after suffering third-degree burns to his face and neck in the attack two weeks ago.

But dancers and staff at the Bolshoi Theatre have claimed Filin may have staged the attack himself.

Anastasia Meskova, a Bolshoi ballerina, told the Financial Times: 'It is an absurdity - such an insane idea.

'But I understand where it is coming from, because, truly, you throw up your hands; you just can't explain it.

'You think "maybe this? But of course not! Maybe that? Of course not!"'

The latest allegations come amid talk of infighting, backstabbing, soaring egos and constant rows between the key players at the theatre.

Bolshoi spokeswoman Yekaterina Novikova said Filin had received threats before the attack.

'We never imagined that a war for roles - not for real estate or for oil - could reach this level of crime,' she said.

The
Bolshoi, which has both ballet and opera troupes, reopened last 
February after a six-year renovation to its landmark colonnaded 
building, close to Red Square in the very centre of Moscow.

As a symbol of Russian 
culture for more than 200 years, it is a big draw for both locals and 
foreign tourists, and has seen power struggles among both dancers and 
directors throughout its history.

Since
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of those conflicts, 
whether driven by egos or artistic convictions, have been played out in 
public.

After the 
tightly controlled three-decade tenure of Yuri Grigorovich ended in 
1995, the Bolshoi Ballet went through five artistic directors before 
Filin's appointment.

In 2003 Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi,
dismissed ballerina Anastasia Volochkova after reportedly saying she 
was too heavy for male dancers to lift.

And in 2011, a senior ballet 
manager resigned after a scandal over sexually explicit photographs.

Filin, a Moscow native, joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic director in March 2011.

The theatre in the heart of Moscow is
an enduring symbol of Russian culture and a big draw for both locals 
and foreign tourists, but has seen power struggles among both dancers 
and directors during its tumultuous history dating back more than 200 
years.

Filin, a former leading dancer at the 
Bolshoi who has been in the high-pressure job at the heart of Russian 
culture for nearly two years, was attacked outside his Moscow apartment 
building as he returned from the theatre.

Filin,
a Moscow native, joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was 
named its artistic leader in March 2011, after three years in a similar 
position at another Moscow theatre.

There was 'fierce rivalry' for the Bolshoi position at the time, according to RIA Novosti.

Such is the power and prestige of the post in Russian life that Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, said he believed the attack was a product of envy or rivalry.

Filin had already reported having his car tyres slashed and his emails hacked, as well as receiving repeated nuisance calls from someone who stayed silent when he answered.

'He said, "I have a feeling that I am on the front lines",' Iksanov quoted Filin as telling him Thursday before the attack.

'The culprit should be sought among those for whom it was beneficial to compromise the theatre leadership', Iksanov told reporters.

'This two-week campaign has ended tragically and despicably,' he said.

Iksanov said Filin had told him he believed he had been followed home, and that the attacker had called him by name before throwing acid on his face.

'There are very serious burns on his face, in his ears, his forehead, his mouth, and of course there are serious concerns about his eyesight,' he said.

Filin's mother, Natalya, said he had been threatened but that she did not know who could have been behind the attack, state-run RIA news agency reported.

'What's important to me now is the health of my son, that he not lose his eyesight,' she said.
