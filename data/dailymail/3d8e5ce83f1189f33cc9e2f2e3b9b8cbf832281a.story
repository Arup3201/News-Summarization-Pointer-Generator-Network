I wish Roy Hodgson and his staff had stayed out in Brazil at the World Cup because there is so much to learn here.

The battle for the future of English football starts straight away and there are so many different tactics and systems to watch and learn from at this tournament.

You have to put your disappointment at going out early to one side and find inspiration.

Back home: Roy Hodgson returned straight to England after their World Cup exit

It’s not difficult here: it’s like the car show at the NEC, you want to see what the other manufacturers are up to. So it’s good to see  managers such as Roberto Martinez and Arsene Wenger out here lapping it up.

Yes, managers might be looking for a signing or two but it’s more about improving tactically and finding out what’s in vogue. Martinez is just the type of man who is brave enough to innovate.

And the men given the task of rebuilding England are not here. Let’s hope Hodgson, Ray Lewington and Gary Neville are watching all these games together at home, looking for the system to improve England’s fortunes.

Scouting: As has Everton boss Roberto Martinez

It’s important to watch the games as a team so you can bounce ideas off each other and discuss how certain systems could work.

These teams are show- casing their systems so our think tank should be here. If they’re not watching, we’re in trouble because we’re light-years behind.

These are some of the systems and  tactics that have impressed me . . .

CHILE’S MIDFIELD TRIO

The midfield three that Chile used so successfully is based around its flexibility.

Jorge Sampaoli used Arturo Vidal, Marcelo Diaz and Charles Aranguiz in the centre of midfield, but unlike an English three, they swapped positions all the time.

When you watch Liverpool or England, for example, it is clear that Steven Gerrard is the  holding midfielder and there are two ahead of him.

Chile’s midfielders just rotate all the time, which makes them very hard to defend against.

They offered great protection to the back three, too, which was necessary considering Gary Medel and Francisco Silva were relegated with their clubs last season and Gonzalo Jara has been released by Nottingham Forest.

If anyone does try to mimic it in the Premier League, Louis van Gaal is the man to counter it. His Holland side man-marked Chile’s midfield three and they ended up winning the game comfortably.

UNDERLAPPING FULL BACKS

England’s full backs were rigid during our three games, generally stuck near the touchline. Watch Colombia and you will see the problems their full backs give the opposition.

Pablo Armero — who did not impress during his loan spell at West Ham last season — and Juan Zuniga are key to Colombia’s attack, making underlapping runs inside their wingers.

People aren’t sure how to track them.

It’s something Leighton Baines has done for Everton and Glen Johnson for Liverpool so there is no reason England couldn’t use the tactic.

France are very good at pushing their full backs forward too. From the off, they are dictating to the opposition, creating a feeling of expression throughout the team.

PLAYERS ARE ADAPTABLE

Dirk Kuyt started the game against Mexico on the left wing.

Later he moved to the right wing then to right back and excelled in all.

Chile’s Vidal played at the front of the midfield three against Brazil but has been a centre back at times for his club Juventus.

Adaptable: Dirk Kuyt played in several different roles for Holland

SWEEPER KEEPER

Manuel Neuer got Germany out of trouble so many times against Algeria — again and again rushing out of his box to clear danger.

It’s something we have seen  Hugo Lloris do for Tottenham in the Premier League but others may look at it.

I can’t see it suiting England, however, as Joe Hart has had trouble coming off his line in the past. Like Neuer, you need to have the pace of a central defender.

Let’s hope Hodgson and his team aren’t missing all this.

Those of us lucky enough to be out here have got a window on some of the best thinking in  football as it is played out in Brazil.

England’s coaching team really should be here.

Hodgson and his coaching staff should have stayed in Brazil to learn, believes Keown

England need to find a new system to improve in the future

Chile's midfield, Colombia's fluidity and Manuel Neuer's goalkeeping are amongst the things to have impressed Keown at the World Cup so far
