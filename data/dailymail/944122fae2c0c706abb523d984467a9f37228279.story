President Barack Obama's chief spokesman said Monday that most on the tens of thousands of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border are unlikely to qualify for humanitarian relief 
that would prevent them from being sent back from their home countries.

The
 pointed warning came as the White House prepared to send a funding request to
 Congress detailing the additional money Obama 
wants to spend hiring more immigration judges and opening new detention facilities to deal with the border crisis.

White House 
officials told the Associated Press that they planned to ask Congress for more than $2 billion on Tuesday.

White
 House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration also wants lawmakers to give it the legal authority to sidestep a 2008 law requiring a careful evaluation of each child before deportation proceedings can begin.

Obama lunched with a group of teachers in the Blue Room at the White House on Monday as his press flack Josh Earnest explained that most unaccompanied illegal immigrant children will be sent back to Central America, but asked Congress to authorize fast-track deportations

Crisis: More than 47,000 unaccompanied children have entered the country illegally since Oct. 1, including 9,700 in the Month of May alone

Hot seat: Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said Sunday that 'we need to find more efficient, effective ways to turn this tide around'

That law, passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress, was meant to provide protection for children brought into the U.S. as part of human trafficking schemes, mostly related to the illicit sex trade.

In the absence of a move on Capitol Hill, the federal government has no choice but to treat the deluge of children arriving from Central American countries the same way.

That process can take weeks or months and tie up resources – including U.S. Border Patrol agents – making the border even more porous.

Complicating the situation is a new set of data released last week by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, showing that the Obama administration has deeply curtailed efforts to deport minors or  turn them away at the border.

In 2008, the last year of the Bush administration, 8,143 such children were prevented from staying in the U.S. In 2013 that number was just 1,669.

Earnest told reporters on Monday that that while the administration will 
allow the required immigration review process to unfold, officials so far 
don't expect many of the children arriving at the border to be able to 
stay in the U.S.

'It's
 unlikely that most of these kids will qualify for humanitarian relief,'
 Earnest said. 'It means they will not have a legal basis for remaining 
in this country and will be returned.'

Department of Homeland Security 
Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged Sunday on the NBC show 'Meet the Press' that it could take a long time for those deportations to begin.

'Our
 border is not open to illegal migration, and we are taking a number of 
steps to address it, including turning people around faster,' Johnson said.

But 'we need to find more efficient, 
effective ways to turn this tide around generally,' he said, 'and we've already 
begun to do that.'

Johnson
acknowledged that the unaccompanied children, some 9,700 taken into custody in May alone, pose a vexing problem.

Most
 of the children are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The White House is asking Congress for the authority to fast-track deportations to those three countries in particular.

Hurry up: Newly minted White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the influx of unaccompanied minors at the border won't change deportation policy, but that the administration wants the authority to act faster

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R) was House Speaker in 2008 when Congress passed the law that the Obama White House now ants relaxed

While the Obama administration claims spikes in violence 
and poverty have prompted parents there to send their children on difficult 
and dangerous journeys north, Republicans contend that Obama's own 2012 immigration policy shift is to blame.

That summer the president held a Rose Garden press conference to announce one of many 'executive actions,' a move to delay for two years the deportation of U.S. residents brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

This year the White House extended that delay for another two years. As word of a new leniency filtered southward, aided by opportunistic traffickers, the current flood of children crossing the Rio Grande river into Texas, and evading border patrols in Arizona and New Mexico. 

Johnson
 said the U.S. government is trying to send the message that all people 
who enter the country illegally will face deportation proceedings 
eventually.

But in Central America, he said, 'the criminal smuggling 
organizations are putting out a lot of disinformation about supposed 
free passes into this country' that will expire soon.

The resulting onslaught has overwhelmed federal agencies. When 140 would-be immigrants – mostly mothers with children – were flown to southern California to 
ease an overcrowded Texas facility, angry residents of Murrieta, 
California, greeted the bus as it pulled into town, complaining that 
they were being saddled with more than their share.

'This
 is a failure of diplomacy. It is a failure of leadership from the 
administration," Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week.'

Rep.
 Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, crossed party lines Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union' to complain that the White House 'is one step behind' a foreseeable crisis since numbers of children coming from 
Central America without adults has been rising dramatically since 2012.

Unaccompanied
 Central American children generally are being released to relatives 
already in the United States. Mothers with their children often are 
released with a summons to appear later in immigration court.

Meanwhile, word of seemingly successful border crossings reaches their home countries, encouraging others to try.

South Carolina Republican Sen.
 Lindsey Graham said Sunday on the CBS 'Face the Nation' program that children entering the country illegally 
must be sent home.

If not, he said, 'you're going to incentivize 
people throughout that part of the world to keep sending their children 
here.'

Graham
 also said foreign aid should be cut off to countries that don't do more to 
discourage illegal immigration to the United States.
