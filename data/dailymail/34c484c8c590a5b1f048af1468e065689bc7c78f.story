Death threats made against a New Zealand referee who disallowed a goal during a World Cup clash between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Nigeria are being investigated by police.

Peter O'Leary has become deeply unpopular with Bosnian fans after their team lost by one goal to the African nation, sparking more than 23,000 people to sign a petition calling for his resignation.

The disputed goal was scored by Bosnia's Edin Dzeko in the 21st minute of the match played on June 21.

Further fuelling the outrage is a picture of the New Zealand World Cup referee laughing with the victors after the game - which has since gone viral.

In the Change.org petition, Bosnian fans have also asked football governing body FIFA to amend the final score to 1-1, which would allow their team to advance to the next round in the tournament.

Police confirmed to the New Zealand Herald on Tuesday they were liaising with Interpol after threatening comments were levelled at O'Leary by disgruntled fans.

'DIE PETER O' LEARY !!! Just die IDIOT!' one signatory wrote on the petition.

Another wrote: 'If this petition doesn't do anything, I'm gonna go up to his doorsteps at (midnight) and burn him and his house.'

New Zealand Football referee development officer Ken Wallace told the New Zealand Herald he had spoken with O'Leary after the match and said the World Cup referee was frustrated by the fans' reaction but was happy with his performance.

Mr Wallace said O'Leary and his referee assistants would now undergo a FIFA review process.

But the development officer had no concerns for his colleague's safety, saying security around referees in Rio de Janeiro was 'fantastic'.

Bosnian fans have labelled him the 'amateur who ruined the country' after Peter O'Leary's refereeing decisions cost Bosnia-Herzegovina the match and the chance to progress out of the group stage

Bosnia's loss, which followed a 2-1 defeat to Argentina, meant the team was eliminated from the competition as they needed at least a draw to stand any chance of progressing. They play their third and final game against Iran on Thursday morning (Australia time).

Dzeko's goal was disallowed on the grounds that he was offside - but replays showed he was actually behind the last defender and therefore onside.

After the match a furious Dzeko said the referee was 'shameful' and had cost them the game.

When asked what happened, he replied: 'The referee happened.'

'We are going home, we are sad because of that but the referee should go home too, because he changed the result, he changed the game, and that's why we lost.'

Peter O'Leary came under fire for his decision to disallow the goal scored by Edin Dzeko in the 21st minute of the match

The petition, which calls for Peter O'Leary to be fired and for the score of the match to be altered, has attracted more than 20,000 signatures

The online petition, created by Kraxon UO from Sarajevo, has asked that O'Leary be fired from his role as a World Cup referee and the score of the match be changed to 1-1.

'The most of people that watched Bosnia-Herzegovina saw goal scored by Edin Dzeko in 20 minute,' the petition reads.

It calls on FIFA to 'change [its] system of referees and to change [the] result to 1:1 because the goal was denied, also try to hire professional referees in World Cup 2014.'

Underneath the picture of O'Leary and the Nigerian goalkeeper, the caption reads: 'This file should tour the world! Share the picture! Show them how much we are damaged!'

Bosnian soccer fans have taken to social media to express their outrage at the decision, with one user captioning a picture of O'Leary: 'This amateur destroyed the country!'

Another wrote: 'Clear the ref was against Bosnia even the commentators said that it was not off side when Bosnia scored. It was a foul when Nigeria scored. He pushed the hell out of the Bosnian player on purpose and you could clearly tell that. So not fair. Bosnia deserves to go ahead.'

'After everything that's happened in [Bosnia-Herzegovina] in the past 2 decades and the recent floods, this nation somehow made it to the World Cup and was on its way to put smiles on people's faces until this amateur robbed of us of what was rightfully ours,' wrote another.

Football New Zealand and FIFA could not be reached for comment.
