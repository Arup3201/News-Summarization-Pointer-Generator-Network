Dragons’ Den star and businessman Duncan Bannatyne has reportedly dropped out of a £60,000 deal after it was revealed to be linked to a British millionaire being investigated for murder.

Mr Bannatyne, 65, had pledged the sizeable investment to Tracy Baker on Tuesday’s nights Dragons’ Den in return for a 35 per cent stake in her franchise of UM!Brands tech business – a stick and peel glue-type product to help mount household items.

However, the Scottish entrepreneur has now apparently decided he wants ‘nothing more to do with it’, after it was revealed Ms Baker is the fiancé of 45-year-old Ian Griffin who is accused of killing a former girlfriend.

Griffin (right), from Chesire but who now lives in Cannes, is accused of murdering his former girlfriend Kinga Legg, 36 (left). She was found dead n the bathroom of their £1,000-a-night suite at hotel in Paris, France in 2009

Mr Bannatyne's alleged U-turn comes after Griffin boasted that he was linked to Ms Baker's business idea - telling friends on Facebook he had 'won dragons den' with the idea.

Griffin, originally from Cheshire but who now lives in Cannes, France, allegedly killed his then girlfriend Kinga Legg, 36, during a trip to Paris in 2009.

The Polish businesswoman, who ran a successful firm exporting more than 300 million tomatoes a year to major companies such as McDonald’s and Tesco, was found dead in the bathroom of their £1,000-a-night suite at the Hotel Bristol.

Griffin fled the scene and was found two weeks later in woodland near Chelford, Macclesfield, less than 15 minutes from his parents' Cheshire home.

He was arrested under Section 9 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which covers any murder or manslaughter committed outside the UK.

After nearly two years of legal argument and health concerns in British custody, he was extradited to France in May 2011.

He was sent to Fresnes, one of the toughest high- security prisons in Paris, while the investigating magistrate decided on charges and whether the case should come to court.

However, in March last year, he was unexpectedly released from custody by the judge who ruled he was no longer considered at risk of absconding or a risk to other people.

Griffin's fiancée took home a £60,000 investment for her franchise of Um!Brands tech business – a stick and peel glue-type product to help mount household items – during the BBC's Dragon's Den which aired on Tuesday

Tracy Baker, 33, is said to have rekindled her relationship with Griffin while he was in custody in Britain

He now lives in Cannes, France, and remains 'under investigation' for murder. He faces trial for the offence of which he is accused, although it is thought a trial date has not yet been set.

It was while he was in custody in Britain that he rekindled his relationship with Ms Baker, a former girlfriend who sympathised with his plight and often visited him.

The pair became engaged immediately after his release from French prison last March.

It is thought to have been around this time that Ms Baker invested in the Um!Brands franchise.

On Tuesday night's Dragons’ Den, she told the panel of potential investors how she was effectively acting as a 'distributor' for the innovative product and wanted investment to help major stores take orders.

While Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones, Piers Linney and Kelly Hoppen opted against the investment, Mr Bannatyne appeared to like the concept and pledged £60,000 in funding in return for a 35 per cent stake.

Griffin took to Facebook last month to inform friends he had 'just won the dragons den' and did it 'from prison through my girlfriend'. The posts are thought to be in relation to Tuesday's episode which was filmed in spring

However, after Ms Baker’s links to the alleged murderer were revealed following airing of the show, Mr Bannatyne reportedly opted out of the business deal.

A source to the star told The Sun: ‘Duncan knew nothing of the background to the business. When he found out he wanted nothing more to do with it.’

In the wake of Tuesday night’s show it emerged businessman Griffin had boasted on his Facebook page how it was him who had 'won' the investment.

In a post last month, he said: ‘Forgot to mention, just won the dragons den last week too. Did that from prison though my girlfriend :).’

In a separate post, he also wrote: ‘We are on TV for 12 minutes in the next 30 days, its prime-time and national and possibly global too. I had to use a different name due to my position at the moment but I think you will recognise the face beaming away.’

It is thought the posts were in relation to last night’s episode which was filmed in the spring.

Griffin has been under investigation for murder since 2009 when his former girlfriend, Polish businesswoman Kinga Legg, was found dead in the bathroom of a £1,000-a-night suite at Hotel Bristol (above) in Paris, France

However, there was no sign of Griffin during the episode and the BBC has categorically denied he was involved in any of the filming or had been on the set.

His fiancée also denied yesterday that he was the brains behind the business – claiming his posts were in reference to another venture.

She told The Sun: ‘Ian was talking about another business – he has nothing to do with the company.’

MailOnline has contacted representatives of Duncan Bannatyne and Tracy Baker for further comment.

UM!Brands creates a range of products which mount housewares using nano-suction technology

Tracy Baker went on BBC’s Dragon’s Den to lay out a business plan for her franchise of UM!Brands.

The U.S.-based UM!Brands is an innovative product using nano-suction technology which allows items such as hooks and mirrors to adhere securely to any surface.

It claims to leave no mark to the surface and sticks far better – holding a weight of up to 10 pounds – than any normal sticky-glue type adhesive product.

The nano-suction – using the power of millions of miniature suction cups which can barely be seen by the naked eye – can be applied to the back of most housewares for easy mounting.

UM!Brands sells a range of products which are already backed with the clever technology, including hooks, frames, mirrors and notepad organisers.

While the brand is already popular in the U.S. and sold in major chains such as Walmart and Staples, Miss Baker told the Dragons she had obtained exclusivity rights to sell to the UK and Europe.

She said she had already received an order from Wilkinsons – which has some stores currently stocking the product – but wanted investment of £60,000 to help with point of sale and marketing via her website.
