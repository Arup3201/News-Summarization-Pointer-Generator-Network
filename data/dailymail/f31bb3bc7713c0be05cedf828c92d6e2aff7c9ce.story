California police discovered a hidden cave with illegal gambling machines and guns after being called to a house for suspected domestic violence.

Officers in Fresno arrived at a house where yelling had been reported and saw that two men were running around inside after they first met a scared woman and child.

Police did not find the suspects but discovered the two men when they found that a chicken coop on skateboard wheels outside one of the walls concealed an underground lair.

Officers saw two men running around inside the home but then could not find them when they entered to see if anyone was hurt. They were later found in the hidden cave

A secret staircase led to a room with TV surveillance of other parts of the house, guns, ammunition, illegal gambling machines and tools.

Marijuana plants were found Saturday night in the house's garage, though police say no evidence of a drug lab was found in the lair. 

Daniel Marquez, 39, was arrested on three counts of felony child endangerment.

Kue Vang, 33, was booked on one count of gambling machines, two counts of filing down gun serial numbers and three counts of child endangerment.

Officers say that the lair was hand-dug by the suspects and that the hidden cave was structurally unsafe

Lee Khammany, 33, was arrested for a probation violation.

The suspects were taken from the house, which is located next to an elementary school, without incident.

Police said that the lair, which the suspects were still in the middle of digging by hand, was structurally unsafe, according to KFSN. 

Battalion Chief Thomas Cop said that it reminded him of Forestiere Underground Gardens, a collection of catacomb-like passageways and rooms built in Fresno by artist Baldassare Forestiere in the early 20th century.
