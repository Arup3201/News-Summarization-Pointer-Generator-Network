Those who were there are hardly likely to forget some of the more shameful scenes. Fans on both sides, as well as neutral bystanders, can only hope that the return of Scottish football’s most intense rivalry doesn’t create the kind of febrile fury that rained down from the steep slopes of Celtic Park almost 16 years ago.

‘I know what this game can be like, I remember 1999,’ says Neil McCann, the former Rangers winger, before quickly adding: ‘But I don’t think Sunday will be like that - I hope not.

‘It’s fair to say that was the most volatile game I have been involved in. Anything that could happen did happen that day, on and off the field. 

Rangers' Neil McCann celebrates scoring the opening goal during the game on May 2 against Celtic

McCann put Rangers on their way to a 3-0 win over Celtic away from home in an iconic Scottish rivalry tie

McCann also scored the third goal as Celtic lost 3-0 in Scottish football's most intense rivalry

13 mins: Giovanni van Bronckhorst slides in Rod Wallace on the left wing and his cross is touched past Stewart Kerr by Neil McCann to hand Rangers an early lead. Celtic’s defence, including on-loan Scott Marshall, is nowhere.

31 mins: Celtic defender Stephane Mahe, who has already been booked, reacts badly to a tackle by McCann and is sent off by Hugh Dallas. Furious Mahe has to be dragged off the park.

41 mins: A minute after a fan runs on the pitch, a coin is flung from the stands and hits Dallas, flooring the whistler. His cut forehead later needs four stitches.

43 mins: Dallas recovers and awards a penalty to Rangers after Vidar Riseth is adjudged to have pulled Tony Vidmar back in the box, prompting some more fans to invade the pitch. Jorg Albertz converts the spot kick.

53 mins: Celtic keeper Stewart Kerr is only booked despite handling the ball outside the box. Kerr is one of 10 players cautioned throughout the sorry proceedings.

76 mins: Dick Advocaat’s side seal the match - and the title - Neil McCann nets his second goal of the evening after sprinting clear of the floundering Celtic defence.

86 mins: Rangers striker Wallace is shown a red card for a furious reaction to Riseth’s late challenge on him.

90 mins: Riseth is shown the third red card for a second booking after a lunge on Vidmar beside the corner flag.

Full time: Rangers players celebrate winning the title at the home of their fierce rivals for the first time by indulging in their own verson of the Celtic Huddle. Missiles are thrown as they make their way to the dressing room.

‘I am confident it won’t get to that stage. There were a lot of things that happened away from the park that day that you don’t see but, in terms of the actual game, it was one of the most eventful Old Firm games in memory.’

The notoriety of that May clash at Celtic Park has endured well enough, although it’s still worth recalling some of the key facts surrounding the title-clinching 3-0 win for the visitors. None of it makes for pretty reading.

More than 100 fans were arrested. Three players - Celtic’s Stephane Mahe, Vidar Riseth and Rangers’ Rod Wallace - were sent off. Referee Hugh Dallas was left bloodied by a missile thrown from the crowd, then had the windows of his home smashed afterwards. One man was stabbed outside the ground, while others sustained injuries in the battles that followed the game.

There were pitch invaders, a victorious Rangers team mocking the Celtic huddle – and being pelted with missiles for their cheek – while it all ended with multiple inquiries and, in the best tradition, questions in the House. Which rather puts Ally McCoist and Neil Lennon snarling at each other on the touchline in perspective, doesn’t it?

McCann, whose two goals - allied to a Jorg Albertz penalty - were overshadowed by the atrocious scenes, was brave enough to admit after the game that he’d been frightened for his own personal safety. He echoed the thoughts of a vast majority when he said: ‘Sunday is a huge fixture but, because there has not been a game of this magnitude for a number of years, the most important thing is it passes safely.

‘That’s the biggest concern. I don’t know if it will be harder to police because it is a neutral venue. If it was a home game then the away fans can be shepherded in. But hopefully it can be a good event, as it’s one that’s been sorely missed.’

The good news for all is that, while anyone who saw the ring of police surrounding the pitch for the closing stages of that game in 1999 might have considered this fixture beyond reprisal, it did recover.

As ugly as it has been at times, as horrible as the atmosphere may be in bar rooms and front rooms beyond the control of police and stewards, we haven’t seen anything approaching that level of trouble since. Long may it continue.

There are dark murmurings ahead of Sunday, of course, with some wondering what might happen if – and it’s a possibility – a very strong Celtic side simply steamroller their opponents.

‘I’m not saying that is going to happen,’ said McCann, when asked about he subject of any on-field events provoking violence. ‘It comes down to supporters having a responsibility. You can never account for everyone but the most important thing is the safety aspect.

‘Hopefully everyone can enjoy the occasion and welcome back the Old Firm fixture.’

Enjoyment for those blessed/cursed to spend their lives supporting one side or the other is, of course, entirely dependent upon how their team fare. It’s hardly outrageous to suggest that optimism is more prevalent among Celtic than Rangers supporters at present.

McCann conceded: ‘Rangers are in real trouble at the moment. The sides are worlds apart in terms of the performances on the pitch. It could be really tough for Rangers.

‘You just want to see Rangers back for the good of Scottish football. We knew this game would come around. We would have liked to see it in the top league but it’s the cup and one team are going in very strong and another who are a lot weaker.

‘But I still believe Rangers have guys in that squad who, if they get things right tactically, there is a chance an upset could happen.

‘I say upset because the odds are massively against Rangers, because of the way things are at the moment.

‘Kenny McDowall has to be well prepared and get the players ready for it. He needs to get a level of performance out of them that’s a lot higher than we have seen this season.

‘At this moment you’ve got to fear the worst - but you never know. Celtic are a strong side and they have a lot of confidence and swagger. But Rangers fans will still expect a performance and a result though, regardless.

‘The phrase “nothing to lose” doesn’t apply in an Old Firm game. You could say a lot of people might not expect you to get a result - but there’s always something to lose in an Old Firm game.

‘I’ve experienced both sides. I was on the end of a hiding after the 6-2 game at Celtic Park. That wasn’t good, I locked myself away for a week until the storm passed. I’ve been on the other side after winning.

‘It doesn’t matter how you go into the match, whether you are strong and in form, it can never be viewed as a meaningless match. It doesn’t matter if they haven’t played for a few years. It’s still Celtic v Rangers and there is so much history.

McCann was a feature of the day but even the Rangers man admits anything could happen on and off the pitch

‘You can never be ready for it unless you’ve experienced it, no matter what advice you get from the guys who have played in it 20 times. Nothing prepares you for when you walk out.’

The atmosphere on Sunday may surpass almost anything experienced by even hardened Old Firm fans in the modern era, with absence having hardened the edge on a rivalry that has always been on the keen side of sharp, to say the very least.

For the love of all that is still bonny about the beautiful game, let’s all hope that the heat and noise at Hampden is contained, controlled and kept within the bounds of acceptable responsibility. However the game itself goes, the last thing Scottish football needs is even a handful of half-wits deciding to rammy like it’s 1999.
