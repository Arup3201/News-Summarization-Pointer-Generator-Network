Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted Gino DiCaprio (pictured), whom they had known for 20 years, when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child

A deaf couple desperate to have a baby were scammed out of £12,000 by a friend who told them he could arrange a surrogate birth, a court has heard.

Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted Gino DiCaprio, whom they had known for 20 years, when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child.

The 52-year-old, who is also deaf following a hit-and-run accident, conned the couple into handing over £6,000, believing that he had arranged a surrogate birth.

Then when he told them the child had been born disabled, they parted with another £6,000 pounds for another baby.

However, a judge heard that there never were any babies and 'devious liar' DiCaprio continued to fleece the childless couple with a bogus foreign property investment deal promising a return of up to £400,000.

The conman is now starting a prison sentence for the scams which left Mr and Mrs Musselwhite devastated emotionally and financially.

He told the couple he would use his contacts in Kenya to arrange for a mother to carry their child after they had failed to conceive.

The couple handed over £6,000 before being told the baby was born disabled. A deal for a second baby was reached but DiCaprio extracted more money by saying the child was ill and there had been visa complications to delay its arrival.

He even sent them fake pictures of the baby he called Amy, which he had actually taken from a photographer’s website.

In a separate scam, DiCaprio persuaded Mr Musselwhite and his mother Doreen to invest £55,000 and £34,000 respectively in a fake property development in Kenya.

Alexia Durran, prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, said that DiCaprio met the couple in a group for deaf people around 20 years ago and was considered a good friend.

He discovered they were trying for a baby through his ex-wife and embarked on 'a sophisticated fraud' to convince them he could arrange a surrogate mother to give them the child they wanted.

'In June 2011 he arranged for Sonia to meet with a man known only as Carl, who said he could arrange the surrogate for them,' said Miss Durran.

'She took out a loan and paid £6,000 to DiCaprio who said he would pass it on to Carl, who never appeared again.'

The couple were told a mother, named Melissa, had been found to carry their child.

'Mr Musselwhite said DiCaprio attended the Oxford fertility clinic, where he appeared to speak with the receptionist, leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to Kenya.'

DiCaprio told the couple this child was suffering from Down’s syndrome.

'The Musselwhites were upset at this news as they thought the child’s disability, combined with their own deafness, would mean they would be unable to communicate together,' said Miss Durran.

DiCaprio told the couple, from Reading, Berkshire, they would have to pay for a second mother to be found and a further £6,000 pounds was handed over after he said a woman named Jenny Maghanga had agreed.

'He told them the baby had been called Amy and sent them photographs,' said Miss Durran.

Mrs Musselwhite gave up her job in February 2013 to prepare for Amy’s arrival but DiCaprio repeatedly said complications had come up which required more money before she could come to England.

'They were told Amy had spina bifida and had to have an operation, that she was suffering with malaria and that there were difficulties with her visa,' said Miss Durran.

A woman claiming to be Jenny Maghanga called Mr Musselwhite and demanded more money, as did DiCaprio, who said if it was not paid the baby would be given to someone else.

Investigations found no paperwork documenting the transfer of eggs and sperm to Kenya, which is strictly regulated by fertility clinics and the photographs purporting to be Amy were in fact taken by a London photographer of his daughter and uploaded online.

DiCaprio had already convinced Mr Musselwhite he was involved in a building project in Kenya which, once completed, would earn investors a large return.

'Mr Musselwhite was persuaded on three
 occasions to remortgage his home and take out high-interest loans, to 
the amount of £55,000,' said Miss Durran.

In
 2007, Mr Musselwhite’s mother Doreen became concerned after finding out
 his mortgage, which had originally been for £35,000, was then 
for £143,000. After the scheme was explained to her, Doreen 
attempted to find out what was happening between 2007 and 2008.

In
 2011, DiCaprio emailed Mr Musselwhite telling him he would be receiving
 £90,000 after seven Kenyan apartments were sold, in exchange for
 £1,500 in legal fees.

He showed his mother the email and 
DiCaprio visited her in early 2012 to show her false documents claiming 
rights to build and land ownership in the African country.

DiCaprio, from Rossendale, Lancashire, told Mr Musselwhite he would be paid a total of £400,000 and asked Doreen for £9,000 which would make her £105,000 in return.

She paid the money and also agreed to a further £25,000 for an eventual return of £140,000. Neither Mr Musselwhite nor his mother has ever seen any return on their investments.

DiCaprio was arrested on September 3, 2013, and admitted telling the Musselwhites he could arrange a surrogate mother and that the two children suffered the disabilities described, but said he had lost contact with ‘mother’ Jenny Maghanga.

'He described himself in relation to this operation as just being a mediator and denied he had kept any money given to him,' said Miss Durran.

He told police he had several bank accounts in Kenya but could not provide details and claimed he had been sent the photographs by Jenny.

The court heard he had 11 previous convictions for numerous offences dating back to 1982, including theft, forgery and making false statements. He was jailed for eight years in 1992 for robbing a jeweller while armed and for two years in 1999 for attempting to obtain property by deception.

Rebecca Randall, mitigating, asked for leniency from Judge Reddihough as prison would be 'more onerous,' for DiCaprio due to his deafness - who accepted what he did was wrong.

'He has now shown some sympathy, empathy and understanding of the consequences of his actions on the Musselwhites.'

The court heard DiCaprio was keen to pay compensation to his victims, and a Proceeds of Crime Act confiscation hearing is due to take place on June 13 at Reading Crown Court.

Miss Randall said DiCaprio was born partially deaf but lost hearing in both ears in a hit-and-run accident in the early 1990s, which contributed to his offending as he lost his job and independence as a result of it.

She added that he had been abused as a child and was only recently coming to terms with the idea it may have impacted on him. The court heard DiCaprio has a wife and six-year-old child, who is also deaf, living in Kenya.

Judge Reddihough, sentencing, said: 'The evidence in this case demonstrates you are a devious liar and a scheming fraudsman. In relation to Mr and Mrs Musselwhite, you preyed on their emotions and the long-standing wish to have a child.'

He added: 'Putting it shortly, in a despicable way you conned them out of large sums of money.

'All three victims have suffered substantial financial loses which they could ill afford and their victim impact statements indicate the worry, upset and anguish you have caused to them by the very serious breaches of trust.'

DiCaprio, who wore a blue short-sleeved shirt and jeans, was sentenced to 18 months for two charges relating to the baby scam and two years for two charges relating to the property scheme, to run consecutively for a total of three and a half years. The Musselwhites declined to comment after the hearing.
