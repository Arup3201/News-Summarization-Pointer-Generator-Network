A seven-year-old boy is in a comatose-state after being pulled from the deep-end of a swimming pool without a pulse during his first holiday abroad.

Doctors spent 30 minutes reviving lifeless Callum Wingate, a basic swimmer, who slipped into the two metre area of the pool while his mother Lorraine Wingate, was distracted.

The tragedy struck on day one of the family’s first holiday abroad in Playa Blanca in Majorca after flying out on July 28.

The schoolboy had been at the bottom of the water for several minutes when he was pulled out by his father Robert Wingate, who described him as ‘lying there dead’.

Mr Wingate and his wife Lorraine are now keeping vigil at his bedside at Leeds General Infirmary since he was flown home around two weeks ago.

Callum has already defied Spanish doctors who told his parents that they were ‘bringing him home to die’.

Mrs Wingate, a childminder, said: ‘It still seems like a nightmare and at some point I’m going to wake up. 

‘He’s an amazing kid - giving, generous, he doesn’t think of himself. He loves learning, he loves fishing. He loves life.

‘I miss him. I know he’s here but I miss his laugh, I miss his cuddles.’

Mr Wingate added: ‘He’s fighting. We have got to believe he can get better.’

The accident happened at around 8am on the first morning of the family holiday, when Callum, had been playing in a shallow part of the pool.

It is thought he slipped into the deeper water - more than two metres deep - while mum Lorraine, 35, was distracted.

She assumed he had walked off with his 13-year-old brother Robert, but was alerted several minutes later by her other son, James, 12, who spotted Callum’s lifeless body at the bottom of the pool.

Mr Lingate, 48, jumped in to pull him out, but he was not breathing.

Mrs Lingate said: ‘He was just pure blue. He was dead.

Mr Lingate added: ‘You can’t describe what it’s like to see your bairn lying their dead.’

After being revived, Callum spent 12 days in a Spanish hospital before being flown home to the UK.

Mrs Lingate added: ‘They told us we were bringing him home to die.

‘As long as he’s alive, I know I can deal with whatever else is wrong with him.’

Callum, who is effectively comatose, has regular spasms and is likely to have suffered long-term brain damage.
