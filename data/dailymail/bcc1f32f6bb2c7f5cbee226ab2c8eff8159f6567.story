He is known for testing audiences with his audacious and risqué jokes.

But comedian Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown’s own sense of humour was pushed to its limit when he picked up a parking ticket in a hospital car park while giving a donation to its cancer unit.

The comic returned to his car after handing over a £5,000 cheque to the Endeavour Unit at the James Cook University Hospital to find a £50 penalty notice on the windscreen.

Brown, whose real name is Royston Vasey, was handed the fine by private company Carillion even though he had been given permission to park where he did.

Embarrassed hospital staff later said that the information had not been passed to the company.

The South Tees Hospital Trust yesterday apologised to the comedian, adding that he found the incident ‘highly amusing’.

He was making the personal donation to the cancer unit after being treated there for throat cancer a decade ago.

Laughing off the fine, a spokeswoman for Brown said: ‘Roy reckons it must have been the same guy who put a parking ticket on the Queen’s Rolls Royce outside Buckingham Palace.’

Dr Clive Peedell, a cancer specialist at the hospital, wrote on Twitter: ‘Big thanks to Roy Chubby Brown for donating £5,000 to our cancer centre. Apologies for parking ticket, Roy!’

The parking ticket follows a £30 fine that was handed to the entertainer last month when he was filmed reading a newspaper while driving his Lexus.

Video footage showed Brown driving the car with the newspaper spread across his steering wheel.

He pleaded guilty by post to driving without due care and attention at Northallerton Magistrates’ Court.

The Daily Mail has led a campaign against the unscrupulous and heavy-handed approach taken by some of the private parking companies that run many NHS car parks.

As a result of the campaign, health secretary Jeremy Hunt promised a raft of new measures meaning that parking operators can no longer impose fines for trivial infringements.

A spokesman for the trust said: ‘Mr Vasey had permission to park where he did for the duration of the cheque presentation.

‘We have apologised to Mr Vasey for the oversight, which he found highly amusing, and we are very grateful to him for the very generous donation he made.’
