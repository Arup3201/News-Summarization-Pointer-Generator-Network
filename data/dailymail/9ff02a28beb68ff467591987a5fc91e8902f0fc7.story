Missing: Atiya Anjum Wilkinson whose fifth birthday it is today has been missing for two years

A father who abducted his five-year-old daughter has been jailed after refusing to reveal her whereabouts.

Atiya Anjun-Wilkinson who turns five today went missing during a trip to the seaside two years ago on her third birthday, High Court judges have heard during private hearings in London.

She was at first thought to be in Pakistan but relatives fear she could now be in Iran.

The girl's mother, Gemma Wilkinson, 32, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester has not seen her daughter since.

Atiya's father - former insurance salesman Razwan Ali Anjum, 27, is in prison for contempt of court several times.

He has repeatedly refused to comply with a court order and reveal Atiya's whereabouts, judges have heard.

Lawyers representing Ms Wilkinson are today appealing for help in finding a four-year-old girl abducted by her father after a senior judge lifted a publicity ban that had prevented the case from being reported previously.

One judge described the case as 'as bad a case of child abduction as I have encountered'.

Details of the case emerged in August at a public Court of Appeal hearing in London - where Anjum, also of Ashton-under-Lyne, failed to persuade three appeal judges to rule that he had been unfairly jailed for contempt.

Anjum argued that repeated prison sentences for contempt of court were unfair and served no purpose.

However Lord Justice McFarlane, Lord Justice Hughes and Lord Justice Tomlinson, disagreed and dismissed Anjum's appeal.

The judges also decided that Atiya should not be identified.

But several few days ago, Lord Justice Hughes lifted the publicity ban and allowed for Atiya's name and photograph to be published in order that it might help find the little girl.

In court, Anjum hinted that his daughter, Atiya might be living in Tehran, Iran with a former girldfriend who also cares for his son from a previous relationship.

Solicitor Matthew Lord, of law firm Pluck Andrew & Co - which has an office in Ashton-under-Lyne said: 'The father has said she is now in Iran but she could well be in the UK - she could be anywhere.

'We think that one possibility is that she is in the Huddersfield area of West Yorkshire.

'We would urge people to look at her photograph and think very carefully if they might have seen her - maybe living nearby.'

Following Anjum's failed appeal in 
August, Lord Justice McFarlane said it was 'impossible to underestimate'
the impact that the 'continued limbo' was having on Ms Wilkinson.

The girl's mother told the Metro: 'With the lack of information, you just imagine the worst.

'I've had no contact with her. It must be so scary for her'.

Lord
Justice McFarlane said in August: 'This four-year-old girl has now not 
seen either of her parents for a period fast approaching two years.

'She is fast growing up with no knowledge of or relationship with either her mother of father.

'The way forward is in her father's own hands and for the child's sake I earnestly hope he will now change from the highly abusive course he has hitherto been set upon.'

Appeal judges heard that Anjum's 'on-off' relationship with Ms Wilkinson ended in 2008.

The couple had met in 2003 while on the same course at Oldham Business Management School. Ms Wilkinson later fell pregnant and they split-up before Atiya was born.

On her third birthday, Anjum took his daughter on a trip Southport, Lancashire and phoned Ms Wilkinson to tell her Atiya was in Pakistan and that she was 'never going to see Atiya again,' judges heard.

Anjum had referred to Ms Wilkinson as 'only or merely her birth mother', judges heard.

Lawyers said Anjum had been jailed for contempt - by judges sitting in the Family Division of the High Court - in 2010, then again in April 2011, then again in October 2011.

They said he was due for release in April next year.
