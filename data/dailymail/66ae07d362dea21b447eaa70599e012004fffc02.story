The family of a woman who went missing from Texas two weeks ago after returning from a two-year trip around the world revealed Thursday that she may have left voluntarily.

Leanne Hecht Bearden, 33, was last seen January 17 when she told her in-laws in Garden Ridge near San Antonio that she was going for a walk. She has not been heard from since.

The woman and her husband, Joshua Bearden, were staying with his parents after returning from their travels earlier this month.

In a statement released on a Facebook page dedicated to Bearden's search, her relatives suggested that the 33-year-old woman may have left on her on accord because she was struggling to adjust to life in the U.S.

‘The pressure of transitioning from her two year trip back into what we consider "normal" life seems to have left her very anxious and stressed,’ the statement read. ‘As a result of this investigation there is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area, and we understand this is a strong possibility.’

The local police, sheriff's deputies, the Texas Rangers, a group of friends and volunteers have spent the past two weeks scouring Garden Ridge and its vicinity in search of Bearden, but to no avail, the station KENS5 reported.

The theory that the 33-year-old globetrotter took off voluntarily has been supported by evidence found on her computers by private investigator Charlie Parker.

Garden Ridge police reached a similar conclusion, adding that they have found nothing to suggest that Bearden was the victim of a foul play.

Her husband, Josh Bearden, said that while his wife is fit and athletic, she is small in stature.

The fear is that the woman may have been bitten by a snake or got injured. 

‘Her mental and physical status is uncertain. We fear for her greatly,’ her relatives said. ‘If Leanne has indeed fled the area, she is extremely vulnerable. She left with only a few assets and is traveling very light.’

On Wednesday, the private investigator hired by the family released photos of two diamond rings worn by Mrs Bearden in hopes that someone might recognize them, Houston Chronicle reported.

‘If she's running, she might try to pawn them,’ Parker said. ‘And if someone else has them, they might try to pawn them.’

Earlier this week, Mr Bearden offered a message of hope for his missing wife.

‘Baby, don’t be scared. We’re looking 
for you. And we’re never ever going to stop looking for you,’ Joshua 
Bearden told Leanne through a TV camera lens.

Bearden
 was speaking out in hopes continued public interest in his wife’s 
strange disappearance would help his cause, since police have now called
 off the official search.

‘As far as any sort of search in the area, we’re on our own on that,’ he
 said on Fox & Friends, one of several interviews he’s now done. ‘If
 you see Leanne, let somebody know. Call the police. If you live in the 
area… could you do me a favor and check out your property and see if 
there is anything unusual out there?’

Bearden said he's still looking for his wife in the area of Garden Ridge, Texas where she disappeared and not just for her sake but also for his own.

'The second I lose my hope, Leanne is gone,' he told KSAT. 'My biggest fear is that I lose hope.'

Travels: The couple had just returned to the U.S. after their journey around the world

Police and family members are 
desperately searching for the 33-year-old woman recently returned from a 
two-year, around-the-world trip who disappeared during a visit to 
relatives in Texas.

Leanne
 Hecht Bearden and her husband Joshua traveled the world 
for 22 months without a mishap but after returning to the U.S. Leanne 
Bearden has gone missing.

The
 couple was staying with Joshua Bearden's parents near San Antonio last 
week after returning from their trip abroad when she went out for a walk
 and never returned.

Bearden, a marketing graduate, left the house in Garden Ridge on January 17 wearing jeans and hiking boots and carrying about $60 in cash and some credit cards.

She also had a red backpack with her that reportedly contained several energy bars.

'We're very concerned,' Bearden's brother Michael Hecht told WSBTV.

'She left of her own free will to go for a walk and that's all we know. We're wondering what's happened. Maybe she went for a hike, saw a nice place somewhere she could hike and maybe is hurt, or has fallen over. We don't know.'

The couple had intended to stay briefly in Texas before flying to their home in Denver to begin searching for work.

According to CNN, the couple has been married for four years.

'Her husband is devastated right now and is extremely worried. We're just trying to help out the Police Department as much as we can canvassing the area, even going father out than we think she may be. But we have absolutely no idea where she is,' Hecht told WBSTV.

According to My San Antonio, Bearden was planning to return to the home within an hour in order to take a phone call about a job in Denver.

She was reported missing by her husband after she had been gone about four hours. At about that time, Bearden's parents returned home from an out-of-town trip.

Search: Facebook pages and leaflets were set up to try to find Leanne

'We could draw up scenarios that range from the sublime to the ridiculous,' Will Bearden told My San Antonio. 'I just stick with what we know. What we know is she was seen leaving our house Friday, and no one has seen her since.'

Right now police say there is 'no indication at this time that this is criminal in nature.'

Family friend Chris Busch told the Huffington Post that all leads are being followed.

'The area out there is surrounded by very rocky and rugged terrain,' Busch told The Huffington Post. 'There are caves, cliffs and all sorts of other things.'

'The options go from a twisted ankle to a snake bite,' he said.

'Is
 it possible she was abducted? Yeah. There were two attacks on women 
recently in the area. The police are looking into those. From our 
standpoint, we are just out there trying to cover as much ground as 
possible.'

New life: Leanne and her husband were planning to return to their home in Denver and find work after their trip

The family organized 50 volunteers to search for Leanne Bearden on Wednesday and hired two helicopters, with the help of donations, to scour the area.

'Although we did not find her, we did cover a rather large area where we now know she is not,' her family said on a Facebook page started in her name.
