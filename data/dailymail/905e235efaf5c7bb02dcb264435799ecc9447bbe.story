Flying marvel: Pilot Brian Trubshaw, clutching champagne after a historic Concorde test flight in 1960, amassed an archive over thirty years of flying the jet

A huge collection of artefacts amassed by the first man to fly supersonic Concorde across the Atlantic in less than three hours has been released for the first time today.

British test pilot Brian Trubshaw created an archive charting his thirty year career, which includes a short note about its historic first flight over Britain.

The handwritten log, from April 9, 1969, reads simply: 'Type (of plane): Concorde - Pilot: Self', and describes how he took off in Concorde 002 from Filton near Bristol and landed at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire.

This blunt description was in sharp contrast with what he told reporters after landing, describing the flight as 'wizard - a cool, calm and collected operation.'

Behind the scenes there were concerns over the safety of the craft, with pilots and crew having to wear air-ventilated suits and parachutes in case they had to jump out.

His collection of documents, photographs and medals also contains all his log books covering his decades of service, which included six years of test flights before it was used as a passenger aircraft.

The late airman's job was to put Concorde through its paces, criss-crossing the globe at twice the speed of sound before the plane entered commercial service in 1976.

His work to get the Concorde project off the ground earnt him the CBE and a long-time friendship with Prince Philip.

His family are now selling his extensive archive of material relating to the dropped-nose plane including his valuable log books that cover the momentous first flight.

Concorde was the world’s first supersonic passenger jet, capable of speeds of up to 1,350mph.

The plane was a favourite with the super-rich because it could fly from London to New York in less than three-and-a-half hours.

But the planes - built as part of an Anglo-French government treaty and first flown in 1969 – were long dogged by controversy and never really became profitable.

The main problem arose from the sound of its sonic boom – the loud noise left its wake made when the aircraft broke through the sound barrier.

By the early 1970s, Concorde had been banned from flying at high speed in most countries throughout the world.

Only 20 aircraft were ever built - and these were sold at a cost subsidized by the French and UK governments to the formerly state-owned Air France and British Airways.

Development of the planes was prohibitively expensive, so its only crash – outside Paris on July 25, 2000 – sounded the death knell.

Though Concorde flew again, the cost of improvement in a post-9/11 world became too much to bear and its retirement flight was made on November 26, 2003.

The collection includes Brian's medals, trophies, presentation plaques and bowls, his Concorde flight case and hat and a Concorde visitors book signed by VIPs.

There are also scores of congratulatory letters sent to him as well as photos of Brian with Royalty including Princess Margaret and of him in the Concorde cockpit with Prince Philip.

A rare signed photo of astronaut Neil Armstrong giving the thumbs up and stood next to Brian is also for sale.

And a weather vane with a Concorde model on top that Brian attached to the roof of his house in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, for years makes up the £50,000 collection.

The sale has come about because Brian's elderly widow Yvonne has just moved into a smaller home and no longer has the space for it.

It is being auctioned by Dominic Winter auctioneers of Cirencester, Glocestershire.

Mr Winter said: 'In the 1960s Brian Trubshaw was every schoolboy's hero.

'He was the chief test pilot for Vicker's Armstrong and worked on the development of aircraft like the Valiant V-bomber and the VC-10.

'He was selected to be the chief test pilot for Concorde.

'The development of supersonic transport started in the early 1950s so by the time it was ready to be tested in 1969 it was a huge event.

'There can't be another set of logbooks post-war, 20th century, that are more important than these.'

Brian wanted to be a pilot from the age of 10 and joined the RAF towards the end of World War II, flying Lancaster bombers over Europe.

He joined Vickers-Armstrong as an experimental pilot in 1950 and 19 years later made history by piloting Concorde 002.

Star man: Mr Trubshaw's pilot's licence, which forms part of the collection made by the late airman

Artefacts: Mr Trubshaw's Concorde flight case, hat and documents including his passport, which is being put up for auction

Collector: Mr Trubshaw's log books span his 30 year career and contain details of every time he took to the skies in Concorde

Decorated hero: The pilot's long career earned him many medals, including (top left left to bottom right) a CBE (in case), a Royal Victorian Order, 1939-1945 Star, France and Germany Star, Defence Medal and the War Medal

Brian went on to test and show off Concorde around the world and in 1974 completed what is still the fastest civil trans-atlantic flight, travelling from Fairford to Maine in two hours and 56 minutes.

Concorde entered commercial service in January 1976 when British Airways flew to Bahrain and Air France to Rio de Janeiro simultaneously.

Brian ended his career as divisional director and general manager of the Filton works of British Aerospace in 1986. He died aged 77 in 2001.

Mr Winter said: 'Brian's wife is downsizing and these items have been languishing in cupboards. She couldn't take it with her and thought it would be best to offer them to enthusiasts.'

Royal seal of approval: Trubshaw's medals along with a signed declaration from Her Majesty the Queen

One of the documents in the sale is a telegram from Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace congratulating him on his OBE in 1964.

It reads: 'Delighted to see your name in the Birthday Honours List - Philip.'

Brian attempted to write a reply on the back and wrote: '... will you please thank his Royal Highness on my behalf and tell him how deeply appreciative and honoured I am of this kind thought.'

The archive is being sold on November 7.
