The offices of an outspoken Tory minister have been targeted by a home-made explosive.

Two small explosions were heard outside the Conservative Party headquarters in the small south Lincolnshire market town of Bourne between 12.20 and 1.30am today.

A window was smashed by shrapnel from one of the devices and scorch marks were left on the pavement outside the building which is the constituency office for Grantham and Stamford MP Nick Boles.

Lincolnshire Police said a 24-year-old man had been arrested and was helping police with their inquiries.

But a spokesperson said early indications
suggested the incident was not linked to any wider issues or recent 
events in the county.

One eyewitness who was woken by the 
second explosion said a firework with coins taped around it had been 
placed outside the office.

Speaking this morning Mr Boles, who was not in the office at the time, said: 'Obviously, I deplore this act of violence.

'The incident is being investigated by the police and I know that 
everyone will do whatever they can to support the investigation. 

'In the 
meantime, we should all carry on doing our jobs as normal.'

Damage: A window was smashed by shrapnel from one of the devices and scorch marks were left on the pavement outside the building

He said he hoped to learn more about the incident 'in due course'.

The
coalition Planning Minister last month criticised immigration for 
helping to fuel rises in house prices that are preventing young people 
from owning their own home.

Mr Boles told the Mail: ‘I have 
become much more critical of immigration. A very substantial 
contribution to housing need comes from the level of immigration in the 
past two decades.

Targeted: Nick Boles has recently made controversial comments about immigration and planning

Earlier
this year, he admitted he is ‘nervous’ about the impact of an influx of
Romanians and Bulgarians who will have a ‘right to a home’ in Britain.

Mr
Boles also recently caused fury among environmental protestors by 
stating building houses will create more 'human happiness' than 
preserving fields.

Mr Boles said the Government is determined to speed up the rate of house building despite opposition from country groups.

Oxford-educated Mr Boles was tipped as a potential London Mayoral candidate before being diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma, a type of cancer, in 2005.

He attended last year's elite and secretive Bilderberg Conference in Virginia and this year's gathering in Hertfordshire has been the scene of anti-capitalist demonstrators.

Locals reported hearing two small explosions between midnight and 1.30am.

The
building which is home to the Grantham and Stamford Conservative 
Association was this morning taped off with four police vehicles 
outside. Scorch marks could clearly been seen on the pavement.

One resident said: 'The first explosion was around 12.20am and then I heard the second one at around 1.30am.

'A firework with two pence and one pence coins wrapped around it had been left outside a hall next to the Conservative's office.

'When the firework went off the 
shrapnel broke the window.

'Martin
Hill who is the local leader of Lincolnshire County Council came out 
because he had a key, and the police and fire bridge were here really 
quick.'

Outspoken: Mr Boles, who was not in the office at the time, said he was waiting for an update from police

A bang and the sound
of breaking glass were heard at the junction of North Street and 
Burghley Street in Bourne.

A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police confirmed
there were no reports of any injuries and only minor damage had been 
caused.

Caroline Glithero, who lives nearby, said she heard two explosions about 45 minutes apart.

'I
heard two very loud bangs and on the second one I went to see what it 
was and found a lot of debris and a window broken,' she said.
