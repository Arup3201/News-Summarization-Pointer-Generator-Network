Gone: Rayden Bruce, pictured on the day he was born, passed away today after being mauled by his parents' pitbull

A baby boy was mauled to death by the family pit bull while police were at the home following a 911 call about a domestic disturbance. 

Rayden Eugene Bruce, who was three months old, was attacked on the floor by the animal around 8.30pm on Monday after he was left sleeping alone in the bedroom.

The horrific scene was discovered by the child's grandfather after he heard noises. The child's father grabbed his son and ran screaming from the home.

Rayden was take to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas but later died.

Police
commander Cindy Aaron told MailOnline that officers were unaware there 
were two dogs at the home in Burleson until they heard the screams from 
inside.

Four officers were on Linda Drive just before 7pm after a 911 cellphone call from the area when they were approached by Rayden's mother, 20-year-old Jessica Oxner.

Miss Oxner and her partner  Barrett Bruce, 20, who had recently separated, had become involved in an argument which turned physical.

The couple were separated as they gave statements to police. One officer spoke to Miss Oxner outside while Mr Bruce was kept indoors.
