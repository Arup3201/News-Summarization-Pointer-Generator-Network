k.d. Lang appears to have a new lady love in her life, and it is very safe to say that she is not after the singer's money.

The 52-year-old 'Constant Craving' crooner is reportedly dating Heather Edwards, the wife of Canadian oil and gas tycoon N. Murray Edwards, who is estimated to be worth a staggering $2.2 billion.

Mrs. Edwards and her husband split over a year ago, though the two are still not divorced.

Past love: Lang (left) ended her domestic partnership with Jamie Price (right) in 2012, after eight years together

Lang dissolved her domestic partnership with ex Jamie Price, who she had been with for eight years, in 2012. 

According to the online magazine Frank, Lang and her new paramour are 'often seen together, dining out at Calgary’s swell eateries, sometimes accompanied by Heather’s son.'

Page Six reports that the two 'share a passion for Buddhism and sushi.'

A lawyer-turned-financier who is notoriously media shy,  Mr. Edwards, 54, made his money through investments in Canadian oil and mining companies, owning stakes in Ensign Energy, Canada's second biggest oil services company, and Penn West, one of Canada's biggest energy trusts.

He also owns and manages numerous resorts and hotels through his company Resorts of the Canadian Rockies and is a co-owner of the Calgary Flames hockey team.

Forbes ranks him as the 859th richest man in the world.

Mr. and Mrs. Edwards met in in 2002, when she was director of communications for then Natural Resources Minister Herb Dhaliwal.

Since then, Mrs. Edwards has focused on philanthropic work, a full time job given how much money the couple have donated.

They recently gave $5 million for a 14-bed neonatal intensive care unit at the Alberta Children’s Hospital earlier this year, a cause that hit close to home for the parents as their son needed neonatal intensive care when he was born eight weeks early.

Despite their split, it seems the two still work closely on their charitable endeavors. 

Lang, a Grammy Award-winning artist, shot to international fame in the early nineties thanks to critical acclaim and album sales in the millions. 

Famous exes: Lang previously had relationships with Julie Cypher (left) who went on to date Melissa Etheridge, and Leisha Hailey (right) of The L Word

She also made waves as one of the first openly gay celebrities, proudly playing on her image in an iconic Vanity Fair cover that showed supermodel Cindy Crawford shaving the singer as she sat in a barber chair.

In addition to Price, the singer previously dated Julie Cypher and actress Leisha Hailey of The L Word.
