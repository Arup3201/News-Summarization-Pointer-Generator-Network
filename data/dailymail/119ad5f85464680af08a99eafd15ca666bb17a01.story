Cricketing great Glenn McGrath has come under fire after Immigration Minister Scott Morrison presented cricket bats signed by him and fellow fast bowling great Brett Lee to the Indian government to secure their cooperation in accepting 157 asylum seekers detained at sea for four weeks.

Mr Morrison presented cricket bats signed by McGrath and fellow fast bowler Brett Lee to Indian Home Affairs Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj when they met to discuss the deal last week.

Glenn McGrath came under fire on social media for being associated with the deal - despite having no knowledge that the bats had been presented to the ministers.

Glenn McGrath has come under fire for signing cricket bats that were presented to Indian officials as goodwill gifts by Scott Morrison before he negotiated a deal to return asylum seekers to India

'You should be ashamed of yourself lending your name to send vulnerable refugees back to their misery! Disgusted,' wrote Dame Lisa Townes in a tweet later deleted from Glenn McGrath's account.

But fast bowler defended himself against the criticism, saying he was a humanitarian - even though he had no knowledge the bat had been used by Mr Morrison.

'I do support asylum seekers & have compassion for humanity. I have always tried to help people but I sign a bat & I'm labelled otherwise?!!' he tweeted.

The signed Kookaburra bats were presented to Ministers Singh and Swaraj last week as a gesture of goodwill before the meetings with Mr Morrison, which saw India agree to accept all Indian nationals and some Sri Lankan nationals on board the border protections vessel that has been floating off the coast of Australia for almost a month.

Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee reported signed the bats as a favour to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and knew what they were going to be used for

The Daily Telegraph reported that Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee were 'happy to sign the bats as a favour to Mr Morrison, after he told them what they were for' and many on social media took Glenn McGrath's involvement as a sign of his approval of the government's hard-line policy on asylum seekers.

'Ooh Ah Glenn McGrath loves Scott Morrison Ooh Eee Brett Lee loves what we do to asylum seekers,' wrote Bec.

'Very sad to see cricket legends Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee backing Scott Morrison's policies,' tweeted Leon Gettler.

Scott Morrison announced on Friday that the Australian vessel carrying the 157 asylum seekers would be brought to Australia and so those on board could be processed, making it the first asylum seeker vessel to land in Australia since the government introduced its hard-line Stop The Boats campaign.

The asylum seekers were detained on the boat for almost one month, leading to a High Court case which sought to determine if this detention was legal.

It is believed the boat left Pondicherry in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu on June 11 and was intercepted by Australian border patrol on 29 June.
