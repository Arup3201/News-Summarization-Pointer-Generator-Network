Person of interest: Jeremiah Bean, 25, was arrested on a burglary charge in connection to the Fernely, Nevada, incidents

Detectives investigating a string of five homicides in two northern Nevada counties have made one arrest and believe all the killings are connected, including one at the interstate exit for the Mustang Ranch brothel.

A married couple was found dead Monday in a Fernley home about 30 miles east of Reno and another dead man and woman were discovered in a house a few blocks away.

Police determined those deaths apparently are tied to a fifth victim who was found in a ditch along the Interstate 80 exit for the infamous brothel just east of Reno.

‘We do believe that from talking to all of our detectives that they are connected,’ Lyon County Undersheriff Albert Torres told KRNV-TV.

On Tuesday, Lyon County Sherriff’s Office announced that investigators have arrested 25-year-old Jeremiah Bean, of Fernley, on burglary charges. He is being held on $50,000. 

According to county officials, Bean had been on parole until December 18, 2012, in connection to an earlier burglary charge. 

‘Five people dead in one morning is almost beyond belief,’ Lyon County sheriff Allen Deil said about the attacks in ‘one of Fernley's quieter neighborhoods.’

‘This is absolutely shocking to us. It is senseless. The people we have talked to, they don't know whether to be paranoid, scared to death, shocked, angry,’ he told reporters at a midday news conference in Fernley.

The first dead couple was discovered after firefighters were called to a house on fire on Jessica Lane in Fernley at around 6am Monday.

North Lyon County Fire Chief Darryl Cleveland said that someone had deliberately started the fire inside a car parked in the garage of the Jessica Lane home using paper and wood.

About two hours later, Washoe County sheriff’s deputies were called to the Mustang exit with the report of a dead man.

KRNV-TV reported that victim was a 52-year-old man from Spanish Springs, a Reno suburb.

The
victim worked at the nearby Mustang Market. The owner of the business 
said the 52-year-old man was supposed to open the store at 5am, but 
failed to show up.

A short time later, deputies responding to a call for a welfare check found the other two victims in a home on Tamsen Road within 100 yards of the house where the first two dead were found.

‘This is the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen,’ said Stacee Dickey, a neighbor of the Fernley victims. She said she was acquainted with the husband of one of couples killed and he was friendly and ‘always helping kids.’

‘Just an all-around nice man,’ she said.

Speaking to KOLO-TV,
another neighbor, Gary Dolling, described the male victim as a friendly
man who owned several acres nearby and spent most of his time working 
on his land.

The arrest was made two doors down 
from the site of the initial house fire after a homeowner called police 
about a man hiding in his garage.

At
around 4pm, SWAT team officers surrounded Bean, who initially ran out 
the back door but confronted police and tried to run back out the front 
of the garage, Torres said.

‘He had some evidence that came from 
one of the residences where we had two victims,’ Deil said. ‘He was in 
one of those residences where there were two deceased individuals and 
had some of their property when he was arrested.’

Criminal history: According to county officials, Bean had been on parole until December 18, 2012, in connection to a burglary charge   

By Tuesday afternoon, investigators had collected an ‘exhaustive list of evidence,’ he said.

Authorities were searching for possible accomplices and warned residents to be on the lookout for strangers in the area.

‘We're still trying to determine whether we have one or more suspects. There are indications there may be,’ the sheriff said.

‘What we don't want to do is establish some sense of paranoia but we want people to be aware. By all means, lock your doors and windows. ... Notify us in the middle of the night if the dogs start barking.’

Investigators don't believe the killings were gang related and there was no evidence of drugs at either Fernley home, Deil said.

Neighbors were helping provide tips to police — ‘things they may have heard during the night, vehicles they had seen,’ he said.

‘Because of the amount of evidence we had collected in at least four different locations, we are very optimistic about being able to bring this to a resolution.’

Authorities have not recovered any firearm or other weapon or instrument that could have been used in the deaths and it's not apparent how the victims died. Autopsies are pending to determine the causes of death.

Police were looking for a white pickup truck they believe the man found dead near Mustang was driving — a 1998 GMC Silverado with Nevada plates, 336-UNB.

So far, the motive behind the slayings remains unknown, and police have not revealed how exactly they are interconnected.
