Former N-Dubz singer Dappy slapped a man outside a nightclub because he feared  being stabbed after the clubber called him a 'mug' and said 'I'm going to knock you out', a court heard today.

The 26-year-old, who is on trial under his real name Dino Costas Contostavlos, is accused of attacking George Chittock in a smoking area in the early hours of February 27 at Chicago's in Chelmsford. 

Dappy denies assault by beating at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court, where he was supported by his friend, comedian Jim Davidson, who met on Celebrity Big Brother.

Contostavlos told the court he had a scar on his hand after grabbing a blade when someone tried to stab him in Nottingham four or five years ago, and was 'scared' it was about to happen again. 

'It takes one second for someone to put something in my ribcage. 

Asked if he feared he was going to be stabbed on the night of the incident, he added: 'Yeah of course, I'm always concerned about that.

'I was scared someone was going to put a hole in me.  I have had to deal all my life with people trying to cut me and taking cheap shots.

'I don't want to get stabbed. I don't want to get hurt again.'

Prosecutor Jaqueline Carey told the court the slap happened after Contostavlos carried out a 'meet and greet' at Chicago Rock Cafe in in the Essex city.

Victim: George Chittock says he did not provoke Dappy or crack a joke about the star's father being dead 

The pair were in a smoking area along with Contostavlos's minder and two of the club's own doorstaff at about 2am when he was seen to slap Mr Chittock, she said

The performer was arrested by police and claimed he acted in self-defence.

Ms Carey said: 'When the defendant lashed out, he was not under any threat or any perceived threat of violence.

'The CCTV suggests he had no genuine and honest belief that he needed to use force to defend himself.'

She said Contostavlos claimed Mr Chittock had been abusive towards him earlier in the night and repeated this in the smoking area.

Contostavlos arrived at court in a black Audi with blacked-out windows. Escorted by a minder, he wore a black jacket, white shirt and black tie.

CCTV footage of the alleged attack was played to the court.

The black-and-white footage, which lasts about 10 seconds, showed Contostavlos 'surrounded by security' when he turned and 'slapped' Mr Chittock, Ms Carey said.

The defendant was acting out of 'annoyance' after claiming he was verbally abused during the night, the prosecutor added.

'He was effectively acting in a violent and unjustifiable manner,' she said.

Giving evidence, Mr Chittock said he arrived at Chicago's at about 10.30pm with five friends and drank two pints of lager and a Jagerbomb during the night.

Jon Harrison, defending, said early in the evening Mr Chittock told Contostavlos: 'Dappy, you're a mug, I'm going to knock you out.'

Mr Chittock replied: 'Incorrect.'

Jon Harrison, representing Contostavlos, asked Mr Chittock whether he had abused his client two further times over the course of the night.

He suggested that on the second occasion, Mr Chittock was ejected from a VIP area after saying to the performer: 'Do you remember me, you p*****?'

Mr Chittock agreed he had been ejected from the area as the star had his photo taken with fans but said it was the result of a misunderstanding and he did not say anything abusive.

Asked whether he had said to Contostavlos to perform a sex act on 'your dead dad' seconds before he was slapped, Mr Chittock said: 'I would not say that, I have close family members who have died and that is not right.'

Mr Harrison asked whether he knew that Contostavlos' father was dead.

Mr Chittock said: 'I don't know anything about his family.

'I'm not a fan of him, I don't care what goes on in his life.

'His life and my life are separate.'

In response to suggestions he had deliberately intimidated Contostavlos, Mr Chittock added: 'I was not in his face. I was not in his personal area. He turned around to strike me.'

Giving evidence, Contostavlos, who gave his profession as performing artist, said he was feeling 'energetic and alive' on the night of the incident.

He insisted he did not have a 'drinking habit', adding: 'I was functional enough to go and do an amazing show so I certainly wasn't drunk.'

Contostavlos said he would not be able to drink half a bottle of vodka as the prosecution claimed. 

He said that when he arrived at the club he heard somebody shouting 'mug, mug, mug'. He added that the 'same boy' caused trouble later in the night when he refused to have his picture taken with him.  

Contostavlos said he did not hear a remark about his dead father but was told about it later by a friend.  'My friend would not lie about my dead dad,' he said.

The singer said he heard someone say 'Oi' or 'what' as he was leaving the smoking area and turned around to see Mr Chittock who stamped his foot on the ground.

'He was being threatening towards me,' he said. 'I thought he was going to hit me. He's right next to me. How can he get this close to me again?

'I lifted up my hand and tried to move him away from me. If it was an attack I would have repeatedly attacked him with closed fists'.

The court heard that a friend of Mr Chittock tweeted shortly after the incident, 'George started on Dappy.'

Contostavlos said the event at Chicago's was the first time he had worked with his personal security guard on duty and he had not worked with him since.

'He wasn't used to that level of fame,' he said.

Contostavlos said he was 'a million per cent' sure that it was Mr Chittock who called him a 'mug'.

'It was a violation,' he said. 'Tesco, Asda, everywhere I go there's always one person to make a rude remark.  I've got two kids. I don't want my two kids knowing their father gets called a mug.

'This is a stitch up. This is what's happening in this case.'

Contostavlos said Mr Chittock had been 'intimidating' and 'violating' him throughout the night.

'He could have stabbed me,' he said. 'I've been through it.  I've been scrutinised. I've been signed since 17 years of age. This happens all the time.  I thought he was going to lash out at me.  

Ms Carey suggested that Contostavlos slapped the alleged victim because he was annoyed to see him still in the club after being called a 'mug'.

He replied: 'You obviously don't like me as a person. I didn't slap him. I moved him away.'

His friend, comedian Jim Davidson, also attended in a show of support. 

Outside court, Davidson said: 'Dappy is a good friend of mine, we became close on Big Brother.

'I don't know what's happened in this case but I'm just here to show him my support.'

Contostavlos finished in second place to Davidson on reality show Celebrity Big Brother a month before the alleged incident.

Contostavlos, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, is on unconditional bail.

The trial continues.
