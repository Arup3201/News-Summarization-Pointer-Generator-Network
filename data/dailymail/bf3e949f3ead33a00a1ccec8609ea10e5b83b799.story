This video shows the moment a living horse was held down and chopped up by a mob at a bullfight who saw the chance to get fresh horse meat in an incident described as 'disgusting'.

The horse had been knocked over and injured after being attacked by a bull during a recent traditional bullfight in the town of Buenavista, in northern Colombia.

The enraged ball had run off after injuring the horse, which was then surrounded by the crowd and held down.

Shocking: A mob butchered a live horse for its meat after it had been gorged by a bull

The animal is mercilessly set upon by a crowd, who have no regard for its suffering

Some of the members of the crowd then start cutting chunks of meat off of the horse which according to the video still appears to be moving and alive.

Animal-rights activists Batman Camargo, who is a local campaigner against bullfights, said: 'This is something that should not go unpunished because we have evidence that the meat which was cut off the horse was on sale hours later in local butchers.'

He added: 'If we allow this to go unpunished, then people with knives looking for something to eat might well become a regular happening at bullfights.'

But lawyer Jose Gregorio Beltran says the attackers had not broken any law and could only be punished if the owner of the horse made a complaint about damage to his property.

And he added that it would almost certainly not result in a prison sentence.

As soon as the horse falls over, a mob quickly swarms around it, with the animal unable to stand up

Outrage: Andreea Padilla (left), spokeswoman for animal rights group AnimaNaturalis, said the mayor who organised the event 'knows how serious the incident was', while Julio Cesar Guerra (right), governor of the region where the bullfight took place, has condemned the slaughter of the horse

Quintiliano Tapi, mayor of Buenavista, who organised the bullfight claims that he wasn't in attendance

However the owner of the horse is believed to be an enthusiastic supporter of bullfights who was there on the animal to take part in the event, and has refused to complain.

Orlando Serpa, the local who filmed the incident and posted the video, said: 'Today the bull attacked a horse and people armed with knives from inside the bullfight venue chopped the horse alive in front of the whole community. The video speaks for itself.'

Animal rights NGO AnimaNaturalis said they will start legal action against mayor Quintiliano Tapi for organising the event where the incident happened.

Spokeswoman Andreea Padilla said: 'The mayor knows exactly how serious it was, after all he was present when it took place.'

The Mayor however has denied that he was there saying: 'The reality is that I was not there but we are going to follow all the usual judicial procedures and look at the facts before deciding what to do.'

Julio Cesar Guerra, governor of Sucre Department where Buenavista is located, said: 'I can only condemn what happened and I hope this behaviour will not repeat itself. The things that were done were extreme cruelty and an exemplary punishment is required.'

World Horse Welfare Chief Executive Roly Owers told MailOnline: 'Shocking and disgusting don't even get close to describing this horrific footage. I am aghast both at the butchering of a horse whilst it was still alive and at the bull attack. No society in the world could defend such grim abuse, for entertainment, for the food chain or for any other reason. The Americas were built on the backs of horses and they deserve respect, not this barbaric treatment.'

So far the people involved in the attack on the horse have not been identified by authorities.
