A family's 10-year reign of terror inflicted on their neighbourhood has come to an end as bailiffs turfed all five members from their council house home. 

The O'Brien family, dubbed the 'neighbours from hell', made residents' lives a misery ruling their local area with a campaign of violence, harassment and intimidation, police said.

Drug dealing, firearms offences and robberies linked with the family-of-five's taxpayer-funded council house in Lea Hall, Birmingham, saw police officers called more than 40 times in 10 years.

The O'Brien family have been evicted from their Birmingham home after inflicting a 10-year reign of terror on the neighbourhood

On one occasion a police officer had part of his nose bitten off by one of the family's dogs after being called to their five-bedroom home to reports of a fight.

Mother Lisa Edwards, father Lee O'Brien, both 43, were taken to Birmingham County Court along with their three sons, twins Luke and Lee, 26, and their youngest Lewis, 22.

All five members of the family were handed two-year anti-social behaviour injunctions and they were evicted from their home.

The court heard they must vacate their home by the end of the month.

Chief Superintendent Alex Murray, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Sometimes people think they run neighbourhoods - they think they can control others, they think they can intimidate.

'We have shown again that by working in partnership we will not let this happen.

'If you want to act like this then your house, your benefits and your liberty is at stake.

Rogues' gallery: Lee O'Brien, 43, and his youngest son Lewis, 22. The entire family were known to the law, and police had been called to their Birmingham home around 40 times in ten years    

Double trouble: Twins Luke and Lee, 26, were part of a campaign of intimidation that terrified neighbours

'The louder and more harmful you are the more we will focus on stopping you in your tracks. I want to thank all the officers and staff who have worked so hard on this case.

'I would also say to people in neighbourhoods where you are experiencing this type of behaviour that you should contact us as wherever possible we will take action.'

The court head in February 2008, Lee 
O’Brien Sr was jailed for three years after hijacking a lorry having 
served four years previously for aiming a sawn-off shotgun at somebody 
from a stolen car.

Drug 
dealing was also said to have taken place at the property and Lewis 
O’Brien was imprisoned for 12 months in February this year for trying to
smuggle drugs into Featherstone Prison.

In August 2010 Luke O’Brien was jailed
for five years for robbery after car-jacking a doctor driving a £30,000
Audi and at attacking him in front of his wife. He is the only family member still behind bars.

Many residents were said to have been too afraid to speak out against the family for fear of reprisals.

Residents living in Lea Hall branded the family the 'neighbours from hell' after enduring a decade-long campaign of violence, harassment and intimidation

One neighbour, who did not wish to be 
named, added: 'Everybody around here is terrified of them - they 
completely controlled this area and the police were around here all the 
time.

'Everybody around here is terrified of them - they completely controlled this area and the police were around here all the time. They really were the true neighbours from hell'

'They were forever in and out or prison and it’s disgusting that the taxpayer has helped keep a roof over their heads for the past ten years.

'They really were the true neighbours from hell.

'But we are all glad that we can see the back of them now - people were scared to walk out of their front doors and this is a nice area.'

The injunctions aim to curb their behaviour by leaving the O’Briens liable to arrest if they enter parts of Lea Hall and neighbouring Stechford.

The crackdown followed a year of work by police officers and council workers under the umbrella of a Birmingham Community Safety Partnership.

Birmingham Council cabinet member Councillor James McKay said after the case : 'This sends out a clear message that we will not allow our communities to be harassed and intimidated and this success is a reflection of the on-going hard work and dedication of partner agencies working together.'
