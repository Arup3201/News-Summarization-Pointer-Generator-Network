Outraged child advocates are blasting NORAD's new 3D Santa Tracker program because it includes a fighter jet escort for jolly old Saint Nick.

Some say the new online portrait could give kids the wrong impression about Santa Claus - associating him with the military and violence.

But Pentagon officials argue the North American Aerospace Defense Command is a military organization - its purpose is to track incursions of the airspace over the U.S. and Canada - and the inclusion of fighter jets into Santa's new digital flight across the world is a nod to NORAD's true mission.

Josh Golin, associate director of the 
Boston-based Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, says the new 
campaign is ‘reprehensible’ since it played on children's fears by 
suggesting that Santa Claus was vulnerable to attack.

‘It's a backdoor way of marketing to kids when they are not supposed to be recruiting until they are much older,’ he said.

Allen Kanner, a child psychologist with the same group, told the Boston Globe: 'Children associate Santa with gifts and fun and everything else that is positive about Christmas.

'They are associating this with the military in children’s minds. It is completely out of line.'

Amy Hagopian, a professor of public health at the University of Washington, told the newspaper: 'If the military wants to keep its ranks stocked, it needs to appeal to children. The military knows it can’t appeal to adults to volunteer. It is like the ad industry.'

The program sponsored by NORAD drew 
22.3 million visitors last year and generated 114,000 phone calls from 
around the U.S.

The
2013 video shows Santa – call sign ‘Big Red One’ - guided by Rudolph 
the Red-Nosed Reindeer, zooming over snowy mountains with two warplanes 
on either side.

‘It's still cutesy since it's for 
kids, but we don't want people to lose sight of our true mission,’ Jeff 
Davis, Navy Captain and NORAD spokesman, told the Globe.

In
the controversial NORAD video released this week, an intelligence 
officer in the operation center says that ‘intel can confirm that Jack 
Frost and the Abominable Snowman will not be a threat.’

Ground
forces report that all rooftops have been checked to make sure Santa 
and his reindeer can land safely. And if someone tries to launch a 
cyber-attack on Santa’s navigation system, the ‘anti-Grinch-viral’ has 
been put in place to monitor for threats.

The
three-and-a-half-minute clip mixing live action and computer animation 
concludes with a view of a fighter jet cockpit as a pilot declares that 
he will prevent St Nick from straying into restricted air space and 
protect him from unspecified threats.

Davis said NORAD videos had linked fighter escorts and Santa since the 1960s, but 2013 marked the first time the planes had been shown in an animated version.

‘We all know that Santa travels faster than starlight,’ an officer says in the video, 'but this is nothing that our technologies can't handle.’

The addition of the fighter jets is not the only new twist for NORAD’s holiday-themed mission this year. 

The agency has teamed up with Microsoft to redesign its Santa Track website, which went live Sunday.

The high-tech website comes with all the latest bells and whistles, including a 3D globe, a holiday countdown and interactive games.

The redesign team has added a touch function to the site, allowing smartphone users to pinch and zoom in on Santa’s destinations, according to Microsoft.

Google will be offering its competing Google Maps Santa Tracker, which made its debut last year.

It all started in 1955 when a local media advertisement directed children to call Santa direct – only the number was misprinted. Instead of reaching Santa, the phone rang through to the Crew Commander on duty at the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center.  Thus began the tradition which NORAD carried on since it was created in 1958.
