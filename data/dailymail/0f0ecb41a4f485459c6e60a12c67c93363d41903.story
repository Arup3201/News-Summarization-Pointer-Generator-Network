One serene image has been viewed by over one billion eyes, has been seen in videos of the White House and even the Russian government--the default Windows XP computer background.

Even though Microsoft killed off support for Windows XP this week after 13 years, they decided to pay homage to the nostalgic scene.

With many wondering where the image of green grass and blue skies named 'Bliss' really came from, the tech company Microsoft released a video in which they interview the photographer Charles O'Rear.

This photo called 'Bliss' was taken by former National Geographic photographer Charles O'Rear on 1996 and was made famous by being Microsoft XP's default desktop photo

This is the same scene where O'Rear took his famed desktop background photo in 1996

O'Rear drove from Napa Valley to Sacramento on an extremely busy and dangerous road

O'Rear, a former National Geographic photographer said he was driving through the Napa Valley on his way to visit his girlfriend in San Francisco when he came across a beautiful landscape with perfect grass and an almost clear sky.

In a video about the photo, O'Rear says that even though the photo appears to be taken in a calm environment, the road there is one of the most dangerous and busy roads he's driven on.

Despite the dangerous road, the image couldn't be more placid. He took his old film camera and snapped the famous photo in 1996.

O'Rear says by the time he took the picture there were a few clouds in the sky but when he first saw the photo worthy setting the sky was completely clear.

Several years later, Microsoft commissioned the photo for Windows XP, reports Time. They flew O'Rear out to their offices to personally deliver the photo.

'I had no idea where it was going to go,' ‘O’Rear said in the video.

'Anybody now from age 15 to the rest of their life will remember this photograph.' he said.

'I’m thrilled to know that people have had pleasure from looking at that, from looking that a photograph that I made.'
