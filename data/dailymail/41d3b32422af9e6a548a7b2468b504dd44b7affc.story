Alleged Sydney terrorists Omar al-Kutobi and Mohammad Kiad are being protected from other prisoners inside Silverwater Jail, after being subjected to threats since their arrival.

Al-Kutobi, 24 and Kiad, 25, were arrested on terror charges on Tuesday and did not apply for bail during a brief video link hearing in Central Local Court on Thursday.

Daily Mail Australia has learned that they are now being held in protective custody inside Silverwater, which has a long-held reputation for being among the toughest prisons in New South Wales.

A police source revealed that 'these guys are typically cared for in a different way to the general population’.

'Anyone like them, who are accused of these sorts of offences, will come under particular attention (in jail).'

Silverwater Jail - is considered one of the toughest correctional facilities in Australia - it's where alleged terror suspects Mohammad Kiad and his flatmate Omar al-Kutobi are being held until their March court appearance and are believed to have been subjected to threats by fellow prisoners since they were taken into custody

However, Correction Services refused to be drawn on the matter when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.

‘Due to legal advice we are unable to provide any detail because of privacy concerns, so we can neither confirm nor deny the claims.’

Nor would they comment on suggestions the pair had expressed concern for their safety behind prison walls or that a third party had made a request on their behalf to have them protected from harm from the general population.

Kiad and his Iraqi born housemate Omar, al-Kutobi, were arrested in their shared squalid granny flat on Tuesday, where a police raid allegedly uncovered a machete, a hunting knife, an Islamic State flag and a video featuring both the men, with one recorded making threats of carrying out a terrorist attack.

Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Kay Marenos said the brief of evidence against the men was four pages long 'but that is likely to change' and included photographs and a short video.

The pair appeared briefly via video from Silverwater Prison, dressed in their prison greens, on Wednesday. Their legal aid appointed barrister, Deone Provera, said they will be seeking bail when the matter returns to court on March 16.

Kiad was arrested on Tuesday with his flatmate al-Kutobi, just hours before an alleged plan to undertake a beheading attack in central Sydney

Kiad was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and is believed to have been receiving welfare payments

Crown prosecutor Michael Allnut leaves Fairfield Local Court after the first mention on Wednesday of charges against Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25. They have both been charged with one count of "do act in preparation/planning for terrorism act" and refused bail after being arrested in anti-terror raids in Sydney's south-western suburbs

Government investigations into how al-Kutobi and Kiad were able to reside in Australia and receive welfare payments continues. It's been claimed al-Kutobi, an Iraqi national, flew into the country on a fake passport and was given a protection visa.

All this comes amid claims, by some lawyers, that statements made by Prime Minister Abbott in parliament could prejudice a fair trial.

Adam Houda has told the ABC that 'he (the Prime Minister) wants to milk this situation politically for all it's worth'.

'He's poisoning the minds of potential jurors out there. We have rules for a reason, to ensure fairness in courts.'

The PM's office, however, insists he revealed details surrounding their arrest, with the full knowledge and consent of the Australian Federal Police.

During Question Time in parliament, Mr Abbott gave a graphic description of the disturbing video. 

He explained that one of the men made threats about carrying out an attack on Australia and stabbing victims in their 'kidneys' and 'livers', whilst 'kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him'.

The PM also informed parliament that the man on the video said: 'I swear to almighty Allah, blond people, there is no room for blame between you and us. We only are you, stabbing the kidneys and striking the necks.'

The Prime Minister read from a statement in parliament, describing information surround the pair's arrest. 'Kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him, one of those arrested said this: 'I swear to almighty Allah we will carry out the first operation for the soldiers of the caliphate in Australia'," Mr Abbott said

However, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) has also issued a statement about Mr Abbott's comments, saying they would not affect their role.

It reads: 'Given the concern for public safety that attaches to allegations of terrorism, senior government officials are often briefed on major counter-terrorism investigations.'

'They sometimes choose to provide additional information to the public as they see fit.

'The CDPP forms its own view about the evidence in any given case.

In stark contrast to the images of him in gym gear and shiny pants, other pictures show Kiad wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces

'The comments made by the Prime Minister in this case will not have any impact on the CDPP's role or function, especially as this is in the very early stages of the matter, and any jury trial is unlikely to take place until much later in the year.'

Social media accounts of one of the two men charged with plotting a terrorist attack involving large knives revealed he was a fashion-loving weightlifter with a keen eye for expensive jewellery.

Pictures of Kiad on his Facebook page, who was believed to be working as a removalist until his recent sacking, show him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as taking numerous selfies while at the gym.

In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny sparkling tight pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces.

Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was apparently studying to be a nurse.
