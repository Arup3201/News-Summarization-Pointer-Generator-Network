Victim: Frances Baird was found dead at home a week after giving evidence against the teacher who abused her as a teenager

The historic failure of our criminal justice system to properly try sexual abuse cases has claimed its first victim through the shocking death of Frances Andrade.

A solitary tragedy? It’s the worst I know of but I’m sure that a lot of victims suffer deep distress when giving evidence.

Her death throws into sharp relief the way the courts deal with vulnerable victims of sexual abuse.

The criminal justice system has to understand not only that sexual abuse can leave a deep wound, but that it will reopen when probed, and to probe is the job the courts embark upon in every such trial. So victims need expert support.

I find it extraordinary that support for Frances seems to have been profoundly lacking. The police advised her for two years not to have counselling for the trauma until after the trial.

Why? Their theory may be that, unless the pain of having being abused comes out, the jury will be unimpressed by her evidence. So she must be kept in pain.

Frances appears not even to have been kept informed of when the trial was taking place until shortly before it opened and must have felt unsupported by the system she was putting herself at stake to assist.

Guilty: Michael Brewer, 68, left, and his 
ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer, right, were both found guilty of sexually 
assaulting a former student of his, Frances Andrade, 30 years ago

Who can tell what she went through in
her own mind as she gave evidence of the most personal nature against 
an evil man? She faced allegations of lying and being a fantasist. That 
cannot have been easy.

We
thought we had left behind those dark days when rape victims would be 
routinely humiliated in court, but maybe we haven’t left them far enough
behind.

Routine: Kate Blackwell represented Michael Brewer and cross-examined Frances Andrade during the trial at Manchester Crown Court

Defence barristers routinely ask for counselling notes to be disclosed to them so that they can go through them to find any vulnerabilities – the CPS can ask the judge ahead of the trial to refuse but they rarely apply to do so and judges on the whole don’t stop them being handed over. This is the other reason why police might try to deter counselling.

I was not in court when Frances was cross-examined but her plea ‘This feels like rape all over again’ shows how agonising she found it.

Clearly Brewer and his ex-wife were basing the case on the fact that she was a fantasist and Kay Brewer’s barrister had to ask the questions, but it is self-evident how offensive this must have been to Frances and her family.

I do think that we have improved the legal system since Baroness Stern’s landmark review of rape cases.

But we have a long way to go. We need to treat all victims as gently as we treat patients and be  truthful to them ahead of a trial about what it will entail. Otherwise we risk deterring them from coming forward.

We need to discover who gave Frances the shameful advice not  to have counselling, and why the police and Crown Prosecution Service did not ensure she understood what was going to happen when she was cross-examined.

We must urgently look at how we try rape cases. It is the least that we can do for Frances now.
