An electrician who faced foreclosure on his home won $1million from the Powerball lottery because his ticket matched five of the six numbers.

Larry Chandler, 34, claimed his winnings on Thursday after buying his ticket at a gas station in his hometown of Highland.

He said that among his big plans is a dinner date with his girlfriend at Red Lobster.

Taking home the check: Five of the six numbers of Larry Chandler's lottery ticket matched that of the Powerball so he took home $1million in the payout

'It's amazing. I'm just ecstatic. You know, I've never won anything in my life. This is pretty big,' Mr Chandler said at the press conference in Indianapolis.

Though the Powerball wasn't his first time playing the lottery, it was certainly his luckiest as he had never won more than $25 in the past.

According to NBC News, his first priorities include taking care of his parents and setting up a college fund for his daughter, though there is no mention of whether or not he will try to buy back his house that he recently lost to foreclosure.

One thing that won't change is his work schedule, as Mr Chandler said that he still plans to keep his job and will be back at it Monday morning.

In the meantime, he is going to hire a tax advisor and financial planner to make sure that he does not fall victim to the perils of the newly-rich.

Another success story is that of the Thompson family in Virginia, who have
two young children, are thrilled by being one of the other $1million 
winners, since the money will allow Marvin to invest in his own business
while he continues to work as an independent truck driver.

Three other midwestern winners turned in their winning tickets, though the luckiest winners from Wednesday night's draw were two unidentified winners- one in Missouri and one in Arizona- who split the jackpot by having all six of the numbers.

Security: Amber recently became a stay at home mom to their son Hayden, 6, and Haylee, 4 months, and Marvin will continue to work as an independent truck driver

The two winners could receive a 
$293.7million share, which would be the largest jackpot prize ever 
awarded in Missouri and the second largest Powerball jackpot awarded 
nationally, Lottery officials said.

They will share an estimated $385 
million after taxes if they opt to take the prize as a lump sum, or the 
$587.5million can be paid out to them as annuities over three decades.

The
winners have not yet been identified and an additional 8,924,123 
players won smaller prizes including Match 5 Winners like Mr Chandler and the Thompsons, who get $1million 
prizes.
