Four abandoned puppies found shivering in the rain and doused with gasoline at a mobile home park in Arizona are being put up for adoption.

The German shepherd mixes were found in a grey plastic box by a resident of the mobile park in West Phoenix on Friday.

Joey Friend, who rescued the dogs, said the sight of the trembling puppies doused in fuel ‘was horrible’.

Rescued: Four abandoned puppies were found doused with gasoline

Cold and wet: The German shepherd mixes were found in a box shivering in the rain

‘They had sores from the diesel fuel [because of their] tender skin,’ he told AZFamily.com.

The puppies were rushed to Maricopa County Animal Care & Control for treatment.

‘They were cold and shivery and just covered in gas,’ MCACC spokeswoman Mellissa Gable said.

It took several baths and many hours to clean the two-month-old pups - three females and one male – according to Gable.

Left to die: The four dogs, which are approximately two months old, were abandoned in a mobile home park in West Phoenix

Terrible conditions: The dogs were found in this plastic box which was full of gasoline

'It was horrible': The puppies were covered in sores caused by the gasoline, according to the man who found them

Good Samaritan: The man who found the puppies, Joey Friend, said the person who left the puppies should go to prison

For adoption: The pups are yours for $100 each as of Wednesday

‘Our kennel staff stayed late washing and washing and washing the pups to remove the gasoline,’ said the MCACC.

After several baths, which required some volunteer overtime by caring kennel staff, they were freed from the powerfully toxic fuel which could prove fatal if ingested or inhaled.

They will be available at 11 am on Wednesday at the Under One Woof adoption location inside Metrocenter Mall in Phoenix. The adoption fee is $100 for each puppy and they will be spayed and neutered.

It is not yet known who abandoned the puppies, but according to Friend, the person should be held responsible.

‘They should be in trouble, they should go to prison.’
