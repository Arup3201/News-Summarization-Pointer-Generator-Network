Simple scrape: Paul Bales cut himself in the water while he was installing a new dock at the lake where he lives

A fourth victim of flesh-eating bacteria in Georgia lost his leg when doctors were forced to amputate it three weeks after he received a cut in the water.

The latest outbreak of the infection has left neighbors terrified to go in Lake Sinclair, afraid they'll come down with the rare and serious disease, as well.

Three other victims are recovering in the hospital after picking up the bacteria from cuts and wounds across the state. Doctors say the cases are not related.

Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old graduate student whose battle with the bacteria first drew international attention to the horrific medical condition, sat up in bed for several hours. 

She continues to recover doctors were forced to amputate her leg, her foot and both her hands as the necrotizing fasciitis spread rapidly through her body. 

Paul Bales, the latest victim, was standing in Lake Sinclair near Milledgeville, preparing to install an expansion onto his dock when he cut his leg in the water on May 1, WGXA-TV reports.

His son, Mike Bales, told the TV station his father didn't think much of the wound when it first happened.

'It was a very small cut. Matter of fact he just bandaged it up and then went and played golf for the next couple of days,' he said. 

But, within four days the cut began to swell ass the infection set in. On May 5 Mr Bales, a grandfather, went to his local hospital.

The next week he was transferred to Medical Center of Central Georgia, as doctors struggled to battle the aggressive disease.

Mr Bales is now 'resting comfortably' after a portion of his left leg was removed. Doctors fear they might have to amputate more of his leg next week if the infection persists, Mike Bales told WMAZ-TV.

Mr Bales terrifying ordeal, coupled with the other infection rates is beginning to cause panic in Georgia.

'Like, over the last three decades only about 200 cases nationwide. And then all of a sudden we've three or four in the last month,' Mike Bales told WGXA.

Mr Bales neighbors on the lake are keeping their kids out of the water for the Memorial Day holiday, terrified that the bacteria could enter their bloodstreams, too.

Outbreak: Four people have been infected with the horrific disease this month in Georgia. All infections have been as a result of cuts and wounds received in different parts of the state

Still critical: Aimee Copeland, 24, (left) remains in the hospital after her leg, foot and both hands were amputated. Lana Kuykendall, 36, (right) has just given birth to twins before she was afflicted by the disease

Don't be stubborn: Bobby Vaughn, 33, says his refusal to stay at the hospital in the first days of his infection almost cost him his life

'People are scared they'll lose limbs. Everybody in town's scared to go out on the water,' Austin Hunter, one of Mr Bales' neighbors, told WGXA.

Miss Copeland, despite her heart-breaking amputations, continues to improve. She remains in critical condition at Doctors Hospital in Augusta.

On Thursday, her father Andy revealed that his daughter sat up in bed for several hours on Tuesday.

'When the doctors put Aimee up in that chair, their expectations were to give her an hour,' he wrote on her Facebook page.

'Five hours later, Aimee decided it was time to lie down. Had she been running an Olympic marathon, I think Aimee would have experienced a record-breaking, gold-medal moment.'

Miss Copeland, at student at the University of West Georgia, was infected after she cut her leg when she fell from a homemade zip-line and splashed down into the Tallapoosa River near her home in Carrollton on May 1.

The second victim of the flesh-eating disease, Lana Kuykendall, 36, noticed the infection on the back of her leg just hours after being released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she gave birth to twins.

She has had seven surgeries to remove the infected flesh and remains in critical condition at Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina, near her home.

The third victim, Bobby Vaughn, 33, has been upgraded to good condition after doctors removed two pounds of flesh from his groin. 

He is recovering at Doctors Hospital, as well, after he cut his thigh while cutting weeds in Cartersville.

Despite the bizarre outbreak of the disease, Dr Mike Green, of Macon, said people shouldn't over-react and become paranoid about becoming infected. It remains very rare, he said.

Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.
