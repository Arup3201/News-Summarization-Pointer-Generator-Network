Rarely has the rough-and-tumble and razzmataz of college football been so brilliantly captured.

Wearing a GoPro camera mounted to his helmet, a member of the Texas A&M Aggies has offered us the chance to experience those adrenaline-filled moments just before they enter the arena to do battle.

With Kanye West's 'Power' providing the inspirational backing track in the tunnel, the red-shirted Aggies get themselves pumped up by dancing, jumping around and even headbutting one another.

Back with a bang: The Texas A&M football players run out at Kyle Field through smoke clouds as they are roared on by 104,000 fans 

Here they come: The red-shirted Texas A&M Aggies players are greeted by a guard of honour as they emerge into their recently-expanded 104,000-capacity arena for the match with Lamar Cardinals

Ready for action: The incredible footage was captured on a GoPro camera mounted on the helmet of one of the players and offered a unique insight into the rush of playing college football 

Close-up: The players dance, bounce and even head-butt each other as they get in the mood for battle

You can feel the raw energy flowing through the team as the PA announcer booms 'It is time!' and they emerge to the beat of drums, the crackle of fireworks and the roar of over 100,000 fans at Kyle Field.

Given such a dramatic entrance, it isn't a surprise to learn that Texas won the match with Lamar Cardinals by a resounding scoreline of 73-3, preserving their 100 per cent start in the Western Division of the NCAA South-Eastern Conference.
