In a season in which many big-name signings failed at Tottenham last season, one at last stood out as a player of the highest quality.

Christian Eriksen turned up late in the Spurs spending spree last summer, arriving on August 31st from Ajax, one of seven transfers designed to fill the considerable hole left by Gareth Bale’s departure from the team.

He ended up proving something more than an afterthought, however, being the player who most consistently delivered over the course of the season, despite a change of managers and playing philosophy mid-season from Andre Villas-Boas to Tim Sherwood, and his free kicks are now an established major part of Tottenham’s weaponry.

Philosophy: Mauricio Pochettino wants Spurs to play a high intensity passing and pressing game

‘I think I was a bit impressed that I could keep up that level,' said Eriksen. ’I had so many games. At Ajax, there were a lot of games but you were in and out of them. Here it’s a harder competition and it got harder and harder, so I think I impressed myself.’

It wasn’t the easiest season in which to settle. ‘We had some pretty dark days,’ he says, referring to the 6-0 and 5-1 defeats against Manchester City, the 5-0 defeat to Liverpool. Now of course he has yet another manager to impress, his third in 11 months at Spurs, in Mauricio Pochettino.

All the early signs are good. Eriksen looks to be carrying on from where he left off last season, with Pochettino’s insistence on passing football seemingly more to Eriksen’s taste than the direct style of Sherwood. In fact the Argentine manager seems closer to the Ajax philosophy that Eriksen imbibed as a youth in Amsterdam, where he trained under Dennis Bergkamp.

‘It’s leaning towards Ajax way, yeah,’ said Eriksen. ‘I think a lot of the ideas are a bit similar: that he wants to play football; if you can turn, you turn; if you can play forward, you play forward. And again it’s a bit about ball possession and structure and where you need to run.’

There is one downside to the Pochettino way: the constant pressing he insists upon requires a level of intensity in pre-season training that few of the Tottenham players have previously experienced. ‘It’s been a hard pre-season,’ admitted Eriksen. ‘We’ve been getting closer to where we want to be when the season starts. It is pretty hard. The first few weeks there were times when we went to bed pretty early.

‘Now of course you try to get used to it. There have been double sessions two times a week when we were training at 10 o' clock and then again at 4, so it’s a long day. Mentally as well it’s pretty hard but it’s fun to play football, so it’s alright.’

Famously Pochettino had Southampton players walking over hot coals in pre-season last year, though it seems Spurs’ players have been spared that for now. ‘We haven’t done that,’ says Eriksen, a little alarmed at the suggestion. ‘Only at Southampton are they walking on fire!’

Neverthless, Eriksen, like everyone in football, was taken with Pochettino’s Southampton last season. ‘I think I was impressed like everyone else. When we played against them they wanted to play football and for me personally that’s a good thing, that you want to keep the ball and create something.’

As for those Eriksen specials, the free kicks in which he now has a reputation, there has been less time to practice at present, given the intensity of the training. ‘I do spend a lot of time on them but I haven’t done it this much in the pre-season. 

On target: The 22-year-old scored seven league goals for Tottenham last season

'We are training really hard so you don’t want to load your legs too much, too early. But last year it was pretty much every day doing shooting and that is probably going to happen again this season.

‘I prefer to practice with a keeper. It’s funny to beat the keeper.’ Hugo Llloris is spared that indignity, however; a reserve team keeper usually comes out to help Eriksen. It’s a skill he developed as a youngster at Ajax, where Bergkamp was his youth team coach, although for this area of the game he had to seek help from elsewhere.

‘I’ve never really seen him (Bergkamp) shoot a free-kick. Thierry Henry used to take them at Arsenal. So he didn’t teach me anything about free-kicks, no. I learnt some from Frank de Boer. He loved to take free-kicks as well. He tried to help me sometimes.’ 

We're ready! Tottenham will hope to hit the ground running after a decent pre-season campaign

Hammered time? Tottenham play West Ham in their opening game after losing to them three times last season

New season: Lionel Messi stars in FIFA 15

On Saturday against West Ham we will get an idea as to whether the Pochettino era has begun to make some substantial differences to Tottenham. They lost three times to West Ham last season, thrashed 3-0 at home, losing in the Capital One Cup and then going down at Upton Park at the end of the season after Younes Kaboul was sent off early on.

‘I don’t know why we played badly against them,’ said Eriksen, speaking at the launch of EA Sports new Premier League deal. ‘We still had chances but we didn’ t score and they did. Of course we were a bit unlucky with the red card and everything. Hopefully, if we keep ourselves in the game, we’ll have a better chance than we had last year. Of course, they play different from what we want to do, but we will have to show we can do better than last year.’

Indeed, and if Pochettino pre-season training is anything to go by, they should at least come out of the blocks flying.
