According to the New Jersey Star-Ledger, after seeing the song written on a fan's sign Springsteen decided to play the track, dedicating it to Martin.

He reportedly told the crowd at his Wrecking Ball Tour, 'I want to send this one out as a letter back home. For justice for Trayvon Martin.'

Originally released in 2001, American Skin (41 Shots) was written by Springsteen after the 1999 shooting death of Amadou Diallo.

Amadou Diallo, 23, an unarmed West African immigrant died when he was hit by 19 of the 41 shots fired by police in the Bronx.

The officers, who were working undercover, claimed they shot Mr Diallo because he appeared to have a gun in his hand.

The 'gun' turned out to be a wallet.

He died in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building.

The four officers in the case were acquitted of criminal charges - they told the court they had believed they were in danger.

Mr Diallo, from Guinea, had moved to the United States two years before being killed.

His death unleashed cries of police brutality and racial profiling.

The trial focused attention on the issue of excessive use of force by police against minorities.

They claimed they opened fire after seeing Diallo reach for what looked like a gun -  the object turned out to be a wallet.The four officers in that case were acquitted of criminal charges.

Springsteen accused the officers of racism in the song with one lyric stating: 'Is it a gun, is it a knife/Is it a wallet, this is your life/It ain't no secret/It ain't no secret/No secret my friend/You can get killed just for living/In your American skin.'

Springsteen debuted the song in 2000, in Atlanta, Ga., and he went on to play it during his 10-show residency at New York's Madison Square Garden.

It appears on his 2001, Live in New York City album.

Springsteen is the latest famous face to make a comment on the Zimmerman ruling.

Yesterday music legend Stevie Wonder announced that he won't perform again in Florida again until the state's
 notorious 'Stand Your Ground' law is repealed.

His decision follows the outrage by other celebrities and performers at the acquittal of neighborhood vigilante George Zimmerman

The singing legend made his statement at a show in Quebec City, Canada, over the weekend. 

Principles: Stevie Wonder has announced that he will no longer perform in any state which has a 'Stand Your Ground' law - specifically Florida - in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal

He said: 'I decided 
today that until the 'Stand Your Ground' law is abolished in Florida, I 
will never perform there again. As a matter of fact, wherever I find 
that law exists I will not perform in that state or in that part of the 
world.'

He continued: 
'The truth is that for those of you who've lost in the battle for 
justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world, we can't bring 
them back.

'What
 we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our 
various countries throughout the world for change and equality for 
everybody. That's what I know we can do.'

Under the 'Stand Your Ground Law' a person is able to use deadly force if they fear their life is under threat. 

Florida officials have repeatedly said they will not consider scrapping the controversial law.

Zimmerman, 29, was cleared of the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin after a trial that divided America.

George Zimmerman is greeted by defense counsel Don West at the start of his trial in Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida last week before his acquittal on Saturday night

He has gone into hiding amid death threats.

Outrage over the Zimmerman verdict has led to an outpouring of anger on the streets of many US cities.

Black
 performers have used Twitter to express their anger that Zimmerman was 
not held accountable for the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, 
Florida.

Stars such as 
Jay-Z, Beyonce, A Tribe Called Quest and Q-Tip are among those who've 
dedicated live performances to the late teenager.

Since
 George Zimmerman's controversial acquittal, civil rights groups and 
leaders have called for legal action against the neighborhood watch 
volunteer.

On Sunday, in a 
move which could have dramatic ramifications, the Justice Department 
confirmed today that it will look into the shooting death of Trayvon 
Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal 
charges against George Zimmerman in the wake of his acquittal.

The department opened an 
investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow 
the state prosecution to proceed.

In
 a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of
 the civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for 
the Middle District of Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence 
generated during the federal probe, in addition to the evidence and 
testimony from the state trial.

Outraged: NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous (center) has launched a petition to have federal civil rights charges brought against George Zimmerman by Attorney General Eric Holder

The Rev. Al Sharpton makes a statement outside the US Justice Department in Washington, DC, July 16, 2013, calling for a federal investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.  Sharpton

The
 statement said that, in the government's words, 'experienced federal 
prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable 
violation.'

This moves follows demands from a furious NAACP for the Obama administration to intervene.

Already,
 over 100,000 people have signed up to an online petition and the NAACP 
has written a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder urging the 
Department of Justice to press civil rights charges against 29-year-old 
Zimmerman.

In his first 
public statement since the verdict, President Barack Obama called for 
calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal 
shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, saying his death was a
 tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence.

'We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,' Obama, the first black U.S. president, said in a statement.

'I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.'

Obama,
 who last year said that 'if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' added
 that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings.

'And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,' he said.

The
 president urged Americans to broaden 'the circle of understanding and 
compassion' in their communities and put some of the emotion the case 
has aroused into curtailing gun violence.

'We
 should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun 
violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily 
basis,' he said.

'We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.'

'That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin,' he added.

George Crump the family's attorney said that they will still be pursuing a civil case against George Zimmerman.

NAACP President Benjamin Jealous was unequivocal in his response to the not-guilty decision on Saturday by the Florida jury.

'We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,' NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement.

We
 will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we 
will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in 
every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its 
forms is outlawed,' said Jealous.
