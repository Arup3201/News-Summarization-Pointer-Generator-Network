A mother was left in shock after a Facebook page was created in memory of her seven-year-old son who is alive and well, and at home.

Patricia Quintana, who lives in California, started getting calls and text messages on Sunday from family and friends offering condolences on the death of her son, Javier.

Ms Quintana, in an interview with NBC 4 News, said: ‘So many people said ‘I’m sorry he passed away.’ Why? Why they say this?’

Her son Javier added: 'All the people were crying just because everybody thinks I’m dead. I feel scared.’

Ms Quintana went online and was shocked to discover Facebook pages created in her son’s memory featuring photos and a video of him dancing at school.

Almost 8,000 people had ‘liked’ one page with 10,000 more liking the main picture.

The Huffington Post reported that some people realised the page was a hoax, but in a strange turn of events, the About section was updated to say Javier was in hospital, which was also a lie.

This was one of the hoax Facebook pages set up in memory of seven-year-old Javier

Ms Quintana, who does not own a computer, filed a police report, and investigators soon discovered the pages had been created as some kind of joke.

The OC Register reported that a 14-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy who used to be in the same day care as Javier were responsible for the Facebook page.

Police Sergeant Jeff Stuart told the paper the boy had asked the girl if she knew how Javier was, and she replied that he had been killed in a car accident as a joke.

Almost 8,000 people liked the page and many left messages of sympathy

The boy then ‘took it upon himself’ to create the memorial page.

When the girl saw it, she messaged the boy to take it down but he did not respond.

Police Sgt Jeff Stuart told the newspaper: ‘It doesn’t look like there was any criminal intent.’

The incident has left seven-year-old Javier in a state of confusion.

The Huffington Post reported him saying: ‘I am alive and I’m fine… I don’t know why they put it, but I just feel bad for that.’
