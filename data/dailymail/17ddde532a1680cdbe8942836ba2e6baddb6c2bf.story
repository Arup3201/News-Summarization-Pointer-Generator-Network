Most people think of the white, glittering suit that he wore on stage when they think of Elvis Presley's clothes.

But a US army uniform worn by the rock legend during his extraordinary enlistment in the 1950s has now emerged for sale for £13,000.

The three-piece uniform belonged to the King while on draft in Germany, where he spent two years serving as a regular soldier.

Experts have described the dress outfit as one of the most collectable Elvis items in the world.

Elvis was one of the world's biggest stars when he accepted national conscription to the US army in 1958 aged 21.

Incredibly, he turned down the chance to join the Special Services division and perform at bases around the world in favour of becoming a private with no special treatment.

Private Presley was assigned to the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, and shortly after arriving moved out of barracks into the luxury Hotel Grunewald.

Following Elvis' death in 1977 the uniform was passed on to his cousin Patsy Presley, who has kept in pristine condition

He spent two years overseas before being honourably discharged as a sergeant in 1960.

During his time with the army he was introduced to karate, which would famously become part of his stage routines, and also met his future wife Priscilla.

He flew back to the US on March 2, stopping to refuel in Scotland, the only time he would set foot on UK soil.

During his conscription Elvis had ten top 40 hits including A Big Hunk o' Love and Hard Headed Woman.

Following Elvis' death at his Graceland home in 1977 the uniform was passed on to his cousin Patsy Presley, who has kept in pristine condition.

The summer dress greens outfit comprises of a jacket, size 38S, 29ins by 32ins trousers and a size 7 hat with his name and conscription number printed on the inside.

The uniform, worn for formal occasions, is expected to sell for upwards of 13,000 pounds.

Garry Shrum, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'It was a real shock when Elvis was drafted into the army, especially as he chose to enlist as a regular soldier rather than in Special Services entertaining troops.

'Elvis spent two years serving in Germany, something you can't imagine today's music and film icons doing.

'He was one of the world's biggest stars at the time and he instantly became the US army's most famous soldier.

'This uniform is his summer dress greens which he would have worn for official occasions like assemblies, ceremonies or meeting dignitaries.

'When he died it was passed on to his first cousin Patsy Presley who has kept hold of it up until now.

'His army uniform is a very special piece of rock and roll history, and comes with a full dose of mojo.

'This uniform is definitely in the top ten most desirable Elvis collectors' items in the world.

'It's going to be a very exciting auction.'

The sale will take place at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on August 10.
