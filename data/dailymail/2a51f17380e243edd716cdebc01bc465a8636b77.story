Paramedics were told they could not rush to the aid of a BBC staff member who appeared to be having a cardiac arrest in the newsroom because of strict rules designed to regulate on-screen behaviour, it has been reported.

When the paramedics reached the newsroom at Broadcasting House in London after a 999 call about a worker who was believed to be seriously ill, it is claimed that security denied them access because they would have been seen by viewers in the large open plan space, forcing the stricken journalist to make his way to them.

The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has now made a complaint to senior BBC management about the incident.

Insiders at the BBC say paramedics were prevented from reaching a seriously ill journalist in the newsroom by strict on-screen rules

Sue Harris, of the NUJ, said: 'The member of staff had to struggle out of camera shot to get to the paramedic as the crew weren’t allowed to walk across the newsroom to them because of their high-vis jackets.

'This cannot be allowed to happen again. A more sensible solution has to be found, such as putting screens up. Fortunately on this occasion the person in question was not critically ill, but the BBC cannot let petty rules potentially put lives in danger.'

A spokesman for the BBC denied that emergency services were hindered and insisted the patient walked to reception.

He said there was 'no ban on medical staff attending to patients in the newsroom'.

There are reported to be wider concerns among BBC staff about strict guidelines over their behaviour in the newsroom.

Rumblings: There are also reports that BBC workers are unhappy with strict instructions dictating how they should behave

When it opened in March, the 3,000 journalists who work there were issued with a list of guidelines, including avoiding large gatherings, clearing away coats and avoiding bright or garish items of clothing. They were also given maps of the newsroom floor, showing them where to walk to avoid being caught on camera.

The BBC spokesman told the Daily Telegraph that guidance 'was issued to staff working in the transmission area ahead of the first live broadcast', adding that wearing high-visibility clothing, congregating directly behind the live shot or eating at desks was discouraged, but not banned.

Insiders quoted by the paper also claim that staff have been tasked with monitoring what appears on screen and issuing instructions to colleagues, including 'stop yawning' and 'put that sandwich down'.

One BBC member of staff said: 'There are signs everywhere warning staff they could be on camera.

'Some people find it an intrusion, particularly the older hands, but for anyone in their 20s starting out in broadcast journalism its just the reality of life.'
