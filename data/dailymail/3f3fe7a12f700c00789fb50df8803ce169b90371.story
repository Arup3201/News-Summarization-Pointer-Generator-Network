Ian Forman was described as 'evil' by a judge after a court heard of his plans to blow up mosques in Merseyside

A racist Nazi fanatic who plotted to blow up mosques with home-made gunpowder is facing life in jail.

Ian Forman, 42, whose obsession with Hitler and extreme right-wing ideology saw work colleagues nickname him ‘Adolf’, secretly made a bomb in his bedroom at his parents’ home, where he also kept an SS uniform.

The would-be terrorist, a receptionist at a recycling factory, had made a file of mosques near his home in Merseyside which he referred to as his ‘dreck ziel’ – a German phrase meaning ‘dirt target’.

Forman, who had learned how to make bombs on the internet, was condemned by a judge as evil after being found guilty of planning acts of terrorism.

Kingston Crown Court was told that a list of targets found on Forman’s home computer included the Wirral Islamic Centre and the Penny Lane Mosque in Liverpool.

Police were alerted when horrified colleagues discovered he had been researching how to obtain dangerous chemicals on the internet at work.

His home in Birkenhead was raided on June 6 last year, with officers finding more than a kilogram of gunpowder and a home-made explosive device in a briefcase hidden in his bedroom cupboard.

Under his bed they found containers of sulphur, potassium nitrate and charcoal – the three components of gunpowder.

Fanatic Ian Forman boasted about making a pilgrimage to Hitler's Berghof mountain retreat

Crown prosecutor Annabel Darlow told the court: ‘Ian Forman is a deeply racist man who has fervently embraced extreme right-wing ideology.

‘His ultimate goal was to create explosive devices that could be used as part of acts of terrorism against one of those sections of society who were different in race and religion to himself and represented the object of his hatred.’

Miss Darlow said Forman, a former admin worker at a Jobcentre, told police he was using the chemicals to make fireworks.

But when police seized his computer and mobile phone, his emails and internet history uncovered his true motive.

Miss Darlow added: ‘They were not a random collection. They are chemicals which when mixed together create gunpowder.’

Forman was found guilty on one count 
of engaging in conduct for the preparation of terrorist acts and will be
 sentenced next month.

The jury was told that Forman became notorious at Recresco, a glass recycling plant, for his racist and extreme right-wing views, and that he had boasted on Facebook about making a pilgrimage to  Hitler’s wartime headquarters in Germany in 2012.

In a text message to a friend he said he was making an explosive with ball bearings and nails, and added: ‘It might be destined for the Muslim centre in Birkenhead.’

In another, he said Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik was his ‘hero’ and added: ‘Time to start blowing them up.’

He also made a racist video featuring pictures of people in Muslim dress and searched on YouTube for videos of ‘killing Muslims’.

Forman, who has a degree in German and Spanish from Liverpool John Moores University, is understood to have been operating alone rather than as part of a group.

Judge Paul Dodgson said: ‘The defendant had, in my judgment, very extreme and evil thoughts – I think the word evil is appropriate.

‘He had the intention of carrying those evil thoughts out.

‘For his sentencing there must be a message sent out by the court that this behaviour is regarded with extreme gravity.’

A former friend told the Daily Mail: ‘He was a very friendly, well-liked person. But he was a bit vulnerable and could be easily influenced by others.’

Forman is married but lived apart from his wife at the time of the offences.
