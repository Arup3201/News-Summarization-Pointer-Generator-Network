Britain could take back powers from the European Union covering immigration, tourism, benefits and trade, it emerged today.

Ministers revealed the latest shopping list of policy areas which could be returned from Brussels as part of David Cameron’s plan to negotiate a new EU deal before holding an in-out vote.

It includes suggesting that tighter immigration controls are need to maintain public confidence in the welfare state and questioning whether EU trade policy deters investment in the UK.

David Cameron has insisted he wants Britain to remain in the EU, but only if his review and renegotiation secures a better deal with Brussels

The Prime Minister set up the Balance of Competences Review to examine which EU rules Britain should consider withdrawing from.

After taking evidence from a wide range of pro- and anti-European bodies and experts, the government hopes to use it as proof that many edicts from Brussels are not working.

However has been largely dismissed by other EU countries, raising doubts about what concessions – if any – Mr Cameron will be able to secure.

Mr Cameron wants the review to ‘give everyone the opportunity to make their points about which areas of European endeavour are in our interest and which are not’.

The latest stage plank of his Europe strategy comes after a tumultuous week for the Prime Minister, who last night saw 114 Tory MPs condemn him for not including an EU referendum in the Queen's Speech.

Today Tory MP James Wharton won the backbench draw to take legislation through Parliament, and vowed to try to enshrine an in-out vote into law.

It came as the Home Office, HM Treasury, Ministry of Justice, Department for Business and Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued a call for evidence on areas of policy and its impact on the UK.

They cover the free movement of goods and people, asylum and immigration, family law.

One of the most contentious areas has been access to benefits for newcomers to Britain.

A raft of EU rules are to be reviewed by the UK government to see if they benefit Britain or hold back growth

The Home Office review published today states that access to social security benefits for people from outside the UK is ‘inevitably a controversial matter’.

The government used the Queen’s Speech to promise tougher curbs on access to housing, out-of-work benefits and healthcare, but ministers admit they are hamstrung by some EU rules.

The Home Office highlights in its review fears that allowing people to move around the EU could be having a ‘disproportionate impact on the social security systems of some member states’.

Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘The result of the reports will be a comprehensive, thorough and detailed analysis of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK on the issues of asylum and immigration, and free movement of persons.

‘It will aid our understanding of the nature of our EU membership and it will provide a constructive and serious contribution to the wider European debate about modernising, reforming and improving the EU.’

Immigration minister Mark Harper said the review would pinpoint ways to 'modernise and improve' the EU  French President Francois Hollande has ruled out allowing Britain to renegotiate its membership

The review of family law includes the powers to resolve disputes where a parent takes a child to another part of the EU without the other parent’s consent.

It also covers claiming maintenance payments from estranged fathers who move to a different member state.

The culture review questions the effectiveness of heritage programmes masterminded by Brussels and whether the involvement of the EU in tourism policy makes it harder for countries to compete for visitors.

Trade experts are asked by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about the benefits of EU’s trade policy benefits and whether Britain  succeeds in curbing the protectionist instincts of other member states.

However French President Francois Hollande has made clear he will not allow Britain to renegotiate new membership terms.

‘To repatriate [powers]? Usually when a country commits, it is for life,’ he said last year.

‘I believe that treaties are meant to be complied with. This discussion could take place, but Europe is not a Europe in which you can take back competences. It is not Europe à la carte.’
