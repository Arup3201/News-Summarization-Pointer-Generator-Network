Jerquan Dickson, 22, has been charged with felony aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person

A Pennsylvanian man has been charged in connection with the shooting of a teenager who allegedly threw snowballs at his car.

Jerquan Dickson, 22, of York was arrested on Saturday afternoon after being accused of shooting the 15-year-old boy in the right arm and left thigh.

Dickson has been charged with felony aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person. He was later freed on $150,000 bail.

The unnamed 15-year-old was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries.

A witness told police that he saw Dickson follow a group of juveniles running down an alley and that one of them had a snowball.

The witness then said he heard at least six gunshots and Dickson emerge from the alley and get into the driver's seat of a maroon sedan and speed off, reports FOX43.

Dickson was picked up by police a short time later and he confirmed that he had followed the group of kids after his car was hit by snowballs.

Police say Dickson claimed he fired a warning shot into the air and then several more shots into the snow toward the teenager and his friends. 

After obtaining a search warrant, police searched his home and found a 9 mm Smith and Wesson in a laundry basket, documents state. Six 9 mm shell casings were also found in the alley where the boy was shot.
