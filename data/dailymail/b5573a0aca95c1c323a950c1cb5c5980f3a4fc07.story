Chris Froome lost his Criterium du Dauphine lead to Alberto Contador as the Brit cyclist surrendered a 12-second advantage to his Spanish counterpart.

The Tour de France champion held the lead despite a crash on Friday, but wound up eight seconds adrift of Contador after a late surge, as Dutchman Lieuwe Westra won stage seven.

Froome and Contador found themselves in a 10-strong pursuing Westra up top, with Russian duo Yuriy Trofimov and Egor Silin in second and third.

Finishing line: Contador wound up crossing the line with an eight-second lead over Froome during stage seven

Froome was forced to ride flat-out to respond after Contador went for it with two kilometres to go.

He limited the damage but could do little to prevent Contador storming to an eight-second lead in the overall standings, depriving him of the yellow jersey.

American Andrew Talansky, fifth in the stage with Froome seventh, lies third overall for Garmin-Sharp.

Belkin's Wilco Kelderman was the only other man within a minute of Contador.
