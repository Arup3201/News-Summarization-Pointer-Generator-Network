Jay-Z could be set to sell his small share in the Brooklyn Nets as he aims to focus on his new sports management company Roc Nation Sports.

The company announced it had signed four time Silver Slugger Award winner Robinson Cano as its first client last week with Jay-Z in the process of obtaining his National Basketball Players Association certificate as a fully fledged agent.

But the move into sports management would require him to sell his small share in the NBA side and the $1billion Barclays Center.

The rapper, real name Shawn Carter, reportedly owns just one fifteenth of one per cent of the team.

But he was a key figure in the Nets'
move from New Jersey to Brooklyn and he modelled the team's new uniform
for the first time in a concert last autumn.

Cano, a player on the Yankees' 2009 
World Championship series team and two-time Gold Glove Award winner, 
announced he had fired his agent Scott Boras and signed with Jay-Z's 
company last Tuesday.

'At this point in my career, I am ready to take a more 
active role in my endeavors both on and off the field,' Cano said.

'I am
confident that the pairing of Roc Nation Sports and CAA Sports will be 
essential in helping me accomplish my short- and long-term goals. I am 
making this important decision now so I can keep my focus on helping the
Yankees succeed in 2013, while minimizing any distractions for me and 
my teammates.'

The new agency will be co-led by Jay-Z and president Juan Perez.

Should the rap mogul want to represent basketball player, he'll have to give up his stake in the Brooklyn Nets

They've partnered with CAA sports to chart Cano's career, the New York Post reported.

'Because
of my love of sports, it was a natural progression to form a company 
where we can help top athletes in various sports the same way we have 
been helping artists in the music industry for years,' Jay-Z said.

According to reports, selling his stake in the team could see Jay-Z make a substantial loss.

He is said to have invested $1million initially, but his current stake is said to only be worth around $355,000 based on projections.

As the New York Times reported, Cano is viewed by many as the best Yankee. 

His career batting average is .308 and he his 196 hits last season included 33 home runs and 48 doubles.

He could be the player the team builds around as other stars age.
