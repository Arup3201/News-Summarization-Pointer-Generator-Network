Arsenal duo Aaron Ramsey and Calum Chambers have been enjoying some downtime during the international break.

Chambers returned from England duty to watch musician Ed Sheeran live at the O2 on Wednesday.

The Gunners defender, who arrived at the Emirates from Southampton in a £12million deal during the summer, posted a picture of himself in the stands and commented on Instagram: 'Great time at Ed Sheeran last night! What a performer.'

The 19-year-old played the full ninety minutes in last week's victories over San Marino and Estonia. 

Meanwhile, Chamber's Arsenal team-mate Aaron Ramsey was in Rome last week.

The midfielder - who missed Wales' Euro qualifiers against Bosnia and Cyprus with a hamstring injury but will be back in training for Arsenal next Monday - met three star Michelin chef Heinz Beck in the Italian capital on Saturday.

The Welshman also went on Instagram to post a picture of himself posing with Beck and gave the chef a glowing recommendation.

'A pleasure to meet Heinz Beck,' said Ramsey. 'Incredible food, worth visiting him if you're ever in Rome.'

Ramsey was't the only footballer to pay Beck a visit last week. According to the chef's Facebook page, on-loan Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard also went to his 'La Pergola' restaurant last Friday.
