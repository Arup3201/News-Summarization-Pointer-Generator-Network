Not content with spending $2bn on virtual reality company Oculus this week, Mark Zuckerberg has revealed that Facebook's future is even more sci-fi.

In a post he revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries.

He has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to 'the next 3 billion people' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time.

Mark Zuckerberg said that drones, satellites and laser are being used in Facebook's labs to beam the internet to underdeveloped countries

'For suburban areas in limited geographical regions, we’ve been working on solar-powered high altitude, long endurance aircraft that can stay aloft for months, be quickly deployed and deliver reliable internet connections.

'For lower density areas, low-Earth orbit and geosynchronous satellites can beam internet access to the ground.

'For all of these systems, the team is looking at Free-space optical communication, or FSO, is a way of using light to transmit data through space using invisible, infrared laser beams.'

'In our effort to connect the whole world with Internet.org, we've been working on ways to beam internet to people from the sky,' he wrote.

'Today, we're sharing some details of the work Facebook's Connectivity Lab is doing to build drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone.

'Our goal with Internet.org is to make affordable access to basic internet services available to every person in the world.'

'We've made good progress so far.

'Over the past year, our work in the Philippines and Paraguay alone has doubled the number of people using mobile data with the operators we've partnered with, helping 3 million new people access the internet.'

However, he admitted that new technology was the key to expanding the internet's reach.

'We're going to continue building these partnerships, but connecting the whole world will require inventing new technology too.

'That's what our Connectivity Lab focuses on, and there's a lot more exciting work to do here.

'Our team has many of the world's leading experts in aerospace and communications technology, including from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab and Ames Research Center.'

The Zephyr High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that flew for 54 hours. Facebook today revealed it has hired key staff from the project.

Power: Titan Aerospace's drone is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity - it flies above the clouds, so it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours.

Wingspan and payload: 60 metres wide. The Solara 60 carries a payload of 250 pounds.

Speed: Cruising speed for the Solara is about 65 mph.

Function: The drone can be used for surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight - or to provide communication, which is what Facebook is said to be interested in.

Distance: The unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles.

'Today we are also bringing on key members of the team from Ascenta, a small UK-based company whose founders created early versions of Zephyr, which became the world’s longest flying solar-powered unmanned aircraft,' he said.

'They will join our team working on connectivity aircraft.'

Facebook is also  tipped to spend up to $60million on buying Texas-based Titan Aerospace, which makes drones that can fly solo for five years without needing to land, in order to bring affordable internet access to some five billion people who don’t have it.

However, the technical challenges are still great.

The Institution of Engineering and Technology's deputy president, Professor William Webb, said: 'The idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old, from low-orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles.'

In April, Google also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones (pictured) to provide similar connectivity

Facebook has a checkered
history with privacy, and many have voiced concerns about how the site could
use drones to collect data about people. In theory, the drones could be
used to take aerial images, or collect details about wireless networks and
individuals.

As Facebook's drones will be
used to provide internet to people home's, there will need to be a limited
amount of data collection to connect the homes to the network.

With this in mind, they are
likely to be subject to strict regulation.

In the U.S, for example, the
Federal Aviation Authority's (FAA) guidelines state private operators  are
allowed to fly their drones ‘recreationally’ and commercial drones are
'prohibited.'

However, earlier this month
Judge Patrick Geraghty, from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
dismissed a fine, which the FAA had placed on a drone photographer.

Geraghty said Raphael Pirker’s
camera drone was ‘not subject to [federal regulation] and enforcement,’ and
therefore the fine wasn’t valid.It is unsure exactly what this
ruling will mean for companies such as Amazon, and now Facebook, but it could
see the restrictions relaxed.

The FAA is appealing. Facebook is also
planning to use these drones in areas outside the U.S., and it will depend on
the individual country's laws on unmanned aircraft and surveillance.

'The difficultly has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost. As technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and Facebook's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area.'

He warned that there are many challenges to overcome before the dream of providing internet access to remote communities via drone can be achieved.

'Top of the list is the need to make the drones cost-effective, reliable and demonstrate to the regulators that they can operate safely in our airspace.

'Many other issues associated with access to radio spectrum, national telecoms regulations and more will also need to be addressed,' he added.
