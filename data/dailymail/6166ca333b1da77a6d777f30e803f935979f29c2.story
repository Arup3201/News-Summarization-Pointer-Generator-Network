Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has predicted it will ‘take a long time’ for local rivals Manchester City to be regarded as one of Europe’s super-clubs.

On the eve of his first Manchester derby, Van Gaal gave former player Peter Schmeichel’s assertion that City were now a bigger club than United short shrift — despite them being the current Premier League title holders.

Van Gaal claims United’s worldwide appeal will always mean they are considered a bigger club than City.

‘I think so because abroad we have more fans, and followers on social media,’ said the Dutchman.

‘It’s also the same thing for Bayern Munich being the biggest club of Germany, the same thing for Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain.

‘It takes a long time for Manchester City to reach that level, I think.’

United say that market research indicates they have 659 million supporters globally, though there is always debate about how such figures are produced.

Van Gaal’s immediate concern, though, is winning at The Etihad Stadium. Despite spending £158million on new players in the last transfer window, United are yet to win an away game, failing to overcome Burnley, Sunderland, MK Dons, Leicester City or West Brom.

The Dutchman admits he is perplexed by it as he takes his team across town.

‘There is no reason for it but they are the facts and it should not be like that,’ Van Gaal conceded.

‘The only game we lost was at Leicester and that was a special because of the referee’s decisions. We’ve drawn the other games and we could have won, it’s small margins. We only lost out in height which made it difficult at set-plays. Maybe you can advise me to buy tall players.’

So will Vincent Kompany and Edin Dzeko be a threat today? ‘City have scored only one out of a set-play, less than us,’ said Van Gaal dismissively.

Wayne Rooney will return from suspension to captain United for the first time in the derby. On-loan striker Radamel Falcao is still missing, though United insist his injury is not related to his long-term knee problem.
