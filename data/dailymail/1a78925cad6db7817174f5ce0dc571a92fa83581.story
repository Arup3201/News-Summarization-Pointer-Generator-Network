The son of a stable worker who was murdered at the Kentucky Derby believes his father's killer was one of their colleagues.

Adan Perez's body was found in a barn the morning after the famous horse races at the Churchill Downs track, where he and his son Wilson both lived and worked.

The 48-year-old had been dumped in one of dozens of barns at the back of the grounds, which house more than 1,000 horses and 600 stablehands.

'It has to be someone who lives here because no one else can come in,' his son Wilson told CNN.

He said he last heard from his father 
at around 11.30pm on Saturday night, when they talked on the phone for 
several minutes at the end of a long day at the 
Derby.

He was found dead at 5am the next day.

'He called me to see how I was doing and where I was,' said Wilson Perez.

'He told me he was outside (the racing 
grounds) at a restaurant with friends. Everything 
was normal, like every time he called me.'

Wilson began working at Churchill Downs two years ago after leaving his home in Guatemala to be with his father, who had been living in Kentucky since 2008.

'I asked him to bring me here,' said Wilson. 'I wanted to be with him.'

Most stable workers are Central American immigrants who move around the country looking for work with trainers.

They live at the back of the tracks - 
the forgotten side of the horse racing grounds, which highlights the stark class divisions within the sport.

Millionaire horse owners meet with stable 
hands who earn between $250 and $800 a week caring for the prized horses.

'The outside world doesn't see this world,' said Churchill Downs chaplain Ken Boehm. 'They don't know what the backside of the racetrack is like.'

Many stablehands move around the country, following the work wherever it goes.

They can live at Churchill Downs for free, 
but the day starts at around 4am, when some clean the stables and feed horses while others prepare the 
horses for their daily workouts on the racetrack.

Louisville police have released few details of the investigation so far.

Adan Perez worked for horse trainer Cecil Borel, the brother of three-time Kentucky Derby-winning jockey Calvin.

Wilson said of his father: 'I imagine he's wandering around here.'
