Researchers have found that the SARS outbreak, which killed 774 people, had its origin in Chinese Horseshoe bats.

Scientists discovered two SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in the bats which they claim are very similar to the virus that infected humans.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic killed around 10 per cent of the 8094 people infected in 2002 and 2003.

Diarrhoea was commonly reported among the patients and severe complications included kidney failure and acute breathing difficulties.

Scientists now claim the outbreak could have originated from wildlife markets were the bats were kept, or from someone living close to a bat cave. 

Chinese Rufous Horseshoe bats, so-called because of the horshoe-shaped bulge on their nose, are found in China, India, Nepal, and Vietnam.

The above image, supplied by the IUCN Red List, shows the Chinese Rufous Horseshoe bat's range, predominately in China, some parts of India and Nepal.

They have leaf-like, horseshoe-shaped bulges on their noses. The species send location calls through these structures, which scientists believe may serve to focus the sound.

Their hind limbs are not well developed, so they cannot walk on all fours. However, their wings are broad, making their flight particularly agile.

They are mostly dull brown or reddish-brown in colour and vary in size from 2.5 cm to 14 cm in length.

The research team, led by Professor Shi Zhengli from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing found that the viruses in these bats infect human cells in the same way.

This means that the coronaviruses could in fact move directly from bats to humans.

The team added that the Sars-like coronavirus is around 95 per cent genetically similar to the Sars virus in humans.

Previous studies had shown that the SARS virus bats carried was close to the one that infected humans.

The major difference, however was a spike protein which infected human cells was coded in a way so that it disabled the infection. 

Scientists theorised that the virus transferred to civets in Chinese markets, where it underwent the genetic changes to infect humans.

The finding, which were reported in the journal Nature, ‘definitively confirms’ bats as the origin of the virus.

Scientists hope their finding will help governments design better prevention strategies for SARS and similar epidemics.

According to the researchers, the finding highlights the importance of protecting the bat’s natural environment so they are not forced into highly populated urban areas in search of food.
