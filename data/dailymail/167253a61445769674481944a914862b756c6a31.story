Vice President Joe Biden insisted on Monday that the estimated 11.5 million people living in the U.S. illegally are 'already Americans,' whether or not the U.S. Congress passes a law providing them with a path to citizenship.

His comments at a breakfast to mark the beginning of Cinco de Mayo, an unofficial holiday that residents of the Mexican state of Puebla founded to mark their country's unlikely victory over French armed forces in 1862.

'To continue the dreams of all the American people, we have got to get 11 million people out of the shadows,' Biden said.

'It’s not just to benefit those 11 million people; it’s badly needed for the country. The country needs a shot in the arm and this would give it a considerable shot in the arm.'

Vice President Joe Biden wound up a crowd of about 100 Hispanic-Americans, mostly advocates for President Obama's flavor of comprehensive immigration reform, during a Cinco de Mayo breakfast at the Naval Observatory near his official residence

Double dipping: Protesters also flooded Oakland, California streets on Thursday with demands for immigration reform on May Day, which is linked in the u.S. to organized labor and illegal immigrant protests

Immigrant rights rallies have hit Capitol Hill, but only Democrats have embraced the idea of an amnesty

Not everyone in America's fast-growing community of Latinos appreciated the speech, however.

Latino Rebels, a wildly popular center-left English-language Latino blog, called it 'Hispandering' to likely Democratic voters.

The bloggers behind the website run a charitable foundation that aims to fund the entry of more Hispanic filmmakers and journalists into their respective industries, according to NBC Latino.

Advocates of President Barack Obama's preferred route to what he calls 'comprehensive immigration reform' generally admit they don't know for sure that the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is holding steady at 11.5 million.

Official government numbers rely on guesswork to estimate how many knowingly fill out U.S. Census Bureau forms incorrectly.

National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers chairman Zack Taylor wrote in an open letter last September that 'the more likely figure is 18-20 million and rising daily.'

For Mexican-Americans and illegal 
immigrants from South of the border, the fifth of May has become a day 
to celebrate Mexican heritage and culture.

But Biden used it Monday to call on Congress to green-light President Barack Obama's proposal that would, in the long term, give legal status to the millions who have crept across U.S. borders, jumping in line ahead of millions more who have obeyed immigration laws and waited their turns for legal acceptance.

The bill would be an economic boon, he argued, saying its likely effects 'are the exact opposite of what the right has been preaching, what the nativists have been preaching for a long time.'

Senate Democrats passed the measure last ear, but House Republicans declared it dead on arrival.

Biden also doubled down on comments he made earlier in the year which angered some in the GOP.

'I know I was criticized for saying a couple of months ago in Florida that these 11 million folks in the shadows are already Americans,' he told an audience of about 100, 'and I got pretty roundly criticized for that. But they are Americans. They may not be citizens, but they are Americans.'

'Hispandering'; Biden is a likely contender for the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nomination, and is working to publicize his bone fides among Latino voters

Obama's second-term agenda includes a total overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, a goal that Republicans in the House of Representatives have resisted

The vice president pointed to America's history as a nation of immigrants, saying that foreigners to emigrate to the U.S. have 'sort of self-selected. The best came. What we’ve gotten over the last 230 years is – we’ve gotten people who already posses in their DNA the sense of courage and optimism and movement.'

'That’s exactly what the hell we are. That’s who we are.'

Secretary of Labor Tom Perez was in attendance, along with Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Eduardo Medina-Mora, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Earl Anthony Wayne, and Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Anna Maria Chavez.

At least two members of the House of Representatives also attended, but a White House pool reporter noted that Biden publicly acknowledged Rep. Julian Castro, who was not among them.

'We share so much more in common with 
Mexico than just a border,' Biden added. 'We share values, a common 
history, and I think common dreams.'
