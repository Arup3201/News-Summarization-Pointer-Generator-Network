Toxic hip implants used in thousands of operations in Britain were sold by a company which knew for at least three years that they could be dangerous, it was claimed today.

Johnson & Johnson subsidiary DePuy advertised ‘metal-on-metal’ hip implants despite a top surgeon allegedly telling one of the manufacturer’s executives in an email that they were causing problems.

Tests found the hips failed after two and a half years far more regularly than other models - but they were continually marketed to British patients, despite them being suspected of poisoning the blood.

Dangerous: An online warning by a U.S. law firm investigating the early failure of the hip implant. More than 10,000 patients in Britain were fitted with the implants, which are thought to wear down and cause issues

Hundreds of patients are now having replacements for the hips, which are intended to last for life, despite DePuy allegedly being continually warned about their impact, reported the Daily Telegraph.

More than 10,000 patients in Britain were fitted with the implants, which are thought to wear down and cause potentially toxic metal to get into the bloodstream. They were taken out of use in 2010.

Revelations over the warnings appeared in a court case in Los Angeles, looking at the compensation of patients, in which Loren Kransky, 65, is suing DePuy  for failing to warm him the hip could be faulty.

In metal-on-metal implants, the ball and socket of the hip are replaced with metal instead of one or both being another material, like plastic or ceramic. It is deemed a failure if it has to be taken out.

Pain: Company figures showed in June 2007 that the implants had a 90 per cent survival rate after two and a half years - which was relatively low in relation to other models (file picture)

The faulty implant, known as an ASR device, was introduced to the UK in July 2003. It was one of a new generation of hip implants made from metal alone, rather than metal and plastic.

The hip was supposed to last longer and prevent patients from losing too much tissue and bone when it was inserted. It was thought surgeons began reporting problems with the implant in 2007.

But new documents alleged that Belfast orthopaedic surgeon David Beverland had been reporting problems earlier, and wrote to DePuy engineer Graham Isaac in May 2006 to discuss the problems.

The next year Dr Beverland chose to discontinue use of the implants, reported the Daily Telegraph.

Company figures showed in June 2007 that the implants had a 90 per cent survival rate after two and a half years - which was relatively low in relation to other models.

But the firm looked at a new method for marketing the product with different data in March 2008 that gave a 99 per cent rate of success. One marketing manager called it a ‘game changer’.

Patients had started returning to hospitals in pain in 2007. A research team in Newcastle found that the metal surfaces wore away, releasing tiny particles of chromium and cobalt into the body.

These were absorbed into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues, causing inflammation, bone and tissue damage around the pelvis and, in severe cases, blood poisoning and benign tumours.

A DePuy spokesman told Mail Online: 'Let me first emphasize that DePuy acted in the best interests of patients in deciding to voluntarily recall the ASR Hip System and in creating a program to address patient medical costs directly associated with the recall.

'DePuy believes the evidence will show the company acted appropriately and responsibly. At all times the company was looking out for patient interests by analyzing data on the ASR Hip System.'

In February 2012 year the Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  issued an alert to the NHS on a 
wide range of 'metal on metal' implants, saying there was a ‘small risk’ they could cause
complications in patients.

Hip replacements involve a ball, 
socket and stem. The alert related to those whose replacements have a
ball with a diameter of 36mm or more.

Around
65,000 people in the UK have received metal on metal hip implants since
2003, of whom 49,000 were given the ‘large-head’ implants. They were told they should have 
annual tests on blood ion levels while those with symptoms will also 
need annual MRI scans.

Today, the MHRA told Mail Online: 'The majority of patients who receive metal on metal hip implants have well functioning hips and are at a low risk of developing any serious problems.

'We acted quickly in 2010 to alert healthcare professionals that patients with ASR implants need to be closely monitored following the recall of all ASR products in the UK by the manufacturer DePuy in August 2010.

'The MHRA is continuing to monitor the performance of all hip implants through the National Joint Registry and we work closely with our expert orthopaedic advisory group to ensure that patients are protected from unsafe hips. If patients have any concerns, they should speak to their orthopaedic surgeon.'
