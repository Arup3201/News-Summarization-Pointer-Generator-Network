Airport regulations saw former England and Liverpool striker Michael Owen endure his very own travel 'torture' on Tuesday.

The former footballer-turned-horseracing owner was travelling back to the UK from the US on a British Airways flight after attending the famous Santa Anita Breeders' Cup meeting.

Scheduled for a fly-in to London Heathrow Airport from Los Angeles, thick fog meant the flight had to be diverted to Manchester. 

Michael Owen, pictured at the Breeders Cup, caused a Twitter storm after complaining of his travel 'torture'

The irony is, Owen's original plans were to end up in Manchester via transfer from Heathrow.

However, once the plan was grounded in the north west, it wasn't quite the stroke of luck that the 34-year-old had hoped for.

Owen, who ended his playing career with Stoke City after three years at Manchester United, took to Twitter to inform the world of his 'travel torture' writing: 'Been told I can't get off. Got to wait on plane for over an hour to then fly to Heathrow and miss my flight back up to Manchester. #Torture.'

Owen planned to end up in Manchester but was forced to stay on the plane, fly to London and then back again

But it was his next, possible tongue-in-cheek tweet that saw him come in for criticism on the social networking site.

Owen added: 'Please BA, let me walk off the plane and into my Dads car. I want to pick my kids up from school and don't need to go to Heathrow and back.'

Conor Waters replied: 'Go through security like the rest of us,' while Barry Smith added: 'Sure there's many other ppl on the plane with same dilemmas #civilianlife.' 

Owen spent three years at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson before finishing his career with Stoke

One Twitter user jokingly asked for the former Premier League forward to be left 'on the plane forever'

Keeping his 2.99 million followers up to date of how his frustrating day was going, Owen later Tweeted that he had missed picking his children up, but had managed to squeeze on another flight out of Heathrow. 

As Sportsmail's Charles Sale reported in Wednesday's Daily Mail, Owen chose to watch his horse Brown Panther run in the Breeders’ Cup meeting in the States rather than work on BT Sport’s Newcastle v Liverpool match last Saturday.

BT are understood to have been disappointed by Owen’s decision to put his racing interests before his football commitments and have made that very clear to him. So much so that if Owen misses another game in similar circumstances, there could be a parting of the ways.  

Michael Owen won every domestic trophy and is best remembered for the goals he scored at Liverpool
