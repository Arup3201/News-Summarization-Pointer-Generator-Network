A £45million transformation of the 116-year-old Tate Britain gallery has been unveiled today.

Architects have worked on the oldest part of the Grade-II listed building, reopening the main entrance and installing a breathtaking giant spiral staircase at its heart.

It was built on the site of a Victorian prison in central London, used to hold criminals before they were shipped to Australia.

Magical: The gallery's circular balcony, which surrounds the stunning centre of the building, has been closed since the 1920s but has been opened today

Magnificent: A new staircase has been installed at the heart of Tate Britain, which has gone through a £45million revamp

Other changes include a re-hanging of the
collection displays and the restoration of a mural, which was damaged 
in a devastating 1928 flood.

Parts of the building have been closed for almost two years while work was completed.

Most of the funding, 95 per cent, came from private philanthropy while the remaining five per cent was from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Tate Britain, designed by architect Sidney RJ Smith, opened its doors in 1897 after industrialist Henry Tate offered his collection of British art to the nation.

Breathtaking: Architects Peter St John and Adam Caruso have revitalised The Tate's entrance, cafe and gallery spaces, which has not really been touched for a century

Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called the unveiling, before it is opened to the public on Tuesday, 'a very exciting day'.

First known as the National Gallery of British Art, Tate Britain, on the bank of the Thames, first opened in 1897.

Sir Henry Tate, the man who built his wealth on sugar and bought the patent for sugar cubes, donated cash and art for it.

It was built on the site of Millbank Prison, which was most famous for holding prisoners before they were shipped to Australia.

It houses a priceless collection, including a huge number of works by J. M. W. Turner, William Hogarth, Thomas Gainsborough and John Constable, including his famous Flatford Mill painting, above.

Modern artists like David Hockney and Francis Bacon are also among the famous artwoks on display.

He added: 'Between 1960 and 1990, people felt apologetic about this building. They felt the need to lower the heights of ceilings and introduce false walls. Since 1990 we have been steadily opening up the galleries.

'What you see today is essentially the realisation that the building itself can be used in many different ways and artists can respond to it in a way that would have been unforeseen 30 or 40 years ago.'

He said that the belief, held recently, that a gallery had to look like a white cube to show off work properly 'had changed for the better'.

'In the 1960s, artists, architects and museum curators felt that they needed to create what they regarded as neutral spaces.... We've gone back to museums in a way that they're designed to be seen,' he said.

Tate Britain director Penelope Curtis said that the building had 'regained its logic and symmetry' thanks to the refurbishment, which was 'essentially on time and on budget'.

She said that the history of the site, from 'swamp, to penitentiary to art gallery', was now at the heart of the building.

She added that they had 'rediscovered the beautiful original features of parts of the building' and that Sidney Smith was 'a better architect than many people recognised'.

Architects Adam Caruso and Peter St John said that today's generation was less interested in dismantling the old, adding that despite the British construction industry having a chequered reputation, they were 'extremely proud' of the quality of the work.
