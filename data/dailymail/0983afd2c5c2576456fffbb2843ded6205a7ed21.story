One of Louis van Gaal’s predecessors at Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson, turned the haranguing of referees into something of an art form. 

Van Gaal’s Boxing Day opponent at Old Trafford, Newcastle’s Alan Pardew, has also been known to overstep the mark in his technical area in every sense.

But as much as he commands an automatic place in the spotlight, Van Gaal has been happy to spend his first five months in English football sat largely in the shadows.

The Dutchman has been conspicuous by his absence on the touchline, preferring to stay in his dug-out during games studiously taking notes.

Not for him the antics of Ferguson, who spoke once again this week about the benefits of pointing animatedly to his watch in front of match officials to give United a little extra ‘Fergie Time’ when required.

Van Gaal questions the myth. ‘You think the referee is looking at Ferguson?’ he said. ‘On television you can see that because every television station is recording the manager, I know. But the referee is not looking at the TV. Maybe after the match, but then he can’t change anything any more.

‘I don’t think I can influence the referee, no. When I was in my first year I did everything. But I learned to be more quiet. I write notes for half-time. I can say the things that I am willing to say that can influence the match. Then the sequence is always the right way because the players remember the moments of the game in sequence. It’s more efficient then.’

Ferguson clashed with Pardew when United last met Newcastle in a Boxing Day fixture at home two years ago, a memorable game that ended 4-3 after the United boss pursued referee Mike Dean on to the pitch at half-time.

Sir Alex was later criticised by Pardew and responded with his famous ‘wee club in the North East’ putdown.

The Newcastle boss is no stranger to touchline controversy. In the past year alone, Pardew has been banned for seven games and fined a total of £160,000 for butting Hull midfielder David Meyler, and warned about his conduct after calling Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini a ‘f****** old ****’.

In 2012 he was suspended for two matches and fined £20,000 for pushing an assistant referee in a row over a throw-in, having previously been involved in angry altercations with Arsene Wenger and Martin O’Neill.

Van Gaal does not see the point in ranting and raving on the touchline. ‘I have never had a fight,’ he said. ‘I only use my voice, never my hands or something like that.’

So why do other managers scream at their players, officials and rival managers? ‘You have to ask them,’ he replied. ‘I don’t have the idea that you can influence a game by shouting from the sidelines.

‘With the fans in the Premier League shouting so much, the players can’t understand you. That’s why I’m always on the bench. You have trained them to read the game by themselves. It is much more important that they are more involved with the game, that they make their own decisions. It is like a child, you educate.

‘Sometimes they can’t read that but then you have half-time or you have a (substitution). Then you can say to the player who is coming on to the pitch how they have to play in their position. You have to transfer that.’ 

United’s draw at Aston Villa last weekend ended a run of six straight wins in the Premier League, and Van Gaal’s side are now 10 points adrift of leaders Chelsea.

Jose Mourinho has lifted titles throughout Europe on all seven occasions his teams have topped the table at Christmas, but Van Gaal has not given up hope of turning United into champions in his first season in English football. He added: ‘In the Netherlands and also in Germany you have the Christmas champions but that doesn’t count at the end of May or June — then you have to be first.

‘It’s better to be the Christmas champions, then the possibility you shall be next champion is bigger — but not certain. Our goal is still to be champions at the end of the season. We are looking in a football world where No 1 is the most important thing. Our goal is to be first.’

Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand has backed his former club to finish in the top three this season after overcoming a ‘sticky start’ under Van Gaal.

Ferdinand, whose 12-year stint at Old Trafford ended in the summer, is convinced his old side’s recent revival will continue.

‘Six weeks ago you’d be thinking hopefully they’d get in the Champions League,’ Ferdinand said. ‘Looking at them now, they’ll finish in third place, definite Champions League, then maybe they’ll get one of the cups.

‘If they continue on the run they’re on, who knows? They could go into second or first, but Champions League this season would have been something they were asking for.

‘Van Gaal had a sticky start, but the lads seem to be getting a better understanding of what he wants and you can see that in the results in the last six games. Michael Carrick coming back has been a huge plus for them.’

Ferdinand also spoke of the change in his relationship with Ferguson.

‘It’s crazy. You listen to him speak now — he created that divide between himself and the players, but now I’ve spoken to him more than when I played at United. He seems like he’s really enjoying life and I’m sure he’s enjoying Christmas with the family.’
