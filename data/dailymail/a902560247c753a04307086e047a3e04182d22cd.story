Just weeks ago 15-year-old Ruta Meilutyte was sitting with classmates at Plymouth College.Today she's an Olympic champion.

The Lithuanian swimming prodigy, taught and trained at an English secondary school, stormed to victory in the 100m breaststroke final.

Nobody expected Miss Meilutyte to even reach the final and she was so shocked by her own success, the teenager held her hands over her mouth when she first clapped eyes on the scoreboard.

When the BBC approached her for an interview poolside, the shaken Miss Meilutyte told retired British swimmer Sharron Davies: 'I can't believe it. It's all too much for me. I just can't believe it.'

The 15-year-old not only became the first swimmer from her country to win an Olympic medal she did it in under extraordinary circumstances.

The start, a time when swimmers are already battling their nerves, was delayed by a technical malfunction that saw the starter's gun go off before he had called 'on your marks'.

American Breeja Larson dived into the pool on the gun but was able to race because of the malfunction.

The eight finalists sat down while the problem was fixed and an unfazed Miss Meilutyte still got off the blocks fastest and led at the turn but then had to survive a fierce challenge from American Rebecca Soni, the reigning world champion in the event.

The more experienced Miss Soni drew level in the final few strokes but Miss Meilutyte kept her cool and got her hands on the wall first in one minute, 05.47 seconds.

Miss Soni was second in 1:05.55 while Japan's Satomi Suzuki finished third in 1:06.46.

Australia's
 Leisel Jones, the defending Olympic champion who won a silver medal at 
the 2000 Sydney Games when she was 15, finished fifth overall in her 
fourth and final appearance at the Games.

The
 only person who won't be surprised by Miss Meilutyte's gold medal is 
Jon Rudd, her coach at the internationally acclaimed Plymouth Leander 
Swimming programme.

Speaking before the final, Rudd, who describes his pupil as 'super human', told the Plymouth Herald: 'The only limit to what she is capable of achieving is herself.

'There are girls out there with long standing experience and they are going to bring that to the final.

'But what Ruta (left) brings is youth and vibrancy. She is not worried about reputations.

'She has already achieved her ambition by reaching the semi-finals.'

She wasn't the only teenage success story at the aquatics centre last night,.

Missy Franklin started a fantastic night in the pool for Team USA, claiming the first of two golds when she stormed to victory in the 100m backstroke final.

The 17-year-old, competing in seven events at her first Games, overhauled Australia's Emily Seebohm in the final few strokes, to win her first individual medal of London 2012.

The night quickly got better for the American team when Matt Grevers and Nick Thoman powered to a gold and silver one-two in the men's 100m backstroke.

The jubilation made up for Ryan Lochte's disappointment earlier in the night.

The heavily fancied 27-year-old crashed out of the medal positions during a scintillating 200m freestyle final, which was won by Frenchman Yannick Agnel.

Franklin's victory was made all the more impressive considering she had swum in a 200m freestyle semi-final just 20 minutes earlier.

It didn't stop her storming past Seebohm, who led the turn under world record pace, but had to settle for silver ahead of Japan's Aya Terakawa was third. British world record holder Gemma Spofforth finished fifth.

The American gold medal winner said afterwards: 'I knew it was going to be tough, and I somehow managed to get the gold medal and I have never been as happy in my whole life.'

Giant Grevers collected his first individual gold medal in the final of the men's 100 metres backstroke.

Using every inch of his 6ft 8 in frame, Grevers stretched his long arms out to win in a time of 52.16 seconds, a new Olympic record and just 0.22 outside the world record set by Aaron Peirsol.

American Nick Thoman finished second in 52.92 while Japan's Ryosuke Irie got the bronze medal.
Brit Liam Tancock finished in fourth, just four tenths of a second outside the bronze medal position.

The final American medal of the night was collected by Rebecca Soni, who had to settle for silver when she couldn't overpower 15-year-old Lithuanian Ruta Meilutyte.

The medal haul makes up for the disappointment in the night's first final when favourite Ryan Lochte was stunned out of the medal positions during an electric 200m final in the Aquatics Centre.

The American faded in the last two lengths as Agnel powered away from the chasing pack to claim gold. Yang Sun and Taehwan Park shared silver, ahead of Lochte in fourth and Britain's Robbie Renwick in sixth.

Speaking after his sixth place finish, Glaswegian Renwick said: "If I can keep going the way I am going then who knows maybe in the next four years I could actually get a medal. It all went well, it was another PB for me. It's all about getting amongst the medals but sixth place I can't have done much more.'

Spofforth was equally philosophical after her fifth place finish.

The 25 year old has come close to quitting swimming in the past and insisted tonight's performance in a strong field dominated by Frankling, justified her decision to return to the pool.

She said: 'I've always said it's the journey and not the destination. I am disappointed but everything happens for a reason and I am just really enjoying my swimming right now.

'I have been rock-bottom but it's great to be back enjoying life again and have my passion back for life and swimming. Training with Ryan (Lochte) and working with Olympians is what really inspires me and I work with children back at home and want to inspire them.'

Brit Liam Tancock came agonisingly close to a medal in the 100m backstroke, finishing just four tenths of a second outside third place

After coming so close to landing a gold for Britain, Liam Tancock, the world champion at 50m, has vowed to return in four years time - when he'll be 31.

A Brazilian who won bronze in judo broke his medal when he wore it into the shower, and faces a fight to have it replaced.

Felipe Kitadai said he decided to take his medal into the shower as a joke, but dropped it.Â 

The Brazilian Olympic Committee admitted the IOC had no obligation to give Kitadai another one.

He said: 'I went out there and gave it everything, it didn't quite come off for me but Rio is only four years away. I just love what I do, swimming is an amazing sport. It's an absolute dream to swim in a pool like this, in front of a crowd like this.

'I was walking before and saw the poster about inspiring future generations and I hope we are doing that, not just me but the whole of team GB, hopefully we will inspire the next generation of swimmers.'

Earlier in the pool, Britain's Caitlin McClatchey qualified for the women's 200m freestyle final with a strong second place finish in her semi-final heat.

McClatchey led world champion Federica Pellegrini at the final turn, but was eventually overtaken by the Italian - qualifying sixth fastest.

She said afterwards: 'I could hear the crowd the whole way through, it was incredible. I have had a really tough two years and thought about quitting but I am really enjoying it now. I have got a fantastic team at Loughborough University and without them I couldn't have done it.'
