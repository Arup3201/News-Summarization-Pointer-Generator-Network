The tale of the last Thylacine is a relatively sad one, left to die out in the cold.

One of the largest known carnivorous marsupials in modern times, the Thylacine, which is greek for 'dog-headed pouched one' is more commonly referred to as the Tasmania Tiger, because of its stripped back. 

The animal, which was native to continental Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea, is thought to have become extinct in the 20th century, although sightings are still being reported, yet none have been proven.

Is it really extinct? :The Thylacine, called the Tasmanian Tiger or Tasmanian Wolf, was a large marsupial that is now almost certainly extinct. The female (pictured) was the last one to be captured and died in the old Hobart Zoo. But there have been a number of reported sightings although none have been proven

The last captive Tasmania Tiger, which was later referred to as 'Benjamin', spent several years behind bars in the Hobart zoo after being caught in the Florentine Valley in 1933.

Its gender still a mystery, the animal died three years later on September 7, believed to be as a result of neglect.

It was locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters and died due to the exposure of an extremely cold Tasmanian night.

This Thylacine features in the last known motion picture footage of a living specimen, showing it pacing backwards and forwards in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933 by naturalist David Flea.

The Thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the Australian mainland before British settlement of the continent, but it also survived on the island of Tasmania, along with other species such as the Tasmanian devil.

Intensive hunting encouraged by bounties is generally blamed for its extinction, mercilessly persecuted for allegedly killing sheep. But new research shows it actually had jaws too weak to tackle anything much larger than a possum.

Other factors believed to be responsible for its demise include disease, the introduction of dogs and humans taking up its habitats.

Surviving evidence suggests that it was a relatively shy, nocturnal creature with the general appearance of a medium-to-large-size dog, except for its stiff tail and abdominal pouch, like a kangaroo.

On Australia's threatened species list : The Tasmanian Devil, thought to be related to the Tasmanian Tiger

More than 300 animals are listed as threatened by the Australian government, some of those including the Tasmania devil and the country's icon, the koala

Although there had been a conservation movement for the protection of the animal since 1901, official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced in July 1936, nearly 60 days before 'Benjamin' or the last known Thylacine died in captivity. 

In 1996, on the sixtieth anniversary of the last Tasmanian tiger’s death, 7 September was declared ‘National Threatened Species Day’.

It is a day to be able to reflect on what happened in the past and how people can help protect Australia's threatened species in the future.

The native bee is one species on the critically endangered list. Since the collection of the specimens at Cannington (Perth) in 1954 the population trend is suspected to be in decline

The native bee is one species on the critically endangered list. Since the collection of the specimens at Cannington (Perth) in 1954 the population trend is suspected to be in decline.

The cause of the apparent declines of the population of the yellow spotted Bell frog has been unclear while the total population size of the Wedge-tailed Eagle is estimated at less than 1 000 birds.

The impacts of commercial hunting on Blue Whales have been well documented and have caused them to be on the endangered list as well.

A list of Australia's threatened and vulnerable species can be seen on the Department of Environment's website.
