Beavers living in the Devon countryside are to be rounded up by minsters and sent to live in a zoo, it can be revealed.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who once complained about badgers ‘moving goalposts’ when carrying out a cull, has now turned his attention to the first family of wild beavers seen for 800 years.

Instead of ordering them to be killed, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is trying to find a home for them in captivity, to the anger of wildlife campaigners.

At least three beavers are living in Devon, and have been filmed grooming themselves, gnawing the base of trees and playing together

The wild beavers have been filmed gnawing on trees in the dead of night on the River Otter, near Ottery St Mary.

Three were seen on camera, but experts suspect there could be several more.

Ministers have ruled out culling them, amid fears of another animal rights backlash after carrying killing badgers as part of efforts to reduce TB in cattle.

Defra is now drawing up plans to ‘recapture and rehome’ the beavers, and officials are desperately trying to find a zoo or animal sanctuary willing to give them a home.

However, the plan has angered wildlife campaigners, who want the beavers left in their natural habitat to allow them to be properly studied.

In comments slipped out in a parliamentary answer, environment minister George Eustice said: ‘We intend to recapture and rehome the wild beavers in Devon and are currently working out plans for the best way to do so.

‘All decisions will be made with the welfare of the beavers in mind. There are no plans to cull beavers.’

Beavers were hunted to extinction in England and Wales during the 12th Century and disappeared from the rest of the UK 400 years later

DEFRA, Natural England and the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency are now working on exactly how to catch the animals, and where to send them.

In January rare footage emerged of the beavers after a retired scientist used an infrared camera to capture them in their natural habitat. The animal was pictured in a sequence of shots sinking its teeth into a tree.

Beavers were once native to England but were hunted to extinction during the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th century.

Conservationists have introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the UK, but this is thought to be the first one found living in the wild.

Scotland piloted reintroduction of the beaver in 2009 and Wales is considering the issue now.

But the decision to rule out allowing the beavers to stay in England has been condemned by countryside groups.

An online petition has been set up calling for the beavers to be left alone.

Peter Burgess, conservation manager at the Devon Wildlife Trust, said: ‘We would like to see the beavers remain on the River Otter.

‘The one thing we need to make absolutely clear is we do not want to see reintroduction of species happen in this way bit now they are here and on the river, we want them to remain.

‘It is only acceptable if it is proven that they are disease-free, the community need to agree if they want to have these animals on their doorstep.

‘And there needs to be an organisation or affiliated group which has got the responsibility to look after them and learn as much as possible about them.

‘We have got a huge amount to learn about what these beavers could do for us.’

Experts think the beavers most likely escaped from a private collection, rather than being released deliberately.

‘Beavers are very hard to keep the right side of a fence,’ Mr Burgess said

Derek Gow, a wildlife consultant, also opposed the plan to catch the beavers. ‘At the moment they are ringing all the zoos and asking them if they will take the beavers.

‘What Defra should do is look at a more informative project where by the beavers are left and studied – it becomes an English beaver trial.’

He blamed angling groups for demanding the beavers be removed. ‘Why should three beavers be three beavers too many?

‘This will be the first time in history that we have exterminated a native mammal twice, setting an extraordinary historical precedent.’

A Defra spokesman said: 'We intend to recapture, and rehome these beavers and are currently working out plans for the best way to do so. All decisions will be made with the welfare of the beavers in mind.

'Depending on the source of the animals, they could be carrying a disease not currently present in the UK. In addition, beavers have not been an established part of our wildlife for the last 500 years. Our landscape and habitats have changed since then and we need to assess the impact they could have.'
