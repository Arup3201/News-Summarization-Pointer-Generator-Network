Real Madrid are the star attraction in Tuesday night's Uefa Super Cup final in Cardiff, but what about opponents Sevilla? Sportsmail gives you the lowdown. 

How do we sum up Sevilla?

Character and characters. Always well supported by wonderfully loud fans who belt out the Sevilla anthem and do a superb Poznan, Sevilla were boisterously led for 11 years by president Jose Maria del Nido until he was sentenced to seven years in prison for his part in a municipal embezzlement scandal.

His replacement Jose Castro is a more low-key leader but the club still do their best to shake up the big two. A trip to their concrete bowl Sanchez Pizjuan stadium is normally not one that Real Madrid relish and back in 2007 under Juande Ramos they even stayed in the title race until the last weekend of the season.

Triumph: Sevilla won the Europa League last season with a penalty shootout win over Benfica

VIDEO Sevilla set for Real Super Cup challenge 

As Uefa Cup winners that year they qualified for the European Super Cup but on August 28, their 22-year-old midfielder Antonio Puerta died having not recovered from a heart attack suffered on the pitch in a match against Getafe.

Sevilla wanted the Super Cup final against Carlo Ancelotti’s Milan cancelled but it was played two days after his funeral and they lost 3-1. The dignity with which they still honour their former player is a credit to the club and the supporters – expect Puerta’s name to be sung in Cardiff.

So class off the pitch... and pedigree on it, despite the underdog status?

They’ve won seven cups (including the Europa League three times) since 2000 so yes they’ve got something about them.

Madrid will do well to take nothing for granted then?

Sevilla in their pomp – with Jesus Navas and Dani Alves hurtling down the right wing together and Freddie Kanoute and Luis ‘El Fabuloso’ Fabiano converting the crosses, were a match for anyone, Real Madrid included. But financial restraints have made it ever more difficult to compete.

Prized asset: Jesus Navas moved from Sevilla to Manchester City in the summer of 2013

Selling club: Ivan Rakitic was the latest star to leave Sevilla, this time for Barcelona this summer

A selling club?

That’s putting it mildly. From Alves and Seydou Keita to Barcelona in 2008 it’s been an annual exodus.

They sold Alvaro Negredo, Navas and Gary Medel last year and this year it’s Ivan Rakitic. The best player nearly always leaves at the end of the season.

So how did the win the Europa League last season having sold their stars?

Their manic coach Unai Emery is one of the best in Spain. His intensive man-management style can be draining for the players but they love him because he gets results.

Crouching, gesticulating, grimacing and just generally bobbing up and down in his technical area he sweats as much as some of his players. With limited resources he has done well throughout his career.

And on the pitch?

They still have talent. Colombian striker and former bus conductor Carlos Bacca scored 21 goals in his first season last year and is still leading the line despite interest from Atletico Madrid.

Portuguese keeper Beto was exceptional in the Europa League final. Alberto Moreno is wanted by Liverpool and Iago Aspas has arrived from Liverpool with plenty to prove after last season’s disappointment.

Man at the helm: Coach Unai Emery is intensive and manic, but has led Sevilla to success

Star: Carlos Bacca scored 21 goals in his first season with Sevilla, and attracted interest from Atletico Madrid

And if Moreno and Bacca play well they could join Rakitic through the door?

They will keep Bacca, and coach Emery has said of Moreno: 'He is very much part of our plans. I think he will still be here with us when the window closes.'

How do they play?

Probably 4-3-2-1 with the Argentines Nico Pareja and Fazio in the centre of defefence, Koke at right back, and Moreno as a very attacking left-back.

Jose Antonio Reyes should start next to Denis Suarez, the former Manchester City kid signed from Barca B, and Vitolo, in a line of three behind Bacca.

Do they have a chance?

With fewer players having come back late after playing in the World Cup they should be fitter than Madrid. But when Real tire Carlo Ancelotti will have around 100m euros worth of talent on the bench to freshen things up. It will be very difficult.
