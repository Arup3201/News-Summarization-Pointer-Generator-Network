American ladybirds invading the UK are carrying a potentially deadly STI that could wipe out the native population, experts warned today.

The long hot summer has seen an increase in the number of Harlequin ladybirds which have been threatening British insects for ten years.

But scientists have now discovered the invaders are carrying a sexually transmitted fungal infection which coats them in a bright green mould.

The infection - which can stop the insects moving and eating - was rarely spotted last year, but is feared to have spread to 15 per cent of the southern UK population already.

Experts are worried it could spread from the foreign bugs to the struggling native two-spot ladybird and dramatically reduce their already dwindling population.

They are urging the public to help them record rates of the mushroom-like fungus across the country.

University of Stirling PhD student Katie Murray, who discovered the alarming increase of the STI, said: 'There has been a huge increase in it [the infection] this year that I have found.

She found 15 per cent of the harlequin bugs in London parks had the infection.

Miss Murray said: 'It is a potential problem, but we need to know what the problems could be.

'We don't yet know the impact, but we are going to measure the mortality and also how many eggs an infected female is able to lay.

'These are the kind of things you would expect to be impacted, but we really don't know for certain yet.

'These questions apply to both the harlequin and the native species.

'We've seen a couple of ladybirds that were very very highly affected - the mobility of one was very compromised because it had not only on it's wing parts, but also it's mouth parts and antenna.

'One looked like it was wearing a pair of trousers on all it's legs.'

The aggressive harlequin - or Harmonia axyridis - was introduced to North America in 1988 to control aphids, but spread to Europe, and was first spotted in England in 2004.

It  is now thought to make up 80 per cent of all ladybirds in England and Wales.

Harlequins are resistant to many native infections, have a much more varied diets and and even eat their British counterparts.

Experts had previously seen the STI - called Laboulbeniales - in just a few of both the native and harlequins in the past, but the numbers were not recordable.

But it is difficult to say how much it has affected the native species, because so few of them exist thanks to the invaders.

The fungal infection - called Laboulbeniales - coats the ladybirds in a bright green mould and leaves little yellow bristles growing on their bodies.

The fungus typically does not kill, although it can stop infected ladybirds from eating and moving.

It is a sexually transmitted infection, but can also be spread during their dormant periods, when ladybirds can huddle together together in a group. 

In these cases, instead of the fungus being visible on the back of females and underneath males, the mushroom-like fungus appears on the edge of their bodies. 

Miss Murray's tutor  at the university's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Dr Helen Roy, said the disease can spread between species sexually, but also when they cluster in mixed-species groups.

Dr Roy, who is volunteer leader of the UK Ladybird Survey, said: 'We've seen a real boom in this infection.

'What we wonder is whether this is seen in ladybirds outside of London, and we want to know what does it do.'

'It is more likely to be spread within a species because the usually mate with the right species, but that isn't always the case,' she said.

'Also it isn't just transferred sexually. In their dormant period ladybirds can huddle together in a group, and these can be mixed species groups.

'In these cases instead of seeing the fungus on the back of the females and the underneath of the males, you see it on the edge of the bodies.'

The researchers are now asking for help from the public to track the disease by looking for ladybirds in their houses, sheds or in leaf litter and completing an online survey.

Records will allow researchers to look at the extent and spread-rate of the epidemic.

Katie added: 'The cold conditions at this time of year mean ladybirds huddle together in leaf litter or other sheltered places like houses, sheds, garages, or other outbuildings.

'Checking for these groups of ladybirds is a good way to have a look for the fungus, which leaves little yellow bristles growing on their bodies.

'Many ladybirds will have only a few of the bristles, so people will have to look carefully.'
