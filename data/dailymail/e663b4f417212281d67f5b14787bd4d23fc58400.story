Schoolgirl Jessica Peters, 15, vanished from her home in Oxted, Surrey at midnight on Saturday

A missing 15-year-old girl who vanished from her home over the weekend is believed to be with a man in his 20s, according to police.

Schoolgirl Jessica Peters was last seen at her family home in Oxted, Surrey, at about midnight on Saturday.

A huge search operation was launched by police after the teenager failed to return to home.

Detective Inspector Clive Vale, of Surrey Police, said: 'We urgently need the public's help in tracing Jessica and would ask for anyone with any information to come forward so we know that she is safe and well.

'Jessica has links with Buckinghamshire, it is possible that she is in that area.

'However we are following various lines of enquiry and are keeping an open mind about her current whereabouts.'

A spokesman for Surrey Police added: 'Officers believe it is possible that she may be with a man in his early 20s. 

'He is described as being white with dark hair.'

They would not disclose the relationship between Jessica and the man, other than to confirm they were known to each other.

Jessica's Facebook profile indicates her as living in a village near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, and having links with Towcester, in Northamptonshire.

It is believed she moved to Surrey recently.

Jessica is described as white, between 5ft 3ins and 5ft 6ins tall, of slim build and long hair which is currently dark brown.

She is also known to dye her hair blonde and it is possible that she may change her hair colour.

She was last seen wearing black leggings, a burgundy jumper and white Converse shoes.

Police believe that she took extra clothing with her and may have changed her outfit

Police said they believe Jessica could be with a man in his 20s and said she has links to Buckinghamshire
