A Scottish farmer has spent £5,000 on CCTV cameras and guard dogs to protect his new flock of the 'world's cutest sheep'.

Raymond Irvine paid £55,000 for 10 ewes and one ram of the Valais Blacknose breed and now intends to breed them at his farm near Tomintoul in Moray.

The sheep, which are only found in Switzerland, are well-known for their shaggy coats and spiral horns, but it is their distinctive, incredibly dark 'black hole' faces - which look as if they have been Photoshopped to have all features removed - that draw much of the attention.

Mr Irvine paid £55,000 for his 11 Valais Blacknose sheep plus several more thousands on transportation and vet bills.

His 10 ewes and show-winning ram King Kong are now the first Valois Blacknose herd in Scotland.

The sheep are so valuable Mr Irvine has installed CCTV and brought in guard dogs to stop them being stolen from his farm.

He and girlfriend Jenni McAllister got a surprise when it turned out one of the ewes was already pregnant, giving birth to Scotland’s first baby Valais Blacknose.

The Valais Blacknose is a coarse-wooled sheep from Switzerland - kept primarily for meat, but also used for wool.

It is a unique breed found in the Upper Valais, in the German-speaking part of the canton of Valais.

Their earliest mention dates back to 1400 but they were first recognized as a separate breed in 1962.

Both rams and ewes have huge spiral horns and a thick coat that keeps them warm during the bitter Swiss winter.

The chill of the Highlands in mid-January should prove no challenge from this cute but particularly hardy breed.

Highly domesticated, the sheep do not shy away from contact with humans.

As a result, many residents of Upper Valais have started keeping them as pets in recent years.

They are now regularly seen being walked on leads or tied up outside supermarkets in the villages around Upper Valais.

Mr Irvine, 42, said: 'My girlfriend showed me a picture and I laughed because I didn’t think they were real.'

'Then
 we thought there could be something in this so we decided to travel 
over and see them in real life. We fell in love with them at first 
sight,' he added.

'It’s 
the first time this breed has ever been in Scotland. I think they are 
the world’s cutest sheep. They are so docile and they just make you 
smile as soon as you see them, Mr Irvine went on to say.

Mr Irvine and Miss McAllister, 34, spent several weeks researching the breed, which is unique to the Valais region of Switzerland, before making the trip.

They negotiated with several breeders, to select individuals to buy, which proved difficult as the farmers did not want to part with the beloved animals.

The lucky 11 were then transported in a lorry through customs to France, Calais, Dover and finally to Scotland - all within 24 hours.

Mr Irvine said he got a surprise just days after the sheep arrive, when one of the ewes unexpectedly gave birth.

'One morning I went to check on them and this thing was on the ground. The farmer had forgotten to tell me one of the females was pregnant,' he said.

'So now we have the first ever Valais lamb to be born on Scottish soil,' he added.

Up for grabs: Jenni McAllister said she is considering putting a couple of the lambs on the market next year, and possibly crossing a few of the others with other breeds of sheep

The sheep will not struggle in the chill of the Scottish winter because the part of Switzerland they live in usually gets much colder.

On a trip the couple watched in surprise as people walked the sheep on leads around the village.

Whilst the couple were enjoying a romantic meal two of the sheep were brought inside by a Swiss farmer who didn’t want to leave them outside.

Mr Irvine said they hope to increase the size of their flock and while many lamb twice a year, they will only be lambed once, in March.

The couple are considering putting a couple of the lambs on the market next year, and crossing them with other breeds of sheep.

But they will work to maintain the characteristics of the breed and look at different avenues on how to develop a lucrative market for the wool.
