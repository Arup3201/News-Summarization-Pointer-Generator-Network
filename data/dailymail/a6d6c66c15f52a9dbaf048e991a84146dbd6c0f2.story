The little sister of murdered schoolgirl Masa Vukotic fought back tears as she spoke of how she won't be able to see her blossom into a young woman as hundreds gathered for her funeral.

Nadja Vukotic, 14, gave a heartfelt tribute to Masa at  Melbourne's Springvale Botanical Cemetery on Thursday morning after the 17-year-old was fatally stabbed in a random attack at a Doncaster park last week.

'I never got to tell Masa just how important she was to me although I know in my heart she knew how much I loved her,' Nadja said.

'Darling Masa, I love you so much and that will never change. You may be gone but you will never be forgotten.'

Masa's distressed parents, Natasa and Slabvoljub, and siblings Nadja, 14, and Petar, 16, struggled as they followed her white coffin adorned with pink roses - the teenager's favourite colour - into the chapel. 

During the packed service, Slabvoljub Vukotic, wearing a pink pocket handkerchief, promised his daughter the family would try to be brave in the days and weeks to come. 

'We will try to be as brave and courageous as you were....I promise I will come to you one day but until then my heart bleeds for you,' Mr Vukotic said.

Masa's mother Natasa then managed to take to the podium to make a heart-felt promise to her daughter.

'From the first moment I looked into your eyes, you were my most precious Masa. I know this is not our final goodbye. I will race to you with open arms and say to you “come to your mum”.'

With every sunrise and every sunset you will be in my soul and you will be in my heart.

'I will love you as I always have…. I will always think pink.'

An emotional statement was read out on behalf of the family, along with a poem they had composed about Masa.  

Her parents, sister and best friend all gave heartfelt tributes describing the Canterbury Girls Secondary College student as 'simply one of a kind'.

Masa's younger sister Nadja, 14, told mourners of how she will no longer be able to watch her adored older sister 'blossom into a woman' or be able to share private jokes.

'She was a beautiful daughter, a loving sister and a supportive friend. Masa was beautiful on the inside and beautiful on the outside,' she said.

'She was always saw the beauty in others. Masa was also ambitious and never let anyone get in the way of her dreams. I am honoured to be her sister. 

'Words cannot describe how much she will be missed. I feel like we had so much left to teach one another and so many inside jokes to create.

'I always thought I'd be able to see her blossom into a woman that she had already started to become.'

Nadja, standing in front of her sister's coffin where she had placed a photograph of Masa, asked mourners to always remember her sister so she could 'live on forever.' 

Her school friends, many who wearing pink ribbons in their hair and arms, created a sea of pink flowers outside the chapel

Masa's best friend, Maddie Stone,  made mourners laugh at the service highlighting her friend's 'bright and bubbly' personality and her love of Lolita, Pokemon, telling stories and dressing up.

She spoke of their fun times at Doncaster Primary School where Masa spoke of her dreams of being a princess and one day marrying a prince.

'She was also ambitious and driven…never fake or shallow and will be greatly missed,' she said.

Maddie told how the pair went to school with friend Tim Draper who would later become Masa's boyfriend.

'Looking back now if you had told us she would be dating when she got older, she and I and probably Tim would have absolutely laughed our heads off.

'It goes to show how much life was always changing. 

Masa, a student at Canterbury Girls Secondary College, was stabbed to death as she walked near her Doncaster home in Melbourne's east last Tuesday night

Maddie spoke about Masa's 'amazing' family and described a happy family life including pool parties, great food, and painting eggs at Easter.

'There was always an unlimited amount of great food and desserts.'

'To me they will always be my home away from home.'

A public memorial will be held on Saturday - Princess Marci’s Royal Parade - at Queen Victoria Gardens on St Kilda Road from noon.

Masa was stabbed to death as she walked near her Doncaster home last Tuesday night.

Sean Price, 31, was charged with her murder along with a strong of other crimes.

Police allege he went on a rampage of rape, assault and an attempted car-jacking in the hours after he is accused of killing the 17-year-old and before he handed himself into police.

While Masa's life was much too short, life is not measured by the number of breaths you take but by the number of breaths that take your breath away.

Masa had many breath-taking moments in her life. She was born on December 1 1997. Since birth she was bursting with life, vitality and passion.

She was 17, sparking, outgoing, funny, intelligent and simply one of a kind.

Masa loved life and was eager to embrace all it had to offer. As a perfectionist she excelled in everything she did but she especially love reading, travelling and spending time with her family and friends.

She loved to dance and perform. She loved Cosplay. For those of you who don't know what that is Cosplay is a performance art where costumes and fashion accessories represent a specific character or idea.

Masa had more costumes and accessories than anyone. She used to take her mum shopping and she'd always buy another dress to take home and add to her collection.

Masa also had an unrivalled love for fashion which she said she developed as a baby as a result of her mum changing her outfit three or four times a day to take baby photos.

On a recent trip to Paris and Montenegro she managed to pack, among many other things, four heavy winter coats so she wouldn't be photographed in the same one.

Her room is all pink with her collection of costumes, quirky posters and so on.

She had skill to take selfies like no other and she was indeed the princess of selfies.

She made many many friends in her short life. Masa loved her sister Nadja and brother Petar dearly. She shared a special bond with them both and that is a bond that only family who are close with siblings share.

You'd hear Masa and Nadja talking together, performing various roles in front of the camera.

Masa and her mother were very close. They laughed together and often debated together. Masa always seemed to win the debate.

Masa wanted to become a lawyer and dreamed of enjoying drinking lattes in a range of different outfits.

Masa was an inspiration to many. Her motivation and drive were exceptional and would have been an outstanding wife. She used to go on walks with her father which would usually end up in some make-up store.

The family would like to express their gratitude for the love and support they received from their family and friends and community at large. A particular thank you to Victoria Police.

Masa touched all our hearts. Even if you do not know her personally. We miss her beautiful smile, her funny little mannerisms and the sparkle in her eyes. Masa we love you, you will be in our hearts forever.
