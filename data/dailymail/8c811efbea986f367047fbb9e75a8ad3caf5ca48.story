Dusan Tadic scored the winner for Southampton over Manchester United on Sunday and ripped off his shirt in celebration.   

The Saints rose to third in table after the Serbian midfielder's late strike secured their first ever Premier League victory at Old Trafford. 

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman, though, wasn't keen on Tadic's celebration. 'I don't like players taking off their shirt,' he said, and bemoaned the yellow card that it earned.

Shirtless celebrations are nothing new in football and Tadic's antics are ready made for comparison with a number of other players over the years.

10) RYAN GIGGS vs Arsenal: FA Cup, 1999

After scoring arguably the FA Cup's greatest ever goal during Manchester United's treble winning season, the Welshman unsheathed an impressive chest rug in a burst of adrenalin and machismo.

9) ALEXIS SANCHEZ vs Manchester City: Premier League, 2014 

The Chilean forward has been a huge success since joining Arsenal from Barcelona in the summer and showed off his impressive body after scoring against Manchester City. 

8) VICTOR MOSES vs Ethiopia: World Cup Qualifying, 2013

Stoke City winger Moses scored a penalty to secure Nigeria's passage to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, before showing off his six pack to the crowd. 

7) EDIN DZEKO vs West Brom: Premier League, 2012

The Manchester City striker celebrated netting his late winner against the Baggies with an intimidating pose. 

6) GEORGE ELOKOBI vs Birmingham City: Championship, 2012

Elokobi didn't enjoy the most successful of loan spells at Nottingham Forrest, but secured cult status after showing off his bulging physique. 

5) CARLOS TEVEZ vs Tottenham: Premier League, 2007

Tevez' first goal for West Ham, a stunning free-kick, is even more memorable for his shirtless celebration and dive into the crowd at Upton Park.  

4) DAVID GINOLA vs Manchester City: Premier League, 2000

After then Aston Villa manager John Gregory suggested that Ginola might be unfit, the Frenchman proved just how wrong he was after scoring against Manchester City. 

3) HULK vs Benfica: Europa League, 2010

The aptly named striker imitated a certain Marvel comic book character after his goal against Benfica during FC Porto's run to Europa League title in 2010. 

2) MARIO BALOTELLI vs Germany: European Championships 2012

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli's scowling celebration against Germany at Euro 2012 later became an internet sensation with a long-list of memes and parodies. 

1) CRISTIANO RONALDO vs Atletico Madrid: Champions League 2014

When Cristiano Ronaldo revealed his monstrous torso after scoring the fourth goal in Real Madrid's Champions League final victory last year, he wowed football fans around the world.   

Of course, if you are going to take your shirt off, you probably should make sure you have enough time to put it back on... 

Former Manchester United striker Diego Forlan celebrated shirtless after scoring against Southampton in 2002, but play had restarted before he and finished, with the Saints on the attack.
