Samsung has announced that its Galaxy Mega phone – the biggest smartphone on the global market - will finally be available to consumers in the U.S. from Friday although there have been no announcements made about when it will come to the UK or other regions.

With a screen measuring a giant 6.3 inches diagonally, the Mega looks more like a tablet than a phone.

Samsung have described it as a hybrid that combines the portability of a smartphone with the immersive experience that a tablet offers for movies, books, music and games.

They are confident that the big design will appeal to commuters and others who regularly watch films on their gadgets.

'The newest addition to the Galaxy family balances an optimal viewing experience on a 6.3-inch HD screen, yet is ultra-thin and portable enough to put into a pocket or hold in one hand,' the firm said.

'The GALAXY Mega offers a mix of popular smartphone and tablet features such as an effortless user experience, a split screen, multitasking between video and other apps and more.'

It claims video and web browsing will be the main uses for the Mega.

A phone too far? The Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone was the first 'phablet' but now an even bigger version has been launched

Analysts have deemed a 'phablet' to be a mobile gadget with a screen more than 5 inches diagonally.

The word comes from blending phone and tablet.

Samsung's Galaxy Note was the first popular 'phablet'.

Shipments of gadgets that are 5 inches or bigger in screen size are predicted to surge nearly nine-fold to 228 million during the next three years.

Estimates vary because no one can agree on where smartphones stop and phablets start.

AT&T says it will start selling the Mega on Friday for $150 with a two-year service contract. The Mega is also coming to Sprint and U.S. Cellular. Dates and prices weren't announced for those carriers.

The U.S. is playing catchup with the Mega as the phone has already been available in Europe, Russia, and Samsung's home base of South Korea since May.

'We are aware of a great potential in the bigger screen for extensive viewing multimedia, web browsing, and more,' said JK Shin of Samsung.

'We are excited to provide another choice to meet our consumers’ varying lifestyles, all while maintaining the high-quality features of the award-winning GALAXY series.'

However, some critics are less impressed and say the new size is too big to be considered a cellphone.

Samsung is known for big phones. Its flagship Galaxy S4 is 5 inches, while the Galaxy Note 2 is 5.5 inches. Apple's iPhone 5 is 4 inches.

Samsung has helped to popularize the so-called 'phablet' category - in which phones approach tablet dimensions - with its original 5.3in Galaxy Note, which was released in 2011.

Analysts have deemed a 'phablet' is a mobile gadget with a screen more than 5inches diagonally. The word comes from blending phone and tablet.

The rise of the giant phone: Samsung's Galaxy Mega 6.3 is now the biggest phone on the market, dwarfing the iPhone

Samsung is also known for offering a variety of devices, with different screen sizes and prices, to target a range of consumers. Because of that, it's now the leading maker of phones.

Apple, by contrast, has been releasing one model a year that targets high-end consumers. A new iPhone is expected this fall.

The Mega includes many features available in other recent Galaxy phones. That includes Multi Window, which allows multitasking in a split screen, and Easy Mode, which reduces the number of features and choices for new smartphone users.

Mega buyers can choose either nova black or polaris white as the color.

As Samsung's phones get larger, at least one of HTC Corp.'s is getting smaller. AT&T announced Monday that it will start selling a smaller version of the HTC One.

Called the HTC One Mini, it will have a 4.3-inch screen, compared with 4.7 inches on the standard model. It's also lighter, at 4.3 ounces. The One is 5 ounces.

The One Mini will be about $100 cheaper than its big brother. It will be available starting Friday for $100 with a two-year service agreement.
