Just for a moment, she still looked so proud.

The sun broke through briefly to illuminate her in the water, maintaining that air of might and majesty that only Britain’s most famous warship could boast.

Yet this was the saddest day in the illustrious life of HMS Ark Royal. Her deck was stripped bare of aircraft and her hull was streaked with years of rust and neglect.

Final journey: HMS Ark Royal leaves Portsmouth for the last time yesterday bound for the Turkish scrapyard after plans to save the vessel failed

Empty: The warship, which was used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, lies empty as it leaves Portsmouth Harbour yesterday and was waved off for the last time

Crowds: Hundreds gathered in Portsmouth yesterday to wave off the Ark Royal as she left Portsmouth Harbour for the last time

Goodbye: Union Jack flags flutter in the wind on the south coast yesterday as the HMS Ark Royal leaves Britain for the final time - this time for the scrapyard

Departure: The deck empty, the HMS Ark Royal is towed to Turkey and to the scrapyard yesterday

After more than a quarter of a century
of service, the aircraft carrier – the fifth Royal Navy ship to bear a 
name that dates back to the days of victory over the Spanish Armada – 
began her final, solemn journey to the scrapyard.

She wasn’t even allowed the romantic 
privilege of sailing into the sunset at the 30 knots she was capable of.
Instead, tugs hauled her slowly out of Portsmouth harbour towards her 
last resting place in Turkey.

The ultimate indignity is still to come. Soon, she will be broken up and recycled to make razor blades and tin cans.

No wonder former crewmen wore black 
armbands on the dockside. No wonder there were more tears than cheers 
from the hundreds who gathered, like mourners, to say their farewells.

Goodbye: A large crowd of people watch as the HMS Ark Royal is towed out of Portsmouth harbour yesterday for the last time bound for Turkey

Departure: HMS Ark Royal was the fifth ship to bear the same name when she was launched in 1981. However, she was taken out of service in 2010 under Government spending cuts

Farewell: A large crowd gathered in Portsmouth yesterday as the ship made its final voyage. The 22,000-tonne light aircraft carrier has been sold to ship recycling firm Leyal for £2.9million. The ship will be taken 2,000 miles to Izmir in west Turkey

Goodbye: The Ark Royal was the fifth ship to be called the Ark Royal, a name that dates back to 1587

Salute: A small crowd gathers on the beach as the ship is towed away for the last time ready to be scrapped

Launched: June 2, 1981

What happens to her now: Sold for scrap

Retirement date: 2016 (brought forward five years by the Coalition Government)

Motto: Zeal does not rest

Constructed:  Swan Hunter's Dockyard, Newcastle

Aircraft: Can hold up to 24 planes

Once, they would have assembled here 
as ‘the mighty Ark’ returned from war to a ‘welcome home’ celebration 
with splendid military pomp.

Yesterday, most stood in silence or simply 
waved Union Flags as the 22,000-ton ship came into view, and went.

The 
most miserable epitaph for Ark Royal and what’s left of the Royal Navy 
is that her decommissioning and sale to a foreign country for 
£2.9million was claimed by defence bosses yesterday to have saved 
taxpayers more than £100million.

The ship, which carried 22 aircraft 
and had a complement of 1,051, was retired five years ahead of schedule 
in 2011, a high-profile casualty of the government’s controversial 
defence review.

There was outrage at the prospect of selling the ship 
online, with plans to turn her into a casino in Hong Kong, a floating 
hospital or a commercial diving wreck all rejected.

Destiny, however, 
sent her on the same 2,000-mile journey her sister ship made two years 
ago. HMS Invincible, heroine of the Falklands war, also went for scrap.

Among those lining Portsmouth’s old 
harbour yesterday was John Mayer, a stores assistant who was one of the 
first to serve on board after she was launched in 1981 at a cost of 
£320million.

‘It’s a very emotional day,’ he said.

Steve Higgins, a former Ark Royal 
petty officer, said the memories will ‘remain for ever’. ‘To the last, 
she showed the character of a proper lady of the seas,’ he added.

Launch: The new HMS Ark Royal at the Swan Hunter shipyard in June 1981 after being launched by the Queen Mother

When the HMS Ark Royal was launched in June 1981, it was the fifth great British warship to bear the famous name.

The
Ark Royal was originally the name given to a ship ordered for Sir 
Walter Raleigh in 1586. It was involved in the battles against the 
Spanish Armada, and served for more than 50 years.

That first ship was eventually broken up in 1638, and it was almost 300 years before another vessel bore the same name.

The
second HMS Ark Royal, launched in 1914, was the first ship designed to 
carry aircraft in history. The 7,080 ton ship bore little resemblance to
her 800 ton 16th century predecessor. But like her namesake she served 
her country with distinction and was used in both World Wars.

The
Ark Royal was launched in 1937 but came to a watery end in 1941 when 
sunk by a German U-boat. The fourth Ark Royal was launched in 1950 
before being scrapped in 1979 and replaced by the current one in 1981.

The
present Ark Royal was built by Swan Hunters Ship Builders' yard at 
Wallsend in 1978 and launched by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen 
Mother. She was accepted into service on July 1, 1985.
