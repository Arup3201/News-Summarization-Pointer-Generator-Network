Cristiano Ronaldo's participation in the World Cup remains in doubt after Portugal issued a medical bulletin which revealed the world's best player is carrying two injuries.

The Real Madrid forward is nursing a thigh strain as well as tendonitis in his left knee, according to the Portuguese FA.

Ronaldo joined fellow doubts Raul Meireles, Pepe and Beto in training separately from the main group at New York Jets' training centre on Tuesday.

'We hope that Cristiano is in good enough shape to play and to help the team,' said team-mate Nani.

'He is going well, and he is relaxed about it. Things are going the right way,

'If for some reason (Ronaldo) is not there, whoever is there playing has to be confident in their ability to get the job done.

'The World Cup is a one-of-a-kind challenge. I want to be fully fit, and in top form alongside my team-mates. I could not be there last time, but happily, I am here now.'

Portugal begin their campaign in Brazil against Germany on June 16 before games against the USA and Ghana.

Paulo Bento's side face Mexico in a friendly near Boston on Friday before taking on Ireland next Tuesday at the New York Jets' MetLife Stadium which hosted the Super Bowl in February.
