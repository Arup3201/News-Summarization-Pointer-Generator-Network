People spend years filling their house with items to make their surroundings more homely.

So when this fast-food fanatic decided to decorate, he did so by filling his home with 1,000 souvenirs based on his favourite food - hamburgers.

Harry Sperl, or 'Hamburger Harry', has spent 23 years collecting the items and has created the world's only museum dedicated to hamburgers.

Fanatic: Harry Sperl from Daytona Beach, Florida, has collected thousands of items, including this bed, to create a museum dedicated to hamburgers

Obsessed: The 57-year-old burger enthusiast has created a completely custom bed in the form of the world's largest cheeseburger, complete with a sesame seed-covered spread and matching pillows

The enthusiast's collection has transformed his Daytona Beach home in Florida into a shrine which is dubbed Burgerbilla.

The 57-year-old has a custom-made bed in the form of the world's largest cheeseburger, complete with a sesame seed cover and matching pillows.

Mr Sperl's collection includes a burger mobile phone, hamburger money banks, biscuit jars, clocks, hats, trays, erasers, badges, magnets, music boxes and salt and pepper shakers.

He said: 'They taste good, they look good and the hamburger is an icon of the United States of America.'

Souvenirs: The Hamburger hobbyist has picked up most of the collection at flea markets and garage sales

Invention: The fast food fanatic has built the world's only Hamburger Harley

The Hamburger hobbyist developed an interest in burgers when he bought some hamburger display items from a toy store.

Since then most of the collection was picked up at flea markets and garage sales, where Harry has trawled for hamburger highlights.

Hamburger Harry is also the creator or the world's only Hamburger Harley, which is converted into a trike with a burger body ketchup shock absorbers and pickle handlebars.

Delicious: Mr Sperl says his obsession stems from the fact hamburgers taste so good and are an icon of American culture

Despite being born in Wettenberg, Germany - which is a little over 240 miles south of Hamburg - Mr Sperl is a true American at heart.

Harry said: 'I love the weather, the sunshine, the beach, the ocean, the American lifestyle, the American way of life.

'I always say I was born in the wrong country.

'Because of cholesterol problems, I have to reduce the consumption of my favourite food! But yes, I like good hamburgers!'

Mr Sperl has invited members of the public into his home to view his collection, but is planning to expand by building a museum shaped like his favourite food.
