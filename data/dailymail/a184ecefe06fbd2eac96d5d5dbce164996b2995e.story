It seems that women will place their faith in all manner of weird and wonderful beauty lotions, potions and gadgets in their quest for youth.

But one store in Japan is taking age-defying gadgets to a whole new level.

Japan Trend Shop are selling a 'face bra' that promises to help fight the smile lines that grow more prominently with age.

Would YOU use this to beat wrinkles? The Hourei Lift Bra claims to help banish smile lines

The Hourei Lift Bra is a band that slides over the back of your head 
and then the frame fits easily onto your nose.

Its soft silicone rubber 
curves have been designed to feel comfortable on your skin while the 'wire' design promises to place only gentle pressure on your cheeks.

'If you worry about your smile or laugh
lines (nasolabial folds), then a simple but effective device like this 
that you can wear daily is your ticket to combating the signs of ageing,' say producers.

The makers also suggest doing mouth exercises while wearing the £25 frame.

An American 'sleep expert' has created the first wrinkle-busting pillow.

The £55 memory foam cushion features cut out sides to prevent you squishing your face as you sleep and supposedly preventing puffiness and lines.

'I went to my doctor and asked him why I have more wrinkles on one side of my face than the other,' says Patty Colman, creator of the Wrinkle Prevention Pillow.

Her GP told her that sleeping in certain positions night after night leads to sleep lines or
wrinkles that become etched into the surface of the skin.

The wrinkle prevention pillow allows you to sleep without your face or eyes touching the sides

So, to ease the stress of ageing, she created the product to allow women to continue their beauty sleep with full faith.

The Pillow supports and cradles sleeper's head so face never touches pillow. She claims it also works wonders for anyone with eyelash extensions.

The Japanese Trend Shop also sell the wrinkle-busting balaclava and The Faceweaver Exercise Mask,   which they describe as 'a new face stretcher from Japan that promises to give users a
more youthful and energetic look'.

The stretchy accessory wraps around your
face and claims to help exercise different muscles while you make all 
kinds of bizarre facial expressions.

Other unusual products sold on the 
website include the £80 Eye Slack Haruka, which is aimed at combating 
sagging skin around the eyes with battery-powered vibrating pads, and 
the £70 Beauty Lift High Nose, which applies vibrations to help push the
nose higher and make it firmer.

For those looking to emulate the plumped-up lips of Katie Price, the rather cartoonish Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece slips over
the wearer's own mouth, with the ultimate goal of boosting the lips to a
more prominent pout.
