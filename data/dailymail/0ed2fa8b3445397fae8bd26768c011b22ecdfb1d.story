Mario Balotelli wants £5million-per-year after tax to join Arsenal this summer.

The Gunners have shown an interest in the Italy forward after learning he will be allowed to leave AC Milan this summer.

Arsenal's interest in Balotelli had cooled after a move for Loic Remy progressed, but their attempt to sign the Queens Park Rangers striker has now been called off due to his wage demands.

And Arsenal are now set to revive their interest in Balotelli - but the forward's salary demands could be a stumbling block.

The north London club have been quoted a £100,000-per-week net for his wages.

In
 addition to his wage package, the Gunners would have to fork out in the
 region of £16m to prise him away from the San Siro.

The
 ex-Manchester City star is currently in New York with girlfriend 
Fanny Neguesha, as he enjoys his time off after playing for Italy at the
 World Cup.

He recently uploaded a series of
