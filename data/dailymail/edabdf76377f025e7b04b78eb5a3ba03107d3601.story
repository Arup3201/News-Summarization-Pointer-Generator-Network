Accused: Sanford Rubenstein allegedly raped a 42-year-old official at the National Action Network after coming home from Rev Al Sharpton's birthday party

The woman who was allegedly raped by a top civil rights lawyer after meeting him at Rev. Al Sharpton's star-studded 60th birthday party had consensual sex with him the morning after, sources claim.

The alleged victim, a 42-year-old who works for Sharpton's National Action Network, went home with Sanford Rubenstein, 70, after the celebration last week.

She was then allegedly raped by the high-powered lawyer.

Investigators suspect he may even have used an object to penetrate her during the alleged attack in his Manhattan penthouse, sources told the New York Daily News.

The anonymous accusation, which emerged yesterday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed the next morning. 

The claims, reported yesterday, come as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side today for evidence.

He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement  sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent.

Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. 

Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.'

Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported.

Close: The Rev Al Sharpton, center with Rubenstein to the left, has said there is no place for the alleged behavior - but avoided jumping to the conclusion that he is guilty

He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn’t mean you’re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain’t no place for that in our community.'

Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left.

Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee.

A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter.

Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters

But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex.

Rubenstein hit back at the claims today through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman.

Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'.
