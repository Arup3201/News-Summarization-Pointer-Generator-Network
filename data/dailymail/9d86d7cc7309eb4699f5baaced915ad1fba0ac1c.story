When beloved family pet cat Woosie disappeared in 2011 his owners soon gave him up for dead.

But little did they know the tomcat had wandered into a Ginsters pasty factory 30 miles away and was being spoilt rotten - living on a rich diet of pastries and sandwiches fed to him by staff.

The animal’s adventure came to an end last week when workers decided to hand him in to the local vets.

Returned: Stunned owners Helen and Phillip Johns suspect Woosie lived on a diet of pastries after spending the last three years in a Ginsters pasty factory

A scan of his microchip revealed he belonged to Helen and Phillip Johns, of Gover, near
 St Austell, Cornwall,  and the cat has now been returned home. 

And far from looking bedraggled after his three year absence, Woosie seems to have piled on the pounds.

Mother-of-three Helen, 58, said: 'He went out one morning as cats do and we 
never saw him again.

'Then 
nearly three years on, we get a call from the vets saying we have got 
your cat here. I looked at our other cat Lola and told them they must be
 mistaken.

'Then it suddenly registered they must mean Woosie. I was so shocked.

'The vet said he had been living in the Ginsters pasty factory in Callington and one of the workers had been looking after him.

'I was gobsmacked. We never expected to see him again, not after he’d been missing for three years.

'He’s a heavy cat now - he’s quite large. We think that he may have been eating all the pasties and sandwiches up there.

'He’s probably been given lots of titbits from staff there.'

Woosie had been adopted by workers who let him have free reign of the offices during the day, fed him on Ginsters products and renamed him ‘George’.

Staff at the pie factory 33 miles away say he roamed the grounds outside at night and was always there to welcome workers when they arrived in the morning.

Since his return Mrs Johns said Woosie had settled in - apart from the 'odd hiss' at their other cat Lola who was just a kitten when he disappeared.

Mrs Johns said: 'He came home on Tuesday evening, came straight into the house and just stretched out in the chair as if nothing had happened.

'He’s like Lord Muck. It’s surreal. He’s unfazed by it.'

The grandmother-of-one said she was dumbfounded as to how Woosie had ended up at the pasty factory near Plymouth.

She said: 'We have no idea how he ended up there, but cats are curious.

Diet: Runaway Woosie returned three years after disappearing rather more plump than when he left - possibly due to being fed on pasties from a nearby Ginsters factory

'We think he may have climbed into the back of a lorry delivering to the Co-Op store and gone unnoticed by the driver.

'Or he could have jumped into someone’s car who was visiting the area when they opened the door.

'We just don’t know. It’s just a miracle he’s here after three years.'

Mrs Johns said the vet had advised her not to let Woosie out for a couple of weeks while he adjusted to his surroundings.

'There is a worry that he will just go off again,' she said. 'But we are just glad to have him home.'

Ginsters said they were unaware of the incident but were 'delighted' Woosie had been reunited with his owners.

A spokesperson said: 'As you would expect from a food manufacturer, we have very strict procedures to ensure that stray animals do not venture into the perimeter of our premises at any time.

'We have not been made aware of this particular incident, however, we are always pleased to hear of a nice ending to a story and delighted that Woosie has been reunited with its owners.'
