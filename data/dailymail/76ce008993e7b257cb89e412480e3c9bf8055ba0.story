Ampersand's Founder James Jayasundera said: 'The echoes of the Raj can still be seen in many aspects of day to day life in India. 

'A taste of the privileged lifestyles enjoyed by the fortunate few can still be experienced if you know where to go. 

'Traditions that have long since passed in Britain have survived in India, from white gloved footmen to steam engines and tiffin boxes, it often feels like one is stepping back in time.'  

Colonial India has not featured in a major TV series since the much-loved  The Jewel in the Crown in the 1980s. 

Indian Summers follows the decline of the British Empire and the birth of modern India. It focuses on the passions and politics of the period, among both the British elite and the Indian population.

Mr Pattinson said: 'Paul (Rutman, writer) came to me, with Simon Curtis (another executive producer).

'It’s not often that someone comes to you with a fully formed, madly ambitious… they came and they pitched me 50 hours of television that would start in 1932 and would follow these characters through a massive romantic, political saga, through to independence, and in so doing describe a key piece of history. So this was entirely originally work.'
