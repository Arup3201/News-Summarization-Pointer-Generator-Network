Police sought answers Wednesday from a retired correction officer after his dispute with a pair of strangers ended with a fatal shooting.

Former officer, Willie Groomes, 69, shot Gilbert Drogheo at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn, police said.

Drogheo's uncle declared Groomes to be 'a murderer' on Wednesday night.

He said that his nephew was a dedicated electrician.

'He was a great kid,' the uncle said. 'All he did was work,' he told the Daily News.

Investigators took Groomes into custody on Wednesday but later released him without charges. 

The shooting  spread panic inside a subway station at the height of the evening rush hour when the retired officer, who's 69 years old, boarded a Brooklyn-bound subway train in Manhattan.

He was armed with a small Ruger handgun that he was licensed to carry in public.

According to witnesses, it appeared that the former officer angered Drogheo, 32, and another man by stepping in between them while they were talking, police said.

The men and the officer argued before they pushed him down into an empty seat on the train, police said. 

All three men exited the train at the next stop in Brooklyn, where there was a second confrontation on the station's mezzanine level, police said. 

The retired officer tussled with Drogheo before pulling his weapon and firing one round, which struck the victim in the chest, they said.

New York Police Department officers assigned to the station heard the gunshot and quickly detained the shooting suspect. Drogheo, who was from Harlem, died at a hospital. 

The other man was taken into custody.

Television station WCBS broadcast a cellphone video showing a man it identified as the retired officer cornering a smaller man near an exit in the subway station and pushing him. 

The men are seen struggling before a gunshot is heard and bystanders scatter.

Subway passenger Thomas Berry, who witnessed the dispute, told the Daily News the older man had initially tried to avoid trouble.

The officer told the other two men, ''Leave me alone. Don't talk to me,'' Berry said. 'He was being really calm.'

But as the dispute grew more heated, the older man flashed a gun, Berry said.

'Everyone said 'gun' and ran off the train,' he said. 'I was standing there in shock.' 

A cell phone video obtained by CBS New York revealed the moment the officer allegedly shot and fatally wounded Drogheo. 

The two exchange words and the older man apparently pushes the younger man, the video shows. Just seconds later, a shot is heard.

Drogheo was shot in the torso. Other images captured by witnesses and shared with NBC show a man on the ground.

He was rushed to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Witnesses described the chaotic scene after hearing the gunshot ricochet through the station during one of the busiest travel times of the day. 

Fatima Manuel told CBS she was confused by the sound at first.

'Like a 'pow, pow' sound,' she said. 'Sounded like a firecracker, but then I said: 'No, that's not a firecracker. That's more like a gunshot'.'.

Another subway user, Donny Dushi, added: 'It's the scariest thing to even hear about. Wherever you are in the city - regardless if it's Brooklyn, the city, Queens, just knowing the transportation you take every day, it can happen to anybody.'
