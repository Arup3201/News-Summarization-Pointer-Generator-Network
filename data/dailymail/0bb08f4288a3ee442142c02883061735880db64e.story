The Nigerian military says it has destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza.

The official Twitter account for the Nigerian Defense Headquarters announced 'FLASH: Troops this morning captured Gwoza destroying the Headquarters of the Terrorists self-styled Caliphate.'

It followed with 'Several terrorists died while many are captured. Mopping up of entire #Gwoza and her suburbs is ongoing.' 

Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August. Earlier this month Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, formally recognising Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their spiritual leader.

Goodluck Jonathan's opponents have said the offensive against Boko Haram is a political ploy ahead of tomorrow's election (a billboard for which is pictured). They have asked why Nigeria's military, of which Jonathan is the commander in chief, is suddenly is capable of doing what it has failed to do for six years

It was not possible to verify this morning's morale-boosting announcement, which comes just one day before critical presidential elections in Nigeria.

The Twitter messages made no mention  of military operations in Sambisa Forest, where Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremist group is believed to have several camps.

Warplanes have been bombarding the area for weeks. The forest starts about 20 miles from Gwoza town, which is 80 miles southeast of Maiduguri - the Borno state capital state and Boko Haram's birthplace.

Sambisa Forest is where extremists first took nearly 300 schoolgirls kidnapped from a boarding school in Chibok almost a year ago. Dozens escaped on their own but 219 remain missing.

The failure of the government and military of President Goodluck Jonathan to rescue the girls created international outrage and continues to dog Nigeria's leader as he stands for re-election.

Nigeria's military, with support of troops and military aircraft from neighboring countries, in the past two months has retaken dozens of towns from Boko Haram. This comes after months of defeat at the hands of Boko Haram, with soldiers fleeing the battlefield after they ran out of ammunition.

Jonathan's opponents have said the offensive is a political ploy, asking why Nigeria's military, of which Jonathan is the commander in chief, is suddenly is capable of doing what it has failed to do for nearly six years.

Reports from the newly-liberated town of Bama say the city has been devastated by the militants' occupation and the efforts to re-take the city - with the army claiming the stench of death hangs heavy in the air.

The devastation is visible from the air in Bama. Corrugated iron roofs lie ripped off among charred debris, the walls of the houses blackened with soot or in ruins.

On the dusty roads that separate properties in the second-biggest town in Borno state, northeast Nigeria, the sight -- and smell -- is much worse, with evidence of atrocities everywhere.

The Nigerian military forced out Boko Haram from Bama earlier this month. As they did so, locals who managed to escape said the Islamists set fire to homes, including the emir's palace.

But clearly much worse happened -- and the evidence is on the streets, beneath them and in the parched fields beyond. 

Troops found the decomposing body of a man in a sewer, in the fetal position surrounded by trash and human waste. Soldiers cover their noses as more remains are found elsewhere.

 Earlier this week it emerged that Boko Haram had abducted hundreds of women and children  from primary schools  to use them as 'human shields'.

The Islamic militants took adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak as troops from Niger and Chad approached a month ago, Mike Omeri, the Nigerian spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, confirmed this week.

When the soldiers arrived, they found the town largely deserted - with local reports suggesting as many as 500 people were taken in the raids. 

Mr Omeri refused to be drawn on exactly how many people had been taken by Boko Haram militants, but he was clear on the reason why they had been kidnapped. 

'Boko Haram ... rushed to primary schools they took children and adults that they are using as shields to protect themselves from the menacing advance of troops,' he said.

'They are being used as shields by Boko Haram.' 

Damasak, which is near the border with Niger and had been held by Boko Haram for months, was recaptured on March 16 - but officials have only confirmed the kidnappings now.

Evidence of a mass grave was also discovered by the troops from Chad and Niger, who now hold the town, Chad's ambassador to the U.N. Mahamat Zene Cherif confirmed Wednesday.

Last week, the troops found the bodies of at least 70 people in an apparent execution site under a bridge leading out of Damasak, which had been used as an administrative centre for the extremists who hope to create their own 'caliphate' in the region.

The six-year battle against the insurgents is one of the major issues voters will be considering on Saturday.

Thousands have already lost their lives - including an estimated 10,000 last year alone - while more than 174,000 people are thought to have fled to neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger as refugees.

Analysts attribute the success to newly acquired war materiel including tanks, armored cars and helicopter gunships, training by foreign instructors and a joint offensive with battle-hardened soldiers from neighboring Chad, as well as troops from Niger and Cameroon.

A regional offensive against Boko Haram was mounted at the end of January amid growing international concern as Boko Haram seized territory the size of Belgium.

The terror group also pledged to become the West Africa franchise of the Islamic State group operating in Syria and Iraq, and as the Nigerian insurgents spread their attacks across borders.

At least 10,000 people were killed in the Islamic uprising last year and more than 1.5 million people have been driven from the homes.
