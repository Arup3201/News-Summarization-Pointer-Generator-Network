Bed bug outbreaks have soared over the past six years, with overseas travellers blamed for the increase in infestations.

London and the South East have been the hardest hit, with pest controllers reporting a 108 per cent increase in call-outs.

Hotels and hostels are notorious hotspots and experts say Britons travelling to Asia and South America, as well as foreign visitors from those areas, have helped to spread the bugs.

Bed bug outbreaks have soared over the past six years, with overseas travellers blamed for the increase in infestations

Pest control company Rentokil says the rise could in part be blamed on the 2008 financial crisis, which left hotels with smaller budgets to tackle pests.

The problem has become so bad that Rentokil has launched a new service called ‘Bed Bug Monitor’ - an early detection programme for bed bug activity.

The monitoring service uses a food-based lure which actively attracts bed bugs onto a sticky pad, providing an early warning of infestation.

The lures are placed discreetly around the bedroom, such as under the bed or in suitcase storage areas where the creatures may have hitched a ride in baggge.

The firm says the initiative will enable housekeeping staff to be the “first line of defence” in detecting an infestation.

Bed bugs can lay 200 to 500 eggs over a two-month period, and are often difficult to spot - after hatching they take six to eight weeks to mature and they survive by feeding on blood

Spokesman Colm More said: ‘Contrary to popular belief, bed bugs are not a sign of poor hygiene – unfortunately, they’re a pest that can be inadvertently introduced anywhere which has a regular turnover of people and luggage.

‘The answer to preventing widespread infestations is early detection and dealing with an outbreak as soon as possible.

‘Bed bugs can pose serious risks to an organisation’s reputation and profitability and the longer you leave it, the more expensive it becomes to bring under control and eradicate.’

Bed bugs can lay 200 to 500 eggs over a two-month period, and are often difficult to spot. After hatching they take six to eight weeks to mature. Although the bugs survive by feeding on blood, they can go for a year without it.
