British tennis star Andy Murray will be serving up Michelin-starred meals rather than aces - after buying a luxury hotel near his home town for £1.8million.

The 25-year-old is the new owner of Cromlix House Hotel - a Victorian mansion just a few miles from  Dunblane, Perthshire, where he grew up.

He intends to renovate the venue - where his brother Jamie got married in 2010 - in time for the Ryder Cup in 2014 which is taking place in nearby Gleneagles.

Ambitious Murray has already enlisted Michelin-starred chef Albert Roux to oversee the restaurant and says the venture will bring another 40 jobs to his local community.

He said yesterday: ‘I am pleased to have acquired Cromlix House and look forward to securing its future as a successful business.

‘By re-establishing Cromlix as a leading luxury hotel at the heart of the Dunblane community we will be able to attract new visitors to the area, create a number of new jobs and focus on supporting other local businesses.

‘I’m pleased to be able to give something back to the community I grew up in.’

The 14-bedroom Victorian mansion sits in 34 acres of landscaped grounds within a 2,000-acre estate and includes four fishing lochs and two mineral springs.

The Olympic gold medallist’s brother Jamie married his Colombian girlfriend Alejandra Gutierrez there in 2010, with Murray as best man.

The renovated hotel is now expected to generate significant custom for other Dunblane businesses as it draws a wealthy clientele to the area.

Dunblane SNP councillor Graham Houston said: ‘I am delighted that Cromlix House is being brought back into operation as a hotel.

'It was excellent in its day and was an important part of the community, so it will be welcomed back by all those who used to enjoy it for dinners, afternoon tea and weddings.

‘We are all big supporters of Andy and it is lovely that he is bringing some of his success back to the community, so we can all be a part of it.’

The family who previously ran the hotel said they were 'delighted' that it was staying in local hands

The previous owners, the Eden family, who ran the hotel for more than 30 years, said they were delighted that the venue was staying in local hands.

Cromlix House, which was built in 1874, has 14 bedroom suites, a chapel, reception hall, two drawing rooms, conservatory, dining room, library and meeting rooms.

It shut its doors suddenly on February 16 last year after falling victim to the economic downturn.

Norbert Lieder, managing director of Inverlochy Castle Management, who will oversee the hotel, said he was ‘delighted to be working with Andy in this very exciting project.’

He added: ‘I am confident that, with Andy, we can create a very special hotel in his home community.

‘While we aim to create a destination that attracts visitors from around the world, we are also determined to ensure it remains a venue of choice for local people.’

The hotel purchase is not expected to make too much of a dent in the tennis player’s personal fortune.

Murray has made more than £14million in career prize money, after adding £1.1million from his first Grand Slam title in New York last year.

He has pocketed £6.4million in sponsorship, merchandising and appearance fees over the past 12 months alone.

Dunblane Green councillor Mark Ruskell also voiced his support for the venture.

He said: ‘The Dunblane area is seeing a real resurgence.

‘Cromlix House is much missed locally and there will no doubt be welcome spin-off opportunities for local businesses to supply weddings and other special events.’
