Wanted: Police have issued a Canada-wide warrant for Rocco Luka Magnotta in connection with severed limbs sent to Canadian offices

A low-budget porn actor suspected of sending dismembered body party to offices across Canada allegedly filmed himself hacking his victim's body up with an ice-pick and then posted the sickening video online.

Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, is the subject of a massive manhunt after a man's maggot-ridden torso was found in a locked suitcase by his Montreal apartment block.

The sickening 'snuff video' footage, called '1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick' and uploaded last week, shows a naked male tied to a bed frame being attacked with both an ice pick and a kitchen knife.

The Best Gore website says the film, which is unclear where or when it was filmed, then shows the victim being stabbed and having his throat slashed to the soundtrack of True Faith by New Order.

He is later decapitated, dismembered and sexually assaulted. It is believed he was already dead when the camera started rolling.

The man in the video, whose face is never revealed, then goes on to play with the corpse's body parts in a 'sexual manner'.

Doubt was initially cast on the veracity of the film but police have now confirmed 'it depicts the actual crime', the National Post reports.

Police believe a festering foot from the body was then mailed to Canadian Conservative Party's HQ, and a hand was found at a postal warehouse, both in Ottawa, Ontario.

Officers believe he could also be behind a sickening video posted online where kittens are tortured and killed.

The animal-cruelty video, filmed two years ago, shows a man looking like Magnotta placing two kittens inside an airtight bag and using a vacuum cleaner to suck out the air.

In distressing scenes, too graphic to be posted on MailOnline, the cleaner is then switched on and the air is slowly sucked out of the bag. The mewing kittens can be seen wriggling around and clawing to escape as the polythene tightens around them.

Wanted: Luka Magnotta is believed to be behind a gruesome video showing the murder of a man

After switching off the cleaner, the sick teen opens the bag and proudly holds up the body of one of the kittens for his camera, before displaying them on his bed.

Yesterday, police in masks combed through the blood-soaked Montreal studio apartment where the torso was discovered. A blood stained mattress remained there after they left.

Police Commander Ian Lafreniere said: 'For most of the officers that were there all night long this is the kind of crime scene they've never seen in their career.'

He said they are investigating the possibility that other body parts might have been mailed, and believed the suspect and the victim knew each other.

The packages with the foot and the hand, he added, had been mailed to Ottawa from Montreal. But it was not clear why.

Lafreniere added: 'As a father, I would have trouble sleeping at night knowing that the suspect was in my neighborhood.'

Investigation: An internal shot of Magnotta's apartment, outside of which a maggot-ridden torso was found in a suitcase

Vacant: The tenant of the apartment, Luke Magnotta, has not been seen since the body parts were sent

Manhunt: Magnotta is also known by the names Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov

Police said Magnotta is also known by the names Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov. They described him as white, 5ft 8in tall, with blue eyes and black hair.

His internet presence indicates he is a bisexual porn actor and model.

Police discovered the severed foot after Jenni Bryne, a top political adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, opened a bloodstained box at Conservative party headquarters on Tuesday.

When Bryne opened the box, a foul odor overcame the office. 'It was such a horrible odour. I'm sure many of us will not forget it,' Conservative Party spokesman Fred DeLorey said.

Police said the package was addressed to the Conservative Party of Canada and not to a specific person. Canada Post would not comment on the discoveries.

Eric Schorer, the manager of the building where the suspect lived, said Magnotta had been living there for about four months but had not been seen around in a while.

He said there were never any complaints about noise in the unit, and that Magnotta passed a credit test to rent there. 'He seemed like a nice guy,' Schorer said.

Richard Payette, who lived across the hall from Magnotta, said the door of Apartment 208 was left open for part of the day yesterday, with an overwhelming smell drifting out into the hallway, like bad meat.

For nearly two years, Magnotta's name has been notorious among animal-rights activists looking for a man who tortured and killed cats and posted videos of it online.

Sickening: But the man then seals the bag, attaches the vacuum cleaner hose and sucks the air out of it

In 2009, he posted an article online entitled How to Completely Disappear and Never Be Found; it shares a six-step process for escaping and changing an identity.

It is not the first time he has been in the news. Magnotta previously complained his life had been ruined by rumours he was dating Karla Homolka, who raped and killed teenage girls.

Reports add he may have spread the rumours himself, The Canadian Press reported. Magnotta has no criminal record.
