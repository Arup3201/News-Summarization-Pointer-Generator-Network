Thieves in Amsterdam have targeted Porsche owners – but it is not their expensive cars they are after – just their headlights.

But the lights are not being stolen to put in another car, instead It is believed that the Porsche HID headlights are ideal for lighting solutions when growing marijuana.

The xenon bulbs, which are sold for between $100 to $500 and up, are understood to deliver just-right blend of light and heat for budding amateur horticulturists.

And the high-intensity discharge bulbs give off more heat and require much less power than standard grow lamps, and most importantly they offer the right quality of light and heat.

Making a get away: The thief gets away from the scene of the crime with the lights - but leaves the car

According to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf as many as 20 cars have been targeted leaving plenty of unhappy owners.

Adding insult to injury, prying the headlight from the cars with a screw driver often results in thousands of dollar’s worth of additional damage on top of the cost of replacing the headlights.
