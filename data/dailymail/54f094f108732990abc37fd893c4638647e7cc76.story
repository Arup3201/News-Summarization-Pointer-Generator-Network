Kennels and catteries are so last year – instead, it’s palaces with spa facilities, and high-end hotels with outdoor balconies where owners are keeping their pampered pets.

Luxury accommodation for cats and dogs is the latest trend for holidaymakers who don’t want to feel as though their fluffy friends are missing out while they are away.

And, at up to £60 a night, it’s only for owners with deep pockets.

The five-star venues offer a range of facilities – from gourmet meals, and pampering services, to four-poster beds, candlelit meals, and 42-inch TVs displaying fish swimming and birds chirping.

The Ings Luxury Cat Hotel, in Yorkshire, has been overwhelmed with enquiries and is now booked up until 2015.

Phil Ounsley, 45, and his wife Jo, 43, opened their unique motel for moggies after they struggled to find somewhere to put their own cat when they jetted off abroad.

He said: 
‘We built our cat hotel as a place we would like to take our own cats. 
It appears lots of people feel the same way as we did.

‘We treat all our cats as guests. It is a purpose-built, fully featured hotel, exclusively for cats.

‘We think it is the ultimate cat holiday - a perfect home from home.’

Ings offers outdoor balconies, underfloor heating, double glazing, 42-inch TVs displaying fish swimming and birds chirping, bespoke climbing trees, duck down pillows, designer décor with mood lighting, a la carte menus, and VIP spa packages.

A night at the extravagant hotel in Thornhill costs owners up to £36.

Mr Ounsley said: ‘On Valentine’s Day, guests were treated to a candlelit meal along with a rose, treats and a romantic movie.

‘Owners are kept updated with pictures of the guests relaxing at the hotel.’

 with stress. They deserve a nice holiday, just as much as their owners.

‘For many pet owners, the family cat is like a child, and they naturally worry about them. Owners can't enjoy their holiday if they think their cat isn't having a good time as well.’

Mrs Blair, a former vet, offers nine luxury designer suites for her guests and a range of spa packages.

The hotel also has webcams in every room so owners can see their cat relaxing in the opulent surroundings.

A night in the glamorous hotel in South Chailey will cost pet owners up to £26.

It's
 not just cats who get to relax in style while their owners are out of 
the country - pampered pooches can enjoy their own boutique boarding 
experience at Hayfields Luxury Dog Hotel in Northamptonshire.

The hotel for pampered pooches costs owners up to £28 per day.

Owner Nick
 Amsell, 38, said: ‘We are very lucky to have a huge amount of land and 
we love taking the dogs on lots of walks while they are here.

‘Recently
 one of our guests, a beagle, found himself a girlfriend while walking 
with her here - they were inseparable by the end of the week.’

The kennels at Hayfields boast deluxe beds and plenty of room.

Mr
 Amsell said: ‘Dogs are lovely creatures with simple needs. They like 
fuss and affection so we try and give them lots of love all day.’

Jenny Marriot, 56, of Bristol, offers a more personal service in her own home at the Paw Seasons.During most weeks over the summer Mrs Marriott has eight to ten dogs staying with her while their owners are away on holiday.

The pooches have a choice of comfortable beds or comfy leather sofas to sleep on in the sitting room or the cosy study.

But, at £60 a night, a stay at the Paw Seasons is reserved for an exclusive set.

Mrs Marriott said: ‘When the dogs arrive here, it is like watching kids arriving at holiday camp - they all get very excited being with each other.

‘The breeds all recognise each other. We often find that the labradors will stick close together.‘We keep all the owners informed by putting pictures and videos up on our Facebook page, so they know their dogs are having a great time.’
