A graphic new PSA from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department offers violent advice on what to do during a mass shooting.

The video, called 'Surviving an Active Shooter,' was uploaded to YouTube on Thursday. 

The PSA shows blood spurting and multiple victims left on the ground in a variety of mass shootings. Bystanders are seen using several different survival methods. 

'This nine minute video presentation, which has been in production for nearly two years, is one of the most ambitious projects the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Video Production Unit (VPU) has ever produced,' a release from the LASD says.

Terror: A masked gunman enters a food court and opens fire at patrons in one of the PSA scenarios

Shock: A man who was eating with a woman before the gunman entered convinces her that he will lead them to safety and away from the scene 

Flee: The couple stay low and duck near rows of chairs in order to get out. A female victim is seen lying in front of them with a pool of blood 

It continues, 'The video presentation features three vignettes inspired by true life events and introduces the viewer to concepts such as: cover and concealment, location awareness, and self-defense.'

In one, a man and a woman eat food together in a mall food court when a shooter wearing a skeleton mask on the bottom half of his face opens fire, striking several people. 

The couple are able to flee because they duck low and conceal themselves behind objects during their escape. The man gestures to others nearby to follow through a hallway. 

Eventually, the couple and others at the scene get out of the building and see police officers.  

The video's voice-over narration encourages victims to use cover as they attempt to run - and notes that kitchens and stock rooms often have exits to use.

Another shooter situation in the PSA takes place at a school. At the start, a man sits on a park bench before getting the attention of the person sitting next to him - only to shoot him dead.

The gunman soon heads into the library and lets bullets fly. 

Attack: The shooter sits on a bench and gets the attention of the man sitting next to him, before opening fire 

Aid: The shooter later enters a library, where he shoots a female patron. The woman is led away by another bystander into an elevator 

Follow the plan: The two women eventually get to a classroom and let others know what is going on. A female instructor (center in pink) tells her students to follow a safety drill 

Strategy: Doors are locked and barricaded where possible as the group hides together in a corner 

Approach: Police enter the school looking for the shooter. Eventually they surround him and he shoots himself

A female library patron warns a woman coming out of the elevator onto the floor to go back inside. The female patron runs to flee as well - but is shot in the leg by the shooter.

The PSA encourages people to tend to the injured as long as it doesn't leave them vulnerable to unwarranted danger.

The two women are able to flee into a classroom, and tell the students and instructor what is going on. The female teacher locks one classroom door, gets her students to barricade a door which cannot be locked with desks. She tells the class to huddle together in a corner out of sight and assist the injured woman.

The PSA encourages locking doors and turning off lights where possible - and also warns viewers to turn off cell phone volume.

The shooter later walks through a nearby computer lab, where he is confronted by police and shoots himself. 

Authorities later knock on the classroom door, and the woman passes a casualty card under the door, indicating someone is hurt inside.

Tense: A male employee is seen in a verbal dispute with a woman at a warehouse

Violence: After he is laid off, the man kills the women then exits the office

Casualties: The man soon opens fire on other employees present 

Stuck: A warehouse employee is unable to get out or take shelter, so he grabs a fire extinguisher for self-defense against the shooter 

Strike back: The man is able to use the fire extinguisher and get the shooter's gun on the ground 

A different shooter situation shows a warehouse employee being fired before quickly turning a gun on his employer and killing her in an office. He then walks out into an open area and shoots multiple people.

One employee is left stuck with no way to escape the warehouse and nowhere to hide. The video's narration warns that self-defense may be necessary in that situation.

The man grabs a fire extinguisher, waits for the shooter to approach, then sprays it in his face. Disoriented, the gunman falls with his weapon to the ground. Authorities quickly arrive. 

Video producer Sgt. Harry Drucker told KABC 'We wanted to make it realistic. We wanted to affect people's emotions because that's how people remember things.'

He also told the television station 'What we wanted to do was have a variety of locations that people could see themselves in or places that they have been. Everybody goes to a mall. Everbody goes to a library or school.'

Sheriff Jim McDonnell told KABC 'Whatever the venue you're going to is a potential site for one of these incidents. You can't rule out that it will happen this trip to the mall, this trip to the supermarket, and you need to be prepared.'
