A water ban that had hundreds of thousands of people in Ohio and Michigan scrambling for drinking water has been lifted, Toledo's mayor announced Monday.

Mayor D. Michael Collins lifted the ban at a Monday morning news conference, and said the city's drinking water is safe.

Ohio's fourth-largest city warned residents not to use city water early Saturday after tests at one treatment plant showed readings for microcystin above the standard for consumption, most likely from algae on the lake. Ohio Governor John Kasich declared a state of emergency.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Early Monday, Collins kept in place an advisory against drinking or using the water pending additional tests.

At a 3 a.m. news conference, Collins said it was his decision to keep the advisory in place at least into the morning hours, even though latest test results suggest the algae-induced toxin contaminating Lake Erie had probably dissipated to safe levels. The mayor said two tests had come back 'too close for comfort.'

With the warning, worried residents told not to drink, brush their teeth or wash dishes with the water descended on truckloads of bottled water delivered from across the state. The Ohio National Guard was using water purification systems to produce drinkable water.

Oliver Arnold, of Toledo, loaded up on bottled water Sunday so that he could give baths to his six children, including four-month-old twins. 'We're going through a lot. I know by tomorrow, we're going to be looking for water again,' he said.

Some hospitals canceled elective surgeries and were sending surgical equipment that needed to be sterilized to facilities outside the water emergency, said Bryan Biggie, disaster coordinator for ProMedica hospitals in Toledo.

In 
southeastern Michigan, authorities were operating water stations Sunday 
for the 30,000 customers affected by the toxic contamination.

Drinking
 the water could cause vomiting, cramps and rashes. But no serious 
illnesses had been reported by late Sunday. Health officials advised 
children and those with weak immune systems to avoid showering or 
bathing in the water.

Amid 
the emergency, discussion began to center around how to stop the 
pollutants fouling the lake that supplies drinking water for 11 million 
people.

'People are finally waking up to the fact that this is not acceptable,' Collins said.

The toxins that contaminated the region's drinking water supply didn't just suddenly appear.

Water
 plant operators along western Lake Erie have long been worried about 
this very scenario as a growing number of algae blooms have turned the 
water into a pea soup color in recent summers, leaving behind toxins 
that can sicken people and kill pets.

In
 fact, the problems on the shallowest of the five Great Lakes brought on
 by farm runoff and sludge from sewage treatment plants have been 
building for more than a decade.

The
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a satellite 
image showing a small but concentrated algae bloom centered right where 
Toledo draws its water supply, said Jeff Reutter, head of the Ohio Sea 
Grant research lab.

The bloom was much smaller than in past years and isn't expected to peak until early September. But instead of being pushed out to the middle of the lake, winds and waves drove the algae toward the shore, he said.

'Weather conditions made it such that bloom was going right into the water intakes,' said Reutter, who has been studying the lake since the 1970s, when it was severely polluted.

The amount of phosphorus going into the lake has risen every year since the mid-1990s. 'We're right back to where we were in the '70s,' Reutter said.

Almost a year ago, one township just east of Toledo told its 2,000 residents not to drink or use the water coming from their taps. That was believed to be the first time a city has banned residents from using the water because of toxins from algae in the lake.

Researchers largely blame the algae's resurgence on manure and chemical fertilizer from farms that wash into the lake along with sewage treatment plants. Leaky septic tanks and stormwater drains have contributed, too. Combined, they flush huge amounts of phosphorus into the lake.

Environmental groups and water 
researchers have been calling on Ohio and other states in the Great 
Lakes region to drastically reduce the amount of phosphorus flowing into
 the lake. Ohio lawmakers this past spring took a step toward tackling 
the algae problem when they enacted a law requiring most farmers to 
undergo training before they use commercial fertilizers on their fields.
 But they have stopped short of mandating restrictions on farmers.

The
 International Joint Commission, an advisory agency made up of Canadian 
and U.S. officials, said last year urgent steps are needed to reduce 
phosphorus applied to fields, suggesting among other things that states 
ban the spread of manure on frozen or snow-covered ground.

That
 report came after a state task force in Ohio called for a 40 percent 
reduction in all forms of phosphorus going into the lake.

Agriculture
 industry groups have been asking farmers for more than a year to reduce
 phosphorus runoff before government regulators step in and impose their
 own restrictions.

'We're clearly showing progress,' Reutter said. 'You have to decide for yourself whether you think it's fast enough.'

In
 Michigan, Detroit's 4 million-user water system gets its water from 
Lake Huron and the Detroit River. In the face of the Toledo water 
crisis, Detroit officials plan to review their contamination procedures 
Monday, water department Deputy Director Darryl Latimer told The Detroit
 News. He said it was unlikely Detroit would face a problem like 
Toledo's.

'The system is 
tested every two weeks for blue-green algae,' Latimer said. 'We haven't 
seen the precursors for this type of toxin.'
