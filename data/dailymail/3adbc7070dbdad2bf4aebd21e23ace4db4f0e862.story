Alex Goode has backed the latest measures introduced to improve concussion management in rugby union and warned that failure to implement them could have serious consequences for a player’s health.

The Saracens and England full back — speaking on Wednesday at a Rugby Players’ Association event to promote their Restart charity — has personal experience of concussion, having been knocked out several times in the early part of his career, and had an aerial collision in last season’s European Cup quarter-final which left him unconscious for several minutes.

The RPA, along with the RFU and Premier Rugby, recently launched an online education module which all players, coaches and referees must sit, and Goode says the more awareness that can be raised the better.

‘Concussion is a subject that people are now talking about across the world but we still don’t know enough about it,’ he said.

‘We do know that just shrugging it off and playing on can have a very detrimental effect on your body in the long run. That’s what we need to highlight to everyone in order to stop people saying, “Just get on with it” or “Stop being soft”.

‘People need to understand that when someone’s had a serious head knock they need to be looked after. They don’t want to be visiting someone in hospital in a wheelchair or a vegetative state.

‘It took me having a few knocks and having the symptoms — which are horrible; like feeling distant from people, feeling sick, head rushes, feeling asleep all the time, aversion to loud music — to really read up and learn more about it. Now if I take a few jibes from people I don’t care. Your health is the most important thing. I didn’t want to finish my rugby career at 24-25.’

The RFU say their motivation for introducing the new measures is based on a determination to improve player welfare — not a reaction to a multi-million dollar settlement in the NFL paid out to retired stars with dementia — and coaches insist they would never interfere with decisions made by club medics.

‘Even the top scientists don’t know about this so until we do we do need to err on the side of caution,’ said Goode, 26, who is in the England squad for the QBE autumn series. ‘If parents and kids see someone knocked out and carrying on it sends a terrible message.

‘But what’s happened in the media has made a big impact. We’re getting a better understanding.

‘The coaches understand it too. They are ex-players who used to go back on but they understand now if someone is knocked out they stay off. That’s important.’
