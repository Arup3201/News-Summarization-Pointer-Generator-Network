Lord Nash, the Schools Minister, said pupils who speak English as an additional language (EAL) are gaining better results than other children in the English Baccalaureate

Children who speak English as a second language are outperforming native speakers for the first time in GCSE exams, according to latest figures. 

Lord Nash, the Schools Minister, said pupils who speak English as an additional language (EAL) are gaining better results than other children in the English Baccalaureate. 

The worst performing group was white British boys from working class families. 

According to figures released last month English is no longer the first language for most pupils at one in nine schools. 

In the past five years, the number of pupils who have English as their second language has risen by a fifth to nearly 1.1million. 

Lord Nash said in the House of Lords: 'Pupils with EAL progress very well and have higher EBacc scores. 

'Indeed, sadly, it is many white, working-class British boys with English as a first language who do particularly badly. 

The EBacc was introduced by the Coalition after the last General Election. It focuses on core academic subjects - English, maths, science, foreign languages and either history or geography. 

Despite this, figures for the number of pupils with English as their first language gaining five A* to C GCSEs including English and maths is 60.9 per compared with 58.3 per cent of other pupils.

White British boys who are eligible for school meals performed badly in the exams - only six per cent gained the EBacc last year.

A Department for Education spokesman told The Telegraph: 'We introduced the EBacc so that more young people, from all walks of life, took the key academic GCSEs most valued by universities and employers – and the policy is paying off handsomely.

'Thousands more pupils, especially the poorest, are now studying, and achieving, good grades in these subjects.

'One in seven white working-class children now take the EBacc, more than double the number just three years ago – and have far better chances of succeeding in life as a result.'
