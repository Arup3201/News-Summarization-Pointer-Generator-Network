It's not what those of us who gave the credit card a serious nudge over Christmas wanted to hear - with many businesses set to hike up prices of electronic goods and clothes.

The financial headache caused by the festive season could develop into a full-blown migraine with experts tipping more than a third of outlets will soon pass on increases to consumers.

Cheap televisions, tablets and phones may not last much longer with prices expected to begin rising this year, with 31 per cent of businesses intending to lift their selling prices in the first quarter, while just four per cent are prepared to offer discounts.

The financial headache caused by the festive season could develop into a full-blown migraine with experts tipping more than a third of outlets will soon pass on increases to consumers

Boxing Day sales alone were up significantly on last year, with more than $2 billion having gone through retail tills across Australia. That's up more than $70 million on last year

Dun & Bradstreet's monthly Business Expectations Survey shows the Selling Price Index for the March quarter lifting to 26 points, that's up from about 17 last quarter and 19 last year, to reach its highest level since the third quarter of 2009. The index measures the difference between the percentage of businesses expecting to increase prices minus the percentage intending to decrease prices.

It comes in the wake of a bumper sales period for businesses.

Boxing Day sales alone were up significantly on last year, with more than $2 billion having gone through retail tills across Australia. That's up more than $70 million on last year.

But the lift in the Selling Price Index continues a steady trend that commenced during the middle of last year and can be tied to a similar movement in the level of the Australian dollar; suggesting that the weakening currency is leading to higher input costs for many local firms.

It's not just retailers, the survey showed that 40 per cent of wholesalers are planning to raise their prices in the coming three months, while just one per cent will reduce.

Gareth Jones, CEO of Dun & Bradstreet in Australia & New Zealand, says the falling currency is having a mixed impact on the business sector

According to Gareth Jones, CEO of Dun & Bradstreet in Australia & New Zealand, the falling currency is having a mixed impact on the business sector.

'The double-edge nature of currency movements is being borne out with mixed views from businesses on its effect,' said Mr Jones.

'While there has undoubtedly been a benefit for sections of the economy, such as manufacturers, the weaker dollar has introduced new cost pressures for businesses and industries that are reliant on imported goods.

'To cover these costs, many operations will be forced to lift their own prices, which will in turn flow through to other businesses and consumers alike,' Mr Jones added.

D and B economic advisor Stephen Koukoulas said: 'In the past year or two we have had the cautious consumer, we've all been a little bit worried about a range of factors and, let's be honest, both sides of politics have not made it any easier, with scare campaigns about budgets and the like'.

'One thing that is a little worrying are selling prices, as a greater number of items are directly linked to the strength of otherwise of the Aussie dollar, we are going to be paying more seeing that we import the bulk of electronic goods and clothing,' Mr Koukoulas added.

Steven Koukoulas of Dun & Bradstreet warns: 'You’d be saying that in the next two to three months basic consumer imported items, will see us asking "why is my cost of living becoming more expensive" and it will be a little bit more considering the cheaper items that we bring in.'

It's predicted the spend nationally through and beyond the festive season sales could top more than $16 billion

Australian Retailers Association Executive Director Russell Zimmerman said retailers had seen unprecedented crowds during the recent sales, with many stores forced to restrict entrance due to the sheer number of people already in store.

'While consumers can now purchase almost anything from the comfort of their own living rooms, online shopping can never fully replace the five-sense experience that comes with being amongst the craziness and excitement at the local mall on Boxing Day.'

'Yes things like Chinese manufactured goods are so cheap because of cheap labour and cheaper overheads and they were as cheap as chips when we were above parity (dollar to dollar) but now it's not we face a double whammy - the Aussie is presenting about 20 per cent less value.

'But the good news is that hiring intentions have picked up, businesses can help by giving consumers a job.

'Employment which has been weak in the past year or so – not catastrophic but weak, so if we are getting a turning point on employment that would be significant.

'There's so many conflicting pressures on the economy, the big fall in terms of trade and iron ore prices, the RBA is getting a bit worried, now the dollar is falling, it's a lot to manage.

'On the other hand, low borrowing rates, cheaper fuel and an improving US economy, provide additional cause for optimism.'

The D&B survey reveals the significance of the falling dollar on businesses, with 21 per cent listing it as the issue that will influence their operations the most, with 'cash flow' the only more pressing concern (26 per cent) for their operations in the first quarter of 2015.

A notable concern too going forward is the number of businesses optimistic about growth this year compared to last. That figure has fallen from 74 per cent to 65 per cent month-on-month, and from 68 per cent year-on-year.
