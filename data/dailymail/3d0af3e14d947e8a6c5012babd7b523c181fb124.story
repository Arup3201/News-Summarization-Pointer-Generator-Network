Jamie Oliver's association with Woolworths has hit another snag, with the supermarket forced to undertake a product recall on all plush toys from the Jamie's Garden range.

The range includes eight characters - Orange, Bean, Banana, Broccoli, Beetroot, Pear, Grape and Tomato.

'All eight characters may liberate stuffing during use and the hands and feet are small parts that are inadequately attached, presenting a potential choking hazard,' the ACCC website said.

'In addition, the wire in the bean character could pierce the fabric and cause eye injuries or puncture wounds to small children.'

The products were sold across the nation in Woolworths and Safeway supermarkets from May 21 to June 16.

Another recall was issued earlier this week by the supermarket giant, but it was only for the bean character.

Customers who have purchased these toys should stop using the product as a precaution and return them to a Woolworths or Safeway store for a full refund.

'Woolworths apologises to its customers for any inconvenience caused by this recall,' the supermarket's website said.

It has not been smooth sailing for the Jamie's Garden campaign.

It is not the first time the campaign has run into trouble. Earlier this month fruit growers expressed outrage about a 40 cents a crate levy for marketing of Jamie's Garden

Earlier this month, vegetable growers were outraged by the supermarket giant charging them 40 cents a crate to pay for the marketing of Jamie's Garden, in addition to a promotional fee they were already forking over to Woolworths, Ausveg claims.

One grower reportedly claimed it would cost them an extra $300,000 for the campaign, while others would be paying tens of thousands.

It sparked the group that represents growers, Ausveg, to write to the celebrity chef and pleaded with him to talk to Woolworths about cancelling the fee.
