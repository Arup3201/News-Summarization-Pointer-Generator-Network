Donald Pemberton and Ryan Williams, aged 20 and 21 respectively, were arrested for the 27-year-old's murder at around 2am on Thursday.

They will appear before magistrates in Plymouth tomorrow. 

Mr Bhandari was with friends at the King's Arms on New Year's Eve when the group were attacked on their way home at around 1.30am. 

Tributes have been paid to the 'lovely' builder, who, it was reported, was killed after stepping in front of a female friend to shield her from harm. 

It was claimed the disruption may have started over a request for a cigarette, though Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm this account. 

Officers said last week Mr Bhandari and his friends had been the victims of an 'unprovoked, indiscriminate' attack.

Today, announcing the charges, Detective Inspector Gregg Dawe, Senior Investigating Officer, said: 'An axe and knives have been recovered and searches are continuing in the Milford Lane area for any further knives that may have been used.

'I want to thank everyone who has assisted us with the police investigation so far.

Tanis Bhandari, 27, was murdered outside the Kings Arms pub on New Year's Eve. Relatives have paid tribute to the 'lovely' man 

More than 100 people gathered outside the pub to lay tributes of flowers and cards on Friday morning 

Mourners gathered outside the green where the group of men were attacked today to pay their respects

'Searches and enquiries are continuing in relation to this incident.'

More than 100 mourners gathered outside the pub where Mr Bhandari, a former member of the Royal Navy, was killed to lay tributes. 

Flowers and Liverpool FC scarves were placed on the small village green where he is believed to have been killed. 

Devon and Cornwall Police had been appealing to residents in the sleepy village to check their gardens for a knife used in the attack. 

An axe-like weapon was recovered shortly after the attack last week. 

Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Mr Bhandari on Twitter and Facebook, describing him as an 'amazing friend'. 

Andy Nicholls wrote: ‘Gutted to hear that the victim of the unprovoked NYE attack in Plymouth was a former Navy shipmate. RIP Tanis “Bandi” Bhandari. Sleep well.’

Bouncer Andy Dymond-Park said he was working in the pub and saw the attack happen.

He wrote on Facebook: ‘Horrendous events to witness last night and absolutely terrifying. My heart goes out to the victims and their friends and family at this sad start to the new year after what was such a good night. 

'Bit shaken up by it all but I’m fine, feel terrible for everyone involved. It has just hit hard. Could have been anyone involved.’

Forensics officers scoured the rural village over the weekend following the arrests of two men 

Police are still appealing for information about the attack which took place in the early hours of Thursday morning

A spokesman for the Kings Arms, where the 27-year-old had been celebrating with friends on New Year's Eve before his death, said the men were 'lovely' people. 

'On New Year’s Eve a terrible attack was made on a lovely group of people on the way home from a great night in our pub.

'It was an unprovoked violent attack with a tragic consequences. That I feel devastated is an absolute understatement.

'I wish all the families of those involved my deepest deepest sympathy, not that this will help them in any way now but, I wish I could turn back the clock so that these events would not occur.'

Mourners today paid tribute to the man described as 'kind' and 'peaceful'. 

One friend, who declined to be named, said: 'He was very peaceful and a very relaxed guy.

'I would say hello to him every morning when I saw him. He would often care for his younger twin siblings.' 

Others shared their grief on Facebook. 

'Can’t believe it, I grew up in the same village as Tanis, he’s always been a kind lad, you will truly be missed bud, my thoughts are with his family and may whoever done this get what he deserves,' said Lee Ryder while Colleen Finn added: 'We've lost our jester, I feel ripped to pieces.'
