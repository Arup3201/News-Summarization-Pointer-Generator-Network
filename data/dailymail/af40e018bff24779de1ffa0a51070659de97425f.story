A 20-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he allegedly plowed into two women with his truck while they were out walking.

Jon-Luc Laporte, of American Canyon in Napa County, California, was arrested for barreling into the women at speed and then running over one victim in the parking lot where she lay injured.

Police Lt. Kevin Bartlett said the second woman who was walking with the intended target also was struck by the truck and injured during the Saturday afternoon attack.

Laporte initially fled but returned to the scene and then led officers on a high-speed chase. 

The officers forced LaPorte to stop and arrested him.

Both women survived the collision and were hospitalized with moderate injuries.  

According to the Times-Herald, the woman, named locally as 20-year-old Anna Bond, may have turned down a date with Laporte moments before he allegedly tried to kill her.

Friends told the newspaper that the pair had known each other for years and he hoped to become more than her friend.

The shocking attack was captured on the surveillance camera of a local bar.  

Bartlett says LaPorte was booked into the Solano County jail on two counts of attempted murder. 

He was scheduled to make his first court appearance on Tuesday. 

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Vallejo Police Department on Wednesday.  

The two women were left lying in the road after running over a woman described as his ex-girlfriend 

Prior to the attack, the two women were seen walking along the side of the road on Saturday afternoon
