A young Ferguson activist who met with President Barack Obama at the White House this week is blasting the prospect of a presidential visit to the St. Louis, Missouri, suburb as 'too little, too late' and 'bulls*** symbolism.'

On a conference call with reporters last night Millennial Activists United co-founder Ashley Yates said she and the other young, civil rights activists who met with Obama on Monday did not request that he visit Ferguson because they were focused on getting him to take more substantive actions.

Her comments set of a firestorm on Twitter, in which she participated, sending out a string of tweets ridiculing the media and anyone else she perceived as suggesting a photo op with the president would solve Ferguson's race relations problems.

President Barack Obama met with young Ferguson activists on Monday to discuss issues important to them., including Millennial Activists United co-founder Ashley Yates, pictured here. Yates said yesterday that she and other young civil rights leaders who met with the president did not ask him to visit the Missouri town, calling it 'too little, too late'

Yates, a 29-year-old St. Louis resident, helped found Millennial Activists United after the death of 18-year-old Ferguson resident Michael Brown. 

Brown, who is black, was shot and killed by local police officer Darren Wilson, who is white. After being acquitted last week of criminal charges by a grand jury, Wilson resigned his position. He still faces the possibility of being charged by federal prosecutors for alleged civil rights violations.

The grand jury's decision to let Wilson walk sparked protests anew in Ferguson and led to renewed focus in the White House on the division between law enforcement officers in communities of color and the public.

On Monday the White House announced that a task force would review a Pentagon program that provides excess equipment to police departments amid concerns over the militarization of law enforcement.

It also disclosed a $263 million adjustment to its 2015 budget request to fund up to 50,000 body cameras for police officers.

Obama also held Ferguson-related meetings throughout the day at the White House with members of his cabinet, civil rights leaders of all ages, elected officials, academics, faith leaders and law enforcement officers.

However, the president's spokesman said that afternoon that Obama had no plans of traveling to the Missouri town to try to soothe racial tensions while vaguely acknowledging that the president could change his mind and make the trip after all.

The White House flack wouldn't say why Obama won't visit Ferguson now or what it would take for him to make the journey. 

The side-step didn't seem to bother the president's guests, as the young civil rights leaders revealed on Tuesday that they didn't press the president on the issue.

Calling an Obama visit 'too little, too late,' Yates told reporters, 'What we need him to do now is him use the power of his position, the power of the highest office of the land to enact some real change.

'We have been on the ground making the changes that we can in our community, but these are high-level changes that we need to see,' she said, according to the Associated Press.

'These are systemic issues and we need systemic solutions for them. We need policies. We need the backing of our black president to say that this is a racial issue and that he stands behind us. 

'We don't need him to come and put boots to the ground. He should have done that 100 days ago.'

In this picture posted to Yates' twitter, she stands outside the White House on Monday with other young activists, waiting to be let in for their meeting with Obama. Yates said Tuesday that she didn't press him to come to Ferguson because 'we don't need him to come and put boots to the ground. He should have done that 100 days ago'

Yates' comments set off a firestorm on Twitter. She fueled the fire by sending out a series of tweets explaining her reasoning

After her remarks elicited negative reactions from some of her peers, Yates defended herself on twitter and slammed her detractors for buying into the narrative that an Obama visit is all-important.

'The media continues to push this bulls*** vision of Obama coming to Ferguson and rebuilding it with his bare hands & you fell for it,' she told her followers.

'So folks want to get mad at me for rejecting that bulls*** "fairytale". Let me say it again: there's nothing cute about this police state,' she added.

'So while you all are focused on THAT, you are missing out on the real. They WANT our ask to be some bulls*** symbolism,' she said in another tweet.

Continuing, a flabbergasted Yates pointed out that Obama is perhaps the most powerful man in the world 'and the demand you want met is for him to come shake hands?! For WHAT?'

'We don't need him to come to the terror zone as so many of you have. & he doesn't need to come. He is WELL aware of what we've experienced,' she said.

'An Obama visit to Ferguson is small potatoes. I'm trying to feed my folks STEAK. Never settle. Stop jumping after every bone.'

Yates said on Twitter that given that Obama is arguably the most powerful man in the world, she's shocked that 'the demand you want met is for him to come shake hands?! For WHAT?'

In an appearance on progressive news program Democracy Now! on Tuesday Yates revealed that in her meeting with the president she made a personal appeal for federal action in the name of her young cousin.

'I looked the president right in his eye, and said that I do this work because I want to make sure that unlike Tamir Rice, and unlike Trayvon Martin and unlike Mike Brown, my little cousin can make it home safely,' she said.

Describing the meeting with Obama as a 'frank conversation,' she said the president was 'very receptive and was open and willing to hear our experiences and really get that viewpoint from the other side.' 

According to advocacy website Ferguson Action, Yates and other young leaders in the meeting, which included three other Missouri natives as well as three advocates from other states, demanded federal prosecution of police officers who 'kill or abuse people.'

They also requested independent prosecution of police officers who commit violent acts, taking the burden off of local district attorneys with whom they may be acquainted, and the creation of community review boards that have the power to make recommendations for action against police misconduct.

Also on their list was the defunding of police departments that 'use excessive force or racially profile, the demilitarization of police and new investments in alternatives to incarceration.

'There is no reason that our local law enforcement should have military weapons, and especially in the way in which they've been using them,' Yates told Democracy Now! on Tuesday while advocating for the federal program to be abolished. 

'They were given those weapons in order to fight terrorism, but they are the ones enacting terrorism upon our communities,' she said, and using military weapons to 'oppress American citizens.' 

The White House said on Monday that while it believed the program needed better oversight, a recent review, conducted in the wake of the Ferguson protests, found that it had many benefits, as well.

Furthermore, a 'majority' of the purchases made through the program by local police were not for military-grade weapons, they were for office supplies, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.

While at the White House Yates instead advocated that the federal government abolish a Pentagon program that gives excess military equipment to police

Yates also threw cold water on Tuesday on the White House's funding request for body cameras for cops. 

'Cameras didn't save Tamir Rice. Cameras didn't save John Crawford. They didn't make sure that John Crawford saw justice,' she argued.

The root cause of the division in Ferguson and elsewhere, she said, 'is racism in America, the anti-black sentiment.'  

Brown's shooter, Wilson, should not have been allowed to resign, she said, he should have been fired. 

Instead, he's now a 'much richer man' than he was before because of campaigns started by supporters to pay his legal bills.

'It is profitable to kill a black boy. Not only is it profitable, but you get away scot-free,' she said.

In comments on her twitter after her visit to the White House Yates said the fact that she was invited there shows that progress is being made, however.

'Meeting the POTUS is only an affirmation to me that WE are on the right path. This movement is shifting the nation, we elicited a response,' she wrote.

Still the fact that a few activists 'got to walk into a room called the Oval Office today after 115 days of active resistance. That's not enough,' she opined.

'Think about how ALL of us can walk into freedom by keeping it up. This movement is JUST beginning. This America doesn't work. SHUT IT DOWN,' she added, repeating a catch phrase of Ferguson protesters related to their Black Friday boycotts.

'Without SHUTTING IT DOWN, we would have never been able to walk in that building today. A building my ancestors built,' Yates stated.
