Two New York City police officers were overcome by smoke while responding to a suspicious fire in a residential building in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn Sunday and were in critical condition, according to police on Sunday.

'Police officers Rosa Rodriguez and Dennis Guerra took the building's elevator up to the 13th floor where they were overcome by smoke in the hallway as they exited,' Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said.

Bratton said firefighters found both officers 'unconscious and unresponsive' in the hallway on the 13th floor.

Emergency: Rosa Rodriguez, 36, was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center, Dennis Guerra, 38, was taken to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx

The firefighters pulled both officers back into the elevator and brought them downstairs where they were treated by EMS personnel, he said.

Rodriguez, 36, was first stabilized at Lutheran Hospital and then transferred to Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan.

Guerra, 38, was taken to Coney Island Hospital and then airlifted to Jacobi Medical Center.

Suspicious fire: Firefighters located both officers unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of the hall of the 13th floor

Location of the fire: Both officers remain in critical condition in the ICU

Between them the two officers have eight children.

Both officers suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and the effects of smoke inhalation and remain in critical condition, Bratton said.

Fire officials said the blaze in the 18-story building on Surf Avenue broke out just after noon on the 13th floor and was brought under control within an hour.

'The cause of the fire has been deemed suspicious and is under active investigation at this time,' Bratton said.

Fire Department spokesman Jim Long said three firefighters and two civilians were also treated for minor injuries.

Mayoral response:  Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the officers. 'It's incredibly difficult work that these men and women do,' he said

Louise Harrington, 70, who has lived at the building for 36 years, said cops were going door-to-door looking for information about the fire.

'I heard it was a mattress set on fire. That's what the cops told me,' she said to The New York Daily News.

'I just think itâ€™s evil,' Harrington added. 'Whoever it is, I hope they catch them and they convict them.'
