Eden Hazard has praised Chelsea's 'important win' over Hull; a result which sent them back to winning ways at the top of the Premier League.

The Chelsea midfielder was on target inside two minutes at the KC Stadium to put his side ahead, but the three points were only secured late on when substitute Loic Remy made it 3-2.

Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Hazard said: 'It was important after the draw at home [with Southampton]. We have nine finals to play. We have to win everything if [we] want to bring the trophy to Stamford Bridge.

Loic Remy was brought on in the 75th minute against Hull and had scored in the 77th to make it 3-2

'We know when you play away, it's always difficult, particularly when you play here. I remember last season, the game was difficult. Today was the same. The most important [thing] was to win.'

Remy was only brought on in the 75th minute, and netted his goal two minutes later to secure three points for Jose Mourinho's side.

The Frenchman admits that the goal was his biggest moment in a Chelsea shirt so far.

'Yes, of course. It's a good moment for me,' Remy told Sky Sports. 'I think the work of all the team, we are working properly and training every day to get results and success, so for us it's really important to win this kind of game and we're still on top of the league. We'll keep going in this way and we'll see at the end of the season. 

'It's always frustrating when you're on the bench, but I think we make the difference with the guy on the bench and whoever is playing, no matter who is on the pitch, as soon as the manager needs us we have to be ready for a fight and to win games. It's simple.'
