This bear looked as if he needed a quick rest while putting in some serious time fishing as he grabbed a helping hand from a floating log.

The young bear appeared to grow tired after wading in the waters at Bella Coola, in BC, Canada, while looking for fish.

Photographers Pat and George Walsh said the bear was working hard against the current in his attempts to catch a fish and ended up grabbing hold of a log to keep himself afloat as he regained some energy.
