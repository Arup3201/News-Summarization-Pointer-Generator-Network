While David Cameron was preparing for a grilling at the Leveson Inquiry, Rupert Murdoch was busy sunning himself in Rome.

With a crisp glass of rosé in one hand and sun overhead, the 81-year-old media baron appeared totally relaxed as he enjoyed a family lunch at Le Jardin de Russie yesterday.

At one point the party, which included Murdoch's wife Wendy Deng, son James, and some co-workers  even chinked
glasses.

The firm: Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, bottom centre, raises a glass with his wife Wendy Deng, son James Murdoch, and some co-workers during a lunch at Le Jardin de Russie in Rome, Italy

Looking on the bright side: The Murdochs chatted and joked in the sun oblivious to the fact that a Sun journalist was about to be arrested and three more held over corrupt payments made

Whether their toast at the eatery within the five-star Hotel de Russie, was laden with good news and 
congratulations is another matter.

It hadn't been the greatest day to 
celebrate.

Murdoch's former News International chief executive Rebekah 
Brooks and her racehorse trainer husband Charlie made their first 
appearance in court on charges relating to the phone hacking scandal.

Sweating it out: While the Murdochs lived it up in Rome David Cameron took the stand at the ongoing Leveson Inquiry today

Cause for celebration?

Meanwhile, Culture Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was accused of lying to the House of Commons over News Corp's aborted £8billion BSkyB takeover bid.

The media family's little soiree came the day before  a Sun journalist was arrested this morning and three more people were held over corrupt payments.

No doubt the Murdochs discussed the Prime Minister's appearance at the Leveson Inquiry into press standards over their bread rolls and Chablis, and how he might answer questions fired by QC Robert Jay.

Cracking jokes and enjoying himself: Murdoch laughs as son James cracks a joke during the cosy lunch at the eatery housed within the five-star Hotel de Russie

Relaxed: Murdoch prepares to eat a piece of bread before the party enjoyed a lunch dreamed up by double-Michelin-starred chef Chef Fulvio Pierangelini

Across the pond Another FCC to revoke Rupert Murdoch's broadcast licenses in wake of the phone hacking scandal and damning parliamentary report.

There was some good news for Murdoch amid the misery however.

BSkyB, the TV company which he has a controlling stake in, today announced a £3billion deal for the right to show the majority of English football matches for three more years.

Every cloud.
