Professor Pier Righetti caused a stir after using this image to illustrate his research into coconut proteomes in his Journal of Proteomics

A top Italian professor has been accused of sexism after using a picture of a naked woman holding coconuts to cover her modesty in a paper about protein research.

Professor Pier Righetti caused a stir after using the image to illustrate his research into coconut proteomes in his Journal of Proteomics.

The photograph features a blonde woman who is smiling while standing seemingly naked and holding the tropical fruits to protect her modesty.

The Italian, a distinguished scientist, captioned the image with: ‘Here is your coconut woman, as perhaps envisioned by Harry Belafonte. For its proteome, though, have a look at the report inside!’

Journal publisher Elsevier took to its Twitter page this week following complaints from members of the public that the image was ‘sexist’ and ‘inappropriate’ and confirmed the photograph had been removed.

Responding to messages on its social media page, the publisher wrote: 'They are inappropriate and are now being removed.'

The issue came to light after Rajini Rao, a fellow professor, expressed her dismay at the pictures.

On her Twitter page, @madamscientist, she posted a link to the journal and wrote: ‘A new low for graphical abstracts. Inappropriate image and inane highlights. Did I mention sexist too?’

She told her 383 followers she was writing to the professor and the publisher to urge them to take the image down.

However, a day later she posted a picture which was apparently a response from the under-fire Milan-born professor.

It read: ‘I wonder if you have been 
trained in the Vatican. As you claim to be professor of Physiology, let 
me alert you that this image is physiology at its best!’

The email was signed off with: ‘Take Care, Prof. Dr. Pier Giorgio Righetti’.

Italian professor Pier Righetti, pictured, came under fire from members of the public after using the image in his  Journal of Proteomics. Publisher Elsevier has since confirmed the image was 'inappropriate' and removed it

However, Professor Righetti told The Times newspaper he felt under attack by the response to the racy picture.

He said: 'The world is full of Talebans like those who destroyed with cannon fire ancient heritage in Afghanistan.

He also added: ‘We try to invent graphical abstracts which are different,' before confirming ‘there is no sexism’ in any images he has used to illustrate his works.
