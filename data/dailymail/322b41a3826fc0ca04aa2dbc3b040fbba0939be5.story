A police force has been accused of putting a  sex offender's 'human rights' before public safety after officers admitted they were trying to trace a missing individual but refused to reveal their name or gender.

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed a person convicted of sex offences has disappeared from the Bolton area and could be anywhere in the UK.

But despite a Freedom of Information request, the force is refusing to name the missing pervert or even say whether they were a man or a woman, bizarrely claiming the information was 'personal'.

Greater Manchester Police have admitted they are attempting to trace a missing sex offender but will not release the name or gender of the individual

Yesterday MPs and locals in Bolton blasted GMP for their rigid stance - claiming it is a hindrance in actually finding the missing offender.

Furious Julie Hilling, MP for Bolton West, said the police were offering protection to offenders who have 'broken the rules'.

Ms Hilling said: 'These are people who are not fulfilling their legal duty but their human rights mean information cannot be released.

'It is no wonder they have disappeared and cannot be found.'

Police say they don't name victims to ensure their safety.

If a sex offender was named and attacked by vigilantes they may try to sue  under article 2 of the 1998 Human Rights act which protects 'any person from unlawful violence'.

Angry Tony Lloyd, Greater Manchester's police and crime commissioner, said human rights legislation was never intended to protect registered sex offenders. 

He said he has spoken to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to ensure everything was being done to locate the missing offenders. 

Anger: Julie Hilling, MP for Bolton West, said police were offering protection to offenders who have 'broken the rules'

He said: 'Where necessary and appropriate, police should enlist the help of the public.

'Human rights legislation was never intended to protect registered sex offenders who choose to go off the grid.

'It should never be the determining factor when police consider if they should release an offender's details.

'The police must retain the option to name people who may represent a danger to the public.'

GMP initially refused to confirm the exact details of 23 missing sex offenders from their area - citing the risk of identifying individuals.

Requests under Freedom of Information laws were refused, but police later disclosed that one offender from Bolton was missing after it was appealed by locals on the grounds of public interest.

A police spokesman said routinely naming sex offenders could endanger them or lead to the identification of victims.

Instead they said naming them was a weapon they only liked to use as a last resort.

He added: 'If individual registered sex offenders are believed to present an imminent risk, then they can be named in the media.'

Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick said there were 2,700 registered sex offenders in Greater Manchester, with more than 600 subject to Sexual Offences Prevention Orders.

He said: 'A large proportion of the recorded missing/wanted sex offenders are either known or believed to be living abroad or have returned to their country of origin.

'Of the 23 registered sex offenders registered in GMP whose whereabouts are currently unknown, 11 are strongly believed to be abroad and checks are in place should they return to the UK.

'The remaining 12 are subject to periodic reviews and enquiries in order to trace them and all are circulated as wanted.'

Police justified withholding specific information about the missing offenders because it was 'personal' and would increase the risk of identification.

Shoppers in Bolton expressed their frustration and anger that more information about who the missing person is has not been forthcoming.

Earlier this month, freedom of information requests were sent to every police force in the UK to find out the number of missing registered sex offenders

Local resident Clare Cooke, 32, said: 'How can the public assist detectives if we don't know who he or she is? It's crazy.

'I would be furious if I later found out the person moving in next door to me was a wanted, convicted sex offender.'

Cafe worker Karel Popovic, 26, said: 'Police show pictures of other wanted men and women so why is this different?'

Earlier this month, freedom of information requests were sent to every police force in the UK to find out the number of missing registered sex offenders.

Scotland Yard said the whereabouts of 167 registered sex offenders were unknown and the longest period of time an offender had been missing was 14 years, the force said.

Cheshire Police refuse to name a missing registered sex offender - over fears of a vigilante attack saying one registered sex offender was missing but refused to say when their whereabouts became unknown.

Merseyside Police said three registered sex offenders were missing, as of March 3, and all three had gone missing this year.
