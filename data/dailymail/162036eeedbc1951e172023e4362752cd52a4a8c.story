Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi round 27 occurred at Old Trafford on Tuesday night as Portugal beat Argentina 1-0 in an international friendly.

The world's two finest footballers were the star attractions in Manchester and embraced before the match - both in the tunnel and out on the pitch -perhaps in response to recent reports of tension between the pair.

Real Madrid's Ronaldo and Barcelona's Messi exchanged a bit of a smile and a joke during the game itself. Neither scored, however, and both were taken off at half-time, leaving some fans feeling short-changed. Raphael Guerreiro netted the game's only goal in added time to give Portugal victory.
