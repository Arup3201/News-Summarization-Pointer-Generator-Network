A teenage boy has become the tenth generation of his family to become a fishermen - continuing a tradition going back 350 years.

Levi Miller, whose ancestors have fished off the Dorset coasts since the 1670s, is ensuring the survival of his family’s seafaring past by taking a full-time job on his father's fishing boat.

The 16-year-old, who lives with his family in the picturesque fishing village of Lulworth Cove, has just finished school and says that hauling fish in alongside his father is his dream job.

Levi Miller, 16, is now the tenth generation of his family to become a fisherman in Lulworth Cove, Dorset

Long line: Levi, seen here in his boat Near Enough, is part of a family business that began in 1678

Levi began fishing as a child, since when he has been counting down the days until he could play his own part in the family fishing dynasty.

He says he is proud of continuing the family’s historic line.

'I just love being out on the water, it’s in my blood,' Levi said.  'I have wanted to be a fisherman for as long as I can remember.

'My dad used to take me out on the boat fishing for mackerel when I was just a youngster and I was hooked.

'As I got older I started going out more and more, helping to steer the boat and get the nets in.  I couldn’t wait to finish school so that I could spend more time on the boat.'

Levi will help his father catch mackerel on lines, lobsters and crabs in pots and bigger fish in nets, and the catch will be sold fresh at their family shop.

Levi's late grandfather Jim Miller, who was born in 1922, was the eighth generation of fishermen in the family

He added: 'I’m really proud to be carrying on the family tradition, and I’d like to think that one day I will have a family who will grow up to be fishermen too.

'My job is a bit different but my mates think it’s pretty cool and they often come out with us fishing for mackerel.'

Levi lives with his father Joe, 53, mother Christine, 44, and sisters Sophie, 22, and Becci, 19 four miles down the road from the village of Tyneham.

Ancestor Henry Miller started up a small fishing business in the neighbouring village of Tyneham in 1678.

He handed it on to his son John in the 18th century and after him came his son, also called John.

Henry then took over the trade at the turn of the 19th century and he was followed by Joseph and Edwin.

Charles was the first Miller to go to sea in a motor-powered boat after he installed an old Ford car engine on it in the late 1920s.

Jim succeeded him and Joe became a fisherman 37 years ago.

Joe’s daughter Becci had planned to become the family’s first fisherwoman but chose a career in hairdressing instead.

Joe has now been joined by Levi and the pair spend their days on their 19ft fishing boat Near Enough.

At 5.30am they begin laying crab and lobster pots on the seabed and in the afternoon they use large nets to catch mackerel, tuna and a variety of flat fish.

Levi added: 'We’re out seven days a week if the weather allows - it means an early start and long days but I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.'

Joe Miller said: 'In terms of the methods used, the only thing that has changed from 1678 is we have an engine on the back of the boat where they had sails and oars.

'My grandfather was the first person to put an engine on a boat in Lulworth Cove, using one he had taken out of a car.

'The fishing techniques are still the same - simple pots, nets and lines.

Father and son: Joe and Levi Miller hope they have many happy years of fishing together ahead of them

'Lobster was the mainstay back then, although they would also get white fish like cod, sole and plaice.

'They could earn enough money to only have to fish during the summer but for us it's 24/7.

'The industry itself is going full circle.

'My grandfather would fish the same waters in the 30s and they would pull up four or five lobster in each pot, and it would only be him out there.

'My father and I saw that change as more and more people got into fishing - we've seen a lot come but we've also seen a lot disappear.

'Fish stocks locally are around about where they were back in my grandfather's time.

'The fleet has shrunk so much because of regulations and quotas that we no longer feel pressure from trawlers out in the Channel.

'It's not an easy job but it's our life and we are carrying on a simple family tradition.

'There's still a hardcore few fishing these waters and we're in it for the long haul.'
