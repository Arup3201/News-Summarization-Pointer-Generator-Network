A New Hampshire man who as a teenager became involved with his high school teacher and killed her husband with the help of his three friends was moved to a minimum-security prison and approved for a work-release program.

William 'Billy' Flynn and his friends were allegedly recruited by his former lover and self-esteem course teacher Pamela Smart to kill her husband Gregg Smart. The case inspired the Nicole Kidman 1995 movie 'To Die For.'

The prison classification board determined the
 'likelihood of rehabilitation will be enhanced by participation in the 
Work Release Program,' according to WCVB. He was transferred to a facility in Warren, Maine.

Depending on a work-release program's structure, a prisoner may spend several hours outside of a correctional facility as he or she learns job skills.

Flynn had testified against Smart and said she wanted her husband dead so she wouldn't lose her condo, furniture and dog in a divorce.

Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Gregg Smart in May 1990 and was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison.

Pamela Smart, then 22, began a torrid affair with Flynn when he was 15 and a student in a self-esteem course she had volunteered to teach at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, where she was the media services director.

Flynn testified that Smart helped plan her husband's killing to make it look like a burglary.

He said she persuaded him and his friends to kill her husband so she and Flynn could be together. She also stood to gain $140,000 from insurance on Gregg Smart's life.

Gregg Smart was shot to death at the couple's Derry condo.

According to testimony, a friend of Flynn's, Patrick Randall, held a knife to Smart's throat, and Flynn - after asking God for forgiveness - fired a .38-caliber revolver.

Two other friends, Raymond Fowler and Vance Lattime Jr., were in a getaway car.

Smart died a week before he and Pamela could celebrate their wedding anniversary.

Pamela Smart was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, being an accomplice to first-degree murder and witness tampering.

She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and has maintained she had nothing to do with plotting her husband's murder.

Smart is incarcerated at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York state.

Smart told WCVB in 2010 'I never wanted Gregg killed. I never wanted him to kill Gregg. I never asked him to. I never insinuated that I wanted him to kill my husband.'

'I'm so much more than the worst mistake of my life,' she also told the affiliate station at the time. 'And I feel like I've been frozen in time inside that mistake to get involved with Bill, and I have never been able to get out of it.'

Smart also alleged in a 2010 interview with Marie Claire that that she had been raped by a guard while serving time and had been beaten by two other inmates in 1996.

Smart's spokeswoman Eleanor Pam recently told WCVB, 'Is it justice for the men who are directly responsible for the murder of Greg Smart to be released while Pamela Smart -- who was neither directly or indirectly responsible for his killing -- remains in prison for the rest of her natural life without the possibility of parole?'

The other three teens were convicted of murder conspiracy or accomplice charges.

The case was tabloid fodder and led to books and movies, including the 1995 film 'To Die For,' which starred Kidman as a weather reporter for an affiliate news station who enlists three teens, played by Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck and Alison Folland, to kill her husband.
