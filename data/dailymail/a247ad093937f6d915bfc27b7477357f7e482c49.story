A school named after a heroic pilot who gave his life to save hundreds of pupils has changed its name - provoking fury among pupils and parents.

The Sanders Draper School in Hornchurch, Essex, was named after Raimund Sanders Draper - whose RAF fighter was heading for the building when his engine suddenly cut out at 200ft.

He heroically crashed his Spitfire into the school's playing fields - and only its wing hit the building.

The Sanders Draper School in Hornchurch, Essex, changed its name in 1973 to honour the heroic pilot who narrowly avoided hitting the school. Controversially, it is now going to be called Sanders School

Draper, 29, who'd just taken off from nearby RAF Hornchurch, died to save over 650 pupils and staff at the school.

The crash happened just before 11am on March 24, 1943, at the height of the Second World War - and Draper's noble sacrifice has never been forgotten locally.

Formerly known as Suttons Senior School, the school was renamed Sanders Draper in 1973 on the 30th anniversary of his death.

A plaque at the school marks the point of impact and its badge features a Spitfire to honour the father-of-one's incredible courage.

But now, controversially, it will be known as Sanders School.

It comes just weeks after another school, which was named after a Second World War hero, changed its name.

The John Baskeyfield VC Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was renamed Saint Nathaniel’s after it became an academy.

Today, Linda France, 68, of Hornchurch, said: 'I think it's absolutely disgusting and disrespectful to this brave man to now just name the school Sanders and change its school badge. I find it totally offensive.

'There are some of the children that this hero saved still alive - they must feel the name change is an insult to Sanders Draper and his existing family.'

Mrs France, whose two sons attended the school, added: 'This is a very sad day for Hornchurch and RAF history.'

Roy Marrable, 83, who was at the school on the day of the tragic drama, has criticised the decision.

Mr Marrable, who now lives in York and has early-stage Alzheimer's, hit out through his son Gerald.

Gerald, 57, of Kingston-on-Thames, south-west London, said: 'My dad is very disappointed the school has done this.

'If they are starting afresh there are more important things to do than changing the name. They should be very proud of this heroic man.

'My dad used to go down every year to lay flowers at Sanders' cemetery. That day is still fresh in his mind even though he's now in his 80s.'

Local parents also blasted the decision on a local newspaper's Facebook page.

Donna Slate said: 'It's definitely disrespectful. My girls go there and have been informed they have to have their badges changed on their uniforms.

'I cannot understand why they have changed the name. It's a stupid idea and won't make the school any different.'

Havering in Pictures said: 'This is extremely disrespectful. I've visited Raimund Sanders Draper's grave (to give him his full name) many times and am always in awe of what he did and the ultimate sacrifice he made.

'There doesn't seem to be any reason for the change that I can see either. Change it back I say.'

John McEachern, headteacher of the school which has about 950 pupils aged from 11-16, said in March 2013: 'The school is extremely proud of its association with Raimund Sanders Draper and his bravery and sacrifice.

'We will certainly hope to continue to honour the memory of this heroic pilot in the school for many years to come.'

Two Spitfires (the P7350 at the front and the Hurricane LF363) during the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight in 2010. One parent said the change was 'disrespectful'

But he said last week after the renaming ceremony: 'The renaming was a part of the continuing drive to become an outstanding centre of learning.

'The new school emblem, name and badge all connect together to create a strong brand image for this school that is dynamic and forward looking.

'I am extremely proud of the staff and students who have led this momentous event in the school's history.'

Ken Finding and Jim Ring, who were pupils at the school when Flying Officer Draper was killed, set up the Suttons-Sanders Draper World War II Schoolboys Association in his memory.

A celebration of the school's 75th anniversary last year - which was attended by some of the pilot's family

The group organised an annual memorial service at St Andrew's Church, Hornchurch, where he is buried.

Mr Ring, 84, said last year: 'Every year we celebrate Sanders Draper's sacrifice for us boys.

'It could have been full of fuel exploding, an awful lot dead - there were 650 pupils at the school at the time plus the staff.'

London-born Flying Officer Draper, dubbed 'Smudge' by his mates, was an American volunteer fighting in the RAF's 64 Squadron.

He was the younger son of American interior decorator, writer, and hostess Muriel Draper.

Last month, a primary school named in honour of a Second World War hero who was killed in action changed its name.

John Baskeyfield VC Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was placed in special measures in 2012. It then became an Academy earlier this year.

As a result trustees decided earlier this month to rename it Saint Nathaniel’s Academy because they believed its previous name was associated with its own ‘legacy of failure’

But angry parents, historians and relatives of the gallant soldier - who sacrificed his life for his country 70 years ago at the age of just 21 - have hit out at the move and branded it an insult to his memory.
