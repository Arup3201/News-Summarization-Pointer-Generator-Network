A Florida man convicted of attempted murder in a confrontation over loud music won't be sentenced until after his retrial on a murder charge.

Jurors deadlocked last month on the 
first-degree murder charge against Michael Dunn, 47, in the shooting of 17-year-old Jordan Davis 
outside a Jacksonville convenience store in November 2012.

Prosecutors said they would 
retry him, with a judge Friday ruling Dunn's new trial will commence on May 5.

Dunn had been scheduled this month to be sentenced for attempted murder and firing into a vehicle, but his attorney was concerned that statements Dunn makes at a sentencing hearing could be used against him in his second trial.

Dunn could face a maximum of 60 years in prison for the charges on which he already has been convicted.

Last month, Dunn was convicted of lesser counts 
after the jury failed to come to an agreement on a first-degree murder 
charge against him. 

After
 30 hours of deliberations, he was found guilty 
of three counts of second-degree attempted murder while a mistrial was 
declared on the most serious count.

The 12 jurors also found Dunn guilty of one count of shooting into an occupied car.

Dunn showed no emotion as the verdicts were read. Davis' parents each left the courtroom in tears.

'He's in disbelief, and it has not sunk in,' Dunn's attorney, Cory Strolla, told reporters following the verdict.

Strolla also said that Dunn's elderly 
parents were 'devastated' by the outcome of the trial, adding, 'I have 
no earthly clue what I could have done differently.'

The attorney said he planned to file an appeal on behalf of his client.

Earlier
 in the day, jurors said in a note to Judge Russell L. Healey that they 
were having trouble reaching agreement on the murder charge. He asked 
them to continue their work, and they went back to the deliberation room
 for two more hours.

'I've 
never seen a case where deliberations have gone on for this length of 
time ...' Healey said after the verdict.

'They've embraced their civic 
duty and they are to be commended for that.'

During the trial, prosecutor Erin Wolfson told jurors 
that Dunn's 'blood started to boil' because of the vehicle-rattling 
'thug music' coming from the SUV.

Dunn claimed the 
music, which he described as 'rap c**p', was so loud it hurt his ears 
and caused his car to vibrate.

Dunn
 claimed he acted in self-defense, testifying he thought he saw a 
firearm pointed at him from the SUV as Davis yelled insults at him and 
the argument escalated. No weapon was found in the SUV.

Dunn
 told jurors he feared for his life, perceiving 'this was a clear and 
present danger.'  Dunn, who has a concealed weapons permit, fired 10 
shots, hitting the vehicle nine times.

Prosecutors
 contended that Dunn opened fire because he felt disrespected by Davis.

Dunn
 escalated the confrontation and fired in premeditated fashion because a
 teenager had disrespected him, the prosecutor said.

She
 said: 'This defendant was disrespected by a 17-year-old teenager, and 
he lost it. He wasn't happy with Jordan Davis' attitude. What was his 
response? ''You're not going to talk to me like that.'"

'He took these actions because it was premeditated. It was not self-defense.'

However, Dunn's
 attorney argued that his client used legitimate self-defense after 
Davis let forth with an expletive-laced threat and rebuffed the 
prosecution's claim that Dunn was 'a madman with a gun'.

The teen made his friend turn the hip hop music back up after they initially 
turned it down at Dunn's request. Dunn was parked in the spot next to 
the SUV outside the convenience store.

Reaction: Dunn's attorney said his client was in disbelief over the verdict, which he plans to appeal 

'That
 defendant didn't shoot into a carful of kids to save his life. He shot 
into it to save his pride,' Assistant State Attorney John Guy told the 
jury earlier in the week.

'Jordan Davis didn't have a weapon, he had a 
big mouth.'

The trial was 
the latest Florida case to raise questions about self-defense and race, 
coming six months after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting 
of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, about 125 miles south of 
Jacksonville. 

The Dunn trial was prosecuted by the same State Attorney's
 Office that handled the Zimmerman case.

Dunn's
 attorney told reporters before the verdict that he 
believed there was political pressure on the prosecutors and an excess 
of media attention because of Zimmerman's acquittal.

'I

 believe there is a lot vested in this case, politically,' Strolla said.
 'The case, on the heels of not guilty in George Zimmerman, just 
escalated that political pressure.'
