Steve Bruce has revealed he tried to sign Danny Welbeck for Hull in the summer, but has no doubt he has the class to thrive at the very highest level with Arsenal.

Tigers boss Bruce has history with the England striker, having taken him to Sunderland on loan in 2010-11, and was keen to renew their acquaintance when it became clear Welbeck's Manchester United days were numbered.

He admits Hull's interest never got past an initial enquiry, with heavyweight suitors from home and abroad vying for the 23-year-old's signature, and accepts the player deserves to be among the Champions League elite.

Four goals in six matches suggest he has enjoyed starting as a central striker under Arsene Wenger and Bruce is unsurprised.

'I rang his brother (and agent, Chris) but there was some rather big clubs in for him,' said Bruce, whose side take on the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.

'I think Spurs were in there, Arsenal as well of course, and one or two from Europe as well.

'He had a pick shall we say but, yes, we had a dabble.

'I've got no doubt in my mind after working with him that he can play at any top four side, no question. He's a top player.

'He's played a lot on the left (for United) and then people start criticising his goalscoring record, but you put him down the middle as a striker and he will score.'

The 23-year-old striker has had a successful start to his Arsenal career since his summer move to the Emirates, and on Saturday he will face Bruce's Hull at the KC Stadium 

Bruce, as a former Red Devils captain, was surprised to see his old club cash in on one of their brightest homegrown talents but understands the dilemma Louis van Gaal faced balancing his forward options.

'They've made changes at United and decided he's surplus but I believe he can play in any top team around Europe,' said Bruce.

'When you've got (Wayne) Rooney, (Robin) van Persie and (Radamel) Falcao you've got a decision to make but it surprised me because not often do you see Manchester United selling a very good young player.

'The proof will come over time whether they regret it but I'm sure it will work out for him at Arsenal.'
