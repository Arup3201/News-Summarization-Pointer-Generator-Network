She has previously spoken of how important historical accuracy is to the new BBC adaptation of her book Wolf Hall set during the Tudor era.

And now in a bid to make sure the new six-part series is a true reflection of the period, Dame Hilary Mantel has insisted the characters featured have clean, straight, white teeth.

Inspired by the fictional biography written by Dame Hilary, the story is centred more on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell in King Henry’s court.

Damian Lewis as King Henry VIII, left, and Claire Foy, right as Anne Boleyn in the new BBC series Wolf Hall, adapted from the book by Hilary Mantel. The author has insisted that the characters have clean, straight, white teeth 

Author Hilary Mantel, who says it is accurate to portray the characters with white teeth as at that stage, they ate so little sugar 

Cromwell had been the right-hand man of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, special adviser to the King, but soon Sir Thomas took his place to become the most powerful of Henry's ministers.

Homeland star Damien Lewis plays King Henry VIII in the series, with Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn.

Some critics have pointed out that during that era, it would be unlikely that people had perfect teeth and clean clothes.

But author Dame Hilary has hit back saying courtiers would have had white teeth, as sugar was not yet widely available.

According to the Sunday Telegraph, she told cast members: 'You do not have bad teeth, and you are not dirty.

The ladies of the Tudor court show off their straight, white smiles, which author Hilary Mantel believes is a historically accurate portrayal 

She also explained to the newspaper: 'There are two ways in historical drama: either glamourise them impossibly, or rough them up in some picturesque way so they all have bad teeth. Which, actually, at that stage in history people didn't have, because they ate so little sugar.

'Because in that way the viewer or the reader starts to patronise the people, and think we're more advanced than they were, and condescend into the past.'  

She also added that members of his court would not have been covered in filth as they would have been conscious of their bathing habits.

The outspoken author had also previously laid down the law, warning the BBC not to turn a televised version of her books into ‘nonsense’.  

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in June, she said: ‘As soon as you decide this is too complicated for the viewer, or history is an inconvenient shape and can’t we just tidy it up a bit, then you fall into a cascade of errors which ends in nonsense.’

Actor Damian Lewis, who plays Henry VIII in the drama series, says there was no need for him to fatten up for the role as at the time, the Tudor king only had a 32 inch waist 

Referring to TV series The Tudors – which was broadcast on the BBC in 2007 – she accused its creators of dumbing-down, saying: ‘At some point, someone had decided that it was too complex for Henry VIII to have two sisters, so they rolled them into one.

‘Then they had to find a fictitious king for her to marry, so I think they invented a king from Portugal unknown to history. It’s so shaming, and it stems from not trusting the intelligence of the viewer.

‘I think the problem was that there would be too many Marys in the story. But what do I do? Every second man in Henry VIII’s England is called Thomas.’

Meanwhile Damian Lewis, who plays Henry VIII in the drama series revealed there wasn't actually any need for him to fatten up for the role, as the Tudor king only put on weight later in his life.

The new BBC drama, based on Ms Mantel's book is centred more on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell, played by Mark Rylance, pictured, in King Henry’s court

In an interview with the Radio Times, the Homeland star said: '‘The truth is, though it might be an odd thing to mention, Henry had a 32 inch waist - and he remained that way for quite some time.

‘He was the top sportsman in his court!’

The title of both the series and book comes from the name of the Seymour family seat at Wolf Hall or Wulfhall in Wiltshire, though none of the action occurs there.

The novel was previously adapted into a successful stage production by the Royal Shakespeare Company earlier this year and the six-part series starts on BBC Two on Wednesday.
