Making a splash: Blackpool Pleasure Beach was voted the best theme park in the UK

While the Lancashire coastal resort - famous for its rollercoaster the Big One - was the UK's top entry in the best European theme parks, Paultons Park, home of Peppa Pig World, at Romsey in Hampshire, also made the list.

The attraction came second in the UK behind Blackpool Pleasure Beach and 10th in Europe overall, while Alton Towers failed to make it into the top 10 European attractions at all.

Instead, the Staffordshire Park took 12th place in Europe, and four other UK attractions made it into the European amusement park top 25.

Drayton Manor in Tamworth in Staffordshire was 13th, Thorpe Park in Chertsey in Surrey 14th, Brighton Pier in Sussex 18th and Fishers Farm in Wisborough Green in Sussex 21st.

Blackpool Pleasure Beach and Paultons Park were first and second in the best UK amusement park list, with Alton Towers third, Drayton Manor fourth and Thorpe Park fifth.
