A mother is facing a desperate wait for a heart to become available for her baby girl who will die without a transplant.

Miley Turbitt is at the top of the European transplant list after being diagnosed with the most severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

It is a condition rarely seen in babies, which has caused her heart muscle to thicken and prevent it pumping blood around the body.

The 12-week-old is currently fighting for survival at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle while mother Sharon Eckert keeps watch by her bedside.

Waiting: Sharon with her desperately ill daughter Miley. She hopes every day for a call to say an organ has been found

She is being kept alive with the help of a life-support machine, which carries out the functions that her heart should.

If a donor is not found soon, medics at the Freeman fear she will die.Sharon and father Joseph Turbit, are living in hope that they will receive the call from anywhere across the continent to inform them that a donor has been found.

Full-time mother Sharon, 38, said: 'We all feel totally helpless. I am here every day and there is nothing I can do to help her and it is worst feeling in the world.

'Every day we are hoping and praying we will get the phone call we want to let us know that a heart has been found for her. This is the only thing that is going to help her now.

'It is really hard for all of us, especially Joseph, as he has had to return to work, but we are all just trying to stay positive for her.'

Mr Turbitt, 52, an electrician, is working away, but phones the hospital every day to check on his daughter’s progress.

Doctors first discovered something was wrong when Sharon attended for her 34-week pregnancy scan.

When Miley was born at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Hospital, she was transferred straight to the Freeman, where she was monitored for two weeks before being allowed home.

Mother-of-three Sharon, of South Shields, South Tyneside, also has five-year-old son, Cole, and 19-year-old daughter Yasmin.

She added: 'Because the condition is so rare in babies, no one quite knew what was going to happen.

'But when she was born, she did the opposite of everything doctors thought would happen.

'She was eventually allowed home and she was doing really well.

'But then she was brought back to the hospital a few times, as she was not gaining weight or feeding properly, then things started to get worse.

'I was having to wake her up for feeds and she was sleeping more and more, and she wasn’t looking a healthy colour.'

For the past month, Miley has been wired up to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine to provide cardiac and respiratory support.

Sharon said: 'This time when I brought her in, they decided to keep her in and she underwent an operation to remove some of the muscle from around the heart, but her heart went into failure, and she has been on life support ever since.

'It will be four weeks today she was placed on the machine, and all we can do is sit and wait, and pray a donor will be found in time.'

Dr Richard Kirk, a consultant paediatric cardiologist and transplant physician at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital, said: 'This is a condition that is very rare in babies.

'It is so rare, I have only come across a case of this severity once before in my life.

'Miley is being kept alive by an ECMO machine, which has taken over the function of her heart. All we can do now is wait for a donor to come forward.

'But if we do not get one in time, she will not make it.'

Miley is at the top of the European transplant list

Dr Kirk told how the hospital receives two to three offers of a heart per year and has sent out the alert across the continent in the bid to save Miley’s life.

He added: 'We know when a child dies, it is extremely difficult for parents, and it is even more difficult to ask a parent to then donate their children’s organise.

'But cases like Miley show how vital it is for families to seriously consider organ donation and for people to sign up to the donor register.'

Sharon has made a plea for families to sign up to the donor register and help save a life.

She said: 'I will be honest, until we have found ourselves in this position, I hadn’t thought too much about organ donation.

'It is such a hard thing to think about for a parent when your child has died, but now we are on the receiving end, we see how important this is.

'It is a really hard situation for us to be in, as we are so desperate for a heart to be found for Miley - but we know for a heart to be found, a baby has died.'

Dr Kirk echoed her message saying: 'I would encourage everyone to speak to their families about organ donation, so that everyone knows their wishes.'
