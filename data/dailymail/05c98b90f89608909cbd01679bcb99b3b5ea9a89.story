A California man who was feared kidnapped with his girlfriend in Peru laughed when he learned that family members, who were worried sick after not hearing from the couple for more than a month, had launched a massive search that involved the U.S. State Department and the Peruvian government. 

Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand, both 25, were found safe and sound on a lazy river boat ride in Peru this week. Hand said everything is 'fantastic.'

He laughed when told that he had sparked a major Facebook campaign involving hundreds and caused an international incident.

Desperate hunt: The U.S. Embassy had helped in the search for the young couple before they were found this week

The couple were discovered unharmed after Peru's tourism minister, fearing rumors that the couple had been snatched by 'rebels' would hurt his country's reputation, dispatched two emissaries to track the American tourists down.

Francine Fitzgerald, Hand's mother, said on Wednesday she talked to her son by phone earlier in the day.

'I'm so glad my son is well,' she told KCBS radio from her home outside San Francisco, California.

Peru's tourism minister, Jose Luis Silva, personally intervened in the case after the U.S. Embassy in Lima issued a statement saying that Hand and Neal had not been heard from since January 25 while cycling from the highlands city of Cuzco to Lima.

U.S. officials took action after a massive Facebook campaign launched by the families of Hand and Neal. Facebook posts circulated a flyer with their pictures and pleaded for anyone who had heard from the couple to reach out.

The couple was found on a boat that was traveling along the Navos River toward Ecuador.

They had been updating friends and 
family about their trip on their Facebook page, but those messages 
stopped on January 25, Miss Neal's sister Jennifer Neal told FoxNews.com on Monday.

Jennifer Neal added that Mr Hand's cellphone had been turned off, sparking fears that the two may have been kidnapped.

‘It goes straight to voice mail,’ she told FoxNews.com. 'It's not like them to be out of touch for this long.'

The lapse in communication caused the U.S. State Department to issue a travel warning to any Americans heading to Peru.

The couple were feared to have disappeared in an 
area of Peru where a criminal gang was believed to have been plotting to kidnap
tourists, authorities said this week.

They had also traveled to Chile and Argentina before deciding to go to the Amazon instead of Machu Picchu in Peru.

The allegations of a kidnapping angered Silva, the Peruvian tourism officials, who said he was determined to bring back proof that the American tourists were unharmed.

'It has cost as many years and much sacrifice to put Peru's image at the level it is today,' he said.
