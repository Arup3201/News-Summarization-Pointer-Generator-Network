Britain's biggest philanthropist has cut donations to a children's charity run by his ex-wife following their divorce, it emerged today.

Chris Hohn used to give a large chunk of the profits of his successful hedge fund to the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), which is run by his former wife, Jamie Cooper.

It was reported today that the £16million windfall the charity received from the fund in 2012 dropped to zero last year after the couple agreed to end the donation following their divorce.

The money instead went towards a £26million bonus deal for him and his top staff, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Forbes listed Mr Hohn as one of the world's highest-earning hedge fund managers and traders last year, estimating his annual earnings at around £225million.

The Surrey-born hedge fund manager set up the Children's Investment Fund (TCI) in 2003 with most of the company's huge profits being channelled to the foundation managed by his wife.

It is estimated the charity made around £1.2billion out of the arrangement, including around £800million in 2007 and 2008, which made Mr Hohn one of Britain's most generous men.

But Mr Hohn, who met American Ms Cooper at Harvard University, posted for divorce in October last year, apparently bringing the deal to an end.

Sources close to the couple told the Daily Telegraph that CIFF is now big enough in its own right not to need donations from Mr Hohn.

Mr Hohn came to public attention last year when it emerged his investment fund had snapped up five per cent of shares in Royal Mail.

The revelation increased pressure on ministers at the time over whether the firm was undervalued before its sale.

Mr Hohn was also once described as a ‘locust’
 after he helped to remove the boss of Deutsche Börse, a German firm that 
was trying to buy the London Stock Exchange.

The CIFF and TCI have not yet responded to requests for comment from MailOnline.
