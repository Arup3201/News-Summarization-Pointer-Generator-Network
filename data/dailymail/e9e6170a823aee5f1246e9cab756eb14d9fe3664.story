Formula One driver Nico Rosberg and two of Germany's World Cup squad have been involved in a car accident during a promotional shoot at their World Cup training base on Tuesday which left two people in hospital.

Rosberg and DTM driver Pascal Wehrlein were carrying Germany team-mates Julian Draxler and Benedikt Howedes in separate vehicles when Wehrlein's car collided with two people on a road in northern Italy's South Tyrol region. The road had been closed to the public.

'I am shocked by the accident,' said Rosberg, who leads the Formula One World Championship after winning Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix.
