The U.S. will re-open nine embassies and consulates in the Muslim world tomorrow after closing down nearly two dozen over the weekend amid a 'big' and 'strategically significant' terror threat.

However 19 embassies will remain closed until August 10, following 'chatter' intercepted by U.S. 
intelligence agencies which led the Obama administration to order the closure of 21 diplomatic facilities and to issue a global travel warning
 to Americans.

'The one thing that we can talk about is the fact that there's been an awful lot of chatter out there,' Senator Saxby Chambliss, from the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. 'We didn't take heed on 9/11 in a way that we should, but here I think it's very important that we do take the right kind of planning.'

State Department officials said Thursday that they were taking action out of an 'abundance of caution' from the Arabian Peninsula

The U.S. State Department has warned all 'non-essential' US citizens to evacuate Yemen immediately amid fears of a terrorist attack. It comes as four Al-Qaeda militants have reportedly been killed in a US drone attack in Yemen

Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, the 
top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, 
told ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday that the threat intercepted from 
'high-level people in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula' was about a 
"major attack.'

The 
Maryland Democrat didn't provide details of the threat, other than to 
say it came from 'people at a high level.'U.S. officials are warning 
that a global terror threat from al Qaeda is 'very specific'' and could
 last through August, as at least 22 embassies and consulates across the
 world prepare to shut down Sunday in fear of a possible attack.

'We’re
 not certain exactly where something might happen but it’s very specific
 as to when and it’s also very specific as to the fact that it is going 
to happen, so we have to be on alert everywhere,'  Rep. Peter King, chairman of the 
subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, told WINS-AM. He said the threat is the 'most specific' he's seen since the 9/11 attacks.

'There's
 very little doubt that something serious is being planned,' King told 
CNN. 'It's a potential series of attacks. It could be anywhere.'

The U.S. issued a global travel alert for American travelers on Friday after
 intercepting electronic communication among top al Qaeda operatives in 
Yemen regarding an attack in its final planning stages. The al Qaeda 
affiliate in Yemen has been linked to plots to blow up American-bound 
cargo and commercial flights, according to the New York Times.

If traveling outside the U.S., King said: 'I would let the 
American embassy know where you are. Basically check in and where you 
are and how long you plan to stay there and what your itinerary is.'

State
 Department officials said Thursday that they were taking action out of 
an 'abundance of caution' after receiving information the terror group 
was in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack.

The terror group and its affiliates 
'may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the 
end of August,' the State Department said.

Spokeswoman Marie Harf cited information indicating a threat to U.S. 
facilities overseas and said some diplomatic facilities may stay closed 
for more than a day.

A source told CNN the preparations appeared to have increased in 
recent days with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of 
Ramadan.

A U.S. official noted it was unclear whether the plot 
would be directed at a target inside Yemen or elsewhere.

Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

The
 British embassy in Yemen is to be closed on Sunday and Monday as 'a 
precautionary measure', the Foreign Office confirmed today.

On
 the heels of the American foreign travel alert, Interpol has issued a 
global security alert in connection with suspected al-Qaida involvement 
in several recent prison escapes including those in Iraq, Libya and 
Pakistan.

The Lyon, 
France-based international police agency said Saturday that the alert 
follows 'the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals' from 
prisons in the past month. The alert calls on Interpol’s 190 member 
countries to help determine whether these events are coordinated or 
linked, the organization said.

The State Department issued a major warning last year informing American
 diplomatic facilities across the Muslim world about potential violence 
connected to the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Dozens of American installations were besieged by protest over an anti-Islam video made by an American resident.

In Benghazi, Libya, the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were 
killed when militants assaulted a diplomatic post. The administration no
 longer says that attack was related to the demonstrations.

The United States is locking down its
 embassies and consulates throughout the Muslim world on Sunday after 
receiving an unspecified threat, officials said.

Quoted by ABC News, one official said the closures were a response to a 'specific threat against a U.S. embassy or consulate,' described as a 'concerted effort' to target an embassy or consulate in a Muslim country.

On Sunday  20 US embassies and consulates were closed after conversations between two senior al-Qaeda figures. The U.S. Embassy in Amman (pictured), the capital of Jordan, is among those closed

In Kabul, Afghanistan, where thousands of U.S. troops remain stationed, the U.S. Embassy (pictured) will also be closed this Sunday

The official also said that 'there could be other targets, not just embassies'.

According to the news service, 28 U.S. installations will close Sunday, including  offices in Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

The threat comes close to a year after four American consulate workers in Libya were killed in a night time arson attack.

The State Department issued a major warning last year informing American diplomatic facilities across the Muslim world about potential violence connected to the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Dozens of American installations were besieged by protest over an anti-Islam video made by an American resident.

In Benghazi, Libya, the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed when militants assaulted a diplomatic post.

An armed mob attacked and set fire to the consulate building in their protest against the amateur film - deemed offensive to Islam's prophet, Muhammad - after similar protests in Egypt's capital.

The administration no longer says that attack was related to the demonstrations.

The mass closure of U.S. embassies and consulates across the MENA region also comes almost 15 years ago to the day that hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous terrorist attacks, conducted by al Qaeda, on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam.

In Dar es Salaam, 10 Tanzanians were killed and more than 85 Americans and Tanzanians were injured. The blast at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi killed at least 212 people and wounded an estimated 4,000.

In his recent visit to Africa, U.S. President Barack Obama paid his respects to those who lost their lives in the attacks.

In Britain, the Foreign Office said it was not shutting any embassies but has urged its staff in the Middle East and in Arab states to be vigilant.

'US Embassies in the region have been instructed to close on Sunday August 4. The British Embassies remain open, but staff have been advised to exercise extra vigilance as we approach Eid,' a spokesman said.

‘We are aware of reports and are in close contact with the US authorities. We will consider every Embassy on case by case basis; clearly the safety of our staff overseas is our highest priority.

'Our travel advice remains under constant review. We are not going to comment on intelligence matters.'
