Facing jail: David Chatwood (above) has admitted his part in a plot to steal £1.1million in gold and silver bullion from a company in Belgium

Two men today admitted plotting with the stepdad of The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billie Faiers to steal £1.1million in gold and silver bullion today.

David Chatwood, who was arrested last year at the home he shares with the two celebrities in Brentwood, Essex, has already pleaded guilty to his part in the international conspiracy to snatch the precious metal bars in Belgium.

The gullion were stolen from a lorry in Antwerp on October 19 last year while it was being transported to the UK.

In April this year Chatwood, 58, and three other men - Brian Mulcahy, 46, Stanley Rose, 75, and 55 year-old David Gale - pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to steal.

Today Gary Cummings, 51, and Matthew Middleton, 42, also entered guilty pleas to the same count.

Four others, John Corley, 52, Sheron Mancini, 53, Kayracos Nicolas, 30, and his father Andreas Nicolas, 50, are due to stand trial next month.

Corley, Kayracos Nicolas and Mancini are accused of two counts of conspiracy to steal between June 1 and October 14, 2011, and one of conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert or transfer criminal property.

Hatch, Brentwood; Mulcahy, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex; Gale, from 
Essex, and Cummings, from Ilford, Essex, will be sentenced after the

Kayracos Nicolas, from Winchmore Hill, north London; Andreas Nicolas, 
from Duxford, Cambs; Mancini, from Roydon, Harlow, Essex, are due to go 
on trial on September 10, 2012.
