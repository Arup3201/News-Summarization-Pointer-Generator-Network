Nigel Farage was last night at the centre of a new racism storm over shocking remarks made by UKIP officials about Nelson Mandela and the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.

One mocked Mr Lawrence as ‘Saint Stephen’ and said his grieving mother was ‘boring us all to tears’.

Another, writing just days after Mandela’s death, said that some ‘base-born’ people were ‘intended by nature’ to be ‘slaves’.

Opponents said that the remarks – made on an internal party forum used by senior figures, including party leader Mr Farage – revealed the ‘true face’ of the party.

Some of the most shocking messages concerned Mr Lawrence, who was killed in a racist attack in South London in 1993.

Pamela Preedy, secretary of UKIP’s Redcar branch, wrote: ‘The image of Stephen Lawrence has been promoted to sainthood, with his own memorial site, constant invocation of his name in any discussion of racism; even to close down a discussion about immigration when the issue bore no relevance to his murder’.

Disrespectful: Pamela Creedy, the secretary of UKIP's Redcar branch, referred to the murder victim as 'Saint Stephen'

Ms Preedy then accused David Cameron of ‘worshipping at the shrine of Saint Stephen’, complaining that ‘we are supposed to publicly mark the anniversaries of his death .  .  . Please give it a rest!’

Ms Preedy added in the message, left last year: ‘I’m sure his mother still grieves for him, but it’s time she did it privately without setting him up as some kind of media icon. She risks .  .  . boring us all to tears.’

Another contributor to the forum, Keith Woods, a UKIP council election candidate, commented as part of the same exchange: ‘As for St Stephen of Racism, I feel sorry for the parents of many white youths that have been murdered .  .  . no one seems to give a toss .  .  . your son gets murdered, you become an expert on race relations it seems .  .  . but only  if you are a particular colour’.

The death of former South African President Nelson Mandela last month prompted some UKIP members to discuss whether it was ‘time for a reappraisal’ of the reviled apartheid system.

David William Griffiths, a member of UKIP’s West London branch, used the site to argue that some people were ‘intended by nature’ to be slaves and were ‘marked out for subjection’ from birth.

He went on to quote selectively from Hindu literature to argue that a ‘base-born man’ can ‘never conceal his real nature’.

He concluded with the offensive line: ‘That kingdom in which such b*******, sullying [the purity of] the castes, are born, perishes quickly together with its inhabitants.’

The word b******* has been removed from the quote, on the grounds that it was ‘offensive language’ which had been ‘auto-deleted’.

Other postings appear to confirm the claims of UKIP’s opponents that many of its activists back the policies of openly racist far-Right groups such as the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL).

One councillor, who uses the online name Icini123, boasted: ‘Some individuals who voted for BNP in desperation, because there was no other alternate where we didn’t stand, have come over to us now.’

Outrage: Veteran anti-apartheid campaigner Peter Hain said the comments showed 'the true face of UKIP'

Martin Caine, a UKIP committee member in Poole & Mid Dorset, wrote: ‘I actually agree with the EDL on what they protest about.’

And Alexander Monk, a UKIP member from Lowestoft, said: ‘What really grinds my gears about it is people are declaring the EDL as “extremist” which is tosh in my eyes.’

And in a message earlier this month, Brian Otridge, who is a campaign manager for UKIP’s North West Hampshire Branch, declared UKIP should be directly targeting BNP voters in the wake of their leader, Nick Griffin, being declared bankrupt.

New force: Mr Farage vowed to start a campaign for the 2015 General Election to ¿pick off¿ vulnerable seats, including several held by Labour

Noting that the BNP received hundreds of thousands of votes in the 2010 General Election, Mr Otridge said: ‘We should be picking up 50-75 per cent of those now.’

Last night, veteran anti-apartheid campaigner Peter Hain said: ‘This is the true face of UKIP. Under their thin veil of respectability lurks rampant bigotry and prejudice, fed by disenchantment and feelings of social injustice.

‘None of these comments surprise me, because whenever I speak out about apartheid I am bombarded with bigoted and quasi-racist tweets from UKIP supporters.’

Last month this newspaper revealed that Victoria Ayling, an ally of Mr Farage, had been captured on video saying of immigrants: ‘I just want to send the lot back.’

Mr Farage vowed yesterday to start a new targeted campaign for the 2015 General Election to ‘pick off’ vulnerable seats, including several held by Labour.

He declared: ‘This party feels itself to be a new force in British politics. The goal is to get enough representation in Westminster to make the difference.’

Last night, commenting on the forum posts, a UKIP spokesman said: ‘UKIP does not endorse any of the comments made on this forum which go against the party’s principles and core values.

‘However, the party does not police open discussions. Where elected representatives or party figures make comments bringing the party into disrepute, we act accordingly.’
