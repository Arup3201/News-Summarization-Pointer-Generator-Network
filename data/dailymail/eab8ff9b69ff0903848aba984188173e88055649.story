The build-up to England midfielder Karen Carney's possible 100th cap has been soured by a ruling that she told an opponent to 'f*** off back to Spain'.

The Birmingham City player was suspended for a domestic match last month and fined after being found guilty of misconduct for using abusive and/or insulting words towards an opposing player.

Now the Football Association has published the full written reasons for the verdict of its regulatory commission, which held a disciplinary hearing on October 14.

A 17-page document reveals that Carney, during a Women's Super League match against Bristol Academy in July, was found to have told Natalia Pablos Sanchon, a Spaniard, to 'f*** off back to Spain'.

The incident occurred as the pair were involved in a series of exchanges late in the match.

Carney contended that she said, 'Go back to Spain' but in bringing the charge the FA noted that even those words could still be construed as insulting on grounds of nationality. There was no suggestion the words were considered racist.

After obtaining witness statements the commission ruled, on the balance of probabilities, that Carney had used the expletive in her remark.

But it did acknowledge there were 'significant' mitigating factors which meant her subsequent ban was for one match, rather than the mandatory two it would have been had the referee heard the comment. Carney was also fined £450 and asked to attend an education course.

The publication of the written reasons comes just days before Carney, who has 99 England caps, hopes to reach her century of international appearances against Germany at Wembley.

The England women's side's first match at the national stadium is a record 55,000 sell-out.
