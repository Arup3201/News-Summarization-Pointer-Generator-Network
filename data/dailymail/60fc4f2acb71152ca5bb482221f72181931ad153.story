To boldly go where no man has gone before is quite a challenge.

But to boldly go knowing that you will never return to Earth may be  asking a bit too much.

This has not deterred a Dutch-led research institute, however, which has launched a search for volunteers to take part in a one-way mission to Mars... where they would set up a human settlement.

Mars One says it is not necessary to have military training nor experience in flying aircraft nor even a science degree.

Candidates must:

'Be at least 18 years of age, have a deep sense of purpose, willingness to build and maintain healthy relationships, the capacity for self-reflection and ability to trust.

They must be resilient, adaptable, curious, creative and resourceful.

Mars One is not seeking specific skill sets such as medical doctors, pilots or geologists.

Rather, candidates will receive a minimum of eight years extensive training while employed by Mars One.

While any formal education or real-world experience can be an asset, all skills required on Mars will be learned while in training'

Successful candidates will have to undergo eight years of training before blast-off in 2023.

The Mars One Institute pulled no 
punches yesterday: ‘They should realise that if this project is 
successful, they won’t be coming back.’

Former NASA researcher Norbert Kraft,
Mars One’s medical director, said: ‘Gone are the days when bravery and 
the number of hours flying a supersonic jet were the top criteria for 
selection.

'Now, we are more concerned with how 
well each astronaut works and lives with the others – and for a lifetime
of challenges ahead.’

Mars One aims to raise money to help 
fund the project through a long-running, global, reality TV show, which 
will select the first 24 candidates and follow their training.

Viewers would vote for who should be 
on the first team of four to leave Earth in ten years time. By 2033 the 
colony would reach 20 settlers.

Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days.

Settlers would encounter a barren, 
cratered landscape, an unbreathable atmosphere made up of 95 per cent 
carbon dioxide and temperatures ranging from 35C to minus 135C.

The mission will begin with a landing rover set to launch in 2018 to scour the planet looking for a suitable landing site

This will be followed, also in 2018, by a supply ship carrying supplies

In 2021 all the components of the settlement reach their destination in six separate landers. Two living units, two life support units, a second supply unit, and another rover arrive on Mars
