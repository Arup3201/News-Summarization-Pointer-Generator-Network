A Somali-American who was killed fighting for ISIS in Syria cleaned jetliners for Delta Airlines before he left the United States to fight for the Islamic terrorist group, it has been revealed.

Abdirahmaan Muhumed, 29, had security clearances that granted him special access to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in his job with Delta Global Services, KMSP-TV reports.

Muhumed left Minneapolis and his nine children late last year to fight for ISIS, which is responsible for beheading two American journalists and slaughtering thousands of innocent civilians as its brutal fighters took control of large swaths of Syria and northern Iraq.

Fight or flight: Abdirahmaan Muhumed, pictured here in Syria, had special access to planes and the tarmac at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport before he joined the brutal terrorist group ISIS

Muhumed worked for Delta Global Services, which cleans and re-stocks Delta planes, according to KMSP-TV

Recently, ISIS has offered direct threats to America, posting pictures of the White House and other U.S. landmarks and saying ominously: 'We are in your state, we are in your cities, we are in your streets.' 

KMSP reports that multiple sources have revealed that Muhuhmed had unfettered access to jetliners at the airport, which handles 90,000 passengers a day. He also had access to the tarmac and special security clearance to other parts of the airport. 

One of the last photos of Muhumed is a propaganda picture circulated on social media that shows him standing on a hill in Syria and holding an AK-47 rifle in the air.

KMSP reported that it appears Muhumed had no criminal record in the United States that would have prevented him from getting a job at the airport.  

Delta Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline.

Muhumed, 29, left behind his nine children to fight with the brutal terrorist group, which is attracting fighters from around the world with its social media campaign

Two weeks ago, Muhumed's family was sent a picture of his body, confirming he had died.  He is the second American killed fighting for ISIS. Last week, it emerged that Douglas McArthur McCain, who was also from Minneapolis, had been killed after taking up arms with the terrorist group.

At least 15 men and one woman from Minneapolis have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, according to authorities.

Most of the fighters are from the city's large Somali refugee population. 

On Tuesday, a British ISIS fighter beheaded Steven Sotloff, the second American journalist killed in two weeks. The group vowed to kill more Americans if the U.S. government doesn't end its campaign of bombing ISIS targets in Iraq.
