The swimsuit designer who drowned in the tub of a trendy Manhattan hotel wrote her accused killer lover a lengthy and very specific to-do list demanding he get his act together not long before she was killed.

Swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay died in the posh Soho House hotel in 2010 and boyfriend Nicholas Brooks, 27, is now on trial for strangling and drowning her in the room’s bathtub. Her five-page list of to-dos was presented as evidence in the first day of court that their relationship had serious problems.

The list, found at the 33-year-old slain designer’s desk, was read by her emotional older brother Patrick Orlando in State Supreme Court in Manhattan Friday.

Drowned: Slain fashion designer Sylvie Chachay wrote exhaustive to-do list to her lover of 6-months, Nicholas Brooks, who stands accused of strangling and drowning Cachay soon after in a posh Manhattan hotel room

Her pleas: Brooks, pictured here at his 2010 arraignment and now 27, has been characterized as a layabout partier and Cachay's 5-page list included 'get a job,' 'wake up by 10,' and 'get out of bed.'

‘Get a job,’ read the list Cachay hand-wrote to Brooks.

Brooks, who was 24 at the time of Cachay’s death, has been characterized by prosecutors, as well as the press, as a layabout who spent his nights partying and days sleeping.

‘Wake up by 10 am and get out of bed,’ continued the list.

Orlando sobbed, reports the New York Post, and read intimate details of Cachay’s mere 6-month relationship with Brooks. ‘Hold me after sex and say sweet things. . .’ the list read.

The exhaustive list continued. ‘Do not overuse paper towels…Take me on dates!...No random over drinking or drug use . . . Every now and then spray bug spray…Seriously clean up after yourself.’

Tearful: The lengthy list of to-dos was read by Cachay's brother on the first day of the trial of Brooks as the dead designer's mother, pictured here walking into court Friday, and father listened

One item in particular spoke to Cachay’s apparent desperation to stay with the man with whom she told a friend she had ‘crazy chemistry, but way too crazy.’

‘Show me that I should be with you,’ she wrote. But other evidence shows something other than Brooks’ laziness finally broke Cachay’s desire to be with the younger playboy.

Bearing the subject line, ‘F*** you,’ Cachay wrote Brooks a furious email just 18 hours before her demise, one the prosecution is using to prove his motive for murder.

The email read: 'For the past six months I have supported you financially and emotionally. The fact that u cheated on me makes me sick and you will f***ing pay.’

And she told him exactly how she would be getting her revenge.

Spurned: Cachay, 33, was found strangled in a bathtub at the exclusive Soho House Hotel, pictured, in Manhattan on December 2010 hours after threatening to turn Brooks into police for stealing her credit card

'Get a job': Soon after Cachay wrote Brooks a 5-page list of ways he needed to get his act together, she was murdered and Brooks now stands accused of strangling her in a hotel bathtub. Just prior to the murder, Cachay wrote Brooks an email accusing him of cheating and threatening to get him arrested

‘I am speaking with the credit card company and the police and I am going to tell them that I never allowed you to use my card. I don’t care. Have fun in jail.’

Less than a day later, she would be dead and half naked, face up in an overflowing bathtub on December 9, 2010.

In the hours after Cachay was found, Brooks gave several statements to New York police that could be used against him in court.

He told police, after returning to the hotel after 5am, that he had had left his girlfriend at the hotel to go out drinking the night of her death and that she was sleeping - not taking a bath - when he left.

Several minutes after he was seen leaving on the hotel's surveillance cameras, guests began to complain about water leaking through the ceiling from the couple's room upstairs.

Day in court: Cachay's mother entered court the first day of the trial of Nicholas Brooks in the murder of her daughter in the bathtub of exclusive Manhattan hotel Soho House

Motive? Brooks has been characterized by the prosecution as a partier who was living off of Cachay and feared losing his 'meal ticket'

Prosecutors say Brooks’s DNA was found on the bathtub.

Before Cachay’s brother’s tearful moment in court, her father gave the trial’s first testimony and instisted he daughter never took baths, only showers.

‘Listen,’ shouted the Peruvian-born Dr. Antonio Cachay during cross-examination by the defense, ‘I know my daughter since she was born!’

It is the prosecution’s argument that Brooks forced Cachay into the tub that night, fully intent on killing her.

Miss Cachay, whose designs have been worn by a string of celebrities, was found, according to investigators, with had red marks around her neck and a bite mark on her hand when her body was found.

Cut down: Cachay was a promising swimsuit designer for Victoria¿s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and her own label Syla before her 2010 murder

On the night of her death, Cachay and Brooks checked into the hotel after a fire in her apartment. Police allege Brooks left her there to die while he went to party.

Cachay lived in an apartment in Manhattan's West Village and had a membership at the Soho House, an elite club and hotel that has hosted such stars as Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham and Naomi Watts.

She made swimsuits for Victoria’s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and lastly for Syla, her own label.

Brooks’ father, Joseph, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' committed suicide in 2011 amid multiple charges of sexual assault.

Joseph was charged with 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, and other crimes.

The younger Brooks is facing 25 years to life in prison, if convicted. The trial is expected to last for several more weeks.

Heir apparent? Brooks, seen here just after his 2010 arrest, was the son of Joseph Brooks, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' but who killed himself in 2009 before he could stand trial for multiple sex crimes
