Video footage has emerged of the moment Reese Witherspoon got into a drunken confrontation with a police office which resulted in her arrest for disorderly conduct.

The one and a half minute film, taken from the patrol car's dash camera and posted on TMZ, shows Reese slurring and screaming at a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia following her husband Jim Toth's arrest for DUI.

Reese was arrested for on April 19 after disobeying an officer's order to stay in the car.

After repeated requests from the police officer and her husband to stay quiet, her antagonistic exchange with the police officer ended in her being handcuffed and charged. 

Furious: The moment captured on the police car's dash camera which shows Reese Witherspoon (bottom right) arrested for disorderly conduct

In the video, an agitated Reese attempts to protest after husband Jim was handcuffed after failing a field sobriety test.

The officer told the actress several times to sit down and stay in the car, much to her chagrin.

'I'm pregnant and I need to use the restroom,' she calls to the officer
 - something she told GMA on Thursday morning was untrue.

Seemingly unable to listen, Reese gets out of the car and begins arguing with the officer who promptly arrests her.

Hands behind your back: Reese was enraged at her arrest and accused the officer of harassment 

Do you know my name? Reese was incensed when the officer did not appear to care that she is a famous movie star

Officer: 'Get back in that car. I'm not going to repeat myself again. If you get out of the car again, I'm going to arrest you.'Reese: I'm pregnant and I need to use the restroom.'Officer: 'There ain't nowhere to use it out here. If I tell you again, I'm going to arrest you. Reese: 'Do you know my name sir?'Officer: 'Don't need to know.'Reese: 'You don't NEED to know my name?'Officer: 'Not quite yet."Reese: 'Oh really? Okay. You're about to find out who I am.'Reese: 'You are harassing me as an American citizen. I have done nothing against the law.'Officer: 'Yes you did, you didn't obey my orders.'Reese: 'I have to OBEY your orders?'Reese: 'I'm now being arrested and handcuffed?'Reese: 'I'm a U.S. citizen ... I'm allowed to stand on American ground and ask any question I want to ask. You better not arrest me.'Reese: 'I'm being anti-American?'Officer: 'Yes, please sit down.'Reese: 'Wow! Interesting. Reese: 'You're harassing me as an American citizen'

Officer: 'I tried.'Jim Toth: 'I'm sorry. I had absolutely nothing to do with that.'

'Do you know my name sir?' she asks the policeman, who responds with a curt, 'Don't need to know.'

'You don't NEED to know my name?' an incredulous Reese asks. 'You're about to find out who I am.'

Clearly furious at being handcuffed, the actress begins to indignantly accuse the officer of harassment.

'I'm a U.S. citizen... I'm allowed to stand on American ground and ask any question I want to ask,' she screams. 'You're harassing me as an American citizen. You better not arrest me.'

Even more damming for the Oscar winning actress was her husband's rather embarrassed reaction to her outburst after Reese is handcuffed.

'I'm sorry. I had absolutely nothing to do with that,' Toth told the officer.

Meanwhile, Reese pleaded 'no contest' to charges stemming from her disorderly conduct arrest two weeks ago.

The actress was not in the Atlanta court to hear her lawyer Bruce Morris enter the plea on Thursday.

She was ordered to pay a $213 fine on the charge of 'physical obstruction of another,' according to TMZ who released an explosive video of the star's arrest.

However, Toth was in court to enter a guilty plea for driving under the influence.

The judge told him: 'Consider yourself fortunate you didn't injure your passenger [Reese] and didn't kill anyone'

Toth,
 a talent agent for CAA, received no jail time, but must perform 40 
hours of community service and attend an alcohol education programme.

He has also been placed on probation for 12 months.

Just hours earlier, Reese appeared on Good Morning America in her first interview since her arrest.

Speaking publicly for the first time 
about the incident, she said: 'It was just one of those nights - we went
 out to dinner and had one too many glasses of wine.

'We thought we were 
OK to drive but we definitely were not. We are just so sorry this 
happened. We know better than that. It's something that will absolutely never happen again.

'I
 had no idea what I was thinking that night. I saw him arrest my husband
 and I just panicked. I said all kinds of crazy things to the officer. I
 even told him I was pregnant. I am not pregnant!'

Subdued: Reese looked rather less animated back on the set of her film The Good Lie on Thursday in Atlanta, compared to her performance in the dashcam video

When asked 
what she said to her children about the incident, the actress told ABC: 
'The worst part was having to speak to the kids.

'We
 are so embarrassed by it but we just had to tell them that when you 
make a mistake, you have to take responsibility. We were honest with 
them.'

She has two children aged 13 and nine with her first husband Ryan Phillippe and an eight-month-old baby with Toth.

Reese said: 'It was just one of those nights - we went out to dinner and had one too many glasses of wine. We thought we were OK to drive but we definitely were not'

Exit: Reese smiled from behind sunglasses as she left ABC's studios after her appearance on GMA

The officer on the scene claims that the actress became clearly agitated and eventually disobeyed his verbal commands.

He
 reported: ‘Mrs Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that 
she did not believe that I was a real police officer. I told Mrs 
Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet.’

When asked by George Stephanopoulos if she learned any lessons from the incident, she joked and said: 'When a police officer tells you to stay 
in the car, you stay in the car.

'I think I've played a lawyer so many times in 
movies I think I am a lawyer sometimes. Clearly I am not.'
