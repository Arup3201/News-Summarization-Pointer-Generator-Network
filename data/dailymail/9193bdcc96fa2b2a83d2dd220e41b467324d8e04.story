A startling video has captured the moment competitive parents broke into a stampede as they rushed to register their child at a sought-after South Carolina elementary school on Monday.   

One mother was injured in the scrum of parents who had been lining up to enroll their son or daughter in classes at AJ Whittenberg - the only school in the district to offer engineering.

Competition for the Greenville school has grown more intense each year, with moms and dads even camping out this time around to ensure their kid gets a place.

Stampede: A startling video has captured the moment competitive parents broke into a stampede as they rushed to register their child at AJ Whittenberg in Greenville

'To me, as a father, I want (my) kids to have a better opportunity than I ever had,' Ruben Ruiz told ABC News.

The footage shows scores of parents breaking into a run and then fighting as they approach the registration area.

The stampede sent one mother falling to the ground and she was taken to hospital, according to the TV station. Her injury, however, wasn't serious and her child did get a spot at the school.

The school district has required parents to register their child on a first come, first serve basis for decades.

But due to the chaos at AJ 
Whittenberg, administrators are being forced to rethink the system at 
the Greenville County School District's 35 choice schools.

'While we appreciate the enthusiasm 
shown for many of our choice programs, we cannot have a process that 
subjects parents to potential risk of injury,' Superintendent Burke 
Royster told WSPA.com.

'We have already begun our review of 
the process by discussing suggested changes for next year with parents 
on site at the school. 

'The process will be modified in the future 
based on those discussions and review of the process at other schools.

Camping: Parents had been camping out at the school over the weekend to secure a place

It is planning a focus group of parents from across the area to discuss introducing a lottery system.

'There's no perfect system,' district spokesman Oby Lyles added.

'It doesn't matter whether it's first 
come, first serve, or lottery when you have 'x' number of spaces, 
somebody's probably not going to get in.'

Parents weren't allowed to start 
lining up until after school on Friday in an effort to keep the 
pandemonium to a minimum, the school district said.

It added that parents at dozens of other schools were well behaved.
