Defiant: Boris Johnson continued to back his 'fantasy' scheme and attacked the civil servants who dismissed it from an official shortlist

Boris Johnson caused dismay in Tory ranks yesterday by pressing on with his island airport plan.

Vowing to fight any expansion of Heathrow, the mayor of London said his Thames estuary vision was not dead despite it being ditched from an official shortlist.

Sir Howard Davies, the airports commissioner, said the £100billion scheme was not a credible option because of the cost and risks involved. Three options remain on the table – two rival plans for a third runway at Heathrow, and one for a second runway at Gatwick.

Mr Johnson said Sir Howard’s ‘myopic’ decision was ‘a giant smokescreen’ for a U-turn by civil servants who favour Heathrow expansion. And he demanded that David Cameron and George Osborne stick to a Conservative manifesto pledge to block a third runway in west London.

He said: ‘We shouldn’t be contracting out this decision to distinguished former civil servants, no matter how eminent they are. This is a political decision.

‘Gatwick is not a long-term solution,’ he said, adding that Heathrow would ‘create unbelievable levels of noise, blight and pollution’. The Prime Minister will be spared an immediate row because Sir Howard’s final recommendation will not be announced until just after the general election in May 2015.

It will now be at least 2025 before a third runway at Heathrow could be operational – allowing rival airports in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris to steal a march.

A further complication is that Mr Johnson, who is said to harbour prime ministerial ambitions, is seeking the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.

Opinion in the constituency, which borders Heathrow, is divided between those who depend on the airport for their livelihood and those worried about more noise.

Responding to the mayor’s attack, Sir Howard said: ‘I wish I had his speechwriter. I am not sure that this kind of colourful prose takes us very much further forward.

‘We are not persuaded that a very large airport in the Thames estuary is the right answer to London’s and the UK’s connectivity needs. The economic disruption would be huge and there are environmental hurdles which it may prove impossible or very time consuming to surmount.

‘Even the least ambitious version of the scheme would cost £70billion to £90billion with much greater public expenditure involved than in other options – probably some £30billion to £60billion in total.’

The remaining Heathrow and Gatwick options were shortlisted by his commission last December. But Sir Howard, who is the former head of the Financial Services Commission, had wanted more time to decide whether the estuary plan should join them.

Mary Creagh, Labour’s transport spokesman, said the decision ended the mayor’s ‘back-of-a-fag-packet’ scheme: ‘Boris Johnson’s fantasy island airport plan, which would have closed Heathrow and caused longer passenger journeys, has finally been dashed.’
