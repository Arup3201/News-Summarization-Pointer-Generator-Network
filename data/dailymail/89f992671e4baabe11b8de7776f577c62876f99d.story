A supermarket price war has eased the pressure on family finances, with food prices by their fastest rate for a decade.

As the big name chains including Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda slashed the price of bread and cereals, meat, vegetables and soft drinks, the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation fell to just 1.5 per cent, the lowest level since September 2009.

But with wages still rising by just 0.7 per cent, incomes are still being outstripped by rising living costs, as a poll shows voters are not feeling the benefit of the economic recovery.

The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation has fallen to 1.5 per cent, the lowest level since September 2009

Falling transport costs and price cuts on food and clothing were the biggest drivers of the fall in inflation

The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics mark the sixth month in a row when the inflation rate has been at or below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target. Inflation was last lower, at 1.1 per cent, in September 2009.

Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ‘Good news that inflation is at its lowest for 5 years - it means more stability and financial security for everyone.’

Continued low inflation could make an interest rate rise less likely, although Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned growth is much stronger and unemployment falling much more quickly than had been expected.

The battle between Britain’s leading supermarkets appears to be leading to real price cuts for shoppers.

Food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 0.6 per cent year on year, the sharpest fall since October 2004. Prices have been rising constantly since March 2006.

David Cameron hailed the fall 

Supermarket staples such as bread and cereals, meat, vegetables and soft drinks led the drop.

The big four supermarkets have been forced to offer bigger discounts I the face of the growing popularity of smaller rivals Aldi and Lidl.

Meanwhile, lower womenswear prices saw clothing and footwear record negative inflation for the first time since April last year.

Air fares, which were lower due to the timing of Easter, had a significant downward effect on inflation but motorists were hit by petrol price rises.

Catherine McKinnell,  Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister, said: 'The fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, yet most people are still feeling the squeeze.

'Wages after inflation have now fallen by over £1,600 a year under David Cameron and the link between the wealth of the nation and family finances is broken. A huge turnaround would be needed to ensure working people aren’t worse off than when this Tory-led government came to office.

'While the Tories try to deny it even exists, Labour has a clear plan to deal with the cost-of-living crisis and earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top.'
