Assaulted: Sarah Rix, 43, pictured, was lured to Milford Pre-School Plus in Hampshire, where she was beaten with a bottle by Melissa Morey. Morey was jailed for eight months for the attack

A pre-school worker tricked her supervisor into returning to the workplace out of hours, where she beat her over the head with a bottle before setting her car on fire.

Melissa Morey, 43, posed as a police officer, informing Sarah Rix that there had been a burglary at the school building.

But when the 43-year-old arrived at Milford Pre-School Plus in Hampshire, Morey was lying in wait to carry out the vicious assault.

Morey, dressed in a hooded top, pounced on her hapless colleague, smashing the bottle over her head and stamping on her while she lay on the ground.

The attack was so violent that investigators were able to tie Morey to the attack from boot marks left on her victim's back.

Morey, of Lyndhurst, Hants, was jailed for eight months after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm, theft of a motor vehicle and arson at Winchester Crown Court.

After the attack, Morey hijacked Miss Rix's Fiat Punto, abandoned it a short distance away and set fire to it.

Judge Susan Evans QC rejected a claim by the defence that Morey had been bullied by Miss Rix.

The court heard how the victim, a mother-of-one, now suffers sleepless nights and panic attacks after the attack by the woman she thought of as a friend.

She was sitting at her home in Lyndhurst home with her son, 14, when Morley called claiming to be a police officer.

Miss Rix said: 'She said she was calling
from New Milton police station, nearby, and that there had been a 
break-in at the pre-school.

'She asked if I could go in, as I'm the key holder for the school, to inspect some damage that had been done.'

She then drove to school and spotted a hooded figure in an alcove 
as she walked towards the entrance.

She was then struck on the head, inflicting a deep wound. Recalling the incident, Miss Rix said: 'I was hit again and she was pushing me down and I was screaming, 'Please leave me alone'.

'When I was on the floor she got her arm around my neck and I was in a hold and she said 'I have got a knife'. She kicked me on the back while I was on the floor really hard. She kicked and stamped on me about five times.

'The way she was going at me was so vicious that I thought I was going to die. I still can't believe it was her.'

Morey then drove her car to a church car park and torched it. Miss Rix, frantic with worry because her son was at home alone, immediately rang friends and the emergency services.

Meanwhile, Morey went home and retrieved her car, driving past the scene while her victim was still being
treated by paramedics.

Miss Rix says she is still 'mystified' by what prompted the attack, which left her hospitalised.

She said: 'The police officers who were dealing with it said it was the strangest case they had ever come across. I have never bullied anyone in my life - if I had, someone would have noticed as we are in a small pre-school.

'We've known each other for 10 years and I thought we were quite good friends.'

A charge alleging Morey impersonated a police officer was dropped.
