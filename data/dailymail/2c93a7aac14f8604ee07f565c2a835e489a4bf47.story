Its species may be among the most dangerous in the world, but it's difficult to feel afraid of this particular beast.

Stretching while sprawled out across the ice in Hudson Bay, Canada, this polar bear looks more like a teddy bear.

These adorable photographs, showing the bear in a number of positions while lying on its back, were taken by Dennis Minty.

The bear, part of one of the most dangerous species in the world, was pictured by Canadian photographer Dennis Minty, 67, while he was working as a guide in the area

The 67-year-old Canadian photographer caught the images while he was working as a polar bear guide in the area.

He explained that this is the area the bears gather in through October and November, 'in anticipation of the freeze-up of the bay'.

‘The bears are quite accustomed to seeing people in this area, and so act very naturally and are unafraid, allowing for close encounters like this,' said Mr Minty, of Newfoundland and Labrador.

‘I am always in awe when I get close to a bear.

'I feel incredibly privileged to see them in the wild like this.’

The photographer remained a reasonably safe distance from the bear - 40ft away in his 4x4 - to take the magnificent pictures of the bear as it stretched out on the ice

To take the photographs, Mr Minty sat in relative safety – 40ft away from the bear in his 4x4.

Polar bears are the world's largest subspecies of bear, with males generally weighing up to 600 kg.

They are also the most carnivorous member of the bear family, and throughout most of its range, its diet primarily consists of ringed and bearded seals.

Polar bear expert Mr Minty said that they need to eat around 2kg of fat a day, or 18,000 calories - 'equivalent to 54 cheeseburgers'.

‘When people see these polar bear photographs they usually have a chuckle and can identify with the feeling the bears are experiencing, of wanting some food,' Mr Minty said.

He added: ‘The subscript behind almost all of my images is that we are one with nature.

‘When we hurt the planet, as we are certainly doing now with global warming, we are damaging our own home.'
