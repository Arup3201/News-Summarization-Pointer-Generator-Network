A popular police officer hailed as 'the face of the NYPD' has been found dead at her home in an apparent suicide.

Stephanie Moses, 40, a police veteran of 17 years, is believed to have suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at the home she shared with her girlfriend in Baldwin, Long Island.

It is thought that she killed herself in the bedroom of her two-storey home after a fight with her lesbian lover Melissa McCoy, a retired NYPD detective.

Moses had served in the NYPD's ceremonial unit and became a well-known face through her duties, most famously when photographed with President Obama at the 9/11 memorial in New York City last year.

Moses was greeted warmly by President Obama at a wreath-laying ceremony at Ground Zero in May 2011. Obama and Moses then bowed their heads together in a solemn dedication to victims of the 9/11 attacks.

At the time, Obama said: 'When we say we will never forget, we mean what we say.' The ceremony was held just after the death of Osama Bin Laden to commemorate those who died at the World Trade Center in 2001.

Numerous tributes to Stephanie Moses have flooded in following the first reports of the sergeant's death.

NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said: 'On behalf of the New York City Police Department, I extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Sgt. Stephanie Moses who was, on so many occasions, the face of the NYPD on the national stage as well as routinely at police ceremonies.'

Kelly added: 'She epitomized professionalism in her appearance, conduct and dedication to duty.

'The department has suffered a great loss today that is felt personally by the many who knew and respected Sgt Moses.'

Ed Mullins, head of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said that the sad incident was 'just baffling.'

'This is a tragic loss,' Mullins said. 'She was just a great person. Always laughing, always chipper.'

He added: 'She was a person who was on the right track. That’s why it’s so shocking.'

Ms Moses is the daughter of a retired NYPD detective and grew up in Jamaica, according to the New York Post.

She graduated from the CUNY-NYPD Cadet Corps and earned a degree at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
