Australian Federal Police officers are being deployed to the MH17 crash site in Ukraine as part of a Dutch-led humanitarian mission after Russian separatists agreed to allow access.

So far there are 170 AFP officers in Ukraine with more on the way to join the 11 currently at the crash site.

The officers, who will be unarmed, will search for unrecovered bodies and remains and conduct a forensic examination of the crash site.

'Our objective is to get in, get cracking and to get out,' Mr Abbott said in Canberra on Sunday.

The 11 officers already at the site have largely been involved in observing and taking photographs. The latest deployment will involve recovering human remains and having them repatriated.

The mission is to stay as long as possible to do a professional job but it should take no longer than two to three weeks, Mr Abbott said.

'We don't want to be there any longer than is absolutely necessary,' he said.

The prime minister stressed the mission had 'absolutely nothing' to do with the politics of eastern Europe.

'Others can get involved if they wish ... our whole and sole purpose is to claim our dead and bring them home,' he said.

There had been a 'full and frank' discussion with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Donetsk on Saturday about allowing the team to conduct its work, Mr Abbott said.

While 'local people' had guaranteed the team's security, it did not mean they were safe under all circumstances.

'Frankly, we need to be prepared to take some risks in order to do the right thing by our dead and by their grieving families,' Mr Abbott said.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, speaking from Amsterdam, stressed the mission would be a non-threatening operation.

'All we want to do is secure the site so that we can inspect it thoroughly and bring back any remains,' she said.

Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17. The crash killed 298 people including 38 Australian citizens and residents.

The MH17 tragedy robbed Victorian siblings Milly and Sam Davison of parents but the pair are drawing on happy memories to cope with their grief.

A tribute for much-loved couple Liam and Frankie Davison took place on Sunday afternoon before a huge crowd of mourners at Toorak College in the state's southeast, overlooking Port Phillip Bay - southern Victoria.

'I smile with the knowledge they were loved, and they loved,' Milly Davison said of her parents through tears at the service, which attracted almost 1000 people.

'Mum and Dad will be together for the rest of time.'

The family spent their last day together having a picnic in the forest, Sam Davison told the gathered crowd.

Flight MH17 is believed to have been shot out of the sky above eastern Ukraine on July 17 as it was heading from the Netherlands to Malaysia.

Ms Davison, 54, had taught at Toorak College for 28 years and was highly regarded.

Mr Davison, 57, was an award-winning novelist, keen cyclist and an 'instrumental' educator at the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

They met after teenage surfer Mr Davison set eyes on Ms Davison while on a camping trip with mates.

The couple shared a passion for travelling, literature and the beach and 'loved each other to the moon and back', Ms Davison's sister Fiona Allamby said on Sunday.
