Fans and critics alike of Justin Bieber took to Twitter to either mock or defend their idol when he was arrested in Miami, Florida, for driving under the influence and drag-racing on Thursday morning.

While Bieber's fans, known as 'Beliebers', took to social media to stand up for the pop star, others were quick to capitalise on the 19-year-old's downfall, usually armed with the aid of Photoshop.

Multiple users in particular pointed out Bieber's striking similarity to another teen idol who collects a lot of negative publicity - Miley Cyrus.

Twitter user @Marissa_Pearson summed up a common sentiment online, saying: 'Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber were actually separated at birth uno'.

For others, the joke has already worn thin however.

@RonnnBurg wrote: 'If I see that half Justin Bieber, half Miley Cyrus picture or anything about Justin going to jail I'm going to go insane then unfollow.'

Some Twitter users were keen to play up the fact that Bieber was reportedly stopped by police while doing 60mph in a 30mph zone, playing on the fact he was involved in a high-speed police chase.

Others went further, playing on the news that the teenager was stopped while allegedly taking part in a drag race with his friend, aspiring rap star Khalil Sharief.

When Bieber's police mugshot first surfaced on Thursday, the star appeared relatively happy and fresh-faced, despite joining the ranks of many celebrities who have worn an orange jumpsuit over the years. For some, the opportunity to superimpose Bieber into shots for the popular Netflix show 'Orange is the new Black' proved too much.

Likewise, he was lampooned by others for sporting the orange gear, perhaps inspiring a new fashion craze for 2014.

Bieber is of course not the first celebrity to appear in a police mugshot. He joins such illustrious ranks as Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and Macaulay Culkin. Some suggested he could maybe turn to them for words of wisdom - that is, if they want to speak to him.

Even the Dallas Stars ice hockey team's mocking of Bieber made it on to Twitter. Bieber, an ardent fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs, made an appearance on the arena jumbotron.

Other tweets were not so light-hearted. Perhaps the most surprising tweet of all came from actor Seth Rogen, who posted: 'All jokes aside, Justin Bieber is a piece of s***.' The comment has been retweeted more than 127,000 times at the time of writing.

The comment was all the more surprising given that the pair hung out together quite happily at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.

Speaking out: On Thursday, Seth Rogan tweeted his disdain for the superstar

Many of Bieber's other followers were more supportive about the singer's downfall.

@Clarkeischilled wrote: 'Well the media pushed for his downfall and got their golden ticket, the support will always be there no matter how many headlines you get.'

@thejbiebervogue added: 'So my mom came into my room and said "So did you hear about Justin?" And I just hid under my covers and said "I don't wanna talk about it"'

Another fan, @kidrauhlcharts posted: 'I am helpless. I
 can't do anything to help Justin. What if one day we wake up and 
Justin's gone. I don't even want to think about it.'[sic]

And @SelenaGomezFans wrote: 'why can't you give a hand to Justin Bieber instead of criticizing him? he is a human and has problems like you like me, dear society' [sic]

Some fans are reportedly skipping their mid-term exams, according to a post from The Wire which was published on Thursday morning.

'Justin Bieber is not worth going to remedial algebra for,' The Wire said.

Trending: Twitter has been inundated with posts about Bieber

Yet many other haters took Seth Rogan's lead and wrote of their disdain for the international star.

@_julery followed suit and tweeted: 'Justin Bieber is disgusting. Why is the media giving him so much attention for being the stupid human being we've known he is for years?'

And @brookeeetaylor added: 'Justin Bieber is literally the worst human being on this planet.' [sic]

Supportive: Twitter fan reaction

The Boyfriend hitmaker was stopped in a rented yellow Lamborghini after he and his friends were caught drag racing in a residential area of Miami Beach shortly after 4:00 a.m.

MailOnline has learned his father Jeremy was on the scene as well.

Hours after the arrest, Police Chief 
Raymond Martinez confirmed in a press conference that Justin will face 
charges of DUI, driving with an expired driver's license out of the 
state of Georgia and resisting arrest without violence.

Negative: Not everyone was in support of the singer
