The man who successfully piloted suborbital SpaceShipOne - the first manned private spaceflight - has paid tribute to killed Virgin Galactic pilot Michael Alsbury.

Commercial astronaut Brian Binnie described Alsbury as a ‘dedicated’ pilot pursuing his dream of flying into space.

Alsbury, a father of two and pilot with Scaled Composites, was killed on Friday when SpaceShipTwo exploded just minutes after it detached from its mother ship, WhiteKnightTwo.

The 39-year-old had flown missions on SpaceShipTwo for years, including the all-important first successful rocket-powered run in April 2013.

He was also the pilot in the first glide flight back in 2010, and flew as recently as August 28 this year.

Binnie, 61, who worked alongside Alsbury for several years at Scaled Composites, the firm which operates SpaceShipTwo, told MailOnline: ‘Mike was a very dedicated pilot who had the energy and knowledge to fly into space.

‘He had the desire to get to where he wanted to be and that was to fly the mother ship when it was built and then get in to the space ship.

‘It was his dream, he was fighting for that position the whole time.’

Binnie, who piloted the SpaceShipOne on a $10million prize-winning flight nearly a decade ago, breaking a number of flight records, is proud to have worked with Alsbury.

He said: 'Michael in my mind is what I call a Renaissance engineer.'

‘He just beat me to working at Scaled, we arrived at similar times, he was put on a program to manage a pretty complex project at the time called Proteus, which was a twin engine, high altitude jet that could carry different kinds of payloads.

‘He knew that vehicle inside and out, backwards and forwards. Mike was one of these guys, you could pull out a complicated schematic and it might look like Greek to you, there are diodes and valves and dash lines and dotted lines, but he was very comfortable in that world.

‘That airplane is still the workhorse at Scaled Composites today, I’ve flown it all over the country.

‘And all credit for the functionality of that aircraft goes to Mike Alsbury.

‘He devoted his time and effort to making sure it was the safest and best flying vehicle that we had and he delivered that in spades.’

When Scaled Composites began developing SpaceShipOne, Binnie was the test pilot while Alsbury operated Mission Control back down on earth.

Binnie said: ‘I called him mini Mike because there was another, older Mike on the team.

‘He was thorough, capable, dedicated and very much wanted to be a part of the pilot community.

‘He was working hard in the background so he could put himself in a position to be considered for SpaceShipTwo - and he achieved his dream.’

Wreckage: SpaceShipTwo plummeted to earth in several pieces. The wreckage was scattered across the Mojave Desert

Binnie also paid tribute to Alsbury’s good nature saying he was a pleasure to work beside.

‘In this world, pilots being pilots, they are driven, they are A-type personalities, but I’ve never witnessed Mike lose his cool or his temper which is easy to do when you’ve got schedule pressures and competing designs.

‘Mike seemed to be able to rise above all that, which was pretty remarkable.’

Binnie has had a remarkable career.

On December 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first powered flight, U.S. Navy officer Binnie piloted the first powered test flight of SpaceShipOne, which reached a top speed of Mach 1.2 and a height of 12.9 miles.

On October 4, 2004, he piloted SpaceShipOne's second Ansari X Prize flight, winning the X Prize and becoming the 435th person to go into space.

His flight, which peaked at 367,442ft, set a winged aircraft altitude record.

It also earned him the second set of Astronaut Wings to be given by the FAA for a flight aboard a privately operated commercial spacecraft.
