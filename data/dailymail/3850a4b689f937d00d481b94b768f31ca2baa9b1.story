Millions of couples have delayed starting a family over financial concerns according to new research 

Millions of people are delaying having children until they have paid off their debts, new research shows.

A study found that deciding when to start a family had become a matter head over heart as cash-strapped couples get their finances in order first.

Research showed one in seven UK adults – the equivalent of seven million people – are considering starting a family or having another child.

But up to a third of these will have to pay off debts first, while a fifth are saving for a bigger house before doing so.

The Debt Advisory Centre said two-thirds of respondents admitted personal finances played a part in deciding when to have children, while a fifth felt this was central to their decision.

Ian Williams, of the DAC, said: ‘Sadly, for millions of people, deciding when to have children has become a financial decision.

‘Do they have space? Can they afford to a bigger place? Will they be able to afford their existing commitments if they lose an income or pay for childcare?

‘Paying off debts is sensible, although it’s surprising to see that so many people are having to take this step.’

The survey questioned 2,000 adults, of which 270 expressed a desire to have children in the future.

A separate study released yesterday showed that by talking about financial worries remained a ‘taboo’ subject among reserved Britons.

Legal & General launched a campaign called the ‘Great British Money Taboo’ to encourage people to discuss money and plan for their financial future.

Research found two fifths of the population said their money was one of the biggest stresses in their lives, but half it was a personal matter and should not be talked about.

Financial worries placed the greatest pressure on family life, the study found, but also affected people’s moods and their ability to sleep at night.
