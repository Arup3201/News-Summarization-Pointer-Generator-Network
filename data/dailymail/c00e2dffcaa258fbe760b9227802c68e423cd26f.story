Conman: Basharat Bashir was jailed for three years for stealing £19,000 from pensioners under the guise of selling mobility equipment

A conman tricked several elderly victims out of £19,000 under the guise of selling stairlifts and other mobility equipment.

Businessman Basharat Bashir, 33, admitted stealing the money from 11 vulnerable pensioners and spending the money on Sky TV, phones and flashy cars.

Birmingham Crown Court heard Bashir, from Sheldon, West Midlands, ripped off the OAPs who paid him for mobility items which never arrived. 

Bashir was jailed for three years after he admitted 19 charges, including 17 fraud offences and also pleaded guilty to fraudulent trading and money laundering.

Sentencing Judge William Davis QC said: ‘You have defrauded a significant number of very vulnerable and very elderly people.

‘It was money they simply couldn’t afford to lose, money doubtless saved over long working hours, hoping to use it to make things easier for them in their declining years.’

The case was brought against Bashir following an investigation by Birmingham City Council’s Trading Standards team. 

They found that a total 11 pensioners were scammed by Bashir through his company Mobility World (UK) Ltd over a year long period from December 2009.

The fraudster pocketed the cash and spent it on his TV needs as well as buying mobile phones and renting luxury cars.

Defending Theresa Hunt said Bashir was full of remorse for his actions and wanted to repay his victims, despite having just £20 in the bank.

She said: ‘He became a dishonest businessman when cash-flow became so acutely disastrous.

‘He wishes to repay every penny back to his victims. He feels extremely remorseful.’

After the hearing he was branded a ‘scumbag’ by a relative of one of his victims.

Joseph Gripton, 87, from Tipton, West Midlands, who died two years before seeing Bashir sentenced, lost almost £10,000 to the fraudster.

Today his niece, Jackie Jones, said: ‘My uncle was a proper gentleman who trusted everybody. 

‘He was so honest and thought everybody was too but they’re not. There are some scumbags about.’

On one occasion Bashir even drove the retired electrical engineer to a cashpoint so he could withdraw money for a mattress which never arrived.

After the case Lord Harris, chairman of the National Trading Standards Board, said: ‘Criminals who deceive consumers by tricking them into paying for products or services they have no intention of delivering cause enormous harm to those on low incomes.

‘In the worst cases, they may destroy the lives of individuals and families.

‘Trading standards are working hard to tackle these despicable criminals.’

Bashir was also banned from holding a company directorship for seven years.

In a separate incident earlier this month, conman Andrew Ross, 27, was jailed after he stole thousands of pounds from Justin Bieber fans after falsely promising them the chance to meet their hero.

Ross, 27, advertised VIP tickets online to Bieber’s sell-out shows at London’s O2 Arena in March. He was jailed for 12 months after admitting five charges of fraud totalling £6,458 at Hamilton Sheriff Court.
