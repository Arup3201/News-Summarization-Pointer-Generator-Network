Naked pictures of Seth Rollins, a top star in the WWE, as well as an up-and-coming female wrestler and model have appeared on social media accounts in an apparent hack and subsequent revenge post.

World Wrestling Entertainment's Seth Rollins apologized to family and friends after naked selfies of Zahra Schreiber, a 'Diva', simultaneously appeared on his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts.

But shortly after the images appeared on the social networking sites Leighla Schultz, Rollins' fiancee, uploaded naked pictures of the wrestler in an apparent act of revenge. 

Wrestler Seth Rollins has issued a public apology after a naked image of a female wrestler and model appeared on his social media accounts, provoking his fiancee to post naked images of Rollins on Twitter

These were picked up by several Twitter users who commented on the slew of naked pictures.  

All the pictures have now been removed and Rollins posted an apology to his followers. 

He said: 'I would like to apologize to all the WWE fans and my family and friends for private photographs that were distributed without my consent.'

However Rollins offered no explanation for how the images came to be posted on his account and did not respond to comments that his account had been hacked. 

When a fan suggested Schultz could also have been hacked because she never used Twitter, she responded: 'I definitely did Hahahaha.'

The images of Schreiber, a model and wrestler for NXT - the developmental branch of WWE - appeared on the social media accounts on Monday. They were also uploaded to the official WWE page which links to Rollins' social media accounts. 

Rollins offered no explanation as to how this picture of Zahra Schreiber appeared on his Instagram account

The wrestler's fiancee appeared to retaliate to the pictures by posting these naked photos of Rollins online

Despite the apology Rollins has yet to explain how he came to have the pictures. 

They were posted with the misspelt name Zahara and an emoji with hearts for eyes. 

The images attracted the attention of Schultz who then appeared to retaliate with her own posts featuring Rollins and the misspelled name 'Zaharah?' 

Schultz also wrote several messages on a friend's Facebook page mocking Rollins for an apparent affair.

Joking about messages that may have been exchanged between Rollins and Schreiber, she said: 'i hate my life and my fiancée i just wanted to run away with you[sic].'

Rollins published the public apology on his Twitter account after the explicit images emerged on Monday 

Schreiber worked as a model and has recently been signed to the development arm of WWE
