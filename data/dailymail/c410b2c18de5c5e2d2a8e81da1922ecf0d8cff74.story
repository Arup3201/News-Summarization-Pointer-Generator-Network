The country’s cheapest Christmas trees were being snapped up for just £1 each yesterday at a branch of Ikea.

Bargain hunters rushed to the store in Southampton after the original price was slashed by 96 per cent.

And unlike most of the Swedish-owned company’s products there wasn’t even any tricky assembling to do at home – the Nordmann Firs, which are popular because their needles don’t drop, are real.

Home products giant IKEA have slashed the price of their Christmas trees to just £1

The store in Southampton, Hampshire, ordered thousands of real Nordmann Fir Christmas trees but had to drop the price from £25

Ikea, famous for its flat-pack 
furniture, has previously sold artificial Christmas trees but this is 
the first year it has offered real ones.

They were something of a bargain even at the original price of £25, because a 6ft Nordmann Fir usually costs around £50.

But Ikea stores across the country had to discount their prices heavily when they failed to sell at the start of the month.

The Southampton branch had ordered thousands of trees and initially reduced them to £5 before cutting the price again to £1.

Retired teacher Jenny Harding, 68, of Hythe, Hampshire, said: ‘My son bought his tree from a local garden centre and it cost him £60. I can’t believe that these trees are going for just one pound. It’s the same tree and same quality.’

Theresa Bickle, 43, of Hedge End, said: ‘I had no intention of coming home with a tree, but when I saw the huge amount they had and that they were on offer for one pound I couldn’t resist.’

A staff member at Southampton 
confided yesterday that they still had just under 1,300 trees left and 
were expecting a ‘late rush’ when word of the bargain spread.

He added: ‘We’ve had the trees in for two weeks and struggled to shift them. 

‘Now they are just one pound they are flying off the shelves.’

Ikea
stores across the country are selling the trees at varying discounted 
prices. Staff in Leeds were effectively paying people to take the trees 
by offering a £20 Ikea voucher for every £10 tree bought.

A survey last month revealed that fewer than one in five homes will have a real Christmas tree this year.

People
told the consumer group Which? that the cost compared to an artificial 
version put them off at a time when most were tightening their financial
belts.'

It is a staggering 96 per cent discount

Shoppers are said to be stunned by the bargain. It is the first time the store has sold the trees
