They were cleared of accusations they enslaved and abused their nanny.

But now this wealthy New York City couple have been barred from the country - after a border official cited the case as evidence of human trafficking.

Malu Custer Edwards and Micky Hurley, both descended from Chilean aristocracy, spent a year in and out of court denying Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garnica's allegations that she was locked up and abused in the  Upper East Side apartment.

Their 50-year-old aide testified that she was brought to the US from Chile using a fake passport and forced to work 12 hours a day for just $2 an hour for three months looking after their three children.

However, a judge dismissed the case on December 10, claiming Villanueva contradicted her own testimony.

Despite the ruling, 30-year-old Ms Edwards, 37-year-old Mr Hurley, and their young children - aged three, five and seven - remain in exile in the northern town of Portofino, which brands itself as the eighth wonder of the world.

Ms Edwards, whose ancestor Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure led the League Of Nations in 1922, said in an interview with the New York Times that friends remark: ''Well, what's so bad about Italy?'' 

Her response: 'Well, just wait until you are anywhere in the world, and you think you'll be there a couple of weeks, and then be told you can't go back to where your life is.'

She and Mr Hurley, who descends from Chile's founding fathers, are now looking for a new rental apartment and appealing to the consul general in Italy.

Meanwhile, she says, they are struggling to ignore a tumultuous influx of hate mail.

'We have received hate mail and even death threats from the lies that were said about our children and ourselves,' she told the New York Post. 'We just want to return to our current lives in New York.'

 'Abuse': Ms Edwards claims the pair have been receiving hate mail in the wake of the dismissed lawsuit

The lawsuit against the family was thrown out this month after a judge said Garnica contradicted herself.

According to the New York Post, court documents show Judge Alvin Hellerstein found Garnica 'testified that she did not believe her own allegation, that the mother, Malu Custer Edwards, purposefully allowed the children to hit her,' and that she 'testified she was never locked in any room.'

Despite the denials from Edwards and Hurley, the New York Department of Labor ordered the couple to pay Villanueva $6,302 in back wages in 2011. 

Garnica had claimed to the New York Post that the couple often left her with only small slices of bread and milk to eat, while they were regulars at the exclusive French restaurant Balthazar - where entrees run $30 to $45.  

'The claims are completely without merit and will be fully refuted in court,' attorney Robin Alperstein told the Post.

Garnica said she began working for Edwards and Hurley in Chile in December 2010 but the coupledecided to move to New York in January 2011 so Edwards could enroll the the New School. 

She claimed the couple did not deliver on their promise of $10-an-hour and health care.

Finally, in March 2011, she quit her job claiming one of the children slammed her head in a door.
