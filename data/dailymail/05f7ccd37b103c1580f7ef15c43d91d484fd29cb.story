Missed: John McCormick, a Vietnam veteran, passed away last week after mowing the grass

The family of a man who died of a heart attack after mowing the lawn has thanked the firefighters who returned to their home to finish the job.

John McCormick, 67, who had a history of heart problems, passed away two days after suffering a heart attack while cutting the grass in front of his home in Bayton, Texas last Tuesday.

When his grieving family returned home, they found a note from the firefighters of Engine 4.

'We felt bad that your husband didn't get to finish the yard,' the firefighters said in their note, which said they had put the lawnmower away in an unlocked garage.

'We are very sorry that your husband became ill, we hope he has a speedy recovery. Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you out.'

The firefighters had followed the ambulance to hospital and as they headed back to their station, the idea struck engine driver, Luke Bednarek, to return to the home and finish the lawn.

On their way, the men argued over who would cut the grass and firefighter Blake Steffenauer took on the job after being the first to jump out, KHOU11 reported.

Act of kindness: After following his ambulance to the hospital, firefighters returned to the home, where they finished the job for the family. They were photographed by neighbors who spotted the good deed

Thoughtful: The men left this note behind, telling the family to let them know if they needed further help

A neighbor spotted the kind act and 
snapped photographs of Steffenauer pushing the mower. The photos were 
shared online, where they quickly spread.

After some 
of the other firefighters took a turn to mow the grass - even finishing 
the backyard as well - they locked the mower away in the garage and 
dropped the key in the mailbox.

Lieutenant J.D. Giles left the note and, speaking to KHOU11, insisted they'd done nothing extraordinary.

'Not at all,' he said. 'Just something to help someone out in the worst time of their life.'

Steffenauer
 added: 'They already got stuff they've got going on that's more 
important. Yard work shouldn't be something they'd have to finish up. So
 we were happy to come back and take care of that.'

All in a day's work: Lieutenant JD Giles, left, said the mowing carried out by his men, including Blake Steffenauer, right, was the least they could do when the family were facing such terrible news

The family expressed their surprise and their thanks to the crew.

'It just showed me that there's still compassion,' McCormick's daughter, Jeana Blackford, told KHOU. 'That people still do random acts of kindness every day for people that they don't know.'

His wife Patsy added: 'I just couldn't believe they took the time to do that... Thank you. We love you.'

Other members of the Bayton community praised the firefighters.

'All
 of our City employees are proud to serve the citizens of Baytown, but 
this is truly special,' the city said in a statement posted on Facebook.

'We couldn't be prouder of our guys from Station 4. Our prayers are with the family at this sad time.'

Loved: McCormick's wife Patsy (pictured with her husband and one of their granddaughters) said she could not believe the kind gesture and expressed her thanks to the firefighters

John McCormick, an Air Force Vietnam veteran, will be buried with full military honors at Houston National Cemetery on Wednesday.

His obituary paid tribute to the loving, very particular grandfather.

'He never met a stranger, never left the house without first getting dressed up,' it read. '[He] enjoyed eating ice cream, drinking coffee, and watching his granddaughter's activities.'
