Stoke boss Mark Hughes admits he tried to sign Emmanuel Riviere during the summer - and says the goal-shy Newcastle striker will be a hit in the Premier League.

The Monaco frontman joined the Magpies in a £6million deal and has started every game for his new club, although he is yet to open his account in the league.

Riviere did, however, score twice during last week’s 3-2 win at Crystal Palace in the Capital One Cup and that has persuaded manager Alan Pardew to keep faith with the 24-year-old for Monday’s trip to the Britannia Stadium.

Mark Hughes revealed Stoke tried to sign Newcastle forward Emmanuel Riviere during the summer 

Hughes said that although they showed interest in Riviere the feeling didn't appear to be reciprocated 

And Hughes revealed: ‘We had conversations with people close to him.

‘There was an indication he may be available this summer, so we pursued it to a certain extent. We were able to go and offer decent money but there has to be a feeling the enthusiasm we have for a certain player is reciprocated. We didn’t get that from the player or his advisers.

‘There’s always a point during the window where you think you have to draw a line under that one. That was the case with him.’

He added: ‘I have a lot of respect for his ability. He will be a good player in the Premier League. But it is not easy coming to a new country.’

The nformer Monaco man scored his first goals for Newcastle in their 3-2 win over Crystal Palace last week

Apart from his brace in the Capital One Cup, the Frenchman has failed to score since his £6m summer move
