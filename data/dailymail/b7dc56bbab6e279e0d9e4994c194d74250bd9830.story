A new species of fish has been named after President Barack Obama by the researchers who discovered it.

The freshwater fish has distinctive bright orange and blue colours and is generally found in fast-flowing rivers around America.

It is one of five new species of darter - the smallest member of the perch family - to be discovered in recent months.

Fit to be called a President: This recently discovered species of darter has been named after Barack Obama

In good company: Barack Obama is one of four presidents to have newly discovered fish named after them

The remaining four species have been named after three other presidents and one vice-president.

The tiny fish - which are normally under
50mm in length - have been spotted by researchers from Geosyntec 
Consultants and Saint Louis University in waters in Arkansas, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Tennessee.

Geosyntec Consultants researcher Steve Layman told The Guardian:
'We chose President Obama for his environmental leadership, 
particularly in the areas of clean energy and environmental protection, 
and because he is one of our first leaders to approach conservation and 
environmental protection from a more global vision.'

Spot the difference: A darter fish that has been named after former American vice-president Al Gore

Wilderness saviour: Teddy Roosevelt was picked because of the American national parks he created

The other leaders were also picked for their environmental credentials.

Teddy Roosevelt was saving vast areas of wilderness by creating national parks. Jimmy Carter was picked for his humanitarian work in his post-presidential career.

Bill Clinton was honoured for his wilderness preservation and finally Al Gore, the sole vice-president on the list, for his environmental campaigning and raising raising awareness of global warming through projects such as his documentary An Inconvenient Truth.

Very similar: All the fish are a vibrant mix of bright blue and orange colours

Environmentalist: Bill Clinton is another President picked because of his 'green credentials'
