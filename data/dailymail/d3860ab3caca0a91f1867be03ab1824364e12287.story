On trial: Paramedic Christopher Bridger is accused of raping one woman and groping four others after gaining their trust by claiming he was gay

A paramedic told a female student he is alleged to have raped he 'didn't want to be gay' moments after he attacked her, a court today heard.

Christopher Bridger is accused of raping one student and fondling four others after gaining their trust by telling them he was homosexual.

It is alleged he carried out two of the attacks while he studied at St George's University Hospital in London and the other three were while he worked for South East Coast Ambulance Service.

Today in court, one woman told how the 25-year-old said he 'just wanted to fancy girls' after he had raped her in his student bedroom.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Bridger started crying after he had carried out the attack.

'I asked him why he was crying,' she said in her video interview played to the jury.

'He said he was sorry. He doesn't want to be gay.

'His family won't accept he's gay and he just wanted to fancy girls.'

Bridger, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, 
denies one count of rape, two of assault by penetration, three of sexual
 assault and one of causing a person to engage in a sexual activity 
without consent, between September 2009 and October 2012.

Earlier in court, Caroline Carberry, prosecuting, told the 
jury at Guildford Crown Court: 'Christopher Bridger is a sexual predator
 and confidence trickster who used the cover or ruse of pretending to be
 gay in order to befriend and become close to, and then take advantage 
of young female friends and colleagues when they were at their most 
vulnerable.'

The jury then heard how Bridger had attacked the woman after a fresher's week party when he accompanied her back to their halls of residence in September or October 2008 after she had got 'very drunk' and became upset.

The court heard he began by cuddling her in his bed, before he started kissing her despite her asking him to stop. He then allegedly raped her.

'Finally he did stop and she said that he started crying and she felt she had to comfort him even though she knew he was in the wrong,' Mrs Carberry said.

'He told her he said he wanted to like girls and was having problems with his family'.

The alleged victim told a friend who shouted at Bridger and the court heard that he later apologised to her.

Mrs Carberry said that in February or March 2009, the same woman who had shouted at Bridger had got drunk with friends in her kitchen and texted him saying he was missing a good night while at work.

Bridger allegedly arrived and attacked her as she was laid in bed, despite repeatedly telling him to stop.

The court heard the woman began having panic attacks and left the university hospital at the end of the year.

Three more women made allegations of sex attacks after he began working at the South East Coast Ambulance NHS Service.

One, a lesbian, accused him of attacking her in a hotel room after she had got drunk at a work Christmas party in December 2011.

Her partner told police that they had gone to their shared room after she got very drunk and had argued. Her partner began recording her on her phone to show her what she was like when drunk the next day.

The court heard Bridger turned up and insisted he stay to make sure the woman was alright.

'She went into the bathroom and the phone was still recording and it picks up what Bridger said to (the alleged victim),' said Mrs Carberry.

'She was so drunk or asleep that she is almost incapable of speech.

'The defendant can be heard moving her along the bed and telling her that he loves her more than she will ever know. When she slurs to him that she is asleep, he can be heard to kiss her.'

Allegations: Guildford Crown Court (pictured) heard that Bridger repeatedly attacked colleagues or students when they were extremely drunk and 'incapable of speech'

The court heard that he left to speak to the woman's partner, at which point the recording stopped, before going to bed in between the two of them.

The woman woke up to find Bridger abusing her and eventually she managed to wake her partner.

'She saw Bridger become agitated and he said they had kissed and touched each other,' said Mrs Carberry.

The next day he was said to have sent messages apologising to his alleged victim.

A hospital receptionist who had known Bridger claimed he attacked her in June 2012 after a night out when she went back to his home for a few drinks. She fell asleep in bed with him but awoke to find him trying to kiss her and later taking her trousers off.

His final alleged victim said he groped her after she allowed him to stay the night at her house after a dinner in September or October 2012.

The court heard all the women had been told by Bridger - and believed him - that he was openly gay.

After the incidents were reported to the South East Coast Ambulance Service, Bridger was suspended, pending an internal investigation.

Despite being told not to contact any of the alleged victims, he left a voicemail message with the final complainant on Christmas morning 2012.

She handed the message to her supervisor. Mrs Carberry said: 'In that recording, his tone was threatening and he was full of self-pity, completely different to his tone when he was later arrested by police.'

Surrey Police arrested Bridger in January 2013 and he denied any involvement, telling police he was a gay man who had had several same sex relationships.

He had been separately arrested by the Metropolitan Police and questioned in relation to the allegations while he was a student.

He claimed he had fallen asleep with an arm on the lesbian complainant in the same bed as her partner, awoken and went to his room. The court heard he could provide no explanation for what he apologised to the woman for or the phone recording.

Bridger claimed to have had consensual sex with the first student and penultimate colleague alleged victim, while also claiming to have fallen asleep with an arm on the last alleged victim chronologically.

He said the second alleged student victim had tried to come onto him while drunk but he had 'been her knight in shining armour' and looked after her.

The trial, before Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith, is expected to last two weeks.
