Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley, the top officer in the Tameside Division for Greater Manchester Police, said: “The numbers of people that are here today not only symbolises the popularity of what Nicola and Fiona stood for.

“But it is also a symbol of hope that actually, within the community, we want to rid these communities of individuals that cause fear, cause misery.

“Together, as a consequence of Nicola and Fiona’s deaths, we are determined ever more to do that.”

Community volunteer Elsie Dixon paid tribute to the two officers and said their deaths would not be in vain.

She said Hattersley was a “community in mourning” adding: “Those two girls are precious.

“We are a community that care, not just for ourselves but for each other and for the people that serve our community.

“Our police officers are part of our community and those girls were special.”

She said: “Yes, we are hurting. But the families, friends and colleagues of those two young lasses are hurting a damn sight more.”

Struggling to compose herself Mrs Dixon added: “Our hearts are overflowing with tears.

“As many rain drops as you see, as many petals as you see on the flowers. Those tears are within each of our hearts.”

As she finished her speech she was given a hug and kissed on the head by Mr Adderley who thanked her for her words.
