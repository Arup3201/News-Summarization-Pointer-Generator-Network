An autistic college student, 20, cried all day as he waited for a school bus that never came.

That's because he was suspended from his classes for 'sexual assault' on January 5 for hugging and kissing a stranger, says his troubled mother.

Brian Ferguson was in a special needs program at Navarro College in Waxahachie, Texas when he saw a woman in the hallway he thought he knew and went in to hug her and give her a friendly kiss, says mother Staci Martin.

'He gave her a hug and kissed her on the top of her head,' Martin said told NBC.

Cried all day: When Brian Ferguson heard he could not return to school he cried all day and sat waiting for a bus to take him to his beloved campus 

'He's 6'5", so when he gives hugs, he'll give you a big hug and kiss you right here on the top of your scalp,' she said as she described her son's innocent nature.

Martin claims that the college banned her son from classes and called his actions 'sexual assault' despite it being what she says is an honest mistake.

'And then they labelled it "sexual assault" because of the kissing,' Martin said.

'They said a kiss is considered an assault.'

Martin said her son was utterly devastated upon learning he could not go back to school and cried all day long as he waited for a phantom bus to arrive.

'He cried the whole next day,' she said.

'He got up for school, waited for the bus. I told him it wasn't coming.'

Navarro College has refused to elaborate on why it issued the punishment.

Heartbroken: Staci Martin said her son greets people by giving them a hug and a kiss on the head and says he meant absolutely no harm and is bored staying at home 

A one-sentence statement from the school said that 'any decisions about students' enrollment in the special-needs program are made by the individual school district,' reports NBC.

Martin claims that a college dean told her that her son is 'no longer welcome back.'

Ferguson's sister Justine Colquitt, also a student at the school, wrote about the suspension in a Facebook post that's since gone viral.

'To completely kick him out of school and alter his whole course of life, it's just completely ridiculous,' she wrote.

Administrators at Waxahachie High said on Friday that Ferguson could return to class at the high school, but not to the college.

Ferguson said he wants nothing more than to return to school. He has apologized for offending anyone.

'I want to go back to school,' Ferguson said when prompted by his mother.

'I'm bored staying at home.'

When CBS contacted the college they were informed that the student was actually 'welcome back at the college' - something that came as a surprise to Martin.

The school told CBS that they are meeting with the young woman he kissed and the mother tomorrow to discuss the future and that ‘there are no hard feelings.’

Hope to return: Officials at Navarro college originally said that Ferguson could no longer return but they now say they are working to amend the situation
