With battery life consistently voted as the most important feature when upgrading a phone, handsets, chip makers and networks are working on ways to squeeze as much energy out of them as possible.

And now Nokia Networks believes it has made a significant breakthrough – boosting battery life by up to 49 per cent.

The Finnish-based firm saw the results during its first live trial of a software known as High Speed Cell FACH on a 3G network. 

Nokia Networks has completed its first live testing of High Speed Cell FACH technology. When using apps, phones send and receive small amounts of data, and Nokia's technology is designed to handle these so-called 'data packets' more efficiently. This increases browsing speeds, power savings and response times

When running applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as browsing the web, sending emails and using services such as FaceTime, phones often send and receive small amounts of data, known as packets, of just a few hundreds of bytes or a few kbytes.

High Speed Cell FACH is designed to handle these small data packets more efficiently than other software.

The software is designed to help operators handle data sent over 3G networks.

These are known as packets, and are typically just a few hundreds of bytes or a few kbytes.

High Speed Cell FACH is designed to handle these small data packets more efficiently than other software.

This makes apps run faster, and also means they use less energy over the course of a day, for example.

The technology also means operators can boost the speed and quality of their services, and support a higher number of phones on their networks.

More technical details can be found on Nokia's original white paper.

The technology additionally means operators can boost the speed and quality of their services, and support a higher number of phones on their networks.

According to the recent Nokia tests, the 3G software boosts speeds and network response times by up to 65 per cent, and leads to up to 20 per cent faster browsing.

Users also saw power savings of up to 49 per cent, which meant their battery life lasted almost twice as long - depending on which applications were being used.

The lowest power saving was nine per cent.

The tests were run on the commercial 3G/HSPA network of a major European operator - although Nokia did not reveal which operator it was.

Testers also used devices fitted with Qualcomm Snapdragon processors that already support High Speed Cell FACH.

MailOnline has contacted both companies for more specific information. 

‘Smartphones already outsell feature phones and by 2018, smartphone penetration in some developed markets is expected to exceed 90 per cent,’ said Thorsten Robrecht, vice president, mobile broadband portfolio management at Nokia Networks.

The tests were run on a commercial 3G/HSPA network using devices fitted with Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. Results revealed 50% power savings, when certain apps were used, 65% faster response times, and 21% faster browsing. Ping relates to networks sending signals to a web-enabled device

‘With virtually all these smartphones being 3G-enabled, it's important to be able to improve network efficiency.’

High Speed Cell FACH is a capability that Qualcomm Technologies already supports on its latest Snapdragon processors.

These processors are seen in high-end, flagship phones including the Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy Note Edge and Note 4, and Amazon Fire HDX 8.9 (2014).

Nokia said the live network tests ‘produced substantial performance gains that exceeded Qualcomm's expectations’, including beating previous laboratory test results. 

But it is not known when it will be widely available to networks and customers.
