Busted: The suspect was identified as Paul Ali Slater - pictured in a previous mugshot - who has a long rap sheet and was recently released from prison

Dramatic 911 calls of the moments 
before and after a mother shot a home intruder while trying to protect 
her nine-year-old twins have been released.

Rather than call police when the man 
broke into her house, Melinda Herman took the twins - and her husband's 
handgun - to the attic and called her husband, who then called police on
her behalf.

In the phone call, Donnie Herman can 
be heard trying to reassure his wife, before telling the dispatcher she 
was shooting intruder Paul Slater.

He can then be heard screaming at his wife to 
'shoot him...shoot him again'.

Recordings obtained by The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution of two calls to 911, detailed the terrifying moments of the burglary - one from an anxious, but calm husband and the 
other from stunned neighbors.

Donnie tells his wife Melinda: 'Just 
remember everything that I showed you, everything that I taught you, 
alright? If he opens that door, you shoot him, you understand?'

Though the husband's conversation 
with his wife is not audible on the recording, he can clearly be heard 
giving instructions to his wife and asking her questions before relaying
the information to the 911 operator.

After only a few moments on the 
phone, gunshots can be heard and Donnie tells the operator: 'She's 
shooting him! She's shooting him!' before screaming at his wife, 'Shoot 
him again! Shoot him'.

With her husband's .38 caliber 
handgun, Melinda shot Slater five times, though did not kill him. Donnie
told the operator he could hear him was pleading for his life.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

More than he bargained for: Melinda Herman can he heard firing all six rounds of the handgun, missing only once

Husband: Donnie Herman says he is proud of his wife, and he's glad his family is safe

Despite his injuries, Slater managed to run from the house and get into his SUV and drive away.

This was when a neighbor called 911 
to report gunshots. Soon after this, Melinda and her two children arrived 
at a neighbor's home, visibly shaken.

'They’re going to walk over to my house,' a man tells 911. 'I’m their neighbor. They’re okay. They’re just shooken up.'

As Donnie is still on the phone to 
the 911 dispatcher, she tells him that his neighbor is on the other 
line.

Police and EMS can be heard arriving at the scene.

Deputies found Slater bleeding in his
car in another neighbor's driveway. He remains hospitalized with 
puncture injuries to his lungs, liver and stomach.

Donnie finally receives the news he has been waiting for, more than ten minutes after he first called 911. The operator says: 'The kids are at your neighbor’s house. Your wife is okay.'

Donnie Herman appeared on Good 
Morning America after the home invasion and called his wife a 'hero' and
said she would do what 'any responsible gun owner would do'.

Home invasion: Melinda was at home with her nine-year-old twins in their Loganville home, when the suspect began ringing the doorbell before breaking in

Not exactly a clean getaway: Slater managed to return to his vehicle, but his injuries left him unable to drive, and it wasn't long before he crashed into a wooded area

It later emerged that Paul Slater 
broke into the house - thinking no one was home - with a crowbar and 
went from room-to-room until he came upon the family in 
the attic.

Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman told WSBTV
after the burglary: 'The perpetrator opens that door. Of course, at 
that time he’s staring at her, her two children and a .38 revolver.'

Sheriff Chapman told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: 'The guy’s face down, crying. The woman told him to stay down or she’d shoot again.'

WSBTV reported that Slater has a long criminal history and was released from prison in August.

The woman's husband, Donnie Herman, is just glad his wife and kids are safe.

Mr
Herman told WSBTV: 'My wife is a hero. She protected her kids. She did 
what she was supposed to do as a responsible, prepared gun owner.'
