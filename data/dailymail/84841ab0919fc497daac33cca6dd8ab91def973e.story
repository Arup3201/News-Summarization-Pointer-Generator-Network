Outbreak: Public health officials confirmed that most of the 26 people who contracted measles all visited Disneyland in Anaheim, California (pictured) 

Most of the patients visited Disneyland or Disney California Adventure between December 15 and December 20, but some may have contracted the illness from others who visited.

The new cases include three reported Monday in Southern California, including two in San Bernardino County and one in Long Beach.

Disney officials have said they are working with public health authorities to provide any necessary assistance.  

According to a health alert issued last week: 'Based on information from current cases, it is likely that a person infectious with measles was at one of the theme parks on these dates.

'People can be infectious with measles for nine days. Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and within a few days a red rash appears, usually first on the face and then spreads downward to the rest of the body.

'Measles is a highly infectious, airborne disease.'

The California Department of Public Health stated that measles was eradicated in the US in 2000, although the country remains at risk from foreign visitors carrying the infection.

The alert continued: 'Large measles outbreaks have occurred in Western Europe, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines in recent years. 

'Travelers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the U.S., resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles. Disney and other theme parks in California are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world, including those where measles is endemic.'

Of those diagnosed with the highly contagious ailment, 12 were unvaccinated and six were vaccinated.   

California Public Health official Dr Ron Chapman said: 'The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated.' He urged anyone who may have been infected to check immediately with a doctor. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing.

The CDC warned: Measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed

'If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.'

Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.

Disney officials said they had not received any reports of staff contracting measles. 

Park officials are working with the health department to provide any necessary information, said Dr. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.

The CDPH warned medics to ask patients if they have either travelled to areas with a measles problem or locations domestically with a large number of foreign tourists from infected areas.
