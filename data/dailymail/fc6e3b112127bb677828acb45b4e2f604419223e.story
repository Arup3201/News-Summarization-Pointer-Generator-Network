Liverpool's summer signing Javier Manquillo has hailed his manager Brendan Rodgers for helping him settle in quickly at the club following his move from Atletico Madrid. 

The 20-year-old, who joined on a two-year loan from the La Liga champions in the transfer window, admits he is relishing life at Anfield and says the role his manager has played in that can not be overlooked.

He told www.liverpoolfc.com: 'I get on very well with the manager here. He helps us with everything he can, which is great. He also speaks Spanish fluently too, so it's really easy for us to communicate.

'I have some fellow Spanish teammates with me over here too - Alberto Moreno, Suso and Jose Enrique are all here and there are some others in the squad who speak Spanish too, so it's been really easy for me to adapt.' 

Manquillo also revealed it has been a dream come true for him to be playing alongside Reds' skipper Steven Gerrard, someone he looked up to hugely when he was growing up in Spain as a child.

He added: 'The first time I watched Gerrard play, I was only a child. Now I play in the same team with him, he's a truly great player and it's a dream come true to share the field with him.'

Elsewhere, Liverpool will be looking to close the gap on leaders Chelsea when they face Aston Villa on Saturday evening, with Adam Lallana in contention to make his debut for the Reds.
