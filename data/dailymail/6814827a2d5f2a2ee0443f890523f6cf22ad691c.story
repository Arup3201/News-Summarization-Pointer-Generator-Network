UFC fighter Conor McGregor has posed with a mountain of money as the build-up to his July showdown with featherweight champion Jose Aldo in Las Vegas continues.

The Irish star posted a picture with a stack of millions of dollars on his Instagram account with the caption 'this week's profit.' 

He is pictured with training partner Artem Lobov and seems to have drawn inspiration from a 1964 edition of Sports Illustrated magazine, where boxing champ Muhammad Ali posed on a pile of cash.

McGregor and Aldo are currently on an eight-city, five-country tour to promote what will be the main bout at UFC 189 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on July 11.

And they had to be separated by UFC President Dana White when they faced-off at a press call in Boston on Thursday.

Aldo has held the title since 2010 when the UFC merged with the old World Extreme Cagefighting organisation. As the fourth and final featherweight champion of WEC, he carried the belt across.

McGregor certainly let Aldo know that he intends to take his crown and even faked a punch aimed at his Brazilian opponent, who just laughed and gestured that the Irishman was talking too much.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, McGregor said: 'I expect everyone in the top 10 of the featherweight division to line up and beg for forgiveness, beg to be pardoned!' 

The promotional tour has since moved on to New York and Toronto, with plenty more verbal sparring expected before the fight itself in July.

McGregor was the more agitated party as he faked a punch towards Aldo before attempting to force his way past White
