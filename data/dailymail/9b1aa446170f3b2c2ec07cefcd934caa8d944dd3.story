Cricket stars past and present have joined celebrities and fans all over the world by photographing their bat and cricket cap  as a touching tribute for Phillip Hughes.

Around Australia, families, cricket legends, celebrities, universities, companies and media organisations have set up touching tributes to the 25-year-old batsman, who died in a Sydney hospital on Thursday surrounded by families, friends and team-mates. 

Among the Australian cricketers who have taken up the cause are Steve Smith, Adam Gilchrist, David Warner, Shane Warne and Dean Jones, who have posted their tributes on social media.

Mourners from as far as the US, Europe and the Middle East have united in posting pictures of their tributes to social media with the hashtag #putoutyourbats, including members of the English team.

The simple tribute was thought up by dad and IT worker Paul Taylor, who posted a poignant image of his bat out the front of his home on social media.

'#putoutyourbats isn't about me,' Taylor said, after the tribute took off. 'It's just a way for all cricketers to show their respects to Phillip Hughes. 

'We've all played cricket in one way or another. Backyard or beach cricket, no matter what level, we've all grown up with a bat and ball.

'This is our way to connect and show our sadness. Thoughts also must go to Sean Abbott. Thank you.' 

Even Google Australia has joined in the campaign by decorating its home page with an image of a bat sitting against a wall. 

Among the most poignant tributes included a lone bat, which was placed out the front of Sydney Cricket Ground, featuring the simple inscription:  'RIP P. Hughes 63 not out forever'.

Cricket Australia has lined 63 bats in the windows of its headquarters - the number of runs Hughes had on the board when he tragically collapsed to the ground on Thursday.  

The #putoutyourbats campaign has also made a splash in England, where many players and fans have used it to pay their respects

Legends of the cricketing world, including Ian Chappell, Sachin Tendulkar, Ian Botham, Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist have paid tribute to the opener whose guts and determination defined his all-too-brief, yet spectacular, career. 

'Just an absolute tragedy that Hughesy is no longer with us. He was such an awesome young man, RIP buddy, shattered...' came the tweet from spin-king Shane Warne.

'Phillip Hughes was a young man living out his dreams,' Mr Abbott said.

'His death is a very sad day for cricket and a heartbreaking day for his family. What happened has touched millions of Australians.

'For a young life to be cut short playing our national game seems a shocking aberration.

'He was loved, admired and respected by his teammates and legions of cricket fans. Australians' thoughts and prayers are with the Hughes family.'

Hughes' hometown of Macksville in NSW is in mourning as the close-knit community struggle to come to terms with the loss of one of their own. The star cricketer begun his career as a young passionate player at Macskville Ex Services Cricket Club.

CEO of the club Judy Ward said the community was rocked by Hughes' death, and sent thoughts and prayers to the family.

'I'm struggling to work today.

'He was home about 12 times a year to see family and he'd frequently come here with his mates.'

Principal of Macksville Adventist School David McNeill said Hughes used to train on the oval next to the school and it was where he started his career as a young boy growing up.

Mr McNeill expressed his deepest sympathies over the cricketer's death in such unfortunate circumstances.

'We would like to pass our regards on the Hughes family in a situation like this,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We are all thinking for them and praying for them.

'We are sincerely saddened by the news and certainly we are thinking of the family.'
