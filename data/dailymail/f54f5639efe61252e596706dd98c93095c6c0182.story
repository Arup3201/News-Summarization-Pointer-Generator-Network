Officials believe a camel that escaped its enclosure twice on Tuesday before being clipped by a minivan probably longed for the company of other animals.

Phil the single-humped camel first escaped around 3pm and was seen grazing on the grass along the shoulder until 
citizens and the California Highway Police helped shepherd him back to safety.

He later escaped for a second time at 6.45pm and was hit by the red Honda minivan as he walked along a road in Concord.

The single-humped camel named Phil escaped his enclosure and needed to be shepherded off the roadway

The 10-year-old animal got up after the 
collision and first walked, then ran around the road, according to the 
California Highway Police.

People were out on the road for several hours getting the camel 
back to safety.

Raymond Ferrante - a land manager for a company overseeing property where the camel is being kept - says UC Davis veterinarians have examined it and said the camel did not suffer any broken bones, or other injuries.

A ranch hand in Concord, California, coaxes Phil the camel back to safety and calls out: 'Come on, dude.'

Mr Ferrante toldÂ The Contra Costa Times Phil had been kept alone for one year and added: 'Camels are very much animals that like to be around other animals.

'They're very social, they'll bust down a fence to go be with the cattle if the mood hits them.'

The camel has since been moved to a 10,000-square-foot outdoor pen enclosed by a 9-foot fence to ensure his safety, Mr Ferrante said: 'The vets want him to take it easy.'
