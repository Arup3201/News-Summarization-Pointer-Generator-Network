It was, she joked, rather like the blind leading the blind. Still, with a little help from actress Barbara Windsor the Duchess of Cornwall managed to pull off a billion euro charity deal today.

The actress giggled her way through the event with the Duchess as the pair worked the phones.

Shrugging her shoulders in bewilderment as she juggled phones on the trading floor, Camilla admitted she was utterly flummoxed as fancy dress-clad brokers frantically traded around her.

Got the giggles: Camilla and Barbara Windsor seemed to enjoy themselves, as did TV presenter Gaby Roslin

Strictly Come Dancing judge, Craig Revel Horwood, also helped with the day and the Duchess joked with him as they tried to work out what to do.

Turning to Mr Revel Horwood, whom she 
has known for many years through their shared charity work, she said: 'I
 have no idea whatsoever what I am meant to be doing!'

The Australian-born choreographer just laughed and said: 'Darling, it’s all gorgeous, let’s just do this!'

In the end they did – doing a deal for a 'yard' of euros, trading slang for one billion -  which netted £23,000 for charities the Duchess supports.

Broker Jonathan Gravestock said afterwards: 'It was huge deal, five times the size of our usual deal, and normally takes days to set up. She was a good sport.'

Camilla was on the trading floor of City firm ICAP, a leading markets operator. Each year it gives away all its revenue and commissions on a chosen day to charity and since 1993 has raised £100 million worldwide.

Camilla agreed to take part this year as donations will this year be made to two organisations of which she is patron.

Definitely 10 points! Craig Revel-Horwood looks thrilled as he realises that he's made £23,000 for charity

Shelterbox, which provides emergency shelter and supplies to families made homeless by disaster or conflict, including current victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and the National Osteoporosis Society, the only UK-wife charity dedicated to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the fragile bone disease.

The royal’s mother and grandmother both died from the debilitating condition.

Dressed in a smart blue tweed suit and pearls, the Duchess took the hustle and bustle of the floor in her stride and didn’t bat an eyelid at the often outlandish fancy dress outfits that the brokers wore for the day.

She happily posed for photographs with gladiators, killer clowns,  basketball players and even a team of Moldovian Eurovision Song Contest entrants – whatever that may be.

Down at the i-swap Beach Party, she roared as she was greeted by two female financiers wearing inflatable Sumo outfits and bikinis and even tried her hand at their interactive surfing game (although she declined the proffered glass of Malibu and pineapple).

Unusual: Some of the brokers had arrived in fancy dress, including this pair of female sumo wrestlers

After conducting a dollar swap with the Duchess, broker Richard Mason said: 'She did well. She seemed a little nervous but probably not as nervous as I am. I was shaking.'

Emerging markets broker Duncan Fotheringham also helped Camilla with another deal and added: 'She’s just dealt with Copenhagen and closed a trade, superbly, I might add, with a lot of style and panache.'

Other celebrities on the floor included Homeland actor Damian Lewis and Barbara Windsor, who also campaigns for the National Osteoporosis Society.

Camilla told the actress: 'I’ve not idea what we are doing but will try to do my best.' Barbara replied: 'Nor have I, we could get into trouble you know.'

Speaking afterwards Mr Revel Horwood, who is a patron of the National Osteoporosis Society, said the Duchess had been 'huge fun'.

'I couldn’t quite believe what we were doing or the figure we were talking about. I had to borrow a red studded glove from one of the brokers as my hand was shaking and sweating so much that I couldn’t hold the phone,' he said.

The Strictly judge, who has just undergone hip replacement surgery at the age of just 48, added of his condition: 'Thankfully I appear to be recovering well. 

'It seems as if I have a touch of osteoarthritis, which is  interesting giving the work the Duchess and I do, but I did a few spins last week and although I was a bit worried about it, thankfully my hip didn’t pop out.

'I’m now in rehearsals for panto. Things seem to be going well.'
