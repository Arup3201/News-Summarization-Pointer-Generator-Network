A Minnesota jury has heard the shocking moment a 65-year-old homeowner shot dead two teenage intruders in his basement, and then told his female victim 'You're dying... b****.'

Byron Smith recorded the double slaying in his Little Falls basement and on the second day of his murder trial the crystal clear audio was played to a silent courtroom, except for a woman holding back sobs.

In the recording, glass can be heard breaking, movement, then two gunshots as Nick Brady, 17, groans, 'Oh.' To this, Smith responds: 'You're dead,' the Star Tribune reports.

Then the rustling of a tarpaulin can be heard and a dragging sound as Smith, breathing heavily, moves the teen into his workshop to stop his dead body staining the carpet.

Accused: Byron Smith, center, comes out of a Morrison County courtroom in Little Falls, Minnesota, Monday, April 21, 2014, during a break in his trial. Smith shot and killed two teenagers who broke into his house on Thanksgiving Day 2012

Trial: The 65-year-old faces two counts of premeditated first-degree murder for the killings of Haile Kifer, 18, and Nick Brady, 17, who broke into his home on Thanksgiving Day 2012

Moments later, jurors heard the sound of a gun reloading and deep breaths.

Then a female voice mumbles 'Nick.' It's 18-year-old Haile Kifer - Brady's cousin.

Again, gunshots ring out and then Kifer falls down the stairs.

Smith says 'Oh, sorry about that' and a terrified Kifer screams 'oh my god!'

The old man then says 'you're dying,' before shooting her again and calling her 'b****' twice.

More dragging sound is heard and then a final crack of a gun, which is where prosecutors turned off the sinister recording.

Smith is 
charged with first-degree premeditated murder in the slayings of Brady and Kifer on Thanksgiving Day 
2012.

The killings rocked the small central 
Minnesota city of about 8,000 and stirred debate about how far people 
can go in defending their homes.

Charged again: Byron Smith had his charge increased from second degree murder to first-degree after killing two teenagers

The horrifying audiotape came after 
jurors listened to an interview from the day after the shootings in 
which Smith matter-of-factly described what happened in chilling detail,
 telling authorities he finished Kifer off with a shot under her chin 
because a .22-caliber 'doesn't go through bone very well.'

Prosecutors said during opening statements that Smith planned the killings and was lying in wait in his basement.

Smith's attorney said his client was terrified after several increasingly violent break-ins and was hiding after he heard a window break and footsteps upstairs.

'He became frightened and scared to live in his own home,' said Smith's attorney, Steve Meshbesher, later adding, 'He began to wear a holster and pistol in his own house. That is how afraid he is, and became.'

Assistant Washington County Attorney Brent Wartner told jurors that Smith thought a neighbor girl had been breaking into his home. On that day, he moved his truck away from his house, sat in his basement 'and he waited,' Wartner said.

'He's down in the basement, in a chair, tucked between two bookcases at the bottom of the stairs. He said he was down there reading a book ... with his Mini-14, a .22-caliber revolver, some energy bars and a bottle of water,' Wartner said.

During the afternoon the jury was also shown several photographs of the basement where the shootings occurred.

BCA Forensic Science Lab forensic scientist Nate Pearlson testified that the teens bodies were found partially wrapped in the same camouflage tarp.

Kifer’s sweatshirt hood was up and her purse was next to her body.

Using gunshot residue, Pearlson said he was able to determine the two bullet holes in the hood of Kifer’s sweatshirt were likely made at the distance of about six inches and 12 inches - or point blank range.

Under Minnesota law, a person may use deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling, but authorities have said Smith crossed a line when he continued to shoot the teens after they were no longer a threat.

The teens were not armed, but Smith told authorities he assumed they were - and he thought they had taken guns from his house in a past burglary.

In the recordings, Smith can be heard politely recounting details to investigators. As the recordings were played Monday, Smith sat still at the defense table, at some points crying.

Smith told Morrison County Sheriff's Sgt. Jeremy Luberts that he was in his basement when he heard someone rattle his door, followed by footsteps on his deck and a shadow in a window.

'I'm getting seriously stressed 
because somebody wants in,' he said. After a moment of silence, he said 
he heard a window break, and footsteps inside.

Smith
 told authorities he saw Brady begin descending the basement steps, then
 fired once Brady's hips came into view. Brady fell.

'He's looking, facing up at me, and I shoot him in the face. I want him dead,' Smith told investigators.

Smith
 said he put Brady's body on a tarp so he wouldn't get blood into his 
carpet, dragged it into his workshop, reloaded his rifle and sat down.

Smith
 described feeling adrenaline, and 'blood was pounding in my ears.' He 
said he also felt he was being ganged up on, something he called one of 
his 'red buttons.' So when he saw Kifer come down the stairs minutes 
later, 'I killed her too.'

He shot her, and when he tried to 'finish her off' his rifle jammed and she laughed, he said.

'I
 just pulled out the 22 and I shot her,' he told authorities. He said he
 then pulled her into the workshop, but she was still gasping, so 'I did
 a good, clean finishing shot and she gave out the death twitch.'

He
 said he didn't call police because the teens were already dead and 
'just cause my Thanksgiving is screwed up I don't need to screw up 
yours.' The next day, he asked a neighbor to call police.

Scene: Smith has always claimed self-defense, saying he feared the teens were armed and he was on edge after earlier repeated break-ins at his home

Friends and teachers had expressed their shock at the deaths and described Haile as a popular role model

Smith is a retired security engineer for the U.S. Department of State. Kifer and Brady were cousins.

The two were well-known in the community, and both were involved in sports.

Court documents from another case show Brady had burglarized Smith's property at least twice in the months before he was killed.

Earlier,
 Meshbesher told jurors: 'This is not a case of whodunit. Mr. Smith is 
the person who shot and killed those two people, but he is not 
criminally responsible for the deaths. He is not guilty of murder.'

Assistant Washington County Attorney 
Brent Wartner told jurors that Smith thought a neighborhood girl had been 
breaking into his home, so on that Thanksgiving Day, Smith sat in his 
basement, waiting. 

Wartner said Smith
 heard the door of his house rattle at about 12:30 p.m., then someone 
walking across the deck, then a window breaking. 'And he waited,' Wartner said.

But Meshbesher said his client was hiding after break-ins that had gotten increasingly more violent.

'He
 became frightened and scared to live in his own home,' he said of 
Smith, later adding, 'He began to wear a holster and pistol in his own 
house. That is how afraid he is, and became.'

Joker: Friends remembered Brady as an out-going student who loved to make people smile

Prosecutors
 say as Brady descended the basement steps, Smith shot him in the chest,
 then in the back while Brady fell, Wartner said. Smith fired a final 
shot into Brady's head, the bullet passing through Brady's hand, Wartner
 said.

Smith put Brady's body on a tarp so he wouldn't get blood on his 
carpet, dragged the body into his workshop, reloaded his Mini-14 rifle 
and sat down again, the prosecutor said.

A
 few minutes later, Kifer walked down the stairs and Smith shot her, 
Wartner said. He tried another shot, but his rifle jammed, Wartner said,
 and Smith told police he believed Kifer laughed at him.

'He
 was angry,' Wartner said. He said that Smith then pulled out his 
revolver and he shot her twice in the head, once in the left eye and 
once behind the left ear.

Smith
 dragged Kifer's body into the workshop and laid it on top of Brady's, 
Wartner said. Smith told investigators he thought he heard Kifer 
gasping, so he placed his revolver under her chin and fired what he told
 police was a 'good clean finishing shot to the head,' the assistant 
prosecutor said.

After
 their deaths, authorities said a car linked to Brady and Kifer 
contained prescription drugs that had been stolen from another house, 
apparently the day before they were killed.
