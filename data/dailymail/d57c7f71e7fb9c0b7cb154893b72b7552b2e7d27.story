Defense lawyers for three former US Naval academy football players accused of raping their female classmate spent an estimate of 30 hours over the course of a few days asking the victim inappropriate questions about her sex life.

In addition to asking the victim whether or not she apologized to one of her classmates for being a 'ho,' they asked her if she was wearing a bra and underwear at the party and asked her how she opened her mouth to perform oral sex.

The defense tried to argue that the victim's opening her mouth counted as 'active participation' and therefore qualified as sexual consent.

The alleged assault took place in 
April 2012 at an off-campus house in Annapolis referred to as 'the 
football house.' The then 20-year-old Naval Academy Sophomore woke up 
with bruises after a
night of heavy drinking and later learned from friends and social media
that three football players claimed to have had sex with her while she 
was intoxicated

One of the accused attackers tweeted, 'the train tickets were on the low,' indicating it was easy to engage with the victim sexually.

The victim was at first hesitant to press charges against classmates Trav'es Bush, Eric Graham, and Joshua Tate. The Girl's attorney Susan Burke said that when the girl first reported allegations to Navy Criminal Investigators she was disciplined for drinking and the boys were allowed to continue playing.

In early 2013, the female student decided to seek legal help and the Navy re-opened the investigation, Burke said.

Now the girl's rape trial is an 
Article 32 proceeding, a military hearing meant to determine whether or 
not a case is trial material.

According to The New York Times, Article 32 proceedings, 'permit questions not allowed in civilian courts and can include 
cross-examinations of witnesses so intense that legal experts say they 
frighten many victims from coming forward.'

Many military Legal experts want to get rid of Article 32 proceedings. Diane H. Mazur, a professor at The University of Florida said, 'What this case shows is that we think the military justice system can somehow solve the sexual assault problem, but it can’t.'

Explicitly sexual questions like the one's asked by the defense in this trial would not be asked in a civilian case. 

Even though people like Mazur are against the proceedings, Defense Department Officials say the proceedings are meant to protect innocent victims and ensure that there is sufficient enough evidence to go to trial.

Senator Kristen E. Gildebrand is currently working on a bill that would remove military assault cases from the chain of command.

Susan Burke, the victim's lawyer filed a federal lawsuit to strip the Naval Academy's superintendent of authority over the case.

Her case is an Article 32 military proceeding which allows for personal questions to determine whether a case is fit for trial
