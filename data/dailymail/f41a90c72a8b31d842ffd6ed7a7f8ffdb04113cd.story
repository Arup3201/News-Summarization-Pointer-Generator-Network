A skier captured the heart-stopping moment the snow cracked underneath him as he sped along, triggering an avalanche.

Chris Stillwell was filming using a camera mounted on his helmet while skiing on a sunny day in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.

Suddenly, cracks emerged in the snow in front of him, creating a trench that he couldn't help but plunge into.

The moment the snow split. It created a trench that Mr Stillwell could not help but plough into

Rocky Mountain National Park is located in the north-central region of the U.S. state of Colorado. It features mountain views, lakes and a variety of wildlife. It attracts millions of visitors a year.

In September both the park and the town of Estes Park were damaged by heavy rains.

The
 park was closed to visitors and some roads leading to the park were 
closed for several weeks. Flooding waters, rocks, and debris washed away
 parking areas and roads.

Officials say the danger of avalanches is receding, but several slides have been reported in the past few days.

Although his visor is obscured after the fall, Mr Stillwell's camera picks up the mass of snow as it slides down the slope
