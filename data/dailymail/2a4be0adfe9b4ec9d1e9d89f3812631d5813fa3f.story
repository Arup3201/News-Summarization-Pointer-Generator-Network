The lone survivor of an elite fire crew that was overcome by flames during an Arizona wildfire has described the agonizing moment he heard his comrades' phones ringing in the truck where they had been left behind as their wives called - after he had already learned that all 19 had perished in the blaze.

Brendan McDonough, 21, has broken his silence to recount the moments leading up the tragedy that claimed every other member of his hotshot firefighting team in Yarnell Hill on June 30.

'Whoever didn't bring their phone, I could hear phones ringing, knowing that it was their wives, their family,' McDonough recounted in the exclusive interview with ABC News, which aired on Wednesday.

But he had already received a call that all the men had perished after winds suddenly changed direction, sending the 50-foot-high flames hurtling in their direction and cutting off their escape route.

Heartbroken: Brendan McDonough, the only surviving member of the Prescott hotshots crew, has described how he fell apart when he received a call saying the 19 bodies had been found

'I sunk. Sunk into my seat, I sunk into myself,' he said.

McDonough, who has been fighting fires with the hotshots for three seasons, described the hours before the tragedy - and his guilt that only he returned to the fire station in Prescott.

'I asked a million times, "Why am I 
sitting here and why isn't someone else? Why aren't they sitting here 
with me?"' McDonough told ABC.

But he survived because his captain had assigned him the role of lookout to watch the fire's movement and to monitor weather changes as the rest of the team battled the flames.

He called it a 'typical day... not threatening' as the men headed across the hillside. But around 4pm, the wind began to change direction - and his team saw the flames coming for them.

'From where they were, they could see it
picking up,' he said, disputing earlier claims that they did not notice the sudden change.

McDonough said that the team urged him to retreat if he needed to.

He responded that they should contact him if they needed anything and his captain, Jesse Steed, simply replied: 'All right, I'll see you soon.'

But at 4.47pm, a radio call came through that the men had been forced to deploy their emergency fire shelters in a last ditch effort to save their lives.

A paramedic officer was taken by 
helicopter to the scene and thought he could hear voices - before 
realizing they were coming from the radio. He confirmed the 19 deaths.

'Why wasn't I there with them?' McDonough
said he asked himself after hearing the call.

'That's all I could think, to pray for their 
safety... I'm kind of numb at that point. I'd cried a lot. And I came to
a point where I just didn't have any more tears.'

McDonough said he could hardly face the families of the men as he returned to the station. The group had 10 children between them and two were soon to be first-time fathers.

'Coming home, that was the worst feeling
ever,' he said. 'Knowing that these families would see me, but not anyone else off
that crew. No one. I was the only person they're going to see.'

He went on to speak at a memorial for the men and attended 19 funerals - all while questions swirled around what had led 19 elite firefighters to their deaths.

Deputy state forester Jerry Payne last week sparked anger when he blamed the crew's leader Eric Marsh, who perished with his men, for violating firefighting rules - but other state officials criticized him for the conclusion. He is not involved in the investigation, which is ongoing.

But McDonough said he does not blame any of the men.

'I never question the decisions they've made,' he said. 'I never questioned them before, why should I question them now? It's not their fault. Wasn't a bad decision.'

He said now all he can do is continue firefighting for his 19 fallen friends and their families.

'I can't fail them,' he told ABC. 'I can't stop trying because I feel like they somewhat look to me because I'm the only one left.'
