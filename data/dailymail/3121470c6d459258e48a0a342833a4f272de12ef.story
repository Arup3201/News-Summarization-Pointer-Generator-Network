Raheem Sterling's contract talks at Liverpool have taken a dramatic twist after it emerged he is prepared to turn down one of the biggest deals in the club’s history.

Negotiations with Sterling have reached yet another impasse and it is understood that even if Liverpool offer £180,000 a week he will not sign.

Sterling, who has turned down a number of offers from Liverpool, believes his best position is in the three forward positions and is becoming increasingly concerned about his position at wing-back.

The forward, who has vowed to concentrate on his football for the rest of the season and not be distracted by contract talks, has returned to Merseyside after spending a week with England.

Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group now face a massive battle to persuade Sterling, 20, that his future is at Anfield because it appears it is not just the financial terms causing an issue.

Sterling has held talks with Liverpool over his future throughout the season but decided to wait for the summer after they could not agree terms. He performed well in England’s 4-0 victory over Lithuania last Friday when he played in his preferred position as a forward.

He had been encouraged by England’s head coach Roy Hodgson to swap positions with Danny Welbeck during the game and responded with a goal and assist for Harry Kane.Hodgson believes Sterling is playing better football for England than his club.

He is set to recover in time for Saturday’s trip to Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League, but his position in the team is not straightforward. 

Sterling finished the 2-1 defeat at home to Manchester United playing as a left wing-back. Although he was used in a forward position for wins over Swansea and Manchester City, he was also used as a wing-back against Blackburn in the FA Cup and Burnley in the league.
