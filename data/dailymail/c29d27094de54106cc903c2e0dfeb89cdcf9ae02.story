Australia's largest floating Christmas tree has been switched on in Geelong to rapturous applause from a 15,000 strong crowd

The tree has caused a lot of controversy since the city's mayor Darryn Lyons announced that the steel tree would cost the city about $1 million over the next five years.

Some locals were reportedly furious at the extortionate amount of money being spent on the tree, considering there is a shortage of jobs in the flailing town.

The city has set aside $500,000 for the first year costs of the tree.

$450,000 will be spent on the construction, installation and maintenance of the tree while a further $50,000 will be required to hold the tree in reserve and cover any additional costs.

It is believed the tree will cost $135,000 a year until 2019.

Geelong Mayor Darryn Lyons told reporters that the tree would create up to $10 million in revenue for the city and defended its stature in the community.

Speaking to the Herald Sun, Mayor Lyons said the tree is ‘a huge tourism puller’.

“No-one really has ever done anything about boosting tourism here. We’ve got to look at the future ….it’s about jobs … we live in a beautiful place and Geelong people tend to take it for granted. Getting the Melbourne dollar is enormous.”

The tree will be a prominant feature of the Waterfront throughout the festive season. At night the tree features stunning lightshows every half hour from 8.30pm.
