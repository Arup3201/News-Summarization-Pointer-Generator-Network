Labour has surged to its biggest lead over the Tories in the polls for a decade as female voters continue to desert the Prime Minister.

If a General Election was held today Ed Miliband's party would probably secure 41 per cent of the vote while David Cameron's Conservatives would get 29 per cent - down four per cent in a month.

Female support for the Tories is plummeting as among women 26 per cent more would vote for Labour - 51 to 25 - whereas Labour only get seven per cent more support from men - 36 to 29.

Result: A joint Guardian ICM poll today gave Labour their biggest lead over the Tories for a decade

More bad news: The poll also found that many more women would vote for Labour than the Tories (the remaining numbers would vote for other parties)

Losing the battle: A new poll shows David Cameron's Tories are leaking votes to Ed Miliband's Labour after his party gained its biggest lead for a decade

A further bitter blow for the Prime Minister will be that his pledge to offer an in/out EU referendum has not secured the support he had hoped for.

Instead Eurosceptic rival UKIP's share has gone up three points to nine per cent, according to a Guardian/ICM poll out today.

The party has also broken a promise made by the Chancellor while in opposition to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million.

But by freezing the threshold at £325,000 to 2019 to pay for social care changes the Conservatives could lose even more core votes.

Meanwhile the ailing Liberal Democrats are also losing support as heir share of the vote has sunk two per cent to 13.

Disappointed: David Cameron's promise from an in/out EU referendum has not helped at the polls either

Scandal: Chris Huhne, pictured with his partner Carina Trimingham, resigned as an MP after admitting last week he asked his ex-wife Vicky Pryce to take his speeding points

Scramble: All the political parties are sending their big guns to Eastleigh, including Nick Clegg, in a highly-anticipated by-election

The Tories have not had such a low share of the vote since 2003, when Tony Blair's government received a boost when Saddam Hussein was toppled.

This was before Iraq lurched into civil war and the scandal over the dodgy dossier became public.

David Cameron's ratings are similar to John Major's and will be tested later this month during the Eastleigh by-election, the seat vacated by disgraced former minister Chris Huhne. 

The latest ICM/Guardian poll shows a dramatic decline in the Conservative share of the vote, but David Cameron’s personal ratings are down.

Only 31 per cent say he 'understands people like me', a fall from 42 per cent in August 2010. One in three (37 per cent) thinks he’s 'good in a crisis'.

But the Labour lead appears to be despite Ed Miliband's leadership as only 18 per cent think he’s good in a crisis, and 35 per cent thought he 'understands people like me', only slightly better than Mr Cameron.
