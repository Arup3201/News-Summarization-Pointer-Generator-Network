The mother and her infant son who were killed in an explosion and fire in Sydney's inner west this month were laid to rest in the same coffin today, as loved ones remembered them as 'inseparable'.

Bianka O'Brien, 31, and her 11-month-old son, Jude, were killed when the blast ripped through the convenience store below their apartment in suburban Rozelle on 4 September and caused a fire than engulfed the building.

Father and husband John O'Brien spoke lovingly of his son and wife in a heart-wrenching eulogy at their joint funeral at St Joseph's Catholic Church in Rozelle.

'When they found Jude, he was with his mum,' John O'Brien told the packed service. 'There was no happier place for Jude.'

Mr O'Brien had left home for work less than an hour before the explosion that claimed the lives of his wife, son. Another resident of the building, Chris Noble, 27, was also killed.

Mourners gathered on a bright spring day for the funeral service, hugging each other for comfort outside the church. 

Bianka and her baby son were placed together in a beautiful white and silver coffin adorned with pink, purple and orange flowers for the service.

Mr O'Brien joined the pallbearers in carrying the casket from the church. The pair will be buried at Woronora Cemetery, Sutherland, in Sydney's south, near where Bianka worked as a hairdresser.

'Bianka was everything to me,' Mr O'Brien said in his eulogy, describing his wife as 'loving and sweet' but also 'the toughest woman in the planet.'

When their son arrived in their lives, it 'changed everything,' he said.

He mourned for 'a sweet little boy… You wouldn't even know if he was hungry, he just smiled away.'

He told friends and family gathered at the church he found solace in knowing the two most important people in his life were together at the end.

Friends described the joy that Jude brought to the family and their friends.

'I now believe that, through Bianka and John, an angel came to us: Jude,' a friend told mourners.

He added, 'Bianka was no ordinary person. Why take them away from us?'

He said Bianka and her son were inseparable.

Bianka's best friend, Lucille O'Brien, spoke of the time the pair went shopping for her wedding dress.

'The wedding was beautiful. She was the happiest I've seen her. To my best friend, Bianka. I love you ... I don't want to say goodbye just yet'

Mourners dressed in black and grey began arriving at St Joseph's Catholic Church in Sydney at around 10am. 

The service was attended by loved ones, friends, police and ambulance officers

About 120 people attended the moving service, including 20 NSW police officers, who lined the footpath in a guard of honour as Mr O'Brien people entered the church.

Women carried bouquets of flowers and men hid their eyes behind dark glasses, as mourners comforted and embraced each other outside the church.

An order of service given to mourners included photos of the family in happier times.

'Your presence we miss, your memory we treasure, loving you always, forgetting you never,' read a poem on the first page.

The devastated father and husband of Jude and Bianka arrived at the church at 10.47 am. 

He held his head high as he walked up the steps into the church and touched the holy water with his right hand before entering.

A friend reassuringly tapped him twice on his back.

Suited members of the ambulance service, who helped in the search for Jude and Bianka after the explosion, arrived next along with some mothers and babies in prams.

Police superintendent Clive Ainley told Daily Mail Australia that police officers and the Rozelle community are all hurting after the loss of three beautiful people in such awful circumstances.

'It's a traumatic experience. We've provided welfare to cope with the stress.'

'A lot of police here from Leichhardt were on the scene. Some of the officers are relatives of Bianka and Jude.

The service for Bianka and Jude was also attended by emergency workers who came to pay their respects, after working at the scene of the Rozelle blast

Superintendent Ainley said the tragic deaths of Bianka and Jude, as well as of Chris Noble, will continue to devastate the community. 

'Rozelle is a small community and the whole community bonded together,' he said.

'This is a major incident for Rozelle.. The likes of which we will probably never see again.'

The police paid their respects, in the midst of the investigation to discover what started the blaze in the convenience store.

'We formed a guard of honour which we usually do at police funerals because there are police officers who are related to the family

'I can't comment on the investigation, it's ongoing.' 

John O'Brien spoke to the ambulance members before going alone to look at the bodies of his loved ones.

The service began at 11am to the song 'You Are The Sunshine of my Life.' 

After the readings a touching video presentation was played to the packed church, showing the young family's tragically short lives together.

The funeral service booklet was filled with photos that documented Bianka and John's happy eight years together and their smiley baby Jude. John described Bianka as being 'everything to him.' He told mourners how his 'sweet' son had come along.

Music was an important part of the service, with 'You are the Sunshine of my Life', 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' and 'Tears in Heaven' played

Photos from when John met the 'love of his life' Bianka were shown, as well as pictures of their beautiful baby boy.

The video played to the sound of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.

'Bianka and Jude may your guardian angels be with you in paradise,' read the order of service.

Photographs of Jude and Bianka were placed on their shared coffin inside the church. 

The community continues to rally round the families of those affected by the tragedy.

Darling Street reopened to traffic on Wednesday and now a 'shop local' campaign and a fundraising concert have been set up to help recover some of the $1.5 million of revenue lost by local businesses.

The Rozelle Fire Appeal Community Concert will take place on Sunday 21, September, in King George Park, Rozelle.

There will be music, children's entertainment and a picnic between 12pm and 3pm in the park.
