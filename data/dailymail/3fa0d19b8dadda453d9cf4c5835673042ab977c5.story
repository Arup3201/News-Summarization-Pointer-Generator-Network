Nick Robinson isn't known for his sense of humour, and neither is Wayne Rooney for that matter, so when the journalist attempted a hair joke at the balding footballer's expense, the tumbleweed started rolling.

In fact, things looked like they might get a bit hairy as a bemused Rooney responded with the sort of death stare he usually reserves for overzealous footballing opponents.

He did, however, stop short of giving the BBC political editor the hairdryer treatment his Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson is so famous for.

The follicularly-challenged pair met as Robinson hosted Manchester United's annual Unicef gala dinner on Wednesday night.

The awkward silence descended as Robinson asked the question in reference to Rooney's recent and much-publicised hair replacement treatment at a top Harley Street clinic.

Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick looked on with blank expressions as Rooney failed to see the funny side.

It is more than 18 months since Rooney paid £30,000 for a hair transplant.

He said at the time he was delighted 
with the result, and, in the months immediately after the operation, he 
boasted a relatively thick crop.

But recent pictures show that it may be time for a trip back to the clinic.

Robinson admitted to his Twitter fans
 that he nervous prior to  hosting the event and afterwards sounded 
uncertain about how his attempt at humour was received.

'I've just publicly asked Wayne Rooney 
for advice about dealing with my baldness. Think I got away with it but 
not entirely sure.'

Wayne Rooney failed to be drawn on the matter and instead took to Twitter to reflect on his recent Christmas visit to Christies Hospital where he put a smile on the children's faces.

Nadeem Uddin Khan, director of the Harley
 Street Hair Clinic, where Wayne had his treatment told Mail Online: 
'Wayne’s treatment, like that performed by the Harley Street Hair Clinic
 on all our clients, involves an element of lifetime support.

'In some cases this can include continuing treatment if required to complement the original procedure.'
