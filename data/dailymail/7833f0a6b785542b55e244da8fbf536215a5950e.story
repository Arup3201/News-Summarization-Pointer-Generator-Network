A six-year-old girl was left alone in Bali after her parents were arrested over an alleged £1.6million cocaine smuggling operation on the Indonesian island.

Kitty Ponder has been looked after by their maid and gardener since Julian Ponder and Rachel Dougall were detained the day after her birthday.

Mr Ponder, 49, and Miss Dougall, 38, face death by firing squad if they are convicted of being part of the alleged drugs ring.

Torn apart: Rachel Dougall and her husband Julian Ponder have been separated from their daughter Kitty, who remains at their luxury holiday villa

Their daughter may never see them 
again if they are taken to the notorious Kerobokan jail to be put on 
death row, as happened to two Australians who were part of the infamous 
'Bali Nine' smuggling ring in 2005.

The couple are among four Brits accused of being part of an 'international network' attempting to smuggle 4.7 kilograms (11 pounds) of the narcotic on to the holiday island.

They are suspected of being the buyers of the cocaine allegedly carried in the suitcase of mother-of-two Lindsay Sandiford, 55.

Kitty is now being looked after at Mr
 Ponder and Miss Dougall's luxury villa by Dayu Ariani, 33, wife Ketut 
Suranchana and their young son, according to The Sun.

Mr Ariani said: 'We were shocked when the police came.

'They came with Mr Julian and 
collected a lot of bags and left with the mother and father. We have 
been looking after Kitty, who is a sweet girl.

'She thinks her parents are coming 
home. We cannot tell her the truth. Nobody from the authorities has 
taken any steps to look after the girl.'

As the first pictures emerged of the couple on Monday, their friends on the island dismissed the allegations as a 'joke', according to the Daily Telegraph.

They said Miss Dougall, from Brighton, was a 'party girl' who had been innocently caught up in a 'bigger game'. Distraught relatives had been calling Bali from Britain worried about the well-being of her daughter.

Housewife Mrs Sandiford was initially 
the focus of the investigation after she was arrested at Denpasar  airport last
 week and used in a police sting. She was forced to pose for pictures on
 Monday next to packages containing the Class A drug.

The
 attention has now shifted to Mr Ponder and Miss Dougall, however, who 
used to restore antiques together from fashionable homes in Brighton and
 west London.

Looking strained, Miss Dougall was yesterday pictured wearing an orange prison-issue shirt and shorts outside a police station in Bali.

As she was led away at Bali police headquarters, she shouted: ‘It’s a fit-up, get us a decent lawyer. I’m being treated badly.’

Her husband, next to her, shouted: ‘Get us an international lawyer.’

Until
 2008, Mr Ponder ran an antiques restoration business, Pen Productions 
Ltd. Their home was a £500,000 apartment overlooking the seafront in 
Brighton.

He was previously director of a London-based caterers and party organisers, which collapsed with debts of £500,000 in 2004, according to The Times.

The pair, who now live in Bali, were arrested after Indonesian police apparently persuaded Mrs Sandiford to take part in a sting operation following the discovery of the drugs inside the lining of her suitcase.

Mrs Sandiford, a former legal secretary from Redcar in Cleveland, was arrested at Ngurah Rai airport after she arrived on a flight from Bangkok on May 19.

After being interrogated for days, she apparently confessed she had been due to meet Miss Dougall, who had asked her to stay at a hotel in Kuta, southern Bali.

'The reason she co-operated was, we pointed out that if she stayed silent, the whole illegal drug importation attempt would be on her shoulders,' said customs official Made Wijaya.

Last Friday police arrested Mr Ponder 
moments after Mrs Sandiford had allegedly handed him the drugs disguised as a present in pink wrapping paper.

Officers
 then arrested Miss Dougall at his apartment in Tabanan, central Bali, which has a swimming pool, playhouse and beautiful views of the mountains.

They allegedly found 49kg of cocaine in a bag, along with a Marlboro cigarette packet containing 23kg of the drug, according to The Times.

But a friend of the couple described the police's suggestion that they were part of an 'international network' of drug traffickers as 'a joke', adding: 'She [Miss Dougall] is a party girl and I believe that she has been caught up in this somehow.

'I think she has been coerced and wrapped up in a bigger game than she really understood.'

Another expat said: 'She always had these fabulous designer clothes on. You'd see her dancing on the tables. She was the life of the party.'

Another 
Briton, Paul Beales, was arrested a day later at a villa in Kuta, where police allegedly found 3.36g of hash, and an Indian man was also detained.

In an interview with The Times, he protested his innocence.

'This is a nightmare. I've got two little girls of four and nine and I have no idea what they are thinking about why their dad hasn't come home. I'm not involved with drugs. I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm scared, of course I am.'

All the suspects face the prospect of being executed by a firing squad if they are convicted.

It emerged that Mrs Sandiford is ‘singing like a bird’ about the drugs syndicate she was allegedly involved with.

Police sources said she has spent several days being interrogated by narcotics squad officers. Her nights are spent in a mosquito-plagued cell 10ft long and 8ft wide.

A senior officer said: ‘We don’t expect to be making any announcements until at least next week. There is a great deal of work to be done but fortunately the information is  flowing from one area very well.’

It is understood Bali police have been in
 touch with British officers about Mrs Sandiford’s background after she 
claimed she was forced to carry the drugs because her two sons, Lewis, 
23, and Elliot, 21, were threatened. Her elder son was jailed for six 
years in 2009 for a series of robberies in London.

Last night Miss Dougall’s father Barry, 64, a retired antiques dealer, said: ‘It looks like she is in a lot of trouble out there.’

He was jailed soon after the birth of his daughter and served three-and-a-half years for fraud. He last saw her in Brighton when she was 18.

Speaking from his one-bedroom flat in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, he added: ‘I have led a chequered life. But if Rachel ever needed anything I would be there for her.’

Mr Ponder’s ex-wife, Kotkanoke Bradburn, said she was shocked to learn of his arrest.

Speaking from her home in Stafford, she said: ‘He was never aggressive and never harmed me in any way.’

She married Mr Ponder in 1989 after she came to England from her native Thailand to study English. They separated after three years.
