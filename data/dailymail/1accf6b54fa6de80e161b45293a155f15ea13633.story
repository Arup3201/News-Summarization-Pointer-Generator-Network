Scathing: Steven Spielberg criticised the way some films are financed these days

Steven Spielberg has vowed he will never again edit his films to make them more politically correct.

The
 Oscar-winning director, 64, told the Daily Mail that he ‘deeply regrets’ changing a scene
 in his 1982 movie E.T. for a 20th anniversary DVD release.

The
 guns of officials hunting the eponymous alien were replaced by 
walkie-talkies, supposedly to make the film more suitable for family 
viewing.

But despite 
his reservations about the changes, Spielberg said both the original and
 modified versions will be released on Blu-ray to celebrate the 30th 
anniversary of the film, which won four Academy Awards.

‘A lot of kids only know E.T. from the digitally-enhanced version,’ he explained.

‘So
 in order not to traumatise that entire generation, I’ll probably come 
out with the old version and the enhanced version, but sell both at the 
same time, for the same price, so you can make your choice.’  

Spielberg was speaking in Richmond, Virginia, where he is shooting the presidential biopic Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. 

In a scathing attack on the current state of Hollywood, Spielberg revealed there are ‘not a lot of films’  made over the past 20 years that he would watch.

The director of such blockbusters as Jaws, Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Saving Private Ryan said that before starting a new project, he always revisits classic films from the golden age of cinema for inspiration instead.

He cites The Seven Samurai, Lawrence Of Arabia and It's A Wonderful Life - as well as silent movies - as the films he uses for 'getting his engine started'.

‘They’re all told visually and they’re 
all told with hyper-extended performance and with wonderful use of a 
frame,’ he told the Sunday Times.

Spielberg also criticised the way modern films are financed.

He argued that producers are wrongly 
more interested in backing concepts rather than directors and writers, and that
 the hedge funds backing films demand the guarantee of a big actor. 

‘My whole career has survived without big movie stars,’ he said.

Despite his blunt assessment, Spielberg revealed he probably sees more than 100 movies a year – and never walks out, no matter how bad a film may seem.

‘I even get inspired by movies that aren’t very good, because there’s always something good in movies that are collectively thought of as a failure. There’s good in everything, I find,’ he said.

He recently completed a film based on the theatrical hit War Horse, due for release in the UK on January 13.

The play about the brutality of the First World War, seen through the eyes of a horse, was based on a children’s book by Michael Morpurgo.

It is still being staged to packed houses in London and New York. 

The film stars Jeremy Irvine, Emily Watson and Peter Mullan.

War Horse is one of six films Spielberg has in production, along with a further 24 in development. 

The director has no plans to retire, instead hoping to direct ‘as long as I can’.

While in the UK filming War Horse, Spielberg fell in love with English idiosyncrasies.

He said he and his children became ‘sappy devotees’ of the X Factor, and he liked the way the crew on set called him ‘Guv’.
