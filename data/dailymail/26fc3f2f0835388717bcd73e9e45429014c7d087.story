Devoted: Queen Victoria with servant Abdul Karim

He was the Indian servant whose relationship with Queen Victoria caused controversy throughout her kingdom, violating Victorian taboos of race and class and even threatening her place in history.

Now the current Queen is set to cash in on Abdul Karim’s scandalous links with her great-great-grandmother by renting out his former home on the Balmoral Estate.

The recently renovated Royal Deeside retreat has even been named Karim Cottage and can be hired for between £705 and £1,080 per week.

Nearly 120 years ago, the cottage was home to Karim, a servant who was at the centre of a row that even led the Prince of Wales to threaten to have his mother declared insane.

In 1897, Queen Victoria celebrated her Diamond Jubilee – the first British monarch to do so.

But beyond the grand celebrations on Britain’s streets, a war was raging between Victoria and her court over her relationship with her Indian servant, mirroring that of her earlier friendship with her Scottish servant, John Brown.

Originally one of two Indians selected to join the Queen’s household, Karim rose from being a humble waiter to become Victoria’s most intimate confidant.

Arriving at court in 1887, aged 24, he introduced her to the delights of Indian cuisine, fed her romantic visions of India, and became her ‘Munshi’ or teacher, giving Victoria daily lessons in Hindustani.

Queen Victoria was 68 and had never recovered from the loss of her husband Prince Albert 26 years earlier. Her only other close male confidant, her servant John Brown, had died in 1883.

The lonely Monarch showered Karim with honours and promoted him over courtiers whose families had served the Royal Family for generations, sparking jealousy.

And their Hindi translation exercise books betray a flirtatious relationship.

Lucy Worsley, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces, said: ‘He wrote things like, “The Queen will miss the Munshi very much. Translate. Hold me tight. Translate.” It does seem quite personal and intimate.’

Victoria’s indiscreet affection caused consternation in the Royal household, led by the Queen’s private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby and her doctor Sir James Reid, who resented the ambitious young Indian upstart who was breaching all protocol.

When her Viceroy in the sub- continent – the Earl of Elgin – failed to reciprocate after being sent a Christmas card from Karim in 1894, he was rebuked by the Queen for snubbing her favourite.

The Viceroy then sent an assistant, Fritz Ponsonby, son of the Queen’s private secretary, to look into Karim’s background in India.

He had proclaimed himself the son of an Indian army surgeon, but it emerged his father was an apothecary at the local prison, where Karim himself had been a clerk.

Sir James revealed this to the Queen, telling Karim: ‘You are an impostor. You are from a low class and never can be a gentleman.’

But Victoria was livid, stating in a memo to her private secretary: ‘To make out the Munshi is low is really outrageous.’ She then expressed a wish to bestow a knighthood on her servant and on the eve of the Diamond Jubilee, threatened to pull out of the celebrations.

After Queen Victoria's death in 1901, Karim (pictured together above) retired to India until his death in 1909

Her son Bertie, the Prince of Wales, then encouraged Dr Reid to deliver an ultimatum that: ‘There are people in high places who know Your Majesty well who say to me that the only charitable explanation that can be given is that Your Majesty is not sane, and that the time will come when, to save Your Majesty’s memory and reputation, it will be necessary for me to come forward and say so.’

The threat hit home and Queen Victoria conceded defeat. There was no knighthood for Karim, though he remained at her side throughout the celebrations.

However, when she died, in 1901, he was dismissed from court and sent back to India.

In renting out three-bedroomed Karim Cottage, Balmoral Estate advertises that ‘the property was built by Queen Victoria for Munshi Abdul Karim’.

The advert adds that the property is available throughout the year ‘with the exception of some weeks during the Royal Visit’ when it is believed it is used by courtiers and Royal protection officers.
