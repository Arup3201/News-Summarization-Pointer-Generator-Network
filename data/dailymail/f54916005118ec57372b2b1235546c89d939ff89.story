With the new Premier League season fast approaching, time is running out for managers everywhere to get their teams in order.

With that in mind, Sportsmail poses the biggest questions facing England's top clubs right now. 

LIVERPOOL

Will Brendan Rodgers make one marquee signing with the £63m from the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona?

Liverpool have missed out on Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, who has signed a new five-year contract with the Spanish giants. And Madrid could also upset Rodgers by signing another of his targets, Monaco hit-man Radamel Falcao.

Transfer: With Luis Suarez sold and Adam Lallana out injured, will Lazar Markovic be enough for Liverpool?

Rodgers, though, is not panicking. He is happy with the business done so far this summer and is more concerned with group harmony that signing one big-name player. He will hold onto some of the spare cash until the January transfer window.

Of the new arrivals, much is expected of young Serbian winger Lazar Markovic, while £23m midfielder Adam Lallana will surely be influential once he shakes off a knee injury that will keep him out for the first few weeks of the season.

Chelsea

Is Fernando Torres finally on his way out of Chelsea?

The striker was part of the full-strength squad which flew out to Turkey on Friday, but that should not be taken as a sign he has a long-term future at Stamford Bridge.

Valencia have been keen on the former Liverpool hit-man for a couple of years and now have the buying buyer of a new Singapore billionaire. Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid also want the 30-year-old Spaniard. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho undoubtedly want shut, but Torres does not feel the time is right to leave.

There have been reports of a bust-up between the pair at the end of last season, but Torres still wants to stay and fight in the hope of proving the Portuguese wrong.

Curtains: Is it time for Fernando Torres' ill-fated spell in west London to come to an end?

Manchester United

Will United get a defender good enough to return them to top four?

Louis van Gaal maybe disappointed in his failed bid to sign Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen. The 28-year-old defender has been cleared to leave Arsenal by Arsene Wenger, but will move to Barcelona instead.

On first inspection, that may seem a blow to Van Gaal’s hopes of firing United back among the Premier League’s front runners in his first seasons in charge.

But the Dutchman has been more than impressed by what he has seen of the defenders already at Old Trafford during United’s pre-season tour of America. They have responded to his change in tactics and jumped on board with his brutal new fitness regime.

Defence: After losing out on Thomas Vermaelen, will Manchester United be strong enough at the back?

And, the transfer window has not closed yet. Van Gaal may yet add Ajax full-back Daley Blind to his line-up and AS Roma centre-back Mehdi Benatia.

Will Arturo Vidal be the longest-running transfer saga never to happen?

There is every chance the midfielder will still be sitting in a barber’s chair somewhere in Italy when United kick-off the new campaign at home to Swansea.

Juventus are desperate to sell the £45m-rated midfielder to help their cash-flow problems. But United are insisting no deal is on the cards.

The Chilean had an operation on his knee before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and it is believed Louis van Gaal has fears over the 27-year-old’s long-term fitness.

If a deal was done for a player who likes his hair trimmed a least once a week, Vidal would likely become United’s most expensive signing of all time.

Limbo: Arturo Vidal's ongoing transfer saga has been a feature of Manchester United's summer

Manchester City

Will City have retained the Premier League title by the time they finally sign Eliaquim Mangala?

It’s not quite “Where’s Wally?”, but not far off. It appears City have been saying they are about to sign the Porto defender within the next 48 hours for the last 48 weeks.

It’s fast becoming a farce. And we thought those days were over at City.

The 23-year-old Frenchman visited Manchester last month to ratify the deal and the video footage of his trip was embarrassingly leaked on the club's website.

The hold-up is understood to be down to City and Porto ironing out the third party ownership of a the player.

There is no truth in reports - yet - that Manuel Pellegrini has been seen searching kit skips and looking behind lockers for the player valued at around £32m.

Champions: City are the Premier Leaguechampions, but are desperate to add Eliaquim Managala to their side

Arsenal

Will Arsene Wenger rush to sign a defensive midfielder in the final weeks of the transfer window or go with Jack Wilshire as holding player?

Wenger has denied planning to use the England midfielder in a holding role for the season ahead, but could be fast running out of options.

The Frenchman has dismissed reports linking him with a move for Real Madrid’s genuinely world-class German enforcer Sami Khedira.

And the Gunners have yet to formally submit an offer to Sporting Lisbon’s William Carvalho.

Arsenal’s move for Southampton’s Calum Chambers last week caught many by surprise and it has been suggested Wenger is considering turning the young defender into exactly the sort of midfielder he wants to fill his gap.

Tussle: Does Jack Wilshere have what it takes to play as a holding midfielder, or should Wenger spend again?

West Ham United

Will Sam Allardyce finally get his hands on another striker or two before the drama starts all over again at West Ham?

Allardyce has put bids in for four strikers, but actually only wants to sign two of them. Big Sam all over, maybe? Throw everything at it and hope something decent falls out?

Andy Carroll has been ruled out until sometime in November with an ankle injury sustained on the club’s pre-season tour of New Zealand.

The absence of the club-record signing in the front line has left Big Sam in a desperate hunt before the Hammers open with an all-London affair against Tottenham.

West Ham have agreed a £3.5m fee with Metz for 24-year-old Senegalese striker Diafra Sakho but the personal terms are an issue.

Allardyce could also set his sights on Arsenal’s versatile Costa Rican Joel Campbell and Manchester United’s likely outcast Wilfried Zaha.

Issues: Andy Carroll has been plagued by fitness problems since signing for West Ham last summer 

Southampton

Are Saints going to build a team that could avoid relegation?

After having the heart of their side ripped out by Liverpool and Manchester United, there is simply not enough time for new manager Ronald Koeman to find the six or seven players needed to fully limit the damage.

The signings of Italian target-man Grazianno Pelle and Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic are a start, but it is hard to see how any club could service such a brutal dismantling of their squad and hope to survive in the top flight.

QPR

Will Brazilian glamour-boy Ronaldinho give Rangers the edge over the other relegation contenders?

Harry Redknapp is never short of a big-name transfer target, or two. But Ronaldinho? According to reports, the 34-year-old is looking for a new club after his contract at Atletico Mineiro was terminated. It has been suggested Ronaldinho would be keen to link up with compatriot Julio Cesar at Rangers. All well and good, except the keeper is likely to be on his way if a del can be done over his wages.

Ronaldinho, apparently, sees himself playing on for another eight years. The former Barcelona legend could do a job for newly-promoted Rangers, but Redknapp is not fool enough to place Ranges’ survival hopes on his shoulders.

London bound: Could Harry Redknapp pull off another coup and snag former Barcelona star Ronaldinho?

Burnley

Will Clarets’ boss Sean Dyche finally land West Brom defender Craig Dawson in time for the inevitable relegation battle?

The Baggies have rejected a third bid from Burnley for the former England Under 21 international.

Dyche has made the 24-year-old one of his top targets as he tried to build a squad capable of staying in the Premier League, but will need to up his last offer of just over £2m.

Burnley, not surprisingly, are tipped by many to stop straight back into the Championship.

Dyche was happy a squad which romped to automatic promotion last season, but he does not appear to have done enough business this summer to keep the Clarets in the top flight. It could all go very wrong, very quickly.
