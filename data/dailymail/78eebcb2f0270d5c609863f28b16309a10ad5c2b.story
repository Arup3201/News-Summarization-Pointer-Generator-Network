The scandal surrounding FIFA over Qatar’s World Cup bid is reminiscent of the crisis that engulfed the International Olympic Committee over the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.

The IOC and its late president Juan Antonio Samaranch had long been suspected of corruption when it came to awarding the Olympics, but it was not until 1998 that allegations emerged of members taking bribes to vote in favour of Salt Lake City.

It included cash handouts and expensive gifts for some members, and the offer of US college tuition for their children.

The Salt Lake City organising committee even paid for the wife of one to have cosmetic surgery.

The controversy led to an overhaul of the IOC system and punishments were handed out for the first time with 10 members expelled and another 10 sanctioned for accepting gifts.

Now it is hoped that the storm brewing over Qatar’s bid could lead to similar change within FIFA.
