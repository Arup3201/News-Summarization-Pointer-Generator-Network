The spokesperson for the Missouri auditor's office has taken his life - just a month after his boss, Tom Schweich, took his own life amid claims he was being politically bullied.

Robert 'Spence' Jackson, 44, took a sick day on Friday and shot himself either Friday night or early Saturday, authorities said on Monday.

His body was found in his bedroom on Sunday during a well-being check around 7pm after his mother called police when she was unable to reach him. A gun was found near his body.

Police spokesman Captain Doug Shoemaker said that investigators also found a note in Jackson's apartment, but he declined to detail what it said.

His death comes weeks after his boss, Tom Schweich, shot himself dead minutes after telling a reporter he wanted to go public with allegations he was being bullied by fellow Republicans.

Shoemaker said police were aware of the political issues surrounding the deaths, but that investigators wouldn't comment 'or really entertain questions that might link Jackson to any type of political issue, whether it's perceived or real'.

Police said there was no physical evidence of a forced entry or struggle, but that an autopsy is planned for Monday and detectives are continuing to investigate the case. 

Schweich, who launched his Republican gubernatorial campaign in January and was considered a frontrunner, was targeted by state GOP Chairman John Hancock, according to his supporters.

Hancock allegedly told people that Schweich - who was Christian but had Jewish ancestry - was Jewish with the implication that it was a negative attribute in a gubernatorial campaign.

The auditor had expressed angst to friends that he believed he was the victim of 'an anti-Semitic whispering campaign'.

On February 26, he shot himself at his Clayton home just minutes after telling an Associated Press reporter about the tactics.

Schweich, 54, left behind his wife Kathleen and their two young children, Emilie and Thomas.

At his funeral days later, former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, an Episcopal priest, suggested during his eulogy that Schweich had been driven to kill himself by political bullying. 

Some Schweich supporters called on Hancock to resign or for the Republican state committee to remove him. Jackson was among those who had called for Hancock's resignation.

But a week ago, Clayton Police Detective Lt. Don Bass said Schweich left behind no suicide note and that detectives have found no evidence that he was the target of political bullying.

'I think everybody's looking for a rational reason for an irrational act ... but right now we're not finding anything,' Bass said, adding that based on 'the leads and sources that we have heard from, we have not been able to prove that there was a whispering campaign'.

Hancock has also denied the allegation and said that he has received support from the state committee to continue in his role.

After the death of his boss, Jackson continued to work as the auditor's spokesperson.

He had started working as Schweich's media director in May 2011 after holding several key Republican jobs in state government.

Loss: 44-year-old Jackson, pictured, had worked with state officials for more than a decade and was remembered by former Secretary of State Matt Blunt as 'hard-working, well-liked and quick-witted'

In the early 2000s, he was communications director for then-Secretary of State Matt Blunt, and then worked for Blunt's campaign committee in 2004 as Blunt ran for governor.

Following news of Jackson's death, Blunt released a statement about his 'hard-working, well-liked and quick-witted' friend and former colleague. 

'Melanie and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Spence Jackson who was a good friend for many years,' it read.

'Spence was a gifted communicator who dedicated his talents in public affairs to public service...He will truly be missed. We mourn his passing and offer our prayers to his family and friends.'

After working for Blunt, Jackson moved to the Missouri Department of Economic Development, where he worked for just over two years.
