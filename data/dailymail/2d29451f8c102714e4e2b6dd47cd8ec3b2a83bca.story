Warning: High court judge Sir Paul Coleridge says couples aren't getting married because they cannot afford to buy a house together as well

High property prices are deterring many couples from marriage, a leading judge has warned.

Family law High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge cited a survey that shows one in six couples do not plan to marry because they cannot afford to buy a home.

It also found that cohabiting couples were put off marriage by the cost of the wedding itself.

Instead they settle for other arrangements such as living together and are more prone to break-ups.

He said: ‘A new national survey shows three quarters of 18 to 24-year-olds, and two thirds of people cohabiting, want to get married at some point. It is clear marriage remains a popular and cherished institution.

‘But when we ask people why they have not married they come up with a range of answers: the cost of weddings, waiting to be asked, not getting round to it, not thinking it’s necessary, or the cost of housing.’

Sir Paul is the founder of the Marriage Foundation think-tank, which commissioned the research by law firm Seddons.

The study of 450 people living with partners found 16 per cent do not marry because they cannot afford a house.

Some people gave several reasons, with 40 per cent unable to pay for a wedding and 25 per cent saying marriage is unnecessary.

A conference organised by the Marriage 
Foundation will discuss a new survey which found that although most 
people want to get married, nearly one in five London couples say they 
have yet to do so because they cannot afford to buy a home.

Sir Paul added: ‘There is a real danger here. People can slide into ever greater commitments without ever making a decision to be a couple.

‘Moving in together is, according to our findings, the key transition from being seen as boyfriend and girlfriend to being seen as a couple.

‘But living together was not rated highly as a way of showing commitment.

‘Without such commitment, the build-up of constraints can lead to the breakdown of the relationship.’

Danger: Most people want to get married, but 40 per cent of couples in London are delaying because of the cost

The findings add to evidence that high property prices have a dramatic effect on family life.

The
average age of a new mother is now almost 30, with the cost of housing 
and mortgage debt thought to be key reasons why women are having 
children later. 

But he 
added: 'Too many people are forced to delay marriage while entering into
significant financial commitments and starting families and are 
ill-equipped to manage the risks this entails.

The survey commissioned by Seddons in collaboration with The Marriage Foundation found that 40 per cent of couples in the capital said they were delaying marriage because it is too expensive to proceed.

Sixteen per cent said they have yet to marry because they cannot afford to buy a home together.

Nearly six out of ten Londoners said they wanted to get married.
