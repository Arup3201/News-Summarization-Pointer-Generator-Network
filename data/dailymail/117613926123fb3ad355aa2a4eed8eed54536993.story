It was supposed to be one of the proudest moments of their lives, the chance to show the world that they were ready to take part in the Olympics.

But India's athletes had the limelight stolen from them as they filed through the Olympic stadium during the opening ceremony - by an imposter who slipped through one of the tightest security operations Britain has ever seen.

The woman looked conspicuous in a red top and turquoise trousers as she walked with the team, who were all wearing yellow turbans or saris.

London 2012 chairman Lord Coe today confirmed that she was an 'over-excited' volunteer cast member who had already taken part in the ceremony.

Odd one out: Indian officials have demanded an apology after a volunteer, wearing a red top and turquoise trousers, led athletes through the Olympic stadium

Lord Coe said: 'She was a member of the cast 
who got slightly over-excited.

'We had suspected she was probably a 
member of the cast but she clearly started in that venue and we will be 
speaking to the Indian delegation about that.

'She shouldn't have been on the parade and we will look into that... the next time we have an opening ceremony.'

Earlier, Indian officials had demanded an apology from London's Olympic organisers about the incident.

India's acting chef-de-mission Muralidharan Raja said: 'She had no business being there. It was a clear case of intrusion.

'We are taking up the issue with the organisers.

'We don't know who she is and why she was allowed to walk in. It is a shame that she was walking with our athletes.'

Asked
whether it was a security breach, Mr Raja said: 'I can't say that as 
she was in a sanitised zone, but this was bizarre. We will ask for an 
apology.

'She embarrassed us in front of the world. The Indian contingent was shown (on television) for just 10 seconds, and to think this lady hogged all the limelight.'

Mr Raja, asked if he believed the woman was an Indian, said: 'She could be Asian, Latin American, I don't know.'

India has fielded its largest Olympic contingent of 81 athletes with hopes of bettering its Beijing Games tally of one gold and two bronze medals.

The athletes were among competitors from 204 countries who walked through the stadium during Friday night's spectacular ceremony, which was watched by a global television audience of more than 1billion.
