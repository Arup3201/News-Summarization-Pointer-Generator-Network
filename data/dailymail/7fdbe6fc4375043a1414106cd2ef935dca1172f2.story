The U.S. consulate in Libya was attacked twice in the months leading up to the deadly attack that claimed the lives of four Americans, it was revealed today.

The militants responsible for the bombings were also active on social networks, and used Facebook to issue
additional threats - including some against Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador who was killed in the strike.

The information is likely to increase pressure on the Obama administration as it suggests little was done to secure the facility despite the fact that it was a prime terror target.

Deadly attack: The consulate, located in the city of Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks

The consulate, located in the city of
Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the 
attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 
terror attacks.

The Daily Beast reported that various whistleblowers have come forward since the attack to testify about prior attacks and a series of threats, which are described in a letter from Rep Darrel Issa and Rep Jason Chaffetz to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The letter, obtained by the site, says that both the consulate and Stevens were prime terror targets because threats had been made against both on Facebook.

One such post mentioned the route that Stevens took on his morning jog, prompting the diplomat to briefly stop running for his own safety.

The letter also mentions two separate 
bombings on the consulate - one on April 6 (when two former security 
guards hurled improvised explosives at the building) and another on June
6.

Neither attack resulted in deaths or injuries.

The revelations came as the White House announced it was pulling all U.S. personnel out of Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city.

Officials initially claimed that attack was a protest gone wrong, despite clues that it was a planned terrorist act

White House admitted last week that it knew the attack was terrorism, despite first statements on Benghazi assault

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told The Washington Post: 'Everybody who was in Benghazi and posted there has been withdrawn.'

Yesterday, new evidence suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was involved in the attack, despite initial claims by officials that it was a protest gone wrong.

Stevens and three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods and Glen Doherty - perished in the assault.

Confusion over what sparked the Benghazi violence may have stemmed from the CIA, which distributed 'talking points' to top officials on September 14.

The unclassified documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, said in part: 'The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex.'

'There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.'

Likely working off the CIA document, 
government officials like UN Ambassador Susan Rice and White House Press
Secretary Jay Carney, said there was little evidence the violence was 
planned.

However, the document went on to say that the 'assessment may change as additional information is collected' and that the investigation is 'on-going.'

Additionally, The Daily Beast reported that an intercepted phone call between a local militia group and al-Qaeda's north Africa arm, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), indicated that the two factions worked and planned the attack together.

On Saturday, the Obama 
administration admitted that it knew within 24 hours that the strike 
was a pre-planned terrorist attack and not by crazed protestors enraged 
by an anti-Islam film.

Senior U.S. officials have now 
confessed the government privately labelled the attack a terrorist act 
almost immediately after it happened, and even knew that the 
perpetrators had links to al-Qaeda.

Shawn Turner, a spokesman for 
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, said that as U.S. 
intelligence subsequently learned more about the attack, 'we revised our
initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a 
deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.'

Turner said it remained 'unclear' if 
any individual or specific group commanded the attack. U.S. agencies 
nonetheless believe that some of the militants involved in the attack 
were 'linked to groups affiliated with, or sympathetic to al-Qaeda.'

Rep Peter King, a senior Republican from New York, demanded last week that Rice resign over her statement that the Benghazi attack was not premeditated.

Connection: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said last week that there was an explicit link between al-Qaeda and the September 11 attack on the consulate in Benghazi

The State Department rejected King's call this afternoon, defending Rice and saying she has done 'a superb job.'

Last week, Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton admitted there was an explicit link between the al-Qaeda network
in North Africa and the deadly attacks that killed Ambassador Stevens as well as information management officer Sean
Smith and security personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty..

Speaking at a Security Council 
meeting at the United Nations, Mrs Clinton said an Algerian-founded 
branch of the al-Qaeda network was situated in the area, using their 
location to plan and execute attacks, like the one in Benghazi on 
September 11.
