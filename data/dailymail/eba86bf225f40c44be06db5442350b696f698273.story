The UK economy is being given a much-needed boost - and it's thanks to Middle Eastern visitors who are splashing out on hotel rooms.

Middle Eastern visitors are forking out an average 61 per cent more per night for hotel rooms in the UK than the average national rate of £105.

Travellers from the region paid an average £169 per night on accommodation in the first half of 2014, making them the highest paying visitors to the UK, even though this rate reflected a six per cent fall from the £180 paid in the same period in 2013.

While Middle Eastern tourists were certainly well ahead of the pack, other nations also paid significantly more than the average national rate. 

Mexico came second in the list of top international spenders, shelling out an average £146 per night after a four per cent increase. Brazil was not far behind on £141, showing no change on the average price paid last year.

The most generous Europeans were the Russians, who came in fourth place at £140 per night after a 13 per cent increase.

The report from Hotels.com showed that hotel prices paid by international visitors were on the rise in 2014 compared with 2013, with 32 of the 36 nations analysed paying more in the first six months of the year than in the same time period the previous year.

The average spend of tourists from abroad and what their spend was in 2013 compared with this year 

As well as Russia, Taiwan and Spain also experienced the highest percentage increase in the table with a 13 per cent price rise, taking their average price paid to £117 and £111 respectively.

Along with the Middle East, the only others to fall were Australia, down two per cent to £115, while China and Hong Kong both dropped one per cent to £133 and £122, respectively.

Lizann Peppard from Hotels.com said: 'The UK's internationally central location, rich heritage and beautiful landscapes seem to bring out the urge to splurge in international visitors. 

'Middle Eastern visitors have the most expensive tastes when visiting the UK, ahead of Latin American, European and Asian visitors. The overall price rise and continued high spending from international visitors is good news for the UK hotel industry.'
