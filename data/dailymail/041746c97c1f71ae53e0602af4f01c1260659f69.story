Forget dating websites or being set up by friends, a woman has revealed she met the love of her life thanks to her Playstation - that was bought for her by her cheating ex.

Kelly Murray, 22,  from Lochgelly, Fife, was devastated when her long term partner confessed he had been unfaithful so she ended their relationship.

In an attempt to win back her forgiveness, he bought her the games console. But while she accepted the gift, Kelly couldn't trust him again and found solace in playing Call of Duty as she adjusted to single life.

Love game: Kelly met Paul thanks to playing Call of Duty and they are now engaged with a son

And while the game involving warfare may not sound very romantic, it led Kelly to meet a new man.

As her expertise on the game grew, she found herself chatting with other players online including mechanic Paul Abbey, 24, who called her a 'show off' after she thrashed him in one online head-to-head cyber battle.

Kelly explained: 'I was heartbroken when my 
long term boyfriend told me he had cheated on me. He moved out taking 
his Playstation with him but came round a few days later with a 
replacement as a present and asked me to take him back.

'While we had lived together, he had 
always been playing the Playstation and it really drove me crazy.

'But
 when I started to get into it I realised I was actually quite good. When I got a message from a player calling me a show off it made me 
laugh and we started talking.'

Kelly and Paul agreed to meet in person in October 2010 and love quickly blossomed between the pair. They were engaged four months later and are now the proud parents of eight-month-old son Owen.

'Everything moved really quickly with Paul and pretty quickly we were moving in together.' Kelly said. 'Then we got engaged and had our little boy Owen. We really couldn't be happier and guess I have the Playstation to thank for that.'

Call centre worker Kelly and Paul are now planning to tie the knot next year and hope to include a Playstation theme in their wedding.

Not very romantic: Call of Duty is a game of warfare. Kelly met Paul when they linked up to play one another online

Kelly said: 'It really has been such a fairy-tale for us. Maybe because we met in a fantasy world but it became a reality for us.

'We are both really excited about getting married. And you never know, we may just throw a little Playstation tribute in there.'

Paul added: 'I did think Kelly was a show off the first time I was playing against her and she won but I'm glad I told her so. Things have worked out great for us and we are both very happy.'
