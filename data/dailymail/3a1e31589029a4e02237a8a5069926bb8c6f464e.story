Promoter Eddie Hearn hopes to stage James DeGale rematch with George Groves next spring.

The British super middleweights have been bitter rivals since their amateur days and Groves won their first fight three years ago.

Both are mandatory challengers for separate world titles but Hearn hopes to convince them to put those dreams on hold.

DeGale is next in line to face Carl Froch for his IBF belt and the champion must decide whether to face his challenger by December 31.

Froch is more likely to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas in March.

Groves, meanwhile, hopes to secure a fight against WBC champion Anthony Dirrell in the new year.

But Hearn told Sportsmail: 'I'm looking to make James DeGale against George Groves in the spring.

'That's the fight that makes sense for everyone and if we can manouvere that into the IBF or WBA title, whey wouldn't you?

George Groves started slowly against Denis Douglin but eventually stopped the game American

'It pays them four or five times the money. It's only the egos and the hate between them that will stop it happen.

'Maybe the winner can fight Froch if he comes through against Chavez.'

DeGale looked impressive when stopping Marco Antonio Periban in Liverpool last month.

On the same card, Groves overcame a sluggish start to beat Denis Douglin.

At the weigh-in the day before, DeGale and Groves had to be pulled apart after a heated exchange of words.
