Asked to appraise the influence Martin O’Neill has had on his career, Shaun Maloney finds it difficult to express sufficient gratitude.

From being handed a Celtic debut at Ibrox aged just 18 to the later chance of English Premier League football with Aston Villa, O’Neill has provided so much impetus for the Scotland midfielder.

That genuinely-felt debt will not, however, prevent Maloney from trying to give his former manager a very unhappy return to Parkhead next month.

Shaun Maloney celebrates his equaliser for Scotland against Poland in Warsaw on Tuesday night

O’Neill’s Republic of Ireland side will travel to Glasgow in buoyant mood after securing a last-gasp 1-1 draw with world champions Germany on Tuesday night.

This next encounter now promises to be a vital staging post for the Euro 2016 hopes of both nations, with Maloney eagerly anticipating his reunion with O’Neill.

The Wigan man continued his fine form for Scotland by netting the opening goal for Gordon Strachan’s side in their 2-2 draw with Poland in Warsaw.

Like O’Neill, Strachan has been hugely significant in Maloney’s career, drawing arguably his most consistent form during their time together at Celtic.

‘I think I just understand what a good manager Martin O’Neill is,’ said Maloney. ‘It is no surprise to me that he has got Ireland playing the way they are. He is a superb man-manager, he really is.

‘Listen, a lot better players than me have spoken highly of Martin O’Neill so that underlines what he is about.

‘I think I am indebted to him for giving me an opportunity in the professional game, when he really didn’t have to. Particularly at that stage in my career. I was only 18 and wasn’t really a regular in the reserve side at Celtic or anything like that.

‘To be honest, it’s probably similar to the view I have of the Scotland manager just now. I don’t think I can put into words how thankful I am. But, obviously, I am hopeful that Martin doesn’t have a positive result next month.

‘That is the game. He will be trying to win and his assistant manager Roy Keane was a superb player who I was fortunate enough to play 12 or 13 games alongside at Celtic. They will be trying to win every bit as much as we will.

‘It is a really mouth-watering game coming up but you could also say the same about the matches against Georgia and Poland that we have just had.

‘Every player has tough times in their career, whether it is long-term injuries or whatever. But nights like these – and hopefully more to come – make everything worthwhile.’

Hampden’s decommissioning from use in the Commonwealth Games has taken Scotland on the road at the end of 2014. Having seen off the Georgians at Ibrox, Maloney has his sights on maintaining a 100 per cent home record in Glasgow’s east end.

‘Playing Ireland at Celtic Park is going to be an amazing occasion for everyone involved,’ he admitted.

‘The atmosphere in the stadium in Warsaw was fantastic, too. When they got their equaliser, the place was really rocking for the last 10 minutes.

‘I’m looking forward to a similar atmosphere for the team at Celtic Park. It should be fantastic.

‘I’m not sure if Ireland’s result against Germany changes anything in my eyes. I always knew they were a good side.

‘What it probably does is strengthen the idea of just how important this next match will be.

‘At the Georgia game, I spoke about how I believe the home games will be really important. But then after the way we played in Poland, I now think we can get more points away from home than maybe I first thought.’

Maloney placed a low shot into the net for a first-half equaliser against the Poles. It was a goal of superb construction, with Steven Fletcher and Ikechi Anya both heavily involved.

‘The only thing I remember about it was Anya’s cutback but I think that was the kind of goal we have been trying to aim for in the team,’ added Maloney. ‘We had some similar moves against Georgia without managing to finish them so it was good to get a team goal like that at an important moment in the match.’

Maloney is not the only Scotland player with experience of playing under O’Neill. Goalkeeper David Marshall famously performed heroics for Celtic when pitched into action against Barcelona as a 19-year-old. A decade on, he now hopes to throw up the shutters once again to frustrate his old boss.

‘It’s going to be a huge game,’ admitted Marshall. ‘We were expected to beat Georgia but it was a hard game. Now this Ireland match will be a big one in terms of the group.

‘Ireland got a late point against Germany but there’s nothing we can do about that. We can only control our own destiny.

‘We’ve been happy with the performances but we are a bit disappointed in the points return. Hopefully we can now get back to Scotland and have a couple of home games where we can get maximum points.

‘I’m sure both Gordon Strachan and Martin O’Neill are looking forward to this next game.

‘It will get everyone excited, with both of them going back to Celtic Park. I’m sure it will be a great atmosphere and I just hope it turns out all right for us.

‘Ireland have had a good start and Poland have had a great result against Germany, so it makes the home games that much more important for us.’
