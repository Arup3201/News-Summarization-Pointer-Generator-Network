The Sheriff leading the investigation 
into the cinema shooting which happened after a row over texting has 
told MailOnline there is no chance of a Stand Your Ground defence, 
saying, ‘It was an empty movie theatre. If he was scared why didn’t he 
move seats?’.

Sheriff Chris 
Nocco has completely dismissed shooter Curtis Reeves’ claims that he 
gunned down Chad Oulson because he feared for his safety and said there 
is no way he can use Florida’s controversial self-defence law.

He
 is convinced the retired cop, 71, simply lost his temper after married 
father-of-one Oulson refused to stop texting and then threw a bag of 
popcorn at his killer’s face.

Dismissed: Sheriff Chris Nocco doesn't buy Curtis Reeves' claim that he shot Chad Oulson in self defense

Charges: Reeves, wearing a green 'suicide smock' appears via video link at a hearing on Tuesday

Dedicated: Chad, pictured with wife Nicole and Lexy, two, was texting about the health of his daughter when he was shot dead. A source told MailOnline: 'Although she was only very slightly unwell, he was concerned to know how she was feeling'

Reeves’ attorney Richard Escobar 
suggested on Wednesday that his client was not hit with popcorn and was 
actually attacked with another more dangerous 'dark object'.

However
 Sheriff Nocco has completely dismissed that idea, saying nothing else 
was thrown and that Monday’s shooting is an open and shut case.

Speaking
 to MailOnline the Pasco County Sheriff said: ‘Stand Your Ground is a 
hot topic in Florida. Even if you have a clear Stand Your Ground case 
then you still have to work incredibly hard to prove that is valid.

‘So
 from our perspective, if we think it is going to be used as a defense 
we have to prove why it’s not relevant. We immediately brought in our 
states attorney’s office to work with us after Monday’s shooting.

‘I
 remember very clearly that we stood outside the movie theatre, got all 
the detectives over and said, "what do we think we’ve got here? Is this a
 Stand Your Ground case?" Everyone said, no way, this is not Stand Your 
Ground.

‘One of the key
 elements is that the theater was not packed so there was ample 
opportunity for anybody to move their seat if they wanted to.

‘From our investigation it seems simply that the agitation of someone using their cell phone to text has caused this. All the evidence and witness statements we have point that way.

‘The
 suspect was sitting there, they had an argument about texting, the 
victim turned around, threw something, a shot is fired and the next 
thing you know a man is dead.’

Another shot? Nocco said Reeves may have been planning to shoot again but his gun was jammed. But added that it is not relevant to the investigation

Former Tampa Bay police captain Reeves was in the Wesley Chapel theater with his wife Vivian watching ‘Lone Survivor’ when he asked Oulson to stop using his phone.

Oulson,
 43 – who was with his wife Nicole – was texting the babysitter looking 
after his two-year-old daughter Lexy and he refused to stop.

Reeves
 went out to get a manager, came back alone and continued the row. Nocco
 explained: ‘We believe the manager didn’t have a full conversation with
 the individual because he was dealing with other customers.

‘But the fact the suspect had the ability to go and see the manager, shows he had the ability to move his seat.’

Soon after the row restarted, Oulson threw a bag of popcorn in Reeves face and the older man drew a pistol from his pocket.

Nicole
 Oulson desperately tried to shield her husband, but Reeves fired his 
weapon and the bullet passed through her outstretched hand and hit 
Oulson in the chest.

Reeves
 then placed the gun on his thigh and calmly sat down, before being 
restrained by an off-duty deputy. His gun was jammed when it was 
recovered and investigators are not sure whether he tried to fire a 
second time.

Sheriff Nocco said: ‘After he shot his weapon he put it down. It was jammed when he put it down on his thigh.

‘I
 can’t tell you if he was trying to shoot again, or what he was doing. 
We will look at the gun to see what happened In the future, but that 
isn’t relevant to the second degree murder charge at present.’

Today
 Richard Escobar was quoted as saying something more than popcorn was 
thrown. He told The Tampa Bay Times: ‘If it was popcorn, don't you think
 the detective would have written popcorn? It's an unknown object, dark 
in color. Those facts will come out.’

But Nocco hit back: ‘There is absolutely nothing to prove anything else was thrown.’

Since
 the shooting a couple, Jamira and Michael Dixon have said they had a 
run in with Reeves in the same cinema back in December after they used 
their cell phone.

Senseless killing: Nicole Oulson was shot in the hand and Chad Oulson shot fatally in the chest

Sheriff Nocco says they are looking into the claims and they could help the case against father-of-two Reeves.

He
 said: ‘Other people are now saying this happened to them. We are 
currently trying to verify those statements, using credit card 
statements to make sure they were definitely at the movies when they 
said they were. If we can verify that then it gives us even more to go 
on.’

Devastated Nicole 
was released from hospital on Monday evening. She had surgery on her 
hand on Wednesday and has now returned to the family home in Land O 
Lakes. Over the past few days a steady stream of relatives have arrived 
at the property to look after her and Lexy.

The
 family has said very little since the tragedy, but Chad Oulson’s sister
 Kip Hoosier did talk to The Quincy Herald Whig, based in her home state
 of Illinois, earlier this week.

Describing her brother, she said: ‘He loved to have fun. He was a joker, a kidder. He smiled and laughed all the time.

‘He
 works in a motorcycle shop. He was an avid motorcycle rider, a dirtbike
 rider, but he gave that up when his wife got pregnant with their baby 
to be a father and not be so daring with his life.’

Describing
 the terrible moment Nicole broke the news to Chad’s mother, Kip said: 
‘It happened at 1 p.m. Nicole was on the phone with my mom before a 
quarter after. She wasn’t at the hospital. She was still at the theater.

‘It was completely senseless, just a sad situation. We haven’t even dealt with the reality of it yet.’

Her brother’s killer is currently being held in Land O’ Lakes jail after he was denied bail at a court hearing on Tuesday.

He
 appeared before Circuit Judge Lynn Tepper in Pasco County via video 
conference, standing at a podium wearing an olive-colored padded vest 
and handcuffs.

Richard Escobar told the court that 
Reeves has close ties to the community, posed no danger to residents and
 was no threat to flee.

Later, outside the courtroom, Escobar told reporters his client was 'heartbroken' that a life was lost in the shooting.

Reeves
 served in the Navy and the Navy Reserves before joining the Tampa 
Police Department in 1966, where he was a commander for around 17 years.
 He also worked as a homicide detective, property crimes detective and 
instructor.

He retired 
in 1993 as captain. Tampa police told CNN that he was instrumental in 
establishing the department's first Tactical Response Team - also known 
as SWAT.

Throughout his career, he consistently received good evaluations, praising his work ethic and leadership.

A
 1992 evaluation states: 'Capt. Reeves is highly adept at recognizing 
potential problems and utilizing available information to achieve 
positive results. He is frequently called upon to develop and implement 
department-wide programs concerning firearms and civil disorder.'

He
 also worked on several high-profile security details, including those 
of presidential candidate Ross Perot, Vice President Dan Quayle, 
President Ronald Reagan, Vice President George H.W. Bush and Bill 
Clinton.

He was rarely 
criticized, but in 1971, his supervisors said he needed to make a 'marked improvement' after he demonstrated a 'get-by attitude'.

Tragedy: Police tape surrounds the Cobb Grove 16 movie theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida, January 13 after the shooting over text messaging

Suspected Florida movie theater shooter Curtis Reeves was led away in handcuffs wearing a white jumpsuit after police removed his clothing for evidence. A 911 call released today revealed he had watched as his alleged victim died from a gunshot wound

Heated argument: The former cop and the victim argued before Reeves shot Oulson in the chest, killing him

In 1979 an evaluation cited problems with his temperament. It stated: 'His demeanor is generally very professional.

He has, however, occasionally allowed his temper to detrimentally affect his manner of dealing with his supervisors.'

Following
 his retirement, he served as director of security for Busch Gardens 
Tampa until 2005. WFLA has reported that the keen hunter served as 
president of the Hernando County Crime Stoppers program from 2006 to 
2007. He has been married to his wife, Vivian, since 1967 and as well as
 son Matthew, they have a daughter called Jennifer and one grandchild.

Chad’s
 former colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to 
raise money for Nicole and Lexy.

Worry: A family friend told MailOnline: 'If he had been given any indication that she needed to be picked up early then he would have left the movie theater immediately. That is why he had his phone out and presumably why he didn¿t want to put it away'
