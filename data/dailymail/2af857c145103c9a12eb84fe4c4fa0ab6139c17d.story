Heath Bowden (pictured) has been accused of biting off a man's ear and nose

A 45-year-old man told another man he was going to eat him before almost biting off his nose and leaving it hanging by a thread, a jury heard.

Heath Bowden then took a ‘chunk’ out of his victim Graham Brook’s right ear before sinking his teeth into his left ear, Gloucester crown court was told.

Julian Kesner, prosecuting, said: ‘Having bitten through [Mr Brook's] nose, he bit a large chunk out of his right ear and then started on the left ear when he was pulled away.’

Mr Bowden of Norbury Ave, Matson, Gloucester, has pleaded not guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on his victim, Graham Brook, in February 2012.

He claims he acted in self defence.

Mr Kesner, said that ‘he had lost his temper totally as a result of an argument inside the pub.'

He added: ‘We say the attack was so ferocious that whoever started the fighting the defendant was not defending himself when he bit Mr Brook.’

The incident occurred outside the Pelican pub in St Mary’s Street, behind Gloucester Cathedral.

Mr Brook and a friend had gone there for a drink in the early evening.

Mr Bowden was one of a few other customers already in the pub, Mr Kesner said.

According to Mr Brook, he was being abusive to other customers.

Mr Brook, who was previously a pub landlord, tried to usher him out of the pub to avoid him causing further trouble.

When he gave evidence, Mr Brook said Mr Bowden swore at him.

He told the jury: ‘Obviously I was not impressed with being spoken to in that manner. I believe also that the landlady was not keen to serve him anymore.

‘I tried to politely, in a professional manner, ask the gentleman to leave the public house.

The fight between the two men started in the Old Pelican pub (pictured) in Gloucester

‘I said if he did then probably the landlady would not bar him. But he started using bad language again and then took a swing at me which caught my jaw.’

A fight broke out in the pub and carried on outside.

The defendant walked away followed by Mr Brook who was concerned that he would come back to cause more trouble.

After seeing the defendant leave, Mr Brook turned back to go back inside the pub.

With his back turned, the defendant ran up behind him and knocked him to the ground, landing on top of him.

Mr Brook said: ‘He jumped on me and pinned me down on the road with his knees on my hands.

‘He said, “Right, I’m going to f***ing eat you, you bast*rd.”

‘The first thing he did was chew the end of my nose off. He bit into it. He got the nose between his teeth and just kept biting and biting and biting until the nose came off, basically.

‘It was hanging into my mouth.’’

The trial is taking place at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured). Mr Bowden has denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent

Mr Brook continued: ‘He then bit my right ear. He kept pulling my head backwards and forwards off the road with my ear in his mouth until eventually my ear came off.

‘The pain was horrendous.

‘I was screaming “get this man off me, get this man off me.” I was covered in blood.

After biting chunks out of his face, Mr Bowden was dragged off Mr Brook saying ‘that was nice’.

The jury saw photographs of Mr Brook’s injuries which prosecutor Mr Kesner labelled ‘rather unpleasant’.

They then heard that when Mr Bowden was arrested he walked past Mr Brook and said: ‘You smashed my f***ing face in.’

Mr Bowden added to police: ‘They attacked me and they got beaten up. All I did was bite the first person that came along.’

When police charged Mr Bowden with the assault he said: ‘I think I need help.’

The trial continues.
