Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is strongly hinting at a White House run. 

The union-busting Republican governor, known nationally for his triumph in a 2012 recall election, is making the rounds in early primary states and on Tuesday evening launched a political committee.

'I don’t think it’s ever been good to bet against me,' Walker said last night of a possible presidential campaign while on Sean Hannity's Fox News program. 'I wouldn’t be betting against me in a race like this, either.'

Recently inaugurated to a second term, Walker overcame the odds in November and won his third statewide election since 2010.

Less than one year into his first term Walker was confronted with a recall election by critics of a bill he helped push through the Wisconsin legislature that sharply cut back on collective bargaining rights for unionized workers and increased the amount of money that state and local government employees were expected to contribute to their pensions.

After a court battle that landed the law in Wisconsin's highest court, Republicans in the state emerged victorious. The kerfuffle sparked backlash against Walker and in November of 2011 his opponents began the effort to get him removed from office along with his Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch.

The duo made history on June 5, 2012, when they won the challenge with a larger share of the vote than they did in their initial election. Walker is the first and only governor to have survived a recall in U.S. history.

The 47-year-old Republican politician was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to a Baptist minister and a bookkeeper. His family relocated to Wisconsin when he was 10.

Walker attended Marquette University but left before he obtained a degree and joined the staff of the American Red Cross. 

He began his career in Wisconsin politics in 1990 with a campaign for the state assembly. He lost that race but won a special election in another district three years later. 

That same year he married his wife, Tonette. The couple has two sons together, Matt and Alex. The teenagers take classes at Marquette University and University of Wisconsin-Madison, respectively.

The elder Walker served in the Wisconsin State Assembly nearly a decade before running for and winning a seat on Milwaukee County's executive committee, a role he stayed in until being promoted to governor.

Walker's first attempt at the governor's mansion ended with him dropping out of the race early because he was unable to raise enough money to support the bid. 

Four years later, in 2010, he and Kleefisch were elected to the state's top two posts - positions they have held ever since. 

Long considered a dark horse candidate for president, Walker's stock went up in November after he cemented his reelection in Wisconsin.

While he has not specifically stated his intentions to compete for the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. he's made at least one high-profile political hire in the last few weeks that would otherwise seem odd given that he's only just begun his second term as governor. 

Nothing in Wisconsin law would prevent Walker from seeking an unlimited amount of terms, however, should he show interest in staying on in 2019.

Walker recently brought on former Republican National Committee political director Rick Wiley to run his newly founded Our American Revival political committee, which is legally considered a 527. 

The tax-exempt group can raise unlimited amounts of money for Walker's national travel as long as he's not officially a candidate any office. 

It cannot share its money with candidates or candidates' political action committees, though. Meaning, if Walker were to run for president, the money in that fund could not be transferred to his campaign - or anyone else's campaign, for that matter.

The organization can advocate on behalf of the policies that Walker has spent his career defending, though, one of the governor's aides told the Washington Post, and that's the role it will take on if Walker enters the 2016 competition.

'Our American Revival encompasses the shared values that make our country great: limiting the powers of the federal government to those defined in the Constitution while creating a leaner, more efficient, more effective and more accountable government to the American people,' Walker said in a statement announcing the political group.

In his Saturday speech at the Freedom Summit, Walker promised Iowa voters that he would return to the state 'many more times in the future.' Last night he said on Hannity that he planned to visit Iowa and two other important primary states - New Hampshire and South Carolina - in the coming weeks

If the purpose of the group wasn't clear already - to serve as a launching pad for Walker's national aspirations - a video released by Our American Revival on Tuesday night with its website launch answered that very question.

'America stands on the brink,'a male narrator with a quintessential campaign ad voice states.

'At a time and place in our history where failed leaders preside over a nation adrift, with family incomes in steady decline, dreams stifled, and a foreign policy that apologize for America, an dprojects weakness abroad, America can't stop this by looking to the past, or for answers in Washington, D.C.'

Throughout his speech, pictures of Barack Obama and and presumed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton flash on the screen. The first shows Obama talking to current Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice.

Another depicts Obama bowing to Japanese emperor Akihito.

Shifting to photos of Walker, the narrator says, 'To reclaim our destiny, we must turn to bold, fresh and new ideas from those incubators of reform - the states.'

'Those groups in Washington, they tend to measure success by how many people are dependent on the government, ' Walker can be heard saying in a speech to roars from the crowd as a photo of Obama and former Secretary of State Clinton standing side by side at an event appears.

'We measure success by how many people are no longer dependent on the government,' he concludes.

The not-so-subtle implication is evident: Clinton would continue the foreign policies of her predecessor, Obama.

Not previously considered they type of fiery speaker that riles up conservatives, Walker has made significant strides in that direction throughout the past year. A speech he gave over the weekend at Iowa Congressman Steve King's first-ever Freedom Summit had attendees leaving with a new perspective on his probable presidential campaign.

Walker was widely panned by media attendees as the breakout speaker of the event. The event's host, the uber conservative Rep. King, agreed. 

Basically, the press reports I read were mostly accurate in their analysis,' King told Bloomberg Politics.

'Probably the person who helped himself the most would be Scott Walker,' King said. 'The bar wasn't as high, and he gave a good speech. He connected with the audience in a good, constructive way.'

Walker repeated some of his favorite lines to the audience, several of which were also featured in his Our American Revival video, including the claim about government dependency, and promised Iowa voters that he would return to the state 'many more times in the future.' 

Last night on Hannity's program he confirmed that he'd be back in early primary state Iowa soon, as well as first in the nation state New Hampshire and South Carolina, another state with a race-making - or breaking - primary.

'My budget [will] come out next Tuesday — for the fifth and sixth year in a row I’ll lower property taxes,' Walker said on Hannity, according to the Washington Times. 

'I want a few months to get that job done,' he said, 'but I’m going to be in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and back in Iowa and we’re going to be talking about these issues for the next several months, [because] we’re excited about where we can take this country.'
