A terrifying Tim Burton marionette flown drones could someday replace the fireworks and floats at Disney World.

This is according to three drone-related patents filed by the company that could pave the way for larger-than-life puppets flying through the sky.

The first describes an aerial display system, with drones choreographed to form displays of floating pixels, similar to fireworks.

The second uses drones to fly and position flexible projection screens on which light could be reflected above a crowd.

A final patent suggests using drones to move the legs and arms of 'blimp-sized' Disney string puppets.

Disney joins a list of companies pressing for the US government to allow commercial use of small unmanned flight systems long associated with military and government surveillance.

The Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of drafting rules for the commercial use of drones for everything from TV news coverage to package delivery to crop monitoring.

The drones would be pre-programmed and controlled from the ground and would monitor each other to remain synchronised and prevent aerial collisions in the event of wind gusts, the company said.

In the case of marionettes, a drone could carry a  character through the sky to simulate flight depicted in passages from books and films, according to the patent application. 

'This is a significant improvement over prior flying characters, which typically were provided in the form of parade or other blimps/balloons filled with hot air or other gases and that had little and/or awkward articulation of any movable parts,' the company said in its patent application.

The inventors for all three patents were listed as Clifford Wong of Burbank,  James Alexander Stark of South Pasadena and Robert Scott Trowbridge, all based in California. 

The company did not respond to a request for comment.

A New York partygoer has spoken of his shock after being hit by a drone at a hi-tech 'home of the future' party.

Publisher Stephen Kosloff tweeted shocking images from the party, organised by gadget website Gizmodo, of his blood-stained t- shirt after an out of control drone hit him in the head.

The drone, which is believed to have had technical problems, hit Kosloff in the ear and forehead.

'I am now the only person I know who was wounded by a #drone at a @Gizmodo party. #tech' he tweeted.

'A few folks had the drone on a table, and they fired it up again,' Kosloff told The Awl

'Next thing I know, WHAM!!!!!!! Right in my f**king head. The drone.'
