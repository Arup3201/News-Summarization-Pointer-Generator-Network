The UK Independence Party is on course to trigger an 'earthquake' in British politics, Nigel Farage predicted today.

Delivering a robust speech at the party's annual conference, the UKIP leader predicted his party would win hundreds of seats on local councils and top the polls in next year's European Parliament elections.

And he said UKIP would win its first seats in the House of Commons at the 2015 general election.

Defiant: UKIUP leader Nigel Farage said he had succeeded in changing the national debate on Europe, immigration on Syria

He urged the party to put the 
issue of immigration from the EU at the heart of its campaign – and use 
it  to press the Government to block the free access of migrants from 
Romania and Bulgaria, due to start at the beginning of next year.

‘That
is my challenge to them. If they ignore it we must turn the euro 
elections into the referendum that we have not been given,’ he said.

He
insisted UKIP is not against all immigration, but that ‘sheer weight
of numbers’ is putting too much strain on public services and driving 
down wages for the low-skilled.

Immigration from Bulgaria and Romania will also see crime gangs flooding in to Britain, he added.

But
he said the main parties are powerless to deal with the issue as 
clamping down on EU immigration is against Brussels rules.

He told activists that by the general election UKIP membership would have overtaken the Lib Dems to become the third largest party in the UK.

‘My ambition and my conviction is we could come first in those European elections and cause an earthquake in British politics,' he said.

‘In a funny way the council elections on that day are even more important to UKIP.

‘I think we have got every opportunity on May 22 next year to win hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of council seats right across the country.’

He sought to recast his party's image, insisting  'we firmly and fiercely oppose racism' and are the 'only party that bans former BNP members from joining'.

Out: Mr Farage said he did not just want Britain to leave the European Union, he wanted every country in Europe to leave the EU too

He declared that UKIP are the 'real Europeans', but argued: 'Britain does not need a European future, Britain needs a global future.'

He added: 'I don't just want the UK out of the European Union. I want Europe out of the European Union.'

'The other parties are attempting to move into our territory without the slightest intention of doing what we suggest.'

He predicted that Labour and the Lib Dems would join the Tories in promising an in-out referendum on Europe.

But Mr Farage vowed: 'Let's stand up collectively as a nation and say we want out country back'.

Thirsty work: Mr Farage grew increasingly hot and visibly sweaty during the speech and was swiftly handed a glass of water as soon as he finished

In advance of the speech Mr Farage had to face a string of questions about claims he was a racist as a schoolboy.

On
the eve of the UK Independence Party’s conference today, Channel Four 
News broadcast comments from teachers at Dulwich College that the 
teenage Farage was a ‘fascist’ and a ‘racist’ when a pupil at the 
private London school in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Education: Mr Farage attended Dulwich College, a private school in south-east London

A letter from 1981 claims Mr Farage, 
now 49, was even heard ‘shouting Hitler Youth songs’. The claims did not
prevent him being appointed as a prefect at the school.

The
Ukip leader last night played down the significance of the claims, 
which he said were made by left-wing teachers who disliked his views. He
denied singing Nazi songs.

Mr Farage said: ‘Yes of course I said some ridiculous things, not necessarily racist things. It depends how you define it.

‘You’ve
got to remember that ever since 1968 up until the last couple of years,
we’ve not been able in this country, intelligently to discuss 
immigration, to discuss integration, it’s all been a buried subject.’

He added: ‘Was I a difficult, bolshie 
teenager who pushed the boundaries of debate further than I should? Yes.
Have I ever been a member  of an extremist organisation? No, I have 
not.’

Mr 
Farage was backed last night by a former Dulwich College master Terry 
Walsh, who said the complaints  were ‘probably a reflection on the 
staff, not on him – there was quite a strong left-wing element’.
