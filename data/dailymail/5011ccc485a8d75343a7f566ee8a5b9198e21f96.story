Police are trying to trace a boy after a 14-year-old was held at knife-point by two thieves who demanded he give them his bottle of coke.

The victim was drinking outside in Manor Square, in Solihull, at around 7pm on 6 July when he was approached by two youths demanding he give them his soft drink.

The teenager initially refused, but handed over the bottle when the thieves produced a knife and threatened him.

Suspect: The police have released CCTV images of the teenager they are looking to speak to in connection with the incident in Solihull, West Midlands. He is described as black, about 5ft 7ins tall and aged between 14 and 15

A male teenager has already been 
arrested, but officers want to speak to another person in connection with
 what happened and have released CCTV pictures in a bid to trace him.

A West Midlands Police spokesperson said that this type of crime was 'unusual' in Solihull, which has one of the lowest crime rates in the West Midlands.

She said: 'Solihull is quite an affluent area, crime is really low there so this incident is unusual'.

There were only 88 recorded incidents of robbery recorded in Solihull over the last year.

Lorey Burt, MP for Solihull said that she was shocked to hear about the attack.

She said: 'My first thoughts are with the young man who obviously had a very frightening experience.

'As
 a former prison officer my message to the youths who did this is they 
should think very carefully before going down a path of crime.

'Solihull
 is usually a pretty safe place and I feel lucky to live here. Crime is 
falling across the West Midlands but many people feel less safe than 
ever.

Targeted: The 14-year-old boy was drinking a bottle of coke on the street in Manor Square, Solihull, pictured, when the two youths approached him. A police spokesperson described the area as 'affluent'

'We need to work on reassuring the public and cutting police 
response times.

'I will be discussing this further with local 
barrister Ayoub Khan, who is campaigning to be the next Police and Crime
 Commissioner for the West Midlands.'

Police hope that by releasing the images they will be able to find the second youth they want to speak to in connection with the incident and have urged anyone who recognises the suspect to come forward.

Detective constable Tom Finch said: 'This was a potentially nasty incident involving a knife which left the young victim very shaken.

The person shown in the CCTV images is described as black, about 5ft 7ins tall, and aged between 14 and 15.

Detective constable Finch continued: 'It is vital that we speak to this person as soon as possible - if you know him, please do the right thing and call us with the information on 101.'

Information can also be submitted anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
