It was all going jolly well for England’s cricketers in their campaign to retain the Ashes.

But that was until a virtually unknown Australian teenager named Ashton Agar – dubbed ‘Ashton Who?’ – strolled in to bat with his team nine wickets down.

And after a stunning innings in which the rookie humbled England and smashed cricketing records in the process, it was more a case of ‘Ashton Wow!’

Remarkably, 19-year-old Agar was playing league cricket for Henley just a few months ago, as a way of learning about English pitches and conditions.

Didn't see that one coming: Ashton Agar scored 98 runs as number 11 batsman - a record-breaking feat - yesterday's test match (left). A month ago he was playing for Henley Cricket Club  in Henley on Thames (right)

The experience clearly served him well yesterday as he scored 98 runs, tantalisingly short of becoming the first Number 11 batsman to score a Test century but still the highest in that position.

His partnership of 163 with Phil Hughes was the highest for a 10th wicket in Tests.

The predominantly English crowd at Trent Bridge in Nottingham gave the youngster a standing ovation as he left the pitch and even former England captain Michael Vaughan confessed that he was ‘disappointed’ when Agar was out.

And it left England, the clear favourites to keep hold of the Ashes trophy, facing something of a challenge.

And by the time he was eventually caught out, Australia were 65 runs ahead of England - and Agar had etched his name into the record books.

Australia’s delighted prime minister Kevin Rudd hailed his ‘stunning’ performance and jokingly declared an ‘Ashton Agar Day’ in honour of the nation’s newest hero.

Agar’s Sri Lankan-born mother Sonia and brothers were in the crowd at Trent Bridge, having flown from Australia to witness his debut.

Sonia leaped out of her seat in joy when she thought her son had smashed a four to reach his century - but he was caught out by an English fielder.

His father John revealed that Agar had rushed up to his family and apologised for failing to make the magical 100 runs.

‘He came over to his brothers and said sorry. That is so him. He still had a smile on his face. He often looks up to us when we’re in the stands,’ he said.

Agar had caused eyebrows to be raised simply by being picked to play in the opening Ashes Test. He had only ever previously played ten games of first class cricket in Australia.
