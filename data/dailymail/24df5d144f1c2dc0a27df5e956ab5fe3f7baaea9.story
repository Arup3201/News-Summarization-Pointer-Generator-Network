Anti-government protests in Kiev 
escalated into fiery street battles with demonstrators hurling rocks and
 firebombs to set police vehicles ablaze. Dozens of officers and 
protesters were injured.

And grenade-wielding protesters in the Ukrainian capital attacked a peace-making opposition leader with fire extinguishers as they attempted to force their way in to government headquarters.

Viltali Klitschko, leader of pro-European party UDAR and a former
 WBC heavyweight boxing champion, was blasted with chemicals
and grabbed by the collar when he weighed in to hold back the 
radicals.

Klitschko tried to persuade demonstrators
 to stop their unrest, but failed and was sprayed by a fire extinguisher
 in the process.

Mr Klitschko later travelled to President Viktor Yanukovych's residence and said the president had agreed to negotiate.

'There
 are only two ways for events to develop. The first one is not to 
negotiate,' Mr Klitschko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news 
agency. 'A scenario of force can be unpredictable and I don't rule out 
the possibility of a civil war. ... And here we are using all 
possibilities in order to prevent bloodshed.'

The
 fire extinguisher attack was the latest in a series of assaults on 
government officials made since President Viktor Yanukovych proclaimed a
 break with the EU last year.

On Sunday thousands of demonstrators descended on the parliament building to fight harsh new anti-protest laws.

A
 group of radicals used stun grenades and fire extinguishers to blast 
flames at officers in a bid to push past the row of buses blocking the 
government building.

The laws, approved by a quick show of 
hands on Thursday, are seen as an attempt to quash anti-government 
demonstrations, ongoing since November 21.

Branded 'undemocratic' by US security services, they prohibit demonstrators from wearing masks or hard hats at rallies.

They also seek to make critical reporting a crime, and restrict the activity of American-funded non-governmental groups.

The protesters arrived mockingly clad in hard hats, gas masks, and theatrical masks, chanting 'shame' and 'revolution'.

Numerous explosions were heard and plumes of smoke rose above the crowd.

Some were injured and medics were seen treating them.

The clashes occurred shortly after a 
large peaceful rally on Kiev's main square denouncing President Viktor 
Yanukovych's decision to freeze ties with the European Union and embrace
 Russia instead.

Since then, Moscow has promised a Â£9billion bailout loan to aid Ukraine's struggling economy.

Dozens of opposition leaders and journalists have been attacked, harassed and prosecuted, since the protests started two months ago.

The violent scenes are the latest in two months of anti-government demonstrations over the nation's relationship with the EU

On Thursday, Vladimir Malyshev, deputy of the pro-Russian majority, was left profusely bleeding from the forehead after a punch-up during a parliament budget meeting.

Several opposition leaders addressed the crowds from a giant stage, wearing bright construction workers' hats.

Mr Yanukovych's legislation has been denounced by his retractors as unconstitutional, with opposition leaders calling for formation of parallel governing structures in the country.

'The power in Ukraine belongs to the people,' said Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one of the several protest leaders.

Mr Yanukovych's government has ignored previous demands of the opposition.
