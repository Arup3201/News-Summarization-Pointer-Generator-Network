A mother at the centre of a tug-of-love dispute who refused to return four of her five children to their father in Spain had the threat of jail lifted from her yesterday.

Jennifer Jones went into hiding after claiming two of the children became ‘traumatised’ about a court order that they must live with their father.

She faced contempt of court charges and a possible prison sentence for failing to hand them over.

Ms Jones, 47, disappeared with her children last October on the day she was due to send them back to their army officer father in Spain.

They were all found safe and well 30 hours later 60 miles from Miss Jones' home in Llanelli, south Wales, after a High Court judge made a public appeal for help.

Miss Jones' ex-husband Tomas Palacin Cambra was granted custody of their children after the break-up of their 12-year marriage in 2008.

At a hearing in the High Court in London, the judge ruled that Miss Jones was not in contempt of court for failing to return her children immediately.

Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court, said that she didn't wilfully breach the order.

Miss Jones' lawyers said she was unable to return her children as two of them had run away to a local police station after saying they did not want to leave their mother.

Last summer the couple's four youngest children - Jessica, 14, Tomas, 12, Eva, 10, and David, eight - were staying with their mother in Wales.

The mother also has a fifth child called Sara, 17, who stayed with her father in Majorca.

But when it was time to send them back to Spain, Miss Jones put them into schools in her home town of Llanelli while she started custody proceedings.

The English teacher then went missing after the High Court ruled they should be returned to their father following an application from a Spanish court using child abduction laws under The Hague Convention.

Yesterday lawyers for the Solicitor General argued at the High Court that Miss Jones was in contempt for not upholding the order and returning her children.

Her lawyers told Sir Munby that her contempt was not 'deliberate'.

On the day she was due to hand the children over to her ex-husband two of them were so 'traumatised' that they ran to a local police station in Llanelli, Miss Jones told the court.

Her lawyers said her children's behaviour made it impossible to comply with the order.

Miss Jones said: 'I was very worried about everything.

'Those children didn't want to go back [to Spain]. It was pretty clear. All I knew was that my daughter and my son had run away and escaped.

'I was very concerned about my children. I was so frightened because I knew I was supposed to be in Cardiff. I was going through a lot of emotions.

'As a mother you go by your instincts.'

Sir James upheld these claims and dismissed the contempt of court case against her today.

After the mother and children had been found, English language teacher Miss Jones and her boyfriend John Williams, 48, a builder, were arrested and the children put in the custody of foster carers.

Colonel Cambra, 53, a Spanish army officer, flew from Majorca to the UK with their eldest daughter, Sara, 17, to collect all of the children.

They returned home with only Eva, ten, and David, eight, while Jessica, 15, and Tomas, 13, remained with their mother until the court decided their future.

During the hearing Miss Jones revealed letters by the children begging the judge not to be sent back to Spain with their father.

Colonel Cambra alleged their mother got the children to make false allegations about his treatment of them.

Issues surrounding custody of their five are still to be agreed.

Miss Jones met Colonel Cambra when he 
was a captain while she was teaching English in Tenerife. They were 
married in 1996 and lived in the Canary Islands and Ibiza but 
frequently returned to Wales to stay with Miss Jones’s family.

The family were in the process of 
building a luxury home in Catalonia in 2008 when Miss Jones and the 
children returned to Llanelli for ten months.
