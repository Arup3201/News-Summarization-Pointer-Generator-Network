Tottenham continue to admire Everton midfielder James McCarthy.

Sportsmail revealed their interest early this month but the main obstacle remains that Everton do not wish to sell.

McCarthy is recovering from a hamstring injury and is poised to return for the game against Crystal Palace but he has been sorely missed with his absence coinciding with a downturn in Everton’s form.

McCarthy has been injured, but is expected to return for the visit to Crystal Palace at the end of January 

The partnership he forms with Gareth Barry at the base of Everton’s midfield has been key to their style and that has not gone unnoticed elsewhere.

Arsenal were primed with a bid before January but realised it would take at least £25million and Tottenham have considered offering Aaron Lennon and Younes Kaboul plus money but it still may fall short.

Everton have scouted other midfielders such as Marcelo Brozovic of Dinamo Zagreb but they still want McCarthy to stay. The 24-year-old was waiting to discuss a proposed revision of his contract but will see how the season finishes before pushing for talks.
