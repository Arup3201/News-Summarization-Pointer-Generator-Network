Reality star Honey Boo Boo is set to take over the world as the beauty pageant queen and her colorful family have their show broadcast internationally, it was announced today.

Honey Boo Boo, aka Alana Thompson, has become famous in the U.S. for her TLC series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.

The popular show features the antics of the charming seven-year-old and her mom June, dad Sugar Bear, three older sisters and gay 'Uncle Poodle' at the family home in McIntyre, Georgia.

'Redneck-ognize!' Honey Boo Boo is set to be a star in Europe, Australia and Latin America after the Discovery Network syndicated her show internationally

The family has already been popular with viewers in Eastern Europe, leading the TV network to broaden the show's reach.

In the next few months, Honey Boo Boo will appear on screens in Australia, the Netherlands, Italy and Latin America.

Luis Silberwasser, executive VP at Discovery Networks International, told the New York Post: 'In Poland, where it just started airing, it’s already No. 3 in terms of viewers.

'This is a slice of Americana — not 
typical America, but of a particular family in the South, and the 
international audience knows that there are many facets to American 
lives.'

The reality show follows beauty pageant enthusiast Alana taking part in contests but also the family's life in general including one disastrous Thanksgiving dinner, quad bike rides and her sisters bobbing for pig's feet at the Redneck Games. 

However, Honey Boo Boo's unique catchphrases - including 'a dolla' makes me holla' and 'you'd better redneck-ognize' - might prove a challenge for foreign viewers.

Discovery said that it is working on ways to overcome the lingo that might be lost in translation - as the show already subtitles for English-speaking audiences. Other options include dubbing voiceovers and developing a more in-depth glossary of terms.
