Victim: Alan Smith was stabbed in a 'frenzied attack' in a diner after asking if the alleged killer's crying daughter was alright, a court heard

A father out celebrating his daughter's birthday was brutally knifed to death in front of his horrified family just because he asked if a crying child was alright, a court was told yesterday.

Alan Smith, 63, was stabbed at least five times as he sat with his partner, daughter and son-in-law in a cafe in east London.

His alleged killer, Matthew Quesada, became enraged when Mr Smith approached him in the BB Cafe to ask if his young daughter, who was crying, was okay, the jury heard.

Quesada responded 'What's it to you? What's it got to f****** do with you?' before storming out of the cafe.

'Humiliated
 and angered' by what happened and 'bent on exacting revenge' Quesada, 
then aged 25, ran to his girlfriend's home to drop off the girl and grab
 a weapon.

With
 a knife concealed up his sleeve,He then raced 
after the family as they entered a second diner - the Roma cafe - where 
they had gone to eat to avoid any further trouble.

It was there that Quesada allegedly launched a 
'frenzied and wordless' attack, stabbing Mr Smith in the head and body.

As Estelle Jenkins tried to get between her father and his 
attacker, Mr Smith struggled up from the bolted down table before 
falling to the floor where he kicked out in a vain attempt to stop the 
onslaught, the court heard.

Quesada
 only fled when the victim's son-in law Mark Jenkins threw a chair at him, 
halting the attack, as Mr Smith's horrified partner Denise Facey looked 
on, the court was told.

As Mr Smith's life ebbed away an air 
ambulance doctor had to perform emergency heart surgery on a cafe table 
that formed a 'make-shift operating table.'

He was flown to hospital where he died from his wounds, three of which were fatal.

Quesada, now 26, denies murdering Mr Smith on March 26 last year.

Roger
 Smart, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey jury Quesada accepts he stabbed
 Mr Smith and the issue will be his state of mind at the time.

The
 court heard in the lead up to the alleged murder, Mr Smith was waiting 
for his family to arrive at the BB Cafe in London's Leyton when Quesada 
entered with his crying daughter.

After a few minutes when the crying 
did not subside and while Quesada washed his daughter's hands in the 
sink, Mr Smith approached to ask if everything was alright with the 
little girl, it was claimed.

However, the father-of-two reacted 
angrily and tried to push past a waiter to get into the kitchen but was 
blocked,

He then tried to use the cafe's phone, but stormed off with his daughter after he wasn't allowed.

The Old Bailey heard that as Quesada went next door to borrow a phone Mr Smith's family arrived.

As
 Mr Smith told them they would eat elsewhere, Quesada was overheard 
saying 'I need the piece' over the phone as he stood glaring as Mr Smith
 and his family left the cafe.

As they walked off Quesada shouted out: 'You see. You? I'll see you.'

Mr
 Smart said: 'A warning. A man in an aggressive state. A man humiliated,
 angered by what had happened inside the BB Cafe, bent on exacting 
revenge.'

'Frenzied attack': Mr Smith's family tried to leap between him and alleged killer Matthew Quesada during the stabbing in Roma Cafe, the court heard

The time between the call and the murder was just four minutes, it was said.

Minutes
 later he was seen running after Mr Smith and his family as they entered
 the Roma Cafe on the Lea Bridge Road where they had gone to eat 
instead.

Mr Smart said: 'He entered only a 
minute or so after the deceased and his family had sat down in the cafe 
and approached the table at which they were all sitting.

'Mark
 Jenkins was facing the door to the cafe and noticed Quesada when he 
approached their table. Mr Jenkins saw that the defendant had hidden a 
knife inside the cuff of his sleeve.

'As he got to their table, the defendant leaned across and without uttering a word, lunged at Mr Smith.

'The defendant attacked Mr Smith in a frenzied knife attack, making a plunging motion and hitting the deceased's head and body.

'At
 this point Mr Jenkins jumped up and stepped away from the table. The 
defendant repeatedly lunged at Mr Smith across the table hitting him at 
least five to six times.

Confrontation: The court heard the attack was sparked when Mr Smith asked if the crying baby was alright as he waited to meet his family in the BB Cafe in Leyton

'Mr Smith tried to get out from the bolted down table. He managed to get to his feet and his daughter Estelle Jenkins tried to get between her father and the defendant.

'Mr Smith fell to the floor and kicked out at Quesada, trying in vain to protect himself from the attack.'

Warded off by Mr Jenkins, Quesada was spotted jumping over the back gardens from his girlfriend's flat before getting into a waiting car and speeding off.

A day later Quesada who had shaven off his distinct Afro style hair and changed his clothes was arrested along with his mother Victoria Passley-Quesada inside her car in south London.

He had on him his British passport, flight details for that day's flights to Sao Paulo in Brazil, along with a holdall.

His mother Passley-Quesada, 54, of Purley, Surrey, is accused of hiding him from the police, looking up flights, and helping him in his bid to escape.

His girlfriend Maria Brigette, 26, of Hibbard Road, Leyton, east London, is accused of updating him on the police investigation. Both deny assisting an offender.

The trial, expected to last three weeks, continues.
