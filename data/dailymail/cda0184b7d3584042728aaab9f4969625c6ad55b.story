What a stink!

Turns out more than a one-and-a-half million Americans are without indoor plumbing.

According to the latest American Community Survey, nearly 630,000 occupied households lack complete plumbing facilities.

It means that they are without one or more of the following: a toilet, a tub or shower, or running water.

Just sixty years ago a quarter of American homes had no flushing toilet.

Out house: According to a survey more than a million homes lack complete plumbing facilities, which means that they are without a toilet,  tub or shower, or running water

In the 1940s, around a thirdÂ  of homes in the U.S. had no flushing toilet. In some States, up to 70 per cent of people did not have a flushing toilet in their own home, instead most people went to use an outside toilet or privy.

On a state-by-state basis, around 80 per cent of homes in Mississippi were without a flushing toilet in 1940 but by the 1990s just 4 per cent were without a public sewer, septic tank, or cesspool.

In 1990, only 1 percent of American homes our homes lacked complete plumbing facilities. But, things were much different in 1940, when nearly half lacked complete plumbing.

Then, about ten States had rates approaching or exceeding 70 percent.

In the middle of nowhere: The places that are likely to have toilets that don't flush are in rural area and very remote

In succeeding decades, the proportion of homes lacking complete plumbing dropped dramatically, falling to about one-third in 1950 and one- sixth in 1960.

It is interesting to note the States with the lowest percentage of such homes in 1940 were higher than Alaska, which topped the 1990 list.

So who doesn't have a flushing toilet?

Counties containing Indian reservations have astonishingly high percentages of households without plumbing.

Heritage: Indian reservations are also more likely not to have proper plumbing and runing water such as Tes Nez Iah, and Apache County, Arizona

14 percent of households in Shannon County, South Dakota don't have full plumbing.

In Apache County, Arizona., the rate is more than 17 percent.

Sparsely-populated census areas in Alaska also have very high percentages.

Counties along the Rio Grande in Texas have high rates of unplumbed households.

There are also homes in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia too.

In 1990, although homes that were without plumbing numbered less than 3 per cent across the entire United States, 12 per cent of properties in Arkansas were without flushing toilets.
