Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, (pictured today) told Cardiff Crown Court that she told police and social services about Watkins' child sex crimes in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012

The ex-lover of paedophile singer Ian Watkins claims to have reported him to police five times over four years before officers believed her, a court head today.

Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, told Cardiff Crown Court that she told police and social services about Watkins' child sex crimes in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. 

But a court heard police refused to collect the phone and computer of Mjadzelics after she told them he had sent her indecent images of a 'very young girl being abused'.

The 39-year-old from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, is accused of four counts of possessing indecent images of children, two charges of distributing indecent images of children and one charge of encouraging Watkins to send her an indecent image of a child. 

She denies all charges against her. 

Mjadzelics claims that she was trying to 'trap' the Lostprophets singer on her own and get 'evidence' against him after police 'failed to act.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has three ongoing independent investigations into the response of South Wales Police, Bedfordshire Police and South Yorkshire Police to allegations that Watkins was abusing children.

Taking to the witness stand today, she told the jury she repeatedly went to the police and Watkins' family about his paedophile activities but was not believed until 2012.

Mjadzelics told the court she reported him to Pontypridd Child Services and the police child protection unit in December 2008 and gave a statement to a 'woman police constable' at West Yorkshire Police and to officers at South Wales Police in early 2009.

She said she also wrote letters to Watkins' mother warning her of her son's paedophile activities only to be questioned by police in March 2009 over 'harassment' of his family.

She said she broke contact with Watkins in 2009. 

However, she told the court they met again in a Leeds hotel in 2010 where he opened his laptop and showed her a video of a 'child crying and being raped' while Watkins had an 'evil smirk' on his face.

Mjadzelics said: 'He was looking at me for a reaction and I cried and told him to get out of the hotel room.'

She told jurors that she tried repeatedly to report the crime to police but she was 'ignored'. 

It was then, she claims, that she decided she needed to 'trap' the Lostprophets singer on her own and get 'evidence' against him.

She said: 'We contacted each other again in May 2011 and by that time I had decided it was no good crying and sending him away anymore.

'I had to basically change the game and change my reaction and play him.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard how mother-of-one Mjadzelics raised concerns with police and social services about Watkins' (pictured) child sex crimes four years before he was finally convicted of a series of offences

Mjadzelics told the court (pictured) she reported him to Pontypridd Child Services and the police child protection unit in December 2008 and gave a statement to a 'woman police constable' at West Yorkshire Police and to officers at South Wales Police in early 2009

She said the next time he contacted her he told her he had gone to Los Angeles to listen to his album, and had raped a 12-year-old girl and plied her with cocaine.

The court heard the graphic and disturbing online chats and messages sent between the pair during May 2011 in which they discuss snatching, murdering and violently sexually abusing and raping children and infants.

During the chats Watkins sent Mjadzelics four indecent images of children which she claimed she tried to get police to look at 'as soon as she was able to' in the same month.

She told jurors she told Detective Sergeant Andy Whelan at South Wales Police about the four indecent images of a 'very young girl being raped' sent by Watkins to her phone and computer.

But she said no one came to collect her phone or laptop.  

Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years in December 2013 after being convicted of a number of horrific sex crimes including the attempted rape of a baby

Mjadzelics told the court that she had been treated like 'a nut job'.

She said she first met Watkins in 2006 after going on the Lostprophets website looking for show tickets for a friend. 

She received a reply from someone called Ian who she eventually realised was Watkins and their online conversations became sexual with him inviting her to meet him at a Leeds hotel.

Mjadzelics, who was working for a private bank, said Watkins filmed their first sexual encounter and later others too.

Watkins, from Pontypridd, has since been given a 30-year sentence after pleading guilty to a series of child sex offences including the attempted rape of a baby.

Mjadzelics was arrested  in January 2013 for conspiracy to rape a baby.

Her defence barrister said she damaged her health because of the 'incompetence and indifference' of the police and child agencies she asked for help.

'She is stressed, traumatised, has suffered a stroke, has disabling migraines', Michael Wolkind QC told jurors.

Prosecutor Jim Davis said there was no dispute from Mjadzelics that she was in possession of four indecent images of children, had sent an indecent image of a child and had twice encouraged Watkins to send her an image of child rape.

But the jury heard she claimed she kept the images to trap Watkins and bring him to justice.

Mjadzelics, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, denies four charges of possessing indecent images of children, two charges of distributing indecent images of children and one charge of encouraging Watkins to send her an indecent image of a child.

The trial continues.
