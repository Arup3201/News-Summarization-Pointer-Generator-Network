Model Myla Dalbesio has hit out against the fashion industry’s 'ridiculous' treatment of sizing – and claims that she will no longer try and conform to society’s stereotypes.

The 27-year-old, who is a size 10, made headlines in November when she was chosen as the newest face of Calvin Klein’s Perfectly Fit underwear and was described in an interview with Elle.com as the first 'plus size' model to have ever worked with the brand – a label which caused outrage among critics who claimed Myla was 'too thin' to fit the larger stereotype.

But now, the model has hit back at her critics, claiming that the fashion industry places too much emphasis on 'ridiculous' labels for women according to their size.

More than a measurement: Calvin Klein model Myla Dalbesio has slammed 'ridiculous' fashion stereotypes

'We don't want there to be distinctions and precursors for everyone based on something as arbitrary as the number on the tag of our jeans. Plus size, straight size, in-betweenies. It all sounds so ridiculous,' she said in a new interview with Elle.com. 

'I want all women to know, regardless of size, shape, color, whatever, that they are powerful beings. You own your beauty; your body is what you make of it. You can, and should, celebrate it, regardless of whatever size society tells you it's supposed to be.'

She added: 'When I stopped the weird diets and essentially rejected what everyone was telling me to do with my body and my life, my whole world changed. I began to respect myself in a different way and to demand that same respect from the people around me.

'I became a whole person again, which made it easier to figure out what I wanted from life and take on the challenges involved in getting there. I am more than a measurement and I want people to know that.'

Newfound confidence: 'I began to respect myself in a different way and to demand that same respect from the people around me,' she added

Controversy: Myla's description as 'plus size' in an interview with Elle.com in November set Twitter ablaze with criticism that she wasn't large enough to be categorized as such

Myla called the attention surrounding her Calvin Klein campaign 'surreal' and 'strange'.

'When you're caught up in the middle of a media blitz, it can be terrifying and stressful,' she said.

She added that while she felt as though the attention would never end, the quick turnover of today's news cycle means that 'you basically blink and your moment is over'.

However, the upside of being thrust into the spotlight was having the opportunity to inspire other women.

Positive image: 'I want all women to know, regardless of size, shape, color, whatever, that they are powerful beings,' she said

She received emails and comments from women sharing their own stories about body image, which gave her 'a greater feeling of responsibility' with regard to her career choices.

Myla also revealed that she is an artist and is currently working on a series of collages and drawings.

'I'm always in my studio working on something when I'm not traveling,' she said.

As for her subject matter, she added: 'The powerful female body is the fundamental base of all the art I make, but size doesn't really play a role.' 

Media blitz: Myla called the attention surrounding her Calvin Klein campaign 'surreal' and 'strange'

Earlier this month, Myla told Yahoo Style that she doesn't think she is large enough to be considered 'plus-size' and admitted that she previously lied about her size and stuffed her clothes in order to secure modeling jobs aimed at bigger women.

She said that she has always felt like an 'in-betweener' in the fashion industry, with her figure too large for traditional modeling jobs, but too small for plus-size work.

'You get used to calling yourself a plus-size model when you’re not,' she said.

'It has been hard. I can never figure out where I fit in, and I'm always making someone mad. I'm not skinny-skinny, but I'm not fat and fabulous either. I'm a size 10.'
