A vicious fight between teenage girls that was caught on camera is under investigation by the Houston Police Department. 

Footage of the brawl was shared on Twitter on Sunday night. The police department learned of the scrap after a user tagged them in the video on the social networking site.

One video shows a group of girls gathered in a parking lot before one of the teenagers, who is wearing blue jeans, forces another girl to the ground and repeatedly punches her in the face.

The girl on the ground attempts to protect her face with her arms but her attacker gets several punches in before getting up and apparently stomping on the girl's face. 

Violent: Two girls can be seen fighting in a parking lot in Humble, Texas. The video of the incident was widely shared across Twitter on Sunday night and caught the attention of the Houston Police Department

Scrap: Other girls stand by and watch as the fight - just one caught on camera that day - unfold before them

After the attack, the girl remains sprawled on the floor, apparently unable to get up, and is helped to her feet by two friends, according to the video first shared byKPRC 2.

During the fight, bystanders watch and shout words of encouragement rather than alerting authorities. 

Another video also shared online shows the same girl in blue jeans in a fight with another girl, apparently at the same parking lot.

In that footage, the two girls drag each other across the parking lot by their hair as onlookers continue to shout at them. 

Two teenagers in the video told KPRC that they went to the parking lot after learning that the fight was going to be held near to an elementary school in Humble.

But Humble Independent School District said the fight did not take place on a school's campus. 

Brutal: In an even more disturbing cell phone video, the girl in blue jeans pins a different girl down and repeatedly punches her before stomping on her head

'It is unclear if those involved are students, but school district police and administrators will be viewing the video to assist investigators in identifying those involved,' it said in a statement.

The Harris County Sheriff's Department and the Houston Police Department are investigating.

They have not yet responded to comment on whether any arrests have been made or if any of the girls in the video have been identified. It is also unknown what injuries the girls sustained in the fight.

After the video was shared online, one Twitter user sent a message to the Houston Police Department tagging one of the girls but her profile has since been removed.
