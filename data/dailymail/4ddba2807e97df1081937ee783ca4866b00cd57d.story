Presenting himself as a real-life castaway, David Burgess said he had spent the last 26 years living in a driftwood shack by one of the Britain's most remote beaches.

But it has now emerged that the 63-year-old's Robinson Crusoe-style tale may not have been quite as it seemed.

According to his sister, he actually spent a lot of his time living in his mother's house before she died and now still stays with family or friends when it gets cold.

For sale: The terraced home where castaway David stayed regularly with his mother Phyllis

Simple life: The 63-year-old has lived in this remote driftwood shack in Somerset for the past 26 years

Just the basics: The shack has no electricity, with Mr Burgess doing most of his cooking over an open fire

Mr Burgess had his own room at the terraced home in Exeter, Devon, of his widowed mother Phyllis and kept clothes and other possessions there.

He has said he sleeps  on a 
mattress of dried leaves under a blue tarpaulin every night at the tumbledown remains of a 17th Century bark drying house in Embelle Wood near Porlock, Somerset.

But his sister Margaret, who stands to inherit a half-share of the £140,000 house which is up for sale, told the Sun her brother often stays with her.

She said: 'He stays at his cabin off and on and at other times stays with friends or comes here. He likes his lifestyle out in the open, but it gets very cold up there in winter. He's got lots of friends wherever he goes and stays wherever he lays his hat.'

And one of Phyllis' former neighbours added: 'David thought a lot of his mum and would come and stay with her all the time.'

Enjoying the high life: David Burgess had his first taste of champagne after leaving the remote shack he calls home for a tour of Exeter

No expense spared: During his trip to Exeter Mr Burgess sipped champagne worth over £45 a bottle

Getting to grips with his trolley: Not his usual outlet for food supplies - and, right, Mr Burgess gets his first-ever suit-fitting at Moss Bros in Exeter

Earlier this week David had a taste of the outside world - including his first ever sip of champagne.

Among the novelties he experienced in Exeter, included listening to an 'amazing' iPod, sitting in a Ferrari, having a 
suit-fitting and an 'unbelievable' visit to M&S.

The divorced father-of-one joined 
suited businessmen and smartly dressed couples, as he enjoyed an 
expensive lunch at Michelin-starred chef Michael Caines' restaurant at 
the city's plush Abode Hotel - and sipped champagne priced at £47.25 a 
bottle.

'This is 
absolutely lovely, I feel like a celebrity,' Burgess said. 'It has 
simply never occurred to me to order champagne before, I'm happy with 
orange juice and water.

'I feel like James Bond': David tries out a Ferrari California convertible worth £160,000

Thinking ahead: 'I'd need a car I could sleep in the back of,' said Dave

'It's a very nice treat but I am not 
sure it is worth £50 - that's my food budget for a month. I'm definitely
telling my son about this, he won't believe it. I prefer sitting out by the sea and cooking soup over an open fire.'

Mr
Burgess then ordered a £24 lunch of pan-fried Devonshire sea bass, 
which came with fennel puree, confit tomato, fennel cream and a rich 
fish red wine sauce.

He said, 'That's a very small portion
for the money. It hardly seems worth it. It is absolutely beautiful 
though, I haven't eaten food like this for years. I usually have nettle soup or shellfish and seaweed so this is a real change.'

Mr Burgess - who has been divorced 
from his wife for 33 years - said he could be convinced to dine out more
but only if he found his very own 'Girl Friday'.

Continuing his tour, he then visited a
Marks & Spencer for the first time, where he joked with staff that 
he fancied a 'nice young bird' to take home and said he could not 
believe the prices of items on the carefully stocked shelves.

'I can't believe the amount of food on offer here and all of the places it comes from,' Mr Burgess said.

'If
I need to shop, I go to local organic stores where most of the produce 
is local. All of this is very exotic.There are so many ready meals too. I
don't have electricity at home, let alone a microwave.

'I don't suppose you could cook them over an open fire because all the plastic would melt.'

Mr Burgess also went for his first-ever
suit fitting at Moss Bros in Exeter, who measured him up for a neat new outfit.

He kept
his battered brown hat on, along with scruffy jeans and a flowing velvet scarf,
as he examined the suits.

His favourite
was a smart Ted Baker outfit, costing a cool £279, but also liked a Moss Bros
£129 version.

Hidden away: The shack is so remote that it is an hour's walk away from the nearest road

Mr Burgess
said: 'These suits do look very smart but I am happy in my own clothes.

'I
always shop at charity shops - you can pick up some real bargains there.'

And David beamed with excitement as he tried out a
Ferrari California convertible - worth an eye-watering £160,000.

He
carefully sat inside the cream-coloured car - which boasts a 4.3 litre V8
engine - at Ferrari dealership Carrs in Exeter.

Manager
Lee Moore showed him how to work the convertible's impressive on-board computer
and gave him a tour of the fleet of Ferraris and Maseratis at the dealership.

Long time hidden: Mr Burgess first moved in to the beachside shack in the 1980s

Mr Burgess
said: 'Gosh, I feel like James Bond sat in here. I had a horse and
carriage when I was in my 40s and 50s as I worked in a gypsy museum in
Somerset.

'I
imagine this would be a bit quicker though. It's lovely.

'I
don't really like driving to be honest, I find the traffic too stressful. I
wouldn't even think about buying the Ferrari, it's not for me.

Ear we go: David spent half an hour carefully studying computers, iPhones and iPads, which he admitted he was 'bemused' by

'I'd
need a car I could sleep in the back of, it would be my dream to have a camper
van.

'I
feel pretty awkward sat in this, I'm worried I'm going to break it.'

He also told of his shock as he tried out an 'amazing' iPod for the first time - as he visited the smart Apple store in Exeter, Devon, which stocks
the latest technology from the iconic brand.

He spent
half an hour carefully studying computers, iPhones and iPads, which he
admitted he was 'bemused' by.

Mr Burgess
said: 'Everyone is always saying that I should get a computer but I've
never had one.

'I
don't really see the point. These things all look very smart but they are
nothing compared to the view I get when I look out to the sea.

'I
suppose if I went abroad to work on an organic farm then I might get an email
address to keep in touch with people.

'I've
never seen anything like this before, it really is amazing. It's certainly
opened my eyes to new things.'

Mr Burgess began building his idyllic home in 1985.The woodland site is an hour's walk from the nearest road down a treacherous path and only a handful of people knew of his existence - until now.

But he could be forced to leave his beachfront paradise after bosses at Exmoor National Park threatened to evict him.

He is now awaiting a decision from park chiefs as they decide his fate.
