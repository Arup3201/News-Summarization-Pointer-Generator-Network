Former Cuban President Fidel
Castro has finally met with all five of the Cuban spies who were freed from a U.S. prison as part of a deal to strengthen diplomatic ties.

The former intelligence officers gathered at the ex-revolutionary leaders home in Havana on Saturday, 73 days after the last of them were released in an inmate swap.

It had been highly anticipated as a reunion of Cuba's most
vaunted heroes, but officials are yet to explain why it took
so long to arrange. 

Historic encounter: Former Cuban President Fidel Castro, 88, finally met with all five of the Cuban spies who were freed from US prison 

Politics: The gathering at his home in Havanna came 73 days after the last of them were freed in a prisoner swap that was part of the deal to restore diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba 

Castro wrote in an article in the daily Granma newspaper about the five-hour visit that appeared in official media on Monday, accompanied by photos of the get-together.

The politician goes by the title of 'historic leader' in retirement
and the five intelligence agents were recently honored as Heroes
of the Republic for spying on anti-Castro extremist groups in
the United States and withstanding prison, unjustly according to
Cuba.

'The five anti-terrorist heroes, who never did any damage to
the United States, were trying to prevent and impede terrorist
acts against our people that, it is well known, were organized
by U.S. intelligence services,' Castro wrote.

Jailed since 1998, the final three of the agents returned
home on December 17, when Cuba and the United States completed a
prisoner swap as part of the deal in which they agreed to
restore diplomatic relations after more than five decades of
confrontation.

The group were arrested in 1998 and convicted in 2001 for spying for Cuba's government 

It had been highly anticipated as a reunion of Cuba's most vaunted heroes, but officials have not said why it took so long to arrange

The other two had already returned home after
completing their sentences.

In exchange, Cuba freed a Cuban man who spied for Washington
and spent nearly 20 years in jail. 

In addition, Cuba freed
imprisoned American aid worker Alan Gross on humanitarian
grounds plus 53 people that United States considered political
prisoners.

Fidel Castro stepped down from power in 2008, handing off to
his younger brother Raul, 83. 

Fidel Castro occasionally writes a
column and is seen in the official media receiving dignitaries
at his Havana home, but he has not been spotted in public since
Jan. 8, 2014.

Fidel Castro's current role in policy-making is unknown.
Many Cubans presume Raul Castro consults with his brother on
major decisions, and Fidel Castro's long absence after the
announcement raised questions about his health and whether he
agreed with ceasing hostilities with the Americans.

Intelligence agents Gerardo Hernandez, 49, Antonio Guerrero,
56, and Ramon Labañino, 51, came home on Dec. 17 after serving
16 years in U.S. jails.

Two others, Rene Gonzalez, 58, and Fernandez Gonzalez, 51,
had previously returned after fulfilling their sentences. 

The group shared stories and shook the hand of the former leader during the meeting

They showed each other books, pictures and mementos during the encounter 

Fidel Castro has been out of the public eye for a long time, raising questions about his health and influence in the policy-making process
