Everton are poised to sign Christian Atsu ahead of other rivals for the Ghanaian's signature.

The 22-year-old has been on loan at Vitesse and was left out of Wednesday's friendly between the two sides.

Everton completed the £28m signing of Romelu Lukaku on Wednesday and that permanent deal allows them to sign another Chelsea player on loan.

In demand: Atsu is wanted by a host of clubs across Europe

Sportsmail reported Everton's interest last month in Atsu but since then Aston Villa and Sunderland also made enquiries among 10 other clubs.

Everton are signing David Henen from Anderlecht and have an interest in taking Lacina Traore back on loan from Monaco also.

Chelsea, meanwhile, are monitoring developments with Edinson Cavani at Paris St Germain. The Uruguay international has stated he is happy to stay in Paris but his representatives have held talks with Manchester United and the Stamford Bridge club ahead of a possible move.

Everton are continuing talks with MK Dons over teenager Brendan Galloway also.
