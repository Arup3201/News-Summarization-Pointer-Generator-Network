This may be one of the most adorable cases of mistaken identity the animal world has ever known.

A baby raccoon dog was confused for a bear cub and taken in by local police in Shanghai, China.

The mix-up was not discovered until an officer posted pictured of the cub online wearing a miniature police uniform.

What a coon-artist! This baby raccoon dog was mistaken for a bear cub and taken in by police in Shanghai

Undercover officer: The case of mistaken identity was discovered after these adorable pictured were posted on Chinese microblogging site Weibo by one of the officers at the police station

Bear-ly: After a closer look, it becomes clear that the little raccoon dog definitely isn't related to a bear

Shanghai Police found the ‘bear cub’ when they responded to a call from a local man who reported that he had discovered a bear cub in his back garden, police officer Li Wenyue said.

Liu went and collected the bear and made a temporary home for it in a shoebox at the police station.

After posting the pictures online, she was contacted by a person from the local forestry department who told her that the ‘cub’ was actually a baby raccoon dog.

The youngster has since been taken in by the forestry department who will release it back into the wild once it is old enough.

The raccoon dog has been given its name due to its close resemblance to the common raccoon but is in fact a species of dog and is not closely related to the raccoon, but rather to the fox.

Far-fetched claim: The raccoon dog is closer related to dogs and foxes than bears

Saved: Fortunately for this little rascal, he will be released back into the wild, unlike the 1.5 million raccoon dogs bread for fur in China every year

It is commonly used in the Chinese fur trade, known for skinning raccoon dogs alive, where it is called ‘murmansky fur’.

A 2005 investigation found that approximately 1.5 million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China at any given time.

There have been calls for the banning of using raccoon dogs for fur after several incidents of international retailers mislabeling raccoon dog fur as fake.

In 2006 several American designers were discovered to be selling raccoon dog fur under fake labels, including Jay-Z's label Rocawear, P-Diddy's Sean John and retailer Macy's, who all pulled the garments.
