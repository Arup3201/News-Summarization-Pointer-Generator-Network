Martin Whapshare, 73, has had this necklace chain - 
on which he had his late wife's wedding ring - allegedly stolen while in hospital

A pensioner allegedly had his late wife's wedding ring stolen from around a chain which he was wearing around his neck while being treated in hospital.

Martin Whapshare, 73, spent more than 40 days in Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, where he was treated for a life-threatening infection.

After his wife Mavis passed away aged 78 in June last year, the former warehouseman had her gold wedding ring fitted on his necklace next to a gold St Christopher pendant, so it was always 'close to his heart'.

But on July 19, one month after he was admitted to hospital, Mr Whapshare's daughter Dawn Granger realised his the jewellery had gone missing from around his neck.

Police have now launched an investigation into the missing jewellery.

The incident took place just weeks after the couple, who had three children, would have celebrated their golden wedding anniversary.

Mrs Granger, 43, said: 'I knew he had it on in hospital, because I took a picture of him and you can clearly see it around his neck.

'Somebody must have taken it while he was asleep, because it was a strong chain. He loved that ring, just like he loved my mum. It’s despicable what’s happened.'

The grandfather-of-six, who has now been moved into temporary sheltered accommodation, has a picture of her on his dinner tray so he does not have to eat alone.

Mrs Granger said she felt sick when she realised the necklace was gone.

She said: 'When I noticed it was gone, I asked ‘Dad, where’s your necklace?’ He didn’t know, he’s really not very well.

Mr Whapshare and his wife Mavis tied the knot in 1964, pictured above, and were married for almost 50 years when she died in June last year

Since his wife's death, the pensioner has worn her gold wedding ring on a
 chain which he wears around his neck, alongside a St Christopher 
pendant, so it is 'close to his heart'

'He is devastated because it was my mother’s wedding ring and they got married at the end of June in 1964.

'He always says to people that he wears it close to his heart because that is where she is. It’s quite a hard time for him and this on top is just heart-wrenching.

'I’m more heartbroken than he is really because I’m more aware.'

His daughter Dawn Granger noticed the keepsake was missing when she went to visit her father in Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, where he had been treated for one month

The hospital say they have conducted a thorough search of the ward and found a silver chain with a pendant on it, but this is not the jewellery that belongs to Mr Whapshare.

Mrs Granger added: 'The whole situation makes me sick. It was worth around £500, but to me and my family it was priceless.

'I wouldn’t sell my mum’s ring for a million pounds.'

A spokesman for the hospital, pictured, said staff searched the ward to try and find the necklace and would continue searching for the missing items

A Darent Valley spokesman said: 'A family member has reported that her parent’s necklace with a pendant and wedding ring went missing during their stay in hospital.

'After a search of the ward we found objects that appeared to match closely the initial description of the missing items but the family member has since advised us these are not her parent’s.

'We are continuing to look for the missing items but would remind patients not to bring valuables into hospital, and to arrange for a friend or relative to keep them safe at home during their stay.'

A police statement said: 'Kent Police is investigating an alleged theft from the person of another in Dartford.'
