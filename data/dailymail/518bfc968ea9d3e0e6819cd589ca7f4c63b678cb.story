Amid all the Apple hubbub over the last few days, Dell quietly released the world’s thinnest laptop.

The sleek device features an edge to edge display and multiple cameras for true 3D images.

It runs Android 4.4 and will go on sale at the end of the year in the US and possibly other countries, although a price has not yet been announced.

Earlier this week, while Apple was busy revealing its new iPhone and Apple Watch, Dell quietly released a new tablet in San Francisco. The Dell Venue 8 7840 (press image shown) is 6mm (0.24 inches) thick making it the world's thinnest tablet. It also comes with four cameras, three of which can take '3D images'

The device was announced at the 2014 Intel Developers Conference in San Francisco, reports Gizmodo.

Called the Dell Venue 8 7000 series, the tablet is a mere 6mm (0.24 inches) thick, beating Sony’s 6.4mm (0.24 inches) Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact.

It has an 8.4-inch screen with a 2560 x 1600 OLED panel built by Samsung.

Screen size: 8.4 inches (21.3 cm)

Resolution: 2560 x 1600

Thickness: 0.24 inches (6 mm)

Operating system: Android 4.4

Processor: Quad-core 2.33 GHz Intel Atom Z3580

Storage: 32GB

Release: Late 2014

In addition to this, the glass of the so-called 'Infinity Display' stretches almost from edge to edge. 

This particular model, the Dell Venue 8 7840, comes with four cameras.

Three of them are on the back, with the main one being eight megapixels.

The other two enable use of Intel’s RealSense technology.

This is intended to be able to take 3D images and possibly allow for gesture control akin to Microsoft’s Kinect, although this feature has not been confirmed for the tablet.

 

Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Inc, speaks about the new Dell Venue 8 7000 series tablet at the 22014 Intel Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday 9 Sept in San Francisco.  The Dell Venue 8 7000 Series tablet is the world's thinnest tablet with the world's best tablet display available

In Dell's tablet the RealSense technology is used to allow images to be finely tuned, with a user able to adjust focus after an image has been taken.

The RealSense technology can even be used to measure the distance between two points in a photo so, for example, by taking a picture of a table you could work out its dimensions with a few taps.

Dell also says the tablet has smart albums that ‘enhance and organise every amazing image’.

An optional adapter will also enable the device to be connected to a keyboard and mouse.
