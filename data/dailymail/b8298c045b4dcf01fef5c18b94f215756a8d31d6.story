Beaming broadly as a spiky haired Italian clown named Fumagali approached, Prince Albert of Monaco was clearly in a good mood as he enjoyed an evening at the circus with sister Princess Stephanie.

The International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo is an annual event in the principality and has been running since 1974.

But while Albert and Stephanie appeared to be enjoying the show, the newest additions to Monaco's royal family were nowhere to be seen.

All smiles: Prince Albert and Princess Stephanie enjoy the antics of Italian clown Fumagalli

What a gentleman! Ringmaster Petit Gougou plants a kiss on Stephanie's outstretched hand

New mother Princess Charlene was also absent, having chosen to remain at home with month-old twins, Jacques Honoré Rainier and Gabriella Thérèse Marie.

Their absence didn't prevent Prince Albert from enjoying himself, however, although the event briefly took a sombre turn at the beginning of the night.

Part way through the opening ceremony, a minute's silence was held in memory of stunt rider Kevin Ferrari, a.k.a Flic Flac Moto X, 24, who was killed during an accident in rehearsals on Wednesday.

Despite his death, the show continued after the minute's silence with elephants, acrobats and clowns all on the billing.

At one point, Princess Stephanie, who is no stranger to circuses, was left smiling when ringmaster Petit Gougou approached and planted a kiss on her hand - much to Albert's amusement.

Royal approval: The clown, real name Giovanni Huesca, raised smiles all round

Round of applause: Albert, who was taking a night off from daddy duties, claps at the end of the performance

Welcome: New father Albert also got a round of applause of his own and waved at the crowd appreciatively

Looking good: Despite having two tiny babies to care for, Albert looked surprisingly fresh

Royal wave: Albert waves to the Monte Carlo crowd from the comfort of the royal box

Tribute: Ahead of the performance, there was a minute's silence for a performer who died earlier this week

The prince himself certainly appeared to enjoy the show, gasping in delight as a daredevil stunt rider appeared, throwing himself into the air from the back of his galloping horse.

Stephanie, who is patron of the International Circus Festival, was making her second visit to the Big Top in a week, having already met clowns and elephant trainers on Tuesday.

During that visit, the 49-year-old, who eloped with an elephant trainer in 2000, was seen patting one of the circus' pachyderms, looking unruffled as it began waving its trunk.

The royal, who also helps to oversee the Circus Festival and is involved in everything from choosing the acts to the choreography, first attended the event when she was just nine.

Her father Prince Ranier was the brains behind the first festival, which now as then, specialises in traditional circus acts  from clowns to acrobats. 

Left at home: Princess Charlene chose to remain at the Palais Princier along with the baby twins

Glamorous: The chic 36-year-old was last seen on the 7th January when the babies were presented

Daredevil: A member of Russian group Yakov Ekk performs in front of the royal box

Ouch! An Asian elephant trained by Elvis Errani shows off his dexterity during the performance
