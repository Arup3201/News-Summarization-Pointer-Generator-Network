A prominent Republican campaigner is due in court today after five women came forward to say he had raped or sexually assaulted them.

Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, has been accused of attacks going back to April 2010 when one woman said he took her to his remote cabin for lunch and insisted they watch a movie. He then tried to kiss her and when she told him to stop, he exposed his genitals.

The mother managed to escape the lodge in Heber, Utah after showing Peterson that she had a holstered gun.

The latest victim came forward on Monday after four other women had accused the Republican stalwart of sexual assault.

Peterson, from Orem City, Utah, is due to appear at district court in Salt Lake City this morning to begin a two-day hearing.

Defiant: Peterson in court today for a preliminary hearing to see if he will stand trial for rape

The judge will decide whether he will stand trial on 23 charges including rape, assault and kidnapping. 

According to the Salt Lake Tribune, in March 2011 Peterson allegedly raped a woman he attended church with at his cabin in Heber after she had agreed to go to a movie with him. 

Peterson drove her to his home after threatening her with a gun allegedly stored in the glove compartment.

Four months later, the GOP activist allegedly struck again after taking a woman to a movie in the city of Sandy, Utah.

He then threatened to expose her for having an expired immigration visa before driving her to his cabin and raping her.

After that he forced her to go to his mother's house where he continued to assault her for two days.

In December 2011, Peterson then reportedly turned to online dating sites to find his victims.

After setting up a lunch date with one woman, he turned up at her home in West Jordan and sexually assaulted her.

This April, he met another woman through
 a dating site and attempted to attack her in the bedroom of her Salt 
Lake City home before she managed to fight him off.

Peterson has been held on $750,000 bail at Salt Lake County jail since July 18.

Peterson often used his cabin to hold Republican events which were attended by the GOP elite including Senator Orrin Hatch, Governor Gary Herbert, Representative Jason Chaffetz and congressional candidate Mia Love.

The 37-year-old accountant has been deeply involved in GOP events in Utah. After receiving an MBA at Brigham 
Young University, he went on to set up Peterson Wealth Management and 
online trading site smartstocks.com.

He
 used his business connections to organize the Rocky Mountain 
Conservatives Convention 2010 at his log cabin in Heber, which is 
surrounded by three large reservoirs.

Accused: Peterson is due to appear in court today in Salt Lake City where it will be decided if he is to be tried on 23 charges including rape, assault and kidnapping 

Defense attorney Cara Tangaro said that she would present information at Peterson's hearing 'about the strength, or lack thereof, of this case'.

Three more women have also come forward to say that they were abused by Peterson but no charges have been filed although public prosecutors were not ruling it out.

GOP members had distanced themselves from Peterson since the allegations emerged.

Emails to the Utah Republican Party by MailOnline went unanswered.

Shortly after Peterson was charged in July, one female acquaintance, who met the 37-year-old at a Mormon church singles event, said he had aggressively pursued her to go to his cabin.

Haley Hayes told KLS: 'He really did corner me for an hour and a half. I know the situation those girls were in and I can't even imagine.'
