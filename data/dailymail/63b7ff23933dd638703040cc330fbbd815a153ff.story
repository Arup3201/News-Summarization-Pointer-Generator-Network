On tonight's episode of TLC's My Strange Addiction, a 27-year-old woman shares her obsession with her stuffed toy lamb.

Ever since Audrey received the lamb as a gift five years ago, she has been unable to function without it, even bringing it to the gym with her when she works out.

'The lamb is my best friend,' she says in a trailer for the TLC show. 'I take it with me everywhere I go.'

Obsessed: On tonight's episode of TLC's My Strange Addiction, 27-year-old Audrey has been unable to function without her stuffed toy lamb for the past five years

Special bond: Audrey played with toys as a child, but none ever made her feel the way the blue lamb does

Audrey says she played with stuffed animals as a child, but nothing ever compared to how she feels about this blue lamb.

'The lamb just sort of spoke something to me that no other stuffed animal ever has before,' she explains.

And it's not just the typical human-toy relationship for Audrey. 

'I think the lamb and I share a 
spiritual connection,' she says. 'When I am looking into the lamb's 
eyes, I feel a sense of comfort and peace. I can just feel all the 
stress floating up and away.'

Fun in the sand: She even takes her toy to the playground. 'The lamb loves to be outdoors,' she says

Pals: The lamb is Audrey's best friend. 'He is really just carefree and adventurous and awesome,' she gushes

Doing exercise: In one shot, Audrey is seen working out on a treadmill with her lamb tucked into her fanny pack

The video sees Audrey smiling as her toy rides on the merry-go-round.

She takes it to a playground, reads it bedtime stories, brings it for a walk on the beach and even pretends to feed it.

In one shot, Audrey is seen working out on a treadmill with her lamb tucked into her fanny pack.

And
although her sister Ansley calls her relationship with the lamb 
'strange', Audrey maintains: 'He is really just carefree and adventurous
and awesome.'

Tonight's episode also features a girl who is addicted to eating deodorant.

Nineteen-year-old Nicole, whose obsession began two years ago, now consumes 15 sticks of deodorant a month.

More than a toy: 'I think the lamb and I share a spiritual connection,' Audrey says. 'When I am looking into the lamb's eyes, I feel a sense of comfort and peace'

Toy pet: Audrey treats the lamb like a real animal, petting it and even feeding it cucumbers

Her addiction is so extreme that it has taken over her life.

'When I wake up in the morning I want deodorant,' she says in a trailer for the episode. 'After each meal I want deodorant. When I’m stressed out, I eat deodorant.'

Even in her sleep, Nicole can't shake her cravings. 'In the middle of the night, I wake up out of my sleep and I want deodorant,' she explains.

Nicole uses the cap to scoop it out from the stick like a spoon, then chews and swallows it.

And she buys specific brands of deodorant because she prefers the ones with a 'richer taste.'

Odd behavior: Nicole uses the cap as a spoon and scoops out chunks of deodorant to chew on and swallow

'It’s really soft,' she says. 'It feels like it melts in my mouth. It has its own unique taste.'

Nicole first developed an urge to 
taste deodorant when she was four years old. But two years ago, her 
cravings turned into a full-fledged addiction.

She admits: 'I take deodorant with me everywhere I go, because I never know when I’m going to crave it.'

Nicole also uses spray deodorant to satisfy her addiction, which she says she likes even better because the residue doesn't get stuck in her teeth.

Particular flavor: She buys specific brands of deodorant because she prefers the ones with a 'richer taste'

'The first time I did it, it made my 
tongue really numb for a couple of hours,' she says of using aerosol 
deodorant. 'But I just love the taste.'

Other bizarre addictions from the series include a woman who can't stop eating cat hair, a man in love with a car, and a couple with an unshakable penchant for coffee enemas.
