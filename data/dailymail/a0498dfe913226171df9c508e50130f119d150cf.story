Police in Spain have arrested a Columbine copycat they say planned to kill thousands of students in bomb attacks at a Majorcan university.

The 21-year-old - identified only by his initials J.M.M.S - was detained as he took receipt of more than 140 kilos of explosives he had ordered over the Internet.

Detectives said he had boasted of wanting to 'do a Columbine' on a blog and expressed his sympathy for the student pair who murdered 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School in the U.S.in April 1999.

He also used the blog to vent his hate for society and warn he planned to bomb the University of the Balearic Islands before committing suicide.

The unnamed man had tried to buy guns on the black market before buying explosives over the Internet, police said.

He was arrested yesterday at an undisclosed destination in the Majorcan capital Palma after a top-level police surveillance operation.

A spokesman for Spain's National Police said in a statement released yesterday: 'We have arrested a Columbine massacre imitator who wanted to sow the University of the Balearic Islands with bombs.

'He was arrested yesterday at 10.30am in Palma as he received more than 140 kilos of explosives he had acquired over the Internet.

'In his personal blog and in 
documents seized from his home, the detainee manifests his hate towards 
society, especially university students and his decision to place nail 
bombs around the campus, contemplating the possibility of suicide in the
development of the massacre.'

Police
put the youngster under surveillance five months ago after he started 
praising Columbine massacre pair Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold on the 
Internet and blogged about his love of weapons.

The police statement said: 'During the months of investigation he made several attempts to obtain weapons illegally.

'He then requested a gun licence to be able to buy weapons legally but was unable to obtain one.

'His ultimate objective was to obtain a large amount of explosives and chemicals because - as he explained on his own blog - he had intimate knowledge of how to manufacture all types of explosives.'

Detectives named the operation to catch him Operation Columbainero in allusion to the shocking April 20 1999 massacre in Columbine, Colorado.

They said the 140 kilos of explosives they seized include 125 kilos of ammonium nitrate with nitrogen, 12 kilos of potassium nitrate, a litre of nitric acid and another litre of sulphuric acid.

Detectives believe he was also planning to steal guns to use in the massacre he had boasted he was going to carry out.

The University of the Balearic Islands is a state university located in the Majorcan capital Palma. It is thought to have nearly 17,000 students.

Senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold committed suicide after embarking on their murderous Columbine shooting spree.

It is the fourth deadliest school massacre in United States history and remains the deadliest or an American high school.
