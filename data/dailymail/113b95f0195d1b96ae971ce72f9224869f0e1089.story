A young couple has been killed by a car that collided with another vehicle before flipping over and hitting them as they took a romantic stroll on Saturday evening.

Jessica Campbell, 27, and her boyfriend Jack Lanizillotti, 28, were struck by the car near the Charles River in Boston, Massachusetts just moments after Campbell posted an image to Instagram showing a sunset over the water, writing: 'Little sunset action on the esplanade.'

The young couple, who had been together for several years and shared an apartment in Brookline, were taking a stroll near a Back Bay intersection when the freak accident occurred.

Tragic: Jack Lanzillotti and Jessica Campbell were walking in Back Bay, Boston on Saturday when two cars collided nearby and one flipped over and hit them. Lanzillotti died at the scene and Campbell died in hospital

At 9.15pm, two vehicles collided at Beacon and Fairfield streets, causing one to flip over and strike Campbell and Lanizillotti. A witness told Fox25 that one of the cars had driven through a red light.

Karen Pevenstein said she was eating dinner at her home near to the crash site when she heard the collision and a scream.

'When you heard the sound from your window, you knew it was bad, just the sound of it,' she told Fox. 'It's just a horrific scene.'

Lanzillotti, 
an Emmy-winning production manager for the Red Sox, died at the scene.

Final moments: Campbell posted this image to Instagram, writing: 'Little sunset action on the esplanade'

Loss: The couple had been together for a few years and were remembered by family as very much in love

His girlfriend, a retail analyst who was supposed to run in a Boston
 Athletic Association 10K race on Sunday morning, died at Brigham and 
Womenâ€™s Hospital, Boston Police said.

The two people in the cars were taken to Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries, police said.

Talented: Lanzillotti, 28, was an Emmy-winning production manager for the Red Sox

The drivers have not been identified and so far police have filed no charges. The collision remains under investigation.

Distraught family and friends remembered the young couple as devoted to each other and their jobs.

'They were fun and loving with each other,' Lanzillotti's mother Patricia told the Boston Globe.

He graduated from Boston University in 2008 and worked his way up to manager of Red Sox Productions/Game Operations. In 2011, he won a regional 
Emmy Award in 2011 for the video 'A stolen base lesson with Jacoby 
Ellsbury'.

'We're a lesser organization for having lost Jack,' Red Sox Productions director John Carter said in a statement.

'We
 would say, "We need a shot of Johnny Pesky hitting a single," and he 
would say, "I know right where that is".

'There is no way to describe how much we will miss him - professionally 
and personally. Our hearts are broken, and we share our sorrow with his 
family and with Jessica's family. It's just incomprehensible.'

His aunt added: 'The kid was just a perfect, perfect kid.
 He's a very responsible, loving, caring person. Jack would give you the
 shirt off his back.'

Loved: Friends left notes and flowers at the scene in Back Bay as they struggled to comprehend the loss

Campbell, who had been cheerleading captain at her high school, graduated from Northeastern University in 2010. Her father said the family was 'too distraught' to comment.

But a friend said that Campbell, asenior analyst for Kantar 
Retail, was 'just one of the greatest people you could hope to meet. Her
 personality was infectious and everybody who met her loved her. She was
 kind and loved everything about life,' the Boston Herald reported.

At the scene of the crash, mourners
left five bouquets of flowers and a note reading: 'John + Jessica you
 will never be forgotten.'
