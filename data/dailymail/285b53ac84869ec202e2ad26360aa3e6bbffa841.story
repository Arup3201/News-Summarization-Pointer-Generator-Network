The number of British children groomed and trafficked for sexual abuse by gangs has soared by 155 per cent, figures show.

In 2013, police identified 450 potential child victims who were either smuggled into the country or moved around by crime gangs, National Crime Agency data shows.

Of those, 56 were British children suspected of being trafficked for sexual exploitation – more than double the number in 2012.

The number of foreign children seen as at risk of sexual exploitation rose 11 per cent, to 88.

Another 123 minors were thought to have been brought to the UK for forced labour, often in nail bars and drugs farms, a quarter more than the previous year.

The report found that children from Vietnam were the most commonly targeted, followed by Albania and then the UK.

The number of suspected trafficking cases involving Britons rose by 173 per cent, with 27 adult and 63 child victims.

Forces have also seen a dramatic surge
 in modern slavery cases, with 141 adults and 45 children identified as 
potential victims last year.

The new figures, which emerged just 
hours after a British director called for modern slavery to be 
eradicated at the Baftas, indicate that domestic servitude cases are up 
20 per cent.

Ambivalence: Bafta-winning director Steve McQueen said on Monday: 'There are 21 million people in slavery as we sit here. I hope 150 years from now our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this film'

Steve McQueen, director 
of 12 Years a Slave, which won best film at the Baftas, called for 
action to tackle the scourge of the modern slave trade.

He said: 'There 
are 21 million people in slavery as we sit here. I just hope 150 years 
from now our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this 
film.'

According to the NCA report, human trafficking referrals increased by 47 per cent between 2012 and 2013, with a total of 1,746 suspected victims from 112 countries. Nearly two-thirds of those were female.

Liam Vernon of the NCA said part of the rise was down to increased awareness of how to refer suspected cases in the fight against  ‘a criminal trade in human misery’.

He added: 'Increased awareness, both of human 
trafficking in its various forms and the obligation of first responders 
to use the National Referral Mechanism, is a likely contributor to the 
increased number of referrals in 2013.

'We know that this is a crime which affects some of society's most vulnerable people, and some victims will remain undetected.

'The NCA is committed to relentlessly disrupting what is a criminal trade in human misery.'

The number of potential adult victims being trafficked into Britain by criminal gangs for labour exploitation has leapt by 89 per cent, with 511 being smuggled into the UK in 2013.

Police have also seen a spike in women being taken here and forced to work as prostitutes, with 563 reported victims in 2013, up 53 per cent on the previous year.

Immigrants from Albania, Nigeria and Vietnam were most common nationalities targeted.

Many victims have been brought to the UK illegally with the promise of a job only to be forced into prostitution or cannabis cultivation.

Modern Slavery and Organised Crime Minister, Karen Bradley, said: 'Today's figures are unlikely to show the full scale of modern slavery, nor the human suffering behind each statistic.

'That is why we are taking action on a number of fronts including raising public awareness.

'The National Crime Agency is leading an enhanced and coordinated response to targeting trafficking gangs, we are increasing protection for victims, and we are strengthening legislation through a Modern Slavery Bill.'
