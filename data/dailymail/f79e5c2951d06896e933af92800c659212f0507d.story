The United Nation's aid chief finally arrived in Syria today - and is now making her way to the devastated city of Homs.

Valerie Amos held talks in the capital Damascus with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is now en route to the rebel-stronghold city.

She will arrive to find a city destroyed by four weeks of bombing by troops loyal to President Bashar Assad's who are trying to stub out a year-long uprising against his regime.

Amos, who was denied access to Syria last week, is in the country on a three-day mission to try to persuade authorities to grant unhindered access for aid workers.

This, she says, is key to delivering life-saving assistance to civilians. The trip comes as Assad defies mounting international pressure to end the year-old crackdown on an uprising against him.

According to state news agency SANA, Assad said yesterday he will continue to confront 'foreign-backed terrorism.'

Since the uprising began last March, he has blamed armed gangs and foreign terrorists for the unrest, not protesters seeking change.

The UN says more than 7,500 people have been killed since Syria's uprising began. Activists put the death toll at more than 8,000.

Despite the growing bloodshed, President Barack Obama said yesterday that unilateral U.S. military action against Assad's regime would be a mistake.

The United States said it is proposing a new United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an end to violence in Syria, first by government forces and then by opposition fighters.

Russia and China, powerful Syrian allies that have blocked a Security Council resolution against Syria, have made clear they were still standing by the regime in Damascus.

Still, in a sign of China's growing alarm, Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said Beijing was pulling its workers out of Syria because of the violence.

'I can tell you most Chinese workers have been withdrawn from that country to China,' he told a news conference today.

'There are only about 100 people left there taking care of projects, assets and property. We will wait until the local situation stabilises. We will go back to Syria and restart those projects.'

Obama has resisted calls to step into the turmoil in Syria to stop Assad's bloody crackdown on protesters. He told a news conference yesterday that the international community has not been able to muster a campaign against Syria like the one in Libya that ousted Muammar Gaddafi last year.

'For us to take military action unilaterally, as some have suggested, or to think that somehow there is some simple solution, I think is a mistake,' Obama said.

'What happened in Libya was we mobilised the international community, had a UN Security Council mandate, had the full co-operation of the region, Arab states, and we knew that we could execute very effectively in a relatively short period of time. This is a much more complicated situation.'

Obama's strategy has been to use sanctions and international diplomatic isolation to pressure Assad into handing over power.

The top U.S. commander in the Middle East said the advanced air defence weapons Russia has provided to Syria would make it difficult to establish a no-fly zone there as part of an effort to help the rebellion.

Marine General James Mattis, head of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee it would take a significant military commitment even to create safe havens in Syria where aid could be delivered, as McCain suggested.
