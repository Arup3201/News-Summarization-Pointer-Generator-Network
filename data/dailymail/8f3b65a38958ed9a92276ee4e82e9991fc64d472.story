A key figure in France’s high-tax socialist government kept millions of pounds hidden in Britain, his estranged wife claimed on Thursday.

Jerome Cahuzac, 61, was President Francois Hollande’s Budget Minister - meaning he was in charge of clamping down on wealthy citizens trying to avoid paying tax - until he was forced to resign in shame last year.

But now his wife Patricia, who is divorcing her disgraced husband, has claimed he kept more than £2 million hidden in a bank account on the Isle of Man.

Much of it was due to be invested in properties in London, where French judges are currently carrying out an inquiry.

Mr Cahuzac faces prosecution and possibly five years in jail after he admitted to the account during ‘an investigation into tax fraud,’ according to France’s Sud Ouest newspaper.

‘The money trail led to the Isle of Man, where the equivalent of 2.5 million euros was found in an account opened between 1997 and 2004. The money would mostly have been invested in property in the UK’, the newspaper said.

Judges Renaud van Ruymbeke and Roger Le Loire are now widening their inquiry to other parts of Britain, especially London.

Jerome Cahuzac has been accused of tax fraud

Lawyers for the Cahuzacs would not 
comment on the latest revelations, which were confirmed by legal sources
 close to the tax investigation.

Mr Cahuzac resigned from Mr Hollande’s government a year ago following revelations that he also kept millions hidden in accounts in Switzerland and Singapore.

It was a devastating blow to Mr Hollande, who has admitted to disliking the rich and whose flagship policies include a 75 per cent top rate of income tax.

Mr Cahuzac originally made a fortune as a cosmetic surgeon but is now seen as the personification of the greed and hypocrisy of French socialists.

Like Mr Cahuzac, many wealthy French people now see Britain as a safe haven for their money, and thousands have flooded across the Channel since Mr Hollande came to power in 2012.

Mr Hollande has expelled Mr Cahuzac from his Socialist Party and announced tough new measures against corruption, including a ban from public life for any politician found guilty of tax evasion.
