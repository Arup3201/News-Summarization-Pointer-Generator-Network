Ann Harrison was kidnapped and murdered almost 25 years ago by Michael Taylor and Roderick Nunley. Controversy around Taylor's execution on Wednesday threatens to overshadow her memory

Friends of murdered schoolgirl Ann Harrison have expressed frustration that the debate over lethal injections threatens to overshadow the 25th anniversary of her death.

Ann was kidnapped while on her way to school in Kansas City in 1989, raped and then stabbed to death by Michael Taylor and Roderick Nunley, who were both sentenced to death.

On Wednesday Taylor is due to be killed by lethal injection, but last-minute legal appeals over the type of drug to be used have threatened to forestall the execution.

Tina Thomasee, who was in Ann's class at school, has said the focus should be on remembering the 'wonderful spirit' of Ann, not debating the fate of her killers.

In an interview with the Kansas City Star, she said: 'We would rather the world focus on Ann, and who she was, instead of controversies over death penalty drugs and the death penalty itself.

'Ann deserves to be remembered for the wonderful spirit that she was, and continues to be, for her family, friends and community.'

On March 22, the date of Ann's disappearance, Ms Thomasee plans to hold a ceremony to commemorate Ann's life along with other former friends and her parents.

However the national debate caused by Taylor's legal appeal over the drugs to be used in his execution mean the event could be overshadowed.

Due to difficulties in obtaining pentobarbital, a powerful sedative used in lethal injections, from a licenced drug supplier, Missouri officials have been forced to seek out smaller compounding pharmacies to make the drug.

But the use of compounded pentobarbital is controversial as it has been linked to at least one prolonged, painful execution in the case of of Michael Lee Wilson, 38, in Oklahoma.

Wilson, who was executed on January 9, said he felt his 'whole body burning' before he died after being injected with compounded pentobarbital.

Taylor's lawyers argue that the use of the chemical would cause their client 'severe, unnecessary, lingering and ultimately inhumane pain', violating the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.

The Apothecary Shoppe, a pharmacy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was due to supply the lethal chemical for Taylor's execution, has now refused to do so.

Missouri state officials say the execution will go ahead as planned as they have found another supplier, though they have refused to name the company for fear that bad publicity would drive them away.

Both Taylor and Nunley have faced execution once before and have been granted last-minute reprieves. Taylor was just hours from death in 2006 when a judge ruled the procedure should not go ahead.

But despite the controversy Ann's parents, Bob and Janel Harrison, say they are determined to see the punishment through.

Speaking to the Kansas Star, Janel said: 'People talk about closure. There’s no such thing as closure. What we want is justice for Ann.'

While the Harrison's have so far avoided the executions, Bob has vowed to be there on Wednesday if Taylor is put to death.

He said his drive to see the case through to the end is the thought of what Ann went through during her last few minutes of life.

'That’s the part I can’t stop thinking about,' he said. 'That’s the part that makes them need to have this punishment.'

Lethal injections rely on three chemicals which have been in short supply since an EU ban on exports in 2011

Introduced in Oklahoma in 1977, the lethal injection is by far the most commonly used method in executions in the United States.

Standard procedure sees IV drips inserted into both arms of the prisoner - one for the injection and another in case the main line fails.

The convict is then given three chemicals in order to kill them. The first is a barbiturate, a heavy sedative which puts them to sleep and will eventually stop their breathing even if the second two drugs are not administered.

The second is a paralytic, usually pancuronium bromide, which causes complete paralysis of all muscles, including the diaphragm, and would again cause death by asphyxiation if administered alone.

However in order to achieve the most painless death a third drug, potassium chloride, is then administered which stops the heart and causes death by cardiac arrest.

But following a ban in the EU in 2011on exporting drugs to be used in lethal injections, a shortage developed.

Licensed US manufacturers have also been refusing to supply the chemicals required, due to fears over bad publicity.

Now authorities have been forced to seek out small compounding pharmacies which are not licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, but can produce the drugs on a case-by-case basis.

Some states have also started experimenting with different combinations of lethal drugs due to the scarcity of those commonly used.

However, this has left officials open to legal challenges, the most common of which is based on the constitutional guarantee to a death free from cruel or unusual punishment.

Lawyers argue that untested drug combinations, or contaminated drugs from smaller pharmacies, will lead to lengthy, painful and ultimately inhumane deaths.

In January, Lee Wilson was executed using compounded pentobarbital and said he felt his 'whole body burning' before he died, which his lawyers agreed was the result of contamination.

Later the same month Dennis McGuire was put to death in Ohio using an untried combination of drugs, but appeared to gasp and snort during the procedure which took an unusually-long 25 minutes.
