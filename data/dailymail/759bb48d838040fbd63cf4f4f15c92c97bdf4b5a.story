When her beloved puppy was stolen, Miriam Francome refused to give up hope that the two of them would one day be reunited.

But even she found it hard to believe when, eight years later, the dog was found wandering just a few miles from her home.

The former wife of champion jockey and racing pundit John Francome had spent months putting up posters, knocking on doors and dropping leaflets after Lhasa Apso-terrier crossbreed Tweed was stolen in 2005, even offering a £1,000 reward for the dog’s safe return.

Back together: Miriam Francome has been reunited with her dog that was found after eight years wandering a few miles from her home

Mrs Francome said: ‘She was born on my bed and had never been away from me. I was completely heartbroken at the time.

‘Although I never quite gave up hope of seeing her again, I could not believe it when I got the call saying she had been found. I just burst into tears.’

Tweed had been microchipped, so when she was found in Wantage, Oxfordshire last month – not far from Miss Francome’s home village near Hungerford, Berkshire – the council was able to trace her owner.

Despite being flea-ridden and filthy, the worst Tweed, who is now nine, appeared to have suffered was a bad haircut.

‘Thankfully it doesn’t look like she has been mistreated, she is not anxious or cowering, she seems happy and relaxed,’ said  Mrs Francome. ‘She’s not been starved either and is eating well. She’s still as good-natured as I remember her to be and the vet has given her the all-clear.’

Former love: Miriam and jockey John Francome split in the early 1990s

After she was informed Tweed had been found, Mrs Francome had to wait eight days to allow anyone who may have unwittingly bought the dog in the eight years she was missing to come forward.

The former model said: ‘It was amazing when I went to pick her up, I wanted to cuddle her but she smelt so bad and her hair was all matted. Whoever had her had cut all her lovely hair off.

‘She recognised me straight away and responded to her name. When I brought her home, she knew exactly where she was.’

Mrs Francome, who dated  ex-racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks – now married to former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks –  after separating from former jockey champion  John in the early 1990s, had bred Tweed and her brother Harris from her pet Megan.

Dog Lost, a charity that helps reunite owners with their missing animals, says that 3,500 thefts were reported last year

‘We think Tweed may have been used for breeding and her puppies sold for around £200 each.

‘I
imagine that the last time whoever had her had tried to mate her, she 
didn’t conceive because of her age. And they had no more use for her and
just dumped her,’ said Mrs Francome, who now works part time as a 
barmaid and dog-sitter.

‘It is strange to think that she was so close to me all these years but I just never knew it.’

Tweed
is now settling back in at home after being reunited with her brother 
Harris and introduced to Mrs Francome’s five other dogs. She had been 
stolen during a spate of dog thefts in the area as she played with her 
brother outside Mrs Francome’s cottage on the morning of February 2, 
2005.

Dog Lost, a charity 
that helps reunite owners with their missing animals, says that 3,500 
thefts were reported last year – an increase of almost 20 per cent on 
the previous 12 months.

Popular
targets include trained working dogs, such as labradors, but the 
biggest rise has been in thefts of cocker spaniels after the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge bought their puppy, Lupo.

A post-Christmas rush to the divorce courts is being blamed for a rise in pet dogs ending up in  rescue centres.

More than 700 dogs belonging to couples splitting up will be taken in this month, a survey by the Kennel Club has revealed. 

Despite 3,500 dogs being rescued in January by groups affiliated to the Kennel Club – double the monthly average – only 53 will be unwanted Christmas presents, it added. A further 570 have become too expensive to keep.

Spokesman Laura Quickfall said: ‘The results from our survey  were surprising. We’ve always known January is a busy time for rehoming, but the survey identifies relationship breakdown as the most common cause.’
