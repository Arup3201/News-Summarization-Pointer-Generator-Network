It was going to take something special to get things going again on the old sofa. For a month of glorious World Cup football, we telly watching fans were held transfixed as the good stuff just kept on coming.

Of course, Andy Murray had the chance to have us blowing the dust off of the remote control and flick over to Wimbledon. But that was a false dawn. I suppose we’d just have to hunker down and wait for the new season to start?

Not a bit of it. Instead, a young 
Irishman making his living in our green and pleasant land got the juices 
flowing again. Rory McIlroy could not have timed his return to 
championship-winning form any better.

We needed a homegrown hero to do it it on our turf just to remind us that great sport watching comes in all shapes and sizes. And the BBC really delivered our young hero. This truly was the Roryvision Open.

There was already something in the air as early as Thursday morning. If you’re ever looking for a man to be positively Churchillian about sport in these Isles, then you need look no further than Peter Alliss. Before a ball had barely been struck he told us he was ‘pawing the ground and sniffing the air like an old war horse’ at the prospect of what was to come. It’s as if he sensed something special was about unfold over the next few days. Well, the old war horse wasn’t wrong.

And what did in fact come was delivered by the BBC in a manner that put the viewer straight in the comfort zone. Led by the venerable, veteran commentator, he completed his rounds with a bagful of voices - essentially homegrown - who suited any situation. While the images generated could have been served up with free cream teas and scones.

This was highlighted perfectly on Friday lunchtime when the director launched into a dramatic super slo-mo ‘hero package’ of Adam Scott. Andrew Cotter, in his gentle Scottish lilt, followed it with a slightly awkward ‘ladies and gentlemen. Adam Scott!’ - sounding ever so slightly awkward that they’d just been a bit too showy.

Similarly, on Saturday evening, Rory was pieced together in a montage boasting a piece of music Hollywood in its heyday might have thought a bit over the top. Yes, the Americans do it in their coverage. And it sits perfectly well in their Tournaments. But here, well, Peter Alliss had only told us minutes earlier he’d had a postcard from Claire who’d been fed up with the football and couldn’t wait for The Ryder Cup.

While on Sunday morning, Dan Walker was stood on a picnic table outside the fish and chip stall asking ‘good people of Hoylake, who do you want to win this?’.

I’ll leave you to guess what the answer was. But the point is, our telly isn’t at its best when its full of bombast. It’s just not, well, British.

(I should just point out here that I really, REALLY like the graphic ribbon that accompanied some of the tee shots. So yes, if you need me, I’ll be over there in hypocrites corner)

In fact, all you really need, it would seem, is to just keep that camera set on Roryvision. Of course, this is where the BBC, and we, got lucky. Because the young maestro was captivating stuff from shot one. And there was such a pep in his step, he was even compelling viewing inbetween shots.

During the final round, the striding, imperious McIlroy was spotted in all manner of settings. There he was, at one point, stalking through the long grass like he was the subject of a David Attenborough documentary. Then he was just a white baseball cap, bobbing along in a sea of spectators. And in possibly the best telly shot of the championship, our young hero approached his standing ovation at the 18th green in perfect step with a chorus line of white polo-shirted (what Ken Brown called) ‘heavies’.

In fact, there was one more image. When Rory had won it. He left the green, went under the stand and across the footbridge to record his score. Again, Roryvision was on, but now there was no crowd, just a young champion realising what he had just achieved. His face was an absolute picture as he allowed himself to really think about what had just happened. I tell you something, it was dear old Bob Hoskins at the end of The Long Good Friday good!

Those heady days when Christ The Redeemer wore the sun like a halo as we said farewell to a magnificent World Cup are only just over a week old. And my front room is better for having played host to them. But a few rounds of golf by the seaside up on the Wirral means that great sport on the telly is already moving on.
