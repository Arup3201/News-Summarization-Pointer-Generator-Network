Long before Cara and her power brows took the modelling world by storm, there was another member of the Delevingne clan rocking the catwalk.

Poppy, 28, began modelling in 2008 after being spotted by the same model scout as sister Cara and has since worked for  Burberry, Louis Vuitton and Mango, among others.

Now, the Chanel brand ambassador has used her fashion expertise to design a range of swimwear - and has modelled everything herself.

Designer: Poppy Delevingne shot to fame as a model but now she has turned swimwear designer

Poppy has teamed up with swimwear label Solid & Striped to create the preppy range of bikinis and swimming costumes.

Poppy, who is also 'Young Ambassador' for the British Fashion Council, was already a  fan of the brand and wore the designs during her Popchella hen weekend at the Coachella festival.

Speaking to Style.com about her efforts, which are being sold through Net-a-Porter, she said: 'I was instantly drawn to the suits because they were sexy and fun and you didn't feel uncomfortable in them. 

'I could run around and do cartwheels in them!'

The pieces are, said the model, designed to reflect her 'active' lifestyle and come with fun prints, among them flamingo motifs, and bold block colours.

Activewear: Poppy, who has a busy schedule, says she wanted her designs to reflect that and cater to active women

Lithe: Poppy was spotted back in 2008 and has built a huge name for herself in the modelling world ever since, so it was only a matter of time before she turned to designing 

Collaboration: The newlywed's range for Solid & Striped came off the back of her wearing and loving the range

Something for everyone: As well as skimpy bikinis, there's also plenty of more modest swimsuits in the new range, which is available on Net-a-Porter

'I have an active schedule and life - this is for the active girl,' she added. 

It has certainly been an active few weeks for the model and muse, who put in a stylish appearance at the Museum of Modern Art's 2014 Film Benefit honouring director Alfonso Cuaron on Monday.

Dressed in a colourful Chanel dress, the model ensured that all eyes were on her as she arrived at the New York event.

But one man who wasn't there to witness her dramatic dress sense was Poppy's husband James Cook, who remained behind in London.

The pair married six months ago in a lavish two-part wedding, which began in the British capital and continued in the Moroccan city of Marrakech.

Cara, who? Her little sister is focusing more on her acting career in the New Year and it looks like Poppy is getting ready to take her place in the fashion world

Fun prints: Poppy wanted the designs to reflect her personality and lifestyle so opted for colourful prints such as this flamingo one

Party girls: Poppy was already a fan of the brand and wore the designs at her Popchella bachelorette weekend at Coachella festival with sister Cara, left, and Sienna Miller

Model and muse: Poppy was scouted by Storm's Sarah Doukas in 2008 and has since worked for Chanel and Louis Vuitton
