To her neighbours in a small, rural hamlet in outback Australia, Nina Bekker is a confident woman and caring mother.

But the 50-year-old teacher still carries the mental scars from 1978 when she was sexually assaulted three times in one night by Rolf Harris.

She was only 14 at the time and the events of 36 years ago had an immense impact on her life.

Her daughter Hannah explained: ‘It shows in the way she relates to people.

'I see it in the way she lacks confidence in so many things, and how she questions herself. It’s like she carries these injuries which don’t ever go away.’

Being on a train or a bus in close proximity to other passengers, Miss Bekker would shake uncontrollably and the smell of aftershave or sweat made her nauseous.

Miss Bekker was staying at a motel on the outskirts of Sydney with her parents and brother when the assaults took place.

‘I had never so much as held hands with a boy – Rolf Harris took advantage of my complete naivety and inexperience with men,’ she recalls. ‘I can never forgive him for that.’

One evening Harris arrived in the dining room with Australian environmentalist Harry Butler. ‘The two of them were very loud, very boisterous, singing dirty ditties and moving about the room sort of showing off and drawing attention to themselves,’ remembers Miss Bekker.

Harris was encouraged to join a nearby group for drinks and later serenaded Miss Bekker’s mother and another woman with sexual innuendo.

Miss Bekker was keen to interview Mr Butler for a school conservation project and he invited her to his room for a chat.

She said: ‘Leaving my parents in the restaurant I followed Mr Butler and Harris followed both of us into the lift.  As soon as we were in the lift, Rolf Harris began to touch me.

‘Initially his behaviour was like childish teasing, he was poking me in the ribs, tickling me, he called me “little miss spaghetti legs”.

‘He pinched my buttocks and seemed to think it was funny that I was embarrassed by this.

‘I felt very uncomfortable with the way he was touching me but it was difficult to object because it was projected as innocent, playful teasing. When we got out of the lift his behaviour became more intrusive.

‘Rolf Harris walked behind me and as he did, he pressed his stomach and groin into my back and put his arms over my shoulders in a kind of hug, except that his hands were cupped over my breasts.

‘He was making a pinching action with his fingers more or less tweaking my breasts in time to a sing-song nursery rhyme tune.

‘I remember he called me a “little wriggly one” and sang something like “legs like spaghetti and breasts like ripe plums” which rhymed with “tiddle um pum pum” – I now know this is a line from one of his songs.

‘This was incredibly humiliating for me. The behaviour of Rolf Harris was absolutely devastating.’

Minutes later, Harris assaulted her again. Miss Bekker said: ‘As I was walking along the corridor I realised I didn’t have a pen or paper, so I went back along the corridor and into my room.

‘I was in the motel room, putting an ink cartridge into my pen when Rolf Harris entered the room behind me.  He asked me what I was doing and took the pen and cartridge from me. In doing so, he spilled ink all over my school rucksack.

‘He asked me to show him my hands, saying something to the effect that “we didn’t want inky pinkies”. When I held my hands up, he took my wrists and raised my hands toward his neck and shoulders and started to try to make me hug him.

‘He was saying “come on, how about you give an old bloke a hug, Rolfie deserves a cuddle doesn’t he?”.

‘He was speaking in a coaxing voice and seemed to ignore that I was clearly uncomfortable with this. I was holding my hands like closed fists so that he could not imagine that I had any intention of hugging him and I was pulling away from him.

‘He released my wrists and moved his arms under mine, preventing me from lowering them and he reached around and grabbed my buttocks and lifted me up toward him and he crouched down in an awkward stance, bending his knees into a grotesque posture.

‘For the first time in my life I reacted strongly and shoved him away.’ Miss Bekker swore at Harris and left the room to finish her interview with Mr Butler before heading back to the restaurant.

She went on: ‘I returned to the lift. There was no sign of Rolf Harris. But as I was in the lift and the doors were closing he reappeared and put his arm or leg between the closing doors to make them re-open.

‘He made this all seem very dramatic, bouncing into the lift and bumping into the back wall and then in front of me.

‘As soon as the lift closed, he stood in front of me, put one arm around me as though to hug me, but grabbed my wrist and held me in an arm lock, which effectively forced my back to arch and pushed my chest toward him.

‘In the same action he put his other hand inside my shirt and put his hand over my breasts, commenting in a matter of fact voice that “my breasts really were like lovely ripe plums”.

‘This happened very quickly and his actions were very fluid and in retrospect, seemed rehearsed – as though he was very practised in this motion.

‘This attack lasted altogether maybe ten to twenty seconds.  It was very sudden, forceful and entirely against my will.

‘His behaviour was not about sexual gratification, it was about disempowering women, humiliating them. It reflects his whole attitude to women – he is simply a vicious bully.’

Miss Bekker spoke to a reporter last year who passed her details to the Metropolitan Police. She was prepared to testify against Harris, but was not called by the prosecution.

An aspiring teenage actress tried to kill herself after being abused by Harris on a youth theatre tour.

Tonya Lee, a 43-year-old Australian, waived her right to anonymity to tell how the pervert fondled her on a visit to London when she was 15.

As she sat on his lap in a pub, Harris, then 56, indecently touched her.

Terrified, she fled to the toilets but when she emerged, he pinned her up to a wall and molested her

Traumatised, she stopped eating and then endured a 16-year battle with anorexia, alcoholism and bulimia. Miss Lee later attempted to end her life with a cocktail of laxatives and alcohol.

Jurors saw pictures of her on what she thought would be a ‘trip of lifetime’ in 1986.

Miss Lee told how she was overwhelmed with excitement when she and 13 other children were greeted by Harris when they landed at Heathrow.

During a pub meal later, she said she felt special when he singled her out, saying: ‘Oh hey Tonya, tell me a bit about yourself.

'Come and sit down on my lap.’ She wept as she told how the ordeal left her feeling like an ‘empty vessel’.

Miss Lee said: ‘I tried to kill myself. I got really sick from self-abuse.

'I was drinking. I had eating disorders and I was taking 80 laxatives a day and throwing up. Just hurting myself time and time again.’÷ For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or see www.samaritans.org.
