Sunderland completed the signing of Jack Rodwell to end his spell in the wilderness at Manchester City — and the player then set his sights on getting back into the England team.

The midfielder wants to revive his career in the North East after struggling for first-team football at City, mainly due to persistent hamstring injuries.

As revealed by Sportsmail, Rodwell was given permission to make the transfer, understood to be in the region of £10million with £3m of add-ons, after City boss Manuel Pellegrini told him he was not in his plans.

Rodwell, 23, had made just 27 appearances since his £12m move from Everton in 2012. Gus Poyet is confident he can help the player finally realise his early potential.

He met with Rodwell on Monday and he agreed to sign a five-year deal on wages of around £65,000 per week.

After completing the switch, Rodwell, who has won three England caps, said: ‘Watching the World Cup left a little bit of a bitter taste in my mouth. I was supporting the team 100 per cent but I also wanted to be there so I think it’s time I put that right, get back playing and get back in the squad.

'Without doubt the last couple of seasons I have not played nearly enough football as I have wanted to play.

‘The regular football is the most important thing for me, to play football and get back to enjoying it, so this is a great place for me to be.

‘It’s such a good club with passionate fans and I can’t wait to get on board.’

Manchester United first-team coach Phil Neville, who was at Everton when Rodwell came through as a teenager, has tipped his former teammate to make a return to the England fold.

‘Good move for Jack Rodwell,’ he said. ‘Time for him to play every week and show everyone his ability. If he stays injury free he will be back in the England squad.’

Sunderland hope that signing Rodwell will encourage Fabio Borini to join them. It is understood they have matched Liverpool’s £14m valuation and have made the Italian striker an offer, but Borini is holding out for a club who can offer him Champions League football.
