Kids are no longer the only ones getting caught out for bad grades.

Adult Americans have ranked third last in a new international survey graphing basic numeracy skills across the world's 23 leading labor countries.

And the literacy results are not much better, with the US proving well below the international average in the first-ever survey, which tested 5000 Americans aged 16 to 65.

Overall only about one in eight Americans turned in a top performance in reading.

Scathingly, some 112 people were unable to complete the survey's standard background questionnaire 'because of a literacy-related barrier: either the inability to communicate in English or Spanish or a mental disability'.

The main problem identified by the data - developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - was with younger American workers, who lagged in nearly every category.

The oldest Americans in the sample turned in a higher-than-average performance in reading, with 9% of test-takers between 55 and 65 years old scoring at the top proficiency level, compared to just 5% worldwide.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said the findings were troubling.

Back to school: Adult Americans have been toppled in a new international survey graph of basic literacy and numeracy skills, which extensively tested 23 countries

Above average: Older Americans fared well in the survey, identifying a major gap in the workforce, with younger Americans showing the worst results. Here people read inside the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.

'Adults who have trouble reading, doing math, solving problems and using technology will find the doors of the 21st century workforce close to them,' said Education Secretary Arne Duncan

'Adults who have trouble reading, doing math, solving problems and using technology will find the doors of the 21st century workforce close to them,' Duncan told USA Today.

'We need to find ways to challenge and reach more adults to upgrade their skills.

Interestingly, Japan and Finland ranked first and second in both categories, while Italy and Spain took the bottom two spots in both.

The survey test was scored on a scale of 0-500.

In numeracy - defined as 'the ability to access, use, interpret, and communicate mathematical information and ideas, to engage in and manage mathematical demands of a range of situations in adult life' - American adults achieved an average score of 253 out of 500, nosing out Italian adults who averaged 247 and Spanish adults who averaged 246.

In literacy - defined as 'understanding, evaluating, using and engaging with written text to participate in society to achieve one’s goals and to develop one’s knowledge and potential' - American adults achieved an average of 270 out of 500. That put Americans well ahead of Italy and Spain, whose adults scored 250 and 252, respectively, but far behind Japan and Finland, whose adults scored 296 and 288 respectively.

Harvard University professor Paul Petersen said the most 'distressing' point was the time in which it will take for these results to actually take effect.

'There's a 20-year delay between the quality of the education system and its impact,' he told USA Today.

'It's sort of like watching a car crash in slow motion.'

'Other countries have been catching up for some time.

'At one time, we had a really significant lead, but those people are disappearing from the workforce.'

The 23 countries that took part in the survey - which was conducted August 2011 and April 2012 - were: Japan, Finland, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Austria, Estonia, Germany, Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, Poland, Ireland, France, United States, Italy and Spain.

Japanese adults led the field in numeracy, averaging 288 out of 500. They were followed by the Fins, who averaged 282; and the Belgians and the Dutch, who both averaged 280.

Donald Block, executive director of the Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council, said a major contributing factor to the results of the United States was a decline in resources for basic adult education.

Mr Block said this has been happening for past six years.

'We really have in this country ignored adult literacy as an important part of education,' Mr. Block said.
