Steven Hayes, who is awaiting execution for his role in the shocking 2007 Petit family home invasion that left a mother and her two daughters brutally murdered says he is refusing to eat prison food that he believes is not kosher.

In a shocking move, Hayes is suing the Connecticut Department of Correction, alleging it would not serve him a kosher diet. He says the system is forcing him to 'starve or go against God.'

Hayes was sentenced to die in July 2007 along with another man for the murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters in Cheshire.

Steven Hayes says the system is forcing him to 'starve or go against God' because the food is not kosher

In a handwritten amended complaint made public Wednesday, Hayes says he hasn't eaten any nonkosher food since August 24, and now weighs less than 120 pounds. 

State prison documents show the 5-foot-7 Hayes weighed 170 pounds in 2007.

The department offers kosher food, but Hayes contends it isn't kosher because of cross-contamination.

In March, Hayes was found in a stable condition in his cell after speaking many times of wanting to die because of his guilt over his horrifying crime.

In 2007, Petit and his family were held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by invaders Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky.

Dr Petit was severely beaten and dumped in the basement as his daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, were tied to their beds.

After the 11-year-old was raped and her mother raped and strangled to death, the intruders set the home ablaze and left all but Petit dead.

Hayes tried to commit suicide during his 2010 trial and upon hearing he would face the death penalty, told a New Haven court 'Death, to me, will be a welcome relief.'

Hayes and Komisarjevsky, are both on death row following their convictions in the 2007 triple-murder of Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley Petit, 17, and Michaela Petit, 11, and the beating of husband and father Dr. William Petit Jr.

Shocking: Hayes raped and strangled Jennifer Hawke-Petit. Her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, died of smoke inhalation after they were doused with gasoline and the house was set on fire

The pair spotted Hawke-Petit at a supermarket and followed her to her home in Cheshire, Connecticut, where they tied up the family.

Hayes raped and strangled Hawke-Petit and Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted Michaela. Both Michaela and her sister, Hayley, were tied to their beds and died of smoke inhalation after the men doused the home with gas and set it on fire.

Connecticut repealed the death penalty in 2012, but the does law not apply to those who had already been sentenced to death.

In testimony at the trial, Hayes said he had frequently attempted suicide, slashing his wrists, slamming his mother's car into a rock and tying a sock around his neck.

He also told The Hartford Courant in a 2012 interview that he concocted a plan to end his own life by obtaining oysters, to which he is deathly allergic.

He said he fabricated claims in letters that he killed 17 people in hopes that prison authorities would notify police and he could then trade information for food, including oysters.

Joshua Komisarjevsky also was convicted and sentenced to death for the home invasion killings.
