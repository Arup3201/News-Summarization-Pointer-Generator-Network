Ben Carson, the African-American former pediatric neurosurgeon whose conservative speeches have rallied the Republican Party's right wing, was accused Tuesday of plagiarizing portions of a best-selling book he wrote in 2012.

The revelation will prove embarrassing to the probable 2016 presidential contender: In the same book Carson describes being caught plagiarizing part of an assignment during his college years.

In that case, the professor forgave him and allowed him to resubmit his paper; American voters may not be as flexible. 

'America the Beautiful' contains several passages lifted from other books, from a conservative website, from press releases and from an American television network, according to the entertainment websiteBuzzfeed.

DR. PLAGIARISM? Ben Carson, a rare black luminary among the Republican Party's likely presidential condenders, stands accused or ripping parts of his 2012 book from other publications

Carson is being urged to run for the White House by a 'draft' movement that includes a $12 million political action committee

The largest apparent offense involves 156 words from SocialismSucks.net which appeared in the book verbatim.

In another, 106 words from a 2011 press release issued by the Liberty Institute, a religious freedom group, appeared in Carson's book with only minor alterations – and no citation.

THE BOOK: Buzzfeed scoured 'America the Beautiful' and found numerous instances of apparent plagiarism

And 23 words from a CBS News online article about a 2010 'national day of prayer' also appear nearly identical in his text.

US district judge Barbara Crabb, according to both, 'ruled that the government-sanctioned [event], established by Congress and marked with a proclamation from the president, is unconstitutional.'

Other instances cited by Buzzfeed are more benign, however, including several taken from books whose author, noted conservative historian Bill Federer, expressly gave permission for others to use the text.

Still more are picayune by comparison, consisting of casual rearrangement of text – but lack the footnotes and acknowledgements that are customary in nonfiction publishing.

'In many cases Carson cites the works that he plagiarizes in endnotes,' Buzzfeed reported, 'though he makes no effort to indicate that not just the source, but the words themselves, had been taken from different authors.' 

Federer's book grants permission 'to duplicate 10,000 words or less, provided acknowledgement is given.'

Carson's original text from 'America the Beautiful' makes it clear that he's aware of the need to carefully vet writing for the unauthorized use of other authors' work.

In college, he recalls, he 'found some passages that seemed particularly appropriate' to a psychology paper he was writing, 'and I included them in my writing. I did not, however, indicate that this was the work of someone else; frankly, I had never even heard of the term plagiarism.'

With a lesson learned, his 'compassionate' professor allowed him to re-submit his paper. 

'I certainly should have known inherently that what I was doing was wrong. I had done it before without consequences and probably would have continued doing it if I had not been caught,' Carson wrote in the 2012 book. 

'This raises another question: Is ignorance an acceptable excuse for unethical behavior?'

The Buzzfeed reporter who unearthed the Carson plagiarism did not immediately respond to an email asking whether other political authors' texts might be on the chopping block.

The website has already skewered Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, another shoo-in for the 2016 White House race, for plagiarism.

In his 2012 book 'Government Bullies,' Paul lifted entire sections of text from papers issued years earlier by conservative think tanks including the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute. His publisher updated the book's future editions with footnotes. 

IN YOUR FACE: Carson compared Obamacare to slavery in 2013 as the president looked on

Carson, a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon, is reportedly gearing up for a presidential run in 2016 as a Republican

An Iowa political consultant who worked for two separate GOP campaigns in 2012 told DailyMail.com that this will be the beginning of the end for Carson.

'He's basically toast,' the operative said Wednesday. 'Rand Paul can recover from this because he's in the news and he's a senator. Carson can't.'

'And his whole shtick is being a doctor, an academic. How does he explain this away?'

He asked not to be identified because he doesn't want to 'limit options' for employment in the coming campaign season.

Carson's book caught fire after a 2013 National Prayer Breakfast speech in which he called the Obamacare health insurance law 'the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.'

President Barack Obama was seated to his right as he spoke.

Carson spokeswoman Sealey Yates and a spokesman for Vernon Robinson – the conservative activist behind a political action committee urging Carson to run for president – did not respond to requests for comment.

Yates told Buzzfeed, however, that “if it is determined that additional citations or attribution are required, the appropriate revisions will be made in subsequent printings.'

'Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.'
