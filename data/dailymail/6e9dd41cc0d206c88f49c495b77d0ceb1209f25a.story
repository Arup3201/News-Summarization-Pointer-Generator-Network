A house husband who claims he sacrificed his own ambitions to help the career of his investment banker wife has won a crucial round in the couple's £11million divorce battle.

Stay-at-home father, Weng Choy, and 'breadwinner' wife, Lena Tan, lived a luxury lifestyle during their 15-year marriage, with homes in Hong Kong and Malaysia, a £1million wine collection and £4.5million apartment in Kensington.

But Mr Choy filed for divorce from his working wife in January 2012, after a blazing row days earlier on New Year’s Eve proved 'the final straw'.

After a legal wrangle over where their big-money divorce case should be heard, Mr Choy won a victory today, when appeal judges found he was entitled to fight his case before an English family judge.

Mr Choy, 56, had filed for divorce in the English High Court, seeking a slice of marital assets valued by lawyers at £11 million.

He says he abandoned his own promising banking career to care for the couple’s two sons whilst his high-flying wife went out to work.

But his wife's legal team hit back - insisted that he had no right to divorce in England.

Three Appeal Court judges today ruled Mr Choy could have his case heard in the UK because he had been ‘habitually resident’ in this country for a year before their split.

The ruling will come as a blow to his 54-year-old wife, a leading hedge fund manager, because of a world-wide perception that English judges are generous to the partners of rich spouses.

Mrs Tan's barrister, James Turner QC, had earlier told the court that, following a falling out in London’s Holland Park in September 2010, the couple’s marriage hit a 'crisis', but survived until it 'struck the rock of the row on New Year’s Eve 2011'.

Her lawyers claimed that, despite over half the couple’s wealth being invested in the UK, the divorce case should be heard in Malaysia.

The QC also asked the judges to consider the 'convenience' to Mrs Tan 'bearing in mind the need for her physical presence in Malaysia' - and the fact that her husband 'is not gainfully employed.'

However, Timothy Bishop QC, for Mr Choy, insisted his home had been in London since 2010 and that he had been forming closer ties with the city for the last 20 years.

He said: 'The judge found that they had an international marriage which, from 1998, involved them moving around the world following the wife’s work.

'They owned property, they had homes in a number of countries - England, Singapore and Malaysia...but the jewel in the crown of their assets was the South Kensington apartment, worth £4-£4.75m, never mortgaged, never let out.

'After the marriage broke down...the husband’s centre of interests ceased to be dictated by the wife’s working life'.

Ruling in Mr Choy’s favour, Lady Justice Macur, sitting with Sir Brian Leveson and Lord Justice Aikens, accepted that London had been his ‘permanent and stable’ home in the crucial 12 months before he petitioned for divorce.

The judges backed a family judge’s earlier ruling that an English court was the ‘appropriate forum’ for the warring ex-couple to fight it out over their assets.

During the case, Mr Choy's lawyer said outside court: 'Mr Choy was also a banker, but he quit his job to look after the children and to support his wife in her career.'
