No care: Gloria Foster, 81, was found close to death after being left for nine days without treatment when police closed down the care agency looking after her

A council was warned by police that an 81-year-old woman needed urgent care but failed to act - leading to the woman starving to death in her own home, it has emerged.

Stroke victim Gloria Foster depended on agency nurses who visited her home four times a day for food, water and medication.

But
after the agency was closed down last month – for allegedly employing 
illegal immigrants – her council did nothing to look after her.

It has now emerged that on the day the raids took place, Surrey County Council was given a list of all the agency's clients and contact details by the Metropolitan Police. According to the Daily Telegraph, this included Mrs Foster.

But the council failed to provide any alternative arrangements for the widow's care and she spent nine days alone at home.

When someone eventually went to her 
home, in Banstead, Surrey, on January 24, they found that Mrs Foster had
all but wasted away.

She was severely dehydrated, suffering kidney failure, had serious bed sores and only a faint pulse.

She was taken to Epsom Hospital but died on Monday.

Detectives from Surrey Police are now investigating Mrs Foster's death and have seized her care register as evidence.

She had been receiving help in her own 
home from Carefirst24, but Surrey County Council 
became responsible for her care after a number of its workers were 
arrested last month following a UK Border Agency (UKBA) raid

The care register shows that Mrs Foster last received care on January 15. The nurse wrote that she gave Mrs Foster spaghetti bolognese and fruit juice.

She also wrote that she put on the washing machine and left Mrs Foster watching TV.

Mrs Foster was then found at home on January 24 with her walking frame out of reach in the lounge. The washing which the nurse placed inside the machine was still inside.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Jo Wood, Mrs Foster's god-daughter, said: 'Can you imagine just lying there not being able to move for nine days? It must have been horrific. What happened to her is simply unforgivable.'

Mrs Foster, left, from Banstead, Surrey, depended on nurses for food, water and medication

Her friends have previously said that what happened to her had been ‘appalling’ and demanded answers from Surrey County Council, the local authority responsible for her care.

Ann Penston, from Sutton, said: ‘How on Earth could this have been allowed to happen?

‘How can they just close this thing down and not identify the people they were supposed to be taking care of?

‘She did not deserve to go out like this – in agony with a total feeling of being lost.’

Mrs Foster’s MP, Conservative Crispin Blunt, described her ordeal as ‘horrific’.

He said: ‘Clearly there are questions to answer and I would expect a comprehensive investigation between all of the agencies involved.’

Mrs Foster, a lover of classical music and the theatre who is believed to have worked as a stenographer, had no children. Her husband Bob, an accountant, died in a car crash in Saudi Arabia about 30 years ago.

Worrying: Six people were arrested when police and the UK Border Agency raided Carefirst 24's premises in Cheam, on January 15

She had suffered a stroke and lived alone in the £200,000 house she had owned since 1984.

Private agency Carefirst24 had a 
lucrative contract from the council to look after her.

But the agency 
was suspected of employing illegal immigrants and six people were 
arrested by UK Border Agency officials when its Sutton headquarters was 
raided.

Alternative arrangements should have been made but Mrs Foster did not get any replacement care.

She had no idea the agency had closed
and was unable to call for help.

A district nurse visited her by chance
and found her in a critical condition.

Miss Penston, who had known Mrs 
Foster since the 1980s, said she ‘couldn’t imagine’ how her friend would
have felt after being left alone for nine days.

‘I don’t know how she survived. She 
had a glass of water by her bed.

'I don’t know if she managed to get up 
and get it but my assumption is that for she was just lying there 
waiting for someone to come.’

Paul Burstow, Liberal Democrat MP for
Sutton and Cheam, said the council needed to get to the bottom of why 
its procedures did not work properly.

The UK Border Agency said it had warned the council of plans to shut Carefirst24.

Neighbours and residents condemned the failings that led to Mrs Foster’s death.

A man named Robert posted an internet
message saying: ‘Surrey County Council Social Services should be 
ashamed of themselves. Appalling.’

Disbelief: Ann Penston, a friend of Mrs Foster, holding a picture of the two. She said: 'How on Earth could this have been allowed to happen?'

Forgotten: The woman was left without the four daily nurse visits she needed after Carefirst 24 was shut down by police and the UK Border Agency officers

Another resident said: ‘The way we treat the elderly in this country is disgusting. I hope someone is brought to task.’

All those arrested in the raid on Carefirst24 have been bailed until dates in March.

Two British women aged 48 and 52, a 
52-year-old British man and a 34-year-old Mauritian man were held on 
suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to facilitate foreign 
nationals.

They are alleged to have employed illegal workers using 
former workers’ identities.

Carefirst24 is owned by Mahen 
Caussyram. The company’s website says: ‘Mahen is a family man who takes 
his responsibilities quite seriously. He enjoys spending time at home 
with family and friends.’

Mr Caussyram is a registered nurse 
who ‘developed an interest in human resource management’ and worked as 
an ‘activities coordinator’, the website adds.

A spokesman for the council said: 'This 
is now the subject of a police investigation and it would not be 
appropriate to comment further other than to say we will cooperate 
fully.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
