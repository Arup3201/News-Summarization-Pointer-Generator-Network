Remember Mario Balotelli's camouflaged Bentley? Well, AC Milan midfielder Sulley Muntari has followed in his former team-mate's footsteps with a camoulaged creation of his own.

In a picture posted by Michael Essien on Instagram, the former Chelsea player sits on his Milan team-mates bonnet, showing a Lamborghini with a design very similar to that of Balotelli.

Muntari and Balotelli spent a year in each other's company at AC Milan between 2013-2014, before Balotelli left to join Liverpool, and it seems the latter's taste rubbed off on his colleague.

The Lamborghini is believed to cost between £150,000 and £200,000, an amount that Muntari's €3 million a year contract can easily stretch to.

AC Milan have started the season with two wins, two draws and a loss, and currently sit fifth in Serie A.

Their only loss came against table-topping Juventus, whose 3-2 victory over Roma at the weekend ensured their 100 per cent record so far this season is still intact. 

Muntari scored AC Milan's first goal at the weekend, as they eased past Chievo Verona 2-0.
