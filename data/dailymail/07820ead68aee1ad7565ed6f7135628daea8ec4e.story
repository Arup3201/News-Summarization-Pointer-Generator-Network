Mosque congregations around Britain were given a 'call to action' yesterday to tackle grooming by individuals in the Muslim community - in the week that seven men from a paedophile gang in Oxford were jailed.

A sermon, entitled Tackling Street Grooming in the UK, was made in Friday prayers in around 500 mosques,

It highlighted the responsibilities of Muslims to shun 'all forms of indecent and immoral behaviour' as taught by the Koran.

life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the Old Bailey  

Mohammed Karrar (left), 38, was given life with a
 minimum of 20 years for the 'dreadful offences' he committed against 
the girls. His brother Bassam Karrar (right), 34, was also handed a life
 sentence with a minimum of 15 years

Kamar Jamil (left), 27, was jailed for life with a minimum of 12 years while Assad Hussain (right), 32 was sentenced to seven years in prison

Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child

The move comes after five members of a
 seven-man sadistic paedophile ring found guilty of grooming vulnerable 
underage girls were given life sentences at the Old Bailey. Two other 
defendants were both jailed for seven years.

The midday prayer, called Jummah 
Salah, said: 'Today I will speak to you about the subject of 'Sexual 
Grooming' that has been in the news a lot recently with many cases 
involving mainly men of Pakistani or South Asian background in Derby, 
Rochdale, Telford, Oxford and West Yorkshire who have been convicted of 
this wicked and evil crime.

The sermon states that with 'so many 
individuals from a Muslim background involved in such crimes, we have a 
responsibility to condemn this.

'We wholeheartedly condemn the 
disgraceful actions of those involved in these cases and welcome the 
convictions in the cases that have been through the courts.'

It was said publicity of cases of 
sexual grooming involving Pakistani and South Asian men, and coverage of
 the forthcoming trial of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale on 
charges of killing Lee Rigby would present the Muslim community with a 
'major challenge'.

The sermon, which was part of the 
Together Against Grooming campaign, was unusual because it is often seen
 as a taboo to discuss such topics inside mosques.

The murder of Drummer Lee Rigby by Islamic extremists will create a 'major challenge' for the Muslim community in Britain

But the Muslim groups which support 
the campaign hope that discussing the topic openly may prevent further 
similar instances from happening.

The sermon said: 'We need to continue 
to speak against and oppose this crime and make sure that there is a 
high level of awareness of this issue among our community.

'We need to tackle some of the root 
causes, which are quite often linked to criminality in some sections of 
our community and quite often connected to drugs.

Together Against Grooming spokesman 
Ansar Ali said the campaign was born out a feeling of 'natural 
responsibility' to condemn and tackle sexual grooming.

He said: 'The Koran and traditions of 
our Prophet exhort us to act against evil and injustice, and create just
 societies. This is the start of what will be a nationwide project in 
which we seek to work with others to eradicate this practice from all 
communities.

'The June 28 Together Against Grooming
 campaign is unprecedented - we have brought together mosques and imams 
from all over the UK, irrespective of differences to collectively 
deliver a hard-hitting sermon on a single issue.

'We are united in our stand against sexual grooming and, as Muslims, we are leading the effort to rid society of this crime.'
