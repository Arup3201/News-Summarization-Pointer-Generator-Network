An Ohio woman is accused of shooting her ex-husband in the face at their home on Valentine’s Day.

Hamilton police say Pamela Dawson, 51, has been charged with felonious assault after allegedly shooting 43-year-old Donald Knapp through the nose and mouth just before 10 am on Thursday.

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that neighbors have said that while the couple was divorced, they were living together.

Suspect: Pamela Dawson, 51, is accused of shooting her ex-husband through the nose and mouth on Valentine's Day

Knapp is currently being treated for his injuries at hospital in Cincinnati, while Dawson is being held in Butler County jail.

Reports say that the couple divorced in 2003 after a three-year marriage. According to a recording released by authorities on Friday morning, Knapp's current girlfriend Amy Johnson called 911 for help.

According to the Enquirer, Johnson said she was locked out of the house with her dog, but Knapp came out of the home saying that Dawson had shot him.

On the recording, Johnson tells the operator: 'My boyfriend just got shot in the face!'

'Who shot him?' the dispatcher asks.

According to neighbors, the couple were divorced but continued to share this house in Hamilton where the incident happened

'He came outside and told me she did,' the woman says. 'He came outside screaming and hollering "She shot me in the face! She shot me in the face!" He had blood all over his face.'

Police have not yet released a motive in the attack.

Neighbors in the quiet suburb told Local 12 of their shock at the shooting. Longtime resident Charles Slaughter said that it was 'crazy' and that Dawson 'didn't seem like the type of person would pull the trigger on someone.'
