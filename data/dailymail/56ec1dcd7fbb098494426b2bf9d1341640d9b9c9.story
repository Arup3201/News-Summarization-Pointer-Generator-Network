Large than life: Actor Quinton Aaron, 29, was asked to leave a USAirways flight because another passenger could not sit comfortably next to him

Actor Quinton Aaron, the star of the Oscar-nominated film The Blind Side, was reportedly forced off a US Airways flight Friday because he could not fit into his seat.

The 6-foot-8, 500-pound Aaron told TMZ, which broke the story, that he usually purchases two seats to accommodate his considerable girth, but this time the small plane was fully booked.

The actor boarded Flight 4215 at around 9.30am for a one-hour trip from Philadelphia to Rochester, New York.  

But his journey ended before it even began when a flight attendant came by and politely asked him to disembark.

According to the 29-year-old actor, a passenger who booked the seat next to his was unable to squeeze himself past Aaron's full figure.

Aaron said he attempted to reason with the cabin crew, but to no avail.

Upon leaving the plane, The Blind Side star booked another flight, where he was able to purchase two seats for himself.

'I definitely need two seats,’ he told TMZ. ‘It worked out for the better … my knees weren’t pushed into the back of the metal on someone else’s seat.'

Flight 4215 from Philadelphia to Rochester was a narrow, 50-seat aircraft known as De Havilland DHC-8-300 model manufactured by Bombardier.

According to the site SeatGuru.com, none of the seats on the economy-class plane recline.

Aaron, a native of The Bronx, New York, is best known for his role as football player Michael Oher opposite Sandra Bullock in the 2009 film The Blind side, which was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Picture category.

Last year, he appeared in the film 1982 with Wayne Brady, and he is currently attached to nearly a dozen film projects, according to his IMDB page.

In 2012, Aaron started The Quinton Aaron Foundation to raise awareness of bullying and childhood obesity. The non-profit organization also provides assistance to children in need.

In a brief phone interview with MailOnline Friday afternoon, US Airways spokesperson Michelle Mohr declined to confirm the alleged incident citing passenger privacy. 

The airline's website makes no explicit mention of a seating policy that would require a passenger to leave a plane if he or she cannot fit into a seat without preventing other travelers from sitting comfortably.

However, Miss Mohr noted that the airline is committed to ensuring a safe and comfortable journey for all their customers.

If passengers require additional space, Mohr added, a flight crew would make every effort to 'work with them' and accommodate their needs.

'If all the seats are sold out, we do need to accommodate the person on another flight,' the airline representative said.
