Swimmers at one of Australia’s most famous beaches were in shock this morning after a 2.5 metre great white shark was  caught in nets at Bondi Beach.

The shark is thought to have died in the nets and was picked up by a contractor boat on behalf of the Fisheries department at around 11.30 am on Wednesday. 

It was taken from Bondi to the Fisheries wharf in Sydney harbour where it was unloaded into a container to be taken for testing and an autopsy.

Photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark, hung from its mouth, being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high-vis jackets at the wharf.

A spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries told Daily Mail Australia: ‘A male great white shark of approximately 2.5m in length was found in a shark net off Bondi Beach.’ 

‘The shark was found during routine inspections by specialist contractors who carry out operations as part of the NSW Shark Meshing Program,’ the Department confirmed.

‘DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes, as is practice for some sharks caught in our shark nets as part of national and international research projects. This will be carried out by DPI research staff.’ 

Witness Nick Wenham told Daily Mail Australia: ‘It was definitely from Bondi beach. It's a 2.5-3m great white that needed to be taken to the Fisheries for testing because it's a protected species.'

‘It was dead with its tail removed. We followed the boat from Bradley's head in the harbour up to the fisheries where I took the pictures.

‘The shark went into the container behind and they shut the doors as soon as it was in,’ Mr Wenham added. 

'The tail was on the back deck,' he pointed out.

Michael Kennedy, director of the Humane Society International Australia, said shark nets ‘are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out’.

'DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes,' a Department spokesperson said

‘In theory if it is alive they are supposed to release them but if it died it should be used for research so it didn’t die in vain,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Groups like ours are totally opposed to shark nets … research recognises that they are a key threat to a whole range of species… but they are scared of what would happen if they are remove the nets,’ Mr Kennedy said.

‘Even people whose sons and parents have been killed in the surf don’t want revenge killings … I think that is the attitude today in Australia.'

Shark nets are on 51 beaches in New South Wales and are maintained by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries.

The nets are generally 150 metres long and 6m wide and can be established 500 metres from the beach.

‘The program protects around two million people who swim at these beaches each year,’ a Department spokesperson said.

‘The nets do not stretch from one end of a beach to the other. They are not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks. They are designed to deter sharks from establishing territories, thereby reducing the odds of a shark encounter,’ they added.
