However, Blues Mourinho has revealed that he will prioritise winning over remaining undefeated as Chelsea go in search of trophies.

He said: 'One thing is that I don't think it's possible (to complete a season unbeaten). The other thing is that we are not playing for that.

'If (against Spurs) we have a 0-0 with 20 minutes to go, we are not going to play for the 0-0 to be undefeated after 21 matches. No way.

'If you play for that, if that is one objective, maybe you draw so many matches, you don't take risks to try and win matches. You are happy just to be undefeated.'
