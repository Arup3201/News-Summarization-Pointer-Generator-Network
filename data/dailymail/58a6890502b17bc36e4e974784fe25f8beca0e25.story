Ryanair was yesterday accused of spoiling passengers’ holidays by  hitting them with ‘sneaky’ and often huge charges at the airport.

Mother-of-two Suzy McLeod had to pay £236 just to print out boarding passes for her family so they could return home.

The 35-year-old was backed by more than 350,000 people on Facebook after complaining of her ‘unfair’ treatment.

Hit with charges: Suzy McLeod, pictured with her children Harry and Mary, was charged £236 by Ryanair after she forgot to print her family's boarding cards

An Army officer, who has served in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, told how he ended up leaving behind £44 worth of 
gifts for his three children after being told it would cost £50 for a 
second item of hand luggage.

The 50-year-old’s plea that he was on a surprise trip to France to join them for a rare family holiday failed to move staff.

Mrs McLeod, of Newbury, Berkshire, 
fell foul of Ryanair’s rule that travellers print their own boarding 
passes up to two weeks before flying. Because her family was in Spain 
over 15 days from August 1, she was unable to do this. She did, 
however,  have the passes on her phone as pdf documents.

Ryanair rant: The mother says that she was unable to print her boarding passes as she left the country before she was allowed to access them online

Print or pay: The airline say that their terms and conditions make it clear there is a penalty for reissuing passes

At Alicante airport, she was charged 
60 euros each, a total of 300 euros (£236) to print out five passes for 
herself, her parents and children, Harrison, ten, and Mary, three.

The 
soldier who had to abandon presents he had bought at Hamleys in 
Stansted’s departure area said: ‘What annoyed me was that they were 
letting people board with far bigger hand baggage than mine.

‘Does it really cost £50 to carry a plastic bag filled with toys? It’s very sneaky.’

The whereabouts of the toys, including cars and dinosaurs, is not known.

Ryanair is known for one of the most strictly enforced baggage policies in the industry.

It insists all of its charges are detailed in terms and conditions on booking.
