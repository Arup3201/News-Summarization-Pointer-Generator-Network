Ryan LaFlare will put his undefeated record on the line against crafty veteran Demian Maia this Saturday at UFC Fight Night 62. 

It will be his toughest test to date and a chance to prove he's a real title threat. Unlike many fighters currently competing in the UFC, including guys like Jon Jones and Demetrious Johnson, LaFlare has never tasted professional defeat. 

Here is our pick of the best unbeaten fighters right now.

Ryan LaFlare will be hoping to make it 12 from 12 when he takes on Demian Maia at UFC Fight Night 62

1. Ronda Rousey - It's difficult to imagine a world where Rousey is not undefeated. So long as the champ's focus remains on MMA and not becoming the next Audrey Hepburn, her Octagon success should only continue to flourish.

And yes, that includes a potential showdown with Cristiane 'Cyborg' Justino's heavy artillery.

Ronda Rousey can keep her unbeaten UFC record going unless her attention is taken by acting

2. Chris Weidman - At this point in his career, having capped off two victories over Anderson Silva with an impeccable title defense over Lyoto Machida at UFC 175, there's no denying how good UFC middleweight kingpin Weidman truly is. 

When healthy, Weidman is a pound-for-pound force who is arguably the most complete champion in the sport today. Vitor Belfort, Luke Rockhold, the winner of Ronaldo Souza vs. Yoel Romero and possibly Machida stand in Weidman's way from securing one of the most impressive Octagon runs of all time.

3. Khabib Nurmagomedov - Aka The Eagle, aka Mr. Funny Hat, aka Last Guy to Beat Rafael Dos Anjos, is MMA's Red Star. Equipped with some of the best wrestling the lightweight division has ever seen, the 26-year-old combines power and tenacity to pulverize his opponents. 

With victories over current divisional champ Dos Anjos, veterans Gleison Tibau and Pat Healy and the hard-hitting Abel Trujillo, the Russian's 26-0 record is gaining quite the accolades.

4. Joanna Jedrzejczyk - There's something about the current UFC women's strawweight champion that suggests she'll be the division's titleholder for a very long time. 

She's young, lean, athletic and cocky enough to keep even the most casual of fight fans interested in a 115-pound female. Undefeated at 9-0, the Polish Princess has dissected her opponents with unparalleled striking consisting of perfectly timed combinations, body strikes and suffocating pressure.

Joanna Jedrzejczyk remains undefeated in nine fights and doesn't look like being beaten any time soon

5. Paul Felder – The UFC lightweight Felder has come out of nowhere. Unranked and undefeated, the Irish Dragon is quietly flying under the radar coming into his fight with Jim Miller at UFC on Fox 15. 

But with versatile striking, knockout power and budding grappling skills, Felder will ultimately force his way into the limelight.

6. Bethe Correia - It's unlikely that she has what it takes to defeat champion Rousey. Even with the best power punching in the women's bantamweight division, the confident Brazilian has struggled to maintain the composure and patience it would take to win the title. 

Her resume certainly commands respect, but it only took Rousey 16 seconds in a recent title defense opposite Cat Zingano to beat a contender with the same 9-0 record.

7. Ryan LaFlare - Even with a record of 11-0 (4-0 in the UFC), rising welterweight LaFlare has yet to earn undivided respect. Due in part to his inability to capture a Octagon finish thus far, the wrestling-based 31-year-old needs to show a little 'flair' to make noise in a talent-rich division. 

But with an excellent ground game and budding striking skills, the New Yorker slightly resembles a less accomplished Weidman.

The jury is still out over LaFlare, especially since he has not managed an Octagon finish so far in his career
