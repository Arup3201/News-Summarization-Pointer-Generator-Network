A group of divers has had a thrilling encounter with a gigantic Mola mola fish in the crystal blue waters off the coast of Malta.

With the appearance of an underwater blimp, the fascinating Mola mola, also known as an ocean sunfish, dwarfs the humans as they swim around it and capture the moment on video.

Diver Erik van der Goot, who posted the close-up footage on YouTube, said the ‘once-in-a-lifetime experience’ occurred near Wied il-Mielah off the island of Gozo.

Like a floating blob: Mola mola are docile creatures that have been known to weigh as much as 5,000 pounds

Erik said the group bumped into the bizarre-looking fish at a depth of around 15 metres and had a difficult time keeping up with it.

The underwater video shows just how massive and unusual the creature is, as it resembles a floating blob while cutting through the Mediterranean Sea. 

Mola mola are docile creatures that have been known to weigh as much as 5,000 pounds, and they are unable to fully close their mouths.

Found in temperate and tropical waters, they are the heaviest of all the bony fish and have been measured at 14ft in height and 10ft in length.
