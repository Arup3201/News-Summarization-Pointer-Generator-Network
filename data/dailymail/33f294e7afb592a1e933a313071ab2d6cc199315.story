Max Clifford has today vowed to clear his name following his arrest on suspicion of sexual offences by police investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal.

The PR guru told the press outside his Surrey home that the accusations are 'absolutely without foundation' and said he had spent 12 hours in a cell and being questioned.

He said: 'It's a horrible experience but you have to face up to these things. They (the allegations) are totally without foundation and totally untrue.

'I
was there for about 12 hours hours sitting in cells, asked questions 
for hours and hours, so I wasn't exactly a bundle of joy.

At the centre of his own media scrum: The publicist spoke to press about his arrest and said the allegations were untrue

'But I came out and faced the cameras and spoke to everybody (the press) because I've got absolutely nothing to hide.

The noted publicist spent most of 
yesterday in a central London police station as officers searched his 
£3million mansion in Surrey and his London office.

The 69-year-old said that he would be trying to make life 'as normal as I possibly can' and said he was still intent on speaking at different charitable events.

'It was a horrible thing to happen to anybody, but I'm old enough and ugly enough to know that I should face it and sort it out.

'The accusations have been made, the police have to look at it, that's what they have to do.

'I have to answer their questions and hopefully show clearly and conclusively to them and everybody else that there's absolutely no truth in any of this.'

The publicist said that one allegations dates back to 1977, and another to a few years afterwards.

He was bailed to appear at a date later this month.

Leaving Belgravia police station in 
central London last night, he said: 'These allegations are damaging and 
totally untrue. On a personal level they are very distressing for 
myself, my wife, my family and loved ones.

'Anyone who really knew me all those 
years ago and those who have known me since will have no doubt that I 
would never act in the way that I have today been accused. I have 
nothing more to add.'

Asked when the allegations dated from, he replied: '1977, 35 years.’

He later confirmed there were two allegations, although it is not known whether they relate to two different people.

Sources close to Clifford said he was confident he had nothing to worry about.

He is the fifth suspect to be arrested – and sixth person to be questioned – in connection with Operation Yewtree, the police inquiry set up after late Top Of The Pops presenter Savile was exposed as a serial abuser.

There are three strands to the Yewtree 
operation – two involving Savile, and a third termed ‘Others’. Clifford 
falls into this third category, meaning he was not being questioned 
about anything connected to Savile.

He was arrested in a low-key 
operation at 7.40am, when two unmarked police cars and two white transit
vans arrived at his three-storey home on an exclusive gated estate in 
the Surrey stockbroker belt.

Held on suspicion of sexual offences, Clifford said the allegations date back to 1977

Later, officers could be seen putting black bags believed to contain items from his house into the back of the vans, while flashes at the large windows suggested officers were taking photographs inside.

A neighbour who saw the cars arrive said: ‘The arrest has come as a massive shock, as he is well respected in the community. The allegations are totally out of character.’

Clifford has been a vocal commentator on the Savile scandal, and last month said a lot of old stars were worried about being dragged into the investigation because they had appeared on Top Of The Pops or Jim’ll Fix It and had merely posed for photographs with girls and Savile.

Former clients include:

Reality TV star Rebecca Loos

Former Harrods' owner Mohamad Al-Fayed

Singer Cheryl Cole

Late reality star Jade Goody

Music mogul Simon Cowell

Singer Kerry Katona

‘It is a situation which could easily
turn into a witch-hunt; a lot of big stars are frightened,’ he told 
ITV’s Daybreak. ‘Where is it going to end? I hope they (the police) 
concentrate on finding people like Jimmy Savile who were manipulating 
girls.’

He claimed at least 15 big-name stars
from the 1960s and 70s had contacted him because they had lived a 
hedonistic lifestyle where young girls threw themselves at them but they
‘never asked for anybody’s birth certificate’.

Clifford has been in the business of 
representing the rich and famous for 40 years, his website boasts, and 
he is considered to be almost as famous as those he represents.

Clifford’s first wife, Liz, died of 
cancer in 2003 and he remarried, to his former PA Jo Westwood, in 2010. 
There was no sign of her yesterday. Clifford has one daughter from his 
first marriage, Louise, 41.

He is the sixth suspect to be 
questioned. Singer Gary Glitter and comedian Freddie Starr have 
previously been arrested and bailed under Operation Yewtree in the 
strand classed ‘Savile and others’.

DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 
70s were arrested and bailed in November as part of the operation strand
classed as ‘Others’.

A man in his 80s from Berkshire was interviewed under caution on suspicion of sexual offences not directly related to Savile.

All deny any wrongdoing.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said:
‘Officers working on Operation Yewtree have this morning arrested a man
in his 60s in connection with the investigation. The man from Surrey 
was arrested at 7.40am on suspicion of sexual offences and has been 
taken into a central London police station.

Arrest: Police outside the home of PR guru, Max Clifford, 69, on Thursday

Police searched the home of PR guru Max Clifford after he was arrested Thursday morning

Mr Clifford is scheduled to host a black tie charity dinner in aid of a children's charity next week.

The
£90-a-head do, called 'Max Clifford reveals the secrets of the rich and
famous', is scheduled to take place at the luxurious five-star 
Pennyhill Park Hotel and Spa in Bagshot, Surrey, next Monday in aid of 
the Caudwell Children's Charity and the Help Numan Walk Appeal.

The self-styled PR guru has been in 
the business of representing the rich and famous for 40 years, his 
website boasts, and he is considered to be almost as famous as those he 
represents.

He was catapulted into the public eye in 1986, when he invented a story about one of his clients, Freddie Starr - who has also been arrested as part of Operation Yewtree - telling journalists that the comic had eaten a woman's hamster.

He then provided a response to the claims which created another story - garnering the comedian attention for his then upcoming tour - and later admitted it was a fabrication.

His former clients range from multimillionaires to reality television stars fresh out of their programmes.

Mr Clifford is the sixth suspect to be questioned after one man, in his 80s and from Berkshire, was interviewed under caution on suspicion of sexual offences.

The man in his 80s was treated as part of the investigation that does not 
directly relate to Savile’s offences.

He was interviewed under caution on suspicion of sexual offences for five hours by 
officers working on Operation Yewtree and police searched a Berkshire property on Saturday, November 24.

Six arrests had been 
made as part of national investigation Operation Yewtree, into
alleged sexual offences by Savile and others.

Gary Glitter and comedian Freddie 
Starr were arrested and bailed under Operation Yewtree in the strand 
classed 'Savile and others'.

DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s were arrested and bailed in November as
part of the operation strand classed as 'others'.

All deny any wrongdoing.

Scotland
Yard is leading the inquiry and has said officers are currently dealing
with around 450 potential victims, the vast majority of whom claim they
fell prey to Savile.

Last month the force said it was dealing with around 450 potential victims, the vast majority of whom claimed they had fallen prey to Savile.

Officers are looking at three strands within their inquiry: claims against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others.
