The married chief executive of the Co-op Bank has been conducting a secret affair with a colleague 11 years his junior – threatening to plunge the troubled institution into a new crisis.

Niall Booker, 55, the Co-op’s £2.9 million-a-year boss, was last night warned he may have to resign over the affair. His lover, Samantha Davenport, is the bank’s ‘Talent Director’ who plays a key role in selecting the very board members – and chairman – who are supposed to hold him to account.

The affair, which began in February, will cause friction at the highest levels of the ‘ethical’ bank as it tries to recover from the double blow of its near financial collapse and the drugs and sex scandal of former chairman Paul Flowers, exposed by The Mail on Sunday last year.

Lovers: Co-op Bank chief Niall Booker and fellow executive Samantha Davenport

Mr Booker and Ms Davenport are believed to have carried on their relationship in Manchester, home of the Co-op’s HQ, and in London, where they both live, and it is now an ‘open secret’ among colleagues.

Ms Davenport, who is No 2 in the Co-op’s human resources department, is understood to command a salary well into six figures. She has previously headed recruitment at Lloyds and Barclays banks. A Co-op spokesman confirmed she plays a role in selecting not only the board members but also the chairman.

Last Friday, Mr Booker who recently left his wife Valerie, was seen hand-in-hand with his lover after they emerged from Ms Davenport’s West London home, having apparently skipped work for the morning. It is understood that the blonde mother of three is divorced.

While their colleagues were at work, they were seen emerging just after 2.30pm from the £850,000 Hammersmith townhouse where she lives with her three children aged 11, ten and seven.

It is just a 20-minute drive from Mr Booker’s £3.5 million marital home in fashionable Primrose Hill. Holding hands like lovelorn teenagers, they hailed a black cab and headed across London to the Co-op office near St Paul’s Cathedral.

Even in flat heels, the statuesque Ms Davenport is several inches taller than balding, portly Mr Booker, and at one point she put an arm around his shoulders while he held her waist.

Last night, the bank’s chairman Richard Pym refused to answer The Mail on Sunday’s questions, but issued a statement saying only: ‘Niall is doing a fantastic job.’

The revelation of the affair comes just weeks before the Co-op stages a multi-million-pound relaunch of its ethical ‘core values’ with a TV and billboard advertising campaign.

Ironically, father-of-two Mr Booker – hired to save the bank – recently bemoaned the fact that 300 savers a day deserted it in the first six months of this year due to the ‘hurricane of negative publicity’.

Presenting a survey of 73,000 customers’ views, he announced: ‘Values and ethics sit at the very heart of the Co-operative Bank and are what makes us different.’

In an article for The Guardian, he even compared himself to the famous fictional bank manager of Walmington-on-Sea, declaring: ‘At a time when the BBC is bringing back Dad’s Army, Captain Mainwaring… should make a return to banking.’

But staff at the Co-op fear Mr Booker’s conduct is in breach of its ‘code of governance’ because of the particular recruitment role played by Ms Davenport.

The head-hunter is currently actively involved in selecting candidates to succeed the bank’s retiring chairman Richard Pym – Mr Booker’s boss, and the successor to disastrous ‘Crystal Methodist’ Paul Flowers.

She has also drawn up shortlists for several other seats on the board, whose members will now face mounting pressure to show they are willing to hold senior executives to account on their personal conduct and that the bank’s ethics are not just a veneer.

On its website, the bank declares that the chief executive is expected to: ‘Demonstrate ethical leadership and promote the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance throughout the Bank.’

Last night, senior Tory MP Brian Binley – himself a former Co-op Bank clerk – warned Mr Booker might have to resign. He said: ‘If these reports are correct, at the very least, Mr Booker should explain himself to the Co-op board. If he cannot do so satisfactorily, he may have to consider his position.’

The MP added that when he was a clerk, he had been proud to work for a ‘very ethically correct operation’, but was ‘deeply saddened’ over recent events at the bank.

Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso, a member of the Commons Treasury Committee, said: ‘Impeccable corporate governance is imperative at the Co-op Bank. Anything other than that would be wholly unacceptable.’ A Co-op spokesman said: ‘Niall Booker had previously advised the company of the situation and appropriate steps are being taken to manage any potential conflict of interest.’

While the bank tried to play down the significance of Ms Davenport’s role in the recruitment of directors and the chairman, a source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She reviews applications, screens candidates and conducts first interviews. She also manages regulatory approval and makes the offer and negotiates the packages they are offered.’ The scandal is just the latest crisis to hit the ailing Co-op – which has bankrolled the Labour Party in the past.

The bank’s troubles stem from its takeover of Britannia Building Society in 2009 which, along with other poor decisions, landed it with £1.9 billion black hole in its finances.

The shortfall scuppered its plans to take over 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group and prompted scrutiny from City regulators.

Under questioning by MPs the bank’s former chairman Paul Flowers displayed startling ignorance of its affairs, a scandal compounded when The Mail on Sunday revealed he had been using hard drugs and hiring rent boys.

Last year the bank’s owner, Co-operative Group, was forced to hand over control to creditors to help wipe out its debts. Co-op Group now owns just 20 per cent of the bank. Mr Booker was parachuted in last June as part of a new team assembled by Co-op Group boss Euan Sutherland, who in turn quit in March this year after details of his £6.6 million two-year pay deal were leaked.

Mr Booker’s own salary is £1.2 million, but he pockets a further £1.7 million a year ‘retention’ as long as the bank meets modest targets. But Mr Booker, a career banker who has worked in the Middle East, India and the United States, is said by insiders to have little truck with the Co-op’s ethical ethos which prevents it investing in the arms trade or the tobacco industry.

‘He’s only interested in the money,’ said one source. ‘He views the traditional values of the Co-op with ill-disguised contempt.’

Former HSBC executive Mr Booker is estranged from his wife and lawyers have been consulted over divorce proceedings, according to a source.

An embarrassing conflict of interests that sets alarm bells ringing... AGAIN

COMMENT by SIMON WATKINS, CITY EDITOR 

The Co-operative Bank has once again been embarrassed by the private life of a senior director.

Niall Booker’s relationship with a senior colleague has apparently been an open secret at the bank – the subject of whispering in executive corridors.

His relationship raises obvious questions about governance. Samantha Davenport, as ‘Talent Director’, plays a role in recruiting senior figures.

Values: Mr Booker was hired to save the troubled bank that is proud of its ethics

The bank says it is taking steps to address any potential conflict of interest. This is quite right, though it does of course confirm that such conflicts could exist.

Co-op Bank is only just dragging itself back from near financial collapse – and struggling to recover from the scandal of its drug-taking former chairman Paul Flowers.

The bank’s finances stabilised, but only after its former owner, Co-operative Group, was forced to hand control to creditors including a clutch of US hedge funds. But Co-op Bank still lost £76 million in the first half of this year, Booker himself admitted it was still losing customers thanks to its tarnished reputation.

Meanwhile, as recently as last week, Booker and Davenport were indulging their relationship during what most people might regard as office hours.

Former HSBC man Booker is one of a number of experienced City figures who have joined the Co-op Bank or the Co-op Group, as part of a bid to refresh both organisations. It has proved a tricky place for many of them.

Booker has already faced scrutiny over his pay package, which at £2.9 million was seen as at odds with the Co-op ethos.

Euan Sutherland quit as chief executive at Co-op Group earlier this year, partly in anger at the way his £6.6 million two-year pay deal had been leaked, but also enraged by the amateurish and bitter politicking culture.

Booker’s affair with a colleague and his potential distraction from the serious job in hand would raise questions at any company. At the Co-op Bank, struggling to shake off financial crisis and recover its reputation for probity and ethics, it should set alarm bells ringing.
