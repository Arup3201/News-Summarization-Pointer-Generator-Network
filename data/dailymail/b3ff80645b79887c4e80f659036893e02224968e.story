Fearne Cotton is a mother, presenter and charity ambassador who just tied to knot to long-term rocker boyfriend Jesse Wood. Oh, and she's managed to find the time to design her fifteenth fashion range for Very.co.uk too.

The 33-year-old, known for her edgy and trendy style, has unveiled and modelled her AW14 midseason collection, which is available now. 

Fearne has come a long way from the days of being London’s premier party presenter and in her new campaign shots, she’s every inch the yummy mummy,  with her hair cut into a choppy blonde bob and her eyes enhanced with her signature flick of jet black eyeliner.

New shoot: Fearne Cotton, 33, has designed and modelled her fifteenth collection for e-tailer Very - and her AW14 range is all about channelling the 60s 

The Celebrity Juice presenter exudes glamour and London cool as she poses in the edgy shoot, which has a 60s theme and was shot in the streets of the capital.

Fearne, who has been designing for the brand since 2009, said of her range: 'My collection is all about having fun with your clothes - dressing in a way that makes you feel empowered and your best.'

Big hair, don't care: Fearne channels Kate Moss with bed hair, ankle boots and a blue plaid coat from her collection, which is online now

Cosy knits: Fearne's mid-season range is full of PVC shorts, leathers and chunky cable knit jumper that will take you through to autumn in style

A spokesperson for Very.co.uk added that Fearne's collections are always looked forward to by their customers.

'At Very we pride ourselves on helping our customer lead a stylish life, and one of the ways we achieve this is by giving access to exclusively designed collections at great prices.

'Fearne's collection is always eagerly anticipated and we are expecting this season to be another huge success.'

The busy mother has already designed and given fans a sneak peek of her SS15 collection for the e-tailer.

While it doesn't launch online until January 13, fashion aficionados were treated to a first glimpse of the clothes at her LFW showcase earlier this month.

The range will be the blonde's sixteenth collection for the online store and takes inspiration from the circus.

Looking good: Fearne looks slender with her hair cut into a choppy blonde bob and her eyes enhanced with flicks of jet black eyeliner - her signature look

Busy bee: As well as launching her latest range, presenting on Radio 1 and tying the knot, Fearne recently started filming the new series of Celebrity Juice with Keith Lemon

Fearne  seemed more than happy to be spending extra time with husband Jesse Wood by bringing him to work with her last Tuesday morning.

The couple looked deep in conversation as they approached central London's Broadcasting House, home to BBC Radio 1, where she hosts her weekday show.

The couple, parents to one-year-old Rex, must have been grateful for the break from their young child.

Fearne recently posted a picture on Instagram captioned: '5:45am mum hair' clearly having been woken up by her son. 

The blonde star, who is a keen baker, is soon to compete in a Great British Bake-Off style contest in aid of Children In Need.

The cake fan will be baking her favourite carrot cake in a bid to beat stars such as fellow BBC Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw and Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daly.
