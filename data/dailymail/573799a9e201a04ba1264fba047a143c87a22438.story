A homeowner is so desperate to shift his decrepit house in Detroit that he's willing to swap it for an iPhone 6.

The property, a two-story, three-bedroom home, is falling apart, and has been stuck on the market for four months.

Even with an asking price of just $3,000, the property sparked so little interest that the unnamed owner said he would give it to anybody who'll hand over one of Apple's latest smartphones.

Unusual offer: The Austrian man who owns this house in Detroit has said he'll trade it for an iPhone 6

The desperate owner - who lives in Austria and has never been to the stricken house - would even be willing to part with it for a 32GB iPad, Fox News reported.

He man bought his house in 2010 for around $40,000, hoping to turn a quick profit - but even at that price he was overpaying, and has never seen a return.

All the while the property has been accruing backtaxes, which now stand at $6,000 and would have to be paid back by anybody who took over the home.

The house boasts three bedrooms, a bathroom, a basement and a garage, and a location just 20 minutes out of downtown Detroit.

But it is currently uninhabitable, with smashed up windows, broken shutters and furniture and overgrown plants strewn in front of it.

Damaged: The house spent four months on the market, and even at a price of $3,000 drew no interest

Uninhabitable: Anybody who bought the property would have some serious work to do - and $6,000 of backtaxes to pay

Real estate agent Larry Else is selling the property, and explained the bizarre offer.

He said: 'My client is overseas and he told me he would be willing to trade the properly for an iPhone 6. It sounds to me like he wants the (iPhone 6+) version, but I think he's willing to negotiate.'

Speaking to Buzzfeed about the property, he admitted that it's 'in terrible condition and needs major work.'

He said: 'It’s not anywhere near move-in ready. The area is also filled with similar houses, mostly vacant.'

He also described the neighborhood as 'dicey'. 

Regardless, offers have reportedly started pouring in - one from somebody who lives just down the street, and another who said she would pay the iPhone price just for the wood the house is made of. 

Object of desire: The man has said he will settle for the latest Apple gadget - or even a 32GB iPad
