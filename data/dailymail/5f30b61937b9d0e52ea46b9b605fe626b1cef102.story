Andre Schurrle's move to Wolfsburg continues to gather pace as the forward will have a medical at the club on Friday.

Andre Schurrle will have a medical at Wolfsburg on Friday ahead of a proposed  transfer from Chelsea

Wolfsburg have yet to agree a fee with Chelsea over the German international but hope to do so on Friday 

The 24-year-old has seen his opportunities limited this season, having started just five Premier League games

Wolsfburg have offered £21million up front plus add-ons that could see the transfer rise to £27m.

Chelsea feel the offer is below their desired fee for Schurrle - who joined for £18m from Bayer Leverkusen in 2013.

Germany World Cup winner Schurrle has seen his opportunities limited this season, having started just five Premier League games.

His last appereance for the Blues came as a late subsitute in their 5-0 Premier League win at Swansea on January 17.

Elsewhere, Wolfsburg have sent striker Ivica Olic to Hamburg on a permanent deal.

The 35-year-old was one of the club's biggest earners and his move will help free funds for the Schurrle deal.
