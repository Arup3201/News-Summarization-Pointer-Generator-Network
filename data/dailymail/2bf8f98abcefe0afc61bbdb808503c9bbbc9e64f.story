Former Chelsea striker Mikael Forssell faced a last-minute dash to training after revealing that he had been held by by a cat sitting next to his car. 

The 33-year-old VfL Bochum striker, who also had spells at Crystal Palace, Birmingham and Leeds, is allergic to cats, and claimed he couldn't get into his car because a cat was sitting next to it.

The Finn waited in the safety of his house, watching the feline threat for 20 minutes.

Forssell then tweeted a picture of beast, saying: 'I'm allergic to cats. I need 2 leave 2 training...semi-scary...been there now 4 about 20mins rubbing against my rubber.' 

The Finnish striker spent a decade in English football between 1998 and 2008 with Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Birmingham, scoring over 50 league goals.

After a three-year spell in Germany with Hannover in the Bundesliga, he returned to England with Leeds in 2011, but was scoreless in 15 appearances. 

Forssell, who has 29 goals in 86 games for Finland, has scored one goal in six appearances this season.
