Small firms were yesterday given a £2.5billion tax break on business rates in a desperate bid to stop empty shops blighting ailing High Streets.

The Chancellor put the tax at the centre of his Autumn Statement as part of a six-pronged attempt to ease the financial burden on smaller enterprises.

George Osborne said business rates ‘impose a heavy burden on businesses of all sizes’, but he was determined to fill the vacant shops.

Small firms were yesterday given a £2.5billion tax break on business rates in a desperate bid to stop empty shops blighting ailing High Streets

More than 22,000 of the nation’s shops are lying empty, a wasteland equivalent to 23 city centres the size of Sheffield.

Under the changes:

A discount of up to £1,000 a year for small retail businesses, such as pubs, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, and charity shops, on their business rates bills. Not all shops will be eligible, with exclusions such as high-street betting shops and payday lenders. The discount will be available for the next two years.

Firms will be allowed to spread their business rate payments over 12 months, rather than ten months, to spread the financial burden to help their cashflow.

Simon Tivey, of Pricewaterhouse Coopers, said the Chancellor must beware that the changes do not just trigger ‘a merry-go-round of rate relief relocations’.

A shop could, in theory, move from one empty premises to another to benefit from the discount.

He also said it could lead to ‘a proliferation of charity shops’ because of the huge discounts of 80 per cent that they already get, with the prospect of a further £1,000 on top.

John Longworth, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said relentless increases in business rates have ‘sucked the life out of businesses in all parts of the UK.’

He said: ‘The Chancellor should have been bolder, freezing business rates entirely until this pernicious tax can be properly reformed.’

Liz Peace, of the British Property Federation, said: ‘The business rates regime remains one of the greatest barriers to investment in the built environment, and is fundamentally unfit for the 21st century.’

Funding will now come from the companies themselves, rather than from training providers.

Steve Radley, director of policy at the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, said: 'Businesses have long been calling for a revolution in how apprenticeships are funded, and today their calls have been heard.’

Business owner Olivia Knight could save hundreds of pounds a year in the long term when employers’ National Insurance contributions for workers under 21 are scrapped.

She also believes new incentives for businesses to take over empty shops could help revitalise Britain’s ailing high streets.

The 35-year-old has two full-time members of staff and is hoping to expand her present-buying company by taking on more.

She will now seriously consider hiring younger workers to take advantage of the new incentive.

Miss Knight’s company, Patchwork Present, is an online business with a shop in Brockley, South East London.

If she takes on someone under 21 on a salary of £12,000, under the new rules she could save £500 a year in NI contributions.

She said: ‘This could certainly help us in the future as we grow as I would certainly like to employ more young people. But she says she could only take them on if they have the right abilities.

‘If you’re a start-up company, our few workers need to have a range of skills and quite a lot of experience in order to cope with the stresses,’ she said.

Patchwork Present was set up three months ago. It works by one person asking for a big present and friends and family donating small or large amounts of money to reach the total cost.

Miss Knight also praised Mr Osborne’s plan to offer businesses who take over an empty shop a 50 per cent relief from business rates.

She said: ‘I have just taken over an empty shop which was going to waste and the council said I wouldn’t have to pay any rates at all.

The fact something like this is being introduced nationally is a great idea. Up and down the country, tragically, the High Street is changing and there are tons of empty shops where we live in South East London.

‘This is great for the community as if businesses can take over then the high streets can thrive.’

Expensive council houses will be sold off to pay for new, affordable homes.

Local authorities will be urged to get rid of high-value, vacant properties. The proceeds will go to giving councils an extra £300million to borrow to build 10,000 new, affordable homes and regenerate rundown estates.

Council tenants who want to move home so they can be closer to work will also get help.

George Osborne said: ‘We want to regenerate some of our most rundown urban housing estates. Councils will sell off the most expensive social housing, so they can house many more families for the same money.’

He added: ‘We are going to give working people in social housing a priority right to move if they need to for a job.’

Local Government Association chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said councils had lobbied for the removal of the borrowing cap. ‘The easing of restrictions on housing investment does not go as far as we would like, but it does show that our call for more local flexibility to drive economic growth has been recognised.’

The Chancellor also announced £1billion worth of loans to developers ‘to unblock large housing developments on sites in Manchester and Leeds and across the country’.

Universities in England will be allowed to recruit as many students as they want from 2015, the Chancellor announced yesterday.

The Government is axing the limit on places, which means institutions will be able to expand without incurring fines.

The overhaul will be funded through the sale of more student debt to private companies, amounting to £5.5billion over five years. This will fund students’ maintenance and tuition fee loans.

George Osborne said the move was necessary as around 60,000 young people with the grades to study for a degree miss out on places every year due to an ‘arbitrary cap’.

He added: ‘That makes no sense when we have a far lower proportion of people going to university than even the United States, let alone countries like South Korea.’

Universities Minister David Willetts said: ‘Removing the student numbers cap will free universities to recruit the students they want and give people far more choice over where to study.’

But Universities UK chief executive Nicola Dandridge said: ‘We will need to understand how this is sustainable in the long term, given that this policy is being funded in coming years by the asset sales.’ Professor Michael Gunn, chairman of the million+ think tank, said universities and students will want to know that the plans really do ‘add up’.

A business which moves into the premises of an empty retail shop, which has been vacant for more than a year, will be eligible for a 50 per cent rates discount for 18 months. To get the discount, businesses have to move in between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016.

Small business rates relief, which was 
due to end next spring, will be extended for a further 12 months until 
April 2015, benefiting 540,000 small firms. This allows small firms with
 a rateable value of up to £6,000 to pay no business rates, and cuts 
bills for larger firms with a rateable value of up to £12,000. 
Beneficiaries of this relief will be able to keep it for one year, even 
if they expand into an additional property, which would have previously 
meant they lost the crucial relief.
