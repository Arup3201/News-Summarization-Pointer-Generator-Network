The widow of Eric Garner has said that prosecutors never had any intention of indicting the police officer who held her husband in the chokehold that killed him.

Esaw Snipes-Garner, 46, appeared on the Today show on Thursday morning, just hours after prosecutors in Staten Island, New York announced that Daniel Pantaleo would not be charged.

In an incident caught on camera in July, Pantaleo was seen placing Garner in a chokehold in the street and ignoring his cries that he could not breathe. Garner later died in hospital.

On Wednesday, authorities announced that the officer would not be indicted - which Mrs Garner said came as no surprise.

Anger: Esaw Snipes-Garner appeared on the Today show on Thursday and said she rejects the apology from the officer who killed her husband with a chokehold. The officer will not be indicted

Let down: Joined by Al Sharpton, she told Savannah Guthrie that she never felt any sincerity from authorities as they investigated her husband's death at the hands of the officer

'Honestly, I think from the beginning I had no faith in Staten Island prosecuting anybody from Staten Island,' she said.

'I felt no remorse, I felt no compassion, no anything from Staten Island - besides the people on Staten Island. As far as the police and the DA - there was no sincerity in his eyes form day one.' 

The officer issued an apology to the family on Wednesday but Mrs Garner said she refused to accept it. 

'The time to apologize or have any remorse would have been when my husband was screaming and he couldn't breathe,' she said.

She also described the moment that she heard that 29-year-old Pantaleo, who is still working for the force but has been put on desk duty, would not face any charges. 

Cuffed: A video shows the aftermath of the chokehold where Garner lies on the floor in cuffs. He had told police 11 times that he could not breathe after they jumped on him when he was found selling untaxed cigarettes

'I just dropped my phone and just started bawling and started crying because it's not fair,' she said. 

'What do they not see? How could they possibly not indict? I felt hopeless. I felt like there was not another corner to turn. Like there was nothing left for me to fight for.' 

She appeared with the Reverend Al Sharpton on the show and said that working with him now gives her hope because she feels like they will seek justice. 

On CBS This Morning on Thursday, she added: 'We need justice. Somebody needs to pay. I'm just trying to, you know, make sure his death is not in vain.'  

Her appearance on the show came after an angry outburst during a press conference on Wednesday night, in which she lashed out at the officer.

'He’s still working, he’s still collecting a paycheck, feeding his kids,' Garner said of Pantaleo. 'My husband is now six feet under and I'm looking for a way to feed my kids.' 

At the press conference, Sharpton called for peaceful protests.

Lashing out: She also appeared at a press conference on Wednesday and said she does not accept officer Daniel Pantaleo's apology for killing her husband with a chokehold over the summer

Outrage: Garner's mother Gwen Carr  expressed her shock over the decision, saying: 'I don’t know what video they were looking at. It wasn't the same one the rest of the world was looking at'

Speaking out: Following the decision, protests were held across the city throughout the night

Mrs Garnder added: 'This fight ain't over, it's just begun. He should be here celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas with his children... He’s not here because a cop did wrong.

'As long as I have a breath in my body, I will fight.' 

Pantaleo had been stripped of his gun and badge and will remain on desk duty pending an internal police investigation that could result in administrative charges.  

In his statement on Wednesday, he said: 'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner...I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.'
