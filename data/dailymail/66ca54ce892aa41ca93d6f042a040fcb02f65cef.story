A lawyer has denied claims he offered a former Australian Workers' Union official and one-time boyfriend of Julia Gillard $200,000 to give evidence against the former Prime Minister.

Ms Gillard's ex Bruce Wilson said in a statement that lawyer Harry Nowicki and another man, 'Z', contacted him in 2012 in an attempt to implicate Ms Gillard in the Australian Workers' Union corruption scandal.

'Z' allegedly offered him money to say that he paid for renovations to Ms Gillard's Melbourne house in 1994, during a meeting in Nelson Bay on the NSW mid-north coast.

Mr Nowicki has refuted Mr Wilson's allegations, telling reporters on Tuesday that he believed Mr Wilson had fabricated evidence and had defamed him.

'I've had four meetings with Bruce and every meeting I've had with him I've said "Bruce, this is a significant story and your role is to tell the truth",' Mr Nowicki said, the AAP reports.

Mr Nowicki, a former industrial lawyer, is writing a book about the Australian Workers' Union (AWU), which is embroiled in the so-called slush fund affair that dogged Ms Gillard throughout her prime ministership.

Mr Wilson will appear before the royal commission into union corruption on Thursday to answer questions over his sensational claim.

The claim was made in a statement by Mr Wilson to the royal commission into union corruption, parts of which were read on air by ABC Melbourne radio presenter Jon Faine on Tuesday.

Mr Faine said he was reading the statement but could not verify its accuracy and made no claim as to its truthfulness.

Mr Wilson claims Z told him "there's money" and that "there are a number of benefactors prepared to support you".

The statement goes on to claim that Mr Nowicki mentioned a sum of $200,000 if Mr Wilson would make a statement about Ms Gillard.

'We just needed a statement to start. Say something like "I paid for renovations to Gillard's house but I can't recall where the money came from",' Mr Wilson's statement says.

Mr Wilson says he refused and told the men the allegations were untrue.

The commission has so far heard evidence that Ms Gillard, who was a lawyer at Slater and Gordon in the 1990s, helped to set up a fund that was used by her then-boyfriend, Mr Wilson, to receive payments when he was an official with the AWU.

Ms Gillard has consistently denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of any impropriety.

Mr Wilson will appear before the royal commission in Sydney on Thursday.
