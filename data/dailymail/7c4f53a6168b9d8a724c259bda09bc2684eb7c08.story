John Carver says that Jonas Gutierrez could be pushing for a first-team place before the end of January.

Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that the Argentine’s contract – which expires in the summer – does not contain a clause which means one more appearance for the club will trigger an extension.

That had led to reports that Gutierrez – who returned to the north-east last month after beating testicular cancer for a second time – would never play for the Magpies again.

Newcastle caretaker John Carver has backed Gutierrez to be ready for first team return by end of January

But with the 31-year-old able to play seven matches before such a clause is invoked, he could be back in the senior squad within the next few weeks.

When asked if Gutierrez could again feature for Newcastle, caretaker boss Carver said: ‘Absolutely. He has played three reserve games and scored his first goal on Monday night.

‘He’s getting fitter and stronger and it’s part of his process. I am liaising with him all the time.

‘Players know better than I do in terms of fitness, but he is about two or three weeks away from pushing for a first-team place.’

Gutierrez made his return to action in an Under 21 game against West Ham United on December 22

Meanwhile, United have been handed a fitness boost with news that Siem de Jong and Mehdi Abeid trained for the first time on Thursday following injury lay-offs.

De Jong has been sidelined since tearing a thigh muscle in September, while Abeid has been plagued by a toe problem.

Saturday’s visit of Southampton will come too early for that pair, but Sammy Ameobi and Davide Santon are in the squad after coming through Monday’s 1-1 draw with Bolton for Peter Beardsley’s Under-21 side.
