Five people are confirmed dead and 25 more are missing and presumed dead after a shopping center in the city of Kazan collapsed in a fire, Russian emergency officials said.

Officials said on Thursday that the toll of missing at the Admiral centre is based on reports from relatives and workers in the shopping center, 450 miles east of Moscow.

Forty people were injured in the blaze.

Regional emergency services head Igor Panshin was quoted by the Tass news agency as saying 'the hope of finding survivors under the shopping center debris has been abandoned.'

The cause of the fire that began Wednesday has not been determined.

At first a security guard battled with the flames on his own before calling the emergency services, according to the BBC. 

It's thought that the blaze began in a cafe situated next to the shopping centre. 

Officials believe a 43,000-square-foot area has been razed to the ground.

Around 500 riot police were eventually deployed to stop members of the public entering the building.
