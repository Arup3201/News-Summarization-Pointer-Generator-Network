Everton's Leon Osman has given the club a boost ahead of Thursday night's Europa League clash against Lille by agreeing a one-year extension to his contract that will keep him at Goodison Park until 2016.

The deal will make Osman one of the longest-serving one-club men in the Premier League alongside team-mate Tony Hibbert and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard - if he stays at Anfield.

Osman, 33, joined Everton's academy as a boy and made his first-team debut against Spurs in January 2003.

He made a long-overdue debut for England in 2012 against Sweden after he had passed the age of 30.

Osman's deal will delight manager Roberto Martinez who sees the influence of senior professionals like him and captain Phil Jagielka as vital for the new generation of youngsters headed by Ross Barkley.

Osman has scored 51 goals in 396 appearances for the club.

Everton face Lille on Thursday as leaders in Group H and victory would virtually guarantee them progress to the knockout stages.
