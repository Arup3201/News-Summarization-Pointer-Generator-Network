Police have now said that they believe the report of a gunman headed towards Yale University was a hoax.

The security scare was based on an anonymous call to the New Haven police department at 9.48am on Monday morning, and after hours of searching the campus, police began doubting the veracity of the call.

Police chief Dean Esserman said that the male caller who said that his roommate was headed towards the Ivy League campus 'sounded like a confused gentleman'.

Lockdown: Police were out in force earlier Monday after issuing a 'shelter in place' warning at Yale following an anonymous tip about a person with a gun on campus

Tip: There were no reports of shots fired or injuries and police have since lifted the order, calling the tip a hoax

The roommate was allegedly armed with a long gun.

'We are tracking down the person who made that phone call,' the chief said during an afternoon press conference, according to The Hartford Courant.

'I wouldn't describe his words as clear and concise.'

Less
than an hour after the initial call, the university sent out a text 
blast email and a message on their Twitter account reporting the 
sighting of a gunman and issued a 'shelter in place' warning urging all 
students and faculty members to remain inside.

SWAT teams, New Haven and campus police responded to the scene.

The
student newspaper, The Yale Daily News, reported that New Haven police 
lieutenant Jeff Hoffman confirmed that one man has been arrested but he 
did not have a gun. He is being questioned after being apprehended about
two hours after the original warning went out.

Credible threat: Police and SWAT teams took over campus said that there were confirmed sightings of the shooter before later reassessing the situation and questioning the initial report

Warnings: Those who remained- the school is on Thanksgiving break- on campus were told to go inside and stay away from the windows but now that warning has been lifted

Two
other witnesses told police that they saw a person with a long gun or 
rifle, though it is not clear where that individual was spotted.

Eventually
they began going door-to-door in residence halls, telling students that
the officials would slide their IDs under the doors and then asked the 
students to let them into the rooms for a check.

As
of 3.30pm, anyone in Calhoun College was given the OK to leave their 
rooms but Old Campus still has the 'shelter in place' warning in effect.

By the early evening, the warning had been completely lifted but police kept streets near campus closed.

Streets near campus have been closed off as the report is investigated.

The majority of the school's students are not on campus today as their November break for Thanksgiving began on Saturday.

The
scare came the same day as a detailed report about the Sandy Hook 
Elementary School shooting was released, revealing details about the 
mentally ill shooter who killed 26 people nearly an hour away from the 
New Haven campus almost a year ago.
