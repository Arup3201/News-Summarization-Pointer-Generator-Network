A heartbroken mother has fulfilled a weight loss promise to her late daughter.

Bride-to-be Lynne Wakefield, 44, from Dukinfield in Tameside, was dangerously overweight when she vowed to slim for her sick daughter Rachael in the run up to her wedding to Rachael's father.

Sadly Rachael died aged just 23 after losing her fight with a rare lung disease, but Lynne continued with her mission to slim down, losing 6st 7lbs for the big day.

Lynne Wakefield, pictured on her wedding day, lost 6 stone after she and her daughter went on a diet before the big day. Sadly, her daughter, 23, passed away before the nuptials

Selfless mother Lynne devoted herself to nursing Rachael, her only child, after she fell ill aged 13.

At her heaviest, Lynne Wakefield was a size 22 - however, she managed to slim down to a 14 in time for her wedding, spurred on by her promise to her daughter

With little time to cook or plan meals, she often resorted to junk food or takeaways as she visited her daughter during lengthy stretches in hospital.

She had twice postponed her marriage to partner Phil due to Rachaelâ€™s treatment, which included a gruelling double lung transplant.

Rachael, the face of an M.E.N. 
campaign which encouraged 20,000 to sign up as organ donors, died in 
October 2011 following complications.

Battling
 to come to terms with the loss, Lynne was eventually persuaded by a 
friend to sign up to her local Slimming World - and lost six stone and 
seven pounds in eight months.

The change was so dramatic that before her big day in Las Vegas in June, her size 22 wedding dress had to be altered to a size 14.

And,
 while Rachael could not be with her parents as they tied the knot, 
Lynne says her daughter was with her every step along the wedding aisle.
