A UK Independence Party candidate has sparked outrage by calling for discussion on whether unborn babies with Down's syndrome or spina bifida should be compulsorily aborted.

Geoffrey Clarke, who will stand for Ukip in Kent County Council elections, has come under fire over his personal 'manifesto' which holds controversial views on disabled people, Muslims and immigration.

Mr Clarke, who is also standing for Gravesham Borough Council in a by-election on Thursday, called for a Government review into NHS expenditure on his website.

The review should 're-examine the 
pregnancy abortion time limit. Consider compulsory abortion when the 
foetus is detected as having Downs, spina bifida or similar syndrome 
which, if it is born, will render the child a burden on the state as 
well as on the family'.

It should also look into medical treatment for people over the age of 80, which the 66-year-old says is 'extraordinarily costly' to the NHS.

This row will come as an embarrassing blow to the party, as polls show support for Ukip at a record high of between seven per cent and 14 per cent of the vote.

But Mr Clarke said that he does not actually endorse the provocative statements on his website.'I do not endorse these ideas,' he said later.

The views expressed by Geoffrey Clarke are a horrific reminder of the science of Eugenics.

It advocated the use of practices which aim at improving the genetic make-up of a population, generally a human population.

People who believe in Eugenics advocate for the improvement of human hereditary traits through the promotion of higher reproduction of more desired people.

A reduction in reproduction of less desired people and traits is encouraged.

Eugenics was at its most popular in the early decades of the 20th Century. It was practiced around the world, with governments, influential institutions and individuals promoting it.

A number of countries introduced eugenics policies and programs which included genetic screening, birth control and marriage restrictions.

Those targeted included the poor, mentally ill, disabled or promiscuous women. In some cases entire racial groups were targeted. An extreme case of this was the mass extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany.

Eugenics was largely abandoned by the end of World War 11.

'They are for the commission to consider how best to cut service levels if it is decided to do so.'

Learning disability charity Mencap questioned whether the candidate is fit for office after he made the comments on his website.

Chief executive Mark Goldring said: 'Mencap is disgusted and horrified by the manifesto of Kent County Council Ukip candidate Geoffrey Clarke who has proposed the compulsory abortion of any foetus with Down's syndrome or spina bifida.

'Much has been written about the Paralympics this summer changing attitudes towards disabled people for the better. Yet in the very same year, a council candidate has proposed forced eugenics against disabled people.

'It is abhorrent that Geoffrey Clarke sees disabled people solely as a burden when people with a learning disability lead full lives and make valuable contributions to their communities and families. We question if he is fit for public office.'

In his manifesto, Mr Clarke also says same-sex marriage is an 'abhorrence'. Population, immigration and threats to Britain's green belt are the three issues closest to his heart.

A Ukip spokesman said they had now suspended Mr Clarke and if he was successful in the election he would not be representing them.

He said: 'This is a personal manifesto. It is more of a shock to us than to anyone.

'He has now been suspended and will not be representing us in the unlikely event that he wins.'
