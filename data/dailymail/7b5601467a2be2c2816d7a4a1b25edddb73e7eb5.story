From dried out monkey heads and antelope skulls to dead birds and crates of baby crocodiles, the wares on sale at the Marche des Feticheurs in the Togolese capital, Lomé, are unusual to say the least.

The largest voodoo pharmacy in the world, the market offers a cornucopia of bizarre cures such as 'strengthening' elephant femur bones and rails festooned with boa constrictor skins which are thought to cure burns by locals.

'Monkey heads are a 
favourite among students come finals time,' explains Constantine James, the photographer who captured these incredible images. 'They’re the voodoo study 
stimulant.'

Gruesome: Tradespeople at the market hold some of the fetishes on sale, among them a dried leopard head and a live tortoise

Heavyweight: A muscular vendor smiles as he hefts an elephant femur (thigh bone) above his head. The bone is thought to confer strength on the person taking it

And monkeys aren't the only animal to end up in the market. Sharing the shelves with primates are shrunken heads that once belonged to dogs, donkeys, hyenas and even leopards.

Other beasts turned into voodoo medicine and hawked by vendors include elephants, hippos, antelopes, whales and living eagles, although for the birds at least, an appearance at the market isn't the end of the road.

'The living hawks are not
 sacrificed,' reveals James. 'Someone who is possessed by an evil spirit will buy the 
hawk, have a voodoo priest transfer the black spirit to the unknowing 
hawk, and then let the hawk go free.

He also has a recipe for a voodoo love potion. 'If you grind up a dried chameleon into a powder, mix it with 
Chanel No. 5 and spray it on yourself, you 
will magically attract the one you secretly admire,' he reveals.

But making a living from providing voodoo cures isn't without its risks. 'Moments after we arrived at the market, the police showed up and arrested a man for being in possession of illegal animal products,' remembers James.

Muscular: A young Togolese boy shoulders an enormous whale vertebrae. Like elephant femurs, whale vertebrae are believed to confer strength

Fetish: Also on sale at the Lomé market are antelope skulls (pictured), powdered chameleons, dried dog and hyena heads, and hippopotamus skulls

Grim: Dried hyena heads can be bought for £200 for use in voodoo medicine along with elephant tail bones and live birds

Charms: Dried monkey heads, such as these baboon bonces held by a youthful vendor, are thought to be a stimulant while hawks (right) are used to get rid of curses

'We were wondering what he possibly could have had considering the strange products people weren't getting arrested for.'

Despite the risk of falling foul of anti-trafficking laws, vendors have been selling fetishes at the Lomé
 market for at least 40 years, although locals claim 
that sales have been going on for more than a 
century.

Voodoo too has long been a popular part of life in Togo, which although more commonly 
associated with Haiti, originated in West Africa and is the official state religion in neighbouring Benin.

The cures associated with the religion are much in demand at the market according to James, with shoppers willing to pay as much as £200 for a dried out hyena head or £80 for a bracelet made from elephant tail bones.

'Elephant femur and whale vertebrae are 
used to strengthen bones or for skeletal issues,' he explains. 'You can buy a hyena 
head for under £200, while £80 will get you an elephant tail to make into a 
bracelet to protect against black magic.

'Boa constrictor skin helps heal burns while vultures are used to combat dark sorcery.' He adds: 'You don’t even want to know how
 much a hippo skull costs!'

With more than 2.5 million adherents in Togo and 1.7 million in Benin, voodoo, or vodun as it's locally known, is one of the most popular West African religions.

Like the better known Haitian voudou, the religion centres on spirit worship; whether powerful deities that control forces of nature or humble presences that inhabit rivers, trees and rocks.

Togolese voodoo worshippers also pray to their ancestors and believe that the spirits of the dead walk side by side with the living, and can be asked to intercede for them with Mawu or Nana Buluku - the mother goddess who occupies the most important place in the vodun pantheon.

Worship is led by women, with each family clan headed by a matriarch who leads prayers on behalf of the clan. Although they take a lead role in rituals, they are not priestesses; a term used solely for women who belong to each clan's spiritual 'convent'.

Talismans such as the fetishes pictured, are thought to contain some of the divine power that adherents believe suffuses every living being on the planet, and can confer healing on the people who use it.

Along with Togo and Benin, other West African peoples to embrace vodun include the Ewe people of eastern and southern Ghana, and the Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria.

Magic: Live hawks are sold to people who think they have been cursed. Voodoo priests will transfer the curse to the bird which is then released - the black magic with it

On sale: Dog and cat skulls are also sold at the market, along with those from turtles (centre right), leopards (right) and voodoo dolls (left)

Stimulant: A collection of baboon skulls, which are used by buyers to give themselves an energy boost as well as stimulate their brains

Doomed: According to Constantine James, jerrycans crammed with baby crocodiles such as this one are found all over the market
