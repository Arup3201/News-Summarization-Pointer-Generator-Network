Manuel Pellegrini has set the stage for today’s title showdown between Chelsea and Manchester City by telling Diego Costa to clean up his act, and rejecting claims from Jose Mourinho that there is a campaign against the Barclays Premier League leaders.

Chelsea, who were last night tying up the £26.8million signing of Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina, will be without Costa at Stamford Bridge after he was given a three-game ban for stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can in the Capital One Cup semi-final.

And Pellegrini said: ‘I know of Diego Costa from Spain. His character is not an easy character.’ The Chilean believes the striker has to curb his aggressive streak. ‘I hope that this punishment will be a good thing for him to change in the future,’ he added. 

Costa has been in excellent form this season, leading the Premier League scoring charts with 17 goals

‘He doesn’t need to do it in that way because he is a very good player. But I am sure Chelsea will not lose their next three games just because he isn’t playing. Big teams cannot depend on just one player. 

Asked if Costa’s ban cancelled out Yaya Toure’s absence on duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, Pellegrini added: ‘I don’t think it helps anything. I think that Diego Costa is an important player for Chelsea and Yaya is a very important player for us. But I don’t think they decide that both teams depend on just those players.

‘So I think it is a very important miss for both teams but Chelsea have other players to replace him.

‘Yaya is a very important player for us but I was not decided that, if he was eliminated from the Africa Cup, he would come and play here two days afterwards because I do not think it is the correct way to do it. We played without Yaya in Rome and qualified in the Champions League and against Bayern Munich, so it is up to other players to demonstrate what they can do.’ 

Costa's ban means the striker will not feature in The Blues' potential title-decider with Manchester City

Champions City will fall eight points behind Chelsea if they lose today but Pellegrini refused to be drawn on his rivalry with Mourinho.

He refused to shake hands with Mourinho over his antics when Fernando Torres scored a late winner in the corresponding fixture last season, and compared Chelsea to Stoke after their defensive tactics earned a 1-1 draw at the Etihad in September. 

‘I won’t talk about what Mourinho might do,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I will shake hands with him before the game. And after? Yes, probably.

‘It was a mistake to compare Chelsea with Stoke. Chelsea can play in the way they want and we are going to continue playing in the style I think is best for this team.’

Pellegrini also dismissed Mourinho’s claims that there is a ‘campaign’ against Chelsea within the Premier League which is influencing referees’ decisions against the leaders.

‘I hope that in the Premier League they don’t have a campaign against anyone,’ he said.

‘I hope the referee makes mistakes for all the teams exactly the same, that the FA make the fixtures in a fair way and the punishments.

‘It is the best league in the world and I don’t think it has any strange things. Because (if that is the case) then you are not competing (fairly). After that, if you win the title, it’s not an important title, because it is all arranged.’ 

Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard spent 13 years as a Chelsea player, winning three league titles

Pellegrini, who revealed that Samir Nasri and Eliaquim Mangala are injury doubts, believes that Frank Lampard will be given a good reception on his return to Stamford Bridge where she spent 13 years as a player, whether the former England midfielder would celebrate a goal against his old club or not.

He added: ‘First I prefer him to score the goal. After that we will see if he celebrates or if he doesn’t celebrate. If he scores, I celebrate.

‘I am sure that Frank Lampard will receive the best reception from their fans that they can do. He is a top player. He is maybe the most important in their history. He gave so many things to that club. If he couldn’t continue playing there, he can play here. That is not his fault. I am sure the fans will repeat the reception they gave here to Frank in the first game.’

 Meanwhile, Cuadrado will fly in from Italy on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich’s private jet on Saturday to complete his move to Stamford Bridge, with Mohamed Salah set to move in the other direction on loan.

Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella confirmed on Friday a deal for the Colombia winger had been agreed, saying: ‘It was a sale that had to be done. I’m happy for him because he is going to a big club.’ 

The clash between Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini's sides could potentially decide the league title
