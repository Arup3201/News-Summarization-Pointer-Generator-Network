A 15-year-old Guatemalan boy whose death became a symbol of the perils facing children attempting to illegally cross into the United States was buried in his hometown Saturday, amid prayers and tears from his family.

Neighbors in this mountain village filled the small home where Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez grew up, turning the room where he slept on the floor into a space to mourn over his gray and silver coffin.

A white bow hung on the front door in a sign of mourning.

Inside the humble concrete home, women cried and prayed while men waited to carry Gilberto's body to the hilltop cemetery overlooking the village.

Untimely: The body of Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez was found on June 15. He likely died from sun exposure in hot, dry brush country of South Texas. An autopsy did not find signs of trauma. His body was less than a mile from a nearby home.

Amid highland flowers and candles sat a photograph of the boy.

'Ay, my son, now I won't see you again,' his mother, Cipriana Juarez, shouted between tears.

The boy's decomposed body was discovered on June 15 in the Rio Grande Valley, not far inside Texas from the border with Mexico.

Around his neck was a rosary he had received as a gift for his first communion as a Roman Catholic.

Scribbled inside his belt buckle was the phone number of an older brother in Chicago he had hoped to reach.

He apparently got lost on his way north and likely died from exposure in hot, dry brush country of South Texas.

Heartbroken: Cipriana Juarez Diaz
 recalled how she told her son Gilberto Francisco not to leave their 
home, but he insisted on making the trek to the U.S. border

An autopsy did not find signs of trauma.

His body was less than a mile from a nearby home.

Gilberto's death highlighted the hardships that afflict young migrants.

The U.S. government is searching for ways to deal with record numbers of unaccompanied children who are sneaking into the country, fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.

The family said Gilberto had hoped to find work to pay for medicine his mother needs.

Workers in the mountains of northern Guatemala earn about $3.50 a day, said his uncle, Catarino Ramos.

'He left because of poverty, because he wanted to help buy his mother's medicine,' Catarino Ramos said.

Now, the family will have to find a way to repay the $2,500 loan they took out, mortgaging their home, to pay for Gilberto's journey.

'Here, only sadness will remain," said the boy's father, Francisco Ramos.

The mother of a Guatemalan boy whose body was found in the desert about a mile from Texas’ southern border said Tuesday she begged him not to make the dangerous journey from the Cuchumatanes mountains – but he didn’t listen.

Last week mother Cipriana Juarez Diaz, who suffers from epilepsy and is bedridden, said her son Gilberto told her he wanted to earn money to help her.

However she begged me not to make the dangerous, but he refused to listen.

‘I told him not to go but he wanted to help me get rid of my illness,’ said Juarez Diaz.

Before Gilberto set out from his family’s humble cinder-block and sheet-metal home, his mother draped him with a white rosary.

‘He was a good son,’ she said. 

While hundreds of immigrants die crossing
 the border each year, the discovery of the teenager's decomposed 
remains highlights the perils unaccompanied children face as the U.S. 
government searches for ways to deal with record numbers of children 
crossing into the country illegally.
