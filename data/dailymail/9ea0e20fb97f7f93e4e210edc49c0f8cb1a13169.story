The man arrested for allegedly assaulting Modern Family star Sarah Hyland last week may have been involved in a similar incident a year ago with Hollywood actress Sandra Bullock.

In video footage released by the Sunday Telegraph, a man of similar appearance can be seen reaching out to the Acadamy Award nominee as she greeted fans the red carpet in July.

She was in Sydney, at George Street's Event Cinemas, at the premiere of her film The Heat.

Previeous incident: Sandra Bullock, pictured at the 86th Academy Awards nominee luncheon on February 10, can be seen in a recently released video reacting to a fan's unwanted attention

As the man reaches out, his hand grazes her left breast. The moved could just as easily be accidental as on purpose. But the 49-year-old actress immediately flinches away from the fan and instinctively covers herself up.

She is then seen to put both her hands out - palms first in a defensive gesture - saying: 'Wait, wait, wait, wait - don't touch my breast!'

Minders move in while the fan looks like he is trying to explain himself.

'Don't touch me there': Sarah was left in tears when she was groped by a fan at a Modern Family party in Sydney on Thursday night

Bullock later tries to laugh off the incident and finally poses for a photo with the man.

On Thursday night Sarah Hyland was not as forgiving.

The 23-year-old actress had been posing with fans outside the Modern Family party hosted by Qantas at The Sebel Pier One in Sydney, Australia, when the incident occurred. She was in tears when a male fan asked her for a photograph and then allegedly grabbed her breast.

Sarah is then said to have pushed the man away and screamed 'Don't touch me there!' before her security stepped in to question the fan and pass the matter over to the police.

Pictures from the event showed Sarah angrily pointing at a man believed to have been the one who touched her inappropriately.

After the incident, Sarah is reported to have left the venue via the rear door in floods of tears.

Explaining her early exit from the event, Sarah later took to Twitter and wrote: 'Sorry to all the fans outside the #qantas event that I didn't get to say hi to but I had to leave due to an inappropriate touch of a fan.'
