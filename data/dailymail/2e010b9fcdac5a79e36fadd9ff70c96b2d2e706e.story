The parents of a toddler who was left disfigured after being hit with a stun-gun grenade in a botched drug raid while he slept in his crib are speaking out after a grand jury decided not to bring up charges in the heartbreaking case.

Alecia and Bounkham Phonesavanh's youngest son Bounkham Jr, called 'Bou Bou', was just 18-months-old when a SWAT team burst through his bedroom and threw a flash-bang device at his sleeper crib, in the hunt to find a drug-dealing cousin who didn't even live there.

Now, after several surgeries to address the boy's serious injuries, the family is left with over $1million in medical bills that the county has refused to pay. 

'Before this we didn’t owe anybody anything,' Mrs Phonesavanh recently told ABC News. 'And now after all this, they have completely financially crippled us.'

And that wasn't the only tragedy the family experienced last year. 

The Phonesavanhs and their four children were only in Georgia because their house in Janesville, Wisconsin burned down that spring, leaving them homeless. 

They moved in with Bounkham's sister in Cornelia, Georgia while looking for a new home back in Wisconsin, all crammed into the garage, converted into a bedroom. 

They had just found a new home and were planning to move back to Wisconsin when the SWAT raid happened in the early hours of May 28. 

The SWAT team was looking for Mr Phonesavanh's 30-year-old nephew Wanis Thonetheva, who an informant said was selling methamphetamine from his mother's house where the family was staying. 

Drug agent Nikki Autry secured the 'no-knock' warrant, which allowed her team to search the house without notifying the owners. 

Heartbreaking: In October, a grand jury decided not to bring up criminal charges related to the raid, which left Bou Bou with burns to his face and chest and a collapsed lung (pictured before the raid on the left, and after on the right) 

Scarred: Bou Bou spend five weeks in a medically-induced coma and continues to recover from his injuries. His parents say they now owe more than $1million in medical bills, which the county has refused to pay 

Damage: A SWAT team was carrying out a 'no-knock' warrant to arrest Bou Bou's drug-dealer cousin the night of the accident 

Wrong house: But his parents say they didn't see 30-year-old Wanis Thonetheva at the house the entire time they were staying there 

Police reports show that it was Habersham Deputy Charles Long who threw the 'flash-bang' grenade that landed in Bou Bou's pack-and-play.

Mrs Phonesavanh says she immediately heard her baby start screaming, and she went to grab him but was stopped by police, with Deputy Jason Stribling stepping in to pick up the child.  

'I kept telling him, "Just give me my son. He's scared. He needs me." The officer wouldn't. And then he walked out of the room with [Bou Bou] and I didn't see him again.'

She says they wouldn't even let her see her child before taking him away in an ambulance, and only said at the time that he was fine and just lost a tooth.

But Mr Phonesavanh got a clue about the real extent of his son's injuries when he  noticed a pool of blood by the baby's crib. 

The couple were held by police for two hours, and when they showed up at the hospital, they found Bou Bou in a serious condition with burns on his face and torso and a collapsed lung. 

Bou Bou was in such poor condition that doctors at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital put him into a medically-induced coma for five weeks. 

Meanwhile, police arrested Thonetheva a few hours later without incident. He pleaded guilty to selling meth and is currently serving a 10-year sentence in Georgia prison. 

Mrs Phonesavanh still doesn't know why drug agents thought Thonetheva was at the home. She says while her sister-in-law feared her son had stolen things from the house, they never saw him the entire time they were living there.  

'They messed up,' Mrs Phonesavanh said. 'They had a faulty search warrant. They raided the wrong house.'

While her son was still healing in the hospital, both Agent Autry and the judge who signed the warrant resigned from their positions, and later the task force that organized the raid was disbanded. 

However, the family is now left reeling by the fact that a grand jury investigating the raid decided not to bring up criminal charges in the case, though they admitted the work was 'sloppy'.

And the family hasn't received any compensation from the county since a Georgia state 'gratuity' law protects local governments from having to pay. 

The family still has the option to file a civil suit however,  and there is also an ongoing federal investigation.

The Phonsevanh's have three other children including 7-year-old Emma, 5-year-old Mali and 3-year-old Charlie. 

They have set up a webpage to bring justice for their baby, which can be reached below.  

All together: The couple have three other children together including 7-year-old daughter Emma, 5-year-old daughter Mali and 3-year-old daughter Charlie
