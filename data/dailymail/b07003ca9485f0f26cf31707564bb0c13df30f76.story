Harry Kane's brother, Charlie, took to Twitter on Sunday to show his support to his younger sibling ahead of Tottenham's Capital One Cup final against Chelsea. 

Charlie posted a selfie with his family and friends on the social networking site, as they made their way to Wembley for the showpiece clash, with a number on show wearing masks of the in-form Spurs forward - who has scored an impressive 24 goals in 38 appearances this season.

Charlie is clearly very supportive of his brother, as just last month he was caught on video in a local pub celebrating Spurs' 2-1 North London derby success over Arsenal, leading the chants of 'He's one of our own', after Kane Jnr grabbed a crucial double in the win.

A day earlier Kane Snr posted on Twitter 'Sleepless night ahead' as he looked forward to Sunday's crunch clash 

Kane himself - whose remarkable rise to Premier League stardom is the story of the season - couldn't contain his excitement ahead of the match either when talking to Sky Sports.

He said: 'It’s special you know - I can’t wait. The atmosphere is going to be electric and I just can’t wait for it all to start.

‘Any boy growing up playing will tell you that their ultimate dream is to play in a cup final. I’m just so excited of course, and is the whole team.'
