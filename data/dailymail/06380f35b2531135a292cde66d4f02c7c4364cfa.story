Authorities say two people aboard a small plane that was reported missing have been found dead at the crash site in northern Colorado.

The Steamboat Pilot & Today reports that Routt County Undersheriff Ray Birch says rescue workers found the wreckage early Sunday near Steamboat Springs.

The names of the two people on the plane have been not immediately released.

The Denver Post reported that search teams were heading toward the area where the plane was believed to have gone down in Routt County.

The crash site was southwest of Walton Peak, a 10,544-foot mountain.

Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, told the Post that the plane was a Piper PA-28 and two people were aboard. 

Jim Linville, incident commander for Routt County Search and Rescue said the plane was believed to have gone down on Rabbit Ears Pass. 

He said: 'Planes leaving Steamboat don't realize they have to gain more altitude before they go up that drainage and that's where they end up.'

Linville says it is an area where there have been three previous plane crashes over the years.
