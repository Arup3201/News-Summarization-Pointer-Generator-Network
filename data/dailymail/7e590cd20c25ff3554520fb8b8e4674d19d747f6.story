It's been a bad few years for the disgraced Eliot Spitzer - but things could be about to get worse.

Now the former New York governor has been hit with huge libel lawsuits totalling $90million over a column he wrote for a magazine website about an insurance bid-rigging scandal.

Marsh & McLennan Cos former executives William Gilman and Edward McNenney are suing him over a column from August 2010 suggesting corporate wrongdoers should be prosecuted.

'Defamation': Eliot Spitzer, pictured in 2003 during his days as New York state attorney general, has been hit with libel lawsuits totalling almost $100million over a column he wrote about an insurance bid-rigging scandal

The Slate.com piece - ‘They 
Still Don't Get It’ - also defended the former New York state attorney general's own enforcement activity
against Marsh and insurer American International Group (AIG).

Former executive marketing director Mr Gilman and global placement director Mr McNenney claim the column defamed them, although they are not named.

It appeared soon after a judge threw out their convictions on felony antitrust charges.

Slate.com is owned by Washington Post Co, and its parent group is a defendant in both cases.

Mr Gilman filed his $60million lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, while Mr McNenney filed papers seeking $30million with the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.

Mr Gilman had worked at Marsh for 28 years and Mr McNenney for 14 years when Mr Spitzer, former New York attorney general, in 2004 opened a probe into the company's practices.

This included alleged kickbacks for steering of clients to favoured insurers, by the then-largest U.S. insurance broker.

Marsh agreed in 2005 to pay $850million in a civil settlement with Mr Spitzer, and eight insurance executives including Mr Gilman and Mr McNenney were indicted eight months later in the probe.

'Mr Spitzer was well aware of his own 
allegations as attorney general and the resolution of those allegations 
in favour of Mr Gilman and yet, recklessly disregarded these facts'

Lawsuit from William Gilman

Both men were found guilty in February 2008, but the presiding judge threw out that conviction in July 2010, citing new evidence. That case was dismissed in January.

The other indicted executives either were acquitted or had their cases dismissed and 21 others pleaded guilty.

In his complaint, Mr Gilman said Mr Spitzer stated ‘Marsh's behaviour was a blatant abuse of law and market power: price-fixing, bid-rigging and kickbacks all designed to harm their customers and the market while Marsh and its employees pocketed the increased fees and kickbacks.’

Mr Gilman also said Mr Spitzer defamed him in writing by stating that ‘many employees of Marsh’ have been ‘convicted and sentenced to jail terms’, when none had.

Mr Spitzer had written the column shortly after an editorial critical of him in The Wall Street Journal.

‘While Mr Spitzer's statements do not 
refer to Mr Gilman by name, Mr Gilman is readily identifiable as the 
subject of the defamatory comments,’ Mr Gilman's complaint said.

‘I don't know what possessed him to make the statements that he made’

‘Mr Spitzer was well aware of his own allegations as attorney general and the resolution of those allegations in favour of Mr Gilman and yet, recklessly disregarded these facts,’ the complaint said.

Punitive damages account for half the amounts sought in each lawsuit.

‘I don't know what possessed him to make the statements that he made,’ Jeffrey Liddle, a lawyer for Mr Gilman and Mr McNenney, said in an interview, referring to Mr Spitzer.

Humiliation: Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer addressed the media with his wife Silda Wall in March 2008 to announce his resignation from office after revelations that he had been a client of a prostitution ring

In June, Mr Gilman and Mr McNenney accused Marsh in a separate lawsuit of colluding with Mr Spitzer to make them ‘scapegoats’ and avert potential criminal charges against the company.

That case seeks to recover unpaid compensation and other damages.

Last month, CNN cancelled Spitzer's low-rated television talk show ‘In the Arena’ after less than one year on the air.

Mr Spitzer resigned as New York's governor in March 2008 after a scandal in which it was revealed that he had hired a high-priced prostitute.

Neither Mr Spitzer nor the Washington Post have yet commented on the new lawsuits.
