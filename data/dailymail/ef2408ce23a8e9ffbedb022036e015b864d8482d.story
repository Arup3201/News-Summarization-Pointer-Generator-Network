A Chinese boy almost suffocated after getting his head trapped in a car window after his mother left him alone in the vehicle while she went shopping.  

Cheng Shen, seven, got stuck in a 5cm gap between the window and the door frame, after being abandoned in the city of Quanzhou, in south-eastern China's Fujian Province.

His mother Heng Lu said she thought she was only going to be a few minutes, so it would 'okay to leave him on his own'.

She added: 'I told him not to mess around with anything and left the window open so he could get some fresh air.' 

But that decision almost proved fatal. The youngster poked his head out the window and accidentally stood on the window lever, making the electric window rise up and trap his neck. 

Horrified shoppers tried to push the window down and called police, but nobody felt confident enough to break the window and instead called for police assistance.

They also took pictures of the incident, which were quickly shared across social media sites

A police spokesman said although they received several calls about the incident, it was resolved by an officer who was already nearby and was 'quickly able to act to free the child'. 

Cheng was given on the spot emergency treatment to get him breathing normally again, by which time his mother had returned.

The spokesman said the woman was advised against leaving the boy on his own in future, and advised to take her son to the hospital to be checked further, 'which she promised to do' .
