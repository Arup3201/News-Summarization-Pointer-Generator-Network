A U.S. General has blamed the head of the British Army for the death of troops in Afghanistan saying he refused to carry out air strikes when they were asked for.

Daniel Bolger, who retired last year as a lieutenant-general, said ‘young riflemen paid the price’ for General Sir Nick Carter’s ‘risk averse’ mentality and fear of causing civilian casualties.

He said that while other generals went to the front line with their men, Sir Nick made only brief helicopter trips to safe positions and instead turned down requests for aircraft and artillery from the safety of his ‘large, well-appointed command post.’

The American claimed his British counterpart was a ‘peppy, pushy fellow’ and said: ‘He’s not the type of general I would put in charge of anything.’

The outspoken attack in his new book Why We Lost: A General’s Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, highlights the tensions between senior U.S. and British officers over how to take on the Taliban.

Bolger served alongside Sir Nick at Nato headquarters in Kabul and became exasperated by his strict interpretation of the policy of ‘courageous restraint’ which was meant to cut the number of civilian casualties.

Under the policy, Nato troops were forbidden from firing unless they were fired upon and could identify their attackers and were warned destroying a home or property ‘creates more insurgents’.

Bolger said: ‘In the First World War you had the chateau generals. Now we’ve got the digital chateau generals where they sit and get PowerPoint briefings and think that told them what the hell was going on.’

He claimed Sir Nick’s attitude was: ‘‘Oh, I don’t want to oversupervise my troops, I’ll give them all these rules to follow then let them sort it out on the ground’‘, but he added that ‘this is the same guy trying to direct where every single artillery round goes’.

In his book, Bolger refers to a 2010 report by former US colonel Harry Tunnell which claimed Sir Nick showed a ‘gross lack of concern for subordinates’.

He claimed Sir Nick gave a verbal order that any civilian casualties were unacceptable and ‘coalition soldiers may have to be killed rather than defend themselves’.

The criticism refers to the time when Sir Nick was the head of Nato’s Regional Command South in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010.

But British military officials defended Sir Nick, 55, who was appointed chief of the general staff in September.

‘UK forces have always worked closely with their US counterparts and the concept of courageous restraint was an International Security Assistance Force-led initiative which was in place across Afghanistan,’ a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. ‘In any operation, UK troops always have the inherent right to self-defence and accusations that troops were put in unnecessary danger are nonsensical.’

Lord Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, told the Sunday Times that the criticisms were ‘very unfair’.

He said: ‘I hope he sells half a dozen copies and not many more than that.’
