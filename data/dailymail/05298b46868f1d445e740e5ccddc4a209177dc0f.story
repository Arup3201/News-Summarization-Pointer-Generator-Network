When dusk descends each evening on this sleepy suburban hamlet, it's mob rule on the streets - mobs of kangaroos each lorded over by an 'Alpha male'.

Just over 100km north of Sydney's central business district, the quiet township has a population of 500 people and 200 kangaroos, with the marsupials growing faster than the humans and taking right of way.

But the residents of of tiny Wyee Point, in Lake Macquarie, NSW, about an hour and a half north of Sydney, did not think anything of their kangaroo mobs or regular evening encounters with the marsupials until a video of two 1.4m tall male kangaroos in a 'boxing fight' in one of their streets went viral this week.

Wyee Point, 100km north of Sydney, has a population of 500 people and 200 kangaroos, with the marsupials growing faster than the humans and taking right of way

Like the other residents of Wyee Point, Rod Langham (centre back, pictured with his wife Marlene and their five children Corey, 28, Kiera, 25, Christina, 23, Thomas, 12 and Renee, 10) did not think anything of the kangaroo mobs or regular evening encounters with the marsupials

Shot on his phone by local father of five, Rod Langham, the five minute video of a rogue buck and the resident Alpha male of Watanga Crescent, Wyee Point punching and kicking each other while balancing on their tails has attracted 1.5 million views on YouTube.

And now that images of Mr Langham's neighbourhood have gone around the world, the 54-year-old sheet metal worker is becoming a media personality.

Mr Langham, who a week ago didn't really know what YouTube was, is being interviewed by foreign TV crews fascinated with the footage of the two buck roos slugging it out in a classic mating season joust for domination right outside his front door.

The international media attention has astonished Mr Langham, who with his wife, Marlene, a trainee psychiatric nurse, moved to the street just over ten years ago to provide a better life for themselves and their children, aged 10 to 28 years old. 

The father-of-five filmed the viral footage of two kangaroos fighting in the street outside his house (above) on Watanga Crescent at Wyee Point

He said the fight was between an Alpha male who lives with his family on the street and a 'rogue male' who challenged the buck in a 20 minute stoush

Residents say they ofetn see groups of roos in the street - and are forced to drive around them

In that time they have seen Wyee Point - an old 19th century sawmill settlement which lies on picturesque Lake Macquarie, on the NSW Central Coast - experience a boom in its kangaroo population.

'There's a mob each with an alpha male for every street,' Mr Langham told Daily Mail Australia, 'and there's three in the making at any one time, one joey in the pouch and two others. 

'They put the housing estate in here 15 years ago between Morisset and Wyee Point, where there was a lot of bushland.

Booming population: Kangaroos, also known as boomers, have been growing in unprecedented numbers in the township of Wyee Point, on the NSW Central Coast, where Watanga Crescent resident and father of five Rod Langham filmed the YouTube viral media hit video of two boxing male roos

Kung fu: During the fight, the two bucks can be seen pawing at each other's head, shoulders and chests, just like boxers during a 20 minute encounter which metal worker Rod Langham said he couldn't capture all of on his phone because it ran out of memory

Kangaroos, also known as macropods, which mean large foot, are Australian marsupials which grow to a height of 1.5m in the male of the species.

They move by hopping at a speed of up to 40kph, using their powerful tail and hind legs to propel themselves.

Male kangaroos are called bucks, boomers or jacks and the females are does, or jills, and the young are called joeys. A group is a mob, troop or court.

Kangaroos are herbivores and usually docile towards humans, but fighting is common among males, particularly during Spring when the females are in season.

During a fight, kangaroos adopt a high standing posture and paw at each other’s head, shoulders, and chests, just like boxers.

They will also lock forearms, wrestle and kick and push each other.

'It's only a matter of time that their population will overtake the likes of us, but you have to show them respect. They were here long before we were.'

Mr Langham was at home in his garage on Monday, September 29 when just after 4pm his 23-year-old daughter, Christina, alerted him to the sounds of punching and thumping coming from the street.

'She came in and said, "Dad, look at this" and I came outside to see these two males having a go at each other.

'We're so used to kangaroos around in the streets, but the fighting only happens once a year, in Spring, so I thought I'm going to get a video of this.'

Mr Langham filmed the kangaroos sparring with each other for five minutes and 19 seconds until his phone ran out of memory.

Then the punching and kickboxing continue for another fifteen minutes until the two kangaroos broke and the rogue male hopped away.

'I don't think they really meant to hurt each other because there was no rips into their tummy with their claws,' Mr Langham said, 'I think it was just a show for the girls - there were female kangaroos watching it. 

Tail action: The roos are seen to balance on their powerful tails and raise their legs to kick at one another, but Rod Langham believes the joust was a 'show for the ladies' as they didn't rip each other's bellies with their claws and a group of female kangaroos was watching the entire incident

Outnumbered: Rod Langham says since he and his wife Marlene moved their family into Watanga Crescent, Wyee Point ten years ago the kangaroo population has burgeoned and will eventually outnumber them, but he respects the roos and is careful to give them right of way each evening on the roads

'We're used to kangaroos coming in each morning and evening to graze on our manicured lawns.

'When you see a mob on the road and you are driving, you give way or drive around them.

'But you don't usually see them fighting. That usually happens in the bush, so this was something different.'

Face off: Typically of male kangaroos during Spring when the females are in season, the two adult males fight over access to females or the ascendant position near a water source, but Rod Langham said the confrontation usually happens in the bush rather than on a suburban street

At it again: Just after 4pm on Monday, September 29  just after Rod Langham's 23-year-old daughter, Christina, alerted him to the sounds of punching and thumping coming from the street. He walked out of his garage to find the two male buck kangaroos (above) fighting and filmed them on his phone

Mr Langham showed his wife and their other children, Corey, 28, Kiera, 25, and Thomas, 12, and ten-year-old Renee the footage, but it was only when he went to work and showed it to his colleagues that someone recommended he upload it to YouTube. With his children's help, he uploaded it on October 2. 

'It didn't really start taking off until Sunday. It had a couple of hundred hits and then suddenly it was 30,000 and then it just took off.

'I've done interviews and I keep on getting phone calls. Now there's a crew from Brazil who are interviewing me via Skype.'
