The 55-year-old, was sentenced last week to 200 years in prison for impregnating his granddaughter and sexually abusing her younger sister

An 11-year-old girl from Montana has opened up about how her 55-year-old pedophile grandfather got her pregnant and then tried to cover up the incest by spinning a web of lies. 

The man was sentenced last week to 200 years in prison for impregnating his granddaughter and sexually abusing her younger sister.

The Stevensville man was arrested in June after the victim was found to be 32 weeks pregnant after a doctor’s visit.

He was the legal guardian of the 11-year-old and her 9-year-old sister.

Investigators said the grandfather, who had a history of predatory conduct targeting young women dating back to the early 1980s, molested both girls in his care.

Speaking to The Missoulian, the 11-year-old victim said she had no idea she was pregnant until she went the doctor in June complaining of stomach cramps.

'I didn't know what pregnant felt like, so I didn't know,' the unnamed girl said.

The 11-year-old delivered a baby in August.

During an interview with the head of a children’s advocacy organization, the little girl said when she would reject her grandfather’s sexual advances, he would 'lie on the couch and pout.'

'He’d wait to see if I could come out and look at him and feel sorry for him, but I wouldn’t,’ she said.

To cover up the incestuous sex crime, the 11-year-old said her grandfather concocted a story for her to tell the children’s advocate about a 14-year-old boy who had gotten her pregnant at the county fair the summer before.

However, medical staff noted that the term of the pregnancy and girl's suggested date of conception were out by three months.

The girl later confirmed that her grandfather was the father of her baby.

‘Instead of him doing the wrong thing, he would come in and tell me what to say,’ the girl said in August. ‘He didn’t want to get caught.’

The girl's younger sister has revealed that on several occasions, she awakened on her bunk bed and watched through a hole as her grandfather molested her big sister.

On July 1 last year, the nine-year-old girl told her biological mother that she witnessed the pedophile come into the girl's bedroom and assault her sister with his hands and mouth. 

During a forensic interview, she gave a detailed account of the oral sex, The Missoulian reported.

The younger girl also told investigators that he had sexually assaulted her by 'kissing her privates', then telling her it was a secret she had to keep.

During the sentencing hearing Wednesday, Judge Jeffrey Langton said the convicted pedophile would be a menace to children if he remained free.

‘You seem to lack any semblance of a conscience,’ Langton said.

When given the chance to speak, he muttered: ' I'm so sorry.'

His two 100-year sentences will run consecutively. He will become eligible for parole only at the age of 105 and will be required to register as a Level 3 sex offender.

The convicted pedophile had been charged two decades ago with lewd conduct with a minor and forced sexual penetration in a different state. 

The sheriff's office is still investigating claims that the pedophile, who is married according to public records, sexually assaulted other girls, one as young as three.
