A pregnant British mother and two of her children have been killed in a car crash on their way home from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.

Imrana Bhamji, in her 30s, died with her four-year-old son Zakariya and daughter Aysha, six, in the holy city of Medina when their car hit a lorry in heavy fog.

Her husband, Blackburn-born Muhammed, 35, and their three other daughters - Fatima, seven, Huafiza, eight, and Humairah, 10 - are in hospital in a critical condition, reports claim.

Tragic: A pregnant mother-of-five from Blackburn and two of her children have been killed in a car crash in the holy city of Madina (pictured), Saudi Arabia, as they travelled home after a pilgrimage

The family moved from their home in Blackburn, Lancashire, to settle in Riyadh eight weeks ago, according to the Lancashire Telegraph.

Mr Bhamji, the report said, had recently taken up a role as a teacher in the city.

As the burial palce of the Islamic prophet Muhammed, Madina is the second holy city after Mecca.

Along with thousands of Muslims, the family are believed to have taken part in  a pilgrimage to the holy cities.

On Saturday, they were driving through the outskirts of Madina, the capital of Al Madinah province, in heavy fog when they were hit by a lorry.

They were taken to King Fahad Hospital but Imrana and her youngest children were pronounced dead. 

Tributes: A vigil has been held for the family at their mosque, Noorul Islam, in Blackburn. Imrana's husband Muhammed, 35, and their three other daughters aged seven, eight and 10 remain in a critical condition 

Paying tribute, Mr Bhamji's sister Shamima told the Lancashire Telegraph: 'As a family, we are devastated at this time.

'We are sadly facing this tragedy and we are flying out to Saudi Arabia to join the family and my brother.

'They were finishing their pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.' 

She added: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with them.'

A vigil has been held at the Noorul Islam mosque in Blackburn, where the family were members before they emigrated. 

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office added: 'We are aware of an incident in Madina involving British nationals. We can confirm the death of three British nationals in this incident.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

Blackburn MP Jack Straw has been contacted by MailOnline for a comment.
