A Royal Navy destroyer was scrambled to Scotland in a major security scare after a Russian aircraft carrier came within 30 miles of British shores for the first time in 20 years.

HMS York travelled around 1,000 miles from Portsmouth to keep watch as the 65,000 tonne Admiral Kuznetsov and a number of other battleships anchored on the edge of UK waters.

Today the Scottish National Party 
accused the Russians of dumping waste into the water while moored off 
the coast at Moray Firth on Monday.

Scare: HMS York keeps watch as the Admiral Kuznetsov anchors just outside British waters off the coast at Moray Firth, Scotland, on Monday

Scrambled: British warship sent 1,000 miles to intercept Russian vessel

The vessels did not warn British 
authorities they were going to come so close to the coast and are 
thought to have blamed bad weather for having to approach.

They are believed to be still in the area today while they avoid poor sea conditions but are no longer anchored.

Previously defence chiefs would have 
scrambled Nimrod aircraft from RAF Kinloss in Moray but because the base
 has been scrapped in cutbacks and a new fleet of planes cancelled, the 
Navy had no choice but to send HMS York.

Although the Russian fleet was 
outside UK waters it was within the exclusive economic zone which 
Britain has the sole rights to exploit.

The Admiral Kuznetsov is en route 
to the Mediterranean from its northern base at Severomorsk for exercises
 with the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

A spokesman for the Ministry of 
Defence said: 'The Admiral Kuznetsov, with other warships and support 
vessels, is thought to be en route to the Mediterranean on exercise.

'The
 aircraft carrier anchored outside British territorial waters some 30 
miles off the Moray Firth where she was thought to have taken advantage 
of the relative shelter to avoid the worst of current bad weather in the
 North Sea.'

Westminster SNP leader and Defence spokesman Angus Robertson has 
condemned the 'marine fly-tipping' and is asking the British Government what 
it has done about the incident.

Mr Robertson said: 'Given the bad 
weather conditions the Russian vessels are very welcome to shelter off 
the Scottish coast, but it is more than bad manners to dispose of waste 
by simply throwing it overboard.

'This is in contravention of agreements and normal practice and I think we need answers from the Russian and UK Governments.

Although two decades may have passed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Britain faces a new Russian threat as Vladimir Putin flexes his military muscle.

RAF Tornadoes are regularly scrambled to intercept supersonic invaders approaching UK airspace.

In 2009 alone, jets were sent up 20 times to repel Russian warplanes. After a gap of 15 years, Putin resumed the intrusions in 2007.

On one occasion, an eight-strong force was detected heading this way from the Barents Sea.

They're not infringing any law while they stay in international airspace, but they cannot be ignored.

However, until now the false battle has been consigned skies. The Admiral Kuznetsov was the first Russian vessel to get so close to British shores for 20 years.

British military aircraft are on standby 24 hours a day and can be scrambled in minutes to respond to threats.

'Have the appropriate authorities been informed? What was disposed of? Why was it not done properly?'

In a series of parliamentary questions Mr Robertson is asking the UK Government about the incident.

He
 wrote: 'Will the Ministry of Defence confirm that Russian personnel 
aboard the Admiral Kuznetsov have been observed disposing of waste into 
the sea off the Scottish coast?'

'Was the UK National Maritime Intelligence Centre informed about the waste disposal?

'Has the Scottish Government and Marine Scotland been informed about the incident by National Maritime Intelligence Centre?'

A Royal Navy spokesman added that Russia was 'almost certainly' acting in accordance with international rules.

He said: 'Russia is signed up to the International Maritime Organisation's maritime pollution rules, of which they are very strict followers. If they are doing it, it's almost certainly in accordance with the regulations and is most likely going to be low-level food waste.'

Although
 aircraft carriers have not got so close to British waters for 20 years,
 jets have been scrambled to intercept Russian planes.

RAF Tornadoes have been sent up 20 times in 2009 alone after the foreign aircraft got close to British airspace.
