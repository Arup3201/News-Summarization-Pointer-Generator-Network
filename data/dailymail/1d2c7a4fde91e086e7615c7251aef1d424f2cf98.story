Roy Hodgson thanked the people of Manaus for the fabulous welcome they afforded England but his players had to abandon a stroll in the park yesterday because they were mobbed by well wishers.

Hodgson said: 'Our trip to the supermarket... the shopping mall, I mean, we thought it might be nice for the players to get out and see the place, but the mobbing was so much we had to abort the trip.'

Captain Steven Gerrard added: 'There wasn't any shopping getting done. We went for a morning stroll, that's all, mixing with the locals. But the serious stuff starts now.'

Hodgson claimed the pitch looked 'flat' and 'fine' as England trained in the stadium.

It was watered before the session and definitely seemed greener than it had 24 hours earlier, when ground staff appeared to be spraying it with powder or paint.

The players were relieved to see there was no sun on the pitch late in the afternoon. Saturday's game kicks off at 6pm local time.

Hodgson also insisted there had never been a great concern about playing in the Amazon city even though he said before the draw that he would prefer to avoid Manaus.

'Sometimes interpretation comes out the wrong way,' said the England boss. 'If there was any damage had been perceived, it's been cleared up.

'I've met the mayor and the governor, had good talks and discussions... We wanted to play in the World Cup, to play in Brazil, and to play where we were told. I can't believe the friendliness of the people, their enthusiasm.

'We're not concerned about the heat. We'll take the conditions that come our way. We've prepared for them and aren't making contingency plans. We'll play the game we want to play.

'We'll keep a close eye on the players. If any of them are flagging late on, we'll change them. We have players who can come on and change the game.

'We are physically fit, mentally fit and tactically prepared. That's the most we can ever hope for.'

Gerrard said: 'It's obviously warm. It'll be a tough game. Italy are a fantastic team. But we'll be fine – we can cope. We're very fit and in good condition, prepared and focused, and we believe we can cope with these conditions.'
