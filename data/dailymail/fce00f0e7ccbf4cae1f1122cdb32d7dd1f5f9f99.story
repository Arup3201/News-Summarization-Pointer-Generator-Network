An 'incredibly lucky' lorry driver escaped with his life after his 40ft HGV toppled off a flyover and plummeted 30ft onto a busy motorway at rush hour.

The lorry came off the northbound M42 shortly before 6.30pm yesterday evening and crash-landed onto the northbound carriageway of the M6 Toll motorway, which runs beneath.

The truck is believed to have jack-knifed across all three motorway lanes and veered off the bridge after colliding with a Ford Mondeo, Warwickshire Police said.

'Amazing escape': The driver survived after his articulated lorry left the flyover on the M42 and plunged onto the M6 Toll beneath

Incredibly the driver, a man aged in his
50s, escaped with just a broken leg after crawling from the wreckage of
his cab.

He was airlifted to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital after being treated at the scene by paramedics.

The driver of the silver Ford Mondeo, 49, who had also been travelling north on the M42, also escaped unharmed.

Passing motorist Shelley Brumpton snapped the aftermath of the crash and posted the picture on Twitter.

She tweeted: 'Worst crash I've ever seen...arctic [sic] fallen off the bridge onto M6 toll. Thoughts are with family praying all ate [sic] safe.

'Horrific accident though, incredibly lucky to have made it out alive!!'

Sam Taylor, 36, who was driving on the M42 at the time of the crash, said: 'I didn't see them coming together but saw the lorry flying across the road in my wing mirror.

'When I saw it plunge over the edge down onto the motorway below I thought "that's it, he's a goner".

'I couldn't believe it when I got home and saw on the TV that no-one had been badly injured.

'It's a miracle that he didn't land on a car or cause a horrific crash on the M6 Toll, it could have killed ten or more people.

'If I was that lorry driver, I'd be putting the lottery on this weekend.'

'Miracle': No-one was badly injured when the lorry veered off the M42 flyover in Warwickshire and crash-landed on the M6 Toll 30ft below

Both the northbound M6 Toll and M42 were closed for several hours following the smash.

Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service said 1,200 litres (263 gallons) of diesel had leaked from the unladen curtain-sided lorry's fuel tank onto the carriageway near T1 of the M6 Toll.

West Midlands Ambulance Service described the driver's escape as 'amazing' after an ambulance, a paramedic rapid response vehicle and the Midlands Air Ambulance rushed to the scene.

A spokesman said: 'Ambulance crews responded to a road traffic collision following reports of a lorry coming off a flyover on the M42 and landing on the northbound M6 Toll road.

'Crews treated the lorry driver, a man in his 50s, for serious lower leg fractures, neck and back pain and facial lacerations.

'The driver crawled out of his badly damaged cab and was treated at the scene by paramedics before being airlifted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for further assessment.

'Miraculously there were no cars passing at the time - it would have been far worse if there had been.

'The M6 Toll northbound was closed as a result of the incident.'

Warwickshire Police are appealing for information from motorists who were travelling on the M42 Northbound near to junction 9 in North Warwickshire near to Coleshill, and who saw the Daf curtain sided artic, or the silver Ford Mondeo travelling northbound prior to the collision taking place.

Anyone with any information is asked to leave a message for PC Liam Ryan in the Major Incident Unit, Roads on 01926 415415.
