An ex-Ohio doctor was sentenced to 36 years in jail on Friday for the rape and involuntary manslaughter of an expectant mother forced into prostitution to support herself and two children.

Former ER doctor Ali Salim, 44, pleaded guilty to administering the fatal heroin overdose of Deanna Ballman, 23. Ballman was nine months pregnant with a girl she planned to call Mabel when she died.

Delaware County Judge Duncan Whitney 
said in sentencing him that the crime in July 2012 was the worst he's ever seen and 
that it was unthinkable that as a man of medicine, Salim allowed her to die.

Salim had faced up to 37 years in 
prison. He was given nearly that with a sentence of 36 years and four 
months; a few months are likely to be subtracted because of time he's 
already served.

When victim Ballman disappeared in July 2012, her family initially said she had answered a housekeeping ad on Craigslist.

Instead,
 investigators determined the 23-year-old woman had taken up 
prostitution when she moved back to Ohio after a divorce and with no 
financial means.

The ad she
 responded to: '$200 for a girl in need,' an online euphemism for 
prostitution, assistant Delaware County prosecutor Kyle Rohrer said in a
 court filing last week.

'That decision unknowingly but ultimately cost her and Mabel their lives,' Rohrer said.

Ballman
 died of a fatal heroin overdose, which investigators say Salim 
administered at his house in an upscale central Ohio neighborhood. 
Rohrer says there is no evidence Ballman used drugs.

In a court filing Thursday, Salim's 
attorneys contended that Ballman injected herself with the heroin, but 
Whitney rejected that, saying her character had no bearing on the crime.

They acknowledged that Salim recorded himself having sex with the incapacitated woman and later moved her body.

But they also said Salim met Ballman intending only to have sex, not to hurt her or her unborn child.

The
 defense said the court should consider Salim's previous background as a
 doctor in good standing with no criminal history. They argued he 
shouldn't receive the maximum sentence.

Salim,
 a former emergency room doctor, used Craigslist extensively to meet 
sexual partners, with many references in his ads to exchanging drugs for
 sex, including heroin, Rohrer said.

Many
 of the women were young, drug-addicted prostitutes, with several 
alleging they were drugged against their will and others saying they 
were sexually assaulted, Rohrer's filing said.

Salim
 also wrote prescriptions for hard drugs for women with whom he had 
sexual relationships, and also bought heroin that he gave women who 
visited his house.

Salim 
pleaded guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter in October. He 
also pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse.

He
 entered a type of guilty plea to a charge of rape under which he 
maintained his innocence but acknowledged prosecutors had enough 
evidence to convict him.

In
 its filing, the defense denied the allegations that other women were 
drugged and sexually assaulted.

Defense attorneys also submitted 
Craigslist postings and emails that they say show Ballman solicited sex 
online.

Salim told 
investigators that Ballman was alive when she left the house and he 
drove her to a nearby grocery store parking lot where he gave her 
directions to get home.

Salim
 claims he then walked back to his house, according to Rohrer. Ballman's
 body was found the next day in the back of her car on a rural road a 
few miles from Salim's house.

Investigators
 say video evidence shows Ballman nude and unconscious on Salim's bed, 
apparently suffering distress consistent with a heroin overdose, Rohrer 
said.

She didn't leave
 the house alive, according to the court filing, which said Salim left 
to get heroin in a neighboring suburb that evening while Ballman was 
still in the house.

Rohrer's filing notes that Salim neglected his professional duty to help Ballman.

'Without
 regard for mother or child, he dumped their bodies in a remote location
 as if he was taking out his trash,' the filing said.

Whitney
 has ordered video, audio and photographic evidence destroyed after 
criminal and civil cases against Salim end, agreeing with prosecutors 
they are obscene and depict acts that Ballman couldn't have consented 
to.

Salim used Craigslist 
extensively to meet sexual partners, with many references in his ads to 
exchanging drugs for sex, including heroin, the filing said.

Many
 of the women were young, drug-addicted prostitutes, with several 
alleging they were drugged against their will and others saying they 
were sexually assaulted, the filing said.

Salim
 also wrote prescriptions for hard drugs for women with whom he had 
sexual relationships, and bought heroin that he gave women who visited 
his house in an upscale neighborhood.

A message was left for Salim's attorney, Sam Shamansky, who previously alleged Ballman was a prostitute feeding a drug habit.

Ballman, 23, died of a fatal heroin overdose, but there is no evidence she was a drug user, Rohrer said.
