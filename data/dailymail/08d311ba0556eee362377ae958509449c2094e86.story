It was supposed to be the place where Stephanie Scott was to spend the happiest day of her life, instead her wedding venue seemed like the loneliest place on the planet.

A guest list of 120 people had been invited to Stephanie and her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley's wedding at the picturesque Eat Your Greens venue 2km outside the tiny town of Eugowra, in New South Wales' central west region.

These same guests were now 275km and three hours' drive away after attending a heart-breaking ceremony at Mountford Park in Leeton, as Stephanie's family and friends honoured the 26-year-old teacher's memory.

The popular high school teacher was last seen on Easter Sunday, which sparked a widespread search until police found the remains of a body at a national park on Friday - the day before Ms Scott's big day.

But on Saturday, the wedding venue was locked up and deserted as guests instead paid tribute to Ms Scott at her memorial service which was held 275km and three hours' drive away from Eat Your Greens

The car park was empty and silent, with only the sound of crickets and toads in the nearby countryside. 

The planned wedding venue was locked up and the car park was empty and silent, with only the sound of crickets and toads in the nearby countryside.

The grounds surrounding the premises were immaculate, and in the middle there was a hallway of trees that looked like an aisle.

You could imagine guests chatting happily around the grounds.

The only sign that Stephanie's wedding was due to take place there was a touching memorial at the venue's entrance, which was made up of flower bouquets and yellow balloons

'Generally the place is lively with people enjoying themselves on a Saturday night. There's always something going on there. I was wondering why it was so quiet,' one neighbour said

Tributes to Ms Scott were left at the gates of her wedding venue. Her big day was supposed to take place on Saturday

But it was pointless to think of what could have been - where there should have been laughter there was now only an eerie stillness.

It was a haunting place, and one that a neighbour - who asked not to be named - had not seen the like of for a while.

'Generally the place is lively with people enjoying themselves on a Saturday night. There's always something going on there. I was wondering why it was so quiet,' he said.

Messages on the cards read 'Always in our hearts Steph xxx' and 'Love you and miss you but we know you'll be our soulmate'

One message attached to a bouquet of flowers from the owners of the Eat Your Greens venue itself, summed up perfectly how everybody felt after a traumatic day: 'Steph, words cannot even describe how devastated we are. You truly were a beautiful person, a pleasure to get to know and you would have made a beautiful bride.'

The popular teacher had been reported missing since Easter Sunday as police found her body on Friday - the day before her wedding 

On Thursday, Ms Scott's fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley visited the makeshift memorial erected outside the school his partner of five years had taught English and drama.

The popular high school teacher was honoured with cards, flowers, balloons, candles, and pictures as students from the school, along with friends, family, and strangers visited to remember the 26-year-old.

Many of Ms Scott's friends and family had travelled from interstate and overseas for the wedding, but stayed for the memorial instead, in the wake of the news that police had discovered a body on Friday night they believed to be that of the 26-year-old.

Detective Superintendent Michael Rowan, local area commander at Griffith, said that the body found just metres from the road in Cocoparra National Park, in the Riverina region of NSW, had been burned. 

The remains of the body have been taken to Glebe infirmary for further forensics.

Police also said that a gasoline can had been found at the site.  

Police have charged school cleaner Vincent Stanford, 24, with the 26-year-old teacher's murder and will allege Stanford killed Ms Scott at some point between 11am and 7.20pm on Sunday, before dumping her car and body.
