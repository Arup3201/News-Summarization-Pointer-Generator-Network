Comic strip book Hipster Hitler has turned the Nazi dictator into trendy geek wearing black-rimmed glasses and a cardigan (pictured)

A ‘jokey’ comic strip book called Hipster Hitler which turns the murderous Nazi dictator into a trendy geek has sparked outrage among the Jewish community.

The widely available book shows the former German Chancellor wearing black-rimmed glasses, eating cashew nuts, playing Pac-Man and riding a bike with a basket on the handlebars.

A group of Jewish activists has pledged to shred all the copies of the comic strip, which it says is ‘anti-Semitic’ and ‘sick’.

Shania Angel, a member of London Stands with Israel - and whose grandmother died in the Holocaust - has said the group plans to boycott stores which sell the book.

Miss Angel, 23, told the Ham & High newspaper: ‘The book is a disgrace and should be banned.

‘T-shirts are now being sold of Hipster Hitler - it's turning Hitler into a cute and trendy character.

‘It's offensive to people like me who have had family members killed in the Holocaust.’

She added: ‘Anti-Semitism has skyrocketed recently and we shouldn't be selling books like this.

‘We should boycott shops that sell it, we should protest outside their stores and do everything we can to make sure these aren't being sold.’

Ilana Katz, a fellow member of the group, said: ‘If we can't get shops to stop selling copies we'll buy and shred them all.

‘Since when was it okay to promote Hitler as a cool person?’

But the New York-based authors James Carr and Archana Kumar say the book is a ‘parody’ and is not intended to offend anyone.

They state: ‘None of the views expressed should be confused with the actual views of the authors, advertisers, the hosting company, any service providers or the owner of this domain name.

‘Everything... is intended to spoof, parody and satirise. We make no claims as to the accuracy of our satire.

‘HipsterHitler.com uses the names of public figures for purposes of satire only.’

The images, including this one showing him riding a bike with a basket on the handlebars towards field marshal Rommel, have sparked outrage among the Jewish community who say the book is 'sick'

The book, which was published after becoming a success online, is described as a 'notorious, irreverent strip' which 'reveals how today's subculture personalities fetishise the authentic to create a new variety of conformism'.

It states: ‘Using a combination of puns, parody, dark humour and visual gags, the exploits of the Third Reich and the activities of the everyday Hipster are lampooned in a knowing fashion.

‘The online strip has garnered huge numbers of fans with an acerbic deconstruction of the hipster urban tribe.’

The dictator is also pictured wearing slogan t-shirt 'Save the Panzer' and  arguing with his Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, calling him a 'kibitzer' - a Yiddish term for someone giving unwanted advice 

However, CK, a publisher at Jewlicious.com, writing a post on the site about the book said: 'It’s kind of creepy perhaps but frankly, anything that ridicules Hitler I figure is pretty good for the Jews. And for mankind.' 

Various comic strips from the book - which is being sold on Amazon and in book stores like Waterstones for £12.99 - include Hitler saying he doesn't like 'Kosher salt', wearing a t-shirt stating 'Death Camp for Cutie', 'Save the Panzer' and '1941: A Race Odyssey'.

The dictator is also pictured arguing with his Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, calling him a 'kibitzer' - a Yiddish term for someone giving unwanted advice - for interrupting him, eating cashew nuts and wearing a beanie hat. 

Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and a dictator of Nazi Germany in 1934. His reign came to an end in 1945 when he took his own life. 

He was a veteran of World War I before he joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party and eventually became leader in 1921.

The Nazis wanted to maintain the purity of the 'Aryan Race' and sought to get rid of people they considered 'subhuman'.

Around six million Jews were systematically murdered during the Nazi regime under the command of  Hitler, in what became known as the Holocaust.

Nazis also persecuted and killed millions of people including approximately three million Ukranians, over two million Poles as well as Slavic, Soviets and Romani people.

People with mental disorders and disabilities, homosexuals, political opponents and religious dissidents such as the Jehovah's Witnesses were also killed. 

Figures suggest the total death toll of the genocide stands at around 17 million.
