He is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, but it seems the remarkable career of Tom Brady may be coming to a crashing halt.

Only four games into the season, the New England Patriots star and owner of three Super Bowl rings has been putting up abysmal numbers, resulting in two losses for his team, an early season rarity for the storied dynasty. 

Even worse, the Patriots second-string quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, replaced Brady in last night's game against the Kansas City Chiefs, and looked like the far more experienced and capable player of the two.

Stats: In the first four game, the quartback great has thrown for only four touchdowns and 791 yards

All this has many wondering if Brady, and the Patriots', reign as the best in the NFL is coming to an end. 

Since their shocking Super Bowl win in 2001, Brady and the Patriots have posted numbers unlike any team in the history of football, with five Super Bowl appearances in just 11 seasons and three Super Bowl wins, as well as becoming the only team since the league expanded the regular season to 16 games in 1978 to go undefeated back in 2007.

The force behind all of this has been Brady, who, at 37, is one of only two players, alongside Joe Montana, in NFL history to win the NFL Most Valuable Player and Super Bowl MVP awards multiple times. 

He also holds the record for postseason passing yards, places third on the list for postseason touchdowns, and has won an astonishing 148 regular season games and 18 postseason games, numbers that are even more impressive considering he was one of the last players picked in the 2000 draft.

This season however is a far different story, with the man who was long believed by many to be untouchable posting numbers that are no doubt causing major concern for his boss, and biggest champion, Patriots coach Bill Belichick. 

He is completing just 59 percent of his passes and has only 791 yards, and four touchdowns, in the first four games of the season.

Last night against the Chiefs he had only 159 yards before he was pulled from the game by Belichick, this after his second interception.

And the Chiefs did not just beat the Patriots, they routed the team, going up 41 - 7 at one point, the most Brady has ever been down in a game. 

No doubt making matters much, much worse for Brady was the performance of Garoppolo last night, whose story as the good looking backup who comes in to save the day and plays remarkably cool under pressure is eerily similar to the one that played out between Brady and former Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe back in 2001.

That being said, this is still the Patriots,the one team that should never be counted out.

They started the 2001 season at 0-2 before going on to win the Super Bowl, and Belichick and Brady still remain perhaps the greatest tandem in the history of the sport, or any sport for that matter.

Of course, if things don't get better for Brady, there's no need to feel too concerned for the man.

He signed a five-year, $57 million contract in 2013 meaning he will likely play through the 2017 season.

Furthermore, his wife, and mother to his two children, Benjamin and Vivian, is 34-year-old Gisele Bundchen, one of the most successful models of all time who is still without question at the top of her game, having just opened the Chanel show in Paris earlier today.

And there is no question that no matter what happens this season or next season or the season after that, Brady will go down as one of the greatest to play the game
