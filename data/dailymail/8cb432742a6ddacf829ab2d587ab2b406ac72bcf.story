Top military officials have been warned not to have sex with attractive women in Russia or China in case they are spies, it has been reported.

A leaked document says agents of the FSB, Russia's intelligence service and successor to the Soviet-era KGB, could attempt to lure British officials into bed and then blackmail them.

The document, the Ministry of Defence Manual of Security, warns senior officers that the FSB, could gain valuable intelligence by exploiting 'knowledge of marital infidelity or sexual activity the target may wish to hide'.

The KGB used 'honey traps' like this extensively during the Cold War, using both men and women to target those they believed to have valuable information.

The Communist East German security services targeted young men to seduce middle-aged West German secretaries working for senior officials.

So convincing were these young men that one woman who was told her lover had been a spy that she refused to believe it, stating: 'He did really love me.'

One senior military official told the Sunday Times how a very attractive blonde woman in her early 30s approached him in a St Petersburg hotel and began chatting about how she loved vintage British sports cars - the man's hobby. 

She flirted with him and he suddenly became suspicious and left suddenly.

He said: 'I think i said something very awkward like "sorry, it's my bedtime" and scarpered. I put it down as a close shave.' 

A Ministry of Defence spokesperson refused to comment on the report.

In 2010 Russian Katia Zatuliveter was accused of being a Kremlin spy after it emerged she had had an affair with Commons Defence Committee MP Mike Hancock.

She denied the claim and later won an appeal against deportation from the UK.

The scandal came after a ring of 10 Russian spies were rounded up and deported from the US.

One of the spies, Anna Chapman, had lived and worked in London before marrying and gaining a British passport.

In 2009 an American diplomat in Moscow was embroiled in a sex scandal after footage apparently showing him with a prostitute was released on the internet.

The married envoy, a second secretary, was named as Kyle Hatcher by two Russian newspapers which reported unconfirmed claims that he was a CIA undercover agent.

Russian newspapers were apparently tipped off about the footage, suggesting that the FSB was behind it.

The U.S. Embassy in Moscow complained to the Russian Foreign Ministry about the tape and the State Department said the video was a fabricated montage that includes some real footage of Mr Hatcher, a married diplomatic liaison to Russian religious and human rights groups.

Meanwhile, Britain’s spy chiefs have launched a recruitment drive for Russian-speaking agents amid mounting tensions with the Kremlin.

MI5, responsible for protecting the UK against terror attacks and other security threats, has placed an advert on its website calling for Russian language specialists to apply.

The drive comes amid warnings of a new Cold War between Russia and the West as tensions continue to rise over the military stand-off in Ukraine.

Up to 50 Russian spies are said to be operating in Britain, with ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans claiming there has been ‘no decrease in the number of undeclared Russian intelligence officers in the UK’ since the end of the Cold War. 

The new recruitment campaign is being run jointly with Government’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ, which gathers intelligence for the Government and Armed Forces by tapping phones and monitoring the internet.
