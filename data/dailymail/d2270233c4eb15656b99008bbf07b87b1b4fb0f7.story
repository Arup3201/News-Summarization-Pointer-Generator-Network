Inspiration: Laughlin Whiteley was just four when he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour

A boy of seven who was given an award by Prince Harry for his brave fight against cancer has died.

Laughlin Whiteley was just four when he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour.

The tumour was removed but he had to have a bone marrow transplant after he developed leukemia, a rare complication of chemotherapy. He was given the all clear in March.

But his cancer returned in September, a week before the charity WellChild named Laughlin the Most Inspirational Child of The Year, an award presented to him by Prince Harry. 

Over the past nine weeks Laughlin’s condition deteriorated and he was given a morphine drip in a bid to ease his pain.

On Saturday his parents said he had passed away surrounded by his family.

His mother Andrea Poyser, 43, from Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, wrote on Facebook: ‘Pain free, fly high my angel of sunflowers. You brave strong warrior, I know you have entered heaven surrounded by love.’

Last month, national charity for sick children WellChild named Laughlin as its Most Inspirational Child of the Year.

Prince Harry presented him with the award at a London hotel after the youngster received hundreds of nominations for the title.

The family set up the Unlock a Life For Lockey charity this year to encourage people to sign up to the bone marrow register.

The charity also set up 'The Happy Shack', a beach hut on the seafront in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex.

They offer free use of the newly fitted-out hut to families with a child who has recently been in treatment for cancer or leukaemia.
