Charlene Dowsell, 28 who is banned from having more than two friends in her home - to stop her holding all-night parties

A woman has been banned from having more than two friends in her home to stop her holding noisy all-night parties.

Charlene Dowsell, 28, enraged neighbours with the late night gatherings she regularly threw at her flat for her friends.

A court heard how up to 20 people would arrive in a van for the parties, which were held nightly during the summer.

The rave music was so loud it could be heard from neighbouring streets and lasted until 7am.

Now Ms Dowsell is only allowed to have two friends at night in her two-bedroom flat inNewport, Wales, after police went to court to get a two-year Anti-social behaviour order (Asbo) placed on her.

A police spokesman said: 'As well as the noise, party-goers would frequently become aggressive, shouting and swearing in the street.

'On one occasion two men became embroiled in a fight which involved jumping on parked cars.

'Litter was also thrown into a communal yard, including lit cigarettes, bottles and empty clear plastic bags which police say are often associated with drugs use.'

Under the order, Ms Dowsell is banned from having more than two additional people into her address between 7pm and 7am. She is also banned from playing loud music which can be heard outside her flat.

Magistrates in Cwmbran, Gwent, heard that if she breaches the order Dowsell faces up to five years in prison.

PC
Paula Spence, Crime and Disorder Reduction Officer for Newport, said: 
'We hope this Asbo reassures residents and sends a clear message to 
those acting in an anti-social manner, that this type of behaviour will 
not be tolerated.

'We
will use every type of legislation available to stop this type of 
activity and ensure that residents in Newport can live in peace.'
