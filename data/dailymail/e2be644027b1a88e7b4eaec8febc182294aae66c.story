The mother of a 19-year-old student who was killed in an accident in 2012 has penned an emotional open letter to her late son's classmates as they prepare to graduate from college.

Still mourning the death of her beloved son Luke Voss-Kernan - who died on a cross-country road trip with friends after falling from a structure he had climbed - Massachusetts woman Gisela Voss decided to pen some words to Luke's friends on his behalf.

The mom first wrote a note to Luke, tearfully describing how much she continues to miss him, before putting together a moving missive for his peers, posting both of them to her Facebook page, The Boston Globe reported.

Channeling her grief: Gisela Voss (right) as penned an open letter to the graduating classmates of her son, Luke Coss-Kernan (left), who died in a climbing accident in 2012. Luke would have been graduating college this year with his friends

Incredibly-touching tribute: Gisela Voss said she wakes up everyday and relives the realization her son Luke is dead. She has now written a gorgeous letter from his perspective

Voss begins the poignant letter to her son by trying to explain how much she misses him, writing: 'I will be longing for you as long as I live.'

Luke, a 2010 graudate from Newton South High School in Newton, Massachusetts, 'was on a dream road trip to California having the time of his life' when he fell from an old fuel tank inside an abandoned gasification plant.

He was in a fenced-off area of Gas Works Park in Seattle just after midnight when the accident occurred on May 25, 2012, according to Detective Mark Jamieson of the Seattle Police Department.

People would often scale the fences to climb the old gas plant structures still standing in the park, boston.com reported at the time.

It has now been two years since's Luke's death.

'I still wake up e-v-e-r-y-s-i-n-g-l-e-m-o-r-n-i-n-g to the newfound realization that you are dead,' his mother wrote in her letter.

'I relive the panic and the disbelief that you could already be gone this long.'

However Voss becomes the most impassioned when addressing the classmates and friends that Luke left behind.

In her incredibly-touching second letter, she tells them not to take anything for granted, to embrace life and enjoy it, and to never forget that 'tomorrow is not a guarantee'.

'I’m not saying don’t plan for a future that might never come,' the letter says.

'But use the fragile nature of our every day to propel you to always, always, ALWAYS . . . choose dreams over doldrums, adventure over avarice, memories over money, friends over . . . heck, over everything else.'

Tragic: Luke Voss-Kernan, a 2010 graduate of Newton South High School, died May 25, 2012, when he fell from an abandoned fuel tank at Gas Works Park in Seattle

Luke would have been graduating from college this year. His mother took it upon herself to pen a letter to Luke's classmates on his behalf

I laugh every time I think I’m never going to talk to you again because it sounds like the stupidest thing in the world.

How can I exist in a world that doesn’t include you?

I miss the sound of your voice.

Your wrecked skater shoes thrown all around.

The smell of your incense on your ratty sweat shirt.

I will be longing for you as long as I live.

This time of year feels so heavy.

The two-year mark of your departure (who the **** can call that an “anniversary”) is coming, and the dread had set in before I even turned the calendar page.

I still wake up e-v-e-r-y-s-i-n-g-l-e-m-o-r-n-i-n-g to the newfound realization that you are dead.

I relive the panic and the disbelief that you could already be gone this long.

Gone to where we cannot follow, until I have finished all of my days.

And yet life — this life, at least — keeps chugging along.

Most of your high school friends are graduating, Luke, and it’s not that I begrudge them their milestones . . . it’s just that on top of missing you, I am missing yours.

So ... by way of channeling my grief into something positive, I dare write a letter to your classmates finishing college ...

Dear friends,

To all of you becoming teachers, neuroscientists, musicians, doctors, artists, lawyers, lions, tigers, and bears — (oh, my!) — becoming ADULTS . . .

How lucky you are to have the venerable privilege of finishing college.

Of standing on the cusp of adulthood with the world wide open and ready for your contributions.

For the utter gift of your presence here among us.

Your presence in the present.

Have you any idea, really, how extraordinary just that fact alone is?

How the very breath you’re taking without paying any mind to it is a blessing denied to many?

Close your eyes for at least one minute each day.

Count 60 breaths and marvel at the preponderance of possibilities before you.

Then vow when you open your eyes to remember, for a moment, that tomorrow is not a guarantee.

Don’t let that thought paralyze you.

I’m not saying don’t plan for a future that might never come.

But use the fragile nature of our every day to propel you to always, always, ALWAYS . . . choose dreams over doldrums, adventure over avarice, memories over money, friends over . . . heck, over everything else.

Speaking of memories and friends.

Never pass up the opportunity to make some of each.

Both nourish the soul.

Especially together.

Embrace their gifts and treasures.

Memories can bring happiness or sadness, but because they are a part of you they cannot be taken away.

Relish all of them.

Squander none of them . . . the mistakes you’ll make, the bosses and jobs you’ll hate, the mentors and jobs you’ll love, the wrinkles you’ll grow, the babies you’ll birth, the years you will live — the-years-you-will-live.

Give love and receive love.

Boldly. Freely. Unapologetically.

Love is the only thing KNOWN to survive death.

If you feel it, say it.

Risk it. Hearts can heal from unrequited love, but not from regret.

Look up from your digital gizmos and look into each other’s eyes.

Be present with each other — and with the unknown. Ask the big questions.

Stand long enough to actually hear the answer to “How are you?” Sit long enough to ponder the answer to “Who are you?”

Be happy, pig-in-**** happy, for what you have.

Even when you have little. Or when you think you have little.

Because just by graduating from college and reading this missive you have so much more than most people on the planet will ever have, or have ever had. Including time.

TIME to be happy, fall in love, fall out of love, ride a bike, fall off a bike, get back on, write a song or symphony, paint a painting, pop a wheelie, stand in awe.

That’s it really. In three words.

Stand in awe.
