A human foot still wearing its athletic shoe washed onto a San Francisco beach Sunday morning.

A black size 11.5 Puma sneaker contained the extremely decayed remains and no signs of the rest of the body were found.

National Park Service personnel found the foot after a beachgoer called to report the gruesome sighting.

Horror: This Puma containing a decayed human foot was found on a San Francisco beach Sunday. No sign of the rest of the body was found

'What we have is a human foot, with some associated tissue, inside of a shoe,' Mark Powning, an investigator with the city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, told the San Francisco Chronicle.

The find at the city's Ocean Beach, while gory, is not all that uncommon.

According to SFist, at least 13 or 14 such feet were found in the Pacific Northwest between 2007 and 2012.

One theory about the origin of the feet--and their lack of a body--is that the shoe somehow protects the foot from being eaten or fully decomposing.

Long gone: The gruesome discovery was made at Ocean Beach in San Francisco. Experts say the foot was likely rolling around on the ocean floor for a long time

As the body decays, the foot may detach and float away, eventually washing onto shore.

This can even happen many years after death. Two feet that came ashore in 2011 were traced to a suicide in Vancouver from seven years prior.

Mark Powning suggested something similar in the case of the San Francisco foot.

'It probably was rolling around the seabed for awhile,' he said.
