Authorities have charged a central Missouri man with first-degree murder after a 13-year-old girl who had been reported missing was found dead on an unoccupied farm.

Steven Neal Henderson, 30, of Iberia was charged in the Saturday stabbing death of Macala Shelton, according to court records released on Monday.

Macala had been reported missing that day by her grandmother. Authorities said Henderson lived at the same address as the teenager.

Stabbed: of Macala Shelton, 13, was found in a wooded area of an unoccupied farm near Iberia, Missouri. She had been stabbed with a survival knife

A probable cause statement by the Missouri State Highway Patrol said Henderson acknowledged killing the girl with a large survival knife and told authorities where to find the weapon.

According to posts on Facebook, Henderson had attended his sister Lisa’s wedding Saturday, where he served as the best man.

Early the next morning, Macala was discovered missing by her grandmother, who had gone to wake her.

Later on Sunday, Macala's body was found nearby in a wooded area on an unoccupied farm.

Family feud: Steven Henderson, who was Macala's step-uncle has been charged with her murder. He told police where the body was located

Miller County Sheriff William M. 'Bill' Abbott said during a news conference Monday he did not have information about the possible motive and could not discuss details of Henderson’s statement.

'If we didn’t have enough to charge for murder-one, we wouldn’t,' he said.

Abbott told reporters on Monday the teen’s body was found several miles from her home. He said Henderson led authorities in the direction but did not lead them to the body.

He described Henderson as the brother of Macala’s step-father.

Iberia, which has a little more than 700 residents, is about 45 miles south of Jefferson City in a largely rural area.

The
sheriff’s office said authorities had interviewed family members and 
friends about Macala’s whereabouts after a door-to-door search with help
from the Iberia Volunteer Fire Department and residents.

Abbott said the way Henderson answered a few questions and his actions had concerned investigators.

Family home: Both Micala and Henderson lived at this house in Iberia, Missouri

Abbott
said he is awaiting results from an autopsy and that the investigation 
is continuing. The sheriff’s office said no additional charges currently
are expected.

No one 
answered a phone call Monday at a number listed as Henderson’s address. 
Henderson, who is being held in the Miller County jail, filed an 
application on Monday to be represented by a public defender but one had
not yet been assigned, according to online court records. The Miller 
County Sheriff’s Office said Henderson was being held on a $500,000 
bond.

An endangered person 
advisory described Macala as 5-feet 1-inch with brown hair and eyes and 
back-framed glasses. She was seen going to bed Friday before midnight 
and was not in her room when her grandmother went to wake her Saturday.

Charged: Steven Henderson, 30, is charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action for the stabbing of Macala Shelton, 13. Henderson is a step-uncle of Macala.

Iberia,
which has a little more than 700 residents, is about 45 miles south of 
Jefferson City in a largely rural area. Abbott spoke to reporters at the
Miller County Sheriff’s Office in Tuscumbia.

Betty
Cochran, a neighbor who had interacted with the family, said Macala 
moved to Iberia this past school year with her stepfather and siblings 
after her mother was deployed by the military.

They lived with the stepfather’s parents and his siblings, she said.

Macala played softball and liked to read, Cochran said.

Brutal: Macala was apparently stabbed to death by her step-uncle Steven Henderson with a survival knife such as the one pictured

'They’ve
been good neighbors, they’re friendly people. And them kids, I just 
love them all,' Cochran said. 'It sure has been a thing for me to 
swallow. It’s been a hard thing for me to take.'

Abbott said he plans to meet with Macala’s mother and father on Tuesday.

Macala’s
mother, Melissa, had posted the Amber Alert on her Facebook page, with a
post that says, 'This is my daughter. Please bring her home. Let us 
know if you know anything. I’m coming home on emergency leave from 
[Afghanistan]. Please help.'

A
probable cause statement written by a Miller County sheriff’s detective
said more than 20 firearms were found during a search of the residence 
where the family lived.

Court records list Henderson's address in Iberia as the same one where Macala lived. He is being held on a $500,000 bond.
