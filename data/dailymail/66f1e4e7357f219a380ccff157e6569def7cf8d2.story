Rebekah Brooks, Rupert Murdoch and his son James have been called to appear before a powerful Commons committee next Tuesday.

Labour's Tom Watson said MPs wanted to ask Mrs Brooks about her knowledge of payments to the police.

He said the Culture, Media and Sport select committee also wants to quiz James Murdoch on his involvement 'in authorising payments to silence' Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, after his phone was hacked.

Rupert Murdoch owes the Dowler family an apology, Mr Watson added.

Rupert Murdoch was urged to bow to the will of Parliament today after it emerged that all three main parties are set to back a call for him to abandon his takeover bid for BSkyB.

The Tories and the Liberal Democrats said they would be supporting a motion tabled by Labour leader Ed Miliband (who met the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler today, below) when it comes before MPs tomorrow.

The text insists it is 'in the public interest for Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation to withdraw their bid for BSkyB'.

Mr Miliband said: 'I welcome news that the Government says it will support our motion. It is now for Rupert Murdoch to recognise the strength of public feeling and the will of all the major parties.'

The development comes as the Prime Minister, his Liberal Democrat deputy Nick Clegg and Mr Miliband prepare to hold talks this evening on the phone-hacking scandal.

Labour has called a debate on the row on one of the regular Opposition Days, when it has the opportunity to determine the subject for discussion on the floor of the House of Commons. News Corp's bid to buy the 61 per cent of shares in the satellite broadcaster which it does not already own was referred to the Competition Commission by Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday.

Support for the motion will give Mr Hunt more strength in sticking up for public opposition to the takeover, Mr Miliband said.

He said: 'Jeremy Hunt will get a chance to make a decision about the public interest at the end of this process, once it comes back from the Competition Commission.

'We think that if the House of Commons expresses a clear view about what is in the public interest - for the bid to be withdrawn - then that will help him in making the right call.'

Mr Hunt is not expected to take part in the vote tomorrow. David Cameron's spokesman said the Government was 'intending to support' the call tomorrow.

Asked whether the Government believed that News Corp should heed the will of Parliament, the spokesman replied: 'Ultimately, that is a decision for News Corp but we would always expect people to take seriously what Parliament has said.'

Sources close to Mr Clegg confirmed that his Liberal Democrats would also be voting in favour. The vote will follow the Opposition Day debate tabled by Labour.

Rupert Murdoch owes the Dowler family an apology, Mr Watson added.

He told Radio 4's World at One 
programme: 'They have misled Parliament, egregiously, over time, they 
have misled the country and they have misled their readers and I think 
it is incumbent on MPs to get to the facts.

'Asked
whether the News International trio would be compelled to attend, Mr 
Watson said there was lots of 'arcane procedure' to go through but 
added: 'We will be sitting next Tuesday and we expect them to attend.

'I suspect that some of them might be too cowardly to turn up but that is up to them to decide.'

Mr
Watson, a leading campaigner on phone hacking, dismissed claims that 
the criminal investigation meant they would not be able to quiz the 
executives.

'As far as I 
know the three individuals concerned are not the subject of a criminal 
investigation, none of them have been arrested,' he added.

'So
it is not unreasonable for us to ask them why the information their 
senior executives gave us in a previous parliamentary inquiry was 
actually untrue.'

News International said today it would co-operate with the committee.
A spokesman for News International, publisher of the News of the 
World, the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times, could not confirm 
whether all three would attend the hearing.

But the company said in a statement: 'We
have been made aware of the request from the CMS committee to interview
senior executives and will co-operate. We await the formal invitation.'

A spokeswoman for the CMS committee said it had submitted a 'polite request' for the NI executives to appear before it.

If they refuse, MPs could choose to 'compel' Rebekah Brooks to give 
evidence, although it was unclear whether that action would be able to 
be taken against the Murdochs because they are not British citizens, she
added.

The committee could make a report to the House if witnesses continued to
refuse to turn up and the Speaker would then decide whether to refer 
the matter to the Standards and Privilege Committee, which would decide 
if it wanted to investigate.

The most likely punishment would be a fine but any action is rare and MPs would be on 'untested ground', the spokeswoman added.

Tory
MP John Whittingdale, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 
said: 'In light of the extraordinary developments this week around phone
hacking, serious questions have arisen about the evidence given to the 
committee by a number of witnesses in its previous inquiry into press 
standards, libel and privacy.

'In
particular, James Murdoch has said that Parliament was misled. That is a
very serious matter that we will not allow to go unquestioned.

'We are therefore today calling James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch, and Rebekah Brooks to appear before us next week.'
