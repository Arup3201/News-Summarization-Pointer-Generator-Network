Scam? Christina Lee Jensen, 36, pictured, was arrested Friday after a 17 month investigation by Fairview Township police

A Pennsylvania woman is accused of scamming a couple desperate to have a baby out of thousands of dollars when she agreed to act as a surrogate mother for them.

Christina Lee Jensen, 36, was arrested Friday after a 17 month investigation by Fairview Township police.

She's facing charges of forgery, theft by deception and other offenses, according to a statement. The victims, a couple from Maryland, first reported the woman to police in August 2012 after they became suspicious that Jensen wasn't being truthful, police said.

The couple, who haven't been identified, said they chose Jensen to be their gestational carrier around May 2011 and she signed a surrogacy agreement.

But they soon came to believe she had ulterior motives and contacted authorities, telling them they were being victimized by her.

Police began probing Jensen's activity.

Months later, they determined that she had forged an attorney's signature, but also fabricated several legal documents, receipts and emails.

In all, she defrauded the couple out of $4,300, the police statement says.

Jensen was charged with forgery, theft by deception, receiving stolen property and unlawful use of a computer, according to court records.

She was released after posting $70,000 bail but is waiting for a preliminary hearing date.

Surrogacy laws vary state by state. In Pennsylvania, no law regulates surrogacy.

Intended parents often find surrogate mothers through agencies, and are generally compensated up to $20,000 and $25,000 for a single fetus and an additional $3000 to $5000 for a multiple birth.

It's not clear whether the couple found Jensen through such an agency or how much they had agreed to pay her in total for the birth.
