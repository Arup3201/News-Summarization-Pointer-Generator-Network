President Barack Obama's aunt Zeituni 
Onyango - who was denied asylum in the United States but remained in the country illegally
 for years - died on Tuesday at age 61.

Onyango, whose immigration status first hit headlines days before Obama's election in 2008, had been 
treated in recent months for cancer and respiratory problems, Cleveland 
attorney Margaret Wong said.

She died in a Boston rehabilitation center,
 said Wong, who represented her immigration case.

President Barack Obama's aunt Zeituni Onyango - seen here at her Boston home in 2009 -  died on Tuesday, April 8, 2014. She was 61.

Onyango, a half-sister of Obama's late father, 
moved from Kenya to the U.S. in 2000 and was denied asylum by an 
immigration judge in 2004.

She remained in the country illegally, living
 in Boston public housing.

She finally was granted asylum in 2010 by a judge 
who said she could be in danger if she returned to Kenya because of her 
relationship with Obama.

Onyango was born in Kenya in May 1952 under a mango
 tree and was delivered by a midwife, Wong said.

She raised a family in 
Kenya and worked in the computer department of Kenya Breweries, she 
said.

'She was an awesome, funny, shrewd, smart lady born
 at the wrong place at the wrong time,' Wong said.

'If she was only born
 in America or born in more Western open society instead of being bogged
 down by tribes, lineage and being a woman in Kenya, she could have been
 anything she wanted to be.'

Mourning: Obama, who is yet to comment on the death of his aunt, did not step in to help with her immigration case so as to not abuse his political power

Wong said Onyango had become ill in January and died early Tuesday morning in her sleep.

The White House, which had no immediate reaction to
 Onyango's death on Tuesday, had said previously that Obama did not 
intervene in her immigration case.

Obama, in his memoir Dreams from My Father: A 
Story of Race and Inheritance, affectionately referred to Onyango as 
Auntie Zeituni and described meeting her during his 1988 trip to Kenya.

She helped care for his half-brothers and sister while living with his 
father, Barack Obama Sr., in Kenya.
