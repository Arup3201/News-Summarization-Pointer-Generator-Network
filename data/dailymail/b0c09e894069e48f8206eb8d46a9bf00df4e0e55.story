Amanda Knox has responded to an Italian court's latest decision to reconvict her of murder, saying the decision is not based hard evidence.

In an interview with CNN, Knox was mostly composed as she explained her legal defense and her frustration with the court's consideration of circumstantial over forensic evidence.

But she became emotional several times, tearing up, when she talked about the relationship she had with British roommate Meredith Kercher.

'I did not kill my friend. I did not wield a knife. I had no reason to,' she said.

Never-ending legal battle: Speaking with CNN on Thursday, Amanda Knox again state that she didn't kill her British roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007

Close: The 26-year-old from Seattle, Washington got emotional as she spoke about Kercher, saying she wouldn't have killer her friend

The 26-year-old was first found guilty of murdering Meredith Kercher back in 2007. That conviction was thrown out four years later and Knox was allowed to return home to the United States.

Victim: Knox was first convicted of killing British roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007. She was allowed to return to the United States four years later when that decision was overturned. But the case was brought up again this year

But the case was brought up again this year and on Tuesday an Italian court issued a 337-page report, which finds that Knox stabbed Kercher to death in a fight over money.

According to the report, known as a 
'motivation' of the sentence, Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound to
 Kercher, a student at Leeds University.

The document states: 'It
 is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events 
accelerated; the English girl was attacked by Amanda Marie Knox, by 
Raffaele Sollecito, who was backing up his girlfriend, and by Rudy 
Hermann Guede, and constrained within her own room.'

It adds that it's difficult to establish a reason for the brutal slaying
 of Ms Kercher, but goes on to cite allegations of tension between Knox and the student.

It also refers to a statement that Guede made to police that Ms Kercher believed
 Knox stole 300 euros (£246) - and two credits cards - from her, 
which is described as a ‘valid motive’ for the murder.

Knox is dumbfounded by the court's conclusions, saying she saved up money to go to Italy and wasn't financially strained.

That's compared to Rudy Guede, who was seperately convicted of Kercher's murder and testified in this latest case.

Couple: Knox and Socellito served four years in prison before being acquitted and released. However, they were reconvicted by the Florence appeals court on January 30, and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively

Knox says he was 'a known thief, a known burglar who did this on a regular basis to survive'.

Jailed: Rudy Hermann Guede is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder of Ms Kercher

She also finds it disheartening that the court seems to value his testimony more than hers.

The
 latest trial also points to DNA evidence found of Knox and then 
boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito at the crime scene, which she says is 
unspurising considering she lived there for a month.

The crucial difference between Knox and Guede, she says, is that his DNA was mixed up with Kercher's.

'If I were there, I would have traces of Meredith's broken body on me and I would have left traces of myself around Meredith's corpse,' she said. 'And I am not there and that proves my innocence.

Knox is currently appealing the case from the United States and it will next go to the High Court.

The judge who originally ruled out Knox's conviction responded to the latest decision as well, telling CNN it is a 'result of fantasy'.

'The Florence Appel Court has written a script for a movie or a thriller book while it should have only ocnsidered facts and evidence,' now retired Judge Claudiio Hellmann wrote.

Knox says Hellman's statement give her hope that the High Court will again throw out the case, freeing her and Sollecito.

But if the High Court confirms the case, which Hellmann believes is likely, Italy could be called back to prison.

Experts
 believe the U.S. wouldn't extradict Knox back to Italy, allowing her to
 say in the U.S., but she calls that kind of existance 'not liveable'.

Ex-boyfriend Sollecito is in Italy and won't be able to escape the court's sentence.

Knox
 says she considers herself lucky though, that people have continued to 
support her and take an interest in her case - that she hasn't been 
forgotten.

For now, she's 
taking the case step by step and trying not to think of what might 
happen in the end. She's holding hope that the case is overturned and 
she can move on with her life which has been 'weighed down' by the 
'tremedous mess'.
