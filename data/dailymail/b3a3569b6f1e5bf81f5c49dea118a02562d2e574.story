A male GP has been found guilty of professional misconduct after it was revealed he violated female patients, including 'nuzzling' a woman's breast while conducting a skin examination.

Dr Mohammed Naiyer, from the NSW North Coast, was found guilty by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal over inappropriate behaviour towards two female patients on separate occasions in 2011.

A 25-year-old patient, know as Patient A, was at the medical centre where Dr Naiyer worked so she could have a mole removed from her buttock, the Medical Observer reported.

Breach of trust: GP Dr Mohammed Naiyer violated female patients including 'nuzzling' a woman's breast while conducting a skin examination in a medical centre where he worked

Dr Naiyer waited for a nurse who was present during the removal procedure to leave before inviting Patient A into his office so he could inspect a mole on her right breast.

'When I looked down I recall seeing the white of [the respondent's] eyes and observed his mouth brushing or nuzzling my breast,' Patient A said.Â

Earlier in the same year, Patient A visited the centre with concerns she had contracted an STI.

While the patient previously expressed concern about the mole, in her statement to the tribunal, she said the doctor used a dermascope to look at the mole and at the same time she could also feel him moving his head in a circular motion over the top of her breast.

After he took blood samples from the patient, Dr Naiyer completed a physical examination including internal and external examinations of her vagina and anus.

Despite being compulsory by law, the GP did not record details of the examination and went on to deny it took place.

It was found by the tribunal that the examination did not need to be carried out and that Dr Naiyer knowingly provided false information to the Health Care Complaints Commission in his denial that the examination occurred.

A second 32-year-old woman known as Patient B also attended the tribunal to give evidence against the doctor.

Patient B said Dr Naiyer had asked her to save his mobile number and if 'next time we can do coffee or coffee at night?'

While giving expert evidence, skin cancer primary care physician Dr Peter Kean Mun Lye said in his 22 years experience using a dermascope he never needed any part of his face, including his mouth, to touch a patient.

NSW skin cancer practitioner and GP Dr Hein Carel Vandenbergh also testified against Dr Naiyer and said a direct vaginal examination in relation to an STI needed to take place with a swab or speculum.

A further hearing is due to take place on 28 May.
