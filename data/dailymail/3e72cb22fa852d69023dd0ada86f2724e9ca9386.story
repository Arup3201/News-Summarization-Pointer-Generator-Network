We may not have the funds to check in to these luxurious lodgings, but one can dream...

A recent study from New World Wealth has explored the top hotel choices for multi-millionaires - both in the UK and abroad.

Globally, Las Vegas takes top honours as the destination of choice for millionaires, with both The Bellagio and Caesars Palace appearing in the top three.

Where do the super-rich stay on holiday? The Bellagio in Las Vegas has 6,400 multi-millionaire visits per year

In second place, New York City's The Plaza Hotel racked up 3,700 millionaire visitors from 2013-2014

The Waldorf Astoria, in New York City, and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, also prove popular

And in fifth place, the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore saw 3,100 super-rich visitors check in

For the purposes of the study, multi-millionaires are defined as having net assets of at least US$10million, around £6million.

The study is based on data collected from 20,000 global multi-millionaires and tracks hotel stays between June 2013 and June 2014.

Interestingly, Las Vegas hotels dominate the list, reflecting Sin City's appeal as a short-stay holiday spot.

The Plaza's top ranking is also impressive, given that the hotel only has 280 rooms, meaning its at a disadvantage against larger hotels that can accommodate more people.

2. The Plaza, New York City

3. Caesars Palace, Las Vegas

4. The Waldorf Astoria, New York City

5. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore 

1. The Ritz, London

2. Mandarin Oriental, London

3. Claridge's, London

4. The Savoy, London

5. The Berkeley, London 

When it comes to the UK, however, it's The Ritz in London that reigns supreme - coming in at number seven globally and number one in the country with 2,600 millionaire visitors in the past year. 

The Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge and Claridge's in Mayfair also score highly, though Claridge's remains mostly popular among business travellers.

The Ritz and the Mandarin Oriental, however, are particularly favoured among visitors from the Middle East and Asia.

The convenient location of The Savoy makes it a popular pick for those looking to take in a show on the West End, while The Berkeley is popular among North American tourists.

It's perhaps unsurprising that the bulk of multi-millionaires visiting the UK head to London, but there are some super-rich visitors heading to places such as Edinburgh, Bath, Oxford, Cambridge and several small towns in South East England. 

London's swanky hotel, The Ritz, came in seventh globally and first in the UK, with 2,600 millionaire visitors

The hotel, located in Piccadilly, first opened its doors in 1906 and has been a London fixture ever since

With a great deal of suites available to book, many opt for the breathtaking Green Park and skyline views 

Stays begin at £780 per night for a Super Queen,  with The Prince of Wales Suite coming in at £10,200

Another popular elite London hotel is the five-star Mandarin Oriental, located in Knightsbridge

Claridge's also remains popular among the wealthy, with 1,900 super-rich guests passing through last year

The Ritz in London has long been a bastion of opulence in the capital, since it first opened its doors - at its iconic 150 Piccadilly address - in 1906.

The property offers seven stunning styles of suites, decorated in the lavish style of Louis XVI, with the signature Prince of Wales Suite priced at £10,200 per night. 

And, of course, for those staying in either the Prince of Wales or the Royal Suite, access to a 24-hour butler is included.

The hotel's three distinctive dining options are also not to be missed - especially Afternoon Tea at The Palm Court - and during the holidays, the chefs curate special seasonal offerings, like limited-edition Christmas puddings.
