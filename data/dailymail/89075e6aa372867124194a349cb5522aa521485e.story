Lewis Hamilton’s rear left wheel was shredding its tyre into a thousand pieces and his rivalry with Nico Rosberg into a million tiny atoms of hatred.

It was on the second lap of a bitter Belgian Grand Prix that the first cruel cut of the day was made: Rosberg was vying for the lead with Hamilton through Les Combes when his front wing punctured his team-mate. 

From first place, Hamilton limped back to the pits, rubber being thrown into the air as he went.

His race was effectively over, even though he limped on at the back of the field for most of the afternoon before retiring, breathing a sigh of relief as he was pushed into the garage.

Rosberg required a change of wing but was far less severely damaged, finishing second behind Daniel Ricciardo and extending his lead in the drivers’ standings to 29 points.

Watching the accident unfold, it seemed Rosberg was to blame. He was behind Hamilton and responsible for keeping himself out of the way. ‘Nico hit me. Nico hit me,’ said Hamilton, registering his disgust at Rosberg’s aggression.

But the stewards did not intervene. They put it down as a racing incident. That was the majority interpretation of most seasoned observers and former drivers here during and immediately after the race. It was the version Rosberg stuck to in his every public utterance, even in an evening tweet.

However, what had been seen as a clumsy bit of driving was given a more sinister edge by Hamilton’s recollection of the post-race meeting between him, Rosberg, and team bosses Paddy Lowe and Toto Wolff. Hamilton (inset) claimed — and impeccable sources close to Mercedes concurred — that Rosberg told him he acted deliberately.

‘He said he did it on purpose,’ said Hamilton. ‘He said he could have avoided it. He said he did it to prove a point. He said it was all my fault.’

Rosberg declined to comment on the accusation, maintaining in public that it was no more than a ‘racing incident’.

There seems no doubt that Rosberg is willing to play dirty to win the world championship. In his defence, he believes Hamilton is too. Rosberg might even argue his deviousness is a direct response to Hamilton’s previous disregard for the imperatives of teamwork.

Certainly, he was angry going into this weekend about Hamilton’s failure to follow a team instruction at the last race in Hungary. The four-week summer break hardly acted as balm. 

The Englishman, who refused to apologise for not giving way, alluded to this last night, saying: ‘It was interesting because we had a meeting on Thursday and Nico expressed how angry he was. I was thinking, “It’s been weeks you’ve been lingering with this”. He sat there and said how angry he was at Toto and Paddy.’

The animosity — the product of a suffocating internal fight for the title between two old karting buddies — has festered all season.

Each complained the other had fiddled with his engine settings earlier in the season before the mystery and moaning at Monaco, when Rosberg ran off the track during qualifying, something Hamilton believed was intended to hinder his final lap.

So yesterday’s incident was an accident waiting to happen. The headstrong Lewis, with his tendency to brood on perceived slights, versus the calculating Rosberg, with the ice-cold ruthlessness he learned from three years as Michael Schumacher’s team-mate and a lifetime as Keke Rosberg’s son, was a combustible mix.

With weak and inexperienced management, the likelihood of a self-destructive crash was greater.

As Hamilton said after the race: ‘It reminds me of when I was at school, the teachers will say something but they won’t do anything.’

Hardly a grand prix weekend goes by when Mercedes don’t leave the paddock promising to call a meeting and discuss how they go racing.

To quote John Watson, a five-time winner from 152 races during the sport’s dangerous days of the 1970s, the men running the team are ‘the three stooges’: Niki Lauda, the chairman, Wolff, the executive director, and Lowe, the technical boss.

Well, yes, Lauda is a legend. But should he be walking around working for German media group RTL after a race? Would Ron Dennis act as a BBC pundit?

Up and down: Rosberg leads the chasing pack during the first lap, but the German could only finish second

As for Wolff, he started his press conference by asking, albeit jovially: ‘What did Niki say? Just so we are aligned…’

It all feels a bit disjointed. Wolff was meant to be in charge of the commercial side of the operation yet he seems to have elided into being the de facto team principal.

Nevertheless, Lowe issues the most important instructions over the radio.

There is not a central figure — a Ross Brawn — who calls the shots. The result, demonstrably, is that neither driver respects the instructions he is given.

So Wolff tried again last night to reassert his authority, saying: ‘It’s unacceptable. It’s clear. Racing accidents can happen, racing accidents among team-mates shouldn’t happen, racing incidents between team-mates on lap two of a 44-lap race with the dominant car should be a no, no, no, no, no.’

He said the team would review their policy of not imposing team orders. OK, but rules only work if they are followed. Yesterday, they were not.

And the upshot of this fratricide? Ricciardo, driving supremely, is 64 points off Rosberg. Can the Australian, with three race wins already, creep to the title?

Just a thought.
