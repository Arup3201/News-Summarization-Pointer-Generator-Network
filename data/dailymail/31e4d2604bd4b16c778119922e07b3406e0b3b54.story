The serene setting has echoes of England’s remote base in South Africa, isolated in the red-dirt countryside of a state mined for precious metals and gemstones.

Yet behind the iron gates of the Uruguayan camp in Sete Lagoas, there has been great turmoil and upheaval and an inquest into Saturday’s humbling 3-1 defeat at the hands of Costa Rica.

‘We got really heated up after the game,’ said captain Diego Lugano and although the fury has since subsided it has been replaced by paranoia ahead of Thursday’s date with England.

Ready to go: Suarez sat out Uruguay's opener but believes he will be fit to play against England

High stakes: Uruguay defender Lugano described Thursday's game against England a 'life or death'.

Uruguay manager Oscar Tabarez is convinced someone had been spying on a behind-closed-doors training session on Sunday, and glimpsed his tactical plans for a game both teams must win to avoid an early flight out of Brazil.

There was heavy security and an aggressive door policy in operation at the JN Resort Hotel yesterday in defiance of the giant ‘Bem Vindo’ welcome sign above the door.

Tabarez and Lugano both spoke at a brief press conference, immediately after which all but selected Uruguayan media were marched not only out of the hotel but beyond the perimeter fence by security staff to find shade near the cattle.

Central to the intrigue has been the fitness of Luis Suarez who, during the supposed-to-be-secret training session, partnered Edinson Cavani in attack.

Suarez had knee surgery ahead of the World Cup and has been in a race against time ever since. Despite insisting he would be fit, he watched from the sidelines, in his kit, as an unused substitute against Costa Rica.

Officially, yesterday, there were few clues about whether he would return against England in Sao Paulo.

Paranoia: Oscar Tabarez, the Urugayan coach, thinks that there have been spies at their training sessions

‘It is a possibility,’ said Tabarez. ‘That is our dream,’ said Lugano. As for Suarez, he spoke later and reiterated his belief that he is ready for action.

‘I did not miss any days of my recovery,’ said Suarez. ‘At no time did I think I would miss the World Cup. If I play, it is because I am 100 per cent.’

He also flashed a warning to England, who started with five Liverpool players in the team that lost 2-1 against Italy on Saturday. ‘I know all the players in the England team, either as team-mates or opponents,’ said Suarez.

‘They have defensive deficiencies that I can take advantage of, but I will not say how. We have to move forward with strong character. Trust us.’ 

Those words seem to confirm what the Uruguayan press are convinced of; that he will start on Thursday, one of three changes to the team beaten in the Group D opener.

Southampton’s Gaston Ramirez is also expected to come in and experienced Porto defender Jorge Fucile will replace Alvaro Pereira who was sent off against Costa Rica.

‘We are going to change everything,’ said Tabarez. ‘We need to win. So do England. We need to change attitude and put different measures in place.’

The Costa Rica defeat did not go down well back home, seen as proof by many that this team is in its death throes after a glorious ride to World Cup semi-finals in 2010 and the Copa America title in 2011.

The bulk of the squad is the same, but the feeling is they have grown old and slow together, laboured through qualification, stumbling into the World Cup via a play-off against Jordan and that Tabarez, a legend at the helm for eight years, cannot go any further.

Uruguay’s aim, of course, is to disprove this theory but first they must beat England. ‘It is our greatest challenge,’ said Lugano.

‘It is life or death. England are the favourites but we have the strength for the battle.

Fit again: Suarez returned to Uruguay training and is confident that he can play against England on Thursday

Up and coming: ¿They have young, quick players with great potential,' Tabarez said of England

‘Against Costa Rica we were bad. Everyone was annoyed. The details were wrong and we were unable to change, but now we are united again.’

England supporters will fear the return of Suarez but Tabarez spoke of concern about the pace and variety at Roy Hodgson’s disposal.

‘England deserved better luck against Italy,’ said the 67-year-old former teacher. ‘They have young, quick players with great potential, but someone like Steven Gerrard is someone we cannot neglect.’

And with this compliment, the hospitality abruptly ended. Tabarez was gone and the bouncers moved in to chase all but the chosen few from the premises, out into the sun-baked hills of Minas Gerais.
