Mail on Sunday columnist Stuart Broad returns to give us his views from a week of cricket. He discusses the 'run-out' of Jos Buttler at Edgbaston and comparing it to not walking, why there is no logic behind it, how exciting it is to have three debutants, his own fitness, and how their Ashes humiliation is being put behind them.

I think anyone trying to compare the ‘Mankad’ run-out of Jos Buttler at Edgbaston this week with not walking is very naive.

Some people have tried, no doubt with what happened with myself in the Ashes at Trent Bridge last summer in mind. But there’s no comparison.

I’ve never played a game at any level, including schools cricket, where I’ve seen a batsman run outat the non-striker’s end.

That’s why I think it is completely wrong and anyone who compares it to not walking is being naive.

Don't compare the run-out of Jos Buttler (left) at the ODI match between England and Sri Lanka to not walking.

Why?

Because I’ve only ever played with one consistent walker and that was Graeme Swann. Not walking is the norm — you wait for the umpire’s decision. That’s fair.

There’s a vast difference with ‘Mankading’. It’s not the norm. I was actually surprised Angelo Matthews, as Sri Lanka’s captain, upheld the appeal.

But I think the major problem is it shouldn’t even be in the players’ hands. This goes above pointing at players or captains.

Leave it up to the umpires. It shouldn’t be an option to have a dismissal like that because at the end of the day if you’re a supporter you’ve not seen a ball bowled, you’ve not seen a shot played but you’ve lost a world-class batsman.

I can’t see any logic behind that being a mode of dismissal.

It seems a really strange rule that someone can be run out like that because you’re getting no entertainment from it as a fan.

I wasn’t in the one-day squad so I actually watched the incident in the Notts changing room during ourgame at Hove and everyone was pretty surprised.

The one consistent walker I ever played with was Graeme Swann. Not walking is the norm. You wait.

As I said earlier, I think it should be in the umpires’ hands. Sri Lanka said Jos was stealing runs at Lord’s and he had a warning at Edgbaston, so the decision shouldn’t be up to the player to take the stumps, that should be the umpire saying: ‘Look, we’ve gone upstairs, you’re stealing a few toomany yards, if you do it again we’ll take five off your score or we’ll take 10 off your score.’ That would stop people doing it.

We are all excited about starting the Test series this week. Regardless of what happened at Edgbaston, we won’t need any extra motivation as we’re kicking off a new era in the first Test of the summer at Lord’s.

We’re going to have three debutants who will be buzzing and Lord’s Tests always bring out a huge amount of excitement.

So I can’t imagine it will add any extra spice because I expect there to be plenty of spice anyway. You’ve got the honour and pride of playing for your country at Lord’s.

We have a lot to prove after what happened over the winter. And with the new players coming into a much-changed side, we know we have to gel quickly.

Fans might not know some of the new guys and I’ve only met Sam Robson for about 30 seconds in my life, so it will be very important we get to know our team-mates as well and as quickly as possible.

Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan have shown they have got what it takes in international white-ball cricket and Sam’s county pedigree proves he is a fantastic cricketer, too.

They just have to believe what they have done to get selected in the first place means they belong at this level.

My knee is doing fine, thank you...

It’s great to be back in an England squad after missing the start of the summer with patella tendinitis.

It flared up on harder surfaces in the winter but the knee was fine down at Hove last week so I’m very confident it will not be a problem for the rest of the summer. It was always planned, even before the Ashes, that I would probably not play in the one-day series against Sri Lanka.

I could have played but we decided I would miss it. The physio Jon Alty, who is in his first year at Trent Bridge, has always been at the end of a phone and has been exceptional.

When I’m playing I have two physio sessions a week that will help strengthen the leg and it takespressure off the knee. I’m having ice and compression after bowling, a lot of heat before bowling and massage through the quads to take the pressure off the knee. It is actually landing on my knee that brings inflammation so I’m going to be wearing a knee pad to make the impact of falling on a small square slightly less.

It might not do the job, it’s just to try to take off some of the impact. I suppose it’s a bit like what youuse in gardening, the knee pads an old bloke might use doing the flowerbeds.

I just put it on and bowl in it, it took a little bit of getting used to but it helps diving in the field because fielding is an important part of international cricket so you can't hide.

The knee was fine at Hove last week, thankfully. Two physio sessions a week help strengthen the leg.

...and we're leaving the Ashes defeat in the past - exactly where it belongs

A lot has been said about last winter, especially what happened in Australia.

But the message we have got from Peter Moores since he came in as coach is ‘what’s done is done, it’s in the past. We don’t want to look back’.

You obviously have to learn from what happened but we don’t want to talk about the winter because it’s about pushing this team forward now.

I think having three debutants this week is a big statement because that’s evidence we’re looking to the future now. It is going to be crucial the senior players and management involved in that Ashes series don’t keep talking about it, because we’ve got a big job to do this summer.
