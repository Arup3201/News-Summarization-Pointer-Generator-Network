During an interview with Barclays Premier League World to be shown this week, Ross Barkley announces that his best position is striker.

'I can have my greatest impact there,' he claims. 'I'm free to roam around, take players on, have shots and create chances.'

This season, the year when people were convinced Barkley would come of age in the colours of Everton, he has scored twice and created just two more. Little wonder he accepts he has had a dip in form.

The problem with Barkley, who showed flashes of his talent after coming on as a 55th-minute substitute during England's 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin, is that nobody is quite sure what his best position is.

Ask everybody involved with him at Everton or with England and they will come up with a different answer.

This season alone he has played in five different roles (six if his appearances as a substitute are included) for Everton: 10 in his favoured role off the main forward, six starts on the left, once in front of the back four, once in the centre of midfield and one start at right wing.

At 21 there has to be an element of confusion, struggling to work out why his manager Roberto Martinez is playing him in so many different positions at Goodison Park.

For some players this would be an education, an opportunity to experience the game from different areas of the pitch as they continue their development. With Barkley, it feels very different.

He has had such a billing since he first broke in to the Everton them, with comparisons to the late, great Alan Ball, to the mercurial talents of Paul Gascoigne over recent times, that his name creates mild hysteria whenever it is mentioned.

It seems particularly unfair to compare him with Ball, a man who controlled the tempo of matches when he was playing for Everton, Arsenal and England. He was also, notably, a World Cup winner.

It should also be remembered that Gascoigne, who had a far better goalscoring record at Newcastle, had to wait until he was 21 to make his England debut, against Denmark in 1988.

Barkley has serious potential, something Roy Hodgson and his coaching staff recognise with his regular appearances in the England squad.

They, too, are baffled by Barkley's failure to hold down a regular, fixed position with his club because he is attentive and willing to learn during England's training sessions.

2012-13 Appearances 0 Goals 0

Sheff Wed (loan) Appearances 13 Goals 4

Leeds (loan) Appearances 4 Goals 0

2013-14 Appearances 38 Goals 7

2014-15 Appearances 28 Goals 2 

Barkley made his England debut in 2013 - he has 12 caps and no goals. 

There is a theory that Barkley, who began his career as central defender, would be better making those surging runs from deeper position. The problem is convincing Barkley to commit to the idea.

In Miami last summer, after England had drawn a tune-up game 2-2 with Ecuador, he was encouraged by Hodgson to keep the ball, to be more intuitive and use it more wisely.

There is a similar issue with Everton's central defender John Stones: he has outstanding attributes, but he is caught in possession, in dangerous areas of the pitch, too often.

This is an area England's coaching staff have addressed with Barkley, showing him the hotspots when a careless ball or misplaced pass at the highest level can end in the back of Joe Hart's net.

Against Scotland last November, when Hodgson placed enormous pressure on himself to secure a result at Celtic Park against an old rival, he was caught screaming expletives at Barkley after he came on as a substitute.

There is certainly an element of frustration building up around this young player because has yet to convert his obvious talent into the complete, all round, match-winning performance.

There is certainly a demand for more goals, something he aspired to with those two shots that hit the woodwork during Everton's damaging 5-2 defeat by Dynamo Kiev in the Europa League.

Last summer, when Barkley was in Miami preparing for the World Cup with England, Martinez told Sportsmail that his young midfielder needed room to breathe.

'We have to allow him to develop and let's not put too much pressure on him. At the moment he is perfectly suited to playing in the No 10 role, but in time he will develop into the complete midfielder.'

At the moment he is a substitute for England, watching the games from the bench and listening to the advice of captain Wayne Rooney after the game with Lithuania on Friday.

Rooney has taken a pastoral role in Barkley's welfare, offering him advice when he was named among England's substitutes for the 4-0 victory over Lithuania at Wembley last Friday.

Barkley accepts that his form has dipped, well aware that he has yet to mature in to a role that suits club and country.

When he settles on a preferred position, Barkley will be the biggest beneficiary.
