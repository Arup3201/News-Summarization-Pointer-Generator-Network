Burnley completed their pre-season preparations with a convincing 3-1 victory against Italian top-flight side Hellas Verona.

Verona went in front when Greece international Lazaros Christodoulopoulos scored with the first attack of the second half after a goalless first period.

Burnley struck back immediately however, through new signing Matthew Taylor and then went in front 15 minutes later thanks to Lukas Jutkiewicz's header, his sixth pre-season goal since joining from Middlesbrough over the summer. Winger Ross Wallace made it 3-1 with a superb free kick towards the end, rounding off a very encouraging second half display from Burnley.

Clarets boss Sean Dyche will be delighted with this result which builds on a midweek 2-2 draw with La Liga outfit Celta Vigo.

The home faithful can now look forward to a visit from Jose Mourinho's Chelsea to kick off their return to the Premier League.

Above the rest: Jutkiewicz heads home to bag Burnley's second goal of the game
