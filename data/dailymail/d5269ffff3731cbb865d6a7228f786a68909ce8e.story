A Nashville bar owner who shot dead a popular country music singer and claimed self defense has been released on bail after being charged with murder.

The lawyer for Chris Ferrell, 45, says a private investigator he hired has discovered a bullet lodged in the wall of the Pit and Barrel that police missed.

That bullet could help prove that Farrell had no choice but to open fire and killed 44-year-old Wayne Mills, a veteran performer who had Blake Shelton, Jamey Johnson and American Idol winner Taylor Hicks open for him before they became stars.Â

Ferrell testified that he had received a dozen death threats since the killing - but insisted he acted in self defense

The Tennessean reports that Farrell's lawyer revealed at a bond hearing that he has received more than a dozen death threats and felt compelled to wear a bulletproof vest to his attorney's office since killing Mills, who was married with a young son.

However, Farrell claims that Mills tried to kill and rob him in the wee hours of November 23 when he and friends went to the Pit and Barrel after a night of drinking November 23.

The two men were previously friends, according to family members.

The next night, SPIKE TV was set to feature the bar on 
its show Bar Rescue, which brings in a professional restaurant 
consultant to give struggling pubs a make-over. The network canceled the new episode and aired a re-run instead.

Farrell
 hired a top criminal defense lawyer, who contracted the services of a 
retired Nashville homicide detective to conduct an independent 
investigation of the shooting.

The Pit and Barrel bar, where Mills was killed, had recently been featured on an episode of the SPIKE TV reality show 'Bar Rescue'

On Monday, he was released after posting $150,000 bail.

Mills, a native of Arab, Alabama, toured with the Wayne Mills Band, which played college towns for more than 15 years.

Mills, who was married with a young 
son, graduated from the University of Alabama with an education degree, 
and also played football for the school, according to the band's 
website.

Mr Scott said he was shocked to hear the bar owner's claims that Mills had become dangerous.

Condolences poured into his Facebook page - including from Shelton.

'Extremely sad to hear about the death of my old friend Wayne Mills... Rest in peace brother,' he tweeted.

Mills, who toured college towns for years, was a fixture in the Nashville country music scene. He was married with a young son
