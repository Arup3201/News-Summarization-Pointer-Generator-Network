There is trust in a relationship and then, on a whole other level, there is what daredevil stunt couple Bhramharamba and Balashankar Budati share.

The Budatis, from Chirala Mandal in India, perform incredible - or insane depending on your perspective - feats with sticks, stones and sharp objects for the amusement of others.

And usually they involve Bhramharamba in the firing line, as in this video where Balashankar balances a coconut on his wife's throat before he demolishes it with a giant machete.

The Budati stunt couple from Chirala Mandal in India perform a range of daredevil feats

Their coconut trick features on World's Most Talented, which will air on Watch from March 31

The pair will feature in the opening episode of World's Most Talented, which pits countries against each other to decide who has the most impressive skills, airing Tuesday at 9pm from March 31.

The show, narrated by Jonathan Ross, traverses the world with eight performances from each of the two nation's featured that week. 

India meets Romania in the opening programme, with the Budati's representing their homeland against a nation led by a uni-cyclist who precariously balances on the edge of dam.

He nails the centre of the coconut and as it smashes its water splashes all over his brave wife

Speed, strength, memory and sheer acts of bravery all have their place in the program, while the acts themselves are filmed by roving presenters Laura Jackson and David Brain.

Their raw footage is show to 100 vloggers around the world who will decide which country is the World's Most Talented.
