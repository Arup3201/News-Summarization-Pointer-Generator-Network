It was not a good morning for veteran journalist Lester Holt.

The 53-year-old overslept, saying that his alarm clock did not go off, and he barely made it to the Today Show studios in New York on Saturday in time for his hosting duties at the weekend morning program.

His Weekend Today co-host, Jenna Wolfe, feared she would be left in a lurch but Holt managed to make it to NBC just 40 minutes before the show went live.

You didn't set that: Weekend Today co-host Jenna Wolfe jokes with Lester Holt, who overslept on Saturday

Could we drop it? Lester Holt takes a beating on air from his co-host for barely making the show

Holt took to Twitter to alert viewers of his frazzled morning.

'For the first time in 9 yrs of hosting weekend @todayshow I overslept!' he posted on his Twitter account. 

After his Twitter message, one person responded, 'I would think at a big-time network someone would call you!'

Well, that's exactly what happened.

The executive producer for the show ended up giving Holt a wake-up call at 5:45 a.m and he made a mad dash from his apartment, in the Flatiron District in New York City, to 30 Rock in midtown Manhattan where the show goes live at 7:00 a.m.

Are you coming? Jenna Wolfe wondered if she would be eastwooding, if Holt didn't make it in time

Given Holt's reputation as a consummate 
professional in the news community, his colleague couldn't help but joke about his behavior since it was so out of character.

'Am I #eastwooding this morning??' his co-host Wolfe, 38, tweeted about his absence in the lead-up to the show, posting a 
video of her sitting next to an empty chair. 

'So guess who overslept this morning?' she said in the video.

'The hardest working man on television decided that he needed some beauty sleep. Yeah, he's still coming in, running a little late.'

Wolfe was referencing the latest 
internet craze inspired by a set-up arranged by actor Clint 
Eastwood during his speech at the Republican National Convention, when 
he spoke to an empty chair in a pretend conversation with President Barack Obama.

And when Holt finally arrived at the studio, Wolfe couldn't help but make fun of his late start.

'My alarm didn't go off for the record,' he informed her, in a video caught by a member of the crew and posted online.

'Yeah I've heard that 'my alarm not going off' many times,' she said in response.

But Holt insisted, 'I set it for 4:15 but it didn't go off.'

'Did your dog also eat your homework?' she joked, unwilling to cut him any slack.

Uggh: Lester Holt looked less than pleased when he overslept and missed his train stop on a trip in England during the Olympics

And the hits just kept on comin' for Holt.

Once Wolfe and Holt were in position and the show went live from Studio 1A, Wolfe wanted to make sure that viewers were also informed of Holt's morning mishap.

'You never do anything wrong so I have to bask in it a little,' she joked.

Despite his condensed time to prep for the program, he managed to pull it all off beautifully.

Indeed, Holt is coming off a busy summer - having helped the NBC News team in their coverage of the London 2012 Olympic Games.

And sleep proved to be scarce for him during his stint across the pond.

He was enjoying a nap on a train ride from London to Alnmouth, in the north of England, when he overslept, missed his stop and ended up in Scotland on August 7.

He had to change trains four times over a time span of 9 hours to get back where he needed to be. 

But in his typical good humor, the newsman joked about the incident and shared it with his fans over Twitter.

'If ya gotta end up in the wrong place u can do worse than Edinburgh. Catching some quick sights,' he tweeted, adding that on his return trip he would be 'drinking LOTS of coffee.'

Holt has a packed schedule on the 
weekend.

He is the full-time co-anchor of Weekend
Today, anchor of the weekend edition of NBC Nightly News and is the 
current host for NBC's newsmagazine, Dateline.

The California native joined MSNBC in 2000 and started with NBC News in 2005.
