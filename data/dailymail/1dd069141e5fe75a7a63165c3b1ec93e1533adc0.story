Six people are either dead or missing following Typhoon Phanfone, which whipped up 112 mile-per hour winds and dumped several inches of rain when it came ashore in Tokyo, Japan early Monday morning. 

A U.S. airman stationed on Okinawa is one of the confirmed dead, after being swept out to sea Sunday afternoon while taking pictures of the large waves on the north side of the island. Three other American servicemen were swept away with him. One survived, while two others are still missing. Their names are being withheld for 24 hours, while the military contacts their families. 

A 21-year-old surfer is one of the others missing in the Pacific, off the coast of southwest Tokyo, while rescuers are searching the scene of two landslides in Yokohama for two people that went missing there. Overall, about 23 people were injured across the nation, public broadcaster NHK announced.

The eye of the storm: One American airman stationed on Okinawa has drowned due to the typhoon, and two other U.S. servicemen are missing. Around 23 people were injured in the typhoon across Japan 

The powerful typhoon came ashore in Tokyo around 11am on Monday, and moved northeast before eventually blowing out to sea over the Pacific.

About 1.7million people were advised to take refuge in the storm, with 50,000 ordered to evacuate in the central Japanese prefecture of Shizuoka where landslides and floods were most at risk.

Another 5,000 were evacuated in Aichi, where a local river threatened to burst its banks.  An estimated 9,000 homes in seven prefectures lost power in the typhoon.

The strong winds and heavy rainfall caused travel chaos across the nation as an estimated 600 flights were grounded and dozens of bullet train services cancelled. 

These disturbances caused an even more hectic rush hour, as hundreds of thousands of workers battled the downpour to make it to their offices in Tokyo this morning.

But some had the day off, thanks to the damage the typhoon caused big businesses like the auto industry. 

Toyota Motors suspended work at 12 of its factories in Aichi, central Japan, on Monday after the typhoon battered its buildings.   

'But we plan to resume operation at around 4pm as there was no damage to the facilities,' a company spokeswoman said.

The typhoon also led Japanese officials to suspend the search for about 12 hikers still missing on Mount Ontake, which suddenly erupted on September 27.

'We want to resume operations as soon as possible when weather permits,' said an official of the crisis management office of Nagano. 

Officials were also monitoring the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which went into meltdown following the 2011 tsunami. 

Tokyo Electric Power Co officials said they were halting ground and sea operations in preparation for the weather.

'We are also patrolling and checking where water may flow in,' a company spokesman said.
