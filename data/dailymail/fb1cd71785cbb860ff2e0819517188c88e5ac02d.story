The Hidden exhibition was developed in 2009 to demonstrate to the community that there is more to Rookwood than just funerals and memorials.

Robyn Hawes, president of the Friends of Rookwood, told Daily Mail Australia: 'We had an open day for the exhibition on Sunday and that was good. 

'We had lots of people come along to have a look and we had the old Rookwood style buses which were doing tours.
