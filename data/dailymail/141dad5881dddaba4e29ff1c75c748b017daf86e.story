A father-of-three was murdered at a diner after stepping in to defend his girlfriend against an unwanted suitor, it has been alleged.

Jason Lewis, 34, was shot in the chest at close range by a fellow guest celebrating his birthday at a Brooklyn eatery around 5am Sunday morning.

Mr Lewis was with his girlfriend at the Country House Diner in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, when an apparently drunk Tyrone Gainer, 27, ‘grabbed’ the woman and Mr Lewis intervened, witnesses claimed.

Victim: Jason Lewis, 34, was a father of three who was shot and killed at his local diner after he defended his girlfriend against a drunken suitor

After a verbal exchange between the trio, Mr Gainer, who was celebrating his birthday, allegedly slapped Jason Lewis in the face.

‘Why did you smack me? We don’t have to shed blood for this,’ was Mr Lewis’ alleged reply, to which Mr Gainer took out a .22-caliber handgun and shot him in the chest in front of shocked guests and staff.

‘He just put the gun to his heart and pulled the trigger,’ owner Hakim Abdel told New York Daily News. ‘Two seconds – it just took two seconds.’

The incident was caught on CCTV where Mr Gainer can be seen arriving from celebrating his birthday in a strip club, and approaching Mr Lewis' girlfriend, a 911 dispatcher.

The tape shows Mr Gainer 'sneaking his handgun around an onlooker and into the gut of Mr Lewis,' the New York Post reported..

Witnesses reported Mr Lewis and his girlfriend walked outside the diner where he collapsed in her arms.

Mr Lewis, who lived in the area, was taken to Brooklyn Hospital Center but his life could not be saved.

A friend said that Mr Lewis, who ran a private bus service company, was a family man unlikely to cause trouble who would pick up his three children, two sons aged six and ten and a 14-year-old girl, from school every day.

‘I’ve known him for 20 years,’ Mr Abdel said. ‘He’s very quiet, one of the best people you’ll ever meet in life, one of the most humble.’

Mr Gainer was arrested at the scene and is currently in custody charged with murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal use of a firearm.

It was reported that he has previous arrests for threatening a police officer and tampering with evidence.
