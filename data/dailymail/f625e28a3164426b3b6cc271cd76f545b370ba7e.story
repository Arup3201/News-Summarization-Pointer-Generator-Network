Full time: Chris Jarvis said he was expected to work from 9.30am-6pm

When you sign up to do a spot of work shadowing to 'gain an insight into the business', you don't expect to be working for nine hours a day doing the work of a full-time - and fully-paid - employee.

So Chris Jarvis took legal action against entertainment and electronics giant Sony when it refused to pay him for four months' work.

And the company has paid the its 'unpaid intern' £4,600 after the video games design graduate took his case to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).

Mr Jarvis, a video games design graduate from Milton Keynes, signed up to do an internship at Sony Computer Entertainment in Cambridge last September.

He signed up for the role of '3D Environment Artist intern'  and expected that he would be shadowing a Sony designer to learn about the company.

But he found himself in the office from 9.30am to 6pm every day, testing 3D artwork for games.

'I was basically clicking buttons to make sure the pictures that had come in from China were working,' Mr Jarvis said. 'It's normally part of the Environment Artist's job - but it's time-consuming and boring work.

The 25-year-old, who has a first class degree in Games Art and Design from Norwich University, 'politely informed' the 
company that they owed him at least minimum wage of £6.19, considering 
he was effectively working as a full-time employee.

'They were very dismissive and told me I was a volunteer and that's how I could work for free,' he said.

Mr Jarvis said he was also making a daily round-trip commute of three-and-a-half hours to Sony's City 
House base in Cambridge, a journey which the company agreed to cover in travel expenses.

But he said that after the first month's payment, the travel expenses dried up.

'I was at the end of my overdraft and I didn't know what to do' said Mr Jarvis, who is now a lead graphic designer at Air Raid Clothing in Milton Keynes.

'So I looked into my rights and found that I was legally doing the work of an employee.'

The case went to a tribunal, and the 
$20billion company coughed up weeks before it was due to be heard.

Sony ended up paying Mr Jarvis around £1,000 more than he originally asked for.

The company also asked him to sign an agreement to keep quiet about the deal, which Mr Jarvis declined.

Jasmine Patel of solicitors Leigh Day, who dealt with Mr Jarvis's case, said: 'In Chris’s case, it was very clear. We 
looked at the fact that he had set hours, that he was expected to do the
 work he was given and that he was required to do that work personally.

She added that employees needed to have a better understanding of workers' rights.

'The only people who will be able to afford to do these internships are the ones who can pay to do them, while the people from poorer backgrounds can’t,' she said.

'On a legal level, under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, interns who meet the definition of a “worker” are entitled to be paid at least the national minimum wage.

'A key question when determining whether someone is a worker is whether the intern is obliged to perform work or services for the company and whether the organisation is obliged to provide it – i.e. a mutually of obligations.

'If the intern is doing work which is of value to the company this may also be a good indication that the intern is actually a worker and should be paid.

'These cases are very case specific 
but where there is a mutuality of obligations, someone is really 
providing value to the company and the internship is for quite a long 
period - say six months - there will probably be a higher chance that 
they will be a worker and therefore should be being paid. 

'You could argue that someone who 
comes in every single day and makes the tea should eventually be paid 
for that service if they’re proving to be of value for the company, but 
these cases will in the end be decided on a case by case basis.'

According to Government regulations, 
employers do not have to pay the minimum wage if an internship only 
involves observing an employee and no work is carried out by the intern.

Charities, voluntary organisations associated bodies and statutory bodies do not have to pay volunteers, but other businesses are not allowed to refuse to pay a worker by claiming they are a volunteer.

About 100,000 young people are thought 
to be working for no pay and 100 companies are being investigated by 
HMRC for allegedly breaching minimum wage laws.

Sony declined to comment.
