We are having the wrong debate! All the talk is about Alastair Cook and the England captaincy when what we should be urgently discussing is the England coaching job.

The role and responsibility of Peter Moores needs to be massively increased while the role and identity of the England cricket captain is a lesser issue.

English cricket traditionally lionises the captain and makes him central to everything — WG Grace, Jardine, Hutton, May, Illingworth, Brearley, Gower, Atherton, Hussain, Vaughan, Strauss, Cook.

The fabled role of the captaincy is a cornerstone of cricketing tradition but just recently the landscape has changed radically and has created overwhelming pitfalls for the captain. He should not be the totemic figure any more, that must be the head coach.

The media scrutiny is infinitely bigger than ever before and that is a problem.

I can’t imagine what it must be like to have every ball and every single decision you make in the course of five days, across a five-Test series minutely scrutinised by Michael Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Ian Botham, Shane Warne, Andrew Strauss, Michael Holding, David Gower, David Lloyd, Bob Willis, Michael Vaughan, Graeme Swann and Geoffrey Boycott to list just the first dozen Sky and BBC TMS pundits that come to mind. And that’s before you take into account the minute-by-minute blogging and tweeting.

The majority of those concerned were captains, some more successful than others, and will argue they had to cope with similar pressures. But they did not, not to this extent. This is way off the scale.

An England cricket captain can now find himself pinned up against the wall for five days — there is no escape, and no right of reply. You can’t get involved in arguments with media pundits mid-Test.

The result for the England captain can almost be paralysis by analysis when things aren’t going well. It’s an unprecedented, unrelenting, barrage of expert opinion. How can one man out in the middle, under the cosh, compete against that brains trust? How can it not affect him and wear him down?

The biggest problem of all, however, is how the England captain still seems to be central to everything when the man in charge must be the coach. The captain should have no role in the composition of a team or squad.

Such a system can only be compromised by his relationship with other players. Nor should there be selectors either, that system is archaic. Selection must be totally down to the coach.

Why on earth did Cook become involved in the Kevin Pietersen sacking and exile? It should have nothing to do with him.

When I was the England rugby coach I would consult trusted lieutenants such as Andy Robinson and Phil Larder but I alone always picked the team and squads. The captain wasn’t consulted although I did sit down with my captains AFTER I had made my decision but before the side was announced.

I would explain my thinking and we would have a good ‘grown-up’ discussion about the team.

I would never risk Martin Johnson’s performance by opening him up to the complications which arise  in the selection process.

The England cricket coach must start taking total ownership of the team. In a five-day Test he will, almost by definition, spend 50 per cent of that time in the England dressing room talking to the players.

He has great potential to influence tactics in every conceivable way — batting orders, bowling rotations, field settings — and generally lift the mood or dampen euphoria if huge. It is his team, yet the captain takes all the heat.

I’m looking for Peter Moores to step up. He is in charge and when the going gets rough the pressure should come on the coach, not the captain.

During the actual course of a Test the first port of call for all the main media interviews every day must be the coach.

Whenever Chelsea play the first voice is always Jose Mourinho. He is not out there on the pitch but he is definitely in charge and is happy to be held to account.

The ECB should downgrade the captaincy. There is so much information now available, how can he process all that and still perform with the bat?

It’s not quite like football where there is that mentality that you could throw the armband to almost anybody. The role of England cricket captain will always carry greater weight, but it doesn’t need to be so central to a team’s ability to perform. It’s more a hand on the tiller.

Many will read this and say ‘it is what it is’, and look at other Test captains and Test teams who are doing just fine. Indeed, MS Dhoni, India’s captain is a prime example. Having watched cricket first hand in India I can tell you he is under huge pressure from fans at home and I greatly admire how he leads his team.

But that’s no argument for continuing in the same way, in fact it’s the opposite. In Cook we have an outstanding cricketer who I believe can be a great leader.

We should be asking why this is happening, and then move heaven and earth to remedy the situation; not simply to dismiss one of our great players and pass the baton on to another who will inevitably become worn down by the same pitfalls.

Moores should be taking far more of the media burden off Alastair Cook
