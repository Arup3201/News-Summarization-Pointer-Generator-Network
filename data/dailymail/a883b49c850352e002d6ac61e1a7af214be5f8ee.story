Dismissed: PC Jordan Powell, who was jailed for 15 months for having sex with a domestic violence victim while on duty, has been sacked by his force

A married policeman who had sex with a domestic violence victim while on duty has been sacked by his force.

Jordan Powell, 31, was jailed at Gloucester Crown Court last month after admitting three counts of misconduct.

The court heard Powell, a married father of two, was arrested in July last year after sending text messages to three women asking for sex.

West Mercia Police said PC Powell had now been dismissed without notice at a special case hearing chaired by chief constable David Shaw.

The force’s deputy chief constable, Simon Chesterman, said in a statement issued after the hearing: 'The outcome of this case highlights the serious nature of the deliberate, calculated and predatory conduct involved and should act as a reminder to all officers and staff of the importance of maintaining professional boundaries at work.

'The vast majority of our officers and staff are honest, hard-working individuals who are dedicated to serving our local communities.

'Incidents of this nature have the potential to seriously damage the trust placed in us by those communities.'

Powell, from Tipton, West Midlands, was jailed for 15 months after pleading guilty to three charges of misconduct in a public office committed between May and July 2012.

Gloucester Crown Court had heard that father-of-two Powell had a 'large sexual appetite', which led him to repeatedly cheat on his wife.

The day before Powell was arrested in July last year he sent - as he arrived at work - text messages simultaneously to three women asking for sex.

Powell was caught when his own force became suspicious and set a trap using an undercover female officer.

The officer, known only as Roxy, pretended to be a victim of domestic violence and rang police in June last year for assistance.

Powell was dispatched to her home - fitted with covert recording equipment - to investigate her complaint.

Within a couple of hours of leaving Roxy’s home in Kidderminster, Powell had sent her flirtatious text messages from his personal mobile phone, the court heard.

Powell sent text messages containing kisses and flirtatious comments, asking whether Roxy had a 'smile on that pretty face'.

The conversation then became more sexual, prosecutor Sarah Regan said.

The PC joined West Mercia Police in October 2004 and received a written warning in 2008 for having an inappropriate relationship with a female victim of crime.
