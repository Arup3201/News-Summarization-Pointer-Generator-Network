A Polish woman who was disfigured by a huge facial tumour has revealed her new face at a press conference.

The 26-year-old, identified only as Joanna, underwent Poland's second ever facial transplant after neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition causing benign tumours - left her unable to chew, talk or swallow.

During a press conference yesterday, Joanna thanked doctors and the family of the person who donated their face, and told journalists: 'I have nice eyebrows now'.

Transformed: The 26-year-old, identified only as Joanna, underwent Poland's second ever facial transplant after neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition causing benign tumours - left her unable to chew, talk or swallow

Grateful: During a press conference yesterday, Joanna thanked doctors and the family of the person who donated their face, and told journalists: 'I have nice eyebrows now'

Difficult: Before the operation, Joanna struggled to chew, swallow or speak. Following the surgery she can now do all these things again

New life: Joanna has reportedly told doctors that she hopes to return to education, possibly studying psychology 'as she would like to help others'

Speaking at the conference, Dr Adam Maciejewski, who performed both Joanna's surgery as well as the only other facial transplant in Poland, said: 'Joanna feels very good. She's getting better.'

He added that, once she has gets through the long-term rehabilitation programme she's still facing, Joanna hopes to return to education, possibly studying psychology 'as she would like to help others'

Earlier Dr Maciejewski, who led the 23-hour surgery last week, said he hopes the transplant of 80 per cent of the skin on her face will give her the ability to chew, talk or swallow.

Joanna was severely deformed by neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along the nerves.

The condition can also cause bone problems, pressure on the spinal nerves, severe pain, learning disabilities and vision and hearing problems. There is no cure for it.

Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born.

Joanna had 23-hours of surgery to give her a new face. During the operation, 80 per cent of the skin on her face was replaced

Despite their alarming appearance, the 
growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of 
cells - are not cancerous or contagious.

The facial tumour will not recur because the skin on her new face is from different genes, genetics expert Dr Anand Saggar told MailOnline. 

In May, Dr Maciejewski and his 
colleagues performed Poland's first face transplant on a man whose face 
was torn off by a stone mason's machine. His recovery is said to be 
progressing.

The man's operation took 27 hours and was carried out just weeks after his accident.

It was thought to be the first face transplant to be carried out so soon after the damage had occurred - previous transplants have taken months, or even years, to prepare.

Joanna is currently in serious but stable condition after the operation at the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland. Image shows her parents at a press conference

The man had to have his jaw, palate and eye sockets reconstructed.

The world's first full-face transplant was carried out on a Spanish farmer in March 2010.

Oscar had blown most of his face off with a gun during a hunting accident and was left unable to breathe, swallow or talk properly.
