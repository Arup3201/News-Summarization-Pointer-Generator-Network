Lady Gaga is known for her love of outlandish fashion and her outfits never fail to grab headlines.

But the eccentric fashionista went one step further this week with a staggering 16 outfit changes.

The 28-year-old changed up to five times each day as she promoted her new album with Tony Bennett.

But how many clothes can one woman need? 

With an album with Tony Bennett and H&M collaboration to promote, the queen of pop has been keen to turn heads at every opportunity.

She put her fashion phonebook to good use yesterday as she stepped out in a number of outfits throughout the day while in New York.

At one point, the limelight-seeking singer, who is dating actor Taylor Kinney, showed off her curves in a plunging off the shoulder red gown adorned with sequins.

It came after an earlier outing in a peach vest and black skirt. Prior to that, she was pictured in a blue ribbed retro jumpsuit, and then a fur trimmed coat.

The singer teamed her ensemble with retro-style sunglasses with her hair in a high bun and a thick fringe which was later slicked back when she pulled on her evening dresses.

The day before, the pop star stepped out in not one but four different outfits for TV appearances to promote her new album of jazz classics, before changing for a fifth time to perform on stage with Bennett. 

Her outfits got more eye-catching by the minute, as she stepped out in a blue suede coat, a plunging red leather jumpsuit, a tight white dress and a taupe suit.

On stage at the Rockefeller Centre she transformed into an ice princess with a white low cut gown and furry snow coloured hat.

She also showed off her collection of accessories throughout the day wearing a selection of different hats, sunglasses and a black handbag.

On Monday, three different outfits were worn as she strolled around New York City including a glamorous white faux fur coat worn over a silky dress with an elaborate necklace, a lime green outfit with an unusual furry jacket and then wrapped up into another cream waist-tying coat paired with large shades and a hat. 

The Poker Face singer, famed for once wearing a dress made of meat, must have exceeded her luggage limit with the haul of clothes she packed for her trip to New York.

The week before, on Thanksgiving last Thursday, she was spotted spotting a more laidback look as she wore a flowing, silk floral print gown to go grocery shopping.

On the same day she changed into a striped green ensemble and posted a video on her Instagram page wishing followers happy Thanksgiving.
