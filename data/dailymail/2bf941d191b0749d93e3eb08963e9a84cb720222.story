Homes and roads in inner Melbourne have been hit by flash flooding.

The State Emergency Service has been inundated with calls for help, with 135 requests in one hour after heavy rainfall hit Melbourne about 3pm (AEST) on Tuesday.

A SES spokeswoman said most of the calls were for flooding in the inner north and east which were hit by flash flooding as the rain moved east.

In Camberwell, a Target store had to be evacuated as a section of the roof over the ladies clothing department collapsed in the rain, Fairfax Radio reports.
