Red Rooster will repay nearly half its workforce after an audit found it had underpaid staff in 2011 and 2012. The fast food chain will hand over $645,253 to 3,140 current and former employees.

The self-audit, which was instigated following complaints to the Fair Work Ombudsman from Red Rooster employees in 2011, found that all staff who's wages were investigated had been paid below award rates.

According to the Ombudsman, it is the largest repayment of any company that has entered into a self-audit or Proactive Compliance Deed, a mechanism for companies to resolve pay disputes with the Fair Work Ombudsman without facing a formal investigation. It follows a similar audit last year where Dominoes Pizza made $588,000 in back payments to underpaid pizza delivery drivers.

Red Rooster conducted the audit across 106 of its franchise stores, but according to the report, a 'significant proportion' of the underpayments were made at outlets operated by two franchisees in Queensland and the Northern Territory.

Australian fast food chain Red Rooster will fork out $645,000 to repay 3,140 current and former employees  - almost half its workforce - after an audit found they had been paid below award rates.

To date, 1,206 employees have been repaid. But payments to 1,934 others have been delayed or because 'trading conditions for some outlets have been tough,' the report states.

A total of 23 Red Rooster outlets have since gone into liquidation.

'Under the terms of the Deed, the franchisees found to have underpaid workers must ensure they repay employees in full. All money must be repaid by the end of this calendar year,' a Fair Work Ombudsman spokesperson told the Daily Mail.

On average, the 3,140 employees audited were underpaid about $205 each. However, individual underpayments were much larger in a number of cases. The largest amount of money recovered for any one individual was $3,035.

'Many of the young people working in Red Rooster franchises would have had little, or no previous work experience, and limited knowledge of their lawful entitlements,' said Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.

Red Rooster will fork out more than $645,000 to repay its employees, after an an audit of wages across 106 of its franchise stores found they were underpaid in 2011 and 2012

Red Rooster employs more than 7,000 people across 360 company-owned and franchise outlets in every State and Territory (except Tasmania).

In a company report, Quick Service Restaurant Holdings Pty Ltd, the Australian owner of Red Rooster, stated: 'on behalf of its Red Rooster franchisees it would like to state, for the record, that it was never their intention to underpay their employees.'

A spokesperson for Quick Service Restaurant Holdings, Todd Haywood, said it wasn't until 2011 that it was brought to the company's attention that the pay rate which had been agreed with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association Union was actually below the award wage.Â 

'It wasn't like it was something that hadn't been through the appropriate Industry processes,' he told the Daily Mail.

Mr Haywood says the company has implemented processes to ensure that any agreements across its operations comply with the award rates but says it is the responsibility of individual franchisees to make those payments back to staff.

'This is difficult in some cases because a few of those stores are actually no longer operating and because it's such a casual workforce with high staff turnover, a lot of those staff may actually not be at those franchises anymore.'

The Fair Work Ombudsman says it encourages any employee or former employee of Red Rooster who believes they may have been underpaid to get in touch with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
