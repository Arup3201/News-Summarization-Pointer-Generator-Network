Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad was taken to the hospital in an ambulance on Monday after he 'fell ill' at a public event.

'The governor was conscious and alert during the transport to the hospital,' Branstad's office said in a statement, noting that the 68-year-old had been 'suffering from the effects of a cold for a couple of days.'

'During the transport, paramedics took the governor’s vitals and initial tests indicate that the spell was caused by a seasonal illness,' his spokesman said.

Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad was taken to a hospital on Monday after he fell ill at an event in Johnston, Iowa. Branstad's  spokesman said he was conscious during the ambulance ride and that the governor has been fighting a cold. The spell Branstad experienced was c'aused by a seasonal illness,' his office said

Recently inaugurated for a sixth term, Branstad was giving remarks at the grand opening of a research facility in Johnston, Iowa, when he began having problems with his speech and balance.

The Des Moines Register said an attendee first offered him a bottle of water. He was later offered a chair, then laid down on the ground and transported to Iowa Methodist Medical Center. 

Branstad remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon but he 'doing much better,' the state's Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds said at an event later in the day, according to Des Moines TV station KCCI. 

'He'll be fine,' she added.

The governor's public schedule was cleared for the rest of the day as a precaution, his office said, and the governor was to remain in the infirmary overnight.

Branstad has had health issues in the past, including a heart attack in 2000 and a blocked artery several years ago.

During a press conference on Monday morning, Branstad admitted to reporters that he both he and Reynolds were sick.

'I have a bad cold, and so does the lieutenant governor, and we are not alone,' Branstad said, according to multiple reporters in attendance.

'We have had it off and on for some time. A couple weeks or more,' he revealed.

After Branstad took ill at DuPont Pioneer on Monday, Reynolds told the crowd that she and governor had 'both been fighting the flu over the past four days,' the Register said.

'We've tried very hard to keep up our schedule. If you know our great governor, he is not one to slow down or let up,' she said before officials cleared the room. 

Branstad was coming off a long weekend. Prospective Republican presidential candidates were in town for Iowa congressman Steve King's Freedom Summit, where they jockeyed for likely caucus-goers' support and Branstad's endorsement.

The Republican governor advised probable GOP candidates in attendance to visit all 99 of Iowa's counties if they want to win his state's voters in 2016.

'My advice is you skip Iowa at your own peril,' Branstad said, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 

'Rudy Giuliani thought that would be a good strategy and it didn’t work,' he said, referencing the former New York City mayor's ill-fated 2008 bid for the GOP nomination.

Other speakers at the conference included Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Hewlett Packard executive Carly Fiorina, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Likely 2016 candidates Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, Rand Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky and Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, skipped the forum.

Branstad told reporters on Monday that he'd spoken to Bush recently, however, and warned him not to avoid Iowa altogether if he runs. 

Bush's father, George H.W., ultimately lost the 1980 presidential election to Ronald Reagan, but he won the Iowa caucuses that year, Branstad recalled.

'The key to Iowa is hard work. It is come here early and often and connecting with Iowans' Branstad said at his press conference this morning at the Iowa Statehouse, according to the Des Moines Register.

 'I think some of the speakers did a good job of that on Saturday. I am glad that they are coming and I hope they will come back again and again.'
