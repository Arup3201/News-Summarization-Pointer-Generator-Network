Graffiti artists are used to hiding while they daub their works on walls as being caught would mean a telling off from the police.

But one German street-art duo have taken things a step further and started hiding their artwork as well.

Painted on the side of railings and steps, these fantastic images can only be viewed from certain angles, effectively hiding them in plain sight.

Zebrating are a German street art duo who have been decorating railings and steps across Europe with their tick-of-the-eye paintings

The wonderful artworks appear mostly in Germany in city such as Hamburg, Berlin and Stuttgart

Speedy: The works are made using spray paint and glue and take just 30 minutes to create

The artists behind these human portraits are male and female duo who go by the name 'Zebrating' and are touring German cities with their spray paints in a bid to jazz up boring street railings.

'Everybody can see our art when they're passing by, but the way we've designed it makes it only accessible to the people who walk around with open eyes,' said Zebrating.

'For our art you have to change your point of view, and take a few steps back to see it right.'

Much like rotating billboard adverts, the pictures only appear when viewed from a certain angle

Seen from a different point of view the picture slowly disappears and from the reverse angle nothing can be seen

The duo, who go by the name of Zebrating, said they were inspired to do it by the 'boring' railings

The paintings take half an hour to make each so this set of bars represents two and a half hours work

Zebrating have left their mark on various cities such as Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart, and even travelled to Paris in order to try to spread their passion of street art.

These masterpieces are made purely from spray paint and paste and only take 30 minutes to create, with the artists working against the clock to leave unseen.

'We had this big idea of what we wanted to do. We both recognised the hidden and still idle places perfect for street art, such as fences and railings.

At first glance what might look like ordinary road railings are in fact amazing works of art

The artists use mathematical trigonometry to work out how to divide up their paintings across the railings

Despite several run-ins with the police that hasn't stopped Zebrating artwork from springing up

As well as Germany the creative couple have taken their art abroad to Paris, a city known for its street artists

'They are always so grey and boring; we wanted to brighten up peoples journeys a bit. To make it happen, we needed a little bit of trigonometry knowledge and the courage to do it.'

Another street artist also on tour at the moment is world-renowned pioneer Banksy, who has vowed to put up a new artwork in New York every day until the end of October.

The show, entitled Better Out Than In, has seen three works spring up on walls in the city's art district.

Like most street artists Zebrating operate under the cloak of anonymity for fear of being caught

Their paintings mostly feature young women but also include male faces and eyeballs

Zebrating say people are confused by their works at first, but when they work out the trick they are always amazed

The latest, a dog urinating on a fire hydrant with a speech bubble which says 'you complete me', has already attracted a huge crowd.

Banksy shows are usually public and free for all, though his pieces are often hijacked by collectors who go on to sell them for hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The Bristol-born artist has never been identified and, like most graffiti artists including Zebrating, maintains an air of secrecy.
