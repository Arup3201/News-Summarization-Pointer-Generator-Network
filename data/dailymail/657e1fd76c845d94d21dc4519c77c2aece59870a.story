A clever new countertop cocktail machine allows drinks enthusiasts to create a variety of perfectly-mixed beverages using an app on their smartphone. 

The Somabar, which is the brainchild of US-based entrepreneurs Dylan Purcell-Lowe and Ammar Jangbawala, can make over 300 different cocktails, which can each be mixed in just five seconds after being ordered via the machine's corresponding app.

'Whether you are with your friends or just celebrating the end of a long work week, enjoying a craft cocktail is something that is easy to do - but making one is a pain, and requires time and preparation,' Somabar co-creator Dylan explains on the company's Kickstarter page.

'So we invented Somabar, to make delicious craft cocktails in under five seconds.' 

Each Somabar is fitted with WiFi, which is used to link the device with the user's smartphone, on which they can access the cocktail mixing app, which features a staggering 300 different beverage options, all of which can be customized according to each individual's tastes. 

In total, the machine took over three years to perfect - but both Ammar and Dylan are convinced their creation will wow anyone who gives it a go. 

'Three years ago, we started tinkering with electronic boards, pumps and a countless amount of liquor contains that, quite frankly, we can't even remember,' Ammar says.

'After testing several prototypes, we finally came up with a cool product that we are proud of.

Years in the making: Co-creators Dylan and Ammar spent three years perfecting the device's design

'Intelligent': The machine is said to make the 'perfect' cocktail, with just the right mixture of ingredients

'Somabar allows you to make craft cocktails without having to use a shaker, bar spoon, measuring cup or recipe book.'

Each device can be loaded with six different airtight drinks containers, which can be filled with all manner of alcoholic and non-alcoholic options, depending on which drinks prove most popular in each individual kitchen.

The in-app menu contains all manner of drinks mix, from traditional favorites such as Whisky Sours and Gin and Tonics to the more exotic options such as Sake Lemon Drops and Green Russians.

'Somabar is an intelligent mixologist,' Dylan says. 

'It gives you the technology to infuse bitters, pour precisely, and thoroughly mix every cocktail, all before dispensing at the push of a button.'

The possibilities are endless: Dylan and Ammar have created an extensive menu that can be extended to include each user's own creations

The design duo is currently taking pre-orders for the first batch of Somabars, which are available via the brand's Kickstarter page for $399 each, a $100 reduction from the normal pre-order price. 

'We need your help to get to the next stage,' the pair explain. 'Tooling and manufacturing costs are really expensive and without your support, we will not be able to make Somabar a reality.'

Thus far, the duo's Somabar project has raised more than $193,000 via its Kickstarter page, smashing Ammar and Dylan's original crowd-funding target of $50,000. 

Supporters have a wide variety of donation options to choose from, with the most expensive - a $2,000 pledge - guaranteeing the generous benefactor a personal visit from Somabar's creators, who will provide a personal consultation in order to ensure that the machine is correctly-installed.
