Carbon monoxide has apparently killed a family of four, among them two children, in an eastern Pennsylvania home where police found a car running in the garage.

State police Lt. Vincent D'Angelo says authorities haven't yet determined whether the car was left running intentionally as part of a murder-suicide plot, or whether it was an accident.

Police were called to the Reitnauer family's 1525 Kumry Road in Milford Township at 11.20pm Monday, and found it filled with carbon monoxide coming from the attached garage.

The fire department also responded and discovered the victims. Paramedics on the scene attempted to revive the family, but it was too late.

D'Angelo says police are not looking for a suspect, and that there is no danger to the public.

The victims have been identified as 59-year-old Gary Reitnauer, his wife, Michele, 58, and their two adopted daughters, 16-year-old Yun Jiao 'Kimberly' Cao and Jamie Hongfan Reitnauer, 10, according to The Morning Call.

Autopsies will be performed on the victims to determine the exact cause of death, but as of Tuesday afternoon, a representative of the Bucks County Coroner's Office told MailOnline the procedures have yet to be scheduled.

PhillyBurbs.com reported that the family of four living in a house at the rear of Mayer's Well Drilling company consisted of the couple and two daughters adopted from Asia.

Police officers responded to the home on Kumry Road after getting a request to check up on the welfare of residents living there.

Sources tell ABC Action News that Gary Reitnauer's body was inside a car with the motor running and the garage door closed.

Michelle Reitnauer and one of their children were also found dead inside the garage. Another girl was discovered inside the house. 

Rob Zere, who identified himself as Mr Reitnauer's nephew, told CBS Philly: 'the family was trying to save each other, and it didn't work out.'

Quakertown Community School District Superintendent Lisa Andrejko posted the following message to the school district's website informing parents and students about the tragic incident and asking the community to pray for the family.

The school district made arrangements to bring in counselors to help students and staff cope with the loss.

Mayer's manager Paul Moser described the victims as a nice family who appeared loving. Speaking of the husband, Moser said Gary Reitnauer always appeared happy and laughing in the office.

The family lived in the five-bedroom house for about 15 years. The kids' grandmother lived on the property in a trailer.

Bucks County property records show the home on Kumry Road is owned by Gary Reitnauer, who has a company registered on his name called Right Now Engineering Inc.
