A U.S. Marine who lost both his legs in Afghanistan just three weeks after being deployed and suffered from crippling depression as a result has managed to heroically complete the Chicago marathon this weekend

Using a hand bike, ultra-competitive Ben Maenza, 24, finished the 26.2 mile race only two years after he lost both limbs and credits his recovery to a religious experience during which he came to know that he could not give up despite wanting to end it all.

'People think you can’t do stuff like that without your legs, so being out there and proving that you can and making it happen, it’s really gratifying,' said Maenza before he completed the 26.2 mile race in one-hour 48 minutes.

Lance Cpl. Maenza, from Nashville, Tennessee, had not yet completed a full month of his deployment working as a combat engineer in the Marine Corps, when he lost his legs in a horrific accident.

'We were walking through a cornfield and came to a river we needed to cross,' said Maenza to ABC News.

'I felt it was a bad idea, but we did it anyway.  It was my job to clear the trail.  

'I was standing on the riverbed, and the guy behind me stepped off my trail and hit a pressure plate that was offset from an improvised explosive device (IED) that I was standing on top of. 

'The bomb detonated underneath me.'

The explosion caused Maenza to instantly lose both his legs and to suffer deep gashes, burns and nerve damage to his arms in addition to nasal and skull fractures.

Technically dying in the field, the quick actions of a medic ensured that Maenza was resuscitated, after which he was rushed to a military hospital in Germany where he began an 18-month rehabilitation process.

However, despite surviving the explosion, Maenza entered into a deep depression.

'You don’t know where you’re going to go – you just know you lost your legs and emotionally, mentally, life’s over,' said Maenza to Fox News.

'There’s nothing to live for.'

Stuck in a terrible rut for six-months, Maenza started to pull through after he had a religious experience.

'I had a divine intervention with God,' said Maenza.

'This wasn’t what my life was going to be like. Losing my legs was not going to determine who I was going to be. 

'I died – they had to bring me back to life – I got this second chance, and I wasn’t going to settle for mediocrity.'

It was while hospitalised at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Maenza was introduced to representatives from Achilles International, an organisation which helps people with extreme disabilities compete in mainstream athletics.

'Achilles came in and said, 'Hey, we don't feel sorry for you because we know you can do better than this, you are not just a patient in this hospital, you are an athlete; you are a competitor,' said Maenza.

The non-profit organisation was founded in 1983 and funds the Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans - and encouraged Maenza to compete in two marathons and to cycle across the nation from Florida to California.

'It was exactly what I needed at that point in my recovery,' said the injured veteran to WKRN.

'I was at a crossroads. They came in and gave me a way to get a sense of accomplishment.

'It gives you something to work towards, the knowledge that you are capable and you can do it.'

'I never really was a runner or a cyclist before, but when Achilles approached me and asked me to do it, it kind of lit a fire in me and, quite frankly, I’m pretty good at it.'

Despite finishing the race in under two hours, Maenza was not totally happy with his performance.

'Obviously, I was a little slower than I intended, but I’ve got a good excuse, my wheel was broken,' said Maenza.

'Now I’m going to continue to train harder and push to the limit. I can use it as motivation for my next race.'

Now studying for a college degree, Maenza takes inspiration from his progress over the past two years.

'The message is, with the right attitude and determination, you can succeed anything that’s put in your way,' said Maenza.

'Life’s not over if you lost your legs, or you have diabetes, or you’re overweight, whatever.

'No matter what you’re faced with, you can do great things.  I just want people to know if we can do it, they can do it.'
