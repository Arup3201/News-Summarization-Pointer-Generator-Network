A superb score in his penultimate round saw Great Britain's Jack Laugher snatch a bronze medal in the men's 3m springboard final at the FINA Diving World Cup in Shanghai on Saturday.

The 19-year-old, who finished second in the semi-final on Friday, scored 488.20 overall to secure his first major senior international medal.

China claimed the top two spots as He Chong (540.35) won gold and Cao Yuan (526.70) took silver.

A podium finish looked far from guaranteed for Laugher who, after a disappointing opening effort, hauled himself back into contention with a second-round score of 94.50 for his reverse 3.5 somersaults with tuck.

The teenager slipped to eighth, however, after an over-rotated entry on his third dive but an excellent 102.60 in the penultimate round - a forward 4.5 somersaults tucked - fired him into third place.

Laugher, who has won individual medals at the last three consecutive legs of this year's FINA Diving World Series, then held off Ukraine's Illya Kvasha (486.15) with his final dive, scoring 81 for his back 3.5 somersaults.
