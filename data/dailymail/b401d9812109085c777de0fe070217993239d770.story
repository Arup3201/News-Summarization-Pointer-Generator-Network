New role: Helen Boaden, the executive in charge of BBC News when the Jimmy Savile controversy erupted

The BBC’s most high-profile woman executive is moving to a new job just days before the release of explosive transcripts into the Corporation’s handling of the Savile scandal.

Helen Boaden, formerly director of news, is to become director of radio following months of speculation about her future.

The switch is technically a sideways move for Miss Boaden, 56, although some regard running the huge news operation as the bigger role.

Confirmation of her move comes shortly before the BBC publishes thousands of pages of evidence used by former head of Sky News Nick Pollard in his report into why Newsnight ditched an investigation into Jimmy Savile.

Miss Boaden, 56, had been criticised in the report for failing to tackle the ‘virtual meltdown’ in parts of the news department.

The testimonies, emails and texts are expected to be published at the end of next week and insiders admit that some of them may be embarrassing to a number of senior BBC executives.

Miss Boaden, who has been in charge of BBC News since 2004, was told last week that incoming director general Lord Hall would like her to move to radio and  yesterday the BBC confirmed this will take place after Easter.

Miss Boaden, a former controller of Radio 4, said: ‘It is a huge pleasure to be returning to my first love of radio. The British public love BBC Radio and I intend to cherish and champion it.’

Change: Former culture secretary James Purnell, right, is to join the BBC in a major strategic role. The appointments have been made by incoming director-general Tony Hall, left,  before he takes up his position

At the height of the Savile crisis she temporarily ‘stepped aside’ from her £340,000 a year role, and it was later revealed she had at one point offered to resign.

There is speculation that the former editor of The Times, James Harding, will be handed her former post.

Mr Hall said of his appointments to the senior management team: 'I am building a senior team that will define the BBC and public service broadcasting for the next decade.

'It will be a team that is made up of outstanding talent from outside the BBC combined with the best people from within.

'There will be more changes over the coming months and there is a lot of hard work ahead but today's appointments are the first steps in delivering that vision.'

There will also be changes to the role which acting director-general Tim Davie will take on in April when Mr Hall arrives.

Mr Hall was appointed director-general following the resignation of George Entwistle, after just 54 days in the job.

Mr Entwistle quit, saying that as editor-in chief he had to take 'ultimate responsibility' for a Newsnight investigation that had led to the former Conservative Party treasurer, Lord McAlpine, being wrongly accused of child abuse.

Change of direction: Boaden is understood to have previously been offered the job by the then director general George Entwistle, who left in November (seen here resigning next to Lord Patten,) but turned it down

Mr Davie - formerly the director of BBC audio and music - will become CEO of the corporation's commercial arm BBC Worldwide, and this role is being expanded to include 'a more strategic global perspective'.

This will involve developing the BBC's international brand and editorial strategy.

Mr Davie said: 'I am very pleased to take on the important task of building the BBC brand globally and leading a growing, creative BBC Worldwide.'

BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music controller Bob Shennan had been an early 
favourite for the radio role, which was previously held by Tim
Davie.

As director of news, Miss Boaden was responsible for more than 8,000 staff and was in charge of all of the broadcaster’s news and current affairs output, including Question Time, Panorama, the Today Programme and Newsnight.

Ms Boaden said: 'It is a huge pleasure to be returning to my first love of radio. I look forward to working with our outstanding controllers and some of the most creative on and off air talent in the BBC'

It is known that she told Mr Entwistle – then running BBC TV – at an awards lunch last year that Newsnight was planning to run a report about claims that Savile abused young girls, which could affect Mr Entwistle’s plans for Christmas shows paying tribute to the presenter.

In a memo to news staff, Ms Boaden 
said that her move was a 'bittersweet moment', as she listed some of the
notable moments in output during her tenure in news.

They included coverage of the Asian 
tsunami, the banking crisis, the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the 
Arab Uprising, the edition of Question Time featuring BNP leader Nick 
Griffin and the hunt for gunman Raoul Moat, as well as the Olympic Torch
relay.

She wrote: 'I confess that it is a 
bittersweet moment for me. Everyone knows that I love radio and always 
have. So naturally I genuinely relish returning to this cherished and 
uniquely creative part of the BBC, especially under a new DG 
(director-general) who is passionate about its importance.

'But leaving News and all of you is 
undoubtedly a wrench. I believe I may be the longest serving Head of 
News over the past 25 years.'

She added: 'It has been a huge privilege and an absolute pleasure to lead you.'

Sources at Newsnight have also suggested that she warned the programme’s then editor, Peter Rippon – who has also since stepped aside – that he needed to be sure of his facts before screening any claims that Savile was a criminal.

She resumed her role as director of BBC 
News in December after further blunders - caused by a change in the 
chain of command in news while an inquiry was ongoing - led to Lord 
McAlpine being wrongly identified as being involved in a sexual abuse 
scandal.

She began at the corporation almost 30 years ago, working as a news producer at BBC Radio Leeds before going on to work as a reporter and then editor of Radio 4’s File on 4, and as a presenter on Woman’s Hour.

She took responsibility for business programmes on the station in 1997 and was made station controller three years later.

Fiercely defensive of the station’s ‘intelligent’ programming that ‘feeds the mind’ she helped it to reach audiences of 10million for the first time.

Despite running Radio 4 during another BBC crisis – when an infamous Today programme  report sparked the Hutton Inquiry – she escaped censure because the show is governed by the BBC News division.

In the wake of the scandal Miss Boaden was promoted to become said division’s first female director in 2004.

Last year she applied to become director general but was beaten by Mr Entwistle.

It is understood she was offered a senior role in radio instead, but turned it down.

Ms Boaden said Fran Unsworth would become acting director of news from March 19.

She took that position during the period in which Ms Boaden stepped aside.
