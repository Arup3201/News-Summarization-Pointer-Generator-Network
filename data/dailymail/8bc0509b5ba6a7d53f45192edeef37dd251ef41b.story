These emotional portraits show the final moments of stray dogs before they are put to death in an animal pound.

The series, taken in government-run pounds in Taiwan, show the dogs as little as half an hour before pound workers humanely put them down.

Photographer Yun-Fei Tou used human portrait techniques to bring the scruffy animals' faces fully to life, and wants viewers to 'witness the decay of life moments before death' in the dogs' unknowing expressions.

None of the animals is named - instead each portrait is simply identified by how long after the image was taken they were killed. The times vary from 14 hours to 29 minutes.

Explaining the series, dubbed Memento Mori (Latin for 'remember you will die), he said: 'These nameless animals, by virtue of the size at, which they are printed and the approximations to human scale, are transformed into existence... The status of power between humans and other sentient beings, those considered "the other" is diminished.'
