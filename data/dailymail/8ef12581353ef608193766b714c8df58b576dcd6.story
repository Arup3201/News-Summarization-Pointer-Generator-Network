Thames Valley Police, which is responsible for the PM's Witney constituency, has been the victim of 90 crimes over the past three years (file photo)

David Cameron's local police force is the most
crime-hit in Britain, new figures revealed today.

Thames Valley Police, which is responsible
for the PM's Witney constituency, has itself been the victim of 90 separate
crimes over the past three years.

The force suffered 88 thefts from patrol
cars and two from its police stations.

Figures released under the Freedom of
Information Act also revealed that an average of nearly one police station or
patrol car in England and Wales is broken into or firebombed every day.

Between 2008 and 2011, brazen thieves
stole officers' boots, helmets, CCTV cameras, cash, ink cartridges, a
wheelbarrow, a Union Jack flag, a sword and even a bottle of cider.

Greater Manchester Police was the second
most crime-hit force with 45 thefts from its patrol cars and ten burglaries from
its stations.

Arsonists have also set fire to eight of
the force's police stations.

South Yorkshire Police emerged as the
third most crime-hit, with 55 thefts from its patrol cars and four arson
attacks against its stations.

An average of nearly one police station or patrol car in England and Wales is broken into or firebombed every day. Pictured, Canning Circus police station in Nottingham after it was firebombed in August during the England riots

The force even had one of its patrol cars
stolen from a school car park during an operation at Armthorpe Comprehensive School, near Doncaster.

Before the riots in August, a total of 27
forces across England and Wales reported 496 separate break-ins, thefts and
arson attacks since the middle of 2008.

That is the equivalent of 1,010 crimes in
total committed against England and Wales forces outside of London over the
last three years.

The figures, which do not include those
committed against the Met, means police forces enjoy just 27 crime-free days a
year.

1. Thames Valley: 90 crimes reported

2. Greater Manchester: 63

3. South Yorkshire: 60

4. Essex: 39

5.
Cambridgeshire: 27

AND THOSE LEAST HIT...

1. Cumbria, Dorset and
Northamptonshire: Both zero

2. Norfolk and Gwent: Both 2

3. Gloucestershire: 3

4. Durham and Surrey: Both 4

5. Cheshire: 5 

Essex Police is the fourth most crime-hit
force suffered 39 burglaries with thieves pinching a pair of officers' boots
and £1,000 worth of ink cartridges.

Cheeky crooks also nabbed a Union Jack and
a police flag from the flagpole outside Thurrock police station.

Bizarrely, burglars even made off with a
wheelbarrow from Chelmsford police station earlier this year.

A raider even managed to steal a sword
from Avon and Somerset Police.

Red-faced chiefs at Lancashire Police
admitted crooks stole three police hats and £2,000 worth of CCTV equipment from
one of its stations.

One thief even swiped a confiscated bottle
of cider from the back seat of a patrol car in October 2009.

Thugs targeted a rural beat officer's home
in Lancashire in November 2010 when they pushed a firework through his letter
box while his family slept upstairs.

Marked police cars have also been targeted
across England and Wales with thieves stealing helmets, a mileage book and even
a gear stick knob.

Meanwhile, Cumbria Police, Dorset Police
and Northamptonshire Police were the most respected constabularies, reporting
no crimes against their property.

Norfolk Police reported only two incidents
- one police vehicle break-in in May 2009 in Norwich and another in October
2009 in Wymondham.

Gwent Police reported one theft from its
Rogerstone station in Newport - when a police bicycle was stolen. 

Of the
55 FoI requests made, 28 forces, including the Met Police, refused to release
the figures.
