She is one of the top human rights lawyers in the country and is married to one of the most famous men in the world, so it is no wonder Amal Clooney always looks effortlessly chic when she steps out into the public eye.

The London-based lawyer's wardrobe has gone from strength-to-strength since she tied the knot with George Clooney in Venice, Italy, last September.

From elegant cream jumpsuits to panel shift dresses and suit/skirt combos, the 37-year-old always seems to get the balance of smart and sexy just right. 

But her effortless look is not without the help of a few designer items.

From Prada and Stella McCartney to Dolce & Gabbana and Alexander McQueen, the stylish lawyer seems to spare no expense when it comes to dressing herself.

Several of the outfits she has been photographed in since her lavish wedding to the world-famous actor cost at least £1,000, with the star spending a whopping £66,900 alone on the clothes she is pictured wearing in this feature.
