In 1963, then-12-year-old Dennis Komsa wrote a note on a piece of paper, put it in a glass mason jar and hurled it into the Atlantic Ocean near Sampson Avenue in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, hoping it would some day be returned to him.

In November of 2012, nearly 50 years after Komsa tossed his message in a bottle into the ocean, the bottle was found. But not on some exotic, tropical island as Komsa might have hoped - it was found a quarter of a mile away from where Komsa had thrown it in.

The bottle was found by Norman Stanton about a week after Hurricane Sandy devastated the New Jersey coast - he was picking through some debris outside his sister's home when he saw the jar away from the other bits of rubbish scattered throughout the yard.

Message in a bottle: This note was found in November last year - nearly 50 years after it was tossed into the Atlantic Ocean

Message from the past: Hurricane Sandy tossed the message in a bottle into a back yard a quarter of a mile from where it was tossed into the sea

Science experiment: Komsa, seen here with his father, would often do these types of 'experiments' when he was growing up

Against the odds: The mason jar contained the 12-year-old's letter along with a 5 cent piece so that whoever found the letter could write back

Postage: Dennis Komsa included a 1958 nickel in the bottle so whoever found it could mail him answers to his questions

Rather than throw it out with the rest of the debris, Stanton put it on his sister's deck and got back to work.

'It looked like it was meant to be found,' Stanton, 53, told the Asbury Park Press.

The note Stanton recovered was dated Saturday August 16, 1963, and had the following written on it in all capital letters: 'To whom it may concern, Please fill out the following questions and 
mail.

'This is a scientific experiment by Dennis Komsa, age 12.'

The questions written on the note were
'where was the jar found? When was it found? How was it found? And 
anything else which might help me.'

Included
in the jar was Komsa's address in nearby Patterson, New Jersey and five
cents for whomever found the note to buy a stamp.

Record? Komsa's bottle was about 50 years shy of setting a record for the amount of time passed before a message in a bottle was found

Cleanup: Norman Stanton points to the spot where he found the jar while cleaning up after Hurricane Sandy

Now 61 and living in Hillsborough, New Jersey, Komsa told the paper he's shocked the bottle was recovered.

'Things happen for a reason. I guess itâ€™s good it came to shore. It shows anything is possible,' he said.

He added, 'my father and I used to do stuff like that all the time.'

Komsa said he called the Guinness Book of World Records to find out if his bottle had broken any records. Unfortunately, the record for a bottle found after being tossed to sea was set in 2012 by a fisherman from the United Kingdom. That bottle spent 97 years and 309 days at sea.

The bottle was returned to Komsa on Saturday when he attended a a luncheon in honor of the borough's 100th birthday.
