A Christmas attraction designed by TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen went bust - owing creditors nearly £1million.

The Magical Journey, based at the Belfry Hotel, in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, was marred with controversy before closing just nine days before Christmas - leaving furious parents out of pocket.

Liquidators hired to handle the firm said creditors are owed in the region of £875,000 following the early closure of the attraction, which cost upwards of £50 for a family of three.

Flamboyant TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen (centre) had been hired to design the attraction, which opened its doors in November. It was forced to close on 16 December - just nine days before Christmas

They said company directors blamed poor weather, the site's temporary closure, negative publicity and higher-than-anticipated costs for the closure. 

They added that when 'anticipated investment' failed to materialise, organisers had no choice but to shut down early. 

The festive experience opened its doors in November and was forced to close just one day later following a furious backlash from angry parents.

The furore broke out after a barrage of complaints on the first day over elves smoking, rubbish being strewn across the paths and wooden pallets covered in plastic tarpaulin left lying around.

Parents also complained that the train to Santa's grotto broke down on the opening day. 

Event director Paul Dolan had claimed that bad weather hampered first-day preparations and it had not been ready to open. 

It reopened several days later after work to improve it, winning positive customer reviews - but last month the organisers said they had been 'left in the lurch' and could not find a replacement backer.

Scenes like this greeted visitors when the site first opened. Despite a raft of measures to make improvements, the attraction  closed early - leaving furious parents out of pocket

When it closed its doors, there were claims that the crisis-hit attraction crumbled under pressure to pay its staff wages of more than £100,000 per month - just nine days before Christmas.

Angry parents were told to contact their card providers for refunds with many buying tickets for their entire families.

At the time, Mr Llewelyn-Bowen said he had not given any financial support to the project and was unaware of the backer's identity. 

Mr Povey, one of the liquidators, said: 'The directors of Magical Journeys Limited faced a number of significant challenges and attribute the failure to a combination of poor weather hampering site preparation, the temporary closure of the attraction, leading to negative publicity which had an impact on ticket sales, and higher-than-anticipated costs.

The attraction had to be shut down after a catastrophic flop on its opening day in November following negative feedback from visitors on social media

'When anticipated investment failed to materialise, they had no option but to close the attraction early.

'We are in the process of reviewing creditors' claims and investigating if there are any assets which can be realised for the benefit of creditors.

'We'll be reporting back to creditors with the results of our investigations into the company's affairs in due course.'    

A statement on the attraction's website notes it has ceased trading and has not been in operation since December 16.

Creditors of the Magical Journey, based at the Belfry Hotel, in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, (pictured) are owed in the region of £875,000, liquidators have said. The hotel had 'no affiliation' with the attraction

Amid repeated apologies it states: 'We have explored all our options, and the situation leaves us with no alternative other than close the Magical Journey.'

It added: 'We are truly sorry. After all we've been through, having to shut down in the final week is devastating.

'Although we had quite the time of it in the press and on social media, feedback was great with over 600 four-and five-star reviews.

'However, today a key financial backer has dropped out, leaving us in the lurch. We have tried desperately over the last few hours to find a replacement but to no avail.'
