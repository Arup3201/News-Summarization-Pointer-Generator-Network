Ed Balls' flagship Labour plan to ‘guarantee’ jobs for every young person unemployed for a year is ‘pie in the sky’, Iain Duncan Smith said last night.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said the scheme would not work, simply creating short-term placements in the public sector at vast cost to taxpayers.

Under the plan, 18 to 24-year-olds out of work for a year will be offered a taxpayer-funded job for six months, with those who refuse losing benefits.

Labour faced searching questions over the funding of the scheme, which it said would cost £5.5billion and be met with another tax raid on the pension pots of the better-off and a new tax on bankers’ bonuses.

Ed Miliband said the scheme was ‘fully costed’ and ‘right and fair’.

People on the 45p top rate of tax would get only 20 per cent tax relief on pension contributions, instead of the 45 per cent they receive now. Labour would also repeat its one-off 2009 tax on bank bonuses.

But critics pointed out the party has previously earmarked a bankers’ bonus tax to reverse the Coalition’s increase in VAT, tax credit changes and child benefit cuts.

The Tories said the party had suggested using new bank taxes to fund at least ten commitments. The Tories said official costings suggest the policy would cost £1.7billion more than Labour claims.

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘They’re 
re-spending the bankers’ bonus tax yet again – and raiding hard earned 
pensioners’ savings. The last Labour government did huge damage to 
savings and now they’re proposing to do it again.’

Repetition? Iain Duncan Smith said Miliband's scheme echoes a failed one done by the previous Labour government

He said Labour’s suggestion that 80 per cent of the placements would be in the private sector was ‘pie in the sky’, pointing out not one employer has signed up although the party trailed the scheme a year ago. He added: ‘Fundamentally, this type of scheme just doesn’t work.

‘Labour’s Future Jobs Fund, which this scheme looks very similar to, created short-term placements predominantly in the public sector. Each placement cost £6,500, and half of participants were back on benefits as soon as their time on the scheme was up.

‘Now they are proposing another expensive scheme which will just involve more borrowing and more taxes to pay for.’

Mr Duncan Smith said the Government’s work experience scheme was available to the young unemployed from day one, rather than after a year of unemployment.

It was costing around £325 per place, 20 times cheaper than Labour’s Future Jobs Fund, and had been shown to be effective at getting people off benefits and into work.

Mr Miliband insisted: ‘We’ve got 56,000 young people who have been unemployed for over 12 months, a Labour government will tax the bankers’ bonuses and put our young people back to work.’

But James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Persistently high youth unemployment is a blight on our economy, but Labour’s job scheme does not bear much scrutiny as a solution. No government can pull a lever in Whitehall and expect youth unemployment to disappear.

‘Whilst a short-term placement may help some young people gain experience, it ignores the fundamental reasons for long-term unemployment, such as a welfare system which gives young people little incentive to get off benefits, and an education system that has failed to give them the skills and attitude they need to get a job.’

Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned the Government had already done ‘a lot’ to restrict pension tax relief available to higher earners and Labour’s proposal to launch a further raid was ‘extraordinarily complex’.
