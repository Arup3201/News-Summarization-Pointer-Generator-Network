Disgraced: Rolf Harris, with this trademark spectacles removed for this police-issue photo

He was one of our best-loved entertainers, charming the nation’s families and the Queen alike over five decades.

Yet all the while Rolf Harris was hiding behind his wholesome image as children’s TV presenter, musician and artist to sexually prey on dozens of women and girls as young as seven. 

Yesterday the 84-year-old was facing the rest of his life behind bars after a jury convicted him of being a predatory paedophile. 

Prosecutors say Harris believed his fame placed him above the law – he acted ‘in plain sight and without fear of consequences’.

His victims included his daughter’s 13-year-old friend. 

After his eight-week trial ended yesterday, it can be revealed that:

The Australian-born star betrayed little emotion as he was convicted of all 12 counts of indecent assault relating to four girls aged seven to 19.

He sat motionless, staring straight ahead as the unanimous verdicts were returned after 30 hours of deliberations following the trial at Southwark Crown Court in South London.

He left the courtroom without a word, glancing at his wife of 56 years with his eyebrows raised as he gave her a half-hearted wave.

Alwen Hughes, 82, battled to maintain her composure, with only the muscles in her jaw working furiously and betraying her inner turmoil.

His daughter Bindi Nicholls, 50, who stood by her father despite his abuse of her best friend leaving her suicidal at one point, tightly grasped her aunt Jenny’s arm for support, blinking back tears.

Later, he linked arms with his wife, daughter and niece as they faced the cameras outside, remaining silent as he was asked whether he would apologise to his victims.   

Last night his daughter’s best friend said: ‘I’m very relieved, that’s all I’m prepared to say.’ 

Another victim, BBC reporter Letitia Fitzpatrick, said: ‘I’m so relieved for all the women who came forward and all of those who haven’t, to see him being exposed for what he is – a predatory paedophile, an opportunistic sexual predator.’

Harris could face years behind bars as three of the 12 counts carry a possible ten-year sentence.  

Releasing him on unconditional bail, Mr Justice Sweeney warned him: ‘Given the conviction on all 12 counts it is inevitable that the type of sentence that is upmost in the court’s mind is a custodial sentence, and he must understand that.’ 

During his trial, the court heard that Harris had hidden the dark side of his ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ personality.

Carefully concealing the ‘demon lurking beneath his charming exterior’ he used his fame to beguile innocent and impressionable young fans mesmerised by his talent. 

He groomed his daughter’s best friend for 16 years, assaulting her while Bindi, then 16, slept just yards away.

The years of abuse transformed the girl from a care-free child from a prosperous middle-class family to an alcoholic teenager who spiralled into depression and despair.

Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC described his victim, now 49, as a ‘damaged and emotionally dead creature’, adding: ‘He used her for his sexual gratification like she was a blow-up doll.’

Throughout the case, Harris maintained it was she who had seduced him at the age of 18 when he was 53.

But the star’s damning letter – written to her father in 1997 begging for forgiveness – told a different story.

His other victims included a seven-year-old autograph hunter he ‘aggressively fondled’ after performing his hit Two Little Boys in 1969.

He also molested a 14-year-old waitress during filming of a celebrity knockout show in Cambridge in 1978 and 15-year-old child actress Tonya Lee during a youth theatre tour in 1986. 

A further six women gave evidence as supporting witnesses for the prosecution about the cartoonist dubbed ‘the Octopus’ in TV circles for his wandering hands.

Seven other victims – including a celebrity who was molested as she interviewed him live on TV – gave statements but were not called as witnesses.

He is the second person to be convicted under Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree probe, launched in the wake of the Savile scandal. 

PR guru Max Clifford was caged for eight years in May for indecently assaulting four victims, the youngest aged 15.

Yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector Mick Orchard said: ‘He committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law.’

Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor in London, said: ‘Each victim, unknown to the others, described a similar pattern of behaviour; that of a man acting without fear of the consequences.’ 

Harris was bailed until Friday when he will be sentenced.

His only child hoped to inherit £11million. But with the prospect of lengthy and expensive legal battles ahead as victims file damages claims, and his paintings plummeting in value, much of Rolf Harris’s fortune could be wiped out. 

Recent published accounts show that his millions are tied up in a network of companies and family trusts, two of which were set up in 2012 – months before he faced police investigation.

His oldest company, Rolf Harris Enterprises, was launched in 1963.

It has £1.13million in the bank and £2.5million in assets, with directors including his brother Bruce Harris, wife Alwen, niece Jennifer Harris and daughter Bindi Nicholls.

A separate company set up in January 2012 called Rhel Holdings lists Harris and his wife as shareholders and Bruce, Alwen and Jenny Harris as directors. 

Figures show it contains profits of £1,654,379 and capital of £2,080,528 from Rolf Harris Enterprises.

A third company, RHE Investments – also set up in 2012 – is a family trust which controls £1.6million in cash and £5.3million in fixed assets and investments.

But Southwark Crown Court heard Bindi was anxious that her future should be secured.

She wrote an email to her parents on July 25, 2012 – before his arrest – referring to an inheritance of ‘around £11million’. 

She said: ‘I understand that I am sole inheritor of your estate – is this true? If I am, then I feel you both have to sit down and discuss your feelings or beliefs about this inheritance.

‘If I am going to inherit this money, I need to be part of the running of the company as it will be my responsibility in the future? It’s a massive responsibility that I need to understand and feel empowered by and part of...

‘Please imagine how it is for me... figures in millions are being talked about willy-nilly.

‘It’s like being told that you might be winning the lottery at some point and you get excited and dream about the things you “could” do.’
