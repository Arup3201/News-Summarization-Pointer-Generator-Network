A family escaped being hurt after a runaway car ploughed into their sitting room seconds after they left the room to go and inspect the father's DIY in a bedroom.

Dylan Harries, wife Jody, and his stepchildren Sam, 19, and Hannah, 15, had just nipped upstairs to admire Mr Harries' work when the Citroen C4 smashed into their house in Penarth, south Wales.

The car took out the front wall of the house in a quiet residential street, shattering the windows and television and leaving the room littered with broken glass and splintered wood.

The Harries family had left the sitting room just before a car ploughed into the house in Penarth, south Wales

Wreckage: The wall, windows, television, DVD player and ornaments were all smashed in the accident

Mr Harries, 31, a painter and decorator, said: 'I can't bear to think about what might have happened.'

He said it sounded 'like a bomb exploding' when the accident happened at 11.45pm on Saturday night.

The family ran outside and watched as the driver of the car attempted to reverse out of the wreckage of the house.

Mr Harries said they saw a man from the back seat collapse out of the car, and a woman in the front passenger seat.

A doctor eating at a restaurant over the road saw what had happened and ran over to help the man from the back seat until an ambulance arrived.

Mr Harries said: 'Our whole home is a complete disaster.  Everything has been ruined and there is rubble everywhere.

What a mess: The accident happened after Mr Harries had spent hours decorating his step-daughter's room

Structurally unstable: The house is now said to be unsafe and the Harries family are staying with family nearby

'There is no front wall and he took out the windows too, as well as the TV, the DVDs, the surround sound system, all the ornaments - all have been destroyed.'

He added: 'We don’t have contents insurance so that’s all gone, but also priceless stuff like ornaments the kids had given my wife, and the only framed photograph I have of my late dad - all ruined.'

After the car was recovered from the house there was a large hole in the front of the £700-a-month rented semi, leaving it structurally unstable, so the Harries family is now staying with family nearby.

Police said Sean Richard Sweeney, 30, from 
Llandough, has been charged with failing to provide a specimen for 
analysis and dangerous driving.  He will appear before Cardiff 
Magistrates Court on July 18.

The car was removed from the house by a crane, leaving a gaping hole in the front wall of the property
