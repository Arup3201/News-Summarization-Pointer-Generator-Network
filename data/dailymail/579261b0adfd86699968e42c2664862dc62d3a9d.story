They are billed as the next must-have gadget for the living room - but experts today warned the latest curved TV sets may not be worth the money.

Manufacturers such as LG have shown off curved screens at the CES show in Las Vegas this week, with Samsung even having a ‘shape shifting’ screen that can go from flat to curved at the press of a button.

The TV firms say the sets make for a more cinema-like experience.

Speaking at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas, experts claim that curved screens may be better suited to smaller devices, used by one person at a time

Joe Stinziano of Samsung said ‘the wider field of view and panoramic effect draws viewers in’.

However, the firm has tried to cater to both sides of the market with a ‘bendable TV’.

Motors in the back of the TV cause if to bend from flat to curved at the press of a button - although Samsung did not say how much it would cost, or when or if it would become available.

‘It’s all about giving the customer control over their viewing experience,’ Mr Stinziano said, during a keynote most remembered for director Michael Bay walking off stage after claiming his auto cue was broken.

Curved TVs are expensive compared to normal flat TVs. For instance, the Samsung's 55-inch curved TV (pictured) costs around £7,000 compared to around £2,000 for its flat screen equivalent

The TV firms say the sets make for a more cinema-like experience.

'It’s an interesting idea, but its 
solving a problem that doesn’t need to be solved,’ said Stuart Miles of 
gadget site Pocket Lint.

The sets shown are expected to be extremely expensive compared to normal flat TVs.

For instance, the Samsung's 55-inch curved TV costs around £7,000 compared to around £2,000 for its flat screen equivalent.

Some experts claim the effect is ruined if you aren't sitting in the right spot and so isn't ideal for family viewing.

They claim it may be better suited to smaller devices, used by one person at a time - tablets or phones, for instance.

However, many experts who have seen the sets disagree.

'It’s an interesting idea, but its solving a problem that doesn’t need to be solved,’ said Stuart Miles of gadget site Pocket Lint.

‘As a piece of technology it’s mind boggling.

‘However, I’m yet to see the benefit of a curved TV - it still seems like a little bit of showboating.’

Others claim the effect is ruined if you aren’t sitting in the right spot.

‘Curved TVs work well if you're sat in the sweetspot for watching TV, making for a more immersive experience, but if you're off-axis then you lose the benefit of the curve - not ideal for family viewing,’ said Joe Cox of What Hi.

‘So it might be better suited to smaller devices, used by one person at a time - tablets or phones, for instance.’

The sets shown are expected to be extremely expensive compared to normal flat TVs.

For instance, the Samsung's 55-inch curved TV costs around £7,000 compared to around £2,000 for its flat screen equivalent.

Even Panasonic’s US boss Joseph Taylor admitted this, admitting his firms giant curved screens were ‘a business solution unless you’re the head of a hedge fund.’

Samsung showcased their line of curved Ultra HD televisions at CES with runs through Friday. The TV firms say the sets make for a more cinema-like experience
