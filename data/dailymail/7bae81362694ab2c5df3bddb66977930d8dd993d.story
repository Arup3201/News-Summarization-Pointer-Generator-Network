It is a friendship that wouldn't be out of place in a children's book.

Fugly the pug and KFC the chick won't leave each other's sides, after they struck up an unlikely companionship.

The fluffy yellow chick and brown-haired puppy can often be spotted doing their favourite activities together - cuddling, sleeping and with KFC tucked under Fugly's paws.

Fugly's owner Tim Ho took the cute pictures and said he and his neighbour had bought the animals as pets around the same time.

They decided to introduce them to each other to see what would happen - and to their surprise KFC and Fugly bonded almost immediately.

Tim said: 'As soon as they were let loose, KFC would follow Fugly everywhere.

Friends: KFC seems to look inquisitively at Fugly. The chick can be spotted following the pug around

Cosy: Fugly playfully rests his head on top of KFC the chick, with the two comforable in each other's space

'Fugly was a bit apprehensive at first but he wasn't territorial or fierce so we allowed it to continue.

'We didn't need to encourage them to interact, every time Fugly slept or sat down, KFC would crawl underneath his tummy, his favourite resting place.'

Tim added his thinks the fact the 15-month-old pub wasn't yet territorial over his new home made it easier for him to accept KFC and for the couple to develop their blossoming friendship.

On the lookout: Tim Ho, the owner of Fugly the pug, took the series of adorable pictures

Protective: Fugly protectively covers KFC with his head while the chick looks on
