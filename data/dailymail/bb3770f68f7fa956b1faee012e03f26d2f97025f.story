The teenage college student cut off by her parents when they found out she was gay has revealed that they thought ‘she had a mental disease’.

Kate Koenig, 19, said her 'homophobic' parents refused to pay for her classes at the University of Pittsburgh after her father opened her mail last year and learned about her sexuality.

She resorted to asking for $15 000 in donations to pay for college via a GoFundMe page.

Plea: Kate Koenig, 19, has launched a fundraising campaign online to help her fund her degree at the University of Pittsburgh after her 'homophobic' parents found out she was gay when they opened her mail

Ms Koenig spoke exclusively to MailOnline about how her parents treated her because of her sexuality and the backlash she suffered from the public after news broke of her fundraising campaign.

'They said I had a mental disease,' she said. 'They said my sexuality was a mental disease and I needed medication for it. They said I’m a sick person for being gay.

'My parents said I was just looking for attention, I’m obviously a very sick person who needs help and medication can solve that for me.'

Her parents’ discovery, and the family blowout that followed, happened in September 2013, just before Koenig started college at the University of Pittsburgh.

She said: 'My mom sat me down and asked me how I became gay. She asked if it was because she started working full time again and wasn’t home as much, or if it was because someone hurt me.'

Koenig’s parents also discovered her boyfriend was transgender and had been born female. 

She said: 'My mother asked, "Do you want a penis now? If you’re dating this transsexual, transgender man, do you want to be a man too?"

'Then they wrote me a letter to tell me I was cut off and to shame me for my personality and my sexuality.

'In the letter, they also said they’d found a few psychologists for me and asked me to get therapy and take medication, to cure myself, before they would let me back into the house. They wanted me to switch off my sexuality.

'They said the fact that I used social media and took selfies was indicative of a very narcissistic person. They said social media fuels the gay agenda. It ruins our society and promotes homosexuality and they asked me to delete my social media accounts.

'And my dad said he felt sorry for people in the LGBT+ community. "They are living a morally corrupt life, they are making this society crumble. They are going to hell."'

Loved: Koenig is pictured with her transgender boyfriend Will, who was born biologically as a woman

Together: She dismissed claims that dating Will meant she was straight, saying: 'I am still gay. Being in a "straight" relationship does not take away my sexuality'. The couple have been together over a year

 Koenig identifies as pansexual, but also describes herself as ‘gay’, saying: 'To me, gay is the umbrella for the entire LGBT+ community.'

Koenig’s parents had already paid for the first semester and co-signed a loan with her for the second semester, but they refused to co-sign any more loans.

She asked for $15,000 for her second year’s tuition on her GoFundMe page, which she set up last week. She has already raised almost $12,000, but also received an enormous negative backlash after news of her campaign broke last week.

'People are commenting really disgusting things like ‘die homo b****’, "why don’t you just go to stripper school or do porn?", "suck my d*** and I’ll send you money". I’m afraid I’ll start getting death threats.'

Struggle: Recently, she shared a document showing she had been fired from Costco because the company had overhired. She lamented that it was her main source of income to supplement her loans

Support: Koenig is pictured with Will and his family who have given their support to Kate and her campaign

Koenig says the comments are 'because I’m gay, I’m young, and I’m a woman.'  

'I’m being attacked for needing a handout and being lazy. But there are so many people who do this. People have GoFundMes for home improvement or sending their kids on vacation. Some guy got thousands of dollars on Kickstarter for making a potato salad.

'I just feel really harassed right now,' she added.

But Koenig is adamant that it’s not about being gay.

She continued: 'I’m not asking for money because I’m gay. I happen to be gay, but that’s not my full story. My sexuality is only relevant because that’s the reason I got kicked out.

'I’m just trying to go to school. Pittsburgh is the first time in my life I’ve felt truly safe and accepted for who I am.'
