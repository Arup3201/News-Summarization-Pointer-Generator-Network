JonBenet Ramsey's father doesn't want secret grand jury indictments from his daughter's case released to the public.

John Ramsey's attorneys sent a letter Monday to the Boulder County District Attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire grand jury record would only defame the former beauty queen's parents.

Only six-years-old at the time of her death, JonBenet Ramsey was found dead in the basement of her family's home Christmas Day in 1996 after the girl's mother called 911 saying a ransom note had been left.

Reports earlier this year suggested the secret indictments were of both John and Patricia Ramsey, the deceased girl's mother.

John Ramsey's attorneys argued Monday that to release only the indictments, and not the entire grand jury record, would put him at a disadvantage.

'Public release of the allegations of an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame (John Ramsey) and his late wife Patricia,' the letter said, according to the Daily Camera.

'Mr. Ramsey will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those allegations in a court of law,' the letter continued.

'Nor will the public have any ability to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury record is unsealed and opened to public view,' said the letter.

The move to make the indictments public is an effort between the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and a Boulder Daily Camera reporter.

The indictments were earlier this year reported to be of child abuse leading to their daughter's death, according to the paper.

A grand jury voted at the time to go forward with the charges, but the district attorney declined to go forward with the charges over the fear he could not prove guilty without a reasonable doubt, according to the paper.

Sent on John Ramsey's behalf, the letter was in response to a judge ruling last week that releasing the indictments would not be in violation of grand jury secrecy rules, the paper said.

That judge ordered the current DA to provide reason why it should be kept secret, according to the Daily Camera, to which the said he would provide them to a judge to determine if they would be released.

John Ramsey's attorneys argued against this move, saying he was never contacted about the release of any documents from his daughter's case - adding that without releasing the entire record, the objective will not be achieved.

'The District Court found 'transparency' to be the determinative factor in its order to show cause,' said the letter. 'Transparency can only be accomplished if the entire record is made public.'

'The court should also order release of the entire grand jury record, including all witness testimony, all exhibits, all colloquy discussions between prosecutors and the grand jury and all drafts of potential indictments presented by the prosecutors of the grand jury,' the letter continues.

Officials responded to the letter by stating they only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired, according to the paper.

The Ramseys were exonerated in 2008 from any responsibility for the girl's death by the then-DA.

The statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002.
