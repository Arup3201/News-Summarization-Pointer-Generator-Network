Jak Alnwick is 'very lucky' to have Alan Pardew as a manager, insists Newcastle United goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman.

Alnwick will face Arsenal before making his first start at St James' Park in the Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland on December 21, and is being backed to win a new contract with Newcastle not allowed to bring in a replacement goalkeeper on an emergency loan.

The Magpies remain without senior goalkeepers Tim Krul and Rob Elliot until January due to injury, and Woodman has hailed Pardew for giving the 21-year-old a chance to prove himself.

'Jak's an incredibly mature young man. You wouldn't think he's just 21 talking to him or indeed watching him play out there,' Woodman said.

'I wouldn't have any worries about Jak because there is this calmness and assurance about him, and I think against Chelsea his team-mates saw that and it gave them confidence.

'He's like a lot of young English players, bags of talent and good character but it's all about getting the chance and as a goalkeeper, it's even harder to be given that chance.

'We're very lucky here at Newcastle to have a manager who plays young footballers. In circumstances you do not always want, like [against Chelsea] with Rob having to come off, Jak has done his own prospects no harm at all.'
