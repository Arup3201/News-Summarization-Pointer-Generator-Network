Uefa has charged Montenegro after their Euro 2016 qualifier in Podgorica was abandoned following Russia players being hit by missiles.

The Montenegro Football Association (FSCG) has been charged with holding a match that did not get played in full, and for fans throwing fireworks and missiles. The Russian football union (RFS) has also been charged for the setting off/throwing of fireworks and objects by their spectators.

Russia have lodged a formal complaint with UEFA and demanded they be awarded a victory after the abandoned match on Friday.

The match in Podgorica was abandoned after 67 minutes with the score still at 0-0 after Russia's Dmitri Kombarov was hit by an object, which led to a melee between the players.

The game had already been suspended once, in the first minute when the Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was struck on the head by a flare and was taken to hospital for treatment for burns.

Play resumed after a 33-minute delay and the start of the second half was also delayed by 18 minutes due to further disturbances. The eventual abandonment came shortly after Russia's Roman Shirokov had a penalty saved by Vukasin Poleksic.

'Proceedings have also been opened against the Football Union of Russia (RFS) for the setting off/throwing of fireworks and objects by their spectators.

'A protest has also been filed by the RFS and disciplinary proceedings have been opened.'
