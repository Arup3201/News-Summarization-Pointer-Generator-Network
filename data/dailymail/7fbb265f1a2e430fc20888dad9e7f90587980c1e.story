Just one year after the Las Vegas mansion of Liberace was purchased for just $500,00 out of foreclosure, the flamboyant pianist's massive estate has been restored to its former glory.

British businessman Martyn Ravenhill put in $1million after buying the property in August 2013, and has brought back the opulence and grandeur the massive 14,939-square-foot home was once known for.

And he is just getting started.

Ravenhill purchased the 14,939-square-foot home for $500,000 out of foreclosure in August 2013

Among the work he has had done is a ceiling mural in the master bedroom and bathroom

'Liberace, to me, is like the face of Las Vegas. Liberace brought magic to the stage,' said Ravenhill

“I saw that it was for sale and that it was in really bad shape,” Ravenhill told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

'I called and was told that it already had an offer and was not for sale. I asked "Who bid on it — a person or a company? Is it officially sold?"' 

That is when he decided to buy the estate, paying in cash.

'I did not realize the magnitude of the place until I saw it. It is almost 15,000 square feet. In England, you can purchase a studio flat for about $500,000, and here I could get a 15,000-square-foot home owned by Liberace for the same amount,' he said.

Now, Liberace's home has come back to life once again.

The mural is supposed to resemble that of the famed Sistine Chapel in the Vatican

'I did not realize the magnitude of the place until I saw it. It is almost 15,000 square feet,' said Ravenhill

'In England, you can purchase a studio flat for about $500,000, and here I could get a 15,000-square-foot home owned by Liberace for the same amount,' he added

The house is filled with 18 chandeliers, something that Liberace was famously fond of

'Upon entering its ornate doors is the grand staircase that was reportedly imported from France,' says the paper as they describe the interior of the estate.

'The home features 18 chandeliers, some original to the home. There are eight marble pillars and multiple stained-glass windows. Images of Liberace and musical notes are incorporated throughout.' 

There are also lots of mirrors, and even a ceiling mural in the master bedroom and bath.

'I grew up believing that Las Vegas is the place of dreams and magic. The house has that glitz and a magical feeling to it,' said Ravenhill

'When you take a look at Liberace, he was a very different type of entertainer, and there is no one to compare. He had a personal touch, and I think that he had that little spark, that glitz and that glamour like no one else,' Ravenhill said

Ravenhill is not set to begin his next project of restoring parts of the grand estate 

'When you take a look at Liberace, he was a very different type of entertainer, and there is no one to compare. He had a personal touch, and I think that he had that little spark, that glitz and that glamour like no one else,' Ravenhill said.

'Liberace, to me, is like the face of Las Vegas. Liberace brought magic to the stage, and I grew up believing that Las Vegas is the place of dreams and magic. The house has that glitz and a magical feeling to it.'
