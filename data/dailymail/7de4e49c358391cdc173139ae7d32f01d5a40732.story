Ukip candidate Lynton Yates (pictured) has been suspended after saying the jobless shouldn't drive

A Ukip General Election candidate has been suspended after he said benefits claimants should be banned from driving to cut traffic - and take the bus to job interviews instead.

The policy, which was swiftly disowned by the party, was in a flyer boasting 'common sense solutions'  sent out by a 64-year-old county councillor in Leicestershire.

Lynton Yates claimed it would remove 6million cars from the roads - adding he'd cut traffic further by forcing cyclists back onto the pavement.

The leaflet faced widespread scorn within minutes of appearing on Twitter and has prompted an investigation by party bosses.

Mr Yates has now been suspended from his post as Ukip's General Election candidate for the seat of Charnwood.

A party spokesman said: 'Lynton Yates' views do not represent Ukip policy. He has apologised for any offence caused and was today suspended as a candidate.'

The spokesman would not confirm whether the suspension was temporary or permanent. He remained a member of the party and a councillor today.

The leaflet boasted: 'We could likely remove six million cars from the road if benefit claimants were not driving.

'Why do they have the privilege to spend the taxpayers' hard-earned money on a car, when those in work are struggling to keep their own car on the road?

'These people could really catch a bus!

'Yet again we're proposing common sense policies and common sense solutions'.

His leaflet added: 'As much as I applaud cycling as a form of exercise and past-time [sic] the already congested roads cannot cope with both bus lanes AND cyclists.

'Cycles should go back to the pavements yet give priority to pedestrians.' 

Former Conservative Mr Yates became a Leicestershire councillor in 1989 and now serves on the council's transport committee.

He was due to fight the Leicestershire seat of Charnwood at the general election in May - where the current MP is former Tory minister Stephen Dorrell, who has been in the Commons since 1979.

Mr Dorrell is standing down as an MP to become a health policy adviser for accountants KPMG.

Shadow health minister Jamie Reed said the Eurosceptic party was now 'beyond a joke'.

Labour MP Mr Reed said: 'It's beyond a joke now. Not so much a political party but a stag night out of control.'

The councillor raised a similar issue during a meeting last month in which he tried to stop cycle lanes being built.

'You're like lemmings when it comes to what central government tells you,' he said. 'They can be wrong. Major got it wrong telling cyclists to come off the payment.'

But his comments were disowned today by his only Ukip colleague in Leicestershire David Sprason, who tweeted: 'The views expressed by Lynton Yates are his own and do not reflect my or Ukip's policy'.

Elsewhere in the leaflet Mr Yates said he personally believed rapists and child sex offenders should be chemically castrated.

He also said he believed all prisoners should have their possessions confiscated and sent to serve their sentences abroad - though how this would save money was unclear.

'Prisoners cost the taxpayer upwards of £45,000 per annum EACH,' he wrote.

'Any assets of convicted criminals, for example homes, cars, savings, etc, should be confiscated to help pay for their sentence.

'I personally would look to overseas countries who could tender for their incarceration. I'm sure they could dramatically reduce this cost to the taxpayer.'

His Labour opponent for the Charnwood seat, Sean Kelly-Walsh, said: 'It is a sad indictment of a political party that is aiming to have a say in how this country is governed that he should state something so inane, not thought through, and frankly depressing in its vindictive simplicity.'

But Max Hunt, the Labour group leader on Leicestershire County Council, claimed Mr Yates had previously suggested cutting back bus funding because many passengers were benefits claimants.

'He's not mad', said Mr Hunt. 'There are a lot of people who say things like that in bar rooms. Plenty of people think like that and they're Ukip supporters.'

When asked if he agreed with the leaflet, Mr Hunt said: 'Of course not'.

A Ukip spokesman said last night the suggestions were 'not Ukip policies and they will not form part of the Ukip manifesto.'

Gaffes: Party leader Nigel Farage has had to deal with a series of out-of-turn comments by his own members. He personally suggested immigrants might be to blame for congestion on the M4

This morning the councillor remained in the party and in his county council job.

The party's spokesman told MailOnline: 'There's no doubt he's been a bit of an idiot but it's of a different value to racism or things of that sort.

'We can't chuck somebody out even for abject racism in 24 hours. We have to go through due process.

'There will be discussions made and decisions taken as with anything but he is still a member of the party'.

Mr Yates did not return requests for comment. 

This week Ukip was forced to deny claims its policy chief had been sacked amid fears the party's General Election manifesto would not be ready in time for the spring conference in March.

Tim Aker left his post with just months to go before the biggest campaign in the party's history, but Ukip candidates still have little they are able to say on the doorstep.

That led Twitter users to fill the gap by suggesting their own Ukip policies - including a price cut for mustard-coloured corduroy trousers and renaming Britain 'Bongo Bongo Land'.

Many of the supposed policies referenced Ukip's string of gaffes.

One councillor said last winter's floods were God's punishment for the legalisation of gay marriage, while party leader Nigel Farage appeared to blame immigrants for congestion on the M4.
