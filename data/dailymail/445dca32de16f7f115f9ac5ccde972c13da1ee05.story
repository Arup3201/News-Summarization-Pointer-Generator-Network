Ashley Young has urged his Manchester United team-mates to forget moaning about the chaotic festive fixture period and keep going the club's momentum.

Boss Louis van Gaal has spoken about his belief that too many games are played over Christmas and the turn of the New Year, but Young insisted that it is the very time for United to leave their rivals trailing.

Confidence appears to be rising under Van Gaal after strong recent results, which have left the club fourth in the Premier League. And Young wants United to make the most of their seven games in the next month by catching up with the three teams above them - Southampton, Manchester City and leaders Chelsea - starting with a win against Stoke at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

'This has always been when United teams come strong and get points on the board,' the 29-year-old winger told ManUtd.com. 'You look further up the table rather than looking around you. We hope to come strong after the Christmas period and that can only set us up for the rest of the season.

'It's a time when you play a game, have a cool down day afterwards and then you are back playing again. But that is what every player wants to do. You want to go out there and play matches and win.

'We have got some big games coming up and everybody wants to play. If you saw our training sessions, you would see that everybody wants to be in the team and playing.'

Van Gaal has taken charge of just 13 competitive matches during his first four months in charge at United, but is now on a tough run of nine games in 36 days.

United are currently four points adrift of third-placed Southampton, five behind Manchester City and 11 back from Chelsea.

‘I’m not happy but I cannot change it,’ Van Gaal said. ‘I don’t agree with it because I don’t think that it is good for the players that they play another match within two days. In December, it shall be like that.

‘We also have families. I also have a wife and kids and grandchildren and I cannot see them this Christmas.

'But I want to work in the Premier League, I have to adapt and I shall adapt. But I don’t think it is good for players, neither for the families.’

Meanwhile, United midfielder Michael Carrick has backed Robin van Persie to get back to his best as the fear factor slowly returns to Old Trafford.

United produced their most convincing display of the season as they overpowered Hull 3-0 in a one-sided contest on Saturday in which Van Persie responded to his critics with a fine goal.

Van Persie's form has been indifferent this season and a week before scoring against Hull the Dutchman was heavily criticised for an awful and ineffectual display at Arsenal.

'We all get criticised at certain times and it's something you have to deal with,' said Carrick. 'The best way to answer it is the way he did it against Hull.

'Robin scored a great goal and hopefully that will be the start of a good run over the weeks to come.'
