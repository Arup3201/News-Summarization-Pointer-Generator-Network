At least 36 people were killed and 30 more injured after a stampede in an Indian town where millions of Hindus had gathered for a religious festival.

Twenty-seven of the dead were women, mostly elderly and poor, while an eight-year-old girl was also crushed to death as massive crowds flooded a train station in the northern town of Allahabad on Sunday evening.

One woman was seen weeping at the train station, surrounded by six bodies dressed in brightly coloured saris.

Officials gave contradictory versions of what caused the crush. A railway official said police had been using batons to control the crowd, triggering panic.

A state government official said a footbridge handrail collapsed, sending people slipping down the stairs and starting a stampede.

An eyewitness told NDTV news channel: 'There was complete chaos. There was no doctor or ambulance for at least two hours after the accident.'

Millions of devoted Hindus had earlier been pictured queuing patiently as they prepared to cleanse their sins during the world's largest religious festival.

Pilgrims plunged into the sacred River Ganges as they took part in  the Kumbh Mela  - considered the holiest of the 55-day festival - in northern India.

The festival, held every 12 years, is expected to attract more than 100 million visitors from all over the world over a month with 30million in one day alone.

Among them was Malti Devi, 65, from London.

'One dip in the river has the power to change life forever,' said Ms Devi who was taking part for the first time.

She told the Economic Times, India's leading business paper that she would donate food and clothes to the poor after taking the ritual dip.

She said: 'I'm not worried about the security or
pollution. We're here to celebrate a festival that brings the rich and 
poor together.'

The festival is being held in Allahabad 
in northern Uttar Pradesh state, with smaller events every three years 
in other parts of the country.

Around 7,000 police and 30,000 volunteers were recruited to control the crowds on the day, and some 10 million women alone were expected to bathe in the Ganges.

Pilgrims believe that  the river cleanses them of sin and frees them of the cycle of birth and rebirth. Many believe some three billion Hindu deities will also take a dip in the sacred river to bless mankind.

The Times reported that the festival, welcomed naked ash-smeared mystics, known as sadhus, and swamis and gurus clad in flowing robes streamed into the festival grounds.

Eight million people who are living in a sprawling city of tents have already bathed at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers since the festival began.
