Tottenham captain Younes Kaboul was scathing in his assessment of Sunday's 2-1 defeat by Newcastle at White Hart Lane on Sunday.

The French centre half said Mauricio Pochettino's squad lacked 'personality' and admitted they looked beaten when the visitors levelled.

'After the equaliser we looked defeated on the pitch,' Kaboul said. 'Newcastle saw that and they thought, "Yeah, why not? We’re going to win this game". And they did it.

'Do we need more personality in the squad? Maybe, yes.'

Spurs led 1-0 at half-time through Emmanuel Adebayor but then conceded through Sammy Ameobi just six seconds in to the second half.

Just before Newcastle kicked off the second period, Eric Dier sauntered back on to the pitch and high-fived his captain before dawdling back into the right-back position.

Seconds later he was watching Ameobi hare past him to score. 

'At the start of the second half it was blackout,' Kaboul added. 'We came back on to the pitch not thinking, missed the pass and Sammy Ameobi went through and scored.'

'We have to be braver and more focused. At this level there is no mercy. If you’re not focused, brave and ready, you pay the price. We should not concede goals like that.'

Ayoze Perez went on to score the winner for Newcastle to lift them out of the relegation zone and leave Spurs languishing in 11th.
