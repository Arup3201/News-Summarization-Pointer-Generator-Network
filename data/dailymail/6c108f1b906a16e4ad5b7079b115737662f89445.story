The National Television Award on Wednesday were a glittering spectacle of all the greatest TV talent in the UK and I was privileged to be a guest of OK! magazine at the 02 Arena to see Ant and Dec walk away with the best presenter award for the 13th year running.

The red-carpet at London’s O2 was possibly the busiest I’ve ever seen – it was crammed full of TV celebrities and literally hundreds of journalists of every description, TV, radio, magazines, newspapers, online were crammed behind the barriers and also my Made In Chelsea colleague Jamie Laing, who was pulling in a shift for Yahoo OMG!

Jamie  - who my father calls 'Jamie Biscuits' because he’s heir to the McVitie’s  Digestive’s fortune - interviewed me on the carpet and I have to say he was very good. At first he put me at ease with his usual bonhomie and friendly patter and then hit me with some really tough questions.

Spencer says Jamie got him to reveal too much in interview (left) on the red carpet where he also bumped into another fellow MIC star Cheska Hull (right)

Jamie cheekily awarded more than one star his 'Fittest Girl' award at the NTAs including I'm a Celebrity star Amy Willerton (left) and TOWIE cast member Jessica Wright (left)

He probably got me to reveal far too much and from what I heard was also equally charming with the ladies. He totally disarmed I’m A Celebrity star Amy Willerton by presenting her with his 'Fittest Girl at the NTAs Award 2014' award on the night.

The award did lose a little bit of its sparkle however when Amy bumped into TOWIE star Jess Wright in the OK! Magazine suite and found that Jess also had won the Fittest award, and then they both discovered that pretty much every other gorgeous girl in a frock who had walked past him had won the award. By my reckoning he had probably given out about ten 'fittest girl' awards on the night.

Just a quick tip here Jamie - if you are going to hedge your bets at a party by telling a few women that they are the best looking then you’d better be sure they aren’t going to be able to compare notes during the evening

That can tend to back-fire a bit.

Spencer admits his tux was feeling a bit tight at the awards last night

Here’s just a few quick tips on how to do the classic black tie.

Don’t EVER do clip on bow ties, always do up your own tie.

Do wear Prince Albert slippers – and if you do opt for slippers don’t wear socks.

Also the tuxedo test is always a good indicator if you have put on weight – it’s a suit that you only wear about three or four times a year and if it’s feeling a bit tight around the tummy then you know it’s time to take trip to the gym.

After my extended holiday in St Barths mine was feeling a little bit tighter than I’d hoped so I will be looking to book myself into No 1 Boot Camp fairly soon for a bit of a refresher course.

My holiday in St Barths was quite eventful after the New Year’s Eve celebrations and I was chuffed to receive a Facebook message from a not-so-old friend of mine, the totally stunning model Emma Miller.

She was staying on the nearby island of Anguilla and remembered that my family own a hotel on St Barths and so thought it was a safe bet that I might be there.

I’ve known Emma for a few years, and we met when I was promoting nightclubs in London. It was great to hear from her and it would have been rude not to agree to show her round Barts for a few days. 

Just friends: Spencer and Emma first sparked romance rumours with this Instagram picture last week

Spencer says that both being on holiday with friends made for a fun break

She was on holiday with a friend, as was I, so we made a very entertaining foursome to go out to the beaches and for dinners.

Now I realise that given my previous history some DM readers may find this hard to believe but we were only 'just good friends'.

Emma is an utterly lovely girl and I hope that I see her again soon, but sadly our little holiday has now run out and she left to do a big modeling job in New York and I’m back filming for Made In Chelsea.

All the best, Spencer xxx
