You religiously tot up the calories in the food you eat, but still find you can’t shift the pounds? It could be down not to what you are eating, but drinking. 

Surveys by drinks charities and the Royal Society of Health (RSPH) have shown that up to 75 per cent of Britons are unaware how many calories are contained in their favourite tipple, and that calorie overload through alcohol is occurring at an alarming rate.

As a result, pressure is mounting on drinks companies to provide more information on labels - including the amount of calories alcoholic beverages contain. 

Mindless drinking: New research reveals that 75 per cent of Brits are unaware how many calories are contained in their favourite tipple - a large glass of wine is equivalent to a digestive biscuit 

The RSPH is among those calling on the EU health commissioner to introduce stricter guidelines on what consumers must be told about the energy content of drinks.

'There is a clear appetite for this information,' said Shirley Cramer, chief executive of RSPH. 'It could make a major difference to the waistlines of the nation.'

Guidelines in the UK recommend men drink no more than four units a day and women no more than three, with two alcohol-free days per week. 

Exceeding these limits can not only raise the risk of heart disease, strokes and diabetes, it can also lead to weight gain in the places you least want it - around the waistline and on the hips. 

Will you regret it in the morning? Even sticking to the recommended 2-3 units a day could see you consume up to 6,000 calories per month, representing a weight gain of almost two pounds

Katherine Brown, Director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies says weight gain is one of the most instant effects of regular high alcohol consumption: a large glass of wine (250ml) can add 228 calories to your evening meal, the equivalent of a Cornetto ice cream or two fish fingers.

A standard glass of red or white wine (175ml) could also contain up to 160 calories, which is similar to a slice of Madeira cake. 

Even sticking to the recommended 2-3 units a day could see you consume up to 6,000 calories per month, representing a weight gain of almost two pounds. 

Weigh it up: A bellini, which is a mixture of Prosecco sparkling wine and peach purée or nectar, contains 158 calories per glass, which is equivalent to a small plain croissant

In 12 months that equates to a stone and a half of added bulk.Indeed, it’s hardly surprising that Carol Vorderman recently claimed to have shed weight after ditching booze for a year. 

Brown says a lot of women simply don’t realise that, by sharing a bottle of wine in the evening, they are consuming the calorie equivalent of an indulgent portion of cheesecake. 

'Women often see alcohol calories differently to those in food,' she says. 'They are not; they are one and the same.'
