A New Hampshire man has been accused of putting the two-year-old son of his girlfriend in a clothes dryer and turning it on, seriously burning the boy.

According to a police affidavit, Adam Morton, 27, admitted to investigators that he lowered the child into the dryer in early August, leaving the child with second degree burns on his back, arms and feet.

Morton was left in charge of the boy by his partner and claims that even though he did put the boy inside the dryer, he did so for only one revolution of the drum.

Accused: According to police in Maine, Adam Morton (pictured) has admitted to putting a two-year-old boy (not in the above photo) in a dryer while babysitting for his girlfriend 

However, according to WCSH6, the police affidavit contains the evidence of Dr. Lawrence Ricci, who conducted his own forensic examination of the boy.

He concluded 'there were lesions on the lower back that looked like they could have been healing burns and incidentally, the two circular lesions correspond to bolts on the inside of the dryer.

Ricci also said that 'the distribution of the burns indicates either that the child was moving fairly dramatically and or the dryer was moving.'

In conclusion, Dr. Ricci said that the boy was inside the dryer for a 'fairly prolonged period of time. And the dryer, indeed, may have actaully been turning.'

Cruelty: While it is not clear why he did so, Morton has allegedly admitted to police that he put the two-year-old in the dryer

As part of their ongoing investigation, police took the dryer from the mother's Maine home and tested to see how hot the drum got when it was on.

They put the machine on for five minutes at the 'low' setting and the dryer hit 125 degrees.

However, when it was put on 'normal' for three minues the temperatrue hit 180 degrees.

Morton was staying with his girlfriend and her three other children when the incident occurred.

According to WSCH6, when representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services arrived to interview the other children, the were told by them that Morton 'does mean things' to the boy.

Morton is currently facing a charge of aggravated assault and is currently in custody on $2,500 cash bail.
