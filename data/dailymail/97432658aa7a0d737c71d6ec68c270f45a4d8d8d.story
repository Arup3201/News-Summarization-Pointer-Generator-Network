A Kazakh socialite, with alleged ties to the mob, has been accused of stealing her ex-husband's $20million New York apartment and blowing $75million of his fortune on jewelry.

Maria Nazarbayeva, 51, is accused of secretly listing herself as co-owner of the plaza property before selling it on to her son for a token $1.

Lawyers representing fertiliser tycoon Bolat Nazarbayev, brother of Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev, say she also wired $75 million to celebrity jewelers Jacob the Jeweler.

Papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, state Nazarbayeva 'purchased a very large quantity of jewelry from Jacob & Co., for a total value of about $75 million, all of which we believe was purchased with Nazarbayev’s money', the New York Daily News reports.

Nazarbayeva, who denies any wrongdoing, was portrayed to the court by her former assistant Saule Arykbayeva as a criminal with links to the underworld and a fearsome reputation for making her enemies go 'missing'.

Ms Arykbayeva who testified on Mr Nazarbayev's behalf, asked not to give her address and the names of her children to the court because she was concerned for their safety.

'Knowing what kind of person she is, I’m not only fearful for my life but fearful for the lives of my children,' she said.

One story, which surfaced in her native Khazaksthan alleges that Nazarbayeva had made a love rival disappear 'without a trace'.

The woman was found two weeks later, but the only explanation she would give was that she had got 'lost in the mountains'.

Another
of her alleged victims, Kazakhstani businessman Edgar Salduzi, vanished
from his home, following reports of a dispute with Nazarbaeva.

Salduzi,
who according to the court papers had filed a successful lawsuit 
against Nazarbaeva, was allegedly held captive for 45 days before 
managing to escape.

Ms Arykbayeva claimed to have heard an audio recording of Nazarbaeva ordering her associates to 'kidnap him and get rid of him'.

However
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten said the criminal 
allegations were 'hearsay' - and later ordered Miss Arykbayeva to reveal
the details of her children and her address saying Nazarbayeva probably
knew where she lived anyway.

The
extraordinary feud between the Nazarbayevs reportedly has its roots in 
their 2001 marriage when Mr Nazarbayev claims his wife used an alias as 
she was still married to somebody else at the time.

They reportedly divorced in 2009 with Mr Nazarbayev also being granted an annulment last year.

Last
year it emerged he was suing her claiming she was trying to steal the 
4,000-square-foot apartment looking out over Central Park.

He
said he had approved the purchase in 2008 so his family would have a 
place to stay in New York, but had opnly discovered Nazarbayeva had 
listed herself as a co-owner after he had their marriage annulled in 
2011.

The lawsuit alleges she subsequently sold it to her son Daniyar for $1.

Later
in 2012 he filed for immediate custody of their 10-year-old son 
Khanbolat claiming she was both a bad parent and a wanted criminal.

He accused her of swanning off on holiday to Dubai and leaving the boy in the care of a babysitter.

At the time Nazarbayeva was on the Interpol wanted list on kidnapping and extortion charges from her homeland and was reportedly arrested in Dubai.

She hit back describing her ex-husband as being 'no angel' himself  - and their divorce papers show he was married to two other women at the time.

His brother Nursultan Nazarbayev has been in power in Kazakhstan has been in power for the last 22 years. At the last election he won 91 per cent of the vote.
