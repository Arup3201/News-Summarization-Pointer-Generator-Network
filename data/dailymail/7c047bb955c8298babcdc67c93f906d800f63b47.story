Florida State footballer Nick O'Leary miraculously managed to walk away virtually unscathed from a horrific motorcycle crash.

Not only was O'Leary lucky to be alive but he somehow only sustained minor injuries when his motorcycle entered into a violent collision with a Lexus.

This dramatic footage from a nearby bus shows the moment that O'Leary's motorcycle collided with the front of the Lexus and disintegrated.

O'Leary was sent flying for 75-100 feet, narrowly avoiding crashing into the bus.

Unbelievably he can be seen standing up and walking away from the accident.

O'Leary was transported to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital afterwards but was only treated for non-life threatening injuries after the crash on May 2.

Debris from the broken motorcycle went flying in every direction next to the bus

While the motorcycle was disintegrating, O'Leary was sliding for around 100 feet round the other side of the bus

The Lexus was criticised for pulling out in front of O'Leary's bike.

According to FOX Sports Florida, O'Leary's coach Jimbo Fisher said that he was 'banged up for about a month'.

Oâ€™Leary is the grandson of legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus.
