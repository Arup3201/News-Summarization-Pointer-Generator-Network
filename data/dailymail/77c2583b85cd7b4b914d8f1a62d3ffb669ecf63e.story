Cleared: British multi-millionaire entrepreneur Gregory Cox (pictured at court this week) was today found not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman, 21

A British tycoon accused of forcing a woman to perform oral sex on him on Australia's Bondi Beach was today found not guilty.

Gregory Charles Cox, 32, faced two charges of sexual intercourse without consent with a 21-year-old tourist on the iconic beach in Sydney.

The holidaymaker from Bermuda claimed Cox had said: ‘You 
can tell the police, you can tell whoever you like but this will never 
go anywhere – I’ve got a lot of money.’

But after a trial that lasted three weeks at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court, the jury found him not guilty of the two charges today.

Crown Prosecutor Elizabeth Wilkins SC had
 told the court that the woman had kissed and exchanged phone 
numbers with Cox’s friend Christopher Galea.

The
 court heard that the 21-year-old woman also spoke to Cox, who founded 
his own financial services firm, about the English private school he 
went to while at beachfront bar The Bucket List in January 2012.

She claimed the pair then went to the beach after many hours drinking together when she
 remembers Cox sitting against a concrete wall while she had her back to
 the ocean.

In
 his opening address to the jury in May, prosecutor Huw Baker said: ‘She
 recalls being on her knees and she tried to stand up but being unable 
to stand up because something was holding her down,’ he said. ‘She 
recalls being terrified at that point.’

Cox is then said to have forced her to perform a sex act on him.

Afterwards she cried and hit Cox on the thighs as she told him: ‘Please stop, please stop – I don’t want this.’

Mr Baker said: ‘She was trying to get up but felt the accused’s hand on the back of her head.’

'Will go nowhere': The court heard that Cox (pictured leaving court) told the woman that 'you can tell the police, you can tell whoever you like but this will never go anywhere - I've got a lot of money'. A jury today cleared him of the charges

The court was told her cries for help were later heard 
by a young couple and she was taken to a police station, where officers 
described her as being ‘distressed, shivering and crying’.

Police were also said to have heard her say: ‘He told me over and over again that he had a lot of money.’

Cox, who founded the Manchester-based
 Quintessential Finance Group, was on holiday in Australia in January last year when he met the woman.

He had been staying in a luxury beach-side apartment in the suburb of Bronte, a few miles from Bondi.

The businessman, who lists Peaches 
Geldof among his Facebook friends, was arrested four days after the 
alleged incident when he returned to the bar and was spotted by staff 
who had been supplied with his description by police.

Met while holidaying: The woman, a holidaymaker from Bermuda, met Cox at The Bucket List bar in the Bondi Pavilion (pictured) on the beachfront where they talked about the English private school that Cox went to, the court heard

Graeme Turnbull, defending, told the 
Sydney court that the woman’s conduct ‘was entirely consistent with a 
willing participant’.

The jury heard that Cox had told friends the woman ‘freaked out’ after the sex act, threw her handbag in the air and ran off.

As she left her belongings on the 
beach, said Mr Turnbull, Cox had handed them in to a city centre police 
station, where he gave his own details.

Mr Turnbull also said that his client had gone back to the Bondi beach bar to ask if anyone knew the woman.

‘If he is a rapist, is that consistent?’ he asked the court. 

A jury found him not guilty of all the charges against him.

After hours of drinking: The woman claimed the incident happened on Bondi Beach, Sydney, which is visited by thousands of Britons every year
