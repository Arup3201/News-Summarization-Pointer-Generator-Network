Animal rescue workers have expressed their shock after seven little puppies were dumped by the side of the road. 

It is thought the litter of mongrel pups were abandoned in a laundry basket by their  breeder because they were not sold in time for Christmas.

The seven-week-old pups were left by the side of the busy country road with no food, or water, in freezing winter weather.

Seven little puppies have been handed into animal rescue workers after they were found next to a busy road

Kaye Mughal, Battersea Dogs & Cats Home Old Windsor centre manager, said: 'The puppies were found on the side of a country road in a bucket, so it's very obvious they were dumped deliberately.

'Given the timing we're worried they were bred as Christmas presents by someone looking to make a quick buck, but when they failed to sell they were disposed of.

'Dumping animals without food or water near a road could have disastrous consequences, but thankfully a member of the public acted quickly, and they're now recovering from their ordeal and are looking for new homes.'

The four brown and three black puppies were found by the side of a road in Chertsey, Surrey, last week and will be rehomed next year when they are old enough.

Carly Whyborn, Head of Operations at Battersea, said: 'Many of these puppies are being brought to Battersea for the right reasons, but others are cruelly dumped over Christmas.

'We pick up the pieces when people buy pets as presents.'
