A man was forcibly removed from a Spirit Airlines flight on Friday after he began screaming there was a bomb on the plane and that he was going to blow it up.

The incident happened on board a flight that had landed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Georgia, after flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The pilot had alerted police to meet the plane at the gate after the passenger had had outbursts throughout the entire flight and had started throwing items at fellow passengers.

The man refused to get up when two Atlanta police officers approached him after the plane had landed.

When the female officer leaned in to get him out of his seat he started screaming, ‘There's a bomb on the plane! If she takes me off, I'll blow the f****** plane up'.

Another passenger recorded the incident and posted the video on YouTube, according to WSBTV, which shows how the rest of the plane’s passengers remained calm throughout the whole ordeal.

The man was finally removed from the plane.Police concluded he was mentally ill or having some psychotic breakdown. He was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.

The pilot addressed the plane afterwards saying, ‘Folks, it will just be a few more minutes, please remain seated. We'll let you know. I appreciate everyone's cooperation.

'I want to sincerely apologize to everyone on board that airplane today for that,’ said the pilot, according to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.

Come with us, sir: The female officer speaks politely to the man asking him to get up

He refuses: The officer leans in to unbuckle his seat belt as he refuses to get up

Back-up: The second police officer comes up behind his colleague as the man yells, 'Don't f****** touch me'

'There's a bomb on this plane!' The man jumps out of his seat and starts screaming

'I'll blow it up!' The passenger yells to the rest of the people on the plane that he would blow up the plane if the police took him away

Gotcha: The police officers grab the man who won't stop his ranting tantrum

Calm and collected: The police remain polite and unfazed as they pick up the screaming man, who grabs a chair and his black backpack. He continues to claim he will blow up the plane

Not going down easily: The man grabs a hold of the seat and holds on for dear life as police manage to sedate him

Removed: The man is finally marched off the plane as passengers breathe a sigh of relief. They all remained seated and calm during the ordeal
