One of Britain’s most wanted fugitives has been arrested after fleeing to Cyprus.

John Anslow, 32, had been on the run since January 2012 – when he escaped from a prison van near HMP Hewell in Worcestershire.

He is charged with the murder of 27-year-old businessman Richard Deakin in Chasetown, Staffordshire, in July 2010.

Anslow, from Tipton, West Midlands, was arrested on Wednesday in Alancak, Northern Cyprus, for immigration offences and deported by the Turkish Cypriot authorities.

He was then arrested at Heathrow Airport yesterday morning and transferred to a high-security prison.

Anslow will appear via video link at Stafford Crown Court tomorrow over his failure to appear at court in January 2012.

Accused: John Anslow is charged with the murder of 27-year-old businessman Richard Deakin in July 2010

That month he was sprung from a prison 
van by a gang of masked men armed with knives and sledgehammers.

Anslow was en route to an appearance at Stafford Crown Court when the vehicle was ambushed by the three men.

Anslow, who faces a murder charge after a father-of-two was shot dead with a sawn-off shotgun as he lay in bed, was being driven to Stafford Crown Court when the vehicle was ambushed by three men at around 8.20am on 24 January.

The gang smashed the windscreen of the GEO Amey escort vehicle before punching the driver and threatening him with a knife.

They then escaped with then 31-year-old Anslow in a silver Volkswagen Scirocco,

The car was found dumped around ten miles from the scene of the ambush. It is believed the gang switched to a silver Mercedes.

The ambush took place on a narrow, secluded road in Tardebigge, just outside Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, shortly after the vehicle had left HMP Hewell Grange.

Anslow was one of five men charged with the murder of businessman Richard Deakin in Chasetown, Staffordshire, in July 2010.

Police said Mr Deakin's family have been updated about the latest development.

Anslow  was charged with murder on January 18 2012.

He became the first category A prisoner to escape in 17 years when he was broken out of the van last year.

It was originally thought he may have fled to Spain or North Africa.

Escape: The now 32-year-old has been at large for over a year
