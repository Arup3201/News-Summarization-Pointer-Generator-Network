This must surely be the ultimate tea break accessory for those with a sweet tooth - a 'dipper' mug designed to perfectly accommodate and dunk a biscuit.

Craig Kaplan, a 3D printing enthusiast, designed the Little Dipper to solve the problem of biscuits being too big to be fully submerged.

Originally marketed in America for kids who want to dunk biscuits in a small amount of milk before bed, they could also become a hit with tea lovers in Britain.

Each cup holds 100ml of fluid and is 
8.5 cm long - perfect for a McVitie's chocolate digestive - and features
 flared sides to allow the thumb and forefinger to be accommodated.

Mr
 Kaplan, an associate professor of Computer Science at the University of
 Waterloo in Canada, said: 'My kids love to dip their cookies in milk 
but the choice of cup poses a problem.

'A
 cup large enough for whole-biscuit dipping must be filled with a huge 
amount of milk, whereas a cup that holds the right amount of milk is 
usually too narrow for proper dipping.

'The
 sides of the cup are flared to allow thumb and forefinger to achieve 
dipping perfection, and the drink can be drunk afterwards from one of 
the narrow ends.'

After 
designing the cup it was created in ceramic by 3D printing service 
Shapeways, which is now selling the pale blue mug for $36.82 USD (Â£22).

Last month, MailOnline reported how new research suggested the humble Rich Tea biscuit was the most robust biscuit for dunking.

Of the five common biscuits studied, Rich Tea came out on top, with the Hobnob exposed as the least resilient dunker, becoming unstable after as few as three short dunks (approximately four seconds).

This is because it is an oat-based, rather than wheat-based biscuit and the larger oat particles in the Hobnob provide less structural strength.
