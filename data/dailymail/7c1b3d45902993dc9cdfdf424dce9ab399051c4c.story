The Doomsday Clock’s minute hand has been moved two minutes closer to midnight as experts warn we are closer than ever to a global catastrophe.

In a live international news conference, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) said that the threat of climate change and nuclear war posed a very serious threat to modern society.

Their symbolic clock is now set at three minutes to midnight, but while they say it is not too late to avert disaster ‘the window for action is closing rapidly’.

In an announcement today the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) has moved the minute hand of the symbolic Doomsday Clock forward by two minutes. It is now at three minutes to midnight, the closest it has been since 1984. The BAS moved the clock due to the threat of nuclear war and climate change

The conference took place at 4pm GMT (11am EST) today.

Key topics discussed included evidence of accelerating climate change and the increasing threat of nuclear war after failed promises from various international governments.

‘The danger is great but our message is not one of hopelessness,’ Kennette Benedict, executive director of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS), said in the announcement.

She said that there was still time to act, but real steps needed to be taken soon in order to ‘avert catastrophe.’

‘We find conditions to be so threatening that we are moving the hand two minutes closer. It is now three minutes to midnight,’ she continued.

Countries emitting carbon dioxide and other gases are transforming Earth’s climate in a dangerous way, she said, leaving millions vulnerable to rising sea levels, famines and 'killer storms.'

She also cited a failure by governments around the world to reduce their nuclear arsenal, in particular the US and Russia.

In total it is estimated 16,300 nuclear weapons remain in the world - and just 50 to 100 could produce massive casualties and long lasting effects on the atmosphere.

The BAS was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The physicists later set up the Clock in 1947 after their atomic bombs hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II (pictured)

‘Members of the BAS board are today imploring citizens of the world to speak clearly and demand leaders take necessary steps,’ Ms Benedict continued.

The BAS want to see action taken to cap greenhouse gases to 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and reduce spending on nuclear weapons.

‘We are not saying it is too late, but the window for action is closing rapidly,’ she added.

‘The world needs to awaken from its lethargy. Moving the clock hand inspires changes to help push the process along.’  

The BAS was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project.

The physicists set up the Doomsday Clock in 1947 after their atomic bombs hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.

Their Clock was created to convey threats to humanity and the planet. Midnight represents Doomsday, or when these threats will peak and cause a global catastrophe. 

The BAS also cited a failure by governments around the world to reduce their nuclear arsenal, in particular the US and Russia. In total it is estimated 16,300 nuclear weapons remain in the world - and just 50 to 100 could produce massive casualties and long lasting effects on the atmosphere (stock image shown)

Climate threats: The announcement not only warned of the threat of nuclear weapons, but also climate change as well. This graphic from last year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows observed examples of climate change worldwide

The decision to move the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock is made by the Bulletin's Board of Directors in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 18 Nobel Laureates. 

The Clock has become a universally recognised indicator of the world's vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons, climate change, and emerging technologies in  life sciences.

Since it was set up, the hand on the clock has moved 18 times, and each move represents how the scientists view the world's chances of survival in the face of these threats.

When the hand was moved to five minutes to midnight in 2012, the BAS said it believed the world had entered a 'second nuclear age'. 

The first nuclear age ended with the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty in 1991 by the US and Russia.

However, according to the BAS, both countries have a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons that could be launched at a moment's notice.

At the time, the BAS criticised nuclear watchdogs around the world for failing to take a stand on these weapons and national policies.

Soaring global temperatures: Noaa's data revealed that 2014 was the hottest year since records began. This map is made up of provisional data from 2014 up to October. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years

Terrorist threats: Recent  attacks in France, following the publication of a a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad in Charlie Hebdo (pictured), could feature among the reasons for moving the Clock's minute hand

Food shortages are expected to get worse

Last year's IPCC report claimed increases in crop yields have slowed over the last 40 years.

Some studies now point to dramatic declines in some crops over the next 50 years - especially wheat and corn.

Violent conflict may be triggered as a result

Climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees.

Fights over resources, like water and energy, hunger and extreme weather will all go into the mix to destabilise the world.

Gap between the rich and poor to widen

Poor people are going to bear an unfair burden of climate change, the report said.

Climate change is going to exacerbate existing inequalities, and it is going to make it harder for people to fight their way out of poverty. 

In 2014,  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report said there was evidence of accelerating climate change, and criticised the world's efforts to curb greenhouse emissions.

Global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880, according to US scientists.

And 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred in the 21st century, something highlighted by President Obama in his recent State of the Union address.

Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years.

The Met Office had previously announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the UK in records dating back to 1910.

Last year, President Obama  revealed his country's 30-year plan to modernise its nuclear program.

The modernisation is expected to cost almost £660 billion ($1 trillion), according to the Centre on Nuclear Security.
