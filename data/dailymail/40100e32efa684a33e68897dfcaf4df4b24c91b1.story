It's all fun and games in the Carroll household with West Ham striker Andy  photobombing his fiancee Billi Mucklow on Instagram.

The former star of hit TV show The Only Way Is Essex, revealed that she was pregnant via Twitter on Christmas Day, but that didn't stop the pair seemingly preparing to head out on Saturday night.

Carroll is no doubt enjoying a rare weekend off, with the Hammers not in action until Tuesday when they head to Merseyside to face Everton in the FA Cup.

Since returning from a lengthy injury spell in November, Carroll has enjoyed an extended run up front for West Ham, starting their last nine Premier League games. 

And he has also managed three goals in the process, as Sam Allardyce's side have enjoyed an impressive campaign so far.

The Hammers currently sit seventh in the Premier League after 20 games, and next face a trip to Swansea on Saturday following their midweek cup clash.
