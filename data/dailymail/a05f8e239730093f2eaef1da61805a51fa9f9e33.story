It was one ice cream truck versus another in a kick-off to the warmer months befitting a spaghetti Western.

‘This is my town,’ Joshua Malatino reportedly yelled at the driver of a Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck, as the out of town franchise, he believed, began to encroach on his Gloversville, New York territory.

Malatino, 34, owns a fanchise called Sno Cone Joe in the town near Albany, and that town was apparently not big enough for both Malatino’s company and Mr. Ding-A-Ling, reports the Times Union.

Feud: Cops say Joshua Malatino began harassing the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck as soon as it hit the streets of Gloversville, New York in April

The 53-year-old driver Phil Hollister went to police and said Malatino was making threats last month, including yelling things like, ‘You don’t have a chance' as he innocently plied his trade.

Hollister claimed Malatino, along with his girlfriend Amanda Scott, 21, also tried to intimidate him by stalking him around town in their own ice cream truck, blasting their music loudly when near him, and yelling ‘Free ice cream!’ when they saw someone approaching the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck.

‘I own this town,’ Malatino allegedly yelled in a phone call to Mr. Ding-A-Ling headquarters where he claimed Gloversville as his ice cream turf and nobody else’s.

On April 19, police say business really turned sour.

That’s when police in the small New York State town say they witnessed Malatino’s harassment while on patrol. An officer saw a Sno Cone Joe truck tailgating a Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck at a red light.

‘In the past, Malatino has been warned for this type of behavior,’ said Gloversville Police Capt. John Sira.

Sira said Matatino had been warned about his behavior as recently as this spring, after making similar threats last summer before muscling another ice cream truck out of town.

‘We warned him before that this type of 
behavior would not be tolerated,’ Sira said. ‘This is a pretty open 
market here in Gloversville as long as you have a permit.’

Police investigated the matter and on  Tuesday, Malatino and Scott were arrested on charges of harassment and misdemeanor stalking on three separate dates in April.

As shocking as this unlikely turf war may be to some, Mr. Ding-A-Ling owner Brian Collis remained unmoved.

‘Every year,’ Collis said, ‘he calls up and says “Who do you think you are, putting another truck in this town?”’

Collis said his driver in Gloversville continues to travel all his routes.

If convicted,  Malatino and Scott could get three months in jail.

Sweet deal: Hollister, pictured, said Malatino even offered free ice cream to people who approached the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck
