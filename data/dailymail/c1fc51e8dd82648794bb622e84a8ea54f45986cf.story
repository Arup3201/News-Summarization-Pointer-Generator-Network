Women play an important role in mediating the more reckless behaviour of their male counterparts

Women play an important business role in mediating the more reckless behaviour of their male counterparts, according to new research.

Most companies have a vast gender bias, with the boards of Britain's largest companies being less than 25 per cent female.

However new research published in the Journal of Corporate Finance shows that these women lower the cost to the company of takeovers and acquisition as women tend to avoid high risk, hot headed moves, the Telegraph reports.

Researchers from the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia investigated companies’ take-over purchases between 1997 and 2009 and compared the results of the bids to the number of female board members of each company.

They found that not only did the number of women on the board lower the number of takeover attempts, which are risky and offer little benefit to shareholders, but also that when takeovers did happen, they cost less. 

For every female board member companies also attempted 7.6 per cent fewer takeover bids, and the cost of each successful acquisition is reduced by more than 15 per cent for every woman on its board.

The effect seems to be due to women 
‘reining in’ the more aggressive men on the board, as well as being 
more frugal and questioning details.

The boards of Britain's largest companies are still made up of less than 25 per cent women

Prof Kai Li, co-author of the study, said: ‘Female board members play a significant role in mitigating the empire-building tendency of CEOs through the acquisition of other companies.

‘On average, merger and acquisition transactions don't create shareholder value, so women are having a real impact in protecting shareholder investment and overall firm performance.’
