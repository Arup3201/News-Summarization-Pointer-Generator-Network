Taxpayer-funded foreign aid supplies worth nearly half a million pounds ended up in the hands of Al Qaeda terrorists.

The supplies were seized from a warehouse by militant Islamist group al-Shabaab as it rampaged through southern Somalia.

Details of the thefts were buried in the Department for International Development’s latest annual accounts.

The growing chorus of fury

The thefts took place in repeated incidents over a four-month period between November 2011 and February 2012 – raising questions as to why no action was taken.

The revelations will increase pressure on ministers over Britain’s spiralling aid budget.

Last week UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom criticised increases in aid spending, saying it was going to dictators to buy ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris and Ferraris’.

He was criticised for using the phrase ‘Bongo Bongo land’ to describe recipients of aid. But commentators also backed his wider point about sharp increases in aid spending as the rest of government is enduring sharp cuts.

He said: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month, when we’re in this sort of debt, to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’ The Mail revealed last week that, during the length of this parliament, more than a billion pounds of aid was going to oil-rich Nigeria, which has its own space programme and wants to put a man in space.

Four other countries in Africa with space programmes are also in receipt of lavish aid spending.

Outspoken: His exact wording may have been out of order, but the point Godfrey Bloom was trying to get across on foreign aid may hit home now

Al-Shabaab is a cell of Al-Qaeda which, last year, threatened to carry out an attack on Britain that would ‘eclipse the horrors of 7/7 and 21/7 combined’. Several British nationals are known to have trained with the group.

DfID stated that there was no prior warning of the attacks and its partner organisations in Somalia were unable to move the supplies.

The accounts said the £480,000 was written off ‘following the theft between November 2011 and February 2012, by al-Shabaab in southern Somalia, of DfID-funded humanitarian materials and supplies from the offices and warehouses of partner organisations, to which DfID had provided funding to deliver projects and programmes’.

‘DfID’s partners had no prior warning of the confiscations being carried out and therefore had no time to prevent the loss by relocating goods.

‘While the theft suffered represented a stores loss, the property was not stolen from DfID stores. DfID funding was provided to purchase goods but no benefit was received by the end recipient due to the theft.’

Last night a spokesman claimed the supplies had been destroyed by the group. It said among the items stolen was ‘petty cash’.

A spokesman said: ‘DfID works in some of the most dangerous places in the world, including Somalia, because tackling the root causes of poverty and instability there ensures a safer world and a safer UK.

'Working in conflict-affected and fragile states carries inherent risk. DfID does all it can to mitigate against this but, on occasion, losses will occur.

‘We work with our partners to design programmes that protect our investment from misuse or theft.’

Aid spending is set to reach nearly £11billion by 2015, to meet a pledge by Mr Cameron that taxpayers should give away 0.7 per cent of GDP every year.

A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is yet more evidence of how hard it is to turn good intentions into genuine help for those in countries with deeply dysfunctional politics where security cannot be taken for granted.

‘Many taxpayers will see this as more evidence that foreign aid should not be increasing dramatically when there is so much pressure on other budgets.’
