A US Air Force mom has been charged with attempted murder after she allegedly tried to drown her baby when she was told that she could not take her on an overseas deployment.

Phoeteama Janiece Neal, 28, was stationed at Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, Arizona and was being deployed to Turkey on August 31.

She was also going through a custody battle with the child’s father.

Mugshot: Phoeteama Janiece Neal, was stationed at Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, Arizona and had been told she could not take her 20-month old daughter when she deployed to Turkey on August 31

The
 mom, who had full custody of her daughter up until this month, was told by a judge that
 custody would go to the child's father when she deployed.

According to the Office of Special Investigation for the Air Force Ms Neal went to her commander at Luke Air Force Base after the court hearing and asked that she not be deployed.

She was told by the Air Force that they would 'get back to her.'

On Monday afternoon, Ms Neal called 911 and between sobs, told the dispatcher, ‘I just drowned my baby. She’s drowned.’

Then, midway through the call, she said that she thought the girl was already dead and put the phone down.

Paramedics were able to revive the girl, who remains in extremely critical condition at a nearby hospital with less than a 1 per cent chance of survival.
