A former Montana Catholic school teacher who was fired for being pregnant and unmarried is suing the school district.

Shaela Evenson, who gave birth to a boy in March, filed the lawsuit Thursday alleging the firing violated federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination based on pregnancy, the Montana Standard reported.

She had taught literature and physical education at Butte Central Catholic Schools for grades 6 through 8 for nine years until she was fired in January.

At the time, Superintendent Patrick Haggarty said that Evenson had ‘made a willful decision to violate the terms of her contract,’ which requires her to respect the moral and religious teachings of the Catholic Church in both her professional and personal life.

‘The Catholic moral teaching is that the sacrament of marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman,’ Haggarty said.

‘And we certainly believe and we teach our children who attend our schools about the sacrament of marriage,' he added. 'That's as old as our church.

'Not only do we teach that to the children kindergarten through 12th grade, but we're held to that standard as well.’

Schools officials began to look into Evenson in January, after the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena received a letter about her pregnancy.

Her boss, Principal Kerrie Hellyer, said Evenson 'was an excellent teacher.'

Evenson, who is not Catholic herself, became pregnant through artificial insemination and gave birth to a boy on March 7, the first child for Evenson and her partner, Marilyn Tobin.

Her attorney, Brian Butler of Ohio, filed a discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier this month.

He argued an employer can't require employees to waive their rights under anti-discrimination laws — including a woman's right to bear children.

Schools officials denied the firing had anything to do with Evenson being in a same-sex relationship.

'They told her she was fired for being pregnant and unmarried,' Butler said. 'Nobody was hiding anything. (Shaela) never denied the fact that she’s in a relationship with Marilyn.'

Evenson's attorney won a $170,000 jury award in a similar case in Ohio.
