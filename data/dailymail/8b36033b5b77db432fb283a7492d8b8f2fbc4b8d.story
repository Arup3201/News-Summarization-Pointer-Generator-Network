A drunk single mother bit a police officer while she was being arrested after teachers refused to let her pick up her children from an after school club.

Danielle Florentine, 28, sank her teeth into a female WPC’s wrist as she was being handcuffed at St John the Baptist Primary School in Padiham, Lancashire when a teacher refused to hand over her two children.

Florentine arrived 20 minutes late to pick up her children on November 8 and started causing trouble when her children did not appear.

Refused children: Danielle Florentine became abusive, even biting a police officer, when a teacher refused to let her pick up her two children when she arrived at the school drunk

By the time the police arrived at the scene, Florentine was abusive, shouting and swearing. On the way to the station she kicked the back of the van and continued to be aggressive in a police holding cell, prosecutor Eddie Harrison told Burnley Magistrates Court. 

The court heard how she had ‘lost track of time’ while drinking with a female friend after hearing her grandfather had just weeks to live.

Florentine, of Padiham, Lancashire wept as she admitted being drunk and disorderly and police assault.

Magistrates accepted that her behaviour was ‘completely out of character’ for her and she was fined £110, ordered to pay £100 compensation and a £20 victim surcharge.

It emerged she had two previous convictions, including common assault on her former boyfriend’s ex-wife for which she had been banned from pubs.

Daniel Frazer, defending, said in mitigation Florentine said: ‘There is no suggestion this is a regular occurrence.

‘It seems to be simply a one-off. She had gone to the school and had been told the children’s father, her ex-partner, was going to be called to pick the children up.

‘That seemed to have inflamed the situation as she had been subjected to quite extensive violence at his hands and a restraining order had been made.

‘Understandably, she was upset that person was now being called to collect her children.

‘She was shocked at the language she had used, especially on school premises.

‘The children had not been present as they were being cared for elsewhere in the school.

‘The police officer had had her hand over the defendant’s mouth and she was struggling to breathe.

‘She is genuinely upset she is here. She is remorseful. There is no suggestion she is not a good mother. It seems to have been this one day, this one lapse.’

Burnley Liberal Democrat MP Gordon Birtwistle said after the case: ‘It’s a disgrace. She was highly irresponsible. I fully support the school for refusing to hand over the children to somebody in that state.

‘The most important people in all of this are the children. It is extremely unfortunate and I support the school and police for their actions.’

A spokesman for the school said: ‘We will continue to work with the family concerned in the best interests of the children.’
