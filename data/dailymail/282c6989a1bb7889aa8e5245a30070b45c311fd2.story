From columns that shake, to waves of colours and rotating snakes, these optical illusions should not be viewed if you've just eaten.

Each stomach-churning design was created by a former animal psychologist who became fascinated by the illusions when he studied monkeys in a neuroscience institute.

They are so powerful that each image comes with a health warning, and if you start to feel dizzy or sick cover one eye and look away - don’t close your eyes completely.

Professor Akiyoshi Kitaoka, from Ritsumseikan University, in Kyoto, Japan, has spent more than a decade creating his collection of works. The professor devised the Rotating Snake illusion (pictured) in 2003, which comes with a warning on his website, due to the feeling of nausea it could cause some viewers

Optical Illusions use colour, light and patterns to create images that deceive or mislead the brain. 

The information collected by the eye is processed by the brain.

In the process of converting what it sees, the brain tries to make sense of the different colours and patterns.  

This creates a perception that doesn't match the image, and confuses the brain.  

This is because the illusions can become more prominent, and the effect worsens, when eyes are closed completely.

The images were created by Professor Akiyoshi Kitaoka, from Ritsumseikan University, in Kyoto Japan.

The 52-year-old has spent more than a decade creating his collection either from scratch, or by developing existing designs. 

The professor also devised the Rotating Snake illusion in 2003, which comes with a warning on his website due to the feeling of nausea it can cause some viewers.

This image is called Irrigation and it looks like rollers printed with blue dots turning towards each other in a line. Each design is either created through a process of trial and error, or based on illusion experiments of the past. Professor Kitaoka began designing the images in the mid-90s, and has created hundreds of different designs

Professor Kitaoka’s Button image (pictured) features rows of circles that look like they’re increasing in size and coming towards the viewer. Optical Illusions use colour, light and patterns to create images that deceive or mislead the brain.

In Rotating Rays (pictured) the central ring of squares rotates anticlockwise as the outer circles of squares move slowly clockwise. Having originally studied animal psychology, Professor Kitaoka, 52, decided to focus on optical illusions after looking into their effect on monkeys, while working at a neuroscience institute

All of his designs stem from Professor Kitaoka's interest in the brain's interpretation of signals from the eyes.

He began designing the images in the mid-90s, and has since created hundreds of different illusions.

Irrigation (pictured) works in a similar way to the Rollers image. It appears as if rows of seeds are being moved through rollers

This image, called Snake Conveyors, features rows that appear to move diagonally, especially when viewed in a person's peripheral vision. Though more straightforward experiments, such as the eye's interpretation of the colour, are important to science, the professor said that the public generally prefer his more artist works

Optical illusions, which were extremely popular during the Op Art movement of the 1960s, create the feeling that a motionless image is somehow moving. In this image, called Ampan Factory, the columns of red dots appear to move up and down on the blue background and at times look like they're shaking

Optical illusions, which were extremely popular during the Op Art movement of the 1960s, create the feeling that a motionless image is somehow moving.

However, Professor Kitaoka posts a caution on his website for anyone who feels sick: ‘Some of the pictures on this website can cause dizziness or might possibly epileptic seizures.

‘The latter happens when the brain can't handle the conflicting information from your two eyes.

‘If you start feeling unwell when using this website, immediately cover one eye with your hand and then leave the page.

‘Do not close your eyes because that can make the attack worse.’

In one image, called Swimming Rings, yellow circles on a purple background appear to move towards each other.

Similarly, pink columns of spots on a blue background in the image called Ampan Factory appear to move up and down.

Professor Kitaoka’s Button image features rows of circles that look like they’re increasing in size and coming towards the viewer - a similar experience is seen in his Rotating Rays image.

In Construction Of A Subway By Rabbits, the inner circle rotates, and in Rollers the screen looks as if it’s a piece of paper being moved up and down.

Bulge is the only black and white image in the collection, and it has been designed to look like the central circle is protruding from the background.

The most colourful images, known as Autumn Colour Swamp and Primrose Field, resemble the Magic Eye pictures of the 1990s.

In the former, squares move around the centre of the image, while the latter looks like a picnic blanket blowing in the wind.

Meanwhile, Irrigation looks like rows of seeds being moved through rollers.

One of the professor's most recent experiments looks at a basic illusion - how veins appear blue to a human, but, at best, they are actually a very light great on the colour spectrum.

Though more straightforward experiments, such as the eye's interpretation of the colour, are important to science, the professor said the public generally prefer his more artist works.

One of the most colourful images in the collection is Primrose Field, (pictured) which resembles a picnic blanket blowing in the wind

Professor Kitaoka said: ‘I love every work, but Rotating Snakes seems to be the favourite among most people.

‘I became interested in optical illusions when I worked at a neuroscience institute, twelve years ago.

‘Some of my works come from trial and error, whereas others are logical progressions of previous designs.

‘My optical illusion works are people's favourites, but the other, more basic illusion images [how something appears one colour, but is actually another, for example] do not get so much attention.’
