Part of Oslo's central train station was evacuated this morning after the discovery of an abandoned suitcase.

And police were looking for a 'dangerous' and unstable man released from prison on Monday who claims to identify himself with the man who launched fatal bomb and shooting attacks last week.

The Norwegian Railway Authority said the suitcase was found in on one of the buses which links the Oslo Sentral to the city's airport.

Evacuated: The main train station in Norway's capital, Oslo S, has been evacuated after a suspicious suitcase was discovered this morning

Threat: A police officer stands outside the car park entrance to Oslo S station. Reports say a man was seen leaving the suitcase on a bus, before leaving the station

Police sealed off the area, but the abandoned luggage was later found not to contain anything suspicious.

A fireman at the scene said: 'There is some baggage that was left on a bus and that the police bomb squad is checking it out.'

An official for NSB, the national rail service, said: 'All the trains and the buses have been cancelled until further notice.

'Under police orders nobody is allowed to go into the station.'

Jack Vaadahl, the driver of a bus scheduled to travel to Oslo airport, said he reported the suspicious suitcase to security personnel.

He said: 'A suspicious person left in a hurry... leaving his luggage on the bus.'

Cordoned off: The bus was scheduled to drive to Oslo's airport when the driver spotted the bag left on board

Investigation: Police are also looking for a 'dangerous' man released from prison on Monday who claims to identify with massacre suspect Anders Breivik

NTB news agency reported that someone was spotted putting a suitcase on a bus near railway track 19 and then leaving the scene.

The city is on high alert in the wake of Friday's bombing and youth camp shooting that killed at least 68 people.

The first Cabinet ministers were due to return to their offices today after the car bomb exploded in the government district of the Norwegian capital.

Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year-old Norwegian, has confessed to the attacks, according to police and his lawyer, but pleaded not guilty to the killings.

In a rambling 1,500-page manifesto, he claims to have been associated with two terror cells within the country, as well as others abroad.

Acting alone? Breivik leaves court in Oslo on Monday. The 32-year-old has admitted detonating a bomb in the capital and a mass-shooting on Utoya island, but denies killing at least 68 people

It comes as a Norwegian Cabinet minister was preparing to make a symbolic return to her bomb-damaged office as the nation tries to return to some form of normality.

Administration and Church Affairs Minister Rigmor Aasrud will be the first to return to her normal office after the blast blew a hole through the prime minister's office and badly damaged other buildings.

For the moment, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg will work from the defence ministry and cabinet meetings will be held in a medieval fort near the Oslo waterfront.

It is unclear whether the prime minister's 17-storey building will be rebuilt or torn down.Police blew up at cache of explosives found at a farm rented by Breivik last night.

He is believed to have developed his bomb using fertiliser he bought under the cover of being a farmer.
