Arsenal's squad contains players from almost all corners of the globe, but it hasn't taken long for some of their key players to adapt to their London surroundings.

The likes of Mesut Ozil and Mikel Arteta have been fairly new arrivals in the last few years, but they appear to have picked up a rather peculiar London accent at the club's new kit launch.

'Apples and pears' - stairs

'Trouble and strife' - wife

'Adam and Eve' - believe

'Butchers hook' - look

'Barnet Fair' - hair

'Dog and bone' - phone

'Beans on toast' - post

Or make that a strong one. Along with Aaron Ramsey the duo appear to have either developed an incredible knack of impersonating accents or there's been some dubbing work done in Arsenal's media department.

Either way, it's hilarious to listen to and it would be incredibly disappointing not to hear any of them maintain the regional touch to any interviews over the next season.

More worryingly for Arsenal fans though is what has happened to Olivier Giroud, with the club's striker seemingly having undergone reverse puberty and gain the vocal chords of a child.

As long as the France hitman continues to fire in the goals, Arsenal fans won't care too much, but which accent will new Â£30m signing Alexis Sanchez adopt?

Arsenal legends also get in on the act, with Charlie George, Michael Thomas and Thierry Henry featuring as the voices for Jack Wilshere, Tomas Rosicky and Santi Cazorla respectively.

There could be an answer as to where the London lessons have come from, though.

Actor Ray Winstone is a prime suspect but former midfielder Ray Parlour has taught Lukas Podolski a few rhyming slang words in the past.

Arsenal's players having a voice identity crisis coincides with the release of three new Gunners strips ahead of the new season by new kit suppliers Puma, who have taken over from Nike.
