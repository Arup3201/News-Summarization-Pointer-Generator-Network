It is a hard-fought game where players are taught not to shirk a tackle.

But Rugby Union’s ruling body has been accused of going soft by trying to remove the competitive edge of the sport for children.

It wants schools and clubs to switch players between sides at half-time to make games less one-sided and to ban trophies from tournaments for the under 11’s in order to stop disillusioned youngsters giving up.

However attempts to introduce a more level playing field have backfired with one former England international pulling his club out of mini-rugby competitions.

Simon Halliday, who was part of the England’s 1992 Five Nations Championship winning side, said: ‘Rugby is a lesson in life.

‘Nobody wants to see a young side get panned but if one team wins by 30 points you have to say “congratulations” and the other team goes off to lick its wounds and ask what went wrong.’

On Sunday mornings tens of thousands of youngsters play mini-rugby, using a smaller ball and playing on a smaller pitch.

But the Rugby Football Union (RFU) is 
concerned at the number of children who drop out in their teens instead 
of graduating to the adult game.

Try hard: Simon Halliday, who played for Bath and Harlequins, blasted the guidelines and said: 'You can¿t tell an eight-year-old that the result doesn¿t matter'

It therefore is urging clubs to 
concentrate on playing skills and enjoying being on the field rather 
than the result.

This in mind Surrey Rugby, one of RFU’s constituent bodies, has sent out new rules for a forthcoming min-club festival.

Rival coaches have been told they must consult on the levels of their teams before a match and switch players at half-time if the score is too one-sided.

Clubs have been warned they will be disciplined if they ignore the new guidelines.

But two clubs - Esher, from Surrey, and Rosslyn Park, from south-west London, are so incensed they have pulled out of the tournament.

Mr Halliday, who played for Bath and Harlequins, said: ‘I get the full gamut of trying to encourage children to play but you can’t tell an eight-year-old that the result doesn’t matter.’

However RFU development director Steve Grainger says it is more important to keep the children interested than meet the adult’s needs.

He said: ‘This is not about denying children competitive rugby. Rugby is a competitive team sport and always will be and as a father myself I know how competitive children are.

‘But we must evolve a player-centred game which is enjoyable and allows young people to develop.

‘That is our Kids First Rugby programme, where the core skills are brought to the fore while maintaining the integrity of the sport as a game for all shapes and sizes.’
