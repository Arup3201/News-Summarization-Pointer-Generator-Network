The card inside the book shows it was due to be returned on New Year's Eve 1950

Some books are almost impossible to put down, but one reader was so enamored with a copy of the children's classic Pinocchio they returned it 63 years overdue.

Staff at Rugby Library in Warwickshire thought they had lost their copy of ‘The Adventures Of Pinocchio’ forever after it vanished in 1950.

But librarians were left stunned when their copy of the popular children's story by Carlo Collodi was returned last Friday during an eight-day fines amnesty.

A ticket found inside the cover of the 68-year-old publication had been due to be returned on New Year’s Eve 1950.

If the book been been returned after the amnesty ended, the unnamed library user would have faced a penalty of £5.22 - which is the council’s cap for late returns.

But if the cap wasn’t in place, based on the council’s current charges of 18p per day, the reader would have faced paying more than £4,000.

Librarian Joanna Grindle said: 'During my 34 years as a librarian I have never known a book to be that overdue.

'It is amazing to think how much the library has changed since the book was taken out in 1950.

'Of course, I’m pleased to say we have plenty of other Pinocchio books in our children’s section so I don’t think anyone missed out.

'Although our children’s stock is 
refreshed on a more regular basis we will definitely keep the book 
safely at Rugby Library - after all it has a wonderful story of its own 
to tell.'

Councillor Colin Hayfield, from Warwickshire County Council said: 'We are pleased that after all this time the borrower felt they could return the book.

'We always wanted to use the fines amnesty to welcome people back who haven’t visited us for a while and we hope the borrower is enjoying our services again.'

The book was due to be returned the same year Princess Anne and TV presenter Jeremy Paxman were born.

The popular children's book was written by Carlo Collodi

The English national football team also made its first appearance at a World Cup finals in 1950 and Sainsbury’s opened the first purpose-built supermarket in Croydon.

Warwickshire County Council’s fines amnesty was launched on National Libraries Day Saturday 8 February 8 and ran until Saturday February 15.

Britain’s most overdue library book was ‘Good Words for 1888’ which was an astonishing 123 years overdue which was unearthed at a historic house in the Lake District in December 2011.

In 2011 Pulp rocker Jarvis Cocker also admitted hoarding an old school library book which he finally returned 30 years after it was due back.

The Adventures of Pinocchio was written as a children's book by Italian author Carlo Collodi in 1883. It told the story of a poor woodcarver named Gepetto who carved a marionette out of a piece of wood.

The marionette came to life and became his son Pinocchio whose nose would grow hugely whenever he told a lie.

The story has spawned a host of television and film adaptations, most famously the 1940 interpretation of the same name by Walt Disney.
