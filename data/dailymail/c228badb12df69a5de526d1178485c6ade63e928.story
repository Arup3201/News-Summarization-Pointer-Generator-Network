Islamists are widely expected to win a majority in Egypt's new parliament after threatening a crackdown on alcohol and bikinis.

The popularity of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party has left Egypts tourist industry fearing they will be elected when the parliament reconvenes next month.

The Brotherhood has said tourists can do without alcohol while ultra-conservative Salafist candidates have taken it a step further by demanding a ban on all alcohol sales.

They've also called for segregating Egypt's beaches by sex and banning revealing swimwear.

Political unrest and violence have kept tourists away from this and other Egyptian landmarks since the fall of former president, Hosni Mubarak.

Officials say the number of visitors this holiday season is down by more than one-third compared to the same time last year.

Hisham Zaazou, the senior assistant tourism minister, said: 'These are irresponsible statements in my opinion that, even if said by responsible people, I believe they do not understand the set-up of the industry and the dynamics of it.'

'Four out of five tourists who come to Egypt do so for leisure vacations at the beach rather than to visit the pyramids or other historical sites.

'More than three-quarters of all visitors to Egypt are from Europe,' he says. 'They expect to be able to enjoy the beach as they would at home.

'To swim, you wear a bathing costume. To have dinner, part of the culture is to have a drink with the dinner.

'This is the kind of information people have to understand that do not understand the industry. And you don't change the culture of people,' Mr Zaazou said.

But Azza al-Jarf, the Islamist lawmaker, says Egyptian officials need to rethink their approach to tourism.

She argues that appealing to Muslim visitors abroad and domestically will boost tourism, as would hosting more international conferences.

She adds that separating beaches by sex and curbing public consumption of alcohol won't affect these new markets or even the old ones.

Such pronouncements are naive, says Elhamy el-Zayat, who chairs the Egyptian Tourism Federation and runs a company specialising in conference tourism.

He says he's talked with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafists at length about their tourism proposals and why they won't work.

He believes that once the Islamists are in power and faced with the financial reality, they'll stop trying to make Egyptian tourists conform to a more conservative Islamic lifestyle.

'If they were not pragmatic, could they have collected so many votes?' Mr el-Zayat said. 'They were very pragmatic and very sly, we have to remember this.'
