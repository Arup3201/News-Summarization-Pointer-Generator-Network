The financial drama at Leeds has taken a new twist, with lawyers representing the club’s former managing director, David Haigh, writing to the Football League to say he can provide information relating to serious allegations about the club’s co-owner, Gulf Finance House (GFH), in its purchase of the club in 2012.

A letter making the claims, including a potential breach of US Iran sanctions, has been sent to League chief executive Shaun Harvey — who was chief executive at Leeds in 2012 — and the League’s director of legal affairs, Nick Craig.

GFH deny wrongdoing and question the credibility of Haigh, 37, who has been held at a Dubai police station without charge since May, accused of misappropriating more than £3m of GFH’s money, for whom he used to work.

A GFH spokesman said: ‘We are not aware of this letter and so cannot comment in any detail. We are satisfied GFH has always behaved in an appropriate manner... However, one of our former employees has been subject to both criminal and civil investigation over a variety of possible criminal actions, including fraud and money laundering, during the last few months and we are therefore unable to answer on specifics.’

Haigh was GFH Capital’s front man when they bought Leeds from Ken Bates in late 2012 for around £17million and as such is party to intimate knowledge of the firm’s business.

Well-placed sources acknowledge Haigh did indeed receive the funds he is accused of misappropriating from GFH although his defence, whenever it is lodged, will say he was owed the cash in salary, commissions and expenses.

Haigh’s new accusations against GFH will run the risk of implicating himself, as a former employee and insider.

The letter from Haigh’s lawyers continues: ‘Clearly the information will need to be investigated thoroughly and our client is keen to assist in this process.’

The League have declined to comment but because GFH still owns and/or control 25 per cent of the club, the situation is potentially a huge embarrassment for them as a body and for Harvey personally.

Harvey worked at Leeds under GFH until summer 2013. He became the League’s chief executive officer last autumn.

A GFH spokesman said: ‘The funds used to acquire Leeds and to support the club was from the GFH group and its clients and not sanctioned Iranian funds, as has been insinuated.’
