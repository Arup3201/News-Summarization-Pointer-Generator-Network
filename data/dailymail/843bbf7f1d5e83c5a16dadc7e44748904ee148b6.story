The brother of an Australian boxer has been ordered to pay a $730 fine for hitting a seven-year-old boy with a plastic bottle after he lost his temper during one of his brother's bouts at the Commonwealth Games.

Perth man Laith Samardali, 25 was ordered to pay the fine by the Glasgow Sherriff Court yesterday after he caused a commotion in the stands fight on Tuesday night, when his brother Jordan Samardali's fight was stopped 39 seconds into the first round.

Samardali became angry when the bout was stopped and another man in the crowd told him to watch his language because there were children watching.

At this point Samardali threw a plastic bottle at the man, which missed him and hit a seven-year-old boy causing him to cry, the court heard.

Samardali pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and acting in a threatening and abusive manner.

Glasgow Sheriff Norman Ritchie ordered him to pay $365 compensation each to the man and the boy.

Mr Ritchie told Laith Samardali that his behaviour was 'abusive' and had ruined the boy's experience of the Commonwealth Games.

'The little boy was attending an event in the city that should have filled him with long lasting pleasant memories. Now he will have the recollection of a bad man shouting and swearing and throwing a bottle at him,' the Sydney Morning Herald reported him as saying.

Samardali intends to return to Australia over the weekend.

Jordan Samardali lost the Tuesday night quarter-final by technical knock-out to Kennedy St Pierre from Mauritius, dashing his medal hopes.

He pleaded with the referee to be allowed to continue to fight, but the official would not change his mind.

Jordan Samardali has spoken before about the inspiration he has found from his brother, who was also a boxer.

Laith Samardali's boxing career ended when he was knocked into a coma after he got into a fight on a night out with friends in Perth in 2010.
