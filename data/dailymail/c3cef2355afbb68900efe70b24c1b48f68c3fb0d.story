The historic British city of Chester has beaten Venice, Prague and Santorini on a list of the most beautiful cities in Europe favored by Americans.

Never mind Paris and Venice, both often thought of as some of the most romantic cities in Europe, or Budapest for its rich historic offering – Chester in Cheshire was the fifth choice city behind Riga, Bergen, Innsbruck and Dubrovnik in an American newspaper poll.

USA Today, the newspaper that ran the online survey, attributed the Roman walls and ‘charming collection of Tudor and Victorian buildings and a delightful shopping district filled with half-timbered shops reminiscent of a Grimm tale,’ to Chester’s high ranking.

It continued: ‘There's not a modern structure in sight, making Chester one of the most popular destinations for visitors to Cheshire.’

Chester MP Stephen Mosley said it was ‘fantastic news’. He said: ‘I am staggered that there are four European cities deemed prettier than Chester. But not surprised that our city was rated so highly.

‘Whether it’s the landmark Eastgate clock, our world famous city walls or our beautiful Cathedral – you can see it in Chester.

In the spotlight: The city was in the spotlight earlier this month after Amber Langford and Annie Collinge caused outrage for dressing up as the twin towers for a fancy dress competition in a Chester nightclub

'We've triumphed over Rome': Chester MP said he was not surprised the city (pictured) was rated so highly, coming in behind Riga, Bergen, Innsbruck and Dubrovnik

‘Two thousand years after the Romans conquered Chester, we’ve triumphed over Rome.’

The city of 120,000 was in
the spotlight earlier this month after two students caused outrage for 
dressing up as the twin towers for a fancy dress competition at a 
Chester nightclub.

Pristine condition: Chester is considered one of Britain's most well preserved walled cities with several Grade 1-listed heritage buildings

Amber 
Langford and Annie Collinge, both 19, won the contest and a £150 prize 
at the nightclub despite lampooning the worst terrorist attack in modern
history.

They had modelled their costumes on the North and South Tower wreathed in flames and with victims jumping from windows. Both women also wore hats topped with the wreckage of the planes and U.S. flags.

The city is also popular with top footballers, such as Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen, who join the crowds for Chester races at Britain’s oldest racecourse.

Some Chester residents showed their surprise at the city's title.

One wrote on the Chester Chronicle website: 'Not a modern structure in sight? Did they put a big towel over the Travelodge?'

Another wrote: 'Whilst I think parts of Chester are unquestionably picturesque and historic, does anyone honestly think that the entire city is more beautiful than places like Paris, Venice, Prague?'

Chester is considered one of Britain’s most well preserved walled cities, boasting almost two miles of Roman walls. It is also home to several Grade 1-listed medieval and Victorian buildings.

The city was founded as a Roman fort in the year 79 and its four main roads were laid out almost 2,000 years ago.

1. Riga, Latvia

2. Bergen, Norway

3. Innsbruck, Austria

4. Dubrovnik, Croatia

5. Chester, England

6. Prague, Czech Republic

7. Budapest, Hungary

8. Santorini, Greece (pictured)

9. Venice, Italy

10. Bruges, Belgium
