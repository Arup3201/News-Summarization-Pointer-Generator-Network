A Kansas woman who left a hair dryer running to warm her infant daughter on a freezing night has been sentenced to three years' probation for the baby's death from hyperthermia.

Brigit Hippen of Hutchinson pleaded no contest last month to involuntary manslaughter in the February 2010 death of her 2-month-old daughter, Karina Perez.

Hippen's sentencing Tuesday spared her from a second-degree murder charge she previously faced.

Hippen told investigators she placed a running hair dryer near Karina's bassinet in the bathroom of her apartment to warm the baby, then she fell asleep herself in the other room.

When she woke, three hours later, she found the baby unresponsive.

Doctors have said Karina's temperature was 108 when she died.

'She didn't mean to, but she fell asleep. She just fell asleep,' Hippen's attorney David Harger previously said in court according to the Hutchinson News.

Mr Harger described Hippen and the baby's father Oscar Perez as being 'devastated' by the baby's death.

Prosecutors painted a different picture saying Hippen, who was 20 at the time of her baby's death in 2010, acted with 'extreme indifference to the value of human life,' according to the paper.

Arguments: Hippen's defense described the baby's parents as devastated by her death while prosecutors claimed the mother was unable to grasp the value of another human life

Hippen still faces trial for a separate case in which she is charged with felony criminal damage to property and misdemeanor battery in a separate incident. The trial in that case is tentatively set for February 28.

This case centers on an incident which occurred on May 29 of last year, when she allegedly punched another woman in the face for dancing with her boyfriend.

Hippen is also caused of damaging the woman's car.
