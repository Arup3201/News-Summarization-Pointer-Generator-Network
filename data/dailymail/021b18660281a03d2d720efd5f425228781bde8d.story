Carol Thatcher returned to Britain last night to help with the preparations for her  mother’s funeral.

Miss Thatcher, who lives in Klosters, Switzerland, arrived at her mother’s home in Belgravia shortly before 7pm.

She arrived in a black Jaguar accompanied by a casually dressed man believed to be her boyfriend Marco Grass.

Dressed in a black shawl with black 
trousers and large dark sunglasses, the 59-year-old appeared emotional 
as she was met on the steps by her twin brother Mark who quickly ushered
her into the house.

Meanwhile, programming chiefs at ITV 
rejected plans for a news special to provide full  coverage of Lady 
Thatcher’s funeral, opting instead for it to be covered through This Morning, it emerged yesterday.

Journalists at the broadcaster were 
dismayed to learn that Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield will be 
used as a link to the funeral as they present their popular daytime 
show.

According to sources, Alastair Stewart
and Julie Etchingham had been lined up to present if the broadcaster 
had agreed to traditional live coverage on Wednesday. Now Miss 
Willoughby, 32,  and Mr Schofield will link to Mr  Stewart to provide 
‘live updates’.

Siblings: This is the first time in a decade that Mark and Carol Thatcher have been seen in public together

Family mourns: The siblings briefly appeared on the steps of their mother's home tonight, their first appearance together since their father's funeral

In comparison, the BBC will  provide 
more heavyweight  coverage through veteran  presenter David Dimbleby, 
who will front a three-hour special.

ITV insiders say proposals for a 
special programme fronted by its journalists were rejected because of 
the cost, understood to be in the region of £500,000.

One reporter on ITV News said: ‘There is always disappointment when you are leaving full coverage to others.’

Meanwhile it has been reported that Italy premier Silvio Berlusconi will not be attending the funeral, despite a concerted effort to gain an invitation.

Mr Berlusconi’s office made ‘numerous 
and insistent’ phone calls to the Italian embassy in London, but acting 
prime minister Mario Monti will represent Italy.
