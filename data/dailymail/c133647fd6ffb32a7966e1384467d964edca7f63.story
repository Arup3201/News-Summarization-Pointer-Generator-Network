Two women rafters have died in the space of just 24 hours after getting caught up in vicious rapids on the same river.

The first victim had been rafting with family and friends on the Ocoee River in Tennessee, USA, when she was thrown overboard in rapids.

The middle-aged woman, from Atlanta, Georgia reportedly grabbed a rescue rope but then lost consciousness at the popular commercial rafting venue and former Olympic whitewater course used during the 1996 Atlanta games.

Almost 24 hours later the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation said that a woman from Smyrna, Tennessee., fell out of a raft on Sunday morning when it got stuck in rapids.

Scott Brooks, a spokesman from the Tennessee Valley Authority which controls the amount of water in the river with three dams said that the river flow was higher than normal on Saturday when the first woman met her death.

Mr Brooks said the authority was looking into the river's flow and height.

Newspaper Times Free Press reported that according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office both women were thrown from their rafts after encountering steep drops on a rapid known as 'Grumpy's', which stretches around 100 yards below a dam.

On Saturday a woman in her 40s was among two ejected from the raft.

One rider was brought back aboard and while the victim was able to grab onto a rescue rope and hold on as she waited to be rescued, she lost consciousness just before reaching the shore.

The following day the second woman was among several people thrown from the raft in the rapid and although her friends made it back to the riverbank safely she was unable to.

Rescuers perfomed CPS on her to try to save her life but were unsuccessful.

Both women were taken to the Copper Basin Medical Center in Copperhill, where they were later pronounced dead.
