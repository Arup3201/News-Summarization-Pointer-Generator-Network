No justice: It was revealed Tuesday that dozens of suspected criminals were released in Detroit, because the county prosecutor's office, headed by Kym Worthy (pictured), failed to sign warrants in time

A shocking new report shows that dozens of suspected rapists, murderers and child abusers were released back onto the streets of Detroit in the last four years, because county prosecutors didn't sign warrants in time to keep the accused behind bars.

The Detroit News reports that the office's backlog of outstanding warrants goes back to 2010, and includes 21 for murder, 105 for sexual assault and 126 for child abuse.

Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy explained the chilling statistic, saying budget cuts have whittled down her staff who are now struggling to keep up with the cases.

'I have been saying for two years what would happen if our budget was cut,' Worthy told the Detroit News. 'We have lost half of our staff and it is no surprise that we are not able to fulfill our mandated functions with such drastic staff reductions.' 

In one especially sobering example, a rapist was released after prosecutors failed to sign a warrant and he went on to assault three more women.

Detroit Police arrested Jamieson Kelley in September 2011 after a woman claimed he raped her at his apartment. 

Police believed the woman's account since Kelley had been released from prison just three months earlier after finishing a 10-year sentence for sexual assault. Furthermore,  the victim was able to identify Kelley from a photo line-up and confirm his address. 

But because the case was based on 'one person's word against another' prosecutors decided they didn't have a strong enough case and did not sign the warrant, letting Kelley go free. 

He went on to rape three more women in 2013 and 2014, and was eventually arrested again. 

Most infuriating for the police, when it came time for Kelley's trial this year, they asked the original 2011 victim to testify, despite the fact that they found her too 'unreliable' three years prior. 

Disappointment: The slow work of the prosecutor's office has made Detroit Police Chief James Craig's (pictured) job difficult, as his officers are constantly having to release suspected criminals they worked hard to arrest 

'If they're saying it's something we should've done in our investigation, that's one thing,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told the News. 'But if we're talking about a witness not being credible, how can they then turn around and use that same witness in a later case? Either she's credible or she isn't.' 

Kelley pleaded guilty to rape charges in November and was sentenced to between 22 and half to 50 years in prison, but Craig hates the fact that the additional rapes could have been prevented.

'We believed we arrested the right suspect, and it turned out we were right. This man is a predator who was allowed to go back and rape more women.' 

Cases like Kelley's have led to a rift between prosecutors and the police, who are constantly having to release inmates they have worked hard to jail because of the prosecutors' slow work.

The suspects who were released in the last four years were arrested by police, but let go after prosecutors failed to formally arraign them within the required 72 hours. 

Worthy says keeping up is impossible with her staff severely cut down in the bankrupt city's budget crisis.  The office currently has 154 staff attorneys, after losing 90 more this year in the latest round of cuts, spokesman Maria Miller said.

In 2010, the Warrant's division had eight full-time attorneys and two to three project consultants. Now the office has just five full-time attorneys, with one who works an abbreviated 32 hours a week and a part-timer.

While Chief Craig is sympathetic to the budget cuts, he says he is pressed with the same issues and still has to continue his department as usual.  

However, the prosecutor's office points out that some of the issues with the warrants go back to police not doing enough investigative work.  Miller says cases are commonly sent back for further interviews, forensic analysis or evidence that wasn't provided. 

'Over the last year, we have seen an increase across the board for Detroit cases that must be returned for further work,' Miller said. 'Prosecutor Worthy estimates that a fourth of all DPD cases across the entire office are returned for further investigation.'

In addition to the unsigned warrants, the Detroit police also have a backlog of 11,000 untested rape kits which were discovered in 2009.
