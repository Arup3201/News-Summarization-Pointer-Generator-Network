Arsenal could be in line to sine Catania full-back Gino Peruzzi, according to reports in Italy.

Arsene Wenger was linked with the Argentinian defender last summer but never actually made a bid, then Serie A side Catania swooped in and paid Velez Sarsfield Â£2.5 for the right-back.

The 22-year-old played 23 times in total for the Serie A club last season but respected Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio has said Arsenal representatives have met with Peruzzi and he could be allowed to leave should a suitable bid come in for him.

Arsenal appear well-stocked at right-back with new signing Mathieu Debuchy joining Carl Jenkinson and Hector Bellerin in north London.

However, with rumours that Jenkinson will be sent out on loan, Wenger could be in the market for a back-up.

Javier Manquillo had been set to join The Gunners, but the 20-year-old Atletico Madrid full-back appears to have chosen Liverpool as his preferred destination.
