A new investigation has lifted the lid on the global fashion industry dynamics that make designer swimsuits so expensive.

Every summer women in changing rooms around the country wonder why they feel compelled to pay hundreds of dollars for a suit that covers just a few inches of skin.

But designer Melissa Odabash explains to MailOnline that engineering a swimsuit is every bit as challenging as a shirt or dress.

Quality over quantity: High-end designers claim that their more expensive pieces such as the $203 Shimmi bikini modeled by Miranda Kerr, are justified because they use better material and tailoring

'It can take up to five machines to make
one swimsuit and the fabric costs the same amount as clothing fabric,' she says.

Swimsuits are like lingerie  - except that, unlike underwear, designers also have to make sure that it holds up 
while running into waves and jumping off diving boards. Creating a garment that looks great and stands up to salt, sand and chlorine presents additional design challenges.

'We’re working on a small canvas, so it’s more challenging to 
create a suit that feels good and … is innovative and fashion-forward,' swimwear designer Karla Colletto tells Slate.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that cheap 
swimsuits fall apart after one season, while higher-priced ones are 
built to last. But is this true?

'The fabric in high end swimwear lasts,'
Ms Odabash says. 'A lot of cheap swimwear 
companies either don't line [swimsuits], or do a straight stitch, which 
is faster to sew.' 

She adds: 'We do self lining which means the outside fabric is the same as the inside lining, and use very expensive hardware that goes through testing to make sure it does not change.'

Then there is the spandex factor. The stretchy staple fabric remains more expensive than, for example, the sturdy 
nylon or cotton used in men’s swimwear. And smaller designers can't negotiate the same bulk manufacturer discounts as discount megastores like Target and H&M.

But when shopping strictly based on fabric it can tough to spot the difference between the low and high end bikinis - especially when shopping online.

Dolce & Gabbana's black bikini, priced at $330 has a triangle top made of 85per cent polyamide, and 15per cent elastane - which are fancy European words for 'nylon' and 'spandex'. The briefs have a ratio of 82 to 18per cent.

Contrast this with Target's Mossimo triangle 
bikini, priced at $9.98 for the top and $13.98 for the bottom - also 
also constructed from 82per cent nylon and 18per cent spandex.

According to the NPD Group, the global 
swimwear industry is now worth $13.25 billion annually, and the average 
American woman owns four swimsuits.

But smaller labels may only have a short window of time to get the garments manufactured and shipped back to the States to make a sale, which also adds to production costs.  

'I think being in a swimsuit 
is daunting enough - women want to feel confident that everything will
be held in place, lifted and not loose'

Marshal Cohen, chief fashion analyst at the NPD Group, told the New York Times that selling bikini tops and bottoms separately, rather than as a matched set, is more expensive for designers.

'A fifty dollar suit has become a seventy dollar suit,' he said.

As with couture clothes, shoppers are a high-end designer's expertise - and because they believe that feeling beautiful on the beach is worth the investment. 

'I think being in a swimsuit or a bikini 
is daunting enough and women want to feel confident that everything will
be held in place, lifted and not loose,' Ms Odabash says. 

'It's well 
worth spending on good quality, [and] it will be actually cheaper in the long 
run.'
