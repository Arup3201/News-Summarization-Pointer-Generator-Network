A driver fined £3,500 for drink-driving has asked the court to give him a lighter sentence – because he has a licence which allows him to consume alcohol.

The Canadian man made the plea to the Appeal Court in Abu Dhabi yesterday.

The man was previously convicted by Abu Dhabi First Instance Court of recklessly driving under the influence of alcohol and destroying public property.

He was ordered to pay 20,000 United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED).

He appeared before the Appeal Court yesterday where he admitted that he was guilty of drink driving and apologised for his actions.

But he also told the court he should not be punished so harshly since he has a licence which allows him to buy alcohol in the UAE.

He said: 'I would like to apologise to the court for what I did. 

'I made a mistake when I drove a car after drinking alcohol.

'I will never do it again and I am asking the court to give me a lighter sentence.'

The man also gave a copy of his alcohol licence to the judge and told him: 'I did not consume the alcohol illegally.'

He added that since he has a licence to drink alcohol in the UAE he hoped his sentence will be reduced.

The man asked the court in Abu Dhabi (pictured) to give him a lesser sentence for drink-driving as he has a licence to consume alcohol in the UAE- but authorities say that does not mean he is allowed to drink-drive

Presiding judge Chief Justice Dr Khairi Al Kabbash told the man that having a licence for alcohol does not give him the right to drink-drive.

The Appeal Court have adjourned the hearing until December 8.
