Paedophile: Hundreds where abused by Jimmy Savile in hospitals, including one girl so desperate to avoid him she threw herself off a bridge

A child repeatedly abused by Jimmy Savile from the age of nine was so desperate to avoid being visited by the paedophile she cycled off a bridge.

The girl fell 15ft and broke her arm but said the DJ still tracked her down and sexually assaulted her again as she recovered in a Leeds hospital.

She was so traumatised by Savile's repeated abuse she avoided treatment for a large birthmark on her face in case the star found her, and instead tried to wash it off at home with bleach.

The unnamed woman is one of more than 500 victims who were attacked by Savile, considered Britain's worst ever paedophile, who died at 84 in 2011 having never been brought to justice.

Today 28 NHS trusts published reports revealing how their patients and staff were habitually abused by Savile.

Some ignored complaints and even gave him keys, private rooms and access to basements where he could grope or even rape his victims.

In other cases staff also agreed to move people from their beds to his accommodation, where he abused them.

At Leeds General Infirmary Savile himself was also made chief porter while working as a DJ, giving him access to all patients.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has today apologised on behalf of the Government and the NHS for letting down the victims and David Cameron’s official spokesman said the report findings are ‘deeply shocking and underline why it’s important that lessons are learnt.’ 

The girl who cycled off a bridge said Savile targeted her because she was disfigured, and used her to boost his own profile.

On one occasion she was picked up in his Rolls Royce and taken for laser surgey at St James' Hospital in Leeds.

'Savile began to kiss my port-wine stain. He nuzzled into my neck and put his hand up my skirt,' she told The Sun.

Over three years he continued to abuse her, even after she jumped from the Yorkshire bridge.

She said: 'Again he kissed and slavered over me. I knew I couldn't stop him." She ended treatment telling her parents: "I'd rather live with my birthmark".'

Today's reports also revealed that Savile also 'interfered' with the dead.  

Witnesses who helped investigators boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass eyes he removed from their bodies, it was revealed today.

The sick paedophile also gloated to others that he enjoyed 'posing' the corpses and that he would 'wheel them around' at night at Leeds General Infirmary.

The astonishing and macabre crimes were revealed in a mass of NHS reports into his crimes published today.

Investigators discovered the DJ and Top of the Pops presenter claimed at least 103 victims aged between five and 75.

They detailed his 50 year reign of terror at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital.
