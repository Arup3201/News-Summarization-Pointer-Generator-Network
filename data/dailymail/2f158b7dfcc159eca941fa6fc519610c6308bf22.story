The founder of Tesla Motors has said the batteries used by Boeing in its Dreamliner aircraft are 'inherently unsafe' - after it emerged that an airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded.

Boeing was placed under increasing pressure today after it emerged the plane manufacturer knew of previous problems with the batteries.

All Nippon Airways (ANA) said it 
had to replace the batteries on its 787 aircraft ten times because they failed 
to charge properly or showed other problems.

Concerns: All Nippon Airways (ANA) said today it had replaced batteries on its 787 aircraft 10 times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems, and informed Boeing about the swaps

Damaged: The singed battery case from the Japan Airlines (JAL) Boeing 787 Dreamliner is displayed inside an investigation lab at the NTSB Headquarters in Washington, DC

Investigation: The state-of-the-art Dreamliners continues to be grounded as the investigation into the cause of the thermal damage continues

And Japan Airlines also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 'on a few occasions'.

ANA said it had informed Boeing about 
the swaps. However, it said it was not required to report the battery
problems to safety regulators because they were not considered a safety 
issue and none of its flights were delayed or cancelled. The incidents 
occurred between May and December last year.

Adding to the pressure on Boeing, U.S. innovator and entrepreneur
Elon Musk, who is the founder of Tesla car company, told British 
aerospace journal Flight International about the batteries: 'Unfortunately, the pack architecture supplied to 
Boeing is inherently unsafe.'

All 50 of the Boeing 787s in use around 
the world were grounded following two incidents with the batteries earlier this month.

First, there was also a battery fire in a 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport on January 7. Then on January 16, an ANA flight was forced to make an 
emergency landing in Japan when its main battery overheated.

According to the New York Times, ANA 
said in five of the ten replacement batteries the main battery had 
showed a low charge. In three cases, the airline said the main battery 
failed to operate normally.

Japan Airlines spokesman Sze Hunn Yap declined to be more specific on when 
units were replaced or whether these were reported to authorities.

Following the revelations about the previous problems with the batteries, Boeing was today ordered to provide a  full operating history of the batteries used in its 787 Dreamliners.

The National Transportation Safety Board in the U.S. made the request after becoming aware of the previous incidents.

Lithium-ion batteries are prone to overheating and require additional safeguards to prevent fires.

Laura
Brown, a spokeswoman for the US Federal Aviation Administration, said 
in Washington that the agency was checking whether the previous battery 
incidents had been reported by Boeing.

With 17 of the jets, ANA was Boeing's 
launch customer for the technologically advanced airliner. The airline 
has had to cancel hundreds of flights, affecting tens of thousands of 
people, but has sought to minimise disruptions by switching to other 
aircraft as much as possible.

The battery problems experienced by ANA before the emergency landing were first reported by The New York Times.

Japanese
and U.S. investigators looking into the Boeing 787's battery problems 
shifted their attention this week from the battery-maker, GS Yuasa of 
Kyoto, Japan, to the manufacturer of a monitoring system. That company, 
Kanto Aircraft Instrument Co, makes a system that monitors voltage, 
charging and temperature of the lithium-ion batteries.

Yesterday
the U.S National Transportation Safety Board said it was conducting a 
chemical analysis of internal short circuiting and thermal damage of the
battery that caught fire in Boston.

The probe was also analysing data from flight data recorders on the aircraft, the NTSB said on its website.

Incident: A 787 made a landing in Takamatsu after a burning smell was also detected in its cockpit. Both All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines have grounded their entire Dreamliner fleets

Hopes: Visitors admired the first production model of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner when it was unveiled to an audience of several thousand at Boeing's assembly plant in Everett, Washington

Complex: Parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world

Last week Experts from the US National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began disassembled the burnt out battery from the Dreamliner which caught fire in a bid
to discover the cause of the malfunction - but admitted they 
are no closer to reaching a conclusion.

They believe it could hold the key to the technical problem which grounded the entire multi-billion dollar fleet.

The NTSB said its investigation into the incident on January 7 is still in its 'early stages.'

Deborah Hersman, head of the NTSB, 
described the incident in Boston as a 'very serious air safety concern',
and that the body does 'not expect to see fire events onboard 
aircraft,' according to the Telegraph.

Meanwhile, batteries expert George Blomgren, who worked for Eveready for 40 years told CBS news that from what he knows about the incidents on board the Boeing 787s he would 'not fly in a Dreamliner tomorrow.'

'I just wouldn't feel that it was appropriate or safe,' he said.

The NTSB said that despite 
establishing that the lithium-ion device suffered a short circuit it 
still has to 'figure out why these events occurred.'The revelation is more bad news for Boeing as it means the worldwide fleet of Dreamliners remains grounded.

Boeing said lithium ion 
batteries 'best met the performance and design objectives of the 787' 
and that 'based on everything we know at this point, we have not changed
our evaluation,' CBS news reports.

The Dreamliner is the first airliner 
to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries. They charge faster and 
can be better moulded to space-saving shapes compared with other 
aeroplane batteries.

The
battery fire is just one of  a series of problems  - including  two 
fuel leaks, a wiring problem, brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit 
window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched 
three years late.

Mike Sinnett, chief engineer on the 
787, said earlier this month that the plane's batteries have operated through a 
combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault.

He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'.

In a statement today, Boeing said: 'Batteries are a replaceable unit on airplanes, regardless of the technology used. Every day there are on the order of five or six batteries on Boeing airplanes that are removed and replaced - about 2,000 per year. We have an ongoing process to look for opportunities to extend the service life of replaceable units like batteries across our fleet.

'We have not seen 787 battery replacements occurring as a result of safety concerns. The batteries are being returned because our robust protection scheme  ensures that no battery that has been deeply discharged or improperly disconnected can be used. The third highest category for battery returns is exceeding the battery shelf life - this is a fact of life in dealing with batteries; they sometimes expire and must be returned.'
