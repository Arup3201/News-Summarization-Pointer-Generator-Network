Spain's high-class escorts are refusing to have sex with the nation's bankers - until they open up credit lines to cash-strapped families and firms.

Madrid's top-end prostitutes say their indefinite strike will continue until bank employees 'fulfil their responsibility to society' and start offering bigger loans for struggling Spaniards, it has been claimed.

Sneaky bankers were trying to circumvent the protest by claiming to be architects or engineers, the sex-workers said.

Plans: A general strike, like this one in Barcelona in 2010, is taking place across Spain on Thursday in protest against austerity measures

But this was 'not fooling anyone' because, as one escort revealed: 'It has been many years since these professionals could afford rates that start from €300 per hour.'

The capital's largest luxury prostitute trade association, which is reportedly initiating the strike, said: 'We are the only ones with a real ability to pressure the sector.

'We have been on strike for three days now and we don't think they can withstand much more,' added the woman, known as Ana MG.

It said the move came after one of its members, Lucia, pressured a bank employee client to grant a loan by halting her 'sexual services'.

Tough talker: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (left) said he will still pass an austere budget on Friday, the day after thousands will take to the streets as part of a general strike (right)

Mexican website SDPnoticias.com, who was joined by Russia Today in breaking the news which some have claimed is a 'hoax', reported that the bankers became so desperate they called in the government for mediation.

The strikes also come as Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy promised this week to stick to a tough budget.

This was despite a surprise setback in
 a regional election he had hoped would reinforce his mandate for 
spending cuts to improve public finances.    

His PP party won the Socialist 
stronghold of Andalucia in Sunday's vote but did not secure the outright
 majority that was expected and that would have reinforced his mandate 
to make savings.

But Rajoy said he would still present a tough 2012 budget for this year on Friday.   

He must set out how Spain will cut the public deficit to 5.3% of its output this year, from 8.51% last year.

'We will pass a very, very austere budget,' he told reporters in South Korea, where he was attending a nuclear summit.    

Rajoy's reforms have won some public 
support from voters who want to make sure Spain is not forced to ask for
 a bailout like neighbouring Portugal.

The sex-worker strike comes as Spain is 
set to be hit by a general strike on Thursday in protest at high 
unemployment and changes to labour laws that make it cheaper for firms 
to lay off workers.

Train, bus and air traffic will be severely limited as unions, which represent one in five Spanish workers, agreed to retain minimum transport services.

It will mean only 20 per cent of flights between Spanish and other European airports.

The government's labour market reform is just the latest in a series of measures Spain has taken in the last two years to try to make its economy more competitive.    

Doubts about Spain's public finances have pushed up the state's borrowing costs, forcing the government to drastically cut spending to reduce the public deficit.

At the same time, unemployment has soared to a staggering 23 per cent and the economy is heading into its second recession in three years.    

A general strike in 2010 had limited impact - mostly on transport and manufacturing - but this week's walkout could bring a bigger turnout because the jobless rate has increased significantly.    

Also, in 2010 the Socialists were in power, and now the centre-right People's Party is in office.

Traditionally, the unions have had a political alliance with the Socialists so protests have been more muted during periods of Socialist rule.     

In a country where people depend heavily on public transport to get to work, the unions depend on cutting transport services to obtain maximum impact from a strike.
