Hundreds of asylum seekers are being put up at two more seaside hotels at the expense of the taxpayer as the Home Office struggles with the latest influx of immigrants.

Coachloads of migrants have been taken to Bournemouth, Dorset, where they are being given taxpayer-funded beds and three meals a day at two hotels.

More than 88 are staying at the three-star Roundhouse Hotel and 67 are being accommodated at the three-star Heathlands Hotel.

The wave of immigrants arriving from Calais is causing 'overcrowding' issues at detention centres in London

Earlier this week it emerged that 130 asylum seekers were staying at the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent, close to the Port of Dover.

The wave of immigrants arriving from Calais is causing 'overcrowding' issues at detention centres in the London area, so hundreds are being moved into hotels on the coast.

The Home Office is using Britannia hotel group to temporarily house the latest flood of asylum seekers looking to escape war-torn areas of Africa and the Middle East.

Despite the holiday season coming to an end weeks ago both the Bournemouth hotels, which charge between £50 to £160 a night for a double room, are fully booked this weekend.

At least 67 are being accommodated at the three-star Heathlands Hotel in Bournemouth

Conor Burns, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West, said the asylum seekers were part of a group of 800 that were being housed in a hotel in Croydon, but were now being dispersed to other locations.

He said the group had been moved into the area by Clearsprings, a company employed by the Home Office to 'provide ready accommodation services' for people.

He said: 'I am very concerned by this.

'I will be talking to the Minister for Immigration to make sure Bournemouth is not a targeted destination for asylum seekers in the future.

'This is not ideal. I would have preferred they weren't there. But I have been assured these are exceptional circumstances.'

Tobias Ellwood, the Tory MP for Bournemouth East, claimed the asylum seekers were being chaperoned by police, although there is no obvious police presence at either hotel.

He said: 'I am seeking assurances that this isn't the thin end of the wedge. We need to make sure this is orchestrated in a safe and secure manner.'

John Beesley, the leader of Bournemouth Borough Council, said: 'We have been informed by the Home Office that they were accommodating a number of asylum seekers in the town due to overcrowding in London.

'The Home Office has made it very clear to us that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short term measure and have reassured us that it will be for no more than two weeks.

'We are meeting with Home Office officials early next week to discuss the matter further.'

The asylum seekers will not have access to local statutory services such as schools and social services while they are in Bournemouth.

A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The UK has a proud history of offering sanctuary to those who need it.

'We have made clear to our providers that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term measure.'

Staff at the three star Roundhouse Hotel claimed they were not aware of any asylum seekers at the hotel while a spokesman at the Heathlands Hotel said they would not comment on the issue.
