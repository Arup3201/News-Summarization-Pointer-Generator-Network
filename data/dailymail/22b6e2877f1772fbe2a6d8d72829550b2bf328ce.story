Andres Iniesta and Co touched down in Brazil as Spain look to keep their title of world champions.

Iniesta - goalscoring hero in 2010's final - was joined by injury doubt Diego Costa and stars such as Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique in strolling through Alfonso Pena airport.

Wet weather welcomed the world champions to the southeastern city of Curitiba, where Spain will be based throughout the tournament.

Leading the charge: Pepe Reina and Andres Iniesta stroll through Alfonso Pena airport

Spain open their defence against Holland - a repeat of the 2010 final - on Friday in Salvador, with Chile and Australia also opponents in Group B.

Players and staff were whisked straight from the plane into an awaiting bus, which then took the team to their hotel and training facility at local club Atletico Paranaense, on the outskirts of the city.

Unlike in South Africa four years ago when banners and flags welcomed their arrival, there were no indications that the World Cup holders were in Curitiba, apart from signs at the training facility.

But Spain will look to extend their monopoly on major tournaments for which they are eligible - the last time they did not win the World Cup or European Championship was 2006.
