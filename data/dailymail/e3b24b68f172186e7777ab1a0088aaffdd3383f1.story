A woman was left horrified after she stumbled across a family of bears cooling off in her swimming pool.

The three enormous bears sneaked into the back yard in North Naples, Florida, and took a leisurely dip in the outdoor pool.

TJ Ozbay fled inside when she spotted the huge creatures lounging in her garden after they broke through screen fencing - before recording the ordeal on her mobile phone.

The bears roamed around the garden for almost an hour leaving the homeowner fearing for her life indoors.

Black bears are found in most parts of North America and despite being less dangerous to humans than their bigger grizzly cousins - adults can still weigh up to 550lbs.

Between 1900 and 1980 23 fatalities were reported caused by black bear attacks.

Speaking to NBC2 (WBBH-TV), she said: 'I think it was the sound of the hose that attracted them in to my garden.

Luckily the bears moved on without incident and authorities are deciding whether to set traps to stop them coming back

'I closed all of the doors and the curtains and ran inside. I told the bears to get out of here - go away I said, don't come inside. It was very, very scary.'

A panicked TJ called the emergency services to report the surprise visitors after one of the bears came up to the sliding glass door she was hiding behind.

She told the operator: 'There are three bears on my balcony. They are trying to get in to my house. I'm so scared - they're trying to break through my window.'
