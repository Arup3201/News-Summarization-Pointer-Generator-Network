A woman who had a five-year relationship with J.D. Salinger starting in 1949 and waited 60 years to discuss her time with the reclusive author is finally spilling her secrets.

After the author's death in 2010, Jean Miller finally opened up about the relationship to filmmaker Shane Salerno, who has made a soon-to-be released documentary on Salinger.

Miller was just 14 when she began the relationship with the secretive Salinger and the flow of such revelations has gone from trickle to flood thanks to the upcoming film and a new biography.

Revealed: It has now been revealed that Jean Miller discussed her relationship with reclusive author JD Salinger in 2010 after keeping silent for 60 years

Recluse: Many new revelations about J.D. Salinger have come out of a new documentary and biography about the author, including details of his relationship with Jean Miller, which began when she was 14

According to CBS, Miller’s silence was a sort prerequisite to being a friend of Salinger’s.

‘I didn't want to talk about it because I knew [Salinger] didn't want me to talk about it,’ she said in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning.

Miller opened up about Salinger, for the first time since she last saw him 60 years before, to Salerno after the author’s death.

Among the intimate revelations—descriptions of Salinger’s spiritual nature and how deeply affected he was by WWII—was the disclosure that Miller had been just 14 when she met Salinger.

Miller says the two met at a Daytona Beach, Florida Sheraton hotel. Salinger was 30.

‘I was sitting at a pool, I was reading Wuthering Heights. And he said, “How is Heathcliff?"’

Despite warnings from her mother, Miller continued the relationship, which consisted of long walks on the beach and the exchange of many letters.

For five years, the friendship blossomed. Then, the two had sex for the first time and Miller would only see Salinger once more for the rest of her life.

‘I saw this glass curtain come down, and I just knew it was all over,’ she said.

But she still remembers him fondly.

‘He wanted to go below the surface of your life,’ Miller said. ‘Jerry Salinger would say to me, a young girl, “Do you believe in God?” No adult had ever talked to me [like that]. Not only that, no adult had ever listened to me.

‘He once said to me, “If you ever lose track of me, just read my stories."’

The authors of a new J.D. Salinger 
biography are claiming they have cracked one of publishing's greatest 
mysteries: What 'The Catcher in the Rye' novelist was working on during 
the last half century of his life.

The
new book and related film will be released next week and they both 
claim that the novelist instructed his estate to release at least five 
new books.

Some of the work is brand-new, while other volumes extend existing stories and characters.

Starting between 2015 and 2020, a series of posthumous Salinger releases are planned, according to Salinger, co-written by David Shields and Shane Salerno and scheduled to be published Sept. 3.

Salerno's documentary on the author opens Sept. 6. In January, it will air on PBS as an installment of 'American Masters.'

Providing
by far the most detailed report of previously unreleased material, the 
book's authors cite 'two independent and separate sources' who they say 
have 'documented and verified' the information.

One
of the Salinger books would center on Catcher protagonist Holden 
Caulfield and his family, including a revised version of an early, 
unpublished story The Last and Best of the Peter Pans.

Other volumes would draw on Salinger's World War II years and his immersion in Eastern religion.

A
publication called The Family Glass would feature additional stories 
about the Glass family of Franny and Zooey and other Salinger works.

Salinger does not identify a prospective
publisher. Spokesman Terry Adams of Little, Brown and Company, which 
released Catcher and Salinger's three other books, declined to comment 
Sunday.

Salinger's son, Matt Salinger, who helps run the author's literary estate, was not immediately available for comment. If the books do appear, they may well not be through Little, Brown.

In the mid-1990s, Salinger agreed to allow a small Virginia-based press, Orchises, to issue his novella Hapworth 16, 1924, which first appeared in The New Yorker in 1965.

But after news leaked of the planned publication, Salinger changed his mind and Hapworth was canceled.

No Salinger book came out after the early 1960s, as the author increasingly withdrew from public life.

Over the past 50 years, there has been endless and conflicting speculation over what Salinger had been doing during his self-imposed retirement. That Salinger continued to write is well documented.

Friends, neighbors and family members all reported that Salinger was writing in his final years and the author himself told The New York Times in 1974 that he wrote daily, though only for himself.

'There is a marvelous peace in not publishing,' he said at the time.

But there is no consensus on what he 
was writing and no physical evidence of what Salinger had reportedly 
stashed in a safe in his home in Cornish, N.H.

The
Salinger estate, run partly by Matt Salinger and Salinger's widow, 
Colleen O'Neill, has remained silent on the subject since the author's 
death in January 2010.

The two did not cooperate with Salerno and Shields. Until now, neither Salerno nor Shields has been defined by his expertise on Salinger.

Salerno is a Hollywood screenwriter whose credits include Armageddon, the Oliver Stone film Savages and a planned sequel to James Cameron's blockbuster Avatar.

Shields is an award-winning author whose books include the novel Dead Languages; a nonfiction work on pro basketball that was a National Book Critics Circle prize finalist; and Reality Hunger, a self-described 'manifesto' for modern literature.

Their 700-page Salinger biography has new information well beyond any possible posthumous fiction.

Nine years in the making and thoroughly documented, Salinger features many rare photographs and letters, unprecedented detail about the author's World War II years and brief first marriage, and a revelatory interview with the former teenage girl, Jean Miller, who inspired his classic story For Esme - With Love and Squalor.

It also has an account of how Salinger, who supposedly shunned Hollywood for much of his life, nearly agreed to allow Esme to be adapted into a feature film.

Salinger both fleshes out and 
challenges aspects of the author's legend. He is portrayed as deeply 
traumatized by his war experiences and stunned by his post-'Catcher' 
fame.

But he also 
comes off as far less reclusive and detached than long believed. He does
agree to the occasional interview, even initiating discussion with The 
New York Times, and appears sensitive to his public image.

His
affinity for young people is not confined to his books, and Salinger's 
biographers closely track his history of intense attachments to teens, 
from Oona O'Neill in the 1940s to Joyce Maynard in the 1970s.

The
book is structured as an oral history, featuring hundreds of new and 
old interviews, excerpts from newspaper accounts and previous 
biographies and commentary from Shields and Salerno.

Those
quoted range from Salinger's children to authors Tom Wolfe and Gore 
Vidal to Mark David Chapman, who cited Catcher as a reason he murdered 
John Lennon in 1980.

Salerno has been promising to make headlines ever since announcing the biography and film shortly after Salinger's death.

Earlier
this year, he quickly arranged lucrative deals with the Weinstein Co. 
for a feature film, the producers of 'American Masters' for TV rights 
and Simon & Schuster for the book.

The
filmmaker himself has proved as effective as Salinger at keeping a 
secret, with only a handful of people even knowing of the project's 
existence during Salinger's lifetime.

Fame: Salinger was an international celebrity before becoming reclusive

Salerno spent some $2 million of his own money and traveled throughout the U.S. and Europe in search of material.

He is also adept at revealing secrets, with recent stories by The Associated Press and other media outlets, featuring photographs never previously published.

Salinger never authorized a biography, but several unauthorized books have come out over the past 30 years, notably one by Ian Hamilton.

In 1987, Salinger successfully blocked release of Hamilton's 'J.D. Salinger: A Writer's Life,' citing the use of previously unpublished letters. Hamilton described his legal battle in 'Searching for J.D. Salinger,' published in 1988.
