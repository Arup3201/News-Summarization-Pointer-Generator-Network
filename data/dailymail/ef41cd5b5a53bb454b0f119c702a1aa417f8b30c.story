One 911 operator saved her own father from going into diabetic shock on her very first day working alone on the job.

Earlier that Monday, Crystal Morrow of Dekalb County, Georgia answered approximately 40 emergency phone calls including one about a house fire and another about a burglary.

When Morrow's next phone call was the sound of her worried aunt on the other line saying that Morrow's father was in diabetic shock, she knew she had to remain calm and do her job.

Fox News reports that Morrow calmly helped her aunt get an ambulance for her father despite her own turbulent emotions.

'I did freeze, my hands froze over the keyboard, but I knew I had to get the call in,' says Morrow.

Morrow's aunt, Gail Morrow, was in so much shock she didn't even know it was her niece on the other line reports ABC.

Morrow said that the only way she was able to stay calm was through her fantastic training as a 911 phone dispatcher.

'Because of so many people being in the room, I didn’t think that I would get the call and it’s crazy that I got it on the very first day,' said the operator to Yahoo News.

Ms. Morrow's colleague Danielle Harvey told yahoo that trainees are taught how to take calls from their family members on their first day of the job.

'She handled it well. She took the entire call. She got up after it was over and went out. So I checked on her and told her to go see about her family,' Harvey told the station.

Morrow says she has Harvey to thank for her successful operator call.

'She’s very detailed and she wouldn’t let me sink. So, I am very thankful,' Morrow said.

Harvey did such a great job of training her staff to handle even the most stressful situation and she has been nominated for the national Smart Telecommunicator award.
