Barring a late injury scare, Gareth Bale is all set to join an elite list of Britons plying their trade abroad to line up in a Champions League final.

It's a monumental moment for the Real Madrid winger, who has enjoyed a season to surpass the expectations of most after his Â£86million world-record transfer from Tottenham.

Twenty-one goals later and Bale is really showing why the club splurged so much money on him in September.

The 24-year-old is ready to start for Carlo Ancelotti's side against city rivals Atletico in Lisbon on Saturday night and here, Sportsmail looks at the seven other Brits abroad who've had the pleasure of playing in Europe's showpiece fixture.

Inspiration: Paul Lambert (challenging Didier Deschamps) was superb for Dortmund in the 1997 final against Italian giants Juventus

Paul Lambert - Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus (1997)

The Scotland man bossed midfield for Dortmund during his solitary season in Germany and immediately became a cult hero with supporters.

Not hard to see why really. The Aston Villa boss assisted one of the goals and nullified the threat of a certain Zinedine Zidane, who was just starting to become a real influence on the world stage.

Lambert is still talked about over there. In typical straight-talking style, he said: 'I gave the shirts I swapped with the Juventus players after the game to my dad,' he reflected. 'But he's a roof-tiler, wore them to work and they're ripped to pieces. As for the medals, they're round the house somewhere, I don't know where.

'But all the experience that came with winning them is up here [in the mind].'

Steve McManaman - Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia (2000)

Definitely a midfielder whose talents have now been largely forgotten, but McManaman in his pomp - the run up to his move to Real Madrid and immediately after - was one of the country's more frightening wingers.

And he can lay claim to having scored in a European Cup final. Operating centrally, McManaman was at his sublime best. The goal was a stunning volley

Madrid swept Valencia aside at the Stade de France, and it was in part down to the brilliance of the Scouse lad they signed from Liverpool a year beforehand.

That's about as good as it got for him. Absurd really that McManaman never truly kicked on after that night in Paris.

What a hit! Steve McManaman scored a super volley and was named man of the match against Valencia

That was the one: The Liverpudlian enjoyed his finest night in football at the Stade de France in May 2000

Owen Hargreaves - Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 pens) (2001)

One of those nights where the English press stood up and wondered who this scrawny midfielder - eligible for the national team - was, completely bossing a Bayern Munich midfield.

Next to the legendary Stefan Effenberg, keen to banish the nightmare final moments of the 1999 final against Manchester, Hargreaves shone.

He had been key in the semi-final win against Real Madrid weeks previously, while the Canadian went on to star at the World Cup in 2002 for Sven-Goran Eriksson.

Coming of age: Owen Hargreaves was exceptional for Bayern Munich in their run to the 2001 final

Steve Archibald - Barcelona 0-0 Steaua Bucharest (0-2 pens) (1986)

Joined Barcelona in 1984 from Tottenham and Archibald started brightly at the Nou Camp. By the time 1986 came around, he wasn't a regular but did play in the final under Terry Venables.

Archibald played a key role in defending from the front in the goalless draw but had been substituted before the penalty shootout.

Laurie Cunningham - Real Madrid 0-1 Liverpool (1981)

Cunningham is one of the most exciting players to have ever graced the English game, tragically dying in a car accident while at Ray Vallecano in 1989.

The winger started his career at Leyton Orient but truly made his name at West Brom before a move to Real Madrid.

He was electric for the Spanish giants, but - on the biggest club stage of them all - Cunningham wasn't able to impact on the final.

A shame: Steve Archibald wasn't able to add a European Cup winners' medal during his Barcelona career

Struggle: Laurie Cunningham (tackled by Liverpool's Graeme Souness) wasn't able to impact upon the final

Chris Waddle - Marseille 0-0 Red Star Belgrade (3-5 pens) (1991)

You could hardly blame him, but when offered the opportunity to step up for Marseille in the final's penalty shootout, Waddle turned it down.

After all, it was under a year since that night in Turin when the former Sheffield Wednesday midfielder blindingly smashed over the crossbar at the 1990 World Cup.

Kevin Keegan - Hamburg 0-1 Nottingham Forest (1980)

His final season over in Germany almost looked like ending perfectly, but Hamburg inexplicably came unstuck against Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest.

Keegan - much like the favourites - never got going at the Bernabeu and left the club for Southampton that summer.

He knew the final was to be his last game, but still it ended in a damp squib.

Head in hands moment: Chris Waddle watched his Marseille side lose on penalties at the end of the 1991 final
