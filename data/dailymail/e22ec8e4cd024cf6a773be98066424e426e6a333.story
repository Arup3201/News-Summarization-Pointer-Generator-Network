David Warner riled India with his words and willow, vowing he won't curtail the verbals as Australia claimed a 363-run lead at stumps on day four of the first Test.

Warner scored a second century in the match, swapping barbs with Indians Varun Aaron, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan during a heated Friday at Adelaide Oval.

As the ball clattered into the stumps, Aaron celebrated by yelling out 'c'mon!' to his team-mates.

After three days of great respect between Australia and India, traditional hostilities which have marked recent matches between the two nations, have resumed on day four of the first cricket Test after David Warner reacted to being bowled by a no-ball from young paceman Varun Aaron

Warner taunted the bowler again when he let the next ball pass through with another audible and sarcastic 'c'mon'.

But a review of the dismissal found he had over-stepped and the umpires called Warner back to the middle. The first innings centurion looked directly at the fast bowler and mouthed 'c'mon' on several occasions.

Tempers flared, with non-striker Shane Watson also becoming involved as other Indian players chastised Warner for his reaction.

The umpires were forced to intervene and asked them all to cool down.

'The world knows that I like to get involved and that's how I play my cricket. I take it to them. If I have to be a bit verbal I will,' Warner said after scoring 102 as Australia progressed to 5-290 in their second innings.

'Sometimes I cross the line, though I try not to.

'I don't know if the temperature got to 40 degrees plus, but I think it was getting to a few people out there.

'It happens.'

Ajinkya Rahane insisted there was no bad blood between his side and Warner.

'It's going to happen and it's really good for the game,' Rahane said.

Warner was dropped on 89, while Aaron was gobsmacked when a leg-side caught behind appeal was turned down with the opener on 70.

It was all the more frustrating for the visitors, given Warner had been bowled by Aaron on 66 in the 34th over.

Peacemaker. India captain Virat Kohli does his best to diffuse the situation between David Warner and Varun Aaron at the Adelaide Oval

'C'mon'. David Warner has a mid-pitch discussion with Indian captain Virat Kohli after he was recalled on a no-ball dismissal by young paceman Varun Aaron

The express paceman, no-doubt a little testy after part-timers Murali Vijay and Rohit Sharma were thrown the ball before him, gave Warner a send-off.

Replays showed Aaron overstepped so Warner was recalled, prompting the pugnacious batsman to return serve.

Shane Watson, Kohli and Dhawan all joined the ruckus before umpire Ian Gould eventually brokered peace.

Virat Kohli hit on the helmet by Mitchell Johnson on day three which saw the entire Australian team rush in to check on the welfare of the Indian skipper

There was another spotfire in the third session, an unrealistic lbw appeal from Rohit Sharma triggering a kerfuffle involving Smith and Kohli.

'When things don't go your way, you sort of get the adrenaline up,' Warner said of the opposition.

'There are a few send-offs here and there ... that's cricket.'

Mitchell Johnson was consoled by Australian captain Michael Clarke after striking his Indian counterpart with a short delivery. But the spirit of cricket has been tested on day four as both sides exchanged words in the middle

Discussion at Adelaide Oval otherwise turned from Michael Clarke's degenerative discs to the timing of his declaration.

Clarke was dismissed for seven, but he dived for a catch while fielding and looked sprightly compared to when his chronic back injury flared up on day one.

Despite initial fears the skipper's summer could be over, he is now well placed to be a surprise starter in the second Test.

'Never been more proud!' David appeared to be lifting his cap and his bat to the skies in memory of Phillip Hughes, in the photo Candice posted on her Instagram after  his second century on Friday

Before that decision is made, Clarke must resolve when to call his teammates in.

'We've got 98 overs tomorrow, we've got to try and hussle through our overs to try and take 10 wickets,' Warner said.

The highest victorious fourth-innings Test total at the venue was Australia's 6-315 in 1902.

India scored 445 in a loss almost 40 years ago in Adelaide, while South Africa's stonewall in the epic 2012 draw will be in the forefront of Clarke's mind.

Offspinner Nathan Lyon finished with first-innings figures of 5-134, flighting the ball and attacking the rough created by Ishant Sharma's footmarks.

'He was hitting it (the rough) virtually every delivery. That's going to be the key for us,' Warner said.

The most recent five-wicket haul by an Australian tweaker in a home Test against India came from Bob Simpson in 1968.
