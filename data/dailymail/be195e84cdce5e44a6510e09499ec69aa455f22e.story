A 15-year-old suspect is in custody after shooting a male student at random on the first day of classes at a high school near Baltimore, police said.

A 17-year-old Perry Hall High School student was flown to a hospital after being shot in the back Monday morning, Baltimore County police said.

Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson said at a news conference Monday afternoon that officers believed that the shooter, who was also a student at Perry Hall High School, fired at random and struck the teen.

The victim, who has not been identified, is in critical condition, according to a hospital spokeswoman.

Johnson says the shooter took out a 
weapon he had hidden when teachers and a school resource officer 
immediately rushed him. Johnson said a second shot was fired. The 
shooter was quickly subdued.

Johnson says the shooter acted alone. Police found the weapon he used but would not say what it was.

The suspect fired a first shot at 10.45am, a second shot was fired as teachers grabbed him, Johnson said.

Students have said that the suspect was tackled by two teachers, who pinned him against a vending machine.

Some students, who witnessed the chaos, said that there was a scuffle right before the shooting.

'I heard two large bangs and I saw people running and it was chaos and everybody ran outside, and the principal told us to stay in the grass area and away from the cafeteria,' a student told WJZ.

Miranda Wienecke, a junior, told the Baltimore Sun that she saw the suspect with a 'huge black thing' that she suddenly realised was a gun.

'I saw people getting under the table,' Wienecke said.'Then I saw people running. We heard this huge boom, then there was another one, everything happened very fast.'

Parents have told WJZ that there may 
have been a threat on Facebook which referenced the school. It 
reportedly said, ‘First Day of School, Last Day of Life.’

Mike Koogle, a senior who was down the hall when the shooting happened, said that a teacher started calling ‘lockdown’ before the school’s secretary got on the PA system and said, ‘We are in code red. We are in code red.'

Koogle said that he and his fellow students were terrified, ran into a classroom, turned off the lights and hid.

Police say a suspect was taken into custody after the shooting but did not provide additional details.

There are also reports that the shooting could have stemmed from bullying incidents. About 2,300 attend the high school.
