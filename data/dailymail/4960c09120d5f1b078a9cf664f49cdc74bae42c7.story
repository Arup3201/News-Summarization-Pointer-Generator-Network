Studio 10 host Sarah Harris and her husband Tom Ward have purchased a luxurious four-bedroom home on the affluent north shore of Sydney.

The couple paid $2,175,000 for the stunning property in Cremorne, $75,000 above the reserve.

The totally renovated house was sold amid a flurry of auctions on Saturday - dubbed Super Saturday - which saw a record 800 properties go under the hammer, reports Domain.

All four bedrooms offer built-in wardrobes and high ceilings, while two offer balconies. The main bedroom balcony overlooks the reserve.

The 33-year-old presenter tied the knot with IT specialist Tom Ward in July.Though they're now based in North Sydney, Harris grew up on the other side of the city.

The bubbly blonde grew up in Sydney's western suburbs, in a housing commission home in Mount Druitt, the eldest daughter of a single mother who gave birth just one week after her 18th birthday.

As well as hosting the Channel Ten morning program, she is poised to present new reality series Shark Tank, which puts inventors in front of potential monied investors. 

In December, Harris spoke to news.com.au about her newfound longing for motherhood.

'I always thought I'd like kids one day, but it has become quite primal. It's almost like my ovaries are aching for a child,' Harris said.

'I always had this small fear when it comes to babies, thinking about my career and juggling taking time off.' 

But Harris revealed she is now assured she can make it work.

This month, Harris revealed a series of knockbacks in the past had left her second guessing her career.

'A few years back, I was told I didn't have a future in presenting and should focus on something else,' she told news.com.au.

But the 33-year-old said these professional hurdles were the very catalyst for where she is now.

'Sometimes it takes not getting what you want to get what you need,' she said.
