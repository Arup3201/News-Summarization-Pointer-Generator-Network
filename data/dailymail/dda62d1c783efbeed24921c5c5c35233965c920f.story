Attack: Maxine Peake on Silk, accused of backing 'fat cat lawyers'

The BBC has been plunged into a row over political bias after one of its popular dramas was apparently used as a platform to criticise Government policy.

Tory MPs are furious that BBC1 courtroom drama Silk – which has more than five million viewers – has taken a stance against proposals to cut the legal aid bill, which currently costs taxpayers £2 billion a year.

The row was sparked by last Monday night’s episode, when one of the show’s characters delivered a strongly worded attack on plans by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to trim costs by £220 million a year.

Barrister Caroline Warwick QC, played by Frances Barber, said: ‘I am sick and tired of being exhausted because there is no legal aid for juniors, which means I stay up all night every night working on complex trials only to be told I’m a fat cat by a government full of the fattest cats in the history of fatness.’

The cost of legal aid led to accusations that ‘fat cat’ lawyers are enriching themselves at the taxpayers’ expense.

But some leading legal figures  say the cuts will see the less well-off lose access to justice.

Both Maxine Peake, who stars as the show’s campaigning  barrister Martha Costello, and Peter Moffat, its writer and creator, have taken part in protest marches against the reforms.

On Friday, Miss Peake and Moffat – a former barrister – launched a fresh assault on the policy when they appeared on BBC Breakfast to talk about  the decision to end Silk after three series.

Peake wore a Save Legal Aid badge during the interview and Moffat described the proposed cuts as ‘deep and savage’.

Bob Neill, the Conservative vice-chairman and MP for Bromley and Chislehurst, said he would be raising his concerns with the BBC Trust tomorrow.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘While Maxine and Peter are both keen advocates of the legal profession any personal views that they have relating to this matter are separate from the drama, characters and the BBC.’
