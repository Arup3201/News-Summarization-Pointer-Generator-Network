Australia's most decorated canine war hero, who was at one stage missing in action for nearly 14 months in Afghanistan, has lost her battle with brain cancer.

Sarbi, who worked as an explosive detection dog for the Australian Army, suffered a number of seizures in recent weeks and scans revealed a brain tumour.

The canine, affectionately known as 'the wonder dog', lost her short battle with the terminal illness on Friday, and died surrounded by her loved ones, according to her handler.

Affectionately known as the wonder dog, she was trained as an explosive detective dog

Sarbi's handler, Warrant Officer Class Two David Simpson said she had a 'wonderful life'

'Sarbi had a wonderful life serving Australia as an explosive detection dog and as a pet at home for the last five years,' Warrant Officer Class Two David Simpson said.

'Sarbi will live on in everyone's hearts and minds and I hope that her story of perseverance and determination will inspire you to do whatever you can to achieve your goals and dreams.'

Sarbi was attached to the Australian Special Operations Task Group in 2008, vanishing from the same patrol and in the same action for which Trooper Mark Donaldson was awarded the Victoria Cross.

During the bitter fighting, nine Australian soldiers, including Sarbi's handler, were wounded.

Thirteen months later a US soldier on patrol in the same area spotted a black labrador walking with a local villager, an unusual sight in Afghanistan.

Back at the Australian base at Tarin Kowt, a quick check of the dog's microchip confirmed this was Sarbi.  

Last month, a south-east Queensland dog park was named in her honour

It was then she went missing, but was returned nearly 14 months later after a US soldier on patrol in the same area spotted a black labrador walking with a local villager

For her brave efforts, Sarbi was awarded the War Dog Operational Medal, the Canine Service Medal and RSPCA Purple Cross Award.

The RSPCA Purple Cross recognises animals that have shown outstanding service to humans.

Only eight have been awarded, including that to John Simpson's donkey Murphy, posthumously recognised on behalf of all donkeys who carried wounded soldier on Gallipoli.
