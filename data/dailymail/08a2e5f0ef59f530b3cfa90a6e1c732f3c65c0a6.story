A crafty zebra which had escaped from a circus tried giving police the slip when it used its stripes to blend in with markings on a road.

The animal paused completely motionless in the middle of the junction in Bitburg, Germany.

Drivers were left scratching their heads when they realised they had witnessed a real life zebra crossing.

Despite the animal's camouflage attempt, officers were not fooled and the zebra was taken back to the circus by its keeper.

'Everything went smoothly in the end,' a police spokesman told German newspaper Blid.

A similar incident happened on a motorway in Atlanta in 2010.

A 12-year-old zebra called Lima broke away from trainers before wriggling through an opening and escaping from a circus.

It galloped along and across a busy motorway with police in hot pursuit.
