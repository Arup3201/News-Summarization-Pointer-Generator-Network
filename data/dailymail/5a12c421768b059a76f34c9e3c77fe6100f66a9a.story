A motorist has been caught on camera smashing in to three cars after losing control of his vehicle in a railway station car park.

The inattentive driver was reversing out of a parking space when he suddenly jammed down the accelerator and shot backwards into the other cars.

He promptly left the scene, and police have now launched a public appeal in an attempt to find him after a fruitless search lasting two months so far.

Incident: A silver Ford Escort backs out of a parking space at Olton railway station in the West Midlands

Accelerating: The driver suddenly sped up while performing the simple manoeuvre

The mystery motorist was filmed trying to leave the car park at Olton railway in the West Midlands on September 27.

The 21-second CCTV clip, released this week by British Transport Police, shows the silver Ford tentatively reversing out of its space.

But it suddenly speeds up and strikes three cars, sending one hurtling forwards.

The silver car comes to rest in the car park's zig-zag zone after hitting a safety barrier.

Smash: The Ford scraped past three other cars as it reversed out of the space

Out of control: The car did not slow down even after crashing into the parked vehicles

Reversing cars into and out of parking spaces is considered one of the fundamental motoring skills and often features in driving tests.

Investigating officer Ali Jama said: 'We are now two months on from this incident taking place shortly after 1.20pm on Friday, 27 September.

'Despite extensive inquiries, officers have yet to trace the driver of the silver Ford Escort which collided with three parked cars before the driver left the scene.

'So far, the driver has not reported the incident to police.

Knock: The red car was pushed forwards out of its own parking space

Aftermath: The car came to rest when it smashed into a crash barrier, but it then left the scene

'I am today hoping that someone will recognise the car and/or the driver, and come forward with information which can assist the investigation.

'Unfortunately, the CCTV camera did not capture any part of the vehicle's registration.'

Anyone who has information which they believe can assist the investigation is asked to contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016.
