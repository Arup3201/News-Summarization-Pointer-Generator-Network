Whilst Sarah Jessica Parker may look nothing short of fabulous in her new shoot, she has revealed that in real life she is nothing like her super stylish alter ego Carrie Bradshaw. 

Speaking to Harper's Bazaar Arabia the 49-year-old actress and shoe designer said: 'I’m not an expert on women, on sex, on dating, on romance. I just played one.

'I’m not interrogative that way; it’s not the way I talk to my friends. I have friendships that are intimate and hopefully I have a good ear for them. But I don’t know what general issues are for women.'

SJP wore a number of different looks for the shoot, wearing shoes from her own 'SJP Collection' 

Explaining the she finds it difficult when people expect her to be just like Carrie, Sarah revealed that she does not like to give her friends guidance.

In Sex and The City Carrie had a longstanding column for fictional newspaper The New York Star in which she would proffer her musings on love, life and NYC. 

However, whilst Sarah may not be into doling out advice like Carrie, one thing they definitely have in common is their love of fancy footwear.

In fact, SJP has her own line of shoes and handbags including a 25 piece collection  designed with the help of George Malkemus, CEO of Manolo Blahnik.

The collection even includes a t-bar sandal named after her famous character. Sarah has previously revealed that she wanted the pieces to be simple and that she and George have always shared the same vision.

'There's decades and decades and decades of incredible imagery that you probably have in your head that's meaningful to you. 

'It just so happens that George and I shared the same period of interest,' she said, 'I wanted to go back in time to the simple shoe, which is really hard to do well. That was really our point of inspiration.'

Carrie Bradshaw was known as much for the advice she would give her friends as the outlandish clothing that she would wear 

Sarah Jessica Parker spoke at length in the interview about her love for her family and how difficult it can be to work away from her children

And with the collection, says Sarah, comes great business experience: 'I’ve learned about when things are complicated in business, how best to get a yes,' she revealed to Harper's. 

'How to navigate relationships that are unfriendly, stressful, combative. I’ve learned about private financing and business, and what their expectations are versus a publicly held company and a board. 

However whilst it is clear that Sarah is incredibly successful that doesn't stop her worrying about her family. She and her husband Matthew Broderick, 52, share three young children, James Wilkie, 12, and five-year-old twins Marion and Tabitha.   

SJP, who at the time of the shoot was about to head to Italy for six weeks to shoot All Roads Lead To Rome, said it was difficult to be away from them whilst filming. 

'It’s a really long time to be away from the children and I’m getting a little bit anxious about it,just being gone is the ever-present conflict.

'Someone very clever said to me recently, ‘The only reason you feel guilty is because you enjoy your work’. Perhaps that’s true. I know they’re going to be beyond fine, they’re going to be great, but I worry and I miss them.'

The film is a romantic comedy which sees SJP star as uptight Maggie who travels with her former Italian lover Luca - to be played by Raoul Bova - as they chase her rebellious daughter across Italy.

Parker's own life however is more stable that Maggie's something which she is eternally grateful for.

'I’m proud of my husband. I very much love watching him work,' she said, 'I am extremely attached to my family and I feel lucky that we have found and created this life together. 

'When I think of my husband and children I also think of those that surround us, that we are privileged enough to call friends, they play such an intricate part in our lives. 

To talk about family for me is a wonderful meaningful group and without Matthew I wouldn’t have found that particular group, so I feel very blessed.
