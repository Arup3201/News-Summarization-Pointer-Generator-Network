Kurdish forces drove Islamic State militants back from the oil-rich city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq on Monday, in an attack which was backed by heavy air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition.

Speaking to a local TV channel near the frontline, Kirkuk governor Najmaldin Karim said the purpose of the offensive was to secure the city, which the Kurds have held since last summer.

Peshmerga fighters began shelling Islamic State positions at dawn before advancing along a 20-mile front southwest of the city, seizing several villages and gaining around three miles in places.

Monday's gains bring the Peshmerga closer to the ISIS stronghold of Hawijah, where black-clad militants have paraded the bodies of what they said were 20 Shi'ite militiamen they had executed.

Speaking by telephone from the frontline near Tel Ward, Major-General Omar Saleh Hassan said: 'This morning we launched an attack on three axes. Our advances are continuing.'

He said his forces faced little resistance from Islamic State militants who are also fighting to hold the city of Tikrit around 110 km southwest of Kirkuk, as Iraqi forces close in.

Just north of Tikrit, home city of executed Sunni former president Saddam Hussein, Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite militia fighters began an offensive to regain control over the town of al-Alam.

Military commanders said some of the attacking force were ferried across from the west bank of the Tigris river, while others were approaching from other directions. 

'We have confirmed information from inside Al-Alam that a few Daesh (ISIS) fighters are still inside, mostly suiciders.

'This is why we attacked them from multiple directions in order not to give them time to catch their breath,' Al-Alam mayor Laith al-Jubouri said, referring to the fighters by their Arabic acronym. 

Jubouri, who has spent time with the attacking forces outside Al-Alam, said clashes were continuing in the south, west and north of the town.

In the Kirkuk offensive, elite Kurdish counter-terrorism units were taking part and one official said they had managed to detonate four vehicles rigged with explosives by firing on them from a distance.

The Kurds took full control of Kirkuk last August as the Iraqi army collapsed in the north and Islamic State militants overran almost a third of the country.

But the city has remained vulnerable, with the frontline no more than 20 kilometres away in some places and only an irrigation canal separating the two sides. 

In late January, Islamic State briefly overran Kurdish defences around Kirkuk.

Meanwhile, officials said the jihadist group executed 20 people who wanted to fight against them in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk.

The killings of the men, who wanted to join anti-ISIS paramilitary forces known as Popular Mobilisation units, took place in the town of Hawijah, a police intelligence officer and two local officials said.

The executions could not be independently confirmed, but a gruesome series of photos posted online and shared on social media are evidence that they took place.

The photos show the bodies of more than a dozen different men strung by their feet from light poles, what appears to be a communications or electricity tower, and under a massive sign featuring the ISIS flag and name.

Captions under the photos said the men were members of the Popular Mobilisation units and used a derogatory term that could either refer to the units' Shi'ite leadership, or indicate that the men were believed to be Shi'ites.

ISIS spearheaded a sweeping offensive last June that overran large parts of the country north and west of Baghdad, including in Kirkuk province.

Security forces backed by militia are battling to regain ground, with support from a US-led coalition and Iran.

The Popular Mobilisation units -- which are dominated by Shi'ite militia but include other volunteers, including Sunnis - have played a key role in the  fight, shoring up the government's flagging troops.

But Shi'ite militiamen have also been accused of carrying out atrocities targeting Sunni Arabs in areas retaken from ISIS.
