A section of Crystal Palace fans protested against the exorbitant costs of watching top flight football during The Eagles' game with Arsenal at Selhurst Park on Saturday.

Unfurling a banner, targeted at football's boardroom chiefs or 'pigs', supporters made their feelings clear about the new £5 billion Premier League broadcasting agreement signed by Sky and BT Sport earlier this month. 

Up 70 per cent on the current £3 billion deal, the two companies will share 168 live games between 2016 and 2019.

Despite the enormity of the fees involved, little of that money is expected to filter down to supporters; rather, the fulcrum will be directed towards players' salaries and transfer fees.

With mid-table Palace charging £45.00 per adult ticket for a 'Grade A' match - those against the likes of Arsenal, for example - it is little wonder that fans feel exploited. 

The cheapest season ticket at Selhurst Park this year costs £420.
