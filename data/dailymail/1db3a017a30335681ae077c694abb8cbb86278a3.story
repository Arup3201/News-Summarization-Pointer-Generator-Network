A former pilot who killed his estranged wife in a car crash after disabling her airbag and unbuckling her seatbelt was jailed for at least 24 years yesterday.

Iain Lawrence deliberately smashed into a tree in an attempt to commit  ‘the perfect murder’ hours after he and 47-year-old Sally had an ‘acrimonious’ row over their divorce.

Lawrence, 53, claimed the tragedy was an accident caused by an excruciating leg spasm that made him lose control of his Peugeot 406.

But a jury decided he killed his 
businesswoman wife because he could not accept that their marriage was 
over, and convicted him by an 11-1 majority.

Company director Lawrence, who was 
sacked as an airline pilot in 2007, was jailed for life with a minimum 
of 24 years.

Mr Justice Leggatt QC told him he had ‘executed with 
meticulous planning and efficiency’ a ‘ruthless and vile’ crime.

‘You thought that the crash would be 
seen as a tragic accident and that you would get away with murder,’ he 
said.

‘You would indeed have done so if it had not been for the thorough
 police investigation.’

The judge said the couple’s ten-year-old son will have to live with the knowledge that his mother was murdered by his father.

During a 12-day trial, Leicester Crown
 Court heard the couple had separated and Mrs Lawrence, who had two 
adult daughters from a previous marriage, had begun a new relationship.

But they were still living in the £300,000 marital home in Oadby, 
Leicester.

Nirmal Shant QC, prosecuting, accused 
Lawrence of trying ‘to plot the perfect  murder’.

Tragedy: Sally Lawrence had warned a friends that estranged husband Iain Lawrence: 'One day he will kill me'

She told the jury that
 the couple had an acrimonious discussion about the division of their 
assets the day before the crash in October last year.

Later Mrs Lawrence told one of her daughters in a text message that her husband wanted more than half of the house.

The jury were told the crash was 
staged while the couple’s son was away on a school trip.

Lawrence used 
‘trickery or force’ to get his wife – who had told friends she feared he
 would kill her and would never normally travel in a car with him – into
 the vehicle.

It careered off a bend on a quiet 
country road at 52mph.

The passenger side received the brunt of the 
collision and Mrs Lawrence, the managing director of a business which 
specialised in cleaning up chemical spills, was found to be dead at the 
scene.

The court heard that she was 
‘fanatical’ about being strapped in, but was not on this occasion.

Lawrence, who frequently did not wear his belt, was strapped in, 
adopted the ‘brace’ position, and escaped with minor injuries.

Accident investigators found that the car’s passenger airbag had been turned off for six journeys before Mrs Lawrence’s death.

Lawrence of Knighton, Leicester, 
denied murder, claiming his wife had willingly got into his car so that 
they could take some wood from their garden to a tip.

In an impact statement to the court, 
Mrs Lawrence’s sister, Catherine Kudhail, described the killing as ‘a 
monstrous act of utter cruelty’ and revealed that one of Mrs 
Lawrence’s children is now plagued by suicidal thoughts.

She added: ‘Sally was an inspirational, caring, kind woman with a huge heart.’
