A new computer system could allow people to vote in elections by text message.

Inventors say the process would keep voters anonymous and claim ballots can be counted accurately and checked for fraud.

Glasgow University scientists hope the Handivote system will lead to higher turn-outs among younger people who are used to texting their votes for reality TV shows.

In order to take part households would receive hand-delivered four-digit identification codes and PIN numbers in sealed envelopes.

The scheme was tested in a vote asking whether houses should be built in North Kelvin Meadow, in Glasgow.

Researchers received 483 responses to the question 'Build' or 'Don't Build' before the poll closed on Sunday.

In total, 451 - or 93 per cent - answered 'Don't Build' while 32 were in favour. Two abstained and nine responses were invalid.

Dr Paul Cockshott, one of the academics behind the system, said: 'This was the first time we had tried the system on such a scale, and the first public use of it.

'The system works by nobody but the recipient knowing what the voting card number is, and they send the code in the SMS to prove they are the recipient of the card."

Douglas Peacock, chairman of the North Kelvin Meadow Campaign, said: 'The technology is very interesting. When you think that someone has to use their mobile at their own cost to respond, that is pretty good.'

Dr Cockshott hopes the method will be used by local authorities and the Scottish Government in the future.

He added: 'We designed it with the view of being used in national votes as we think it will increase turnout especially with young people.

'I think it would be cheaper. All you need is to print out the voting cards.

You don't need to pay the staff at the polling booths.'

Dr Cockshott said in future an 'abstain' option would be added, and that letters would be sent to people on the electoral roll rather than being hand-delivered.

A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The Scottish Government is interested in any research and development of new technologies to make it easier for people to vote.

'However, we would need to make sure that any new mechanisms for voting are tried and tested and approved by the necessary organisations before they are used in any election.

'We do not currently have any plans to change methods of voting.'

An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: 'This is really something that the UK Government would be responsible for implementing.'
