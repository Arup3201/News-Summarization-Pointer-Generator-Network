Sophie Tweed-Simmons is back with her second clothing collection for Sophie x The Style Club in as many months - this time with jazzy dresses and jumpsuits for New Year's Eve.

The famously outspoken daughter of Kiss legend Gene Simmons, who is a passionate advocate for healthy body image, has created the line to compliment 'all women' in sizes 00 to 18; priced between $49 and $180.

But be careful what you call it. 'I hate the term 'plus-size,' Sophie, 22, tells MailOnline. 'Can we all just be women please? Why label it? Why ruin a good thing?'

The 15-piece collection features rompers, jumpsuits and dresses from mini to maxi-length, adorned with French lace, vegan leather, crushed velvet and sequin embellishments.

Along with her partner, The Style Club founder Hilary Novelle, Sophie worked with a set of upcoming trends and then found a way to make them look good on her body.

Her first collection with The Style Club, which launched in fall and sold out in a mere 72 hours, was built in much the same way.

'All the waistbands are elastic, which I prefer,' she told MailOnline in October. 'Essentially, the collection is based around my butt.'

Sophie, whose mother Shannon Tweed is a former Playboy Bunny, stands at 5'8" and is a U.S. size 8-10.

'I have never been a "skinny" girl, I've always been athletic and curvy and strong,' she remarks, adding that her weight has fluctuated over the years.

Ultimately with her new collection, Sophie states that her dream is to 'create affordable, empowering and flattering clothing for women of all sizes without labeling them.'

All of Sophie's New Year's Eve-inspired pieces are named after strong women she admires, from all walks of life.

There's the Billie Holiday sequin-speckled mini dress for example, and the seductive Marilyn Monroe off-the-shoulder number, both $49.

The Sofia floor-length gown is named after actress and family friend Sofia Vergara, the Ellen's LBJ jumpsuit is a tribute to TV host Ellen Degeneres and the Hepburn Bow Tie Jumper is a nod to Audrey Hupburn.

As she is: Sophie makes it a policy that her photos aren't re-touched. Pictured, the Demi Dress ($49), named after singer Demi Lovato

The collection also boasts a slinky, slit-thigh dress named after Girls creator Lena Dunham, as well as gowns inspired by former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, physicist Marie Curie and lifestyle mogul Oprah Winfrey.

Asked for her three favorite creations, Sophie named The Monroe Mini, the Janelle Jumper and the Lena Dress.

Sophie may talk the talk when it comes to defying the over-polished size-zero ideal that dominates the fashion world, but she walks the walk too. 

After completing her first photo shoot for Sophie x The Style Club, the star noticed that the images had later been retouched.

She promptly sent them back and asked them to be returned to their former natural glory. 'My legs looked too good,' she told Yahoo Style this week.

Budding musician: The collection will be available for purchase at 30per cent off through Sunday December 14, after which it will return to full retail price. Pictured, the Marie Mini ($49), named after physicist Marie Curie

As for her New Year's Eve plans and what she's planning to wear, Sophie reveals:

 'I actually haven't sorted that out yet. But wherever I am, I'll be wearing a dress from the collection and a pair of killer heels.'
