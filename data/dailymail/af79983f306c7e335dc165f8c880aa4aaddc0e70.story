Towering high above the model's head and detailing an intricate architectural structure, this remarkable piece of hair art makes the average fascinator pale into insignificance.

Thousands of strands of material have been woven to create the structure, which appears to be a church with five spires.

If you look closely, at the top of one of the spires sits an eagle and on others, tiny woven crosses.

High stakes: A model presents a stunning architectural creation on the catwalk

Towards to bottom of the 'hair art', you can even see a tiny door - complete with handle - embedded with jewels.

The structure is supported by a swirled screen, which runs around the back of the design and continues down the model's neck.

The art was just one of the incredible pieces on display at international beauty festival 'Banks of the Neva River' in St Petersburg today.

The annual festival attracts artists and beauticians from around the world, who gather to show-off their amazing pieces of hair art, make up work and other high fashion pieces.

This was one of the largest pieces on display today at the Banks of the Neva River festival

This shield-like creation features a crochet blue material and several hand-made flowers

Another model on the beauty festival's catwalk showed off a tall, spiders-web like piece with cascading strands of blue and white material that fell to below the shoulder.

The piece almost looks like a crown with its gold structure that sits on the top of the head and extends down the forehead.

Completing the look are two circular pads placed on the side of the head, just above the ear.

One of the largest creations on show went all the way from the model's lower back, up past her shoulders and above her head.

The white piece was kept in place with several thick strands of woven material that attached to various points on the model's upper body.

Another particularly wacky creation makes strands of the model's hair look like pieces of wicker

A more modest design featuring a white anchor in a bed of flowers that wrap around the model's head

Another model showed off a oval, blue and fuchsia creation - made from a crochet material.

Several hand-made flowers finish off the piece, which again towered high above the wearer's head.

One wacky look used the model's hair to weave a basket-like structure that fell over the face and round the back of her neck.

A more modest piece features an anchor in a bed of roses - a look that is bought to life by intricate make up.

Another model showed off some incredibly detailed make-up work that featured numerous gems place on and above the eyebrow, finished with swirls of black and silver paint.

As well as hair art, some amazing make-up artwork could also be seen such as this gem stone incrusted design
