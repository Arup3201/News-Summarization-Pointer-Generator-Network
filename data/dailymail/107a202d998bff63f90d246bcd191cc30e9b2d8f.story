A man fractured both his ankles and potentially his pelvis after he used an illegal rock swing in the Blue Mountains National Park, west of Sydney.

While tied to a rope attached to a tree, the 32-year-old leapt off Hanging Rock Point at Blackheath about 1.45pm on Sunday, and landed about eight metres onto a ledge.

New South Wales Police Inspector Peter Scheinflug said the extremely dangerous activity involved a person jumping from an escarpment and free falling until stopped by the rope, and then pendulum swinging.

The footage shows a thrill-seeker at Hanging Rock Point in the Blue Mountains stepping off a cliff, in the same location where an illegal rock swing was used by a man who was seriously injured on Sunday

The rope which is usually tied to a tree or a jutting rock point, stops the person from dropping metres into the valley

In this case, the man continued to swing after he landed and came to stop about 50 metres from the top of Hanging Rock, where people pulled him to the top.

An ambulance special casualty access team arrived and the injured man was carried a short distance before he was winched by a rescue helicopter to Westmead Hospital.

But videos posted on YouTube show the illegal rock swing at the Blue Mountains is a popular attraction for thrill-seekers.

NSW Police have warned illegal rock swinging is highly dangerous, not only risking the thrill-seeker's life, but the lives of those rescuing them if it goes awry

The adventurers are seen swinging back and forth between rock faces after the rope stops them from falling. The rope is usually tied to a nearby tree or around a rock point.

'It is shocking people take such risks and need to be warned about the obvious dangers,' Inspector Scheinflug told AAP.

'They are not only risking their own life but the lives of those whose job it is to rescue them.'

A ranger from NSW National Parks and Wildlife is investigating the alleged breach of safety laws.
