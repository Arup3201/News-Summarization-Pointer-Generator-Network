Chef Neil Iron laced truffles with ecstasy to 'liven up' a birthday party

A top chef who once served afternoon tea to the Queen was today spared jail after spiking chocolate truffles with ecstasy.

Neil Iron, 32, laced the desserts with the party drug to ‘liven up’ a birthday celebration at the Red Lion pub in Hoxton, north London.

Guest Charlie Webster had an ‘out-of-body experience’ after eating two ‘special’ chocolate truffles left over from the party, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Iron, a former head chef at The Royal Marsden hospital in Chelsea, once gave the Queen and Prince Edward afternoon refreshments when they opened a rehabilitation centre for cancer patients.

He also reached the semi-finals of the National Chef of the Year awards and was named the most promising hospitality and catering student of the year while studying at Waltham Forest College.

A jury of five men and seven women found Iron guilty of one count of administering poison or a noxious substance with intent.

But Iron was cleared of two further identical counts relating to two toddlers who were hospitalised after sharing a chocolate pudding allegedly spiked by Iron at the pub.

The court heard Iron had been cautioned last April for possession of cocaine.

Sentencing Iron to nine-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months, Judge Neil Sanders said: ‘This is a difficult case and as I indicated when you were convicted, I consider it crosses the custodial threshold, and I am still of that view.

‘Happily Charlie Webster didn’t suffer particularly greatly and he had been accustomed to taking ecstasy.

‘However the real danger was there was no telling from you as to what his reaction would be and in other circumstances - if he had to drive for example - the consequences could have been very much greater.

‘I’ still at a loss to what the motivation behind this was, whether it was a prank or anything more serious.

‘Anyone who supplies to someone else in this way a class A drug is bound to receive a prison sentence.

‘People speak extremely highly of you as a result of your career as a chef. That is something you enjoyed and is no longer going to be open to you and I am prepared to accept this is never going to be repeated.’

Judge Sanders also ordered that Iron complete 180 hours unpaid work and pay £2,500 court costs. He will also be subject to a three-month curfew from 9pm-6am.

Iron, who began working at the Red Lion last September, insisted he would never put drugs in food.

He claimed the chocolate truffles could have been tampered with by guests at the party, which started late on Saturday, October 8 last year.

‘It must have been a person from the party because that’s where the food was. I wasn’t in the room, I was in the kitchen,’ he said.

He claimed the chocolate mousse pots were made earlier in the week, stayed in the fridge and were nothing to with the party.

The truffles were made the day before the party, he said.

‘I took them out of the fridge and put them on a presentation plate which was left out with the guests all evening.

‘After that I returned to the kitchen as there were other areas of the pub open to the public.’

When the party ended at about 1.45am, guests brought in leftovers, including the truffles, to be stored in the kitchen overnight.

‘At that point, there were about six people milling around in the kitchen,’ Iron said.

‘They were putting stuff in boxes; other people were putting food in the fridge as well as me.

‘Before I left that night, I made sure the fridge door was closed and everything was fine.’

The next day, a couple took their two children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to the pub for a roast dinner.

The youngsters then shared a chocolate pot.

Iron was informed by police the following day that the children had been taken ill.

The chef denied telling Mr Webster that there were drugs in the ‘special’ chocolate truffles.

He insisted: ‘I have never suggested there were drugs in any of the products - I’m not going to say to someone, ‘would you like some drug laced food products’ when you are about to sit in my restaurant and consume a lunch.’

John King, defending Iron, said Mr Webster admitted in evidence that he has ‘not been an angel’ and ‘has engaged in taking ecstasy in the past on more than one occasion’.

‘The reality is Mr Iron will not be able to work in the catering trade again. He had a good record as a chef and in terms of punishment, the result of his actions has taken that away totally.’

Iron, of Charles Gardner Court, Haberdasher Street, Hoxton, denied three counts of administering poison or a noxious substance with intent, namely methylenedioxymethylamphetamine or MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy.
