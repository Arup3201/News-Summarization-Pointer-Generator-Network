They are usually used for urgent warnings, navigation, or tooting a well-meaning goodbye before a long journey.

But the horns of a giant cruise ship in the harbour of Hamburg Port were put to a more artistic use this weekend as they blasted out the well-known pop song Seven Nation Army.

The captain of the huge MSC Magnifica showed off his vessel's musical capabilities on Friday with a rendition of the song, made famous by two-piece rock band The White Stripes.

The simple yet catchy tune - often repeated at sporting events and among the staples of amateur musicians - boomed around the port on the first day of celebrations at the 825th anniversary of the German city's port, the second-largest in Europe.

It was gratefully received by the enthusiastic crowd, despite the slower-than-usual tempo. Videos of the impromptu performance have been viewed tens of thousands of times on Youtube.

As well as the ability to play simple tunes, the 95,000-ton Magnifica can also carry 3,500 passengers on its cruises, which take on a round trip from Southampton to Hamburg, via France and the Netherlands.

It has three swimming pools, five restaurants, a cinema, casino and on-board theatre. The 300m ship has a top speed of 22 knots (25mph).

The annual Port of Hamburg anniversary celebrations are billed as 'the world's greatest port festival'. This year's event began on Friday 9 May and finished this evening.

Highlights of the festival included a grand arrival parade as ships poured into the port, a 'tugboat ballet' and a firework display.

Seven Nation Army is by far the most popular song by The White Stripes, a two-piece rock band from Detroit.

Jack White, the band's frontman, has previously spoken of how he enjoys it when his song crops up in expected places. In a 2006 interview he said: 'Nothing is more beautiful than when people embrace a melody... as a songwriter it is something impossible to plan. Especially in modern times.'

MSC was not available for comment on the choice of song.
