A former child star, who was a child sex abuse victim, has spoken out about life, after her abuser was sentenced to jail.

Sarah Monahan, known as Jenny Kelly on popular Australian TV show, Hey Dad, played the daughter of disgraced actor Robert Hughes and was one of his child sex abuse victims.

The 36 year old was the whistleblower, who sparked an investigation against Mr Hughes, claiming she was sexually assaulted on the set of Hey Dad between 1987 and 1994, by on-screen father, Mr Hughes.

Sarah Monahan (pictured) former child star of popular Aussie TV show Hey Dad, says its still hard to move on despite her abuser, Robert Hughes', conviction. Since 2010, she has been a Braveheart ambassador, a sexual assault advocacy group

During an interview on A Current Affair in 2011, Monahan said that she intended to initiate legal actions against Hughes and television executives who, she claimed, were aware of Hughes' alleged actions and failed to take action.

Robert Hughes was arrested in London on 9 August 2012. He was extradited to Australia and in early April 2014 was found guilty of 10 child sex charges and was sentenced to a maximum of 10 years and nine months jail. 

Monahan has told News.com.au there are still people working in the Australian television industry who are perpetrators of child sexual abuse.

She's refused to go into any details or names but has given a scathing assessment of the entertainment industry's treatment of children.

'The industry doesn't care about kids. It's like child labour,' she said.

Ms Monahan has been an ambassador for Braveheart, a sexual assault advocacy group, since 2010.

Sarah Monahan is a Braveheart ambassador  and is helping to support their latest campaign, encouraging people to take a selfie answering the queestion #whoRUprotecting written on their hand and posting on social media

She has taken this week's, National child protection week, to speak out about child sex abuse and about her own story, which she says doesn't get any easier despite her abuser being found guilty and jailed.

'People kind of expected that once [Hughes] went to jail, that’s it and you move on,' she told News.com.au.

'You kind of do on some days and on other days you don’t. People expect me to say, ‘Good job, he’s in jail now’. But it really doesn’t work that way.'

While Ms Monahan has received a tidal wave of support since going public with her abuse, she's had to fend off accusations she did it for self promotion.

On her blog last month she posted her anger with suggestions that people who come out with abuse are just in it for the money and fame.

'I don’t think people grasp the concept that not everyone wants to be famous. Not everyone is looking for that 15 minutes,' she said.

'Some people just want to be heard. They want justice. They want to right a few wrongs.'

'Everytime I see a new person who is being investigated, for just a minute, I’m so happy that others are following in my footsteps, and are taking on the high profile untouchables. But that joy doesn’t last very long, because it only takes a few minutes for the doubters to come out.'

Ms Monahan told of how she spoke to several other former kid actors over in the US, where she now has been living for over a decade, who have also been through abuse.

'Some spoke up, some didn’t. They all know how terribly hard it is to live with, being judged. Every little thing you say will be over analyzed, picked apart, recorded, and then, if you’re lucky enough to make it to court, it can and will be used against you,' she said on her blog.

The 36 year old hopes that in time more abuse victims will come forward to tell their story and has put her support behind a new social media campaign, creating awareness.

Bravehearts are encouraging people to take a selfie answering the question #whoRUprotecting and write the answer on their hand and share it on social media.

A number of celebrities have shown their support including a list of NRL stars and officials, Queensland premier Campbell Newman, Commando and a number of high profiled TV hosts.
