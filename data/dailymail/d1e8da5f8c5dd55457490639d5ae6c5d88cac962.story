A wave of violence has been sweeping through Chicago in recent months, leaving dozens of victims in its wake, but that did not stop the local police department from sending 50 officers to help out at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

On Monday morning, Chicago cops in their unmistakable checkerboard-brimmed hats were seen positioned outside the Charlotte Convention Center. 

A Charlotte police department spokesperson confirmed that ‘roughly 50 officers from Chicago’ were on duty at the high-profile political event being held this week.

‘These are officers on their days off and were specially trained as mobile field force officers for the recent NATO summit in Chicago,’ Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Melissa Stratton told ABC News.

The move has drawn sharp criticism from community leaders in the Windy City, who questioned the logic behind sending officers out of town at a time when urban crime appears to be out of control. 

‘It's a state of emergency here in Chicago,’ Reverend Ira Acree told the Wall Street Journal last week.

At least 82 people have been wounded or killed on the streets of Chicago in the last ten days, with approximately ten of them gunned down on August 31 alone, according to a police report.

Drive-bys: Among the ten shot between late Thursday night and early Friday morning, several of them were the result of two drive by shootings

Into the morning: Later Friday morning, in broad daylight a 15-year-old girl was shot in the abdomen while caught in crossfire while walking home from school

The crime spree has left several teenagers and people in their 20s dead and wounded, including a 15-year-old girl who was struck in the abdomen in broad daylight while walking home from school with a friend.

Change of plans: Mayor Emanuel has decided to cut his trip to the Democratic National Convention short due to the crime wave in his city

The relentless gun violence has prompted Mayor Rahm Emanuel to request federal assistance. In response, a total of 50 U.S. marshals and agents from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents were dispatched to Chicago to assist the local police department.

In the next four months, the new arrivals will saturate the Grand Crossing and Ogden police districts on the South and West sides, which have been labelled conflict zones, the Chicago Tribune reported.

‘We've obviously had a very difficult August, so we have our work cut out for us,’ Mayor Emanuel said on Friday.

According to figures provided by the Chicago police, the city’s homicide rate is about 31 per cent higher than last year, leading many people, among them police union officials, to call into question the decision to send 50 officers to another state at this critical time.

The city's police force is comprised of 12,244 sworn officers. 

However, police say the officers were sent to Charlotte to reciprocate for the law enforcement forces sent by that city to assist during the recent NATO summit held in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department spokesperson said the officers serving in Charlotte will be paid through a special federal grant of $50million for convention security.

‘No funds from the City of Chicago are involved,’ Stratton said.

Meanwhile, on Monday, Mayor Emanuel, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff, has announced that he will be cutting his trip to the convention short in light of the violence back home, according to Politico.

Rather than stay in Charlotte through Friday morning as planned, the mayor will be leaving late Wednesday after delivering a speech at the convention the night before. The president is scheduled to address the delegates on Thursday.
