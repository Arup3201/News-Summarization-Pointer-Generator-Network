Jockey Johnny King was on his way to the start of the race during a meeting at Laytown, County Meath, when Arbitrageur suddenly threw its head back.

The jockey held on as the horse flew mid-air while groom Aidan Wall cowered in fear underneath. Despite the dangerous reaction, the rider escaped unhurt and led the horse to seventh in the race.

Since 1868 the village on the eastern coast of Ireland has hosted the only annual meet in the British Isles held on a beach under the so-called Rules of Racing.

It used to be held in conjunction with the Boyne Regatta - the rowing would take place at high tide while the horses would compete when the water had receded. 

Racegoers from all over the globe have attended the September event, including musicians, film stars and royalty. 

In the 1950s, the legendary owner the Aga Khan and his wife the Begum were in attendance.
