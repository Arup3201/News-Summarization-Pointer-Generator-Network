Ronda Rousey has signed a new multi-fight deal with the UFC.

The women's bantamweight champion has won all 11 mixed martial arts fights in her career, including five in the UFC.

Rousey is next in action against Bethe Correia at UFC 190 in Rio on August 1.

'I'm a UFC fighter,' Rousey said on ESPN's First Take. 'I just renegotiated. I have a lot of fights that I have in the UFC before I would be able to go do anything else.'

Rousey also admitted she would love to take on a boxing world champion in the future but said a fight against Muhammad Ali's daughter and former champion Laila was unlikely.

'I think that would be amazing. I'm not even saying specifically [against Ali]. 

'She's retired and has kids and has moved on with her life. I would think maybe someone closer to my weight that has a world title belt. 

'I would love to try it, but I have a lot going on. I have fights. I have two movies coming out. I have a book coming out. My schedule is a little full.' 

Rousey needed just 14 seconds to beat Cat Zingano and retain her UFC bantamweight title
