Catherine Hickman, 31, died after she was told to stay in her flat during the fire in South London in 2009

A victim of a tower block fire that claimed six lives was told by a 999 operator to stay in her flat, until the call ended with screams as the burning ceiling fell in.

Catherine Hickman, a 31-year-old designer, was on the phone to the fire brigade for an hour before she lost consciousness.

She died along with two women and three children in the blaze caused by a faulty television set in the 14-storey residential building in Camberwell, south London, in July 2009, an inquest heard yesterday.

Miss Hickman said her flat was ‘orange everywhere’ and smoke was coming through her floorboards.

She asked the operator, “What shall I do? Shall I get out?” She was told to move to a different room but replied that she had moved on to the balcony.

Counsel James Maxwell-Scott said: ‘She then said she had gone back into the flat because there was too much smoke. She asked if she should go downstairs or into the corridor. The operator said she ought not to open the door as she did not know what was on the other side.’

Jurors heard that the operator told her to get down on the floor and put something over her face to protect her from the smoke.

Miss Hickman said she couldn’t breathe very well and was getting very hot. She then screamed: ‘Oh my God. I can see flames at the door. It’s choking inside in here.’

The operator told her that fire crews were in the building. Shortly before Miss Hickman stopped speaking and could no longer be heard breathing, she was heard screaming that something had fallen on her from the ceiling.

Helen Udoaka, 34, and her 20-day-old daughter Michelle, were also killed in the blaze, along with Dayana Francisquini, 26, and her children, Thais, six, and Filipe, three.

The electrical explosion ripped through a ninth floor flat and the flames spread to other flats in the block

They had all taken refuge in the 
11th-floor flat next door to Miss Hickman. In a phone call to the fire 
brigade, Miss Udoaka told of her horror as her flat, where she was 
nursing her newborn baby, was filled with smoke.

‘She said she and her baby were trapped and there was “so much smoke”,’ Mr Maxwell-Scott said.

‘The operator advised her to use a 
towel or blanket to stop the smoke coming in. She replied, “Everywhere 
is choked with smoke”.’

The 14-storey 
building consisted of 98 maisonette flats. The fire reached the 11th floor 
where the victims lived

Miss Hickman lived in flat 79. The other victims perished in flat 81 where they had all taken refuge together

Dayana Francisquini with son Filipe Francisquini, aged 3, and daughter Thais Francisquini aged four taken on her fourth birthday at home. All died in the tower block fire

Baby Michelle Udoaka, the 3 week old daughter of Helen Udoaka, died in the Camberwell tower block inferno along with her mother

The inquest was formally opened on July 15, 2009- 12 days after the blaze at Lakanal House (pictured) happened- but resumed today

The inquest was told that Miss 
Francisquini’s panicked husband, Rafael Cervi, also called 999 to tell 
the operator that his family was trapped and he was a few minutes away 
from the building.

The fire started on the ninth floor of Lakanal House 
after a faulty TV caught alight. It quickly spread through the building,
which consisted of 98 maisonette flats, up to the 11th floor where the 
victims lived.

Firefighters arrived at the building 
within minutes of it being reported, but the fire was so ferocious it 
was hours before they reached the bodies of the victims.

No legal action was taken over the 
deaths after an extensive investigation by Metropolitan Police and 
Southwark Council, which owns the building. Prosecutors decided in May 
last year not to press manslaughter charges as there was no realistic 
prospect of conviction.

The inquest, which is being held at Lambeth Town Hall, is expected to last until the end of March.
