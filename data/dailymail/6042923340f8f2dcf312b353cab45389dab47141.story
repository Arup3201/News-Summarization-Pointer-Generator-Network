'Too busy': Sir Jeremy Heywood is under fire for failing to conduct an inquiry into 'Plebgate'

Top mandarin Sir Jeremy Heywood, under fire for being ‘too busy’ to conduct a proper inquiry into the ‘Plebgate’ scandal, has had a lavish  walk-in wine cellar built at  his £2million home.

With the nation facing the prospect of a triple-dip recession and years of austerity, Sir Jeremy, the £190,000-a-year Cabinet Secretary and one of David Cameron’s most trusted advisers, is believed to have spent about £200,000 to build several basement rooms, including the wine cellar.

Britain’s most senior civil servant astonished MPs when he admitted last week that he failed to check if former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell had used the word ‘pleb’ when he swore at  a policeman at the gates of Downing Street last year.

Sir Jeremy, 51, said he suspected a ‘gigantic conspiracy’ but admitted that he did not  look into the most contentious allegation made about Mr Mitchell, who was forced to  quit over the row, because he  was too busy.

Married father-of-three Sir Jeremy is said to have accepted a five-figure bonus  last year despite Cabinet Ministers urging restraint.

The wine cellar has been built by specialist firm Oxford and London Building Consultancy.  Its website boasts: ‘We don’t  just install them – we design them from scratch to suit the types of wine you buy.

‘Above all else an OLBC Bespoke Wine Cellar has to reflect your taste in wine and be a place where you can share your love of wine with friends.’

As well as the wine cellar,  plans show Oxford-educated Sir Jeremy’s six-bedroom home in South London now has a study,  kitchen, living room, sitting room, bathroom and storeroom  in the new basement.

Astonished: MPs were surprised to hear Sir Jeremy failed to check if former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell (pictured) had used the word 'pleb' when he swore at a policeman

It is believed they will be used by an elderly relative.

A spokesman for Sir Jeremy declined to comment last night.
