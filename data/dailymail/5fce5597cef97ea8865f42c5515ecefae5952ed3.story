Parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children, raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu, measles and mumps, a new study suggests.

Researchers from the University of Colorado surveyed 534 physicians across the country with 93 per cent reporting that they had received requests for jabs to be rescheduled.

Some parents wanted to space shots out so their children weren't jabbed so many times in one sitting while others worried about possible vaccine-related neurological complications.

Children in the U.S. receive around 29 vaccines for about 14 illnesses between birth and six years, based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Growing trend: Parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children, raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu, measles and mumps, a new study suggests 

Three-quarters of the doctors surveyed said they agreed to vaccine delays at least some of the time, even though they knew it was potentially harmful.

In some cases, practitioners feared they would lose patients from their practice if they pushed the recommended vaccine schedule too hard.

Only three per cent said they had refused such requests.

Overall, 25 per cent of doctors said the demand for injection delays were up from the previous year.

Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children have faced scrutiny after a measles outbreak in California blighted more than 100 adults and children since December.

Most cases are tied to an outbreak at Disneyland in California, which likely began with a traveler who brought it in. 

However, the exact source of the Disneyland-linked cases is not known. 

Doctors are concerned about unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children becoming ill and spreading disease to others. 

The potential repercussions are worrisome and are happening 'right now with the measles outbreak,' said Dr. Allison Kempe, a University of Colorado researcher and a member of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee. 

The survey, conducted in 2012, didn't ask doctors which particular vaccines parents asked to delay.

The recommended CDC vaccine schedules are based on research around what time they will be most effective at preventing disease.

Delaying shots targeted for certain ages means they may be less effective later on.

It also makes it more likely that children will never get vaccinated, because parents get too busy or forget to schedule another doctor's visit, said Dr. Robert Frenck, an infectious diseases specialist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. 

He was not involved in the new study, published in Monday's Pediatrics.

'People just don't understand that these diseases are all there, they're not gone. They're just being kept at bay right now. If people stop vaccinating, they come right back,' Frenck said.

Doctors involved in the University of Colorado investigation were all certified members of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians - the two leading groups of doctors who treat young children.
