Can you remember what you were doing this time yesterday? Perhaps not, but scientists have proved what Claude Monet was doing at 4.53pm on February 5, 1883.

The great French Impressionist was standing on a rocky beach in Normandy, looking at the sunset.

A five-strong team of astronomers looked at the painting The Cliff, Éretat, Sunset, and used the position of the dark red setting sun to work out exactly when Monet took his inspiration.

An exact science: A team of astronomers has decided Monet took the inspiration for this painting at 4.53pm on February 5, 1883. They studied the position of the setting sun compared to the needle of rock

The work was one of three painted by Monet during a three-week stay in 1883, but the only one containing the disc of the sun.

Physics professor Donald Olson, from Texas State University, said this was the crucial detail which allowed his five-strong team to date the work.

He said: 'The canvas shows the orange disk of the Sun sinking toward the horizon near a spectacular line of cliffs.

'We
 like to use astronomy to show students how science can solve real-world
 puzzles.

'We asked, "Could we use the dramatic rocks in 
the landscape and the position of the setting sun to determine where and
 when, specifically, Monet created this beautiful masterpiece?"'

To start with, the researchers paced up and down the French beach to decide where Monet had stood when he took in the view.

A fine art: The unusual rock formations meant the scientists could work out where Monet had stood. In this photo, they worked out the exact location of the painting known as Porte D'Amont

They had been told where the artist was said to have stood, but they quickly realised art historians had got it wrong.

Instead, using postcard-sized copies of his paintings for reference, they figured out Monet had been standing 425 yards away on a rocky beach under an overhanging cliff.

Then they had to work out the date and time. They knew Monet had visited the area in winter 1883, so they used planetarium software to compare the modern sky to that of the 19th Century.

With the crescent moon for reference, they discovered the sun must have set along the path depicted in the painting on February 5.

Just to be sure, they checked two days on either side by combing through the artist's letters.

On February 3 he was working on a different beach; on February 4 he was entertaining his brother; on February 6 the tides did not match the painting and on February 7 it was raining.

Natural beauty: Monet was inspired by the cliffs and later returned to paint them in this work from 1886

Seen by many as the greatest Impressionist, Monet showed his world in rough, wild brush strokes

Lastly, the researchers worked out what time the work was painted.

They compared sunset charts to the needle-like Aiguille rock, calculating exactly when the sun would have passed the formation.

Mr Olson added: 'We were going out there at low 
water - it's just safer that way.

'Ava, [one of the researchers],
 is accustomed to difficult hiking terrain, and she said that the 
beaches near Étretat had the most difficult footing she'd ever been on 
in her life. It's really tough.

'And as you get farther out, 
it gets worse, because it’s slippery, with the rocks covered with 
seaweed that’s still wet from the previous high tide.

'Monet went out there with all 
of his painting equipment.

Walking in Monet's footsteps: The team stand on the same spot where he took his inspiration

'We
 were able to determine the month, day, hour and precise 
minute, accurate to plus or minus one minute, when Monet was inspired by
 that beautiful scene.

'Monet observed this sunset on February 5, 1883 at 4.53pm local mean time.'

The extraordinary discovery was made possible because the sun follows a slightly different path on each day of the year, because of the changing seasons.

In winter it follows a short, shallow arc across the sky but in summer it rises further to the east, lifts higher in the sky and sets further to the west.

The findings have been published in the latest issue of Sky & Telescope magazine by Mr Olson, a veteran of 'forensic astronomy' who has studied works by Edvard Munch, J.M.W. Turner and Vincent van Gogh.
