An American has been jailed for two-and-a-half years in Thailand after posting excerpts from a banned book about the country's monarch online - while living in the U.S.

Joe Gordon, 55, who was born in the Southeast Asian kingdom but has lived in the U.S. for 30 years, translated pages from The King Never Smiles - a critical biography of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej - while living in Colorado five years ago.

But when he visited the country of his birth in May to seek medical treatment for arthritis and high blood pressure, he was arrested and charged under Thailand's strict lese majeste laws.

After being repeatedly denied bail, he pleaded guilty to defaming the monarch in October in the hope of obtaining a lenient sentence.

Speaking after today's verdict in Bangkok, Mr Gordon said: 'I am an American citizen, and what happened was in America.

'This is just the system in Thailand. In Thailand, they put people in prison even if they don't have proof.'

Washington has condemned Mr Gordon's sentence as severe 'because he has been sentenced for his right to freedom of expression'.

And New York-based Human Rights Watch has urged authorities to amend the laws, saying the penalties being meted out were 'shocking'.

Mr Gordon, a former car salesman, was 
charged with translating excerpts from the unauthorised biography of the
king published by Yale University Press, into the Thai language and 
publishing them in a blog. He also provided links to the translation to 
other two web forums, prosecutors said.

Thailand's lese majeste laws are the harshest in the world. They mandate that people found guilty of defaming the monarchy - including the king, the queen and the heir to the throne - face up to 15 years behind bars. Last month, 61-year-old Amphon Tangnoppakul was sentenced to 20 years in jail for sending four text messages deemed offensive to the crown.

Opponents of the laws say that while the royal family should be protected from defamation, lese majeste laws have often been abused to punish political rivals in Thailand. That is especially true since the nation suffered a 2006 military coup.

Thailand has come under increasing pressure to reform legislation that critics say is an affront to freedom of expression, and Mr Gordon's case has raised questions about the applicability of Thai law to acts committed by foreigners outside Thailand.

Many had hoped that Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's administration, which has some prominent supporters who have been accused of lese majeste, would reform the laws. The issue remains highly sensitive, however, and Yingluck's government has been just as aggressive in pursuing cases as its predecessors.

The rise of the Internet in recent years has given Thai authorities many more targets to prosecute. Last month, Information Minister Anudith Nakornthap said Facebook users who 'share' or 'like' content that insults the Thai monarchy are committing a crime. Anudith said Thai authorities asked Facebook to remove 86,000 pages between August and November because of alleged lese majeste content.

King Bhumibol, who celebrated his 84th birthday on Monday, is the world's longest-reigning monarch and is profoundly revered in Thailand.

Asked if he would stay in Thailand after serving his time, Gordon said: 'I would like to stay and see some positive Thailand. I want to see the real, amazing Thailand, not the messy Thailand.'
