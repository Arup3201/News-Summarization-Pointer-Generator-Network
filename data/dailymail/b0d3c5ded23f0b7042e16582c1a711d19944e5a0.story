Cheryl Cole has revealed she is 'happy and excited' to make her return to The X Factor.

The 30-year-old singer's return was announced on Monday night by music mogul Simon Cowell, who tweeted: 'It's official. Cheryl is back. Be careful what you wish for!'

And in an official comment, Cheryl said: ''I’m very happy and 
excited to be returning to The X Factor. I’m inspired and ready to find 
new talent and potential pop stars. It’s going to be a fun series.'

Cheryl's comment came after she posted a new shot of herself and Simon on her Instagram page, showing her with her hands around the mogul's neck.

The
 news comes as it was reported that Cheryl has signed a £1.5million deal
 to return to the show, which she was previously on the judging panel 
for from 2008 to 2010.

And Cheryl's bumper contract will reportedly be worth £500,000 more than any other judge on the programme except for Simon.

Are you looking forward to seeing Cheryl Cole back on The X Factor?

The
 music mogul reportedly earns more than £8million a year from both The X
 Factor and Britain's Got Talent, on which he is also a judge, combined.

According to The Sun newspaper, a friend
 of the former Girls Aloud singer said: 'This is nothing to do with the 
money. She loves the show and has unfinished business.' 

Cheryl
 and Simon fell out when he fired her from the panel of the US version of the show three years ago, but they are 
reportedly set to appear at a press conference on Tuesday to confirm her
 re-appointment to The X Factor panel.

A friend of Cheryl added to the newspaper: 'Simon has been begging her to go back for years. But only now is the time right.

'She feels like a different person to the last time she was on the show — she can finally be happy.'

Simon - who was a judge on the show from 2004 to 2010 - has also confirmed he will reprise his role on the panel this year.

He
 said in a press release: 'I am so happy that Cheryl has agreed to join 
The X Factor again. The last time we worked together in the UK was 
incredible and produced some really successful artists. Obviously the 
plan is to do the same again... so it's back to work!'

Simon is said to have 
spent the last few months trying to convince the singer to return to the
 programme and finally got his way when she reportedly negotiated a deal
 in private last week.

It 
has so far not been confirmed as to who will take up the remaining two 
judges seats but the new series is set to return later this year.

Despite
 previously announcing he was not returning to the judging panel in 
2014, Louis Walsh is a huge favourite with bookmakers Paddy Power at 
1/50 to also reprise his role as a panellist this year.
