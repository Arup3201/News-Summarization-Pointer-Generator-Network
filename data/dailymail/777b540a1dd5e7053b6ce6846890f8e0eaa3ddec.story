Marmalade, royalty, bungalow and booze – they might seem quintessentially English words.

But an exhibition opening today reveals that some of our most common words are in fact not ours at all.

The English Effect, staged at the British Council in London, examines how we absorb words from overseas and although English originally developed from Germanic dialects, there are plenty of individual foreign words which have since been added to our vocabulary.

Foreign invasion: The word 'zombie' was created by merging the West African words for 'fetish' and 'god'

The word booze, for example, has its 
origins in the medieval Dutch word busen, which means ‘to drink to 
excess’ – and was first used in English by the thieves and beggars of 
the 1500s.

And despite an urban myth that the 
word bungalow was coined when a builder was told to ‘bung a low roof’ on
a house after running out of bricks, it actually originated in the 
Bengal region of India.

There it was a name for one-storey 
homes built for early European immigrants, meaning ‘belonging to 
Bengal’.

Among other absorbed words are: royal, which came from France 
during the middle ages; marmalade, taken in the 1400s from the 
Portuguese word marmelo meaning ‘quince’; and shampoo, which derived 
from the Hindi word for ‘press or knead’ and came to mean ‘massage’ in 
18th-century English.

Meanwhile zombie and vampire – 
ever-popular characters in English-speaking films – have their roots in 
West Africa and Hungary respectively.

Even the word for a favourite English drink, cider, originated from the Middle East.

Bloody Mary: We may have named the drink after an English queen, but both tomato and booze are foreign words, the former being an old Aztec word for grow and the latter old Dutch slang for excessive drinking

1. Dollar (German)

2. Booze (Dutch)

3. Bungalow (Hindi or Bengali)

4. Tomato (Aztec Nahuatl - Mexico)

5. Zombie (West African via the Caribbean)

6. Vampire (Hungarian)

7. Parka (Russian)

8. Shampoo (Hindi)

9. Magazine (Arabic)

10. Avatar (Sanskrit).

John Worne, director of strategy at the British Council, said that examining the roots of these words can offer an insight into our history.

‘Many of our most popular and 
evocative English words – words we couldn’t live without – came from 
other countries and cultures,’ he said.

‘When we look at their roots, we get a fascinating insight into how the language has been influenced throughout its history.

‘English is not just “our” language – 
it truly belongs to the whole world, and brings real benefits to anyone 
who can speak it.

'Even a few words can bring work, a job or new opportunities.’

Split into three zones the first part of the exhibition examines the value of learning English and the personal benefit it brings to people from around the world.

A ‘talking wall’ allows individuals, among them footballers Dider Drogba and Petr Cech, to discuss how the language helps them express themselves and form friendships with their teammates.

The second zone addresses the economic value of the language which remains an essential part of entry into many industries.

The English teaching industry alone is worth around £2billion to the UK economy.

The free exhibition runs until June 29.
