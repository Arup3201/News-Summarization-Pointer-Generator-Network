The grandson of former President Jimmy Carter is running to be the next governor of Georgia.

Jason Carter is the son of the former president's son Jack, and the 38-year-old has been working at the local level as one of the Democratic state senators since 2010.

'I wouldn’t be getting in this race if I didn’t think I was going to win. I’m still mad that I finished second in my law school class. I’m not in this to finish second,' he told WBSTV.

Hat in the ring: Jason Carter, 38, has announced that he is running as a Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia and many expect his family name to help him raise money for his campaign

He is launching his political campaign on the call for education reform in the state.

'We want a Georgia that’s at its best, 
and Georgia at its best invests in education, it doesn’t cut billions 
out of the classrooms, it has an economy that works for the middle class
and it always has an honest government,' he told the Atlanta Journal 
Constitution.

Carter is joining an already crowded field for the 2014 election as the state's current governor, Republican Nathan Deal, has announced that he will be seeking re-election.

Deal also faces two challengers from within his own party.

Now that Carter is in the race, it is clear that the Republican primary winner will face a well-financed Democrat with many supporters who have long been fans of his family.

'I think there will be a lot of nostalgia for those of us who covered politics in Georgia for a long time,' political analyst Bill Crane told WSBTV.

'It’s a brand in Georgia with staying power and cache, but it’s also a brand that connotes, in a lot of people’s minds, liberalism and a failed presidency.'

Jimmy Carter was the last Democratic President to only serve one term, and a recent book revealed that while he has been extremely active in international politics and even won a Nobel Peace Prize since leaving office, he is the least popular member of the group of ex-presidents.
