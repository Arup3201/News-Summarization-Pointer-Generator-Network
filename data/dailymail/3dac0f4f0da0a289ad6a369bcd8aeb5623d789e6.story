Lost: Eric Sinacori, 20, was a junior at UMass Amherst on a scholarship, but at the same time was struggling with abuse problems

It was the father and step-mother of a UMass Amherst junior that first discovered his lifeless body next to a needle and syringe in the bathroom.

While the parents say they had no idea 20-year-old Eric Sinacori even had a heroin problem, university police had found a hypodermic needle after catching him dealing club drugs months before.

But instead of arresting him or informing the family, UMass police turned him into an informant, then cut him loose  to continue down his fatal path.

'You’re always looking to move up the ladder and get an individual that is more of a threat to our community,' UMass Police Chief John Horvath told the Boston Globe. 

UMass announced Tuesday it is now suspending its confidential informant program and thoroughly reviewing it.

A memorial scholarship was set up in Sinacori's memory, and family members and friends remember Sinacori, who played high school hockey in his home state of New Jersey and attended UMass thanks to a significant scholarship, as a passionate young man.

The university first became interested in his drug habits after another confidential informant told police he was dealing Molly, the powdered form of MDMA, which is the active ingredient in ecstasy.

A university officer, with the help of a Drug Enforcement Agency agent, arranged two buys of Molly and LSD off Sinacori late in 2012.

After the officer revealed his identity, Sinacori worried that his world was about to come crumbling down. But campus police made him an 'offer I couldn't refuse,' as he put it in a text message to a friend, in exchange for becoming an informant.

Sinacori took $80 from the undercover officer and bought LSD off of another suspected drug dealer in the dorm. Both the dealer and another student in the room were arrested on drug charges and suspended.

But Sinacori walked free. In return for complying, he faced no criminal charges and no academic sanctions. He kept his merit-based scholarship and his parents were kept in the dark.

Dec 8, 2012 - Eric: Anyone with anything going for them would do the same..and for te record all [person] had was a couple strips on him.

Friend: [Expletive] man, I can't say I fully agree but I'm glad you told me the truth. So does that mean you're not in trouble at all? No fines, suspension from school, or anything like that

Eric: Nah dude nothing. Which is the only reason I did it., I have to live with this [expletive] which really really sucks but it is what it is. Iit was either give my friend up who was already under heavy investigation or go to jail for 5 years and be done for life..such a [expletive] up lose lose situation that ill never be able to forget ya know

Friend: Yeah that's true. I take it you're done selling anything

Eric: I'm def takin a break and if I do start again ill be super careful and def not be as big as I was. Burner phone and [expletive] haha

Police even returned $700 in cash that had been seized from Sinacori's dorm. The only thing they kept was a hypodermic needle. 

Oct 3 - Eric: [Expletive] my veins are crying...is the traffic gonna be bad?

Alleged dealer: I know you’re hurting but you will very soon be in the loving comforting arms of Miss H 

Oct 27 - Eric: You killed my son you [expletive] bastard. I hope you live a life of [expletive] hell and are as haunted as you've made me for the rest of your miserable [expletive] life [name]. You will rot in hell!

Horvath told the Boston Globe that the needle did not definitely point to heroin use, especially when none of the drug was found in the dorm and the student denied having a problem. Sinacori's mother Francesca believed officers missed an opportunity to intervene.

'If you find a needle on my kid, you have to assume it’s heroin. And if it’s heroin, you have to say something,' she said. 'Because that’s the drug that kills everybody.'

Drug and alcohol policy at UMass normally stipulates that a student's parents be called after the first violation. An exception is made for the confidential informant program. 

At the time, the student was already struggling with drug abuse. Text messages obtained by the Boston Globe showed Sinacori days before the bust trying to buy heroin to ease the painful symptoms of withdrawal.

But the family also missed the signs, having seen Sinacori get arrested for cocaine when he was still a teenager, but believing it was an isolated incident.

He seemed to kick drugs the summer after the bust, but relapsed later in the year. On the night of his death, he was texting with someone driving to deliver heroin who had gotten stuck on traffic on the way. 

'My veins are crying,' read one message. 

Baggies of heroin labeled Tropicana were dropped off. Sinacori went inside to shoot up. He didn't respond to follow up texts asking about the drug's effects, and hours later he was dead. 

Eric's mother later texted the alleged dealer angrily from Logan's phone, ending by saying, 'You will rot in hell!'

As UMass evaluates its informant program, it struggles to understand how its student body gets hard drugs onto the university.

Review: UMass Amherst Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy says the university has suspended the confidential informant program and will review it

Though officers said they couldn't remember the last heroin arrest, Horvath admits 'there may be an underlying heroin problem that we’re unaware of.'

A former student now in detox, Maddie Schnier, 22, said it was 'ridiculous' how easy it was to obtain. '“If someone needed heroin I would be like, "come for a drive with me. I’ll take you."'
