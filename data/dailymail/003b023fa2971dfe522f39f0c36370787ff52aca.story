'Traumatised': Chester the kitten (pictured shortly after being rescued) was dumped into a bucket of oil by a group of teenagers

A gang of teenagers left a kitten 'traumatised' after they tried to drown it in oil.

The gang is also suspected of planning on setting the six-week-old kitten on fire before a passer-by intervened and saved the cat's life.

The kitten, which has been named Chester, is now being cared for at Wear Valley and Darlington Cats Protection.

The man, who did not want to be named, was driving through Chester-le-Street, in County Durham, when he saw the teenagers 'messing about'.

He said: 'I was working in Chester-le-Street and was lost. I pulled up to make a phone call and saw the youths messing about.

'I got out and took the kitten off them while they shouted abuse at me. The kitten was traumatised - these people are just imbeciles and cruel.

'I suppose I saved itâ€™s life. It was lucky I was in a van and higher up so I saw it, because if i had been in a car then I would not have seen it.'

The youths are believed to have been about 14-years-old.

Marion Maychell, a volunteer co-ordinator at the cat rescue charity, said: 'We are hoping that the kitten is going to be ok.

'I did not think it would make it through the first night. We will look after the kitten until we can home it.

'It is scary that people could do this. They may have been covering it in oil to set it alight. I think the man that rescured the kitten is a hero.

'Thankfully incidents like this are rare, but we are seeing an increase in them.'

The kitten is thought to be about six weeks old.

Vet Jeremy Demeyre, of the Wilson Veterinary Group, in Bishop Auckland, said: 'We washed the kitten and clipped its fur. I think he swallowed some oil.

'He may be alright, but problems may arise in the next few days. This is the first case I have had where someone has tried to drown a kitten in oil.'

Anyone who can help home the kitten is asked to call 0845 313 4749.
