She once loved him and treated him to toys and trips to the seaside, yet in a case that has shocked the nation, four-year-old Daniel Pelka’s mother ended up killing him, after months of appalling abuse.

Daniel’s aunt, Sylwia Luczak, is still trying to comprehend how her older sister Magdelena, with lover Mariusz Krezolek, could have starved, tortured and beaten Daniel to death.

And as the evil pair begin a life sentence in jail, she is still blaming herself for not realising the danger Daniel was in.

The mother who tortured him: 27-year-old Magdelena Luczak locked her son Daniel Pelka, 4 in a room and systematically starved him. Her sister Sylwia said she was once a good mother

'Callous and wretched': The judge who gave Daniel's mother Magdalena Luczak, 27, and his stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34 (left) life sentences said the scale of his suffering was horrific

‘I blame myself – I wish I had asked more questions and discovered the truth,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘Then Daniel might still be alive today.’

Sylwia, who was Daniel’s only other adult blood relative in the UK, said her sister had been a normal mother before she met Krezolek.

‘When Magda was pregnant with Daniel, she behaved like any other expectant mother,’ Sylwia said. ‘I saw them often when Daniel was little and I am sure she loved him. 

‘She bought him toys and they went on trips with the whole family. Once they went to the seaside in Wales and another time to a theme park near Coventry.

'We were in and out of each other’s houses all the time. She had problems with alcohol but that didn’t seem to stop her being a normal mother.’ 

Sylwia, 24, continued: ‘Daniel was a lovely little boy. He seemed healthy and happy. It all stopped when she met Mariusz and gave birth to his child.

'The other siblings were treated OK but Daniel was a bit different. Perhaps that is why Mariusz took against him.’

Guilt: Sylwia said the family was happy before her sister met Mariusz Krezolek. She said she blames herself for not realising the danger Daniel was in

Daniel weighed just 1st 9lbs when he died in March last year.

During his final months, his mother 
and her lover starved him, forced him to perform punishment exercises, 
locked him in a tiny room, poisoned him with salt and held him under 
cold water until he lost consciousness.

As
 the authorities in Coventry investigate whether more could have been 
done to save Daniel, it has emerged that teachers at his school, 
Coventry’s Little Heath Primary, were offered counselling. 

At
 school, the starving boy scavenged in bins, scoffed birthday cake and 
filled his pockets with fruit from his class’ communal bowl but teachers
 believed his mother’s lie that he had an eating disorder.

Now Sylwia wants to know why social workers, police and teachers missed so many opportunities to save him.

Three
 weeks before he died, the starving boy, wearing just his underpants, 
stood in front of consultant paediatrician Dr Supratik Chakraborty.

He might have saved him had he acted, but instead he prescribed worming tablets and referred him for another appointment.

Dr Chakraborty was yesterday unavailable for comment. Neighbours in Oadby, Leicestershire, said he and his family had gone to India for a short break.

Luczak, 27, and Krezolek, 34, were jailed for at least 30 years after being found guilty of Daniel’s murder last week after a nine-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Sylwia, who lives near her sister’s former family home in Coventry, helped secure the convictions by giving evidence for the prosecution.

Despite that, she has been ostracised by some of the city’s 30,000-strong Polish community and her house has been attacked, forcing the family to move to a secret address.

In an emotional interview, Sylwia said she had cut herself off from her sister and would not visit her in prison.

She blames the couple entirely for Daniel’s death and is amazed that school staff, doctors and child protection experts accepted their assurances that Daniel was not being mistreated. 

She also claims social workers accused her of having known he was being starved and beaten – something she fervently denies.

‘Please don’t misunderstand me,’ she said. ‘I hold Mariusz directly responsible for killing Daniel. And I hold my sister responsible for failing in her maternal duty to protect her child.

'I also blame myself. I wish I had asked more questions and discovered the truth. Then Daniel might still be alive today.

Life imprisonment: Luczak, left, and Krezolek, right, systematically starved Daniel, poisoned him with salt and subjected him to water torture

Murdered schoolboy: Daniel Pelka died severely malnourished after being starved in the months leading up to his death by his mother and stepfather, who the judge said showed 'no remorse'

‘They lied to me just like they lied 
to the council and the police. But all those professional people who 
called at their home knew there was a small child in there. They knew 
Mariusz was a violent drunk who beat up Magda. I can’t understand why 
Daniel was allowed to remain in the house.’

Sylwia,
 who is doing a college course in maths and English and hopes to find a 
job as a  classroom teaching assistant, has two young children who 
attend local schools.

‘At 
my daughter’s school it has to be written down in a special book if a 
pupil even grazes their knee. But Daniel was tortured and no one in 
authority seems to have done anything about it or even noticed.’

Sylwia
 said she had tried to persuade her sister to leave Krezolek. ‘I often 
told Magda that she and Daniel should come and live with me because I 
knew Mariusz was violent towards her. But she was frightened at what he 
might do if she moved out.’

Between August and December 2010, the police twice notified Children’s Services that officers had been to the house following reports of domestic abuse.

Under lock and key: Daniel was left in a box room in the family's Coventry home with nothing more than a dirty mattress to sleep on

Imprisoned: The door on Daniel's room had been tampered with so his siblings could not let him out

In January 2011, Krezolek broke Daniel’s arm in a violent assault but claimed the boy had fallen off a sofa. Social workers returned to the house in Coventry but decided to take no further action.

There followed a well-documented series of visits by education welfare officials, concerned about his absence from school, and health workers specially trained in combating domestic violence.

Daniel, who was born in Coventry, in July 2007, died in March last year, two days after Krezolek delivered a fatal blow to his head in what was described in court as the climax of an escalating and incomprehensible campaign of cruelty.

No funeral has taken place yet because of the police investigation.

Sylwia said: ‘My family want the body to be sent back to Poland. But I would like him to be buried here. He was born in Britain and this is where he should have grown up.’

Daniel’s two siblings, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, are in the care of fostering and adoption agencies.

Child protection expert Dr Supratik Chakraborty was criticised during the trial for failing to spot Daniel’s malnutrition three weeks before he died.

The little boy had initially been referred to the consultant paediatrician by a school nurse on October 10, after Luczak told her that Daniel had an ‘excessive appetite’ and would punch her when not allowed food.

After a number of missed appointments, the expert finally got to examine Daniel on February 10, 2012.

Dr Chakraborty, who looked at the boy in his underpants, confirmed that his body mass index had almost fallen off the measurable scale but decided to prescribe worming tablets and refer him for further investigation.

At his post-mortem three weeks later, Daniel weighed only 1st 9lb and he was covered in 23 separate injuries.

Professor Peter Milla, an expert in child malnutrition, told the court that his condition represented a campaign of sustained starvation that would have lasted for months.

He said: ‘Malnutrition would have been present when he saw Dr Chakraborty – either he did not observe accurately or there was a dramatic change in the three weeks before death or both.’
