Stealing: Global Radio Network boss Stephen Miron has accused the BBC of copying Classic FM's programme format

Their stock in trade is the soothing and the genteel.

However, Britain's two classical music radio stations are at the centre of an unseemly row over an 'aggressive' bid by BBC Radio 3 to steal Classic FM's listeners.

The popular commercial station claims that its BBC rival, which has overhauled its schedule over the last 18 months, has imitated a string of ideas: from listener phone-ins to request slots.

Stephen Miron, the boss of the Global Radio Network, which includes Classic FM, yesterday said that the BBC had been 'overtly' copying it by introducing changes.

Appearing at the Radio Conference in Salford, Mr Miron said: 'If you look at the changing programmes Radio 3 has done against Classic, it is pretty overt that it has looked at the successes that Classic has had and adjusted its programming structure.'

He added: 'It's now possible to listen to Radio 3 between 6:30am and 4:30pm and hear only one hour that's not presented by a former Classic FM presenter.

'Radio 3 has introduced listener requests on the phone every day - copying the format pioneered by Classic FM in classical music radio in the UK. 'If you look at what they're doing, it's what we've been doing for years.

'The BBC's whole remit is to provide distinct content in all they do, but it is increasingly replicating what is already catered for. And you can see why, because we have a much larger listenership.

'Radio 3 has aggressively pursued Classic FM and it uses its other platforms to cross-promote the station. They are absolutely trying to take our listeners.'

BBC Radio 3 has changed its schedule in the past 18 months in an attempt to broaden its appeal, but some listeners have complained that it increasingly sounds like rival network Classic FM.

The station has introduced a morning programme called Essential Classics, which has been compared to Classic FM's Hall of Fame that airs at the same time.

And its breakfast show has been criticised for relying too much on the audience to call, text or tweet in their views and take part in competitions.

Mr Miron said that most of the changes had been inspired by Classic FM.

He said: 'Radio 3's breakfast show is now made up short excerpts of classical music - instead of the full works it broadcast previously. That means less choice for the listeners.

'Classic FM launched a weekly classical CD sales chart when it launched in 1992. Radio 3 has copied this, launching its own chart.

'Radio 3's cut back on jazz 
programmes during the day - replacing them with classical music 
programmes and moving jazz mainly to late nights - reducing listener 
choice to compete with Classic FM head-on.

'Radio 3 now has more film soundtracks in its daytime programmes - particularly breakfast - copying Classic FM.'

Despite the changes, Radio 3's audience has only marginally increased. In figures released last month it had 2.15million listeners, up just over one per cent on the same time last year. At the same time Classic FM had 5.45million listeners.

Many Radio 3 
listeners have called for a return to 'pure and simple good music'.

Sarah
Spilsbury, from Friends of Radio 3, labelled the changes a case of 
cultural vandalism. While listeners said the new programmes were more 
'Radio 2.5' because of their reliance on audience participation.

One listener told Radio 4's Feedback: 'I finally switched off Breakfast this morning. Too ghastly for words. A DJ instead of a presenter, snippets of stuff from newspapers filling in the cracks, invitations to tweet, and bitty music, all of which I have heard a million times before.'

Others have accused the presenters of behaving like they had drunk too much caffeine.

Last year, governing body the BBC Trust told Radio 3 to 'extend its core appeal' but said it must do so without 'jeopardising distinctiveness'.

It said there were times when the station could sound 'heavy and inaccessible' and was viewed as 'elitist', before recommending that it should be more welcoming.

The station, which is predominantly listened to by those who are over 55, and middle class, was effectively told to find ways of finding younger and more minority audiences.

A BBC spokesman said: 'BBC national stations offer a distinctive range of programming with a strong public service focus which marks them out from commercial stations.

'Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 3 all organise big events and focus on speech, drama, live music, new music and music that has limited airplay elsewhere.

'We are always sensitive to leaving space for the commercial sector and we are delighted that companies such as Global continue to thrive.'
