The speed limit on one of Britain’s busiest motorways is to be cut from 70mph to 60mph under a controversial plan to meet European Union pollution targets.

The first ‘environmental’ speed limit is set to be imposed within months on a 32-mile stretch of the M1 – for seven days a week, from 7am to 7pm 

The limit will be in place for several years, and any driver caught breaking it faces a hefty fine and penalty points on their licence.

The Highways Agency said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway, and is ‘not ruled out’ on up to a dozen major routes. 

A busy stretch of the M3 near London is among those currently being assessed for anti-pollution measures.

Motoring groups said it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty.

And the restricted route will still be subject to variable speed limits to keep traffic flowing during congested periods, leading to regular caps of 50mph or 40mph.

The Highways Agency admitted it will be the first time a motorway speed limit has been cut on environmental rather than safety grounds, but insisted the plan was backed by ministers.

The limit will be enforced on the M1 from junction 28, near Matlock, Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham, South Yorkshire. 

Motorists will be able to drive at the standard 70mph on the rest of the M1, which runs from London to Leeds.

Criticism: AA President Edmund King has slammed the scheme - saying it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty

The restriction will apply from 7am to 7pm seven days a week and be enforced by speed cameras and police patrols. 

The route is part of a  £400million ‘smart’ motorway scheme, under which technology is used to manage traffic flow and the hard shoulder can be used to ease congestion.

It passes Mansfield, Chesterfield and Sheffield – and also includes nine so-called Air Quality Management Areas described as ‘pockets of poor air’. 

Although the Highways Agency said the lower speed limit will be in place until pollution dropped to acceptable levels, it admitted the 60mph restriction was likely to remain for several years.

It said a lower speed limit was needed to ensure new EU guidelines on air quality, which come into force this year, will be met.

Whitehall sources said last night that ‘a handful’ of other smart motorway schemes currently in the pipeline could have ‘green’ maximum speed limits imposed to meet air quality targets and avoid Brussels fines.

A section of the M3 from J2-4a near London is currently undergoing environmental assessment to see if measures will be needed to cut pollution levels.

Motoring groups reacted angrily to the plan, and warned of an alarming precedent and that wider use of the lower limit would have an impact on businesses.

AA President Edmund King said: ‘Billions spent on railways to speed up thousands of journeys while hundreds of millions spent on the M1 to slow down hundreds of thousands is an irony that won’t be lost on drivers.

‘Smart motorways were intended to ease congestion and improve journey time reliability through use of the hard shoulder. 

‘And here we have a scheme which costs around £400million to simply slow traffic down to 60mph with associated enforcement. Clearly we cannot have such a speed reduction when the M1 is empty.’ 

RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘Worryingly, this could pave the way for similar restrictions on other sections of motorway.

While preserving air quality is obviously a paramount concern there will inevitably be a negative impact on business efficiency and individual mobility.’ 

A Highways Agency consultation on the plan began yesterday and will close on March 3.
