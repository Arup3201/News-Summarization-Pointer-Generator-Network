This is the Transfer Column, where Sportsmail delivers the very latest news, gossip and rumours from around the football world three times a week.

In today's column, Sunderland striker Ji Dong-Won could make shock move to Borussia Dortmund, Beijing Guoan want West Ham striker Carlton Cole and Man City beat Man United to signing of Norwegian goalkeeper Kjetil Haug.

Sunderland striker Ji Dong-Won may not have settled into life in the North East but Borussia Dortmund are willing to give him a chance to revive his career in the Bundesliga.

The 22-year-old has shown flashes of what he is capable of in the Premier League including the winner against Manchester City on New Year's Day 2012 but it has been all too fleeting and not helped by an atmosphere of turmoil and change around teh Stadium of Light.

Continental drift: Sunderland striker Ji Dong-Won could make a shock move to the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund

A loan spell with German strugglers 
Augsburg earlier this year raised his profile again and Dortmund have 
seen enough in the South Korean to make Sunderland an offer.

A deal is expected to be agreed over the coming weeks with Ji having the benefit of not being cup-tied for the Champions League. Dortmund coach sees him as a player who can help soften the blow of Robert Lewandowski's pending departure.

Sunderland, meanwhile, are contemplating a move for Reading left-back Wayne Bridge. Manager Gus Poyet brought the best out of Bridge while at Brighton and is keen to solve a problem left-back position. The 33-year-old had a spell at Sunderland on loan from Manchester City in 2012 and may see it as a last shot at the Premier League even though Reading are in the play-off positions.

Poyet has also considered options in Italy including Parma's Djamel Mesbah, 29.

Beijing Guoan want West Ham striker Carlton Cole but need a quick answer from him before they move to other targets.

The Chinese are keen to bring high profile players to their league and will offer in the region of £2million a season.

Cole, 30, flirted with the prospect of moving to Turkey in the summer before he fought to get a contract back at West Ham. However, he has struggled to cement a regular place.

Andy Carroll is due to return and West Ham are continuing to look for new strikers. Beijing don't want transfer sagas of the past and are willing to move for Genoa's Alberto Gilardino should Cole not fancy the move.

Manchester City have beaten Manchester 
United to the signing of Norwegian junior goalkeeper Kjetil Haug. The 
15-year-old had trials at City and United earlier this season.

The 
Sarpsborg keeper has been likened to United legend and his idol Peter 
Schmeichel. His father, Cato Haug, told Dagbladet: 'I can confirm that 
Kjetil will move to Manchester City this summer.'

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce was in Spain on Sunday night to watch Atletico Madrid against Valencia.

Allardyce is in the market for two strikers and a centre-back but West Ham are trying to do all three as loans as they consider the future.

David Sullivan has already expressed concerns over the return on their £17million outlay for Andy Carroll and has to be realistic about their Premier League prospects.

Search is on: Nikica Jelavic is still on West Ham's radar, but Allardyce was in Spain looking at several others

Rather than risk further financial damages should they go down he wants to safeguard the situation by allowing short term deals with the potential to change in the summer.

Allardyce left the stands at Vicente Calderon after 45 minutes with the latest player brought to his attention being Valencia's Jonas.

Full name Jonas Goncalves Oliveira, the Brazilian is an important figure in Valencia's squad but they are willing to sell players as they continue to redress their own financial troubles - compounded by failure to qualify for the Champions League.

Valencia want £5.3million for the 29-year-old so unless they relent on that stance a deal seems unlikely with West Ham's current policy.

Value: Valencia want £5.3million for the 29-year-old as they continue to redress financial problems

The same applies for Southampton's Rickie Lambert and Kenwyne Jones of Stoke with both commanding fees.

Everton's Nikica Jelavic remains at the forefront of their thinking, while Nantes' Filip Djordjevic and Anzhi's giant Lacina Traore are other names that have been discussed.

Allardyce has also asked for checks on defenders with Porto's Abdoulaye Ba, currently on loan with Guimaraes and Lorient's Lamine Kone among the candidates. Kone, 24, has also been watched by Sunderland and Hull City.

 

Hull's hopes of signing Celtic striker Georgios Samaras have improved after he was asked to take a pay cut by the Glasgow club. The 29-year-old is out of contract in the summer and free to talk to foreign clubs from January.

It is understood that Celtic have made him an offer but it would mean his basic pay being cut from £16,000 per week to £14,000. Hull can certainly better that and Steve Bruce will be weighing up an offer over the coming days as he mulls over different targets for his attack.

Here and there: Georgios Samaras could be on his way back to the Premier League with Hull City

 

Rennes winger Jonathan Pitroipa is catching the eye of a few Premier League clubs. The Burkina Faso flyer was voted player of the tournament at the African Nations Cup and has already attracted Southampton, West Brom and Fulham this season.

Which
 Premier League secretary was sitting very uncomfortably when he found 
out the club's new x-ray and medical scanning room would be situated 
directly under his office?

Voicing his fear that radiation would seep 
through, the company fitting the equipment duly obliged by applying lead
 lining to the ceiling of the newly-fitted room at the club's training 
ground.

Newcastle are due to watch Rennes on Wednesday against Bordeaux and the 27-year-old will be keen to impress. However, another player Newcastle will watch closely is developing defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko who has drawn scouts from Everton, Chelsea and Manchester United.

The 19-year-old Paris-born player is in his debut season for the first team but looks a star in the making. Chelsea and United watched him on Saturday but also took the opportunity to run the rule over PSG ahead of the Champions League draw and to weigh up any players who may become available from their squad.

Shifter: PSG are trying to sign Juventus' Paul Pogba, which could lead to a merry go round

PSG are trying to sign former United midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus and that could lead to others leaving Paris. Blaise Matuidi, Ezequiel Lavezzi and the small, but very effective, Marco Verratti are all considering their futures and would fit the Premier League well.

Newcastle, who remain keen on Everton target, Spartak Moscow's Aiden McGeady, will tie up Wednesday's scouting mission on Rennes by watching Nice also over the coming days.

 

Dundee United have given an contract extension to teenager Ryan Gauld amid ongoing speculation he could yet leave Tannadice. Manchester United sent three scouts to watch the 17-year-old last week to compile reports while Roma, Juventus, Arsenal, Liverpool, Sunderland and Cardiff have also been among the visiting scouts monitoring his progress and that of teammates John Souttar, Andy Robertson and Stuart Armstrong who signed a new three year deal last week.

Prospect: Dundee have given Gauld a contract extension to warn off those interested in the young star

 

Carles Puyol is considering retirement from a persistent knee injury which is accentuating Barcelona's need for a centre-back. David Luiz of Chelsea remains a name in the frame but Barca have also sent scouts to South America to weigh up cheaper targets.

Sporting Lisbon are showing interest in Newcastle's Dan Gosling. The 23-year-old has been on loan at Blackpool and was expecting to continue there for the rest of the season.

Huddersfield Town have taken Guiseley's Ben Whitfield on trial.

Fulham are considering reviving interest in Sporting Lisbon forward Zakaria Labyad. The 20-year-old Morocco international shot to prominence while at PSV Eindhoven where Chelsea and Arsenal sent scouts to check his progress.

However, he moved to Sporting Lisbon under controversial circumstances, with PSV claiming he had broken his contract, but has failed to make any real impression and is looking for a fresh start. Rene Meulensteen has a limited budget but is looking for a striker and a centre-back. Labyad was a target for Martin Jol last summer and could go out on loan but Meulensteen may want a greater physical presence.

Return? Fulham continue to attempt to bring former forward Clint Dempsey back to the club for the US off-season

Fulham are continuing to work on a loan for former striker Clint Dempsey at Seattle but Stoke, Everton and West Ham have also asked.

We mentioned Anderlecht's interest in Bryan Ruiz last week and meetings are ongoing over that deal but there still remains a difference on valuation with the Belgians coming up short so far. A request to take Ruiz on loan for £1million is not what Fulham were looking for.

Rotherham were the only club that had made an enquiry to take Jon Flanagan on loan from Liverpool this season. Sportsmail understands
 though that in the week before Jose Enrique's injury, Preston North End
 asked if they could take him. Manager Brendan Rodgers said he couldn't 
afford to let him go and Flanagan, 20, took his first team chance at 
Liverpool instead.

No interest: Rotherham were the only side to make a loan offer for Flanagan

 

The departures of Steve Clarke and Andre Villas-Boas could have bearings on Manchester United transfer exits this January. Clarke was keen on United winger Wilfried Zaha and West Bromwich Albion was understood to be United's preference as long as they got someone else in to replace the England U21 international.

Newcastle, Cardiff, Stoke and Everton have also expressed interest. Tottenham's change in manager may affect the future of United's Luis Nani and Javier Hernandez who were both on the list of Villas-Boas. Hernandez, who was injured in training on Saturday, has failed to kick on this season when United needed him to and, if they can find another striker, they may well listen to offers.
