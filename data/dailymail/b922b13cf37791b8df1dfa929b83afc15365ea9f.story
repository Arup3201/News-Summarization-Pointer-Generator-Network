Manchester United and Liverpool are set to go head-to-head this summer to sign William Carvalho.

The Sporting Lisbon midfielder has a £35million get-out clause in his contract, though changes to third party ownership could see his price drop by around £10m.

However, the action between the two Premier League giants could mean his value surpasses the £30m mark.

Liverpool see Carvalho as the ideal player to replace the departing Steven Gerrard.

Equally, United have eyes for him to shore up a midfield which has lacked an enforcer this season.

Arsenal are still confident of landing Morgan Schneiderlin this summer. The French midfielder is rated in the £25m category.

His club Southampton have offered him a new £60,000-a-week deal to stay at the club.

But the Gunners will raise the bar on salary and more than likely offer Champions League football.

Sources in France tell the Football Grapevine that Schneiderlin wants to join the Gunners.

Manchester City’s hopes of signing £60m-rated Paul Pogba from Juventus could be dashed this summer because of the emerging interest of Barcelona.

President Marc Bartomeu is lining up an audacious move, despite the Catalan giants’ transfer ban.

Sunderland will move in for Sam Allardyce should he - as it seems likely - leave West Ham in the summer.

Whatever the outcome of their season it appears the Black Cats will part company with Gus Poyet.

The Football Grapevine understands Besiktas boss Slave Bilic is high on West Ham’s ‘long list’, along with Michael Laudrup and Frank Rijkaard.

Steve Bruce is set to leave Hull City this summer. Fulham and Wigan are two possible destinations.

Roy Hodgson will restore Wayne Rooney to his favoured role of lead striker when England play Lithuania in the Euro 16 qualifier at the end of the month.

Rooney has been moved around the Manchester United team this season, even playing deep in midfield under Louis van Gaal.

But Hodgson still believes Rooney’s position is as a front man even though he has used him in differing roles.

It remains to be seen though if Rooney can justify his place in the national team and not just be picked because he is captain, especially given the emergence of Tottenham’s Harry Kane as a contender for the central striker role.

Indeed, suddenly Hodsgon has plenty of options up front with QPR’s Charlie Austin and Burnley’s Danny Ings also candidates with Kane and Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge to challenge Rooney for the ‘No 9’ role.

I am also hearing

Reports of a deep rift between Man United boss Louis van Gaal and assistant Ryan Giggs may be exaggerated but Football Grapevine hears there have been differences of opinion with regard to tactics, not least the use of Wayne Rooney.

This time last year FG reported that if David Moyes was ousted, Giggs would take charge until the end of the season.

That happened.

FG hears it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that Giggs will be United’s next boss.

How soon? That depends on how LVG negotiates the remainder of this season.

The day after the Football Association appointed Martin Glenn as their new chief executive, Roy Hodgson announced he wanted his contract extended for at least two years to take in the 2018 World Cup finals.

It would seem Hodgson, or perhaps someone who advises him on PR matters, thought it was good timing to state his case.

Whatever the reason it could well backfire on Hodgson.

Roy Hodgson has announced he wants to extend his contract with England for at least another two years

After all, on what grounds does Hodgson think he has earned the right to a new deal ?

Yes, England are well on the way to qualifying for the finals of Euro 2016, but in a very weak group.

And does he think people have forgotten last summer’s lamentable display at the World Cup?

England’s dire performances in Brazil encouraged scathing comments towards Hodgson from BBC's main man Gary Lineker.

And here’s the thing.

Lineker is a pal of Glenn.

Why? Because Head of Walkers Glenn offered former England skipper Lineker a lucrative career in advertising crisps.

Indeed, Lineker lauded the appointment of Glenn. 

Food industry boss Martin Glenn (left, with Gary Lineker in 2000) has been named the FA's new chief 

The only way Hodgson, who is 67 by the way, should continue as boss is if the team reach at least the semi-finals at the Euros.

Of course the obvious question then is who to replace him.

Given his strong views on football over the last 20 years from the comfort of the pundit sofa after a great International career, it might just be that Glenn persuades Lineker to put his money where his mouth is.

BTW

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has suggested that Steven Gerrard’s ‘dream’ of leading out Liverpool in this year's FA Cup final as a last hurrah before moving to LA Galaxy is not guaranteed.

Quite. After all the Reds have got to get there first. Sunday’s quarter-final tie against Blackburn may seem a shoo-in for Liverpool but any manager tempts fate when they look too far ahead. Especially in the cup.

That said, Liverpool look well placed to go all the way to Wembley this season.

Steven Gerrard is back training but won't walk straight into the Liverpool team, according to Brendan Rodgers

With Gerrard in mind, Rodgers was spot on when he said: ‘No player has a God given right to walk into the team.’

Indeed Liverpool have played their best football and have picked up points since Gerrard was ruled out of action with a hamstring injury.

Moreover, Liverpool’s revival this season has coincided when Gerrard ended all the speculation about his future and said he would leave the club and join LA Galaxy

In a sense that liberated the rest of the players… not least Jordan Henderson.

Squads can’t live under the shadow of an ageing star. Even that time will come for Barcelona and Lionel Messi.

There comes a point when even the best players, club legends, can end up overshadowing the squad and thus undermining the team evolving into a new era.

Bill Shankly was a master at moving on stars and refreshing the team. So was Bob Paisley.

And of course at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson did the same.

It would seem Rodgers realised that offering Gerrard two more years at Liverpool was more sentimental than pragmatic and thus detrimental to the club moving on up under his watch.

That is a sign of good management and may in a few years time see Liverpool achieve what they never did in the ‘Stevie G era’. Win the Premier League title.

iBet 

The Champions League resumes this week.

Chelsea are 8-1 to win the trophy. Given the way the beat West Ham 1-0 last week when overrun in the second half suggest they have the mettle and desire and even the luck to go all the way.

The Treble Lite is on for the Blues.
