The polygamist family stars of TV show Sister Wives have won a legal victory after a federal judge ruled on Friday that key parts of Utah's polygamy laws are unconstitutional.

Kody Brown and his four wives had fled Utah for Las Vegas last year, under the threat of prosecution.

But yesterday, U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups said in the ruling that the phrase in Utah law that forbids cohabitation with another person was a violation of the First Amendment.

Attorney Jonathan Turley has said that the Brown family had drawn the attention of Utah authorities because of their TLC hit series.

The family filed their lawsuit in July 2011, before leaving for Las Vegas last year. Mr Turley, who is based in Washington DC, argued the case before Judge Waddoups in January.

Utah's bigamy law is stricter than the laws in 49 other states - most of which prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses.

Utah makes it illegal to even purport to be married to multiple partners or live together.

The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Judge Waddoups took a narrow interpretation of the words 'marry' and 'purports to marry' in his ruling.

That means that bigamy remains illegal in Utah only in the literal sense, such as when someone fraudulently acquires more than one marriage license.

'The decision affects a far greater range of such relationships than the form of polygamy practiced by the Browns,' Mr Turley said on Friday. 'It is a victory not for polygamy but privacy in America.'

Utah officials had sought to have the suit thrown out. They first argued that the Browns couldn't challenge the bigamy law because they hadn't been charged.

State attorneys later argued for dismissal because a prosecutor had pledged not to prosecute them for bigamy.

But Judge Waddoups wrote in a 2012 ruling that the promise from the Utah County Attorney's Office appeared to be a ploy to avoid the suit.

Mr Brown said in a statement yesterday that the family was 'humbled and grateful' for the ruling.

'While we know that many people do not approve of plural families, it is our family and based on our beliefs,' he said.

'Just as we respect the personal and religious choices of other families, we hope that in time all of our neighbors and fellow citizens will come to respect our own choices.'
