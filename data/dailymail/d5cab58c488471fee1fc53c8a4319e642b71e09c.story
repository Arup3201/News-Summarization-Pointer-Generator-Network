Sir Mick Jagger has found comfort in the arms of a mystery brunette, it was reported last night.

The Rolling Stones singer was pictured smiling and obviously enjoying life again on his hotel balcony with an attractive young woman, sparking speculation he may have a new girlfriend.

Sir Mick, 70, was left distraught when his partner of 13 years, L’Wren Scott, killed herself in her Manhattan apartment in March aged 49.

The Stones were forced to cancel their Australian tour as a result of the tragedy.

At the time, Sir Mick, who was pictured looking drawn and unwell, told fans in a statement he was ‘shocked and devastated’.

He said: ‘We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves.’ Sir Mick described his partner, a fashion designer, as having ‘had great presence’, adding: ‘Her talent was much admired, not least  by me.’

The new pictures suggest he is finally putting the tragedy behind him and attempting to move on with his life. He was photographed on the balcony of his penthouse suite in Switzerland with a brunette several decades younger than him.

According to The Sun, which published the pictures, the pair met in a Zurich nightclub last weekend and spent two days together. They were seen on Saturday morning smiling and looking carefree. In the afternoon, Sir Mick reportedly emerged from his room bare-chested to speak on the phone.

The couple appeared again on Saturday night, with Sir Mick wearing a striped shirt and the woman clutching a drink.

A source in Zurich told The Sun: ‘He’s worked very hard to get the Stones back on the road. He’s a single man and he’s Mick and he’s having some fun.’ The Stones spent four days in the Swiss city as part of their  world tour.

Sir Mick and Keith Richards, 70, Ronnie Wood, 67, and Charlie Watts, 73, are due to play at the Pinkpop Festival in Holland  this evening.

The band resumed their world tour in Norway at the end of May  after cancelling shows following Miss Scott’s death.

Her body was discovered in her Manhattan apartment by her assistant at around 10am on March 17.

It emerged after her death that the fashion label she founded  had been heavily in debt.

Sir Mick has said previously that he failed ‘to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way’.

He said that the couple had spent ‘many wonderful  years together’.
