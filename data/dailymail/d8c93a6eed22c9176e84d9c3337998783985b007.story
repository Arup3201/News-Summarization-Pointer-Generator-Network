During the pre-debate chatter on CNN, Democratic political consultant Paul Begala used colorful description when hypothesizing how nervous the two candidates were as they waited to take the stage.

'(They're) nervous like a hooker in church!' he said on CNN just minutes before the vice presidential debate in Danville, Kentucky.

After being met with a quick laughter from his fellow commentators, one of them responded 'I must be going to the wrong church!'

Begala made his name in politics by working as a chief strategist for the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton and his running mate Al Gore in 1992.

He has since spent much of his time advising others on their political aspirations and talking about said strategies on television.

The colorful comment comes as little surprise given Begala's close connection to another lively commentator, James 'The Raging Cajun' Carville.

While 69 million people watched the vice presidential debate in 2008, far fewer than that are thought to have been watching CNN when the comment was made due to the network's decreased viewership.

CNN has had a well-noted tumble in the ratings in recent months, as The Huffington Post reports that the network's primetime viewership is down 41 per cent in August as compared to the same month the previous year.
