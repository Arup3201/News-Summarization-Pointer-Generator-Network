A British Army sergeant major punched a married soldier three times after finding one of his female gunners in his bed and taking 15 photos to document the evidence, a court heard.

Warrant Officer 2 Martin Holder intervened after allegedly finding Lance Bombardier Sarah White under the covers of Colour Sergeant James Kelt's bunk following an alcohol-fuelled night out during a training exercise in Germany.

The 50-year-old immediately started taking photos of the pair, which he claimed he would use as evidence to prove they had 'breached' the standards and values of the army.

The court heard Lance Bombadier White worked in WO2 Holder's store room and he believed the situation with a superior - who was three ranks above her - brought the force into disrepute. 

The three were all based at the prestigious Sandhurst Royal Military Academy in Camberley, Surrey, when the incident unfolded, the court was told.

In one of the photos shown to the court, Colour Sergeant Kelt, of 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (2 Scots), can be seen holding the green duvet over his head.

Bulford Military Court in Wiltshire heard how Colour Sergeant Kelt, 33, 'jumped from the bed' and began heading towards Sergeant Major Holder, who he told the court punched him three times.

After the incident, WO2 Holder was charged with assault. But he walked free from court today after the judge directed the court martial panel to find him not guilty.

WO2 Holder had always claimed he acted in self defence after Colour Sergeant Kelt allegedly came towards him 'aggressively'.

Colour Sergeant Kelt admitted it was him and Lance Bombardier White who had been captured in the photos, but he denied that they ever got under the covers together.

The court heard how the soldiers were in Hohenfels Camp, Germany, in November last year when the drama unfolded.

They were at the end of their last exercise with Sandhurst and had gone out to celebrate at a bar on the U.S side of the barracks.

In one of the photos shown to the court - taken by WO2 Holder to use as 'evidence' - Colour Sergeant Kelt can be seen holding the duvet over his head, in a bid to stop the photos being taken

At around 12.30am on November 24, WO2 Holder, Col Sgt Kelt and L/Bdr White returned to their accommodation.

After WO2 Holder went to bed, Col Sgt Kelt and L/Bdr White had a cigarette together before White entered the male block and got into a bed in the dark room.

Col Sgt Kelt joined her shortly after, the court heard.

On recognising the voices, WO2 Holder - who has since retired from the army after 30 years' service - rose from his bed to confront the pair and discipline his employee.

He later claimed he took the pictures as evidence of their 'breach of values and standards' of the army.

Opening the case, Captain James Norman told the court: 'The prosecution say that the defendant assaulted Kelt by punching him three times in the face and that by doing so he caused a wound to his face in the small hours.

'Holder and the complainant were both on the directing staff at RMAS. Shortly after having arrived back at the camp Kelt and White ended up together in the male accommodation.

'A short time afterwards, Holder got out of his bed and left the room. He returned a few moments later, turned on the light and took photos of Col Sgt Kelt and Bdr White.

'The complainant jumped from the bed and confronted Holder, who then punched him three times in the face and as a result the complainant suffered cuts to his upper right lip which required sutures.

'He felt that what he saw was a breach of service as both soldiers were married. He said that his intention had been to take photos of them as evidence of them.' 

When the brawl erupted, other men sleeping in the 60-space accommodation room were forced to intervene, the court heard.

Staff Sergeant Ian Ruffle told the court he had seen L/Bdr White on her back on Col Sgt Kelt's bed.

'L/Bdr White was clearly lying on the bed, she was on her back and awake, Col Sgt Kelt was at the bottom of the bed,' he told the court.

'After the few punches were thrown she got quite verbal towards WO2 Holder. She was definitely awake and lying on her back.' 

Giving evidence in court, Colour Sergeant Kelt admitted it was his hand in the photographs and that the woman pictured was L/Bdr White. 

But Col Sgt Kelt maintains he remained sat on the bed next to the woman having a conversation and did not at any point get under the covers with her.

He told the court he had changed into his nightwear after returning to the dorm from the bowling alley, where he had downed six or seven bottles of Budweiser.

He said got out of bed when the lights went on and asked Holder, who was holding a grey wind-up camera in his hand, what he was doing, when he was punched in the face.  

The three were all based at the country's prestigious military institution, the Sandhurst Royal Military Academy, in Camberley, Surrey (pictured)

He said: 'I didn't come back to the room alone, L/Bdr White was with me but she was sat on the other side of the bed.

'When I got up my immediate response was probably to say something along the lines of "what are you doing", and I then walked towards him.

'I think I might have got a bit too close to him and he struck me. He was trying to take my picture and he flung the first punch.

'I was probably angry, I didn't advance towards him in a manner of aggression, I just wanted to put a barrier between L/Bdr White and WO2 Holder.

'It put me back a few steps, I would say it was his full force. He was clearly angry and upset, I could see the anger in his face.

'He was clearly in a state of agitation and rage. At one stage White managed to get past and out of the door, and I grabbed a towel to stem the blood flowing from my face.'

He added: 'I was not under the covers, I was sitting at the head of the bed, at no stage do I recall seeing her in that [lying down] position.'  

An RAF serviceman who was lying awake in his bed after the night out on the American side of the camp said he had been smoking outside with L Bdr White and Col Sgt Kelt before the incident at around 12.30am.

He recalled: 'White went inside before we came in and when I went into the room she was lying on top of Kelt's bed.'

Judge Advocate Michael Elson instructed the panel of three to draw a conclusion of not guilty after the prosecution made the decision to offer no evidence halfway through the trial.

He told them: 'The prosecution have decided to offer no further evidence in this case. It would be wrong for me to allow the case to go any further.

'I must direct you to the only finding appropriate, the one of not guilty.' 

Sandhurst, in Camberley, Surrey, is where all army officers are trained to lead soldiers.

It was founded in 1741 and counts Prince Harry, Prince William and Prince Edward among its alumni.

Sgt Major Holder denied one charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the grounds of self defence.
