An Elvis fan took his family straight to McDonald's and started planning his dream trip to Graceland after scooping more than £4million in the National Lottery.

David Hendry, 45, and his wife Donna, 44, from Edinburgh won the jackpot in Wednesday's triple rollover draw - on what would have been the King of Rock and Roll's 80th birthday.

The couple took their Vauxhall Astra  for an MOT and said they are planning to move house and take a few family holidays with their 12-year-old son, including a trip to Memphis.

Mr Hendry said: 'I checked the winning numbers on my mobile phone as usual, to see whether I'd won anything. It was 6.30am and my wife Donna and our son were in the house. I knew immediately I had won the jackpot as I knew the numbers off by heart.

'I told Donna first, who obviously didn't believe me until I showed her our ticket. We then told our son Lewis who was flabbergasted, especially when he saw the full amount we had won. It is his birthday next week, so I think he's already thought of a lot of extra presents he would like.

'I love Elvis so maybe a trip to Graceland could be on the cards.'

The sales engineer, who works for cooling company Fenn Tool Limited, placed his numbers at a local post office three weeks in advance so he wouldn't miss any draws over the festive period.

'I tried not to say too much to anyone at the garage as I was still in shock and I didn't want to blurt it out - we've still only told a few people so far, until now,' he said.

Mr Hendry and his wife, a commercial executive for Johnson & Johnson, said they have yet to decide whether to give up work.

'It's been 21 years in November since we've been putting the numbers on,' he said.

'The car passed its MOT. I don't honestly know at this time what car I'll get next. I've got a family so it might be a family car.

'It's too early to say what we are going to do with the money, and it's a lot to take in. It's got to look after us for the rest of our lives.

'Some of the family members know and some of my close friends know but that's it. It is just a bit of a whirlwind.' 

The winning numbers were 4, 5, 10, 12, 20 and 23 and the bonus ball was 24. Another ticket also matched the winner numbers, netting its owner £4,078,509 too.
