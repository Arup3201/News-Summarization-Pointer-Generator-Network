Panic was growing in Labour ranks last night as a poll suggested the party will face an electoral wipeout at the hands of the Scottish nationalists.

Calls were growing for Labour’s Scottish MPs – including its election chief Douglas Alexander – to abandon Westminster and head north to try to save their seats.

Long-awaited polling of key Scottish constituencies yesterday confirmed Labour’s worst fears, suggesting the SNP is on course for landslide victories May.

Some of the biggest names in Scottish politics face losing their seats, undermining Ed Miliband’s hopes of a Commons majority.

Mr Alexander, the Shadow Foreign Secretary and Margaret Curran, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, are among those heading for defeat. 

In all, Lord Ashcroft’s polling suggested an average swing from Labour to the SNP of 25 per cent – a shift not seen in modern political history.

That would mean the SNP snatching 35 of the 41 seats Labour won in 2010, leaving them humiliated in a traditional heartland.

It also means the SNP is likely to hold the balance of power in a hung Parliament.

Polls show that Margaret Curran, left, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, and Anas Sarwar, right are headed for defeat 

Other likely casualties include Labour’s former deputy leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, whose majority in Glasgow Central is currently more than 10,000.

Labour rising stars Gemma Doyle and Pamela Nash both face losing in West Dunbartonshire and Airdrie and Shotts.

The findings are equally grim for the Liberal Democrats – with a pitiful 12 per cent of voters who backed the party in 2010 saying they will do so again.

In Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander faces disaster, with a 25.5 per cent swing against him predicted.

Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy cancelled a planned photocall in the wake of the poll results.

Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy insisted the main beneficiaries of an SNP surge are the Conservatives, who will be more likely to secure power at Westminster

He insisted the main beneficiaries of an SNP surge are the Conservatives, who will be more likely to secure power at Westminster.

He said: ‘These polls show that Scottish Labour is well behind and has a big gap to close.

‘But in the end the only people who will benefit from these polls are David Cameron and the Tories.

‘It is a simple fact that the single biggest party gets to form the next government.

‘The more seats the SNP get from Labour, the more likely it is the Tories will be the biggest party and David Cameron will get into government through the back door.’

Labour strategists are desperately hoping that talking up the prospect of another Tory-led government will persuade some of their former voters to come home.

They also believe that some of the 400,000 voters who backed the Conservatives in 2010 might be prepared to vote tactically to stop the SNP.

However, Lord Ashcroft’s polling indicated that the SNP’s pitch to voters since losing last year’s independence referendum – vote SNP to ensure a strong Scottish presence at Westminster – is resonating.

‘The single most popular general election outcome in these seats was a coalition involving Labour and the SNP – a result favoured by 39 per cent of voters overall, including 62 per cent of SNP supporters and 79 per cent of Labour-SNP switchers,’ said Lord Ashcroft.

‘Huge swings to the SNP in national polls suggest that even some MPs who must have thought they had a job for life are threatened.

‘If a swing to the SNP… were to be repeated across the board next May it would endanger 35 of Labour’s 41 seats in Scotland.’

SNP general election campaign director Angus Robertson said: ‘These polls include some of Labour’s safest seats in the whole of the UK as well as Scotland, and they are clearly excellent for the SNP - but we are taking absolutely nothing for granted, and will work hard for every vote and seat in May.

‘These seat-by-seat polls also underline the extent to which Labour are paying a huge price for their toxic referendum alliance with the Tories - which to all intents and purposes has continued.

‘People can only make Scotland’s priorities Westminster’s priorities by voting SNP in May.’ 

Some shadow ministers are understood to be pressuring Labour leader Ed Miliband to publicly rule out any post-election deal with the SNP, led by Nicola Sturgeon, pictured 

The research was conducted in January among 16,000 voters in 16 Scottish constituencies – 14 currently held by Labour, mostly in areas with a strong support for independence, and two held by the LibDems.

Swings to the SNP in Labour-held seats ranged from 21 per cent in Airdrie and Shotts to 27 per cent in Motherwell and Wishaw and Dundee West.

In Labour-held seats, just 60 per cent of Scots who backed the party in 2010 voters said they would do so again in May.

Some shadow ministers are understood to be pressuring Mr Miliband to publicly rule out doing any post-election deal with the SNP to reinforce the argument that voting for the Nationalists will increase the likelihood of a Tory Government.

Others back calls led by Mr Murphy for the party’s Scottish MPs to ‘forget’ Westminster and return to their seats to spend as much time as possible campaigning before the general election.
