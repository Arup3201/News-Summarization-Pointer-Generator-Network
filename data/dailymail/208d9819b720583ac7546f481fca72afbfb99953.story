The Scots and Northern Irish are happier than the English and the Welsh, David Cameron's well-being survey has concluded.

It found 29 per cent of those in England and Wales gave themselves low happiness ratings, against 28.8 per cent of Scots and 26 per cent of people in Northern Ireland.

And those living in the Orkneys, the Shetlands and the Western Isles were the happiest of all, the survey's first annual report has shown.

The islanders gave their happiness level eight out of ten, and fewer than one in six gave low scores for life satisfaction.

London and Birmingham were the most miserable cities while York was the happiest, with 83 per cent of its residents reporting medium or high satisfaction with life.

The survey found that the middle-aged are the unhappiest people in the country.

They are at the bottom of a U-shaped pattern of national happiness, while the young and the retired each came at the top.

Good results: Pensioners and teenagers are the happiest in Britain, according to results of a Government survey released today, which is costing £2 million

The report, 
released yesterday, found that those in their 40s and 50s were 
unhappier, more dissatisfied and more likely to feel anxious than 
teenagers or pensioners.

The £2million-a-year inquiry into 
Britain’s emotional well-being was commissioned by Mr Cameron and 
carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Happy bunny: David Cameron wants to find out how Britons really feel so the Government can do a better job

It has already been criticised for 
some of its initial findings, including the rather predictable 
conclusions that the employed are happier than the unemployed and those 
who suffer poor health are more anxious than those in good health.

Yesterday a Labour spokesman said: 
‘This is a statement of the bleeding obvious, a waste of taxpayers’ 
money and it makes ministers look even more out of touch.’

The 165,000 participants were asked 
how happy and anxious they felt the day before, how satisfied they were 
with life and how worthwhile they thought their lives were.

The findings show that the middle-aged are the worst-off generation in terms of well-being.

‘Research has shown a U-shaped relationship between life satisfaction ratings and age group,’ the report said.

‘Overall higher ratings of subjective
well-being are reported by younger and older people, and lower ratings 
are reported by those in the middle years.’

Men and women aged between 45 and 54 rated their life satisfaction at 7.1 out of ten.

By contrast, teenagers and those between 65 and 80 marked themselves at 7.8 out of ten.

When it came to anxiety, the U-shape 
was turned upside down. Nearly a quarter of those aged between 45 and 60
gave an anxiety rating of six out of ten.

But bearing a greater level of responsibility gave the middle-aged a sense their lives were worthwhile.

Ros Altmann, of Saga, the over-50s 
group,  said: ‘Those coming up to traditional retirement age are clearly
more anxious and less satisfied with their lives than those already 
retired.

‘Once they are retired, perhaps people adjust to their circumstances and make the best of things.’

Lord O'Donnell, the former Cabinet Secretary behind the survey, said the results showed it is 'bliss' to work outdoors.

He added that the findings proved it isn't just money that matters.

'If you are working in forestry, or in agriculture, then you really are close to bliss,' he said.

On average, Britons rated life satisfaction at 7.4 out of ten. Those who were married were the most satisfied, with 82 per cent recording medium to high levels.

Cohabitees came next, on 79.4 per cent, followed by single people, on 71.2 per cent, and the divorced, on 60.7 per cent.

But the ONS said it was 'difficult to say' whether marriage makes people happier, or happier people are more likely to marry.

The report said that ministers intend to use its findings to help direct Government spending towards people with low levels of well-being.

Glenn Everett, head of the Measuring National Well-Being Programme, said: 'By examining and analysing both objective statistics as well as subjective information, a more complete picture of national well-being can be formed.

'Understanding people's views of well-being is an important addition to existing official statistics and has potential uses in the policy making process.'
