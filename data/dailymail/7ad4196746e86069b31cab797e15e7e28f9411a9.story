Arsene Wenger has hit back at critics of record signing Mesut Ozil.

Arsenal's £42.5million man was poor as they were taken apart by Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in midweek, but Wenger has defended the forward and insists he has every faith in him.

'It’s a bit unfair because I believe that our offensive talents on Tuesday night [against Borussia Dortmund] were not in their best condition, and they couldn’t express that talent,' said Wenger.

'On the other hand it’s post-World Cup. He came back on August 11. You know it takes a few months for them to get back to their best, that can happen.

'They should not be concerned and just support him. I understand that you want your best players always to make the difference in every single game and we all go through period where we are a bit less good. You help.

'A club is a union between players, supporters and directors. You have to be united and sometimes go through periods together where it goes a bit less well.'

It has been suggested that the formation Arsenal are currently playing, with Ozil often playing out on the right, does not suit the German's talents. But Wenger believes that is merely a side issue. 

'That's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants,' he added. 'If you look at the heat map where he plays, you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch. 

'Why should be be a scapegoat? For what? We've lost one game since April 1. Let's be realistic. We've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games. We had very difficult games against Besiktas. I don't know a scapegoat for what?

'What is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game. You have to accept that football is played by human beings who have ups and downs like you have in your life.'

Wenger revealed that Mathieu Debuchy will undergo an exploratory operation on his ankle injury this evening which will determine how long he is out for.

If he does not need further surgery, it will be six weeks before his return, but if he needs to go under the knife it will rule him out for at least three months.

'We’ll know tonight [Friday]. He has an exploration of his ankle tonight and they go in and look how the ligament is damaged, and after that we know if he does need surgery. 

'If he doesn’t, it’ll be six weeks, if he does need surgery it’ll be three months. At the moment we don’t know.'
