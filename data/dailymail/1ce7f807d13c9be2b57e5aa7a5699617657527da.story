Tory Cabinet Minister Iain Duncan Smith has risked a diplomatic row by predicting that French immigrants will pour into Britain if a socialist president is elected today.

The Work and Pensions Secretary warned that Left-wing candidate Francois Hollande’s high tax policies would drive hard-pressed French taxpayers across the Channel.

Mr Hollande, favourite to beat French President Nicolas Sarkozy in today’s final round of the presidential election, has pledged to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent.

Slim hope: Nicolas Sarkozy, left, was just four points away his rival Francoise Hollande in the final opinion poll

But former Tory leader Mr Duncan Smith
said: ‘If Hollande comes in now to spend huge amounts of money, raising
it from taxpayers, he will put a further burden on the taxpayers of 
France.

‘London is already one of the largest 
French cities in Europe and I think an awful lot of French people will 
want to come to London.’

The capital is often referred to as 
France’s sixth city due to its huge expatriate population, including 
more than 70,000 French voters who were courted by Mr Hollande on a 
campaign trip in February.

Warning: Iain Duncan Smith believes French presidential candidate Francoise Holland would 'put a further burden' on French taxpayers if voted in

Estate agents in London are already reporting increased interest in properties from French clients.

Mr Duncan Smith also seized on Mr 
Hollande’s desire to promote spending over austerity and renegotiate the
Brussels pact imposing budget discipline on eurozone countries.

He said: ‘Francois Hollande says he’s 
going to come out and spend money. He’s going to raise tax and do 
everything he says that will suddenly change the French economy.

‘That will have a shockwave effect in 
Europe. It could cause major ructions with Germany, and the European 
Central Bank could find itself in difficulty.’

Mr Duncan Smith’s intervention comes 
amid suggestions that David Cameron will have to build bridges with Mr 
Hollande, if he wins, after failing to meet him during a campaign trip 
to London.

Ahead of today’s contest, all polls 
suggested Mr Hollande, a self-proclaimed ‘enemy of finance’, is set to 
beat Right-wing rival Mr Sarkozy.

The latest poll showed the socialist’s
lead narrowing at 52-48, but those four points would be enough to see 
the 57-year-old become France’s first socialist head of state for 17 
years.

Mr Sarkozy has said Mr Hollande ‘would
lead France to bankruptcy’ and branded him ‘a liar’ during a live TV 
debate last week.

In return, Mr Hollande has portrayed the President as 
an increasingly extreme Right-wing opportunist who is interested only in
looking after the rich. Mr Sarkozy, also 57, was today at the Paris 
home of his wife, Carla Bruni, with their six-month-old baby, Giulia.

Close: Mr Hollande, pictured visiting a street market in Tulle with his partner Valerie Trierweiler, is tipped to be the first Socialist leader in two decades after 46million people cast their vote today

Hope: Mr Hollande is greeted by a florist as he visits a street market in Tulle, where he served as mayor

Nervous: Mr Hollande said he was anxious for victory as he wandered though the market

Popular: A cheese seller greets Mr Hollande in the town where he is popular

Mr Hollande, meanwhile, was in his 
constituency, Tulle, central France, with his girlfriend, Valerie 
Trierweiler.

She will become the first unmarried Premiere Dame in French
history if Mr Hollande is elected.

Mr Hollande won the first round of the
election two weekends ago, with 28.63 per cent of the votes compared 
with 27.18 per cent for Mr Sarkozy.

Voting begins: French citizens living in Canada arrive to vote Saturday at a polling station in Montreal. Polling stations in France opened this morning

Eager: A queue for the polling station in Montreal, which has the largest French population in North America, with 44,000 registered voters

Overseas effort: A French citizen living in Uruguay votes at the French consulate in Montevideo. French citizens living in the UK will have the chance to vote today in London and Edinburgh

International presence: A woman leaves a polling station in Remire-Montjoly, French Guyana

Since then, Mr Sarkozy has desperately
been trying to win over six million voters who backed far right 
National Front candidate Marine Le Pen.

At his last rally on Friday in the 
southern city of Toulon, Mr Sarkozy repeated his view that there are 
‘too many immigrants in France’ and that ‘integration was not working’.

Mr Hollande said he wanted a big win so his Left-wing programme would have a clear mandate.

Support: President Nicolas Sarkozy greets supporters as he leaves his last campaign rally in Les Sables-d'Olonne, western France, on Friday

He added: ‘If the French people must 
make a choice, they should do so clearly, overwhelmingly, so the winner 
has the capacity and means to act.’

Mr Sarkozy, who became the first 
sitting president of modern times to finish second in a presidential 
first round vote, must overcome high disapproval rates because of his 
abrasive style.

If he did win, it would be a political
sensation after a whirlwind campaign by the man many voters blame for 
stubbornly high unemployment, running at a 12-year high of nearly 10 per
cent, and France's stagnant economy.

Mr Sarkozy was due to spend today at 
home in Paris with his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni, while Mr 
Hollande visited a market in Tulle, the town in central France where he 
was mayor for seven years.

Defiant: Mr Sarkozy, speaking at the rally, has helped narrow polls with aggressive campaigning in recent days

‘I am nervous, anxious for victory,’ Mr Hollande said, as he shook hands with stall holders and kissed female well-wishers.

‘The inhabitants of Tulle won't miss me ... They will be reassured to have me as president.’

Mr Sarkozy made an impassioned final 
plea to France's 46 million voters on Friday, saying the election's 
outcome was balanced on a ‘razor's edge’.

He warned that a Socialist victory 
could send the euro zone's second largest economy spiraling into rising 
deficits and debt, like Greece.

‘On Sunday, anything is possible’ 
wrote left-leaning Liberation on its front page, noting that while 
Hollande remained the clear favorite, Mr Sarkozy was catching up fast.

The election campaign was knocked 
sideways by a shock performance by National Front candidate Marine Le 
Pen, who came third in the April 22 first round with 18 per cent of 
votes, prompting Sarkozy to shift his campaign rhetoric to the right.
