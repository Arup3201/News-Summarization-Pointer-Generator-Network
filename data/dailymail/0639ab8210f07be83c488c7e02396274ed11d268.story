A husband shot and killed his Transportation Security Administration official wife before turning the gun on himself in an apparent murder-suicide, authorities said today.

Officials said that the TSA agent, 20, was being followed by her estranged husband, 28, who tailed her into a remote parking lot for the Cleveland-Hopkins International airport.

Police said that the husband followed her into the parking lot, slammed her car with his, then fired five shots at her.

The Riveredge Parking Lot is far away from the passenger area of the busy Ohio airport, and is located off of Interstate 480.

The husband fired at a second TSA employee who had been riding with his wife but missed, police spokesman Sgt. Sammy Morris said. 

The late morning shooting at an airport employee parking lot was an apparent homicide and suicide, Morris added.

No names were immediately released.

The 20-year-old woman was rushed to MetroHealth Medical Center, where she died, according to fox8.com.

The husband was pronounced dead at the scene.

A woman who witnessed the shooting told Fox 8 that she confronted the gunman after the shooting.

‘I’m happy to be alive,’ she said, adding that she told the gunman that she called the police after witnessing him shoot his wife.

Officials said the husband and wife were estranged, but investigators weren't sure of a motive for the shooting.

The wife and the second TSA employee were commuting to work; the husband apparently followed his wife to the lot, blocked her in her car by his vehicle, and then began firing, Morris said.

The other TSA worker wasn't hurt, police said.

The wife and the other TSA employee, a man, were not romantically involved.
