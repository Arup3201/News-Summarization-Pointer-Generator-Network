President Barack Obama has been on a third as many vacations as George W. Bush had at this point in his presidency, according a statistical analysis of the two presidencies that was published today.

By CBS News Correspondent and White House historian Mark Knoller's count, President Obama has taken 20 vacations, including the one he is currently on in Martha's Vineyard, since he took office in January of 2009.

Bush had taken a whopping 58 vacations midway through his second term, Knoller told Yahoo News.

The current occupant of the White House still has his predecessor beat by a long shot in terms of the
 number of fundraisers he's attended and golf games he's played, 
however.

Bush, right, and his daughter Barbara, center, during a family vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 2007. Obama is frequently criticized for the number of vacations he's taken, but Bush went on more

Obama has hit the links 186 times since taking office, according to Knoller's records. Bush only played 24 rounds of golf throughout his entire presidency.

Then-president Bush put a halt to the hobby after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, explaining years later that he felt 'playing golf during a war just 
sends the wrong signal.'

'I don't want 
some mum whose son may have recently died to see the commander-in-chief 
playing golf. I feel I owe it to the families to be in solidarity as 
best as I can with them,' Bush said in 2008.

Meanwhile, President Obama has went golfing three times this week already while on holiday in Massachusetts even as the U.S. launched airstrikes on Islamic extremists in Iraq and contemplated a humanitarian rescue of Iraqis stranded on a mountain.

Bush attended far fewer political fundraisers that Obama while living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as well.

In announcing Obama's 400th fundraiser as president on twitter Monday, Knoller said Bush had headlined 224 cash-gathering events at the same point in time.

Bush has Obama beat in terms of the number of days he'd spent on vacation and the number of times he'd been on vacation at same point in his presidency

The frequency of Obama's golf outings and
 appearances at events to raise money for the Democratic Party has 
contributed to the perception that he has spent less time working 
than his Republican counterpart.

But Bush also spent substantially more days on vacation than Obama, Knoller notes.

As of yesterday, Obama had taken a total of 129 full or partial vacation days compared to Bush's 381.

And those are just the days and times Bush visited his Prairie Chapel ranch in Texas.Â  He also vacationed at his family's property in Kennebunkport, Maine, seven times for a total of 26 days.

Knoller said he did not count trips to presidential retreat Camp David as 
vacations. But even if he had, Bush would have Obama beat in that 
category, too.

Obama has 
only taken 33 trips to Camp David throughout his two terms and has spent
 a total of 84 days there. Bush frequented the getaway stop 108 times 
over the same length of time and stayed there for a total of 341 days.

Yahoo points out that not all of days Bush spent at his Texas ranch were true 'vacation days' as he sometimes played host to world leaders there. His getaways to Maine and numerous visits to Camp David more than offset the difference, however.

To take the title of vacationer-in-chief from Bush, Obama would need to take 879 days off before the end of his second term, the Washington Post states.
