Three quarters of GPs want to charge foreigners for appointments, figures show.

They say too many migrants and tourists are abusing the NHS, which is already under immense pressure.

Many want foreigners to be regarded as private patients and made to pay at the surgery reception either by card or cash.

A private GP appointment typically costs £70 and from then on overseas patients would also have to pay for blood tests, scans or drugs.

Ministers have warned that the NHS is becoming an ‘international health service’ and overseas patients not entitled to free care racking up bills of up to £300 million year.

They have proposed a series of measures to crackdown on the problem including a pilot scheme last month to check the documents of all new patients registering with a GP.

At present, GP appointments and treatment are free for all overseas patients although they are meant to pay for most hospital procedures.

But family doctors say that the current system makes them a gateway for foreigners abusing free hospital treatment.

Dr Kailash Chand, Deputy Chair of the British Medical Association, argues the NHS should remain free for anyone who needed to use it

This is because staff rarely bother to check patients’ nationalities and whether they should be paying as they assume that if they have a GP referral they are eligible for free NHS care.

A survey of 515 GPs by Pulse magazine  found that 77 per cent were in favour of ‘upfront’ charges for foreign patients.

One, Dr Zishan Syed, a GP in Maidstone, Kent, said: ‘It is a sad reality but there is abuse of the NHS by foreign visitors.

‘It is only fair that they pay upfront if they are not entitled to free care on the NHS.

‘The NHS is in trouble and it is only right that the Government stops anyone from taking advantage of a system that is already under immense pressure.

Another Dr Niall Finegan, a GP in Salford, Greater Manchester pointed out that British patients don’t get free care abroad there is no reason the NHS should pay for foreigners.

‘We do not get free care abroad.’ He said.

Another anonymous GP said: ‘GP should be able to charge patient as if he is private patient and give private prescription. why should we do work free of charge for patients not entitled to NHS treatment.

One other doctor, who did not reveal their name said: ‘These patients need to be treated as private patient.

‘GPs should charge fee and give private prescription. Most of money should go to GP.’

But other doctors said the NHS should remain free for anyone who needed to use it.

Dr Kailash Chand, Deputy Chair of the British Medical Association, which represents doctors said: ‘Quite a significant majority of GPs for as long as I have known have supported charging foreign visitors for NHS care.

‘They see this as one of the solutions for the demand. It is understandable.

‘But I think they are mistaken. I believe in universal health care. If they bring in these charges, where do you stop? This will be counterproductive.’

Last month the Department of Health announced a pilot whereby all new patients registering at a GP would have to prove they are either British citizens or if from the EU, show their European Health Insurance Card.

The scheme will initially involve ten practices as part of a series of measures aimed at getting GPs in the habit of checking if patients are entitled to free care.
