An American Airlines flight was cancelled Sunday afternoon when a push-back truck crashed into the nose of the plane.

Flight 140 from Baltimore to Dallas/Fort Worth was in the process of boarding around 4:10 when the crash happened.

The roof of the truck hit the fiberglass cone holding the plane's radar equipment while the cab smashed through the landing gear. The pilot immediately called the communications tower to send help.

Good job! The flight bound for Dallas was cancelled Sunday when the push-back truck crashed into the nose of the plane

Minor collision: The female driver of the truck was taken to the hospital for knee pain and released. No one else was injured in the incident

'Something didn’t work as intended and the push-back tractor struck the landing gear,' American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell told the Dallas Morning News.

Airline officials are still trying to determine whether it was a mechanical failure or the fault of the push-back truck driver.

The driver, an unnamed woman, was taken to the hospital for knee pain after the crash and released.

No other injuries were reported.

The flight was cancelled and the plane taken out of service to be inspected by engineers who will determine the extent of the damage.

Everyone on board de-planed and another aircraft was brought in to carry the 117 passengers on to Texas

Powell said events like these happen often in the airline industry.
