The five largest theater chains in North America have announced that they are pulling The Interview from their schedules after hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the Sony Pictures film.

Combined - Regal, AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex and Carmike - operate more than half of the country's 40,000 cinemas.

In a statement, Regal said it was delaying any showings of The Interview because of 'the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats.'

The five largest theater chains in North America have announced they are pulling The Interview from their schedules after hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the Sony Pictures film 

The Interview stars Seth Rogen and James Franco star as television journalists involved in a CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un 

The statement from Regal's vice president of marketing and communications also pointed the finger of blame at Sony and its 'wavering support' for the movie. 

Sony did not immediately comment on the news on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the studio told exhibitors that the company understood if they pulled the film in light of the threats.

'Due to the wavering support of the film The Interview by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats, Regal Entertainment Group has decided to delay the opening of the film in our theaters,' said Regal's Russ Nunley.

Regal Entertainment is the country's largest operator with more than 7,000 cinemas.

Cineplex also has more than a 75 percent market share in Canada with 161 theaters with 1,639 screens. 

'Cineplex takes seriously its commitment to the freedom of artistic expression, but we want to reassure our guests and staff that their safety and security is our No. 1 priority,' said a Cineplex spokesperson on Wednesday. 

Carmike Cinemas, which operates 247 theaters across the country, was the first to cancel its planned showings of the film on Tuesday. 

The fallout from the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack that began four weeks ago exploded on Tuesday after the shadowy group calling themselves Guardians of Peace escalated their attack beyond corporate espionage and threatened moviegoers with violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

Extra precaution: James Franco was spotted in NYC on Tuesday night with his new giant bodyguard after GOP issued a chilling new threat warning of 9/11-style attacks on movie theaters that show The Interview

The Department of Homeland Security has said there was 'no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,' but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group, dubbed GOP. 

The theaters won’t play the film until the conclusion of an FBI investigation into the three-week-old cyberattack on Sony Pictures and subsequent terrorist threats, reports The Wall Street Journal.

The warning did prompt law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles to address measures to ramp up security and Thursday's New York premiere at the Landmark Sunshine was canceled as a result.

Sony still plans to make the film available to theaters on Christmas Day should they choose to exhibit it, although the company is now understood to be considering releasing the film on premium video-on-demand instead, reports Variety.

The move would allow the studio to recoup some of the film’s $42 million budget and maximize the promotional exposure the film has received due to the threats. It would also enable the studio to experiment with the potential of VOD.

In The Interview, Rogen and Franco star as television journalists involved in a CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 

Speculation about a North Korean link to the Sony hacking has centered on that country's angry denunciation of the film.

Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate.' It said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation.

The film was slated to hit theaters nationwide on Christmas Day. It premiered in Los Angeles last week.

But on Tuesday, Rogen and Franco pulled out of all media appearances, canceling a Buzzfeed Q&A and Rogen's planned guest spot Thursday on Late Night With Seth Meyers. 

The FBI said it is aware of the GOP's threats and 'continues to work collaboratively with our partners to investigate this matter.' FBI director James Comey last week said that investigators are still trying to determine who is responsible for the hack.

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said his department takes the hackers' threats 'very seriously' and will be taking extra precautions during the holidays at theaters.

Hollywood studio Sony Pictures said on Tuesday that it was not pulling the film, but is leaving it to theater chains to decide whether to show the movie, which depicts a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un.

'We plan to release the film,' said a source at Sony, which is dealing with fallout from an enormous cyber-attack last month.

The source added that a decision whether to show the film 'is with theater owners, partners whom we support.'

GOP also released a trove of data files including 32,000 emails to and from Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton in what it called the beginning of a 'Christmas gift.'

And two former Sony film production workers filed lawsuits alleging the Culver City, California company waited too long to notify nearly 50,000 employees that data such as Social Security numbers, salaries and medical records had been stolen.

The filing follows another lawsuit this week from two other former Sony employees accusing the studio of being negligent by not bolstering its defenses against hackers before the attack. 

The Guardians of Peace threat released on Tuesday reads:

Warning

We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places The Interview be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.

Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.

The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001.

We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you’d better leave.)

Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.

All the world will denounce the SONY. 

It claims emails and other leaked information show that Sony's information-technology department and its top lawyer believed its security system was vulnerable to attack, but that company did not act on those warnings. 

Sony potentially faces tens of millions of dollars in damages from a class-action lawsuit, said Jonathan Handel, an entertainment law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law.

Since the hack surfaced late last month, everything from financial figures to salacious emails between top Sony executives has been dumped online.

The nearly 32,000 emails to and from Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Lynton leaked on Tuesday include information about casting decisions and total costs for upcoming films, release schedules for Sony films through 2018 and corporate financial records, such as royalties from iTunes, Spotify and Pandora music services. 

They include information about new electronics devices such as DVD players and cellphones. They also include budget figures for the Motion Picture Association of America, of which Sony is a member, and at least one email about a senior Sony executive who left the company. 

Hackers invoked the 9/11 attacks in their most chilling threat yet against Sony Pictures, warning the Hollywood studio not to release a film which has angered North Korea

The emails also include banal messages about public appearances, tennis matches, home repairs, dinner invitations and business introductions. 

On Monday, Sony Pictures boss Michael Lynton sought to reassure employees that the studio would not be destroyed by the leaks.

'This will not take us down,' Lynton told employees, adding: 'You should not be worried about the future of this studio.'

North Korea has denied involvement in the brazen November 24 cyber-attack, which some expert said could possibly have been carried out by disgruntled workers or by supporters of North Korea furious over the movie.
