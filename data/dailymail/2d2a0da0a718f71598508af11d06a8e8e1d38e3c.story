When it comes to celebrating Valentine’s Day, nothing beats a romantic night in with your loved one - but let’s face it, who wants to slave over the stove at the weekend?

And if you're not as handy in the kitchen as you are in the bedroom, then these supermarket ready-meals could mean the difference between an after-dinner break up row or a making out session. 

The value-for-money options all offer three-course menus for £20 and under and include a bottle of wine so there's cash to spare if you're looking to splash out on a present as well.  

Kitchen distractions: There's no point slaving over the stove this Valentine's weekend when the supermarkets have done your job for you

Sainsbury’s £15 ‘romantic night in for two with a meal’ deal includes a main dish, two sides, a bottle of wine or soft drink, dessert, plus online film rental from the supermarket’s Entertainment on demand channel 

Tesco’s Valentine’s choices are any two main courses, two side dishes and two desserts from their finest* menu. That’s six dishes for £20, a saving up between £10.99 and £18.49 off the items if bought separately.Choose lamb shanks with roasted vegetables or crispy pork belly with caramelised apple in a sweet jus with a side dish of triple cooked chips with a potato and parsnip dauphinoise. For dessert you could have a raspberry heart or a Belgian chocolate heart.

Choices for the main course include sea bass fillets with ginger and lime butter, rump steak or Just Cook Chicken with Black Pepper, Rosemary & Smoked Salt Sprinkle.

Sides are potato Dauphinoise, Rustic Chips, Green Vegetable Selection or Chantenay Carrot and Tenderstem Brocolli.

End your meal with a bottle of Mondelli Rose or Old Vine Garnacha and Choc & Amaretto Chcake Slices or a Rasberry Panna Cotta.

And Marks & Spencer have also jumped on the meal deal bandwagon and is offering those of an amorous persuasion but lacking in kitchen skills a chance to redeem themselves with their £20 bargain.

Their menu includes Thai-style fish cakes and Coquilles St Jacques to start, beef Wellington or herb-crusted rack of lamb as a main and green vegetables, chunky chips or roast vegetables as a side.

Dessert is a choice of profiteroles, Marc De Champagne mousse or Valentine’s hearts.

And if you don’t fancy anything on their meal deal menu, you could choose to serve your love a luxury dinner from the Gastropub selection.

Go for slow cooked pork and kentish cider en croute (£6.49), beer glazed sticky chicken thighs with wedges and kimchee ketchup (£6.99) or slow cooked venison with ragu potato and cauliflower gratin (£8.49).

Posh supermarket Waitrose's  Valentine’s Day £20 meal deal will get you starter, main, side, dessert, wine and chocolates.

But if you really want something special then opt for the posh supermarket's Heston Blumenthal ready meals, from the  £7.99 fish pie to the most expensive £9.99 confit duck.
