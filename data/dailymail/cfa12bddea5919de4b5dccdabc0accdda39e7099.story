The look on U.S. figure skater Ashley Wagner's said it all Saturday after judges in Sochi scored her a 63.10 in her Olympic debut.

The look of disgust was in stark contrast to the radiant smile she displayed just moments earlier after completing her routine.

Wagner, 22, clearly believed she'd pulled off a performance worthy of a high score as she waved, smiled and blew kisses to the audience.

But her smile turned upside down when the score came in, which left her in fourth place.

'I know roughly when I skate a good program where the score should end up... So yeah to score that low was very disappointing for me,' she said afterwards.

'But honestly this performance was more for myself and mentally getting beyond this past couple of weeks. And I wanted to do everything I could to help out the team, and I really feel that I delivered on that part.'

Wagner may feel that she's got something to prove after her selection over Mirai Nagasu sparked a backlash on social media.

Nagasu finished third at the National Championships in Boston last month while Wagner finished in fourth place, yet it was she who was selected to the Winter Olympic team.

'It was on my mind with the media 
frenzy over the last couple of weeks that I needed to prove to myself 
and everybody else that has even doubted my belonging here that I am 
here to compete, to be competitive,' she told Yahoo.

The numbers she scored, though, left her visibly disappointed.

She
 was left trailing Russia's Yulia Lipnitskaya in first place, Carolina 
Kostner of Italy in second and Mao Asada of Japan, who came third 
despite falling during her routine.

Her score, however, was enough to advance the U.S. team from seventh to third place, meaning they will be one of the top five teams to advance through to the finals on Sunday night.

Her facial expression upon seeing her score is reminiscent of the distinctly unimpressed look gymnast McKayla Maroney wore on the second-place podium during the 2012 Olympics.

Maroney's visage was captured the public imagination - in other words, it became a meme.

Time will tell if one unguarded facial expression will come to define Wagner in history more than her figure skating ability.
