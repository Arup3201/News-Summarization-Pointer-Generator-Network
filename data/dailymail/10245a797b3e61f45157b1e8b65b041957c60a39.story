Officials are worried that secondary school children are unable to resist the temptation to snack on junk food

Fast food takeaways should be banned from near schools in a bid to curb child obesity, the government’s public health quango has urged.

Public Health England has brought out tough new guidance for councils, urging planners to refuse permission for burger bars, chip shops and pizza parlours within five minutes’ walking distance of schools.

Officials are worried that secondary school children, many of whom are allowed to leave school premises at lunch time, are unable to resist the temptation to snack on junk food if it is available nearby.

The dramatic guidance is designed to turn around the worrying levels of obesity in our society. Two-thirds of English adults, one-fifth of children in reception and a third of those in the final year of primary school are obese or overweight.

Last week Jamie Oliver demanded a clampdown on takeaway shops that tempt pupils away at lunchtime.

The TV chef called for urgent action over the ‘madness’ which allows junk food operators to still open up ‘within spitting distance’ of some schools.

In an interview with the Times Educational Supplement, Mr Oliver said: ‘You can’t have one arm of the government investing money in food education and school lunches, and then have another part allowing junk food, en masse, to be licensed and given permission to trade within a stone’s throw of a school on every corner.’

Research commissioned by PHE reveals that takeaways are a much bigger problem in some authorities than others, with a massive disparity across the country in the density of outlets per head of population.

Those with the highest number tend to be in the most deprived areas of the country, with the density varying from 15 takeaways per 100,000 people in the richest areas to 172 in the poorest.

In turn, poorer people tend to be more unhealthy. Levels of obesity among the 10 per cent most deprived children in the last year of primary school are double rates among the 10 per cent least deprived.

The PHE report, distributed to all councils, calls on them to use the planning process to ‘modify the environment’ in order to prevent easy access to ‘energy-dense food’.

One of the dietary trends in recent years has been an increase in the proportion of food eaten outside the home, which is more likely to be high in calories, said a report by Public Health England

It said: ‘One of the dietary trends in 
recent years has been an increase in the proportion of food eaten 
outside the home, which is more likely to be high in calories.

‘Of particular concern are hot food takeaways, which tend to sell food that is high in fat and salt, and low in fibre, fruit and vegetables.’

The report added: ‘One important action is to modify the environment so that it does not promote sedentary behaviour or provide easy access to energy-dense food.

‘The aim is to help make the healthy choice the easy choice via environmental change and action at population and individual levels.

‘Local authorities have a range of legislative and policy levers at their disposal, alongside wider influences on healthy lifestyles, that can help to create places where people are supported to maintain a healthy weight.

‘Public health professionals should work with their colleagues across local authorities to use these and other approaches to maximise health benefits.

‘Planning authorities can influence the built environment and reduce the extent to which it promotes obesity.’

Although the PHE admits there is little 
research linking elevated levels of obesity with high concentrations of 
fast food outlets, it says there is a ‘theoretical’ argument that there 
is likely to be a link.

It says a priority for councils should be to protect children from the temptation of spending their money in takeaways at lunchtimes or on the way home.

The 38-year-old TV chef challenged political parties to make the issue part of their election campaigns

‘Improving the quality of the food environment around schools has the potential to influence children’s food-purchasing habits, potentially influencing their future diets,’ the report said.

‘However, it is important to note that taking action on hot food takeaways is only part of the solution, as it does not address sweets and other high-calorie food that children can buy in shops near schools.’

The report points out that a number of London boroughs have already brought in bans on takeaways near schools.

Most use a 400 metre exclusion zone, which is equivalent to five minutes’ walk; but Brighton and Hove uses a larger zone of 800 metres.

To ensure such zones avoiding the danger of losing appeals, PHE suggests some ways they can strengthen their case.

‘Many hot food takeaways may generate substantial litter in an area well beyond their immediate vicinity,’ he said. ‘Discarded food waste and litter attracts foraging animals and pest species.

‘Hot food takeaways may reduce the visual appeal of the local environment and generate night-time noise. Short-term car parking outside takeaways may contribute to traffic congestion.

‘Improving access to healthier food in deprived communities may contribute to reducing health inequalities.’

PHE also suggests councils could use street trading legislation to restrict fast food vans from setting up shops near schools. Hillingdon Council in London, for example, has banned ice cream vans near schools and nurseries.

The report also called for councillors to be appointed as healthy eating czars to liaise between planners and the NHS.
