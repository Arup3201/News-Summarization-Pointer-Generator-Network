The man who was stabbed to death in a public housing block in Sydney last weekend did not deserve to become a footnote in a celebrity story, a former friend says.

Daniel McNulty, 48, died after he was allegedly stabbed multiple times over a $70 drug deal inside his ground-floor apartment at Redfern, just outside of Sydney's CBD, on Sunday.

The drug-user and suspected part-time drug dealer had been living in the rundown area for the past two years as he tried to battle his heroin addiction.

Daniel McNulty, 48, died after he was allegedly stabbed multiple times over a $70 drug deal inside his ground-floor apartment at Redfern, just outside of Sydney's CBD, on Sunday

Police will allege Mr McNulty was stabbed twice on Sunday night, once in the left knee and again fatally in his back

One of three people arrested this week over Mr McNulty's alleged murder was former NSW Premier Neville Wran's daughter, Harriet Wran.

The heiress' addiction to ice and subsequent fall from grace has been well documented, prompting those who knew Mr McNulty to speak out to remember him.

'He did not deserve this. He was a person who had feelings. He had a daughter,' one friend, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'Daniel was a street kid who never had any tools to live life. He just could never get it right. He was clean for quite a number of years but, you know, it's an insidious disease that he had.'

Prior to his ill-fated death, Mr McNulty was a well respected sound engineer working in Sydney's film and music industry.

He had worked on a Tropfest-nominated film in 1998 and had music projects and SBS documentaries to add to his resume.

Mr McNulty studied at the Australian Film Television and Radio School in Sydney, friends told the Daily Telegraph.

'We all had good, budding careers back in the early 90s and it was a fun industry, we were a family,' film producer Gavin Barbey said.

'There are a lot of people who fall off the wagon but Dan was a nice guy. He was well-respected.'

The 48-year-old dabbled with drug use as a young man, but had been clean for about 20 years while he worked on his film career.

He moved to Bryon Bay for 10 years to work as a fisherman, before returning to Sydney a few years ago to try and curb his heroin addiction.

Jim Hearne, a friend of Mr McNulty's for 20 years, said he was shocked to hear of his violent death.

'I bumped into him a few months ago at a festival on Oxford Street and he didn't look good to be frank,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

Three people stand accused of Mr McNulty's murder - Harriet Wran, 26, Lloyd Haines, 29, and Michael Lee, 35

A second man, Brett Fitzgerald, 42, was stabbed several times in the attack and remains in a stable condition at St Vincent's Hospital

'But he was as charming as ever.'

Mr McNulty was due in court later this year to face charges of possession of stolen goods and larceny.

'He was a cheeky bugger but he didn't have a history of violence,' Mr Hearne said.

The keen fisherman had a nine-year-old daughter but had separated from his partner before he died.
