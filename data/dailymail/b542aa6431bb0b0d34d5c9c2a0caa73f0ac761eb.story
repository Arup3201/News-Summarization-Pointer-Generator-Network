Police arrived to find the three bodies and quickly announced on Twitter the shooter had been 'contained'. 

Investigators recovered three handguns from the scene and had 'several pockets full of ammunition'.

The male victim has not been identified, pending notification of next of kin.

Ida Garcia was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but police say she is recovering, police said at a press conference Saturday. 

About 100 people were in the mall at the time. 

The mall officially opens officially at 10 am but the shooting reportedly happened about 9.30 am in the food court area.

The doors open early for employees and for people to walk around before the shops open.

'We were putting our merchandise out in Kay Jewelers and all the sudden we heard these really loud bangs,' mall employee Cody Jones told WFTV.

'Like eight of them. 

'It was definitely gunshots. 

'People were running through the mall and stuff and trying to see what’s going on

'I saw two people shot when I walked outside the entrance.'

No other information about the victims have been released.

Workers inside the center said gunshots were fired in quick succession, according to NBC.

The bomb squad was called to inspect a car in the car park. 

Closed: Melbourne quickly shut down the mall, but say it will be open for business on Sunday

Store employees were instructed to exit the mall through their rear entrances. 

Witnesses were terrified.

'You don't keep your cool,' witness Elizabeth Tickle told WFTV. 

'You're just automatically reacting. 

'Your feet are just going and your legs are running,' 

After the bomb squad inspected Rodriguez's car, WFTV reported they went to Rodriguez's home in Palm Bay. 

Investigation: Police also inspected the couple's Palm Bay home following the shooting

Family: The couple had been married for 16 years according to Facebook and believed to have two daughters

Scene: A major police presence can be seen at the Melbourne Square mall in Melbourne, Florida , Saturday

Elizabeth Trickle and Donna Evans told Florida Today they were 20 to 25 feet from Rodriguez when he opened fire. 

'I was running one way and (Evans) was running another way and then she came back and she got me and we ran through the exit at Dillard's,' Trickle said.

'It was a frightening experience, something that you don't ever want anybody to experience. 

'It was crazy. We had just gotten our food to sit down by Starbucks and Chik-fil-A, and you just hear the 'pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,' and you just drop everything and your body just makes you run,' Evans added.

'Very, very lucky. 'Cause If it would have been the other way, it would've been us because we were right in the line of it, so yes, God is on my shoulder whether people believe in it or not.'

Happier times: Jose Garcia Rodriguez, 57, of Palm Bay, was one of the dead. His wife Ida has survived

On his Facebook page, Rodriguez says he has been married to his wife for 16 years and that their anniversary is in March 1998.

The two appear to have two teenage daughters together.

Ida Garcia says on her Facebook page that she runs an ice cream business.
