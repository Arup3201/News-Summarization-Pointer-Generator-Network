New Year is usually the time to make changes in your life but Queen Letizia has started early, debuting a chic new hairstyle during a charity event at the Palacio Real today.

The Spanish queen, 42, showed off noticeably shorter, darker locks at the event which was held in honour of the Principe de Girona Foundation.

With her was husband King Felipe, 46, who certainly seemed to approve of the new 'do and beamed broadly as he strode into the room.

Royal duties: King Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia met with Principe de Girona Foundation members

The foundation is the Spanish equivalent of The Prince's Trust and works with young people, helping them boost their chances of success in their careers.

The foundation is named for a title once held by Felipe, the Prince of Girona, which is traditionally conferred upon Spanish royal heirs. 

One of the oldest given to members of the royal family, the style was introduced in 1351 by Peter IV of Aragon.

Although the Kingdom of Aragon has not existed as a separate entity since 1707, the title is still given to Spanish heirs and is now held by Felipe's daughter, Infanta Leonor.

Busy: Despite being so close to Christmas, Felipe and Letizia are still hard at work

Like King Felipe, Leonor's mother Queen Letizia was on good form for the event and showcased her trademark polished style, courtesy of a chic grey and black dress with a belted black coat.

Felipe, meanwhile, was still sporting a rugged beard, but looked dapper in his grey pinstripe suit which he enlivened with the addition of a bright blue patterned tie.

Despite the proximity to Christmas, the Spanish royals remain busy and just yesterday, unveiled the design for their first Christmas card since  taking the Spanish throne in June this year.

The cover of the magenta  card features a snap of the royal couple standing on the balcony of the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid with a crowd of well-wishers below.

Inside, there is a family photo, with the couple joined by their two daughters, eight-year-old Infanta Leonor and seven-year-old Infanta Sofia.

There is also a message written in both Spanish and English, which reads: 'Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2015.

'We hope that the excitement, the hope, and the goodwill of Christmas remain beyond these days of celebration.'

Princess Leonor, who will one day be Queen of Spain,  signed the card with her official  title, Princesa de Asturias - the designation once held by her father.
