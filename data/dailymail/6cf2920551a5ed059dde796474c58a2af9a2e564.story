A Hobart beach was awash with naked bodies on Sunday as more than 500 brave souls went skinny dipping together to mark the winter solstice.

People of all ages and sizes took to the chilly waters at the mouth of the River Derwent at Long Beach, south east of Hobart, for a midwinter sunrise dip wearing nothing but matching red swimming caps.

The swimmers braved the frosty six degree temperatures as they took the plunge at exactly 7.42am for the winter solstice celebrations as part of the annual Dark MOFO arts festival.

'You get your gear off and you're all the same,' swimmer David Day said.

'You're just people, you're beings and all just sharing it together.'

Plenty of screams were heard but surf life savers reported no problems as the swimmers made for a row of buoys around 50m off the beach.

It is the second time the nude swim has been run and Hobart Lord Mayor Damon Davies, who took part last year, is bracing for the island capital to become a nude swim destination.

'I think it could become one of the special events of the year and this whole beach will be taken over,' he said.

The swim took place on the final day of the Dark MOFO, the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA)'s winter festival, which saw tourists and locals flock to concerts, exhibitions and a waterfront feast.
