All you need is Low, apparently. And who can argue? Germany fans lined the streets of a sun-kissed Berlin in their tens of thousands to welcome home the World Cup champions ahead of the largest gathering the city has seen since 1990. Perhaps even a year previous when the wall came down.

There they waited at the tip of Brandenburg Gate – the scene of seven parties over the past month to celebrate the hexagon of wins, and that draw against Ghana, over in Brazil – for one final send off. Some of the estimated half-a-million climbed traffic lights - one sat on the top of a Bratwurst truck. Anywhere would do.

The take on the Beatles’ All You Need is Love was emblazoned on a homemade banner, supplemented with ‘we take a bow’. It captured the feelings of a united nation. This achievement – decimating all in sight – cannot be overestimated and is down in no small part to the meticulous planning and continued progression of their head coach, Joachim, over the last eight years.

Is it a bird? Jubilant Germans clap and reach to the sky as the plane carrying the winning squad flies over the fan park before touching down

Despite all that, it's unlike him to take any over-zealous adulation, with the 54-year-old destined to leave that to his players.

The victorious 23-man squad were due to reach the fan park at 10am as pictures of them touching down at the city’s airport at exactly 9.08am were met with a chorus of cheers at the heart of the capital.

The hordes had to entertain themselves for a little while longer after the side's flight from Rio di Janeiro was delayed by an hour after a luggage truck collided with the side of the aircraft - a fitting end to a chaotic tournament tenure for the Brazilian transport system.

Not that it bothered the players, although whether they would've enjoyed the crowd's harmony of DJ Otzi's Hey Baby is highly questionable.

They took the last part of the trip to the Brandenburg Gate, just over six miles on an open truck. Not bus, truck. The 'fan mile' had started filling up hours before the arrival, with some waiting overnight to get a place at the front.

'We're all excited to see what it will be like,' Bastian Schweinsteiger told ARD television. 'This time, thank God, we have the cup with us.'

'It will only sink in for us in the next few days.'

Photographers
 jostled for position just yards from the plane to capture skipper 
Philipp Lahm - trophy in hand and aloft - stride down the steps 
decorated with 'World Cup winners 2014' accompanied with four stars.

Yes,
 this is a side to have won three previous tournaments, but this has 
taken on special meaning given the previous dominance of Spain, a 
24-year wait and heartbreak in each of the last three.

Flags waved, children sat on their parents' shoulders and people bobbed up and down in excitement. A player was yet to turn up; this is a party that has gone on since the 113th minute of Sunday night when pocked-sized Mario Gotze took two touches of sheer brilliance and won't finish for a good while yet.

Pleased: Lukas Podolski (left to right), Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil,  Ron-Robert Zieler, Jerome Boateng and Sami Khedira on stage

Vantage point: One fan, German flag in one hand and phone the other, sits himself on top of a Bratwurst truck to watch the action

Final destination: They waited patiently in party mood for the victors to arrive at the iconic Brandenburg Gate later in the morning

The messiah: A battered and bruised Schweinsteiger gees the crowds up even further draped in a Germany flag on the edge of the platform

The truck slalomed through the packed streets of the city as Gotze tweeted 'Wow, what's going on here ... AMAZING!' and Lukas Podolski posed for his now customary photos. For the record, Schweinsteiger and Kevin Grosskreutz were the unfortunate men involved this time. 

The Arsenal man finds himself on the end of a bit of stick for his social media prowess, but there is little doubt the forward who has 116 caps, 47 goals and has played for a decade for a decade is a key cog in this dressing room. 'The most amazing moment of my career. A super 6 weeks,' he enthused.

His tweeting and thirst for pictures is clearly contagious.

Team-mate Mesut Ozil followed suit as he gave his 7.4million Twitter followers an on-truck glimpse as to what the morning felt like, posting pictures captioned 'back in the country of the world champions'.

And they kept the tens of thousands on tenterhooks upon arriving at the gate, with several players peeking out its interior to have a look at the masses below. It felt like the unveiling of a royal baby at Buckingham Palace.

That was until Ein hoch auf uns by Andreas Bourani began to boom out along the mile. You wouldn't get that down Green Park. The chorus to that particular number is 'Here's to us, to this life, and this immortal moment'. A fitting tribute.

When they finally made it on stage they were led by the bashful Low, who said: 'It was a long way to the title, and a tough one too, but we're delighted to be here with our fans. First, we wouldn't have got here without you. We are all world champions.'

Raise your hands: Manuel Neuer (left) and Low enjoy the rapturous applause as they are cheered along the route

Delight: Ozil, Andre Schurrle and Mario Gotze celebrate on the top of the party truck

Per Mertesacker added: 'We're super proud of what we've achieved, especially after all we've gone through. And we're proud of these fans,' before Jerome Boateng whipped up the crowd. 'I can't hear you Berlin,' he queried. They duly obliged.

That went up a notch once Toni Kroos took to the stage moments later, too.

'Miro Klose, Miro Klose, Miro Klose, you are the top man,' he improvised in song. Berlin erupted, as it's likely to do throughout the day. And the next. Probably the one after as well. Germany are world champions, and they know it.
