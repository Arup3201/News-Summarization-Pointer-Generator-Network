A grandfather who was so scared of being burgled that he slept downstairs in his armchair was throttled to death by a serial thief who had been released early.

Paul Cox had taken to spending nights in his living room two years earlier after becoming the victim of burglaries only months apart.

But his fear of being targeted again became a reality when he was killed by drunken intruder Cory Youlden, who escaped with a bag of coins and Mr Cox’s car.

The disabled grandfather’s body was 
found hours later, slumped at the foot of his chair in the home he had 
lived in for 55 years. Mr Cox died just four days before his 84th 
birthday.

Yesterday, Youlden, who had 24 other convictions, was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 22 years for the savage crime.

He carried out the attack three months
after being released on licence, half-way through a 42-month sentence 
for three street robberies.

After strangling Mr Cox in a headlock, he tried to erase forensic evidence by cleaning up with bleach, the court heard.

He then left the house at Rednal, 
Worcestershire, in his victim’s Ford Focus, having taken the keys along 
with the cash from Mr Cox’s pocket.

Prosecutor Alex Warren said Youlden, 
23, smashed a bay window to break in to the semi-detached home in the 
early hours, after storming out of his girlfriend’s home during a row. 
The barrister added: ‘Mr Cox had been burgled on two previous occasions 
in 2009.

‘He had started sleeping downstairs in a chair with a hammer because he was afraid of further burglaries.’

Mr Warren said that after a 
confrontation in the rear sitting room – where Mr Cox was sleeping with 
an electric fire on for warmth – Youlden left his victim ‘dead or 
dying’.

He said footprints matching Youlden’s 
shoes were discovered upstairs while the defendant’s fingerprints were 
found on the smashed window pane.

Scene: Mr Cox was found dead in the living room of his home in Rednal, Worcestershire, in June last year

Police were called after a neighbour noticed Mr Cox’s car was missing.

Mr Cox, who had separated from his 
wife 40 years ago, suffered from coronary heart disease, was blind in 
one eye and partially deaf, the court heard.

He had carried out his national 
service in the Royal Engineers, stationed in Palestine and Egypt, and 
spent much of his working life as an engineer and toolmaker for 
Cadbury’s.

A post-mortem examination found the pensioner died of pressure to the neck.

Youlden was arrested two days after the killing in June. By then he had sold Mr Cox’s car for £400. It was found burned out.

Stephen Lineham QC, defending, told 
Worcester Crown Court Youlden had had a ‘wretched life’, having been 
fostered at 11 months and later adopted.

Youlden, whose address was given as a hostel in Birmingham, admitted murder, theft and burglary earlier this month.

The court heard the father of one, who
was first convicted at 14, had a string of burglaries and robberies to 
his name. Judge Robert Juckes QC said Mr Cox had offered Youlden ‘little
by way of resistance’ but was nevertheless held in a headlock for 
between 15 and 20 seconds.

He told the defendant: ‘You not only killed him but you left him on the ground after taking from him money and keys.

‘You are a young man with an appalling record of burglary.’

Mr Cox is survived by his son Greg, 58, daughter Jane, 54, a brother and two grandchildren.

In a statement, the family said it is 
they ‘who feel they have the life sentence’, adding Mr Cox had been 
living independently, ‘still able to enjoy life, have a pint, watch 
sport and spend time with his family’.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Williamson, of West Mercia Police, said Youlden was ‘deceitful, callous and calculated’.

The ‘tragic and brutal killing of a vulnerable man’ was ‘all the more senseless because Youlden gained very little, he added.
