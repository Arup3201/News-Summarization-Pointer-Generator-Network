Scottish MPs would be barred from voting on English issues under plans being drawn up by senior Tories.

David Cameron has joined Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg in offering new powers over tax, welfare and spending if Scotland votes No to independence next week.

But senior Tories say the ‘devo-max’ option would be ‘untenable’ unless it is accompanied by greater devolution for England.

Former Tory Cabinet Minister John Redwood is among Tories calling for changes to be made which would exclude Scottish MPs from voting on exclusively English issues if devo-max is implemented 

They are now pushing to revive plans devised for David Cameron before the last election by Tory grandee Kenneth Clarke, which would bar Scottish MPs from voting at Westminster on purely English issues.

At the time, his plans would have prevented Scottish MPs from voting on health, education and local government. 

He added when Scotland wins the right to make more decisions following Alex Salmond's referendum, England will expect the same privileges 

Under devo-max, they could also be barred from voting on critical issues such as the Budget and welfare reform. 

Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood, who is leading the campaign for reform, said an ‘overwhelming majority’ of Tory MPs believe the ‘lopsided’ arrangements must change.

He said: ‘Scotland got first-class devolution, Wales got second-class, England got none at all.

'It meant English students going to Scottish universities have had to pay whilst Scottish students have gone free.

‘Once Scotland gets the right to make more decisions, England will expect the same powers.

Everything that falls to be decided in Scotland by the Scottish Parliament would be decided by the English Parliament in England.’

Fellow Tory Andrew Percy said further devolution to Scotland would be ‘intolerable’ unless it were accompanied by a fairer deal for England.

Mr Percy, MP for Brigg and Goole, added: ‘It’s a particular problem in the north of England if Scotland gets more tax powers.’

Downing Street yesterday would not comment on whether the rights of Scottish MPs could be restricted. 

Ministers are thought to be reluctant to raise the prospect ahead of the vote. But a Whitehall source said some change was ‘inevitable’.
