Accused: Coronation Street bad-boy Andrew Lancel has been charged with five counts of sexually abusing a child, it has emerged. He is pictured with his wife Louise

Coronation Street bad-boy Andrew Lancel has been charged with five counts of sexually abusing a child, it has emerged.

The 42-year-old actor - who played Frank Foster in the popular soap - has been accused of indecent assault on a victim under the age of 16.

The alleged offences are believed to date back to when he was a trainee actor called Andrew Watkinson.

Speaking to The Sun, his lawyer said Mr Lancel 'strenuously denies the allegations'.

Solicitor Stuart Nolan said: 'Mr Lancel was invited by police to co-operate with an inquiry by one complainant about events that allegedly took place over 20 years ago.

'He is confident his innocence will be established in the fullness of time.'

It is believed that after leaving a police station in the Liverpool area yesterday, he returned to the luxury Â£400,000 home which he shares with his wife Louise.

The actor is currently starring in the play Epstein: The Man Who Made The Beatles in Liverpool. Last night he tweeted:

'My lovely followers and friends. Your support means the world. Have faith. Good night. See you soon x.'

Lancel's Coronation Street character Frank was killed off in March. He joined the famous soap after being in The Bill as Detective Inspector Neil Manson.

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Merseyside Police can confirm that a 42-year-old man has been charged with five offences of indecent assault on a child under 16 under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

'Andrew Watkinson, 42, was charged with the offences today (Friday, 30 November).

'The offences are historic. He has been bailed to appear at South Sefton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, 19 December.'
