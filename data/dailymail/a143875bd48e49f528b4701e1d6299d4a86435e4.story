A clueless criminal who spent 15 years behind bars for robbing a children's shoe shore has admitted targeting the outlet again a day after his release... and the same shop assistant was behind the counter.

In 1999, Christopher Miller - then 25 - was arrested after he forced employees into the back room of the Stride Rite shoe store in New Jersey in the U.S., tied them up and fled with cash.

After serving a 15-year sentence, Miller was released  from South Woods State Prison in March last year.

Police said Miller, then 40, entered the store at about 4.20pm the following day and demanded cash, telling the workers - a 17-year-old boy and 43-year-old woman - to go to the back room. 

He was not believed to be armed and the workers refused to follow his orders. 

He became agitated, according to police, and took the cash register drawer, which contained $389 (£260). He then took the workers' mobile phones and the store phone, and fled on foot.

Police said they found Miller a few blocks away, with the cash stashed in a gutter and the phones in a garbage can.

The clerk had been notified about Miller's release and identified the suspect as the same person who had robbed the store in 1999. 

At the time, Toms River Police Chief Mitchell Little said he wondered whether Miller considers prison his home.

'Maybe that's the only life he knows, and the only thing he could think of was going back to the same store and doing the same crime again - getting caught and going back where he was taken care of and told what to do and getting meals and shelter and everything else,' he said.

Miller was charged with robbery - again - and was held on $100,000 (£668,000) bail.

On Monday, he pleaded guilty to second-degree robbery. He faces a prison term of between 10 and 20 years when he is sentenced in May.

In 1999, Miller was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a total of three armed robberies in New Jersey, as well as theft, criminal restraint and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.
