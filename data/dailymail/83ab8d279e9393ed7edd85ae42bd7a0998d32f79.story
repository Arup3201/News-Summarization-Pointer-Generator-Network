Filthy houses and flabby thighs are the things we'd most like to banish in 2013, according to new research.

But although cleaning up and exercising more have been named Britain's top New Year's resolutions, most of us will give up both of them by February, as the average person sticks to their new life goals for a measly five weeks.

Other top aspirations for this year include spending less money (26 per cent of respondents), dieting (21 per cent) and finding a new job (16 per cent).

Some 29 per cent of British people plan to keep their houses spotless in 2013, the same amount who have made exercising more their New Year's resolution

Research by Vileda revealed that 
29 per cent of Brits plan to keep their house looking spotless next year - the same number that plan on exercising more.

The top dreams for our personal lives include financial stability (46 per cent), losing weight (37 per cent) and going on an exotic holiday (22 per cent).

Men appear to be more career focused than women, with 16 per cent dreaming of landing a new job and 14 per cent wishing for a pay rise.

But despite 60 per cent of us making at least three resolutions each year, 49 per cent of Brits fail to stick to them for more than a month.

Can you stick to your New Year's resolutions beyond February, or will you - like most of us - have fallen off the wagon by then?

The older we get, the better we are at seeing our dreams through to fruition with 36 per cent of 45-54 years olds keep at least 2 dreams for at least 6 months.

Londoners are most likely to make a list of their dreams, with 46 per cent of the capitals inhabitants setting themselves goals for 2013, the Welsh are least likely to make any with just 31 per cent pinpointing their aims for the coming year

Brits also have big dreams for their homes in 2013, with 45 per cent of the country claiming that they have plans to make improvements in at least one room of their home.

The most popular rooms that will be getting a makeover next year are bathrooms (38 per cent), living rooms (33 per cent) and kitchens (32 per cent).

Around 16 per cent of people say their top goal for 2013 is to find a new job, and 14 per cent of men would like a pay rise before the year is out

However financial concerns may scarper our plans for home improvement, with over half of respondents saying money would prevent them from following through with a re-vamp.

When it comes to cleaning, the average Brit thinks they will probably only last six weeks at their new resolution.

Some 6 per cent even said they'll probably give up their ambition in less than seven days, while an ambitious 12 per cent aim for more than four months.

Although 46 per cent of people are dreaming of financial stability in 2013, researchers say the best way of sticking to your resolutions is to be realistic with your targets and not plan a 'complete overhaul' immediately

Lindsey Taylor of Vileda said: 
‘Exercising, dieting and giving up things such as smoking or drinking 
are all traditional resolutions for the New Year.

'However, cleaning up the home is now
top of our agenda as well as cleaning up our lifestyles. Many of us 
want a completely fresh and clutter-free start to the year and as they 
say, a tidy house equals a tidy mind.’

Advising people on how to stick to their resolutions, she added: 'We all know it can be difficult to keep New Year's resolutions especially if we set ourselves challenging targets such as losing a lot of weight in the first month, or keeping a completely spotless home.Be realistic with your targets and don't plan a complete overhaul immediately.‘

If so, you're a better person than most.

Over two thirds of dieters will ditch their weight loss regime by the 15th of this month, according to a new poll. And weak-willed seven per cent of slimmers will give up by the end of day one.

The optimum time for ditching the diet is around 11am on January 15th
with dieters claiming after two weeks and one day without any treats, 
they often succumb during the morning coffee break.

Most people who decide to lose weight this year will have thrown in the towel by mid-January

Out of those who manage to hang on past then, a further 15 per cent said they keep up the healthy 
eating until the end of January, and 23 per cent claim they manage to stick 
to their new regime indefinitely.

How long will your diet last this year?

But in the naughty corner, 21 per cent last just one week, and 34 per cent until only January 15.

The survey of 750 adults by money saving website NetVoucherCodes.co.uk found that almost a third of slimming hopefuls (29 per cent) chose to join a slimming club, claiming this was the only way they were able to stay on track and keep the pounds off.

Twenty seven per cent followed an online diet and weight loss plan, with the majority (43 per cent) choosing to watch what they eat, cutting out sweet and savoury treats and alcohol.

Just one per cent opted to pay for a diet plan which includes ready prepared meals.

One respondent said: 'Losing weight is one of my resolutions every year. Normally I watch what I eat but it never works.

'I get too tempted by the biscuits in the cupboard or even worse, end up finishing off my kids' meals before I have my own.

'This year I’m definitely trying a slimming club. Fingers crossed that’ll do the trick and losing weight will never again be on my list of resolutions.'

Steve Barnes from NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, said: 'People do take weight loss seriously, especially after the excesses of Christmas and the New Year, but it seems most of us falter just after we hit the two week mark.

'f you’re the only one in your family trying to lose weight or the only person within your group of friends, then it can be really tough.

'It's too easy to say you’ll just have one glass of wine or one chocolate - it never works. Once you’ve been tempted, then that's it.

'I think it's much harder if you decide to go it alone without any support.

'If you join a club or follow an online plan then you have other people to rally round when the going gets tough and you're tempted to pack it in.
