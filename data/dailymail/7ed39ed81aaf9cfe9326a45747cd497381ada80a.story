Mad Men fans will be able to take a stroll through Don Draper's swinging 1960s office and see Megan Draper's iconic 'Zou Bisou Bisou' dress in person with the debut of a museum exhibition dedicated to the AMC series.

In celebration of the show's final season return on April 5, the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York, has recreated some of Mad Men's most iconic large-scale sets as a part of its exhibit honoring the drama's stage designs, retro costumes and key props.

'Mad Men is much more than a popular television series, it has become a cultural touchstone inspiring a renewed interest in a critical time in the country’s history,' the museum's curator Barbara Miller said in a statement.  

Work break: Don Draper (Jon Hamm) lounges inside his office at Sterling Cooper & Partners. A replica of the set will appear at the Museum of the Moving Image's upcoming Matthew Weiner's Mad Men exhibit 

Iconic design: Megan Draper (Jessica Paré) sang Zou Bisou Bisou in this little black dress during season five. Her costume will be featured at the museum from March 14 to June 14

Named after the show's creator Matthew Weiner, the exhibit, which will fun from March 14 to June 14, will feature stage designs, more than 25 iconic costumes, hundreds of props, advertising art and video clips, as well as Mr Weiner's personal notes and research material.

In addition to Don's swanky office at Sterling Cooper & Partners, some highlights of Matthew Weiner's Mad Men include a replica of the Draper family kitchen from their home in Ossining, New York, Joan Holloway's red dress and the box of mementos revealing Don's true identity. 

After the exhibition ends, a number of props and costumes will remain in the museum's permanent collection. 

Mr Weiner will also make an appearance at the museum on March 20 to discuss the creation and production of the series following the exhibition's March 14 opening. 

And for anyone eager to get more Mad Men action, the show's creator has also curated a series of 10 films that inspired the series, including Vertigo, The Apartment, Les Bonnes Femmes, and The Americanization of Emily.

Required Viewing: Mad Men’s Movie Influences kicks off on March 14 and ends April 26. 

Retro design: The Drapers' kitchen from Don's home in Ossining, New York, is another set that will be on view at the exhibition

1960s interiors: Don's office features a wooden bar cart, red chairs, and a view of Madison Avenue

Triple threat: Mad Men creator, writer and producer Matthew Weiner appeared with the cast and crew on the show's season six set

'The films chosen by Matt Weiner yield tremendous insight into Mad Men’s approach to character, tone, and atmosphere,' the museum's chief curator David Schwartz said in a statement. 

He added: 'And the films are great; they should be required viewing for fans of the show as well as its creative team.'

Earlier this week, AMC released new promo photographs that featured an uncomfortable Don joined by his ex-wife Betty, his new wife Megan Draper and his teenage daughter Sally, sparking questions about the fate of show's characters.

While part one of Mad Men's seventh season ended last May, Mr Weiner has remained tight lipped about how the show will end. 

'Can’t tell you that, you got to watch,' he told Deadline after the midseason finale. 'You’ll have to see how we bring it all together.'

As for fans' expectations for the final seven episodes, he said: 'We don’t want to punch them in the face. We want them to walk away changed or better or at least entertained by it. That’s all I can say.'

But Mr Weiner was adamant that the series will be completely done after this season's last batch of episodes - without any possible sequels or spinoffs.  

A woman scorned: New promo images show Don sitting next to his ex-wife Betty Francis (January Jones), his current wife Megan Draper (Jessica Paré) and his teenage daughter Sally Draper (Kiernan Shipka)

Unlikely friends: Betty and Megan join Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks) and Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) in this season seven image
