Will England qualify for the knockout stages?

This time Andre Pirlo did his damage without touching the ball. It was a beautiful dummy, one which suckered in Daniel Sturridge and created the space for Claudio Marchisio to fire Italy ahead, with the crispest of drives.

The Italians (and the natives of Manaus) celebrated in style and without injuring anyone in the process, but there would still be work to do in a wide-open contest. Here were two teams with reputations for strength at the back, who can be turgid, especially in the group stages of a tournament like this, producing an absolute thriller.

The round-by-round Rumble in the Jungle verdict

Round 1 (0-15 minutes): The old master and his young challenger stand off each other at first, with Welbeck more concerned with attacking and Pirlo unbothered, but the Italian fools England’s number 11 seconds before the end of the round with a dummy which eventually leads to nothing.

Round 2 (15-30 minutes): Pirlo is dictating the play for Italy now. Welbeck looks dangerous out wide but leaves his man to take over in the middle with the two fighters backing off each other for now.

Round 3 (30-45 minutes): The bearded maestro almost turns Welbeck’s cross into his own net before inspiring his team’s best moment, dummying on the edge of the area to fool the Englishman and allow the ball to break to Marchisio who slams home the opener.

Round 4 (45-60 minutes): Pirlo controls the contest from range, not allowing himself to get drawn into a battle with his younger counterpart.

Round 5 (60-75 minutes): Seconds into the 60th minute and it’s a knock-out as Roy Hodgson throws in the towel for Welbeck and he’s withdrawn from the contest.

Italy left 
holes, England left more and what a delight it was for Pirlo, one of the
 finest midfielders of his generation with a gift for visualising the 
game, and unpicking it with his passing and control. Two years on from 
Kiev, a few degrees hotter with more hair on his face, he is still a 
delight to watch and a master play-maker.

Each
 touch of the ball has an effortless caress, be it a two-yard roll of 
the ball or the sort of 40-yard pass he threaded behind Leighton Baines 
in the opening couple of minutes, or which he slid through on the 
counter-attack late on for Ciro Immobile.

So
 much for the friendly handshake in the tunnel with Roy Hodgson, the man
 he claimed called him Pirla, a light-hearted term of offence in 
northern Italy, when he was manager of Inter Milan. He meant business.

Pirlo
 captained his team in the absence of Gianluigi Buffon, but could 
England tame him? That would be the key from the outset. Jordan 
Henderson had worked in training to monitor his movement, with Jack 
Wilshere as the Pirlo double.

Yet
 Henderson did not want to leave Steven Gerrard’s side as they tried to 
shield their back-four and Pirlo was content to play from deep, 
particularly when he worked out Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva – 
Italy’s dominant forces - were tormenting England’s left side.

All
 the threat came from the Italian right. Pirlo noted this, and 
manoeuvred the ball that way, sliding passes into the gaps where Wayne 
Rooney had not tracked the runner or Leighton Baines had been dragged 
out of position.

It
 is a sign of his understanding of the game. He stands where there is 
room and the game gravitates his way. It is not an accident.

There is 
no-one in English football to match. He protects the ball never gives it
 away and his head is always swivelling around, looking for openings, 
checking out the movement around him.

Making his mark: Pirlo got around the pitch and helped Italy to their win

There
 was no 'Panenka' chipped penalty – although Italy may have deserved a 
spot-kick when he clipped the ball past Glen Johnson in the first-half 
and the full-back blocked it with his arm. There was no delicious 
free-kick – although he went mighty close in stoppage time.

Instead,
 here was another 90 minutes where England never quite got a grip on 
him. It may be for the last time. He will retire from international 
football after this World Cup. In the meantime, enjoy him.

And, perhaps, English midfielders can learn what he does.
