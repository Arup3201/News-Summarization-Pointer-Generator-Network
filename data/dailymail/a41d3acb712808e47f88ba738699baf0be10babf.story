This £400,000 luxury motorhome was destroyed in a 'huge fireball' when an on board gas canister exploded while the owner's family slept just a few yards away.

The plush Hymer van had been parked outside the family home in Oswestry, Shropshire when it went up in flames shortly after 4.50am today, causing one of two gas canisters on board to explode.

The force of the blast, likened to a bomb, sent the canister hurtling into the air before it landed 100m away down the street, while the vehicle was completely destroyed in the blaze.

Before: A neighbour said the family had been preparing to take the Hymer van, pictured on Google Streetview before the blast, on holiday when it caught fire

Fire investigators were tonight treating the fire, which also spread to the porch and second floor window of the house, as a suspected arson attack.

The owners of the motorhome, who had been preparing to take it on their summer holiday, were inside their home at the time of the explosion but managed to scramble to safety.

'It must have been about 5am when there was this almighty bang, like a bomb going off,' said Malcolm Parry, 70, who lives opposite the house.

'I looked outside the window and could see a huge fireball rising into the air. The flames were higher than the house and the motorhome was just engulfed in flames.

'I rushed out the front because I know the chap who lives there is called Taff and he was getting his motorhome ready to go away.

'Luckily I saw him running out the house. There were clouds of black smoke billowing up everywhere. I opened the door to get out and I could feel the heat then.

'A young lad was out passing on his way to work and he was on the phone ringing up the fire brigade.

'In about 10 minutes or so the flames were higher than the bungalow itself. It was a huge fire.

'It was lucky someone was coming along to see the fire when they did, or they might not have noticed it until it was much bigger.

'I spoke to the firefighters at the scene and they said it looked like a possible arson attack but it might be too early to tell for sure.'

Destruction: One neighbour said he saw plumes of black smoke coming from the home, while another called the fire brigade

The road was cordoned off for the rest of the morning while fire fighters from Oswestry, Ellesmere and Baschurch tackled the blaze and cleared up the area.

'There were two people in the property who both made their escape,' said Ian Leigh, Fire Service station manager and fire investigation officer for Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service.

'They were awakened by two passers-by.

'The damage to the house is fairly significant. There’s damage to the front roof section and crews continue to work to make sure that’s as safe as possible.

'There were two gas cylinders, one of which exploded. We’ve got debris up to 100m away.

'It highlights how dangerous gas canisters can be when involved in a fire - they can go bang.'

The fire service confirmed they were not ruling out an arson attack.
