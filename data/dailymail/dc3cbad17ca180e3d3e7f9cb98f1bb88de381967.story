Men start becoming ‘invisible’ sexually to younger women at 39 - the same age as David Beckham and Russell Brand, according to new research.

They begin turning into ‘The Invisible Man’ from the end of their 30s onwards - and are viewed more as father figures than sex symbols.

The most obvious sign of the change is when a man is no longer eyed up by women when he goes out.

Has he lost his Becks appeal? At 39, David Beckham is at the age when men apparently become 'invisible' sexually to younger women, right, and, left, back in 2005 when he was 30

Other ways to work out if you have turned into The Invisible Man are the first flecks of grey hair and the emergence of a double chin.

David Beckham was pictured last month showing grey hair in his beard - but days later all the silver had disappeared, suggesting he had resorted to dyeing it.

They're invisible too! Russell Brand, left, and Bradley Cooper are also at the age where women believe the first flecks of grey hair and the emergence of a double chin make them unattractive

Other famous 39-year-olds include the comedian Russell Brand and Hollywood stars Bradley Cooper and Leonardo DiCaprio.

In the survey, 52 per cent of respondents said that men start to lose their allure to opposite sex as they are about to turn 40. This was due to a number of factors - not all concerned with ageing.

1. Women no longer eye you up in a bar2. Greying hair 3. Double chin4. Thinning hair5. Bad teeth

Six out of ten women (62 per cent) assume that most men in their late 30s are attached by that age and are not worth approaching.

No longer being chatted up or eyed up on a night out was the clearest sign for both sexes that a man had become invisible - chosen by 54 per cent of respondents.

The second most popular sign was greying hair - picked by 37 per cent of those surveyed. Other signs included a double chin, thinning hair and having bad teeth.

A spokesperson from the Crown Clinic Manchester, who commissioned the survey, said: 'Turning 40 is key turning point and it is the most popular age for men to seek a hair transplant.

'You only have to look at Robbie Williams to see how true that is. He turned 40 in February and admitted having a transplant to fill out his temples where he had started to lose his hair. He clearly didn’t want to become "The Invisible Man".'

Has Leo lost it? Six out of ten women assume that most men in their late 30s, like Leonardo DiCaprio, pictured, left, this year and, right, aged 25 in The Beach in 2000, are attached by that age and are not worth approaching
