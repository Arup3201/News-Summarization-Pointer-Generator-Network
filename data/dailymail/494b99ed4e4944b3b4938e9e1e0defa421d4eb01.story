A man deliberately cut his arms with saws in the aisles of a Home Depot store in suburban Los Angeles Wednesday, creating a gruesome scene in front of several horrified customers.

The man was in the store's tool section and went unnoticed until he began grabbing several small saws, including one meant to cut sheet rock, and started using them on his arms.

‘He cut both arms with hand saws down to the bone,’ said West Covina police Cpl. Rudy Lopez.

Officers received several 911 calls and arrived to find the man lying unconscious in the aisle in a pool of blood.

An off-duty paramedic from the Pasadena Fire Department had been shopping nearby, and with help from police collected twine and rags from store shelves and put makeshift tourniquets on both arms, a move Lopez said probably saved the man's life.

Police received a 911 call at around 12.20pm from the home improvement store on Azusa Avenue in West Covina about a man who has injured himself.

Witnesses say the man picked up several hand saws and started cutting his arms.

'He just began sawing away,' Lopez told KTLA. 'He was pretty much intent on doing what he did.'

The off-duty paramedic and officers who arrived on the scene helped stop the heavy blood flow.

The man was taken to Queen of the Valley Medical Center where he underwent surgery. As of Wednesday night, no information has been released on his condition.

The unnamed man, who looked to be in his 40s, was carrying no identification, has been unable to answer questions, and was not heard saying anything in the store, so police do not know why he cut himself, Lopez said.

Police interviewed about five people who said they saw what happened, and Lopez said there were likely many more who quickly left the disturbing scene.

‘It was pretty graphic,’ he said.

The West Covina home improvement business remained closed for the rest of the day after the gruesome incident.
