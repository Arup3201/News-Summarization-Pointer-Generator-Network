Death crash: Victoria McClure, 38, killed a cyclist after taking her eyes off the road while she fiddled with her sat-nav, Reading Crown Court heard

A mother killed a cyclist after taking her eyes off the road for almost 20 seconds as she fiddled with her sat-nav in her car, a jury heard yesterday.

Victoria McClure, 38, 'drove blind' as she attempted to use the zoom function on the device while driving down a 60mph road, the court was told.

There was no evidence that she braked before crashing into 46-year-old cyclist Anthony Hilson near Twyford, Berkshire, on a long straight section of road, the jury heard.

Mr Hilson, who was out for an early Sunday morning ride, died after suffering 'devastating and unsurvivable' injuries.

McClure, who was on the way to a baby shower, has admitted causing death by careless driving but denies the more serious offence of causing death by dangerous driving.

Prosecutor Matthew Walsh said motorists on the A4 Bath Road where the married father was killed would have typically had about 500m of clear visibility.

'Assuming for a moment she's 
travelling at the speed limit of 60mph, it takes about 18 seconds to 
cover the distance - that's the length of time she would have had the 
cyclist in her view,' he said.

'In other words, she had a window of 
about 18 seconds - maybe more, of course, if she was going slower - 
approaching the cyclist in order to see him.

'But she didn't. Did she try and take any avoiding action, braking or steering?

'Well, from the witnesses that were in the general area, nobody heard the sound of braking or horns or anything of that nature.

'There weren't any skidmarks on the road to suggest emergency braking or any evasive action.'

McClure was at the wheel of her Honda Accord when she crashed into the cyclist on September 16 last year.

The jury was told steering lightly to the right would have been enough to pass Mr Hilson as he travelled in the same direction on his Specialized road bike.

McClure said at the roadside and in a police interview that she had taken her eyes off the road to use her sat-nav, the court heard.

She allegedly told police officers she had been zooming in on her sat-nav and added: 'I looked up and it was too late. In the blink of an eye I just hit him. I didn't think I was going that fast.'

There was no suggestion McClure had been speeding, Mr Walsh added.

During her police interview she was asked if she could offer any explanation as to where Mr Hilson had come from.

She replied: 'I think the cyclist was there all the time. I think I just didn't see him.'

McClure had admitted causing death by careless driving, Mr Walsh told jurors.

'In other words, she accepts she caused Mr Hilson's death that day, she says by careless driving.

'The prosecution say it goes beyond that, it was more than careless driving - it was dangerous driving.

Crash scene: The accident happened on a long straight section of the A4 Bath Road (pictured) near Twyford, Berkshire, the court was told

'To in effect drive blind for upwards of 18 seconds is dangerous driving.'

A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Hilson had died of severe head and chest injuries.

Mother-of-two McClure wept in court today as she recalled the moment she collided with the cyclist after taking her eyes off the road 'for milliseconds'.

She said between sobs: 'There was no time to do anything - swerve or brake.

'For the cyclist, for his family, I don't stop thinking about it and I feel very sorry about it.'

McClure, a paediatrician turned 
housewife, told the jury how she noticed the map on her satnav was more 
zoomed in than normal after her children had been playing in the car.

While continuing to drive, McClure tried to zoom it out to see the route it was taking her to in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.

She added: 'It looked as if it was going to take me and hour to get to Berkhamsted rather than 45 minutes.

Accused: McClure outside court where she is standing trial accused of causing death by dangerous driving. She has already admitted the less serious charge of causing death by careless driving

'It was zoomed in. I could only see the road but nothing more...I wanted to see the entire road on the screen to see which way it was sending me. I glanced at it for milliseconds.'

McClure said she pressed the zoom out button and 'looked straight back at the road'. She then 'glanced' back at the satnav and realised it hadn't zoomed out enough.

'It was always at different zoom levels at different times. The children when the car was parked often fiddled with the satnav so it could be anything,' she explained.

'I pressed the zoom out button again. I looked down to press the button and looked straight up.'

McClure then suddenly burst into tears as her defence barrister Alistair McDonald continued: 'Had you seen the cyclist before?'

'No, I hadn't,' she replied, adding: 'He was on his bicycle. He was on it, but I didn't see anything else.

'There was no time to do anything - swerve or brake,' she trailed off as she burst into floods of tears.

The jury heard how McClure was 'hysterical' by the roadside after the crash and told stunned witnesses: 'What have I done? I have probably wrecked some lives. If I have, how am I going to live with this?'

McClure, of Charvil, Reading, denies a single count of causing death by dangerous driving but has admitted causing death by careless driving.

The case continues.
