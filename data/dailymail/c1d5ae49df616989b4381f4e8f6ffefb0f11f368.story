David de Gea's fine form for Manchester United is being rewarded at international level as Spain coach Vicente del Bosque appears set to hand him a rare start against Holland on Tuesday.

De Gea features on the front of both Marca and AS as Spain look for revenge against the team that thrashed them 5-1 at the 2014 World Cup in their opening game of the tournament in Brazil.

Marca makes comparisons between De Gea and former Manchester United and Holland goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who played at the venue for Tuesday's friendly, the Amsterdam Arena, for Ajax in his career.

AS leads with a picture of De Gea making what has become a trademark one-handed diving save in training as Iker Casillas, the man he is replacing, looks on.

The paper adds that De Gea 'faces a great test' with Del Bosque set to heavily rotate for the encounter against Guus Hiddink's side.

Meanwhile in Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport demand Italy to 'step on the gas' as they prepare to play England in a friendly in Turin.

The paper adds that 'it is never a friendly with England'.

Corriere dello Sport leads with the fury of Juventus fans that the Italian Football Association (FIGC) have covered up the number 32 around the stadium of the Italian giants, which represents the amount of times they have won the Scudetto.

They also feature on Antonio Conte's return to the club he left to take the job of Italy manager after their exit from the World Cup last year.Â
