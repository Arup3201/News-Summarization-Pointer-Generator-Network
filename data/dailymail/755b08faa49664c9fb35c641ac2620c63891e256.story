A Maine man has been charged with throwing his three-month-old son down a flight of stairs, causing a skull fracture.

Authorities say 39-year-old William Lord Jr. was charged with aggravated assault and domestic violence assault on a child less than six-years-old, as well as domestic violence terrorizing.

He was held in lieu of $5,000 cash bail following a court hearing Monday afternoon.

Police say the child was unsecured in a car safety seat when the intoxicated Lord threw him down the stairs at about 3.30am Monday.

Charged: William Lord Jr., 39, was charged with aggravated assault and domestic violence assault on a child less than six years old, as well as domestic violence terrorizing, for allegedly throwing his son down the stairs

The boy's mother took the child to the hospital where he was treated for skull fracture that is not considered life threatening.

According to WLBZ2, Lord went to bed after his partner left the house. 

He was woken Tuesday morning by police, who called for him to come out of the house on a PA system.

Lord came outside and was arrested.

The child's mother, Ericka Melanson, 21, told police that Lord had recently been fired and was becoming increasingly difficult, according to The Portland Press Herald. 

She told police she feared Lord would have shot her if she didn't leave.

'Ericka advised that on several different occasions, William has made comments that if she brings police to the residence again, he will shoot the police and will feel bad for their families,' police wrote in an affidavit.  

Lord is being held in jail and it's unclear if he has a lawyer.

Police said there was another child in the house that was not injured.
