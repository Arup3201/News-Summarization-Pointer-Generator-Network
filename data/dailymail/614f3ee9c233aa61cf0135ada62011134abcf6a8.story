A man who was feared dead after the truck he was driving exploded and tore apart a section of highway joked about having a headache when his rescuers arrived. 

The B-double truck, carrying more than 50 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, exploded on the Mitchell Highway in central Queensland last Friday night.

The driver had crawled from the truck's cabin and was lying on the road wrapped in a torn blanket when a police officer responding to the explosion found him.

Constable Kenric Head said he feared the man was dead until 'he blinked'.

'We tried to talk to him about the footy but he didn't follow the footy. But he did sort of joke with us, saying "I have got a f***ing headache",' he told the Courier Mail.

A B-double truck, carrying more than 50 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, exploded on the Mitchell Highway in central Queensland last Friday night

The fire truck, which was called to the scene after reports a truck had driven off a bridge and into a creek, was destroyed when the B-double suddenly exploded

Four firefighters and a police officer were also injured after the truck exploded as they were responding to reports it had rolled over after driving off the bridge.

The blast was so powerful it obliterated a fire truck and destroyed a bridge, hurling one 250kg chunk of reinforced concrete into the air causing it to land 350 metres away. 

Police who were on their way to the crash site were hit with sonic waves that felt like a 'kick to the chest' from more than a kilometre away.

Geoscience Australia registered a 2.0 magnitude earthquake at 10.12pm initially thought to be due to the ferocity of the explosion. 

Charleville Police Station senior sergeant Adrian Rieck told Queensland Country Life it was a catastrophic explosion.

'It literally destroyed the road,' he said.

'We literally had 53 tonnes of ammonium nitrate go off – it was like having a 53 tonne bomb explode and those people who went into assist without fear for their lives should be commended.'

A Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) spokesman said two of the four injured firefighters were still recovering in hospital after the incident.

The police officer, the two other firefighters and two men who witnessed the crash all received minor injuries and were taken to Charleville Hospital for treatment.

The truck driver was airlifted to Brisbane hospital suffering serious but not life-threatening injuries.
