Efficient: Rob Rhinehart developed the all-in-one meal drink after becoming fed up with the amount of time and money he spent cooking

A man who tired of wasting time and energy cooking and eating claims to have come up with a novel solution - a cocktail that contains all the nutrients he needs to survive.

Rob Rhinehart – a 24-year-old software engineer from Atlanta - says he became fed up with the inordinate amount of time and money he spent cooking.

Determined to spend his time - and money - more effectively, he developed an 'all-in-one' drink to give him his complete fill of vitamins and minerals, according to the website vice.com.

He claims the beige concoction - which bears a striking resemblance to pancake batter - 'tastes great' and he has yet to tire of it after six weeks.

Called  Soylent, he believes it contains all the vital elements of a balanced diet, but with just a third of the calories.

Mr Rhinehart says his inspiration for the cocktail came from seeing an elderly family friend fall ill.

He told Vice.com: 'I was home for Christmas and saw an elderly family friend get admitted to the hospital after losing an unhealthy amount of weight. He was losing strength in one of his arms and found it very difficult to cook.'

'I started wondering why something as simple and important as food was still so inefficient, given how streamlined and optimised other modern things are. 

'I also had an incentive to live as cheaply as possible, and I yearned for the productivity benefit of being healthy. I'd been reading a lot of books on biology and I started to think that it's probably all the same to our cells whether it gets nutrients from a powder or a carrot.'

He maintains that Soylent contains everything the body needs in terms of vitamins, minerals and nutrients such as essential amino acids, carbohydrates and fat.

His stance is that it's the minerals fruit and vegetables contain that are important, rather than the actual produce. 

He
 explained: 'We need carbs, not bread. Amino acids, not milk. It's still
 fine to eat these whenever you want, but not everyone can afford them 
or has the desire to eat them.'

Complete package: He maintains that his meal replacement, Soylent, contains everything the body needs in terms of vitamins, minerals and nutrients such as essential amino acids, carbohydrates and fat

When it comes to fat, he uses olive oil and fish oil, but it's more complex in terms of carbohydrates.

He uses an oligosaccharide, which he claims takes the body longer to metabolise than fructose or table sugar, therefore giving a steady flow of energy for a longer period of time.

Other 'non-essential' additions are antioxidants and probiotics.

While it sounds like a food-lover's worst nightmare, Mr Rhinehart maintains not having to worry about food a welcome relief.

He said: 'No groceries, dishes, deciding what to eat, no endless conversations weighing the relative merits of gluten-free, keto, paleo or vegan. 

'Power and water bills are lower. I save hours a day and hundreds of dollars a month. I feel liberated from a crushing amount of repetitive drudgery.

'It's a very "complete" sensation, more
 sweet than anything. Eating to me is a leisure activity, like going to 
the movies, but I don't want to go to the movies three times a day.

'If I had any money or a girlfriend I would probably eat out more often,' he concedes.  

He claims the beige concoction - which bears a striking resemblance to pancake batter - 'tastes great' and he has yet to tire of it after six weeks

He estimates he was spending $220 on groceries, and another $250 eating out for lunch and the occasional dinner. Now, consuming only Soylent costs him around $50 month.

He adds that because he has such control over his diet, he finds it easy to lose weight by changing the proportions of nutrients in his drink.

Of his sceptics, he says he understands it, adding that many nutrition experts and academics have expressed an interest in his work.

But he added: 'Bad scepticism is stuff like, "This is stupid. You 
can't live on powders and chemicals, you need healthy, fresh food!"'

Going forward, he hopes his findings could help with world hunger.

But Zoe Harcombe, a nutritionist and 
author of several books, including 'The Obesity Epidemic: What caused 
it? How can we stop it?' is sceptical about Mr Rhinehart's approach.

She told MailOnline: 'Food is not 
only vital, but enjoyable. It really doesn't take that long to fry egg 
and bacon or warm porridge for breakfast or sizzle a steak for dinner.

Carbohydrates (200g): Protein (50g): Fat (65g): Sodium (2.4g): Potassium (3.5g): Chloride (3.4g): Fibre (5g): Calcium (1g): Iron (18mg): Iodine (150ug): Magnesium (400mg): Zinc (15mg): Selenium (70ug): Copper (2mg): Manganese (2mg): Chromium (120ug): Molybdenum (75ug):  Vitamin A (5000IU):  Vitamin B6 (2mg): Vitamin B12 (6ug):  Vitamin C (60mg): Vitamin D (400IU): Vitamin E (30IU): Vitamin K (80ug): Thiamin (1.5mg): Riboflavin (1.7mg): Niacin (20mg): Folate (400ug): Biotin (300ug): Panthothenic Acid (10mg): Plus extras not considered essential:  Lycopene (500ug): Omega-3 Fatty Acids(750mg): Ginseng (50ug): Gingko Biloba (100ug): Lutein (500ug): Alpha Carotene (140ug): Vanadium (100ug)

'There is one circumstance where I 
could see a benefit for such a product, but we already have one. Complan
 (From the words COMplete and PLANned) was apparently introduced as an 
essential nutritional supplement for soldiers during the Second World 
War.

'There is also no guarantee that his micro nutrients (vitamins and minerals) are in the form that the body needs.

'As for the product itself, contrary to what Rob says, we do not need carbohydrate - and certainly not 200g of the stuff.

Soylent is 50 per cent carb, 13 per cent protein and 37 per cent fat - better than the 55/15/30 guidelines from our governments, but still not as good as just eating real food (meat, eggs and dairy, fish, nuts,  fruit and vegetables) and letting the macro nutrients (carbs, fat and protein) being what they will be (naturally high in protein and fat and low in carbohydrate).'

She added that the measures detailed 
for a daily intake are also way too low in calories. 'His product 
details 200g of carb, 50g protein and 65g fat daily. That approximates 
to 1,585 calories. The UK recommendations are for 2,079 and 2,605 for 
women and men respectively.'
