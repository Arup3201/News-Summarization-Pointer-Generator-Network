There was plenty of the green, green grass of home that England crave on the Lord’s pitch on Tuesday but whether it will lead to a livelier second Investec Test when battle commences on Thursday remains to be seen.

Rarely have 22 yards of turf led to such debate but three moribund surfaces in three Tests this summer, including at the home of cricket when Sri Lanka visited last month, meant all eyes were on groundsman Mick Hunt’s creation on Tuesday.

Those eyes included those of ECB’s head of pitches Chris Wood, who spent an hour taking samples from the surface in company with long-serving Hunt and MCC chief executive Derek Brewer as the search for pace and bounce goes on.

Later Alastair Cook, Peter Moores and Paul Downton, England’s managing director, congregated in the middle and it was not difficult to decipher that it was the pitch that was dominating their long conversation.

On the surface there appeared plenty of moisture — and the pitch stayed covered for most of the day to retain it — but appearances can be deceptive and Stuart Broad for one remained sceptical about any long overdue signs of life.

‘Looks a little more like English conditions,’ said former England captain Michael Vaughan on Twitter about a very green looking square. ‘It looked like that two days before the Sri Lanka Test,’ replied Broad. ‘The key is Thursday.’

England would be wise to be cynical. The extra grass at the start of the first Test against Sri Lanka here encouraged Angelo Mathews to put England into bat but he then watched them rack up the small matter of 575 for nine.

Conditions got easier and easier for batting as the Test went on, a familiar tale this season, and the famously independent Hunt, MCC’s longest serving employee, is not one to bend to the demands of a frustrated home side.

It was left to John Stephenson, MCC’s head of cricket, to insist that Lord’s are doing their all to try to provide both a better surface and better entertainment for another packed house over the next five days.

‘We are just trying to produce the best possible pitch we can,’ said the former Essex and England opener. ‘It’s not an exact science but we are doing our best to make one with carry and bounce. We are going through our normal processes.’

The usually personable Hunt, who has been preparing Lord’s pitches for 30 years, was reluctant to say anything on Tuesday about what might happen here, with Test groundsmen suddenly becoming the unwelcome centre of attention.

England are privately livid about conditions that have played into the hands of opponents at a time when they simply cannot catch a break and India could not believe their luck when they saw what had been prepared at Trent Bridge.

This is a huge match for England, without a win in nine long Tests, and a captain in Cook who cannot afford the consequences that a combination of defeat here and his 26th failure in succession to hit a Test century might bring.

Little more than half the England team were at Lord’s on Tuesday, with a schedule that sees five Tests in six weeks forcing Peter Moores to tell Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Liam Plunkett, Ben Stokes and Matt Prior to put their feet up.

Prior would usually have a long wicketkeeping session with Bruce French two days out from a Test but his absence was confirmation that his body is starting to betray him and he needs to prove both fitness and form here.

Recalled: Simon Kerrigan is back in the England team after a disappointing debut during the Ashes

One man who was at Lord’s was spinner Simon Kerrigan, who continued his rehabilitation after the horrors of his Test debut at the Oval last summer with a long bowl that did little to suggest he is ready to return on Thursday.

The inclusion of Kerrigan in England’s 14-man squad is confirmation that he remains next in line in the X factor-like search for a spinner but it would be both a surprise and a major gamble if Cook and Moores threw him in now.

Kerrigan had a difficult day bowling for Lancashire against Notts at Liverpool on Monday and his bowling this season has been some way short of the levels that led to his shock call-up for the last Ashes Test in the first place.

If England really did want to pick him at Lord’s they would have to either drop a seamer — and that would lead to even more work for Anderson and Broad — or Moeen Ali, a move that would not make sense after the Worcestershire all-rounder’s startlingly good century at Headingley which almost saved England.

The presence of Kent off-spinner Adam Riley in the nets was proof that Kerrigan is not the only slow bowling option available to England but they would be best advised to persevere with the under-used Moeen’s off-breaks for now.

The farcical end to the first Test on a farce of a pitch at Trent Bridge at least appeared to give England another part-time spinning option in the form of Gary Ballance, who delivered a more than acceptable over of leg-spin.

‘I was quite nervous before I bowled because I wasn’t expecting it,’ said Ballance, England’s second highest runscorer this summer behind Joe Root. ‘I was just glad the first one landed and after that I had a bit of confidence. I might get a few more overs in the nets now and we’ll see how we go from there.’

Where England need to go from here is to a victory that would end their worst winless run for more than 20 years but whether the pitch will help them achieve that remains the most sensitive of subjects for everyone involved.

Groundsmen in England have become the unwelcome centre of attention this summer after producing three lifeless tracks on the spin (pardon the pun). But what’s the difference between a raging turner and a featherbed? Sportsmail explains all… 

GREEN, GREEN GRASS OF HOME

Traditionally in England, groundsmen produce green wickets, i.e. they have a good covering of grass. Grassy pitches lead to more movement off the seam for the faster bowlers.

The grass helps James Anderson and Co because deliveries lose very little pace when they hit the deck, as the slick grass lubricates the surface and reduces friction. The ball deviates more readily because the seam bites into the grass while the rest of the ball slides through with little resistance.

On an ideal Test wicket, any hint of green should then be burned away by the sun as a match progresses, bringing spinners into play.

But this summer, because of a combination of excellent drainage (sucking moisture out of pitches) and groundsmen being encouraged to prepare flat tracks that hardly deteriorate to fill county coffers, England’s speedsters have been given back-breaking surfaces to bowl on which are slow and low, with batsmen’s edges often failing to carry to the slips.

FEATHERBEDS

Wickets in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are often prepared without a blade of grass on them. Flat strips of turf which bake under a hot sun are known as 'featherbeds'.

These are paradise for batsmen to bat on, but they should eventually deteriorate which brings the bowlers into play. The footmarks created by pacemen bring spinners into the game, while the cracks that appear lead to uneven bounce which benefits quick and slow bowlers.

A pitch which spins heavily is often referred to as a “Bunsen”, as in Bunsen burner = raging turner.

PACE AND BOUNCE

Pitches in Australia and South Africa are also hard and true but they are nothing like the dead pitches from Asia.

The strips at grounds like the Waca (Perth) and the Gabba (Brisbane) have plenty of pace and bounce because of an even covering of grass, a different soil type and a complete absence of moisture. This has Mitchell Johnson and Co licking their lips, and would be much palatable for Anderson and Co than the dead tracks which have been served up this summer.
