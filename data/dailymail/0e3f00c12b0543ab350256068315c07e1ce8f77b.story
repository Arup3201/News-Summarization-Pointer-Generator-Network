A mother has been arrested after allegedly throwing her two young sons to their deaths from a 15th-floor balcony because she was 'fed up' with them.

Galina Ryabkova, 30, was seen looking emotionless on surveillance video taken from the block of flats in Moscow, Russia, in the moments following the incident.

Neighbours in the complex were alerted after hearing the bodies of the boys, aged 4 and 7, hitting the ground.

Shocking: A resident in the complex attempts to talk to Mrs Ryabkova after the incident in an attempt to prevent her from escaping

Despite the efforts of neighbours, the youngsters died before the emergency services arrived.

According to RT, the woman said she was 'fed up with children,' and 'decided to get rid of them'.

The woman - whose husband was away on a business trip - lived on the 8th floor of the building and it is  believed she took the children to the 15th floor before throwing them off on Sunday.

One neighbour in the same apartment block described the horrific scenes following the incident to Life News.

The man, who wished to remain anonymous, said his wife woke him up to say that children were falling out of the building.

The couple ran out to see the two children lying on the ground in front of the main entrance to the complex.

The man added: 'Just at that time their mother was leaving the building. We asked her if these were her children and she replied, emotionlessly, "Yes, I threw them away.‚Äù'

CCTV from the apartment block - as reported by New York Daily News - shows one of the children landing just out of frame at the front of the building.

It then shows Mrs Ryabkova coming downstairs wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.

Investigation: Police officers are pictured arriving at the complex of flats shortly after the incident

As she calmly sits in the lobby of the building, shocked neighbours surround her in an attempt to prevent her from escaping.

The video ends by showing police officers arrive at the building to discover the grim scene and arrest the mother.

It has been reported that Mrs Ryabkova has attempted to kill herself in the past and that her husband may have been cheating on her.

Mrs Ryabkova will be sent to a psychiatric hospital for tests while the investigation into what happened continues.
