A teenage girl has killed herself after bullies punched her, forced her into lockers and stuffed her in trashcans, her devastated family has said.

Elizabeth Nicole Evans, 16, was found dead at her family home in Gloucester, Virginia last week after she endured relentless bullying at the hands of fellow high school students, her father said.

Michael Evans said he was aware of the torment she suffered at Goucester County High School, where she was in the 11th grade, but had no idea just how much she was hurting.

Photographs on her Facebook page show an apparently vivacious teenager who loved wearing brightly-colored clothing and spending time with friends. Her family has not revealed how she died.

Loss: Elizabeth Nicole Evans, 16, killed herself last week after years of bullying at school, her father said

'She was very good at hiding things,' her friend Taylor Hall told WAVY. 'She was hurt, but she didn't show it.'

Mr Evans, who is mourning the loss of his only daughter with his wife Samantha and their son Joseph, said the teasing had gone on for years.

'My daughter has been punched, my daughter
 has been put in lockers, she has been stuffed in trash cans and she was
 tripped going down the hallway,' he said.

'What disgusts me is that my daughter 
looked at everybody the same. She saw the beauty in all of
 them. They didn't treat her that way.'

Heartbroken: Her distraught father Michael Evans said he had asked the school for help but nothing improved

Missed: Friends said she was very good at hiding her pain and had no idea just how much she was hurting

He said he had approached staff at the high school but nothing improved for his daughter.

'They could have stepped up,' Evans said. 'They could have done something.'

Ben Kiser, superintendent of the school district, passed along his condolences to the family but told MailOnline that he did not have information backing up the father's claims.

But he added: 'Gloucester County Public Schools provides
 safe and orderly environments for students to learn and grow. We take 
claims of harassment and bullying very seriously and respond to any in a
 timely manner.'

Mr Evans said that he hopes the tragic passing of his daughter can be a lesson to other teenagers who are struggling at school. He said there will always be someone to listen.

'I won't wish this on my worst enemy,' he said. 'I never felt pain like this before.'

Scene: She attended Gloucester High School where her father said she was tripped and pushed around

Friends paid tribute to Evans, known 
as 'Lizzy' at school, at a memorial service where they poured over 
displayed pictures of her and released balloons.

Her obituary noted that he was a top student and 'a fun-loving young lady who enjoyed spending time with her many friends. She was a free spirit, and a rescuer of friends.'

It added that she enjoyed four wheeling, riding motor cycles and watching movies.

Her father added on Facebook: 'I will miss you always and you will forever be in my heart! I love you and am so proud of you and the young lady you have become! Rest in peace my little angel, we will be together again some day!'
