Kicking back and relaxing with his arms outstretched, this chilled-out frog appears to be loving life as he takes some time out on a water lily leaf.

The little frog is pictured happily perched with his legs stretched out in front of him and enjoying a bit of 'me' time.

The pictures were taken by photographer Angela Nelson, 45, in her home town of Bristol.

She said: 'I found the frog sitting in this unusual position a few times; I took photographs as I had never seen a frog sit like this in ten years of keeping them as pets.

'I was alarmed initially - this kind of behaviour is something I had never encountered before.

'But after closely observing it, I watched it go about its usual daily activities without any problems, so assumed it was just something this lazy frog might do occasionally.'

The Theloderma Corticale is known to live in subtropical or tropical lowland forests, and can be found in countries such as Northern Vietnam or China. 

Its nickname, the 'mossy frog', comes from the fact its skin is mottled green and brown, which creates an effective camouflage when it is sat on rocks.

Angela said: 'I am lucky enough to have a partner who owns three reptile shops, which provides me with endless opportunities to photograph a large array of species.

'I’ve had ten years of experience with reptiles and frogs and always study an animal before photographing it, as it’s vital to know each species different behaviour in order to ensure I can prevent stress.

'Some animals I only keep out for 10 minutes or so, whilst others are content to do their thing for 30 minutes or so.

'I am passionate about reptiles and frogs and I have gone to great lengths over the years to educate people about the care of these creatures in captivity.'
