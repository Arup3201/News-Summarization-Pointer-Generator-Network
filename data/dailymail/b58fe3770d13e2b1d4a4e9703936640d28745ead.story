Boris Johnson and David Cameron rushed to the aid of a woman who collapsed in the street

The Prime Minister and London Mayor were on their way to an event in Harrow, north west London, this morning when they noticed a woman who was unwell on the side of the road.

Their car pulled over in the suburb's Sheepcote Road and Mr Cameron sat with the woman, thought to be in her twenties, until paramedic's arrived. 

Paramedic Dominic Stark, who attended the scene, said: 'The Prime Minister and Boris Johnson had pulled over when they noticed a woman collapsed on the street.

'When I arrived a few minutes later, I found the PM holding the woman's hand. I took over caring for the patient and they left a few minutes later.'

A LAS spokesman said they were called to the scene at 11.19 and a paramedic arrived in three minutes, followed by an ambulance. He added that the woman was taken to hospital and was 'ok'.

A source close to the PM said: 'It is less dramatic than it sounds.'

After spotting the women on the side of the on their way to harrow they got out of the car to 'check she was OK'. At the same time a GP walked passed as stopped to help her, before paramedics arrived on the scene.

Once help had arrived, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson got back into their and continued their journey.

The incident happened as the Tory duo were travelling along Sheepcote Road in Harrow, north west London

The drama happened as the two 
Conservatives sought to present a united front ahead of local and 
European Parliament elections next week.

They travelled on to Harrow Skills Centre, where Mr Johnson tried his hand at mixing cement, while the PM looked on.

They also teamed up for a game of table football, and triumphed over two young men. They are not the first politicians to come to the rescue of a woman in distress.

A year ago Labour leader Ed Miliband was hailed as an 'action hero' after coming to the rescue of a cyclist.

The Labour leader leapt into action after Ella Phillips, 29, was thrown over the handlebar of her bike in North London.

She described the moment he appeared 'out of nowhere' to offer assistance, admitting she almost did not recognise him becoming he was so 'suave' in the flesh.

Miss Phillips fell off her her bike after crashing into a cyclist who suddenly stopped in front of her. 

She was so stunned when she saw the Labour leader looming over her, she thought she must be concussed.

'He mysteriously appeared out of nowhere, a bit like an action hero,' she said at the time.
