Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has heaped more scorn on England by claiming he beat them without even being fully fit in Sao Paulo last week.

Suarez will face Italy with Uruguay in Natal today hoping to inspire the South Americans to the win they need to make it to the next round.

And the 27-year-old has revealed that he scored twice against England last week while suffering from exhaustion and cramps.

Injured: Suarez revealed he was only 50 per cent fit during Uruguay's victory over England

'I was not really 100 per cent fit and sometimes this happens,' he said.

'I was the other day really at the limits of my physical capacity, as I was for the last match with Liverpool last season.

'Last week I was full of cramps and I was tired but of course you have a certain experience and you can build yourself up and come to the next assignment and this is what I am doing.

'I am building myself up again for the game against Italy.' Suarez had knee surgery at the end of the Barclays Premier League season and didn't feature in Uruguay's first game here, a defeat to surprise package Costa Rica in Fortaleza.

But he returned to feature against England and scored twice - the winner coming in the 85th minute - to effectively dump Roy Hodgson and his players out of the competition.

After that game Suarez re-ignited his feud with the English media, who he feels have not portrayed him fairly during his various flirtations with controversy over the last three seasons.

Asked about this by an English journalist during Uruguay's press conference on Monday, he said: 'You work in England, and that was in the papers.

'You should know what happened and I think it was nothing more than just in the papers.

'Everybody knows that in December 2013, I was elected the best player of the year.

'I guess this is very obvious and even the people in the Premier League voted for me and then if the papers vote for me as well that is sensational.

'I did not want to attack anybody, only some media started making fun of me and you are in the media.

'You are in the media, you should know what happened and why they did that to me.'

It is clear that Suarez continues to feel that he is persecuted in the media in England and that will perhaps be a worry for his club Liverpool as they try to keep their star asset out of the clutches of clubs such as Barcelona and Real Madrid.

Suarez signed a new contract at Anfield last season and Liverpool will be determined not to lose him. But it would appear that Suarez is far from happy with life in England.

Halfway there: Suarez says the job is far from over for Uruguay and they must beat Italy to progress

ITALY (4-3-3): Buffon; Abate, Barzagli, Chiellini, Darmian; Cassano,, Pirlo, De Rossi; Insigne, Balotelli, Marchisio.URUGUAY (4-4-2) Muslera; Caceres, Giminez, Godin, A Pereira; Gonzal, Arevalo, Rodrigu, Lodeiro; Suarez, Cavani

On Tuesday in Natal, he will certainly play as Uruguay try to leave another major European nation feeling embarrassed.

With England, Spain and, in all likelihood, Portugal going home after phase one, Italy will certainly be in danger if they don't lift their levels after the dismal defeat to Costa Rica last Thursday.

Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez made no attempt yesterday to mask Suarez's importance.

'Luis is mature now, he has matured nicely and I have told him that,' said Tabarez.

'He is going to go out on to the pitch and he is going to fight.

'I trust him and he knows what to do in the last 20 metres in front of goal.

'You can't lose that, just because you have a meniscus operation. This is something you have from experience on the pitch.

'He put everything he could into overcoming this impediment.

'Having Luis alone does not make us favourites, but we have no doubt Luis's presence will be very important for us against Italy, 'Playing Italy is a gift sent from heaven above. That's the way we see it.

'If we win, it won' t be like winning just another match. It will be a victory against one of the best teams in the world.

'I don't think this match will be characterised by fear. I think it will be characterised by motivation.'
