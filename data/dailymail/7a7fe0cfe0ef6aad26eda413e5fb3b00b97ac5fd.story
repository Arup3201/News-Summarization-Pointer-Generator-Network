Recovery: Tap dance champ Stephanie Still has bounced back from a devastating malignant brain tumour

A dancer who was told she may never walk again after being diagnosed with a rare malignant brain tumour, is now planning to strap on her tap dancing shoes.

Stephanie Still, 21, has made remarkable progress, after undergoing a gruelling 10-hour operation and is now planning to dance at a charity fundraising event.

Ms Still reached the semi-finals of Sky’s Got To Dance with her dance group Tap Attack last February.

But she was diagnosed with a rare malignant brain tumour last May.

A grade three ependymoma, it measured four and a half centimetres across and was removed in a 10 and a half hour operation days later.

Ms Still, a dance and theatre performance student at Bird College in Sidcup, Kent, said: 'It was very big.

'They needed to get it out as soon as they could. If they didn’t, it would not have been long before it did something drastic.'

Captain of the England team that finished second at the World Tap Championships in 2010, she said:

'I was told I would probably never be able to dance again. That was like the end of my life.'

Ms Still was diagnosed after suffering shooting pains in her neck and back for more than a year, which was dismissed by doctors as muscular and the result of strenuous dance routines.

She said: 'It was uncomfortable, but the pain went so I carried on. But then it started to get so bad it made me cry, and I don’t cry easily.

'I was at the height of my fitness and dancing ability and it all went downhill.'

Ms Still was referred to a neurologist, and the tumour was revealed in an MRI scan.

She said: 'I was in shock. I didn’t have any neurological symptoms.'

Following the operation to remove the tumour, Ms Still endured six weeks of intensive radiotherapy.

Ms Still has now organised a fundraising night of dancing and singing with colleagues and teachers from Bird College at St John, the Evangelist Church in Church Road, Sidcup from 7.30pm on June 12.

The show will raise money for Clic Sargent and the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Ms Still, who plans to tap dance at the show, said: 'I had to learn to walk again. I thought if I could do that then I could get back to dancing.

'I would still love to be a dancer.'
