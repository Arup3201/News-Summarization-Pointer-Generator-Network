Patrick Vieira 'can't believe' that Carlo Tavecchio was elected as the new president of the Italian Football Federation amid a furious racism row and says he'd be banished from working in England.

The 71-year-old beat former AC Milan midfielder Demetrio Albertini after three rounds of voting in Rome on Monday but there is widespread outrage that Tavecchio - who allegedly called African players 'banana eaters' last month - has landed the post.

He has drawn heavy criticism after the comment during an address to a summer assembly of Italy's amateur leagues.

Not happy: Patrick Vieira (right, talking to Jason Wilcox) has voiced his displeasure at the election result 

Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini lambasted Tavecchio a fortnight ago, and now Manchester City's Elite Development Squad manager - who played for Juventus, Inter and AC Milan - has registered his dismay. 

'I'm finding it really hard to believe that Carlo Tavecchio has been elected as president of the Italian FA after the comments that he made,' he tweeted. 

'For me, that shows how far away the Italian football authorities are from dealing with discrimination. 63.63% of those that voted are admitting that they aren't fighting against racism, or that they don't want to fight these problems. I played in Italy for years so I know the issues, I saw the issues.

'If he was an Englishman making this kind of comment, politically, he would be completely out.

'This decision was made in football, but I think it is bigger than football. It should make the whole country of Italy look at the message they want to send about what they think about racism.

'I can't believe he will represent the Italian Football Authorities. What a shame.'

Quoted in La Repubblica, Tavecchio had said: 'England identifies the players coming in and, if they are professional, they are allowed to play.

'Here, on the other hand, let's say there's (fictional player) Opti Poba, who has come here, who previously was eating bananas and now is a first-team player for Lazio.

'In England he has to demonstrate his c.v. and his pedigree.'

He subsequently apologised but FIFA has since asked the FIGC to conduct an investigation into the comments and to report its findings back to the world governing body.

Following his election Tavecchio pledged to prove his doubters wrong.

He told FIGC.it: 'I will be a president for everybody, and especially for those who have legitimately expressed their dissent about me taking the job.

'I wish to thank those who have confirmed their confidence in me and who have made me feel supported even during some difficult times.

'Reforming the system can only be done if we work together, there are no magic wands.

'Let us embrace a culture of hard work. I invite all members to abandon feelings of division and to get to work.

'By August 18 I will be able to present to you a list of the things I will have worked on this week.'

Among his first tasks will be selecting a new head coach for the Italian national team.

Cesare Prandelli resigned following a disappointing World Cup, with former Juventus boss Antonio Conte and ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini reportedly leading the race to replace him.
