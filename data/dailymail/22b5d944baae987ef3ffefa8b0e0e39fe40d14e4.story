Brittany Maynard's widower has described their final moments together in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.

Dan Diaz was lying in the bed beside his 29-year-old wife when she drank medication to end her life last month.

Having been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer just six months before, Maynard became the face of America's Right To Die campaign after moving from California to Oregon and setting a date for her own death.

Now, her widower is continuing that battle calling for all states to approve legislation that supports life-ending options for people with terminal illnesses.

'It was peaceful and loving': Dan Diaz has spoken to Oprah about his final moments with Brittany Maynard

Passed away: Diaz's wife controversially chose to end her life with lethal medication last month 

Campaign: Maynard documented her final six months and fought for relaxed laws on the right to die

Launching his campaign, Diaz met with Oprah and explained how Maynard chose seven of her closest friends and relatives - and their dogs Bella and Charlie - to stand around the bed in her final moments.

'The mood in the house was very peaceful, very loving,' he said in an interview that will be screened on Sunday.

Glassy-eyed, he said each person recited a memory to her before she said her own goodbyes.

'She actually wrote on Facebook a message to her friends and said "I love you" to everyone, to me.

'The medication, we brought it in. She was ready.'

Love: The couple married in California but later moved to Oregon where Maynard could end her life

Memories: Diaz said Maynard got seven friends and relatives to each tell her a memory

Diaz is continuing the campaign that Maynard started as he lobbies for new legislation

Maynard's two dogs were in the bed with them when she drank the lethal medicine, Diaz said

Then, she drank the lethal cocktail prescribed by her doctor.

'Within five minutes, she fell asleep. It was very peaceful.'

It comes after Debbie Ziegler, Brittany Maynard's mom, wrote an article for DailyMail.com describing the moment she watched her only daughter die.

'Brittany, my beautiful, brave girl, had passed away purposefully and peacefully just as she planned. Death had been kind, graceful even, and spared Brittany a great deal of physical pain and mental anguish.

'It was a good death.'

A mother's tears: Debbie Ziegler, Maynard's mother, is also campaigning to change laws

Joining Diaz in the campaign for euthanasia, she added: 'But what does a good death look like in America: the land of death phobia? Americans do not like to talk about death. Some say a good death is a natural death, but they often mean dying “in their sleep.”

'Modern medicine has made death seem like a medical failure instead of the natural end of life. The death of a 29-year-old is unthinkable. All of life looms ahead, full of promise.

'We found ourselves as a family: choosing between no more treatment and death – or a treatment plan that felt like torture and then death anyway only a few months later.'

Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act in 1994, but opponents persuaded a federal judge to issue an injunction temporarily blocking the law. Voters in November 1997 overwhelmingly reaffirmed the nation's first aid-in-dying law and it's been in place ever since.

According to state statistics compiled through Dec. 31, 2013:

— People who have used the law since late 1997: 752 (396 men, 356 women)

— People younger than 35 who have used the law: 6

— Median age of the deceased: 71

— Percentage of the deceased who were white: 97

— Percentage who had at least some college: 72

— Percentage of patients who informed relatives of their decision: 94

— Percentage of patients who died at a home: 95 percent

— Median minutes between ingestion of lethal drug and unconsciousness: 5

— Median minutes between ingestion and death: 25

— Number of terminally ill people who have moved to Oregon to die: unknown
