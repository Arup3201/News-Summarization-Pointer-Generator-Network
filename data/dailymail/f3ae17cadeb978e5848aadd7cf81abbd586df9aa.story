In a field outside Kiev, Ukrainians have spent the evening leaping over campfires as they celebrate a traditional Slavic holiday.

People of all ages wore wreaths made from flowers and herbs as they leapt over the fire as part of an ancient rite which is supposed to help cleanse away evil spirits.

Ivan Kupala Day was originally a pagan festival held on the summer solstice, but since the spread of Christianity it has officially become a celebration of John the Baptist - although it still involves pagan activities linked to water, fire and herbs.

The holiday is celebrated in Ukraine and other Slavic countries including Russia and Belarus (pictured)

Ukrainians celebrate the day by 
wearing flowers, swimming in open water and dancing around the fire, 
with girls making wreaths from herbs and floating them on rivers - a 
traditional way of telling their fortunes.

The name of the holiday is made up of
Ivan, the Slavic name for John the Baptist, and Kupala, which is 
derived from the word for bathing.

It is believed water is cleansed of evil and those who swim in it on this day will have good health for a year.

There is also an ancient belief that 
the day is the only time ferns grow flowers and it is traditional to 
hunt for a fern flower, which is thought to bring knowledge, luck and 
wealth.

Some plants take on a special meaning during the holiday, particularly the fern which is supposed to bloom for a few moments during the night

Those celebrating the festival spend time searching for the fern flower which is meant to bring limitless knowledge, luck and wealth

Hundreds of people gather together in fields to celebrate the holiday which falls on July 7 each year

Ivan Kupala Day is celebrated in Russia, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine and Finland.

Initially, before the spread of Christianity the holiday was associated with the summer solstice around June 21.

But after the adoption of Christianity
it was moved to the birthday of John the Baptist, which is June 24 in 
the Old Style calendar still used by some Orthodox churches, but is July
7 on the widely-used Gregorian calendar.

Although the date has removed the 
holiday from its solstice origins people continue to carry out pagan 
rituals associated with water and fire on the day.

As well as leaping over the fire many swim in open water on Ivan Kupala Day as it is thought to bring good health

The holiday was moved from the summer solstice to John the Baptist's birthday with the rise of Christianity
