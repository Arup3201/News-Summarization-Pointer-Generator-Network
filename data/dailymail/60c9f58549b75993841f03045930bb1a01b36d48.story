The Iron Chicken, who lives off nuts and bolts and the Soup Dragon, who provides green soup from the soup wells will also appear.

The new series will use original creator Oliver Postgate’s technique of stop frame animation and be overseen by the BBC along with original producers Smallfilms.

Co-creator Peter Firmin, who founded Smallfirms with the late Oliver Postgate, will be executive producer along with Postgate’s son, Daniel, who will write storylines and scripts.

Firmin said: ‘We hope to engage and 
entertain children of all ages and their families, just as Oliver and I 
did all those years ago.

Daniel Postgate added: ‘I’ve always loved Clangers. It is my favourite Smallfilms show. In fact, it is my favourite children’s show of all time.

I was about five years old when it was made - just the right age.

The new Clangers is not something we’ve rushed into. It has been carefully considered. For me, this is a labour of love.

We are very fortunate to get the very best people collectively to work on it, and we are all very enthusiastic.’

CBeebies controller Kay Benbow said: ‘Nostalgia is a funny thing, and we always think very carefully about remakes or re-imaginings of classic children’s programmes.

The Clangers is a programme that has an enduring magic. The new proposition has been built firmly upon the joyful foundations of the original, and will be produced by a team of exceptional talent which includes the extraordinary Peter Firmin. 

We are terrifically excited to bring this out-of-this-world series to our CBeebies audience.’

The television creations of Oliver Postgate defined a generation children's viewing.

From
'saggy old cloth cat' Bagpuss, to classics such as Ivor The Engine, 
Pingwings, Noggin The Nog and of course The Clangers, Postgate's voice 
as narator was recognisable to children across Britain from 1957 
onwards.

For The Clangers Mr
Postgate, who died in 2008, wrote out every word of the script for the 
show, before re-interpreting it using a Swannee whistle.

The original dialogue 
was virtually un-recognisable, but Mr Postgate still incurred the wrath 
of BBC executives, when they correctly guessed that one of the lines in 
the show was 'Oh sod it, the bloody thing won't open'.

Mr
Postgate was born in Hendon, North West London.

His father was Raymond Postgate
and his mother was Daisy Lansbury. Mr Postgate is the cousin of 
Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and Murder She Wrote Actress Angela Lansbury 
and grandson of Labour politician George Lansbury.

During
the Second World War Mr Postgate became a conscientious objector, and 
served a sentence in jail. But he avoided serving his full sentence by 
agreeing to be a Red Cross stretcher-bearer, and later served in 
Germany.

The programmes 
were made using stop-motion animation techniques, setting up the 
Smallfilms company in a disused cowshed with artist and puppeteer Peter 
Firmin.

The Clangers in their 1970s heyday

The Clangers were described by Oliver Postgate as a family set in space.

Aunty Clanger, Granny Clanger and the gang  were small creatures living in peace and harmony on a small, hollow planet, far, far away.

To make the programme Mr Postgate and Mr Firmin used stop motion animation techniques, and while Firmin designed the creatures his wife knitted their Roman armour-style costumes.

During production, The Clangers grew in size from the first to the last episode, to allow Firmin to use an Action Man figure in an episode entitled The Rock Collector.

The sound effects for the programme were created by Mr Postgate, who wrote out a script before using a whistle to create the unique voices of the characters.
