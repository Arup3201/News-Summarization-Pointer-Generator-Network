Get your brollies ready because a bank holiday is coming and that can mean only one thing - rain.

That's the warning from forecasters today as the August break looks set to be a washout for some.

According to the Met Office, Britain's weather will get increasingly unsettled throughout this week as temperatures cool.

What to expect: Demi, nine, and Chelsea Brookes, 11, sit in the rain on Blackpool Beach. Forecasters say this is what's in store for the bank holiday weekend

And by the weekend some area in the 
north and west could see thunderstorms and rain moving in from the west -
however the outlook in the south and east is better with a far greater 
chance of some sun.

Last weekend's searing heat - which saw some areas hit 32C as Britain baked - won't be repeated as across the UK temperatures dip to the low 20s.

Met Office forecaster Emma Sharples said: 'As
we go through the week, Wednesday and Thursday will have a higher 
chance of a shower and then as we get to the weekend an area of low 
pressure in the west which will bring some showers, although there will also be sunshine.

'It is too early and too bold to say it will be a washout but we won't see temperatures as high as 
they got this weekend and it will be less humid, less clear and 
temperatures in the low to mid 20s.

'It will still feel fairly warm with 
temperatures nearer the average for the time of year.'

Most of the country has been enjoying a burst of glorious sunshine but the warm spell which has seen temperatures hotter than Greece and Barbados.

Britain baked: Crowds enjoying the searing temperatures on Brighton beach on Saturday. But don't expect the same weather on the bank holiday weekend, forecasters warn

The South and South-east sweltered as the mercury soared to the high 80s even hitting 32.4C

There was rain at the V Festival site at Weston Park, Staffordshire, yesterday and it could be repeated next weekend, forecasters have warned

The sun never came out in West Yorkshire yesterday, instead the region was swept by torrential showers of rain. Here it is raining in Centenary Square, Bradford

However, Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, warned the rest of the month is shaping up to be 'absolutely dreadful'.

He said: 'The South-east will hold on to the good weather probably until Wednesday and we will still see some good temperatures across the region.

'But low pressure is due to take over and things are going to really take a dive by the end of the week, and it is looking pretty horrific for the bank holiday – cold, windy and wet.

'Places that have seen the hot­test weather, particularly the East, are in line for some torrential downpours which could cause some flash flooding. It is a real washout for the last official period of summer.'

Parts of Britain enjoyed wall-to-wall sunshine and blue skies over the weekend, bringing millions to parks and beaches.

The South and South-east sweltered as the mercury soared to the high 80s even hitting 32.4C (90F) in Cavendish, Suffolk.

A high of 30.6C (87.1F) was reached in Cambridge, and 30C (86F) in London.

Sun-lovers flocked to the coast with roads heading into Dorset and the South-west busy from early morning.

But across the north, west and Wales,
temperatures were just 22C (72F) at best, although still above the 21C 
(70F) average for the time of year.

There
was surface water flooding in places, and a heavy band of rain over the
Midlands in the afternoon left the 150,000 attending the V Festival in 
Staffordshire drenched.
