The family of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson has won permission to continue his right-to-die campaign by appealing against a High Court ruling that went against him.

Mr Nicklinson, 58, died a week after he lost his legal bid to end his life with a doctor’s help.

The father-of-two had been refusing food and contracted pneumonia after he was left 'crestfallen' by the court’s decision.

Tony Nicklinson's wife Jane comforts him as he reacts to a statement revealing High Court judges decided not to allow him to ask a doctor to end his life on August 16, 2012. Mr Nicklinson suffered from locked-in syndrome after suffering a stroke

He died at his home in Melksham, Wiltshire, surrounded by family on August 22 last year.

The family vowed to continue Mr Nicklinson’s campaign, and today it was confirmed that the Court of Appeal has given permission for his widow Jane to bring an appeal against the High Court decision.

The appeal is being seen as an important test case on whether medical help can legally be provided to those seeking the right to die.

Mrs Nicklinson has said that continuing the legal battle is likely to involve a long campaign, fraught with legal technicalities, but the family sees it as 'part of Tony’s legacy, we’re fighting for him, on his behalf'.

Mr Nicklinson was a keen sportsman until he was paralysed by a stroke while on a business trip to Athens in 2005.

Three judges sitting at the High Court in London referred to his 'terrible predicament' and described his case as ‘deeply moving and tragic’.

But Lord Justice Toulson, Mr Justice Royce and Mrs Justice Macur unanimously agreed it would be wrong for the court to depart from the long-established legal position that 'voluntary euthanasia is murder, however understandable the motives may be.'

They said doctors and solicitors who encouraged or assisted another person to commit suicide were 'at real risk of prosecution'.

Refusing judicial review, the judges agreed that the current law did not breach human rights and it was for Parliament, not the courts, to decide whether it should be changed.

Appeal judges will now have to decide whether or not they agree with the High Court’s stance.

Mrs Nicklinson tweeted today: 'I have been granted the right to appeal the High Court decision that went against us. Good news indeed!'

Mr Nicklinson’s daughter Lauren said: 'We are absolutely delighted and it is a great start to the year.'It was a great surprise to hear the news.

'Our legal team is behind us and believes we have every chance of succeeding.'We hope that 2013 brings greater things for our campaign than 2012.'

But Campaign group Care Not Killing said the law, as upheld by the High Court, did not need changing or clarification.

Group spokeswoman Alistair Thompson said 'no one could fail to be moved' by Mr Nicklinson’s case, but added: 'The current law has been debated and voted on many times by parliamentarians, and as recently as last year.

'It exists to protect those who are sick, elderly, depressed or disabled from feeling obliged to end their lives.

'It protects those who have no voice against exploitation and coercion and acts as a powerful deterrent to would-be abusers. It does not need changing.'
