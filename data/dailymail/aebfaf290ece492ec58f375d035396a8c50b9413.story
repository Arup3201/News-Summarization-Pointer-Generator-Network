Sam Allardyce headed for his 60th birthday celebrations with West Ham occupying a Champions League place and the veteran manager admitting that he is too long in the tooth to fret over his Upton Park future.

When Allardyce was given a stay of execution by the club’s owners in May it was on the basis that he served up more attacking football.

Five months on and Big Sam has delivered with a little help from a summer signing who has scored six goals in six games. Now the manager is being asked about Sakho rather than the sack.

There is a long way to go, of course, but it is a sign of how quickly things can change that David Sullivan and David Gold are happy to let Allardyce’s contract drift towards its expiry date at the end of the season. Allardyce has seen it all before.

‘When you’ve got 13 years in the Premier League and 20 years in the manager’s job, the anxiety of contracts is not a great hardship,’ he said. ‘If there is a turn in fortunes, I’ve still done a fantastic job and life will move on.’

It is more than a decade since Allardyce demonstrated the pressures of football management by wearing a heart monitor on the touchline for a television documentary and five years since he had cardiac surgery to remove an arterial blockage. He is a changed man. ‘I don’t feel the pressure as much,’ he said.

‘You learn to deal with it. I’ve proved myself at this level a long time ago and that makes life all the more enjoyable and you can be less worried about things that go against you.’ West Ham proved that at Turf Moor, weathering a difficult first half against a Burnley side desperate for their first win of the season before scoring three second-half goals to move up to fourth place.

Diafra Sakho maintained his remarkable record since a £3.5million summer move from Metz and was involved in the other goals for Enner Valencia and Carlton Cole.

Allardyce bristles at the suggestion that West Ham’s style is significantly different this season, but the fans who wanted him out have certainly gone quiet.

This was the first time a Premier League team has scored with three headers in one game since Norwich managed it against Newcastle nearly three years ago.

Having won his fourth Premier League game in eight, Allardyce needed to overcome another challenge, this time from wife Lynn, before his birthday celebrations.

‘There was a big debate between us about whether it should be a large party,’ he revealed. ‘Not being that pleased about being 60, I said it would be small so it’s with very close personal friends.

‘Then on Sunday it’s all the family — son, daughter, the grandchildren. I’ll really have a very good weekend now.’

The same could not be said for Burnley after eight games without a win. George Boyd scored their goal but Burnley failed to make the most of their chances. ‘It’s devastating,’ said Boyd. ‘But I have no doubt we’ll get the goals which will be enough to keep us in the division.’
