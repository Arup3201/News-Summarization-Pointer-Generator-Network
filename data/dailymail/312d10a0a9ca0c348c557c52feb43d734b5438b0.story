Nemanja Vidic trained with his new Inter Milan team-mates on Tuesday following his move from Manchester United.

The Serie A side are at their training base - in the village of Appiano Gentile, near to Como - for the start of their pre-season training and the Serbian defender looked to have quickly settled in to his new surroundings.

He was officially unveiled as an Inter player on Friday after joining the club as a free agent following eight seasons at Old Trafford.

The 32-year-old centre-back has signed a three-year contract with the Nerazzurri and aimed to deliver the club the Scudetto for the first time since the 2009-2010 campaign.

'Inter is one of the top clubs in the world, with a great history and tradition,' he said at his first press conference.

'There was a new project in place and I immediately liked it.

'When Inter made an approach, there were many other clubs interested in me. I'm happy to be here.

'I know the president [Erick Thohir] has a long-term plan and he wants to keep Inter at a high level.'

Inter trained at the Centro Sportivo Angelo Moratti, their training base, for the final time on Tuesday before heading north to their Alpine training camp in Pinzolo.

They will play one warm-up match there before flying out to the United States for friendlies against Real Madrid on July 26, Manchester United on July 30 and Roma on August 2.
