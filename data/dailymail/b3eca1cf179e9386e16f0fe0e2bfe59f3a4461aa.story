Anthony Weiner's sexting partner Sydney Leathers really is milking every second of her 15 minutes of fame. On Monday, she publicly debuted a $40,000 plastic surgery makeover worthy of an X-rated movie star.

The 23-year-old Indiana native went under the knife last month, getting size-D breasts, liposuction on her flabby tummy, a nose job and teeth whitening.

She exclusively told MailOnline that she thinks married New York mayoral candidate Weiner, would love her new boobs, even though she previously said he was more of a foot fetish man.

Why? 'Because he's a pervert,' Leathers says.

Family man? Sydney Leathers said her former sexting pal Anthony Weiner, seen here with wife Huma Abedin, would 'secretly love' her new size-D breasts

Despite her seemingly made-for-porn makeover, she insisted she isn't going back to X-rated movies. She 
made headlines starring in XXX film Weiner and Me. Weeks later it was 
revealed that she was possibly exposed to HIV because she had 
unprotected sex with a male co-star who was at risk for the virus.

Leathers
 says the porno movie was a 'one-time thing,' but says she wouldn't do 
anything differently if she was handed her 15-minutes of fame again.

'I’m
 happy with my life I think I did the right things,' she said. 'I think 
it bothers people that I’m happy with myself and my life.'

Leathers
 also revealed her fame has made her a pretty penny. She wouldn't 
discuss the amount but said, 'It was way more than I thought it'd be - 
enough that I'm comfortable now.'

She hinted that a book about her relationship with Weiner might be on the cards.

She said she had wanted surgical 
enhancements even before she shot to fame with her revelations that she 
exchanged sexually-explicit messages with Weiner - months after 
resigned from Congress over a sexting scandal.

The
 married father-of-one had been a frontrunner to be the next 
mayor of New York City when Leathers' bombshell went public. A new poll 
reveals he is likely to win just  seven per cent support in this month's 
Democratic primary - second-to-last place.

Success: Leathers offered a 'thumbs up' as she regained consciousness in at the office of a New York plastic surgeon

Leathers would not say how much she had to pay for the $40,000 makeover - though she allowed cameras from Inside Edition to film the entire process

Sydney's nose: Dr Richard Westreich

Breast implants and liposuction: Dr Matthew Schulman

Sydney's dental work: Dr Shawn Sadri

Leathers said she had always wanted bigger breasts - she was naturally a size C - and to remove a bump on her nose.

'I just wanted to feel more comfortable in my own skin,' she says.

As
 for the liposuction - doctors removed five pounds of fat from her 
stomach and her sides - she says, 'Well, it just needed that.'

She
 says she's not done with her surgery yet - she'll need laser 
surgery on the scars on the underside of her breast where New York 
plastic surgeon Dr Matthew Shulman inserted the silicone implants. 

Leathers says Weiner always discouraged her whenever she talked him about getting a boob job.

'But I feel like secretly, he’d love it,' she said. 'Because he's a pervert.'

She wouldn't talk about how she paid for the surgeries, but a crew from Inside Edition exclusively filmed the transformation from start to finish and unveiled her new look today.

The entire package was valued at $40,000.

She says that the surgery 'wasn't a big deal', despite undergoing three procedures at once.

However, she conceded she didn't tell anyone in her family before she went under the knife - except her brother who was there for support.

Notice the difference? Leathers said the angioplasty she received left her with a 'cuter' nose. She is seen before the surgery, left, and after, right

Under the bright lights: Leathers chose to star in an XXX-movie before her plastic surgery

After: Sydney Leathers has had multiple surgeries done - including breast implants, liposuction, a nose job and dental work

She especially made sure to keep the news from her father.

'He always used to tell me, "You don’t need that stuff, you’re beautiful the way you are." Maybe I didn’t want him to talk me out of it,' she said.

Leathers says neither her fame nor her new body has her - despite plucking her from her home in southern Indiana.

'I'm the same, just with bigger boobs and a cuter nose now,' she said.

Her surgery is the latest in a long line of publicity stunts since she was revealed as Weiner's latest online mistress.

Following the HIV scare, the former political blogger became an advocate for safe sex. This came not long after she became an advocate for legalizing marijuana.

Leathers said last week she regrets having unprotected intercourse in her porn debut with an actor who days earlier slept with a star diagnosed as HIV positive.

The man who played Weiner, Xander Corvus, had previously had sex with Cameron Bay -  a porn actress whose recent HIV diagnosis brought the porn industry to an abrupt halt.

The chain of events sparked fears that Leathers may have been exposed to the virus.

Leathers said: 'I feel like it's my duty to stress the importance of using condoms.'

She went on to advise that condom use is important not just while making porn but if people were thinking about 'having a one night stand in real life'.

She added: 'Whether your partner is a porn star or not, you could be putting yourself at risk. You don't know who all they have been with.'
