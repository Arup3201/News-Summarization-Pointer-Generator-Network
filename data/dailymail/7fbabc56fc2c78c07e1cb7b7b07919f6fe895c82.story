A New Mexico mother is facing a hate crime charge after police say she physically and sexually abused her 17-year-old daughter because she is lesbian.

The Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office said 40-year-old Magdo Haro, of Las Cruces, was arrested Tuesday on charges of second-degree criminal sexual penetration and third-degree child abuse.

According to a criminal complaint, the 17-year-old girl told investigators she and Haro had been arguing about the girl’s sexual orientation for around a week.

Grave charges: Magdo Haro, 40, from New Mexico, is accused of forcing her daughter to undress and touch herself, threatening to violate her with a stick and hitting her with a shoe for being gay

The complaint obtained by Las Cruses Sun-News states Haro threatened to insert the stick of a plunger and a hanger inside her daughter ‘so she would know what it was like to have sex with a woman.’

The mother eventually coerced her daughter into performing lewd sexual acts on herself.

Magdo Haro was later released from Dona Ana County Jail on a $25,000 secured bond.

Police say the dispute between the mother and daughter started last Saturday.

According to the girl, who is not being named due to the nature of the crime, her mother was displeased seeing her in a baseball cap and allegedly ordered her daughter 'not to wear boy clothes anymore, only girl clothes.'

The suspect also told the teen she would have to start going to church with her grandmother, according to the court filing.

The young victim told investigators that things took a turn for the worse after Miss Haro found notes from the teen’s girlfriend.

The complaint states that before the discovery, Miss Haro had given her daughter three chances to prove she was not gay, KFOX14 reported.

The mother-daughter dispute culminated, according to court documents, with Haro forcing her daughter to take off her clothes so she could see that the teen was a woman and not a man, and then making the 17-year-old touch her privates.

The child told police she complied because she was afraid her mother would sexually assault her. Miss Haro has denied the allegations of physical and sexual abuse but admitted to striking the teen with a shoe.

Following Magdo Haro's arrest, her daughter was transferred into the custody of the Children, Youth and Families Department.

The hate crime charge against Haro means that she could face an additional year in prison if convicted of the abuse counts.
