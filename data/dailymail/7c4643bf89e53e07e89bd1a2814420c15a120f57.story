Mrs Miller says internet firms have a responsibility

Internet giants are to be told 'enough is enough' by ministers as they come under fire for failing to prevent a tide of pornographic and extremist material online.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller has summoned Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo and other firms to a Whitehall summit where they will be told to consider urgent measures to limit access to harmful material.

Government sources said they would include new filters to screen out ‘offensive and unlawful’ content, tighter controls on what is allowed on public wi-fi, and a new industry-wide protocol on how complaints are dealt with.

Phone companies, including Vodafone and O2, are also being asked to attend the talks because of the amount of harmful material being downloaded on mobiles.

The fresh call for action comes after Mark Bridger was given a life sentence for the murder of five-year-old April Jones last week. He had collected a ‘library’ of sickening images from the internet in the weeks before the abduction.

Concerns have also been raised over extremist material online in the wake of the Woolwich killing.

In a letter to Dan Cobley, UK managing director of Google, Mrs Miller said: ‘Recent horrific events have again highlighted the widespread public concern over the proliferation of, and easy access to, harmful content on the internet.

‘Whether these concerns focus on access to illegal pornographic content, the proliferation of extremist material which might incite racial or religious hatred, or the ongoing battle against online copyright theft, a common question emerges: what more can be done to prevent offensive online content potentially causing harm?

‘It is clear that dangerous, highly offensive, unlawful and illegal material is available through basic search functions and I believe that many popular search engines, websites and ISPs could do more to prevent the dissemination of such material.’

Measures to be discussed include an industry-wide protocol governing how they would respond to concerns around content when they arise and how they deal with complaints

The letter does not contain any threats of sanctions if the search engines fail to come up with an acceptable solution. But the Culture Secretary insisted that the fact the solutions were complex was ‘not an acceptable reason for the current situation to persist’.

‘Greater efforts need to be made to prevent the uploading, downloading and sharing of harmful material. Effective technological solutions have to be developed - and deployed -to minimise the harm done to businesses and consumers.’

Mrs Miller said Google played a ‘key role in terms of how individuals access online content - and has serious public responsibilities as a result of this position’.

‘A relatively small number of organisations wield a great deal of online power - and I believe that with that power comes a great responsibility. Given the grave concerns that have been raised it is right that we now consider what more could and should be done in this area,’ she added.

Google and the other firms - Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, BT, Virgin, Talk Talk, Vodafone, Sky, O2, EE, Three - have been asked to attend talks in Whitehall on June 18.

Measures to be discussed include an industry-wide protocol governing how they whould respond to concerns around content when they arise and how they deal with complaints.

Significant progress has been made on pornography filters but Mrs Miller wants them introduced to block other harmful content, and suggests an agreement on banning porn on public wi-fi available in coffee shops and other areas should be extended.

The industry will also be urged to form a group that meets regularly to focus on the issue.

On porn, the five main ISPs - BT, Everything Everywhere, Sky, TalkTalk, and Virgin Media - have made a commitment to offer filters to protect all devices in the home and will make selecting internet controls an ‘unavoidable step’ for new customers.

If customers choose not to engage - for example, if they just repeatedly click ‘yes’ to get through set-up quickly - then that would lead to protections being on rather than off.
