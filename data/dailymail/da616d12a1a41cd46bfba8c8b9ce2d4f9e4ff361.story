The suspected gunman who opened fire on the White House was charged Thursday with attempting to assassinate the President of the United States or his staff.

Idaho man Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, 21, was arrested at a Pennsylvania hotel after he shot an assault rifle at the White House believing that he was Jesus and President Barack Obama was the Antichrist, according to court documents and those who knew 
him.

At one point, he even suggested to an acquaintance the president was 
planning to implant computer tracking chips into children. Meanwhile, details have emerged about further items found in Ortega's car, which included a baseball bat and brass knuckles.

At his first appearance in court in Pennsylvania Thursday, Ortega sat 
quietly, his hands free but his feet shackled.

He said only, 'Yes, ma'am' when 
he was asked if he understood that he would be going back to Washington to face 
the charge.

Ortega is accused of firing nine rounds from an AK47 at the White House Friday night, cracking one one window close to the President's bedroom.

Police said that Ortega had become 'obsessed' with Obama and that God had given him a personal mission to attack the White House.

'He hates the president, he hates Washington, he hates society,' another official told the Washington Post.

Gunfire
 was heard between the White House and the Washington Monument on Friday
 evening. An abandoned car with an assault rifle with a scope and nine spent shell casings were later discovered by police inside.

The FBI have revealed the semi-automatic assault rifle was a Romanian Cugir SA.

Witnesses say Ortega owned that type of gun in Idaho and claim it went missing a couple of weeks ago when Ortega left.

According to the criminal complaint, police also recovered three loaded magazines and several boxes of cartridges from the car.

They also seized an aluminum baseball
 bat, brass knuckles and a sales receipt for purchases made at a WalMart
 in Fairfax, Virginia, just four-and-a-half-hours before the shooting.

Police believe that the gunman opened fire across a lawn from half a mile away around 9:30pm then ran off.

When
 the White House was checked Tuesday, a bullet was found to have smashed through
 a window.

It was only stopped from going inside the White House by the bulletproof 
glass interior layer behind it. A second round was found outside.

Authorities
 are investigating Ortega's mental health and say there are indications 
he believed his attack on the White House was part of a 'personal 
mission from God', according to a law enforcement official.

A U.S. Park Police bulletin said he was 'unstable with violent tendencies'.

Mr and Mrs Obama were not in the White House at the time, instead en route to the APEC summit in Hawaii over the weekend.

The White House has not said whether the Obamas' daughters, Sasha and Malia, 
were there at the time or commented on the shooting.

The window damaged is in front of the so-called Yellow Oval Room, according to the White House website.

The
 room is in the middle of the family's living quarters on the floor that
 includes the president's bedroom and the Lincoln Bedroom.

Ortega's mother has said he has no history of mental illness, though when 
authorities were looking for him they reported he did have 'mental health issues.'

In Idaho Falls, where Ortega is from, a computer consultant 
told The Associated Press that the two met July 8th after Ortega asked for help 
editing a 30-minute infomercial.

Monte McCall said that during the meeting at 
Ortega's family's Mexican restaurant, Ortega pulled out worn sheets of yellow 
paper with handwritten notes and started to talk about his predictions that the 
world would end in 2012.

'He said, `Well, you know the president is getting ready to 
make an announcement that they're going to put GPS chips in all the children, so 
they're safe,'' Mr McCall recalled of Ortega.

'... And then he said, `That's just what the 
Antichrist is going to do to mark everybody.''

Kimberly Allen, the mother of Ortega's former fiancee, said 
he had been well-mannered and kind in the four years she had known him. But he 
recently began making statements to her daughter that were out of character, 
including that he believed he was Jesus.

Ms Allen said the family was worried when 
he went to Utah recently, where he said he had business, and didn't come back. 
Ortega's family reported him missing October 31st.

The
 Secret Service said Ortega had been in 
Washington for weeks before opening fire, coming back and forth to 
the Washington Mall.

Ms Allen said they were flabbergasted to hear he was wanted in 
Washington.

'I believe that the boy needs help,' said Ms Allen, of Shelley, 
Idaho.

Agents said he is unpredictable and were extremely worried what he might do next.

They were also unsure if he is capable of launching a more sophisticated attack.

U.S. Park Police have in addition claimed he had a ‘direction of interest’ towards the President or the White House.

Ortega was questioned by police on Friday morning, before 
the shootings, just across the Potomac River from Washington in Arlington, Va. 
Police said they stopped him after a report of suspicious behavior, but let him 
go after photographing him because they had no reason to make an arrest.

Ortega has an arrest record in three states but has not been 
linked to any radical organizations, U.S. Park Police have said.

His criminal record ranges from domestic violence, drug charges, and assaulting a police officer.

U.S.
 Park Police said that before the shooting Ortega had been spending time with the Occupy 
D.C. protesters.

Police were called by his western Pennsylvania 
hotel after a desk clerk there recognized him and called police, leading to his arrest.

The Secret Service, Park Police, FBI, and Washington police had thought he was still in the area at the time.

Meanwhile, the President was busy meeting U.S. Marines and Australian troops at RAAF Base Darwin in Australia.

Signaling a determination to counter a rising China, President Barack Obama vowed Thursday to expand U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region and 'project power and deter threats to peace' in that part of the world even as he reduces defense spending and winds down two wars.

'The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay,' he declared in a speech to the Australian Parliament, sending an unmistakable message to Beijing.

If convicted, Ortega faces up to life in prison.
