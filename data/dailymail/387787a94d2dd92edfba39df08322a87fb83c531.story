Members of the notorious Brothers 4 Life gang will face court next month over a range of shooting charges.

NSW detectives last week arrested Nazir Akbari, 28, who is accused of shooting a man, 30, and a woman, 22, who were in a car parked outside a Wentworthville swimming pool, in Sydney's far west, in July 2013.

One of the shots hit the driver's door and grazed the man's leg, police allege

Akbari, who is already in jail on other matters, was charged with discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, among other charges.

An alleged supporter of the Brothers For Life gang holds his fingers up as he leaves Burwood Local Court on Monday July 14 after one member of the gang's Blacktown, Sydney chapter appeared on a charge of the attempted shooting of a man in Sydney's west in July last year.

NSW Police made dawn raids and swooped on addresses in western Sydney following a series of shootings and gun crimes, placing several men in custody. A 28-year-old man was charged at Long Bay Correctional Centre last week and appeared briefly in Burwood Court on Monday, July 14 after which the men (pictured) left the court, allegedly supporters of the accused

His shooting matter was briefly mentioned in Burwood Local Court and he will reappear before the same court on August 25. He did not appear via video link.

Six other members of the Brothers 4 Life Blacktown chapter were also charged on Monday with new offences over a home invasion in October 2013.

Police allege the gang forced their way into a home in Castlereagh, in Sydney's greater west, threatened a man in his bedroom, shot his dog and fired several shots into the floor.

The 26-year-old victim escaped and the dog recovered from its injuries.
