Sophie Taylor became the third English teenager to win a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games pool here in Glasgow, pulling off an upset to take victory in the 100 metres breaststroke.

The 18-year-old, born in Sheffield and based in Leeds, has been Leeds’s young sportswoman of the year for the past two years, but she put herself on the national map last night by storming home in a time of 1min 6.35sec ahead of Lorna Tonks of Australia and Jamaica’s Alia Atkinson.

Atkinson looked in control of the race until the Briton next to her sensed a weakness on the home straight.

‘I could see Alia next to me and could see that she was dying,’ Taylor said. ‘I just gave it my all.’

Earlier in this meeting, Taylor’s fellow English teens Ben Proud (in the 50m butterfly) and Adam Peaty (in the 100m breaststroke) took gold for England to inject some optimism into a British swimming revival at Olympic level.

Peaty won another medal to add to this Games haul last night, taking silver in the 50m breaststroke behind Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa — the reigning Olympic 100m champion Peaty defeated a few days ago over that distance.

England’s Fran Halsall finished out of the medals in the 100m freestyle final, but compatriot Aimee Willmott won silver in the 200m fly and Adam Barrett won 100m fly bronze behind South African winner Chad le Clos.

Taylor’s stated ambition is to compete at the Rio Olympics, where she would like to face one of her heroes, the Plymouth-based Lithuanian Olympic 100m champion Ruta Meilutyte, still only 17 herself.

Among the things they have in common is a shared respect for Meilutyte’s coach Jon Rudd, who oversaw a pre-Commonwealth Games camp for the England team at the London Olympic pool.
