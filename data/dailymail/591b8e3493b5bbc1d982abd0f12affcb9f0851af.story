A pensioner has been fined for leaving out tuna laced with antifreeze after five of his neighbours’ cats died.

Donald Waterworth, 79, was spotted hiding the mixture in his garden by a woman whose pet had died a ‘horrific’ death a few months earlier.

He admitted knowingly putting down poison and was fined £125 – however it could not be proved he killed the animals.

Pensioner Donald Waterworth, pictured at his home,  admitted placing tuna laced with anti-freeze in his back garden. The investigation was sparked by the death of  five cats nearby

His next-door-neighbour Julie 
McClumpha, 55, lost her beloved eight-year-old cat Treacle in October 
last year. Meanwhile Linsey Bilsborough, 45, lost four cats – named 
Tippex, Affro, Midnight and Lily – after they all became seriously ill 
around the same time.

Both 
women reported that their pets became unwell suddenly and appeared in 
pain. Vets suspected they had consumed a noxious substance and a sample 
taken from Midnight’s bladder confirmed the presence of antifreeze.

Mrs
 McClumpha then spotted Waterworth creeping around outside his house in 
Leyland, Lancashire, with a torch in March this year.

She
 said: ‘I thought it was strange because he had a security light and it 
wasn’t on. I went upstairs and went into the room that overlooks his 
garden and watched him.

‘I could only see his left arm and he was moving as you would if you were stirring something up.’

Lily, top left, and Midnight, bottom left as well as Treacle also died after they  ingesting the poisoned food 

After
 seeing him place a dish behind a storage box in his garden, she 
contacted Miss Bilsborough and they retrieved it. Tests found it 
contained tuna and antifreeze.

She added: ‘Treacle had gone through the most horrific death – I wouldn’t like anybody to have to witness it. It was awful.’

Miss Bilsborough, who is mother to Jude, 17, and Rowen, nine, said: ‘I couldn’t believe he would do something like that.

‘I
 think that’s what has upset me more because I thought we were friends. 
When my cats died I even went around to warn him and he said to me how 
awful it was.

‘We’ve 
suffered so much as a family and my boys are still often in tears about 
it. I’ll never understand how someone could do that. To smile to your 
face and do that behind your back is disgusting.’

Preston
 Magistrates’ Court heard Waterworth initially denied the charge but 
later pleaded guilty by letter.  He did not attend the hearing on 
Thursday but was ordered to pay the fine, a victim surcharge of £20 and 
costs of £1,665.

Jonathan 
Fail, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: ‘We understand there would have 
been very significant suffering on behalf of the cats.’

Speaking after the hearing, Miss Bilsborough described the fine as being ‘far too lenient’.

Mrs McClumpha added: ‘It’s not going to bring my cat back, it’s  not going to undo what he’s done.’

Waterworth could not be contacted for comment.

RSPCA
 inspector Ian Robertson advised people concerned their cats may have 
been poisoned to take them to a vet immediately and if possible bring a 
sample of what they have consumed.
