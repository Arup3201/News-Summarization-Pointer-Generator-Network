Killed: John Cadwallader, 82, pictured, died after his ride-on lawnmower fell into a ditch trapping him underneath it

A retired businessman was killed when his sit-on lawnmower plunged into a ditch and trapped him underneath.

John Russell Cadwallader, 82, was cutting a lawn in Oswestry, Shropshire, when his vehicle toppled into the ditch, an inquest heard.

Mr Cadwallader was doing the garden work for his son, who was renovating the property, when the accident happened on May 6.

Shrewsbury Coroners' Court heard how his wife Gwyneth, 72, drove to the house after her husband didn't come home. She found him trapped underneath the lawnmower.

She said: 'When he failed to arrive home I drove out to my son's house and found him. I thought he had been knocked out.' 

Philip Tyler, a coroner's officer for Shropshire, told the hearing police were called to the accident and 'found the deceased underneath an upside-down lawnmower in a ditch'.

He said: 'Paramedics attended the scene and pronounced life extinct at 7.34pm. Police were satisfied there was nothing untoward and listed the death as non-suspicious.

'A post-mortem revealed that the deceased died from asphyxiation.'

The hearing returned a verdict of accidental death. 

In a family statement released after his death, Mr Cadwallader's sons John, 51, and David, 48, said: 'This has been a sad loss to the whole family and he leaves behind his wife, two sons and daughter-in-laws and three grandsons.

'He will be sadly missed by all and everyone that knew him.'

Mr Cadwallader - who was known as Russell - ran one of the largest privately-owned haulage companies in the UK.

At its peak G&R Cadwallader ran 106 trucks and 200 trailers which moved fresh and frozen food throughout Europe in the 1960s.

He retired from the refrigerated transport pioneer in 1996 and his sons John and David then opened Cadwallader Limited.

The company - which is still running today - sells new and used refrigerated trailers, box vans and curtain-siders.
