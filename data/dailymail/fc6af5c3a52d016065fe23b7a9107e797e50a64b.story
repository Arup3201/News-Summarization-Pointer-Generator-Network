A man died after he dived into the path of a Tube train to try to save his younger brother who had jumped on to the tracks.

Nick Mann, 35, was killed as he attempted to rescue Robert, 32, who is believed to have dropped his mobile or wallet on to the line at Old Street station in London.

He tried to pull his brother to safety but suffered severe head injuries when a Northern line train ploughed into them both.

The pair were taken to the Royal London Hospital where Nick, a writer from Wimbledon, died.

Robert, who lives in Manchester, was yesterday in a stable but critical condition.

Hours before the tragedy – just after midnight on Saturday night – Nick took a selfie with his brother at Fratton Park in Portsmouth where they had gone to watch their favourite football team Shrewsbury play the home team.

 Friends yesterday paid tribute to former Manchester University student Nick, who they said ‘would have done anything for anyone’.

One friend, who did not want to be named, told the Evening Standard: ‘The fact that Nick passed away while saving his brother is the least surprising thing in all of this.

Ambulance on the scene: Police  said that on arrival officers discovered two men with serious injuries

‘He had all the time in the world for anyone, and gave so much to everything he had passion for. He loved two things in equal measure – music and football. He was one of the most passionate people I’ve ever known. He was a great dude.’

Josh Retallick, who had known Nick for eight years, said: ‘It was such a heroic act. I just hope his brother recovers.’

Eyewitnesses said the pair were hit by a train as Nick – who ran a rock music fanzine – desperately tried to pull his younger brother, who studied history at Manchester Metropolitan University, on to the platform.

A Tube worker said: ‘The man dropped something down on to the track, a mobile phone or something, and then somehow he’s got into trouble down there.

‘This other person then tried to help him out and pull him up back on to the platform in time before the train came, but it wasn’t in time and they both got hit. It was pretty bad.’

Another said: ‘It happened at the back of the platform, just as the train pulls in, so maybe they didn’t realise how close the train was.’

British Transport Police described the incident as a ‘tragic accident’.
