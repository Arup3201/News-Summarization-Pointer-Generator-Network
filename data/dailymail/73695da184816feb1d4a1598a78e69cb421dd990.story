Madonna's ex-boyfriend has swapped the queen of pop for the first lady of France.

In scenes which will infuriate the 55-year-old singer, Brahim Zaibat danced with Valerie Trierweiler at the Elysee Palace in Paris.

Ms Trierweiler is the partner of French President Francois Hollande, but made a bee-line for Zaibat, 25, at her official Christmas Party on Wednesday.

He's got a type: Brahim Zaibat grabbed hold of Valerie Trierweiler, the girlfriend of President Francois Hollande, at a Christmas party in the Elysee

Wearing a figure-hugging party dress and a big smile, 48-year-old Ms Trierweiler looked delighted as she clung hold of the young backing dancer.

After their performance on the dance floor, Brahim gave his partner a big kiss before an irritated looking Mr Hollande shuffled towards the pair.

‘It was frankly all a bit awkward,’ said one Elysee Palace source. ‘The President’s consort is not meant to dance with younger men in public view.’

Soon afterwards, Brahim tweeted pictures and even a video of his triumphant dance – making sure that Madonna would see it.

Madonna and Brahim were together for three years and at one stage looked as though they might marry.

But the relationship ‘ran its course’, said a source close to the singer, adding: ‘They were dancing and working together all the time and then they barely saw each other.’

Brahim, who was a backup dancer on Madonna's MDNA world tour, is currently competing on the French version of ‘Dancing With the Stars’.

This has enabled him to build up his own fan base in his own country,  and he is now a household name in France in his own right.

Causing a scandal: French President Francois Hollande, 59, was still living with his ex-partner when he began an affair with Ms Trierweiler, 48, a political journalist

However, he still longs for international stardom, especially in countries like Britain and America.

Ms Trierweiler has became an extremely controversial character since moving into the Elysee last year.

She has fallen out with Segolene Royal, the mother of Mr Hollande’s four children, none of whom speak to Ms Trierweiler any more.

Last year it emerged that Ms Trierweiler had been having an affair with Mr Hollande while he still lived with Ms Royal, and she was at one stage sharing the Socialist politician with a conservative lover.

As Ms Trierweiler’s approval ratings plunged, many argued that taxpayers’ money should not be used to fund her lavish lifestyle at the Elysee.
