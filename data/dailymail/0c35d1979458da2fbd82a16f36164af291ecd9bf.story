Even as more Republican politicians are coming out in support of gay marriage, there are some in the party who still refuse to change even in spite of close connections to the cause.

Republican congressman Matt Salmon from Arizona said that even though his son is gay, he refuses to support same-sex marriage, saying that he's 'just not there'.

'As far as believing in my heart that we should change 2000 years of social policy in favor of a redefinition of the family. I'm not there,' Congressman Salmon said.

'My son is by far one of the most important people in my life, I love him more than I could say,' he told local station 3TV News.

'I don’t believe that this is a lifestyle that he chose.

'It doesn't mean that I don’t have respect. It doesn't mean that I don’t sympathize with some of the issues, it just means that I haven't evolved to that station. Rob Portman apparently has.'

The congressman's son, who is also named Matt Salmon, has been out and proud for a number of years, and told a Phoenix paper that he told his mother that he was gay when he was 14-years-old.

His parents' anti-gay stance has not stopped the younger Matt Salmon from making his own way in state politics, becoming the president of the Arizona Log Cabin Republicans and posing for a photo shoot with his boyfriend for the Phoenix New Times.

Adding to the complicated situation in the Salmon family is the fact that they are all devout Mormons, a faith that bans homosexuality.

At the time of the interview in 2010, Matt was dating Kent Flake, who also has family connections to Republican politicians in the state, and the pair both decided to leave the church because of their conflicts with their sexuality.

They received frosty welcomes from their families, who were not thrilled by the coupling.

'Everybody's pretty much told me, "You're fine, we love you, but your partner's not welcome because we don't want gay around us." And I'm like, "Well, I am gay. What if he doesn't act gay? Is that okay? Can he come around?"' Matt told the paper.

In today's Washington Post article, the younger Matt tells how he and his father have a strong relationship but recognize their differences when it comes to homosexuality.

'I love my father and realize that he can have the opinions that he has, and they might differ from mine, but that doesn’t change the way I feel about him,' he said.

'I definitely share my feelings, but I don’t pressure him to change his opinion because I know that given our relationship there’s no real need to do that. We each know where we stand.'

Congressman Salmon's stance comes in stark contrast to that of Senator Rob Portman, who made waves after switching his personal stance from being firmly anti-gay rights to in support of same-sex marriage after learning that his son is gay.
