Exactly three years ago, the Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia crashed into rocks off the island of Giglio, killing 32 people.

The ship was only removed from the rocky outcrop near the Tuscany island after a two-year salvage operation.

But while the cruise industry has since introduced new safety regulations, nearly a third of holidaymakers still believe ships are only built for show, rather than safety.  

On January 13, 2012, the Italian cruise ship, Costa Concordia, capsized off the coast of Tuscany

Unsurprisingly, in the weeks following the event, many travellers were deterred from cruising, which sending bookings plummeting by 26 per cent.

Since then, almost one-third (29 per cent) of respondents polled still believe that modern ships are built mostly to impress, not for safety.

A further 13 per cent of respondents admit to finding safety demonstrations on ships confusing, while 8 per cent reveal that they tend not to pay attention to safety demonstrations at all.

However, another 39 per cent now believe that safety is top priority on board - especially in light of the introduction of 10 new safety procedures following the tragic ordeal, according to research carried out by cruise.co.uk.

In the months following the sinking, new safety procedures for cruise travel have been implemented

Bookings initially dropped by 26% following the accident and 29% still believe ships are built only to impress

New policies from The Cruise Lines International Association include advanced muster drills, which detail each passenger's designated safety station and instruct on how to fit a life jacket, as well as the harmonisation of bridge procedures.

Seventy three percent of survey respondents said that they felt that safety standards have significantly enhanced over the last three years with a whopping 71 per cent even going so far as to say that they believe cruising to be a much safer means of travel than by plane.

This may be, in part, attributed to the recent Air Asia and Malaysia Airlines tragedies. 

All respondents also claim that reports of freak accidents do not deter them from boarding a cruise ship. 

However, a shift in attitudes is evident - 39% of Cruise.co.uk survey respondents believe safety is top concern

Interestingly,all polled revealed that these freak accidents do not deter them from boarding luxury liners

Seamus Conlon, Managing Director of Cruise.co.uk, comments: 'The sinking of the Costa Concordia was undoubtedly one of the most tragic and avoidable incidents in the cruise industry over the past decade, and it's a hugely important day to commemorate. 

'As our survey shows, despite this tragedy, British cruisers subsequently have greater confidence when travelling and this is due to the commendable safety standards that are rife within our industry. 

'The Costa Concordia is an important reminder that safety is the primary concern for cruise liners, and we're confident these standards will only continue to increase over the next decade.'
