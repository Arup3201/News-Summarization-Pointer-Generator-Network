After nearly 400 years of symbolising four nations united in one flag, what would the Union Flag look like without the blue and white of the Saltire?

The question is being posed by flag experts after a poll found nearly 65 per cent were in favour of changing the flag if Scotland votes Yes to independence.

The vexillologists, as they are known, have come up with designs that could replace the familiar red, white and blue flag.

The first design strips out the blue field of the Scottish flag, replacing it with black, and sees the white bands turn a shade of yellow - intended to honour the flag of Wales' patron saint, St David (a yellow cross on a black field)

This version removes the white of St Andrew's saltire and imposes a crown and Royal Standard - including England's three lions, the red Scottish lion and the harp, a national symbol of Wales as well as Ireland

Most have removed any trace of Scottish blue, instead bringing in colours symbolic of Wales – both the striking yellow and black from the flag of St David and the red dragon from the Welsh national flag.

But some designs retain elements of Scotland, such as the red Scottish lion or the thistle, which could be justified if the Queen remains head of state following independence, as Alex Salmond has stated.

The yellow fimbriation is simply adding the gold cross of the Welsh St David flag to the existing union flag

All traces of Scottish blue are removed, with the green from the Welsh national flag fused into the bottom half, leaving the crosses of St George and St Patrick

Last month, the College of Arms said the Union Flag would not be affected by the referendum because the Queen would remain the head of state.

But the Flag Institute, the UK charity that advises on flags, has raised the question of a new flag for a Great Britain without Scotland. In a poll, 72 per cent wanted Wales to be represented in the design.

A more modern interpretation of the design, including the colours of St David's flag and retaining the Scottish blue - to reflect the fact that Scotland would continue to share the British monarchy

This design removes the Scottish elements from the flag entirely, and adds the Royal Coat of Arms, surrounded by a garland of items symbolic of the Commonwealth nations

The red cross of St George and blue and white Saltire of St Andrew merged in 1606, with a redesign to incorporate the Irish cross of St Patrick in 1801.

Flag Institute chief executive Charles Ashburner said: ‘There is already a precedent for changing the flag.’

All traces of Scottish blue are removed, with the green from the Welsh national flag fused into the bottom half , leaving the crosses of St George and St Patrick.

The Union Flag keeps its shape but in comes a stark black background. The Scottish influence, denoted by the blue of the Saltire, is no longer welcome.

A complete redesign, with no trace of Scotland in the new British symbol but with the flags of England, Wales and Northern Ireland all squashed together in a row.

Two of the quadrants are filled with the St George cross and one of the Welsh flag. But in the bottom left hand corner, the St Patrick's cross is replaced the colours of the flag of Ulster

Here, the flags of England, Wales and Northern Ireland are squashed in a row, with no trace of the Scots flag

Again, all trace of the Scottish saltire has gone, leaving the red cross of St George, the red saltire of St Patrick plus the Welsh flag stuck on the bottom right hand corner

The blue of Scotland is replaced with black, and the national plants of the UK – a rose, a daffodil and a shamrock – are added, plus a thistle for Scots who vote No.

It is a standard design in royal banners to quarter the flags and have different designs in each quadrant. The Welsh national flag is prominent but England’s appears twice.

The minimal change option, with the blue of the Scottish Saltire retained but with a little yellow added to the cross to incorporate a symbol of Wales.

Keeping the traditonal design in mind, this version swaps the Scots blue for a plain black from flag of St David

The more detailed design adds the national plants of the UK a rose, a daffodil, and a shamrock. Though the Scots blue has been replaced with the yellow and black of the Welsh flag of St David, there is still room for a thistle to represent those Scots who intend to vote no

All Scottish elements are removed, with blue changed to black and the addition of the Royal Coat of arms and a garland of items symbolic of the Commonwealth.

Scotland is removed completely, leaving the crosses of St George and St Patrick, but with the addition of the Welsh dragon. Does it give Wales too much prominence?

The blue and white of the Saltire are replaced by yellow and black to represent the flag of St David, patron saint of Wales. This gives the flag a Germanic feel.

This funky redesign of the Union Flag remains inclusive, finding room for the blue from the Scottish Saltire and also the yellow and black of the flag of St David representing  Wales.

The white of the Saltire is removed, while the main centre panel incorporates the Crown and Royal Standard with England’s three lions, a Welsh harp and the Scottish lion.
