Sweeney Todd has been one of the biggest shows in the West End since opening last autumn.

And on Sunday night, Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton were crowned king and queen of musical theatre when they picked up the top prizes at the Olivier Awards.

Michael was named Best Actor In A Musical for his performance as the demon barber, while his co-star Imelda was named Best Actress In A Musical for her role as Mrs Lovett.

'My Cathie, I'm sharing this with you.'

Honoured: Dame Helen's co-star Richard McCabe won Best Actor In A Supporting Role

Dame Helen Mirren won Best Actress for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II in The Audience.

Speaking backstage, she said the award didn't mean she was 'the best': 'It really doesn't mean that, because 
there are so many incredible performances out there, including many that
 weren't even nominated.

'I was making a joke about the Queen winning, but it is a reflection of the kind of respect the Queen is held in.'

The
 National Theatre production saw its leading man Luke Treadaway beat the
 likes of James McAvoy, Mark Rylane, Rafe Spall and Rupert Everett to 
the coveted Best Actor trophy.

Luke accepted his award from Sex And The City star Kim Cattrall, saying: 'I love doing it so much anyway, my mind has been blown, I'm so happy.'

He said the a lot of the play's success was down to the original novel by Mark Haddon, from which it was adapted.

Luke said: 'I think it's a beautiful book about family and about love, about
 differences and people trying to cope with situations they find 
themselves in that are hard.'
