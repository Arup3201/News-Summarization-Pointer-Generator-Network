A guitar collector has had $30,000 worth of guitars signed by some of the world's biggest rock legends stolen from his back shed.

Fourteen celebrity autographed guitars were stolen some time between Thursday night and Tuesday morning from the collector's shed on Berrimilla Street, Manly West in Queensland.

It is believed that the guitars signed by some of the best musicians in the world had a cumulative value of about $30,000.

Queensland Police are seeking public assistance to locate the collector items signed by some of the best musical acts of the 80s and 90s.

It has not been clarified by police if the instruments were electric or acoustic guitars or if they have any leads on the case.
