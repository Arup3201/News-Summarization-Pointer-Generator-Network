The National Science Foundation awarded a grant of nearly $700,000 in 2010 to a New York City theater company so it could write and produce a play about climate change.

'The play uses real places and stories drawn from interviews conducted by the artists to create an experience that is part investigative journalism and part inventive theater,' according to the grant's online description.

'Attendance at the performances is projected to be about 75,000.'

'The initiative ... intends to create and evaluate a new model for how theater can increase 
public awareness, knowledge, and engagement with important 
science-related societal issues,' according to the government bureaucrats who awarded the funds.

'The Great Immensity' opens in April, bringing a month of toe-tapping cynicism and sanctimony to a theater nowhere near Broadway

Climate change remains a major focus of the Obama administration, with the president discussing it Wednesday during a meeting with European Commission President Jose-Manuel Barroso (L) and European Council President Herman van Rompuy

'The Great Immensity,' a play scheduled for an April 11 premiere in Brooklyn, is about a woman who hunts for a friend who disappeared from a tropical island. As she moves from place to place, she 'uncovers a mysterious plot surrounding the upcoming international climate summit,' reads an online plot summary.

The National Science Foundation's online grants directory lists more awards for theater-related projects, including a $900,000 outlay for a 'live performance simulation system' called 'Virtual Vaudeville.'

The theater company producing 'The Great Immensity' is The Civilians, a Brooklyn fixture whose artistic director Steve Crosson wrote and directs the play.

Crosson received a 'social justice' award in 2013 from Dartmouth College, his alma mater. In an avant-garde snub, however, he didn't show up to receive it.

The show's first musical number, called 'Margin of Error,' recounts global-warming poll numbers that the producers say 'were all reported by the New York Times.'

'Forty-four per cent' of Americans 'think that it should be more of a priority, but not if it costs too much, and less than health care or the economy,' reads one lyric. 'Thirty-six per cent think it's caused by humans – or maybe 47 per cent – or 51 per cent, maybe, think it's a combination of human and natural causes.'

The song's one laugh line: 'Ten per cent believe the snow they shoveled last winter precludes any chance of climate change.'

Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Science Committee, mocked the National Science Foundation on Wednesday for underwriting questionable projects with taxpayer dollars, and never explaining why

White House science czar John Holdren agreed that the National Science Foundation should be more 'transparent,' but wouldn't comment on the musical theater project or any other unusual grant awards

During a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday, House Science Committee chair Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, quizzed White House 'science czar' John Holdren over the National Science Foundation's failure to explain the scientific value of a series of 'questionable' grants.

In addition to the New York theater project, Smith pointed to a $340,000 grant 'to study the ecological consequences of early human-set fires in New Zealand,' a $50,000 survey of 'archived lawsuits in Peru from 1600-1700' and  a $20,000 expenditure of taxpayer money to study the '[c]auses of stress in Bolivia.'

In a written opening statement, Holdren said that '[a]s past budgets from this Administration did, the President’s 2015 Budget proposes to invest intelligently in research, innovation, education, and infrastructure to lay the foundations for the industries, jobs, workforce, and environmental and national-security benefits of tomorrow.'

'But,of course, we need the continued support of the Congress to get it done.'

Holdren declined to comment during the hearing on any of the specific grants Smith mentioned.

Smith said Thursday that the Obama administration 'has not been as open and honest with the American people as it should' in its quest to reverse what it says is an earth-changing period of global warming.

'When the [Science] Committee asked the EPA for the scientific data being used to justify some of the costliest regulations in history, their response was that they didn’t have it even though they were using it.'

Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore put climate change on the federal government's radar, back when it was called 'global warming' -- and won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for it
