The University of Alabama's president says she's making changes to the sorority system after it was revealed last week that the Greek organizations are racially segregated. 

Acknowledging that the student groups practiced blatant discrimination, University President Judy Bonner ordered the school's 18 all-white sororities to reopen recruitment, which ended in August, and begin accepting new members.

'While we will not tell any group who they must [accept], the University of Alabama will not tolerate discrimination of any kind,' Bonner said in a video statement posted to the university's website.

About 400 students and faculty members of the University of Alabama march across the campus to oppose racial segregation among its Greek-letter social organizations

She said the sororities should expand to include up to 360 members in order to make room for new members.

Bonner's order comes after the university's student newspaper, The Crimson White, reported last week that all-white sororities had blocked chapters from adding two black students as new members in August. 

One of the students matched all the typical requirements for sorority members: She had a 4.3 grade point average, was a salutatorian in her high school graduating class and came from a well-connected family.

Several hundred students marched at the university on Wednesday in protest of the discrimination.

The marchers began the demonstration near the university library and ended up gathering on the steps of the administration building, where Bonner's office is located. They held a large banner that said 'The final stand in the schoolhouse door.'

In her video statement, Bonner said 
the nation is watching the University of Alabama just as it did 50 years
ago, when it admitted its first black students. 

'Today
the eyes of the nation our once again on the University of Alabama,' 
she said. 'This time it is because our Greek system remains segregated 
and chapter members admit that during the recruitment process that ended
a few weeks ago decisions were made based on race.'

'The University of Alabama has made so much progress, but clearly we have so much further to go,' Bonner added.

Bonner's mandate on recruitment applies 
to 18 white sororities in the Alabama Panhellenic Association, the 
campus arm of the National Panhellenic Conference.

Yardena Wolf of Corvallis, Oregon, a 19-year-old sophomore at Alabama and a member of Alpha Omicron Pi, told the Associated Press that she moved out of her sorority house after facing backlash for speaking out against the decision not to offer membership to black women. 

'Rush was really, really hard to go through living in the house. We obviously didn’t pledge an African-American girl like I thought we would. It was really frustrating, and I faced some difficulties in my room and my house, so I just thought it would be better if I moved out,' Wolf told the Associated Press.
