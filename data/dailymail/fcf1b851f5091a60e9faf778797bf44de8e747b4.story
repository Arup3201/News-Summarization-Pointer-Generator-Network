House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers made no attempt to hide his disdain for NSA leaker Edward Snowden on Tuesday at a meeting in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening in London.

Rogers told his Members of Parliament that Snowden is a 'traitor' and is likely responsible for the deaths of both British and U.S. soldiers.

'The [US] government has pressed charges on Mr. Snowden. We are treating him, as I would argue, the traitor that he is,' Rogers said, according to the Huffington Post. 

'And by the way, and this is important, I would charge him for murder,' Rogers added. 

Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden poses for a photo during an interview in an undisclosed location in December 2013 in Moscow, Russia. Snowden has been living in Moscow since June 2012 after getting temporary asylum in order to evade prosecution by authorities in the U.S.

The Huffington Post says Rogers, a Republican who represents Michigan in Congress, made the remarks at an event hosted by a conservative think tank called the Henry Jackson Society.

The meeting for British MPs and foreign policy professionals was co-hosted by conservative MP Julian Lewis, who is a member of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee.

It's unclear from the Huffington Post's article what triggered Rogers' rant about Snowden,  

Earlier in the day the whistle blower resurfaced via a satellite interview streamed at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts.

Snowden contended that the Boston Marathon bombing is an example of how acts of terrorism can occur even when the government is engaged in broad intelligence collection.

'The reality is that we knew who these guys were and who they were associating with,' Snowden told Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, according to the Boston Globe. 'But we didn’t follow up or watch these guys.'

He also argued that mass surveillance has not made the United States safer. The U.S. is actually more vulnerable to threats because of wiretapping and website hacking, he said.

'Once you make a backdoor into something, you can’t control who walks in through it,' he stated. 

Ex-Counterterrorism Center head Matt Olsen fired back at Snowden in an interview with CNN today.

Olsen said that because of Snowden, 'We've lost collection against some individuals, people that we were concerned about we are no longer collecting their communications.We lost insight into what they were doing.

'They've changed how they encrypt their communications and adopted more stringent encryption techniques,' Olsen said. 'They've changed service providers and email addresses and they've, in some cases, just dropped off all together.'

Congressman Rogers asserted on Tuesday evening that 'over 95%' of the data Snowden releaesd had 'nothing to do' to do with the government spying on private citizens. 

The bulk of it dealt with 'tactical things, military plans and operations.'

He also accused Snowden of hampering the United States' ability to conduct enemy surveillance.

'He took information that allows force protection, not only for British soldiers, but for US soldiers, and made it more difficult for us to track those activities. Meaning it is more likely that one of those soldiers is going to get their legs blown off or killed because of his actions,' he said. 

'Anybody that provides information to the enemy is a traitor, period, pure and simple.'

Rogers said he thinks it's suspicious that Snowden has been embraced by Russia, which has become increasingly estranged from the U.S.

Snowden has been living there in exile since the U.S. revoked his passport a little over two years ago. In August the country offered him asylum for three years and the option to become a citizen if he stays a for another year after that.

'Many don't find it odd he is in the loving arms of an SVR [Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service] agent right now in Moscow,' Rogers said.

'I do,' the intelligence committee head said.
