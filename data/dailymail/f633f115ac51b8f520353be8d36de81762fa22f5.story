Anyone who's familiar with pin up paintings will know the caricature-esque works of Gil Elvgren.

His fantastical cheesecake pictures feature curvy 1950s women revealing their stockings - and sometimes a bit more - in a series of eyebrow-raising situations.

And now it has been revealed that the late American painter's works were not just a figment of his imagination, but based on photographs of real women.

Fifties pin-up paintings by Gil Elvgren are shown side-by-side with the photographs that inspired them

A side-by-side collection of the paintings and the models who inspired them seen on Nerve.com reveals the similarities, but also where Gil exaggerated features best to comic effect.

The artist's painted ladies feature nipped-in waists, exaggerated busts, elongated legs and bouffant 
barnets.

It seems in the age before digital photo editing, it was paint which made women seem to posess an impossible beauty, as these erotic illustrations reveal.

Compared to the models they are based on, they are generally more coiffed and slender with softened facial features, but the poses are exactly the same.
