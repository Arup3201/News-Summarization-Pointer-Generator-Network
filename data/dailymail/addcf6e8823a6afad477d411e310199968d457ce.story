A new shark safety app will help swimmers know when it's safe to go back in the water.

The SharkSmart app, launched on Saturday by the NSW government, provides basic information on shark species and how to identify and avoid them across the state.

Tips include keeping out of the water during twilight or darkness, avoiding areas popular with diving seabirds and don't rely on dolphins to indicate the absence of sharks as they often feed together.

The app also includes two different maps pinpointing the specific beaches that have shark nets and swimming enclosures that offer swimmers a safer environment.

'There are no 100 per cent guarantees when entering the ocean,' Minister for Primary Industries Katrina Hodgkinson said.

'But the NSW government will continue doing all it can to reduce the risk for swimmers.'

The launch comes after shocking underwater footage revealed many of the nets which partially cover NSW beaches but reportedly 'have huge holes easily big enough for a shark to pass through'.

Twisted, tangled and tattered nets could soon be replaced with a new shark detecting system across NSW

Large holes were discovered in many of the shark nets, which many believe protect them from sharks

The state government has promised $100,000 to trial shark-detecting sonar technology that will alert lifesavers each time a shark swims close by if the coalition wins the state election. 

The sonar technology will initially undergo a trial at an aquarium, where it will need to be assessed how well the program differentiates between a shark and a dolphin or whale.

NSW goes to the polls in March and when it gets the all clear, it will be rolled out at popular beaches across the state.

Other shark-proof products that have been released, include: shark wristbands, anti-shark wetsuits, shark shields, ankle-worn devices and a variety of sonar technologies.

The latest band designed to prevent shark attacks on surfers and swimmers, Sharkbanz uses electromagnetic currents to deter sharks from an area.

Shark Shields sends electronic pulses from the device, which causes the shark to experience muscle spasms

The band, which was launched in Australia early this month, is about the size of a watch and has been tested on nearly a dozen species of sharks and aims to ensure humans and sharks can enjoy the ocean together without danger.

In 2013, Australian scientists developed a pair of anti-shark wetsuits that make divers appear invisible by camouflaging their bodies in the sea.

The blue pattern of the Elude suit aims to trick sharks into thinking surfers are poisonous and the colour can't be seen by the sharks because fishes are colour blind.

While the Shark Shield consists of two electrodes that emit a three dimensional electronic field that surrounds the swimmer. 

When a shark swims nearby, the strong electronic pulses and releases from the device, which causes the shark to experience muscle spasms.

Bondi Beach was the first to trial the 'Clever Bouy' which uses sonar technology to detect shark-shaped objects in coastal areas. When detected, the bouys send signal to the lifeguards.

It follows after Newcastle beaches were closed for a record of 10 consecutive days after a shark sighting

It follows after a string of repeated shark sightings along the NSW coast in recent weeks.

Beachgoers were forced to evacuate following the sighting of a shark along the coastline of NSW on January 10, prompting the closure of all six Newcastle beaches for a record of 10 consecutive days.

Several other sharks, including tiger sharks feeding on dolphins were seen along the coast but authorities have reopened the beaches after jetski patrols found no sign of the sea creatures.

Hundreds of swimmers were forced to dash for the shores at Manly and North Steyne beaches on the Nothern Beaches of Sydney after a shark was spotted in the water last week.

Just recently, a 17-year-old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark after he went spearfishing off Mollymook beach on the South Coast of NSW.

Sam Smith was taken to Milton Ulladulla hospital where he is in a stable condition, and later flown to Sydney for specialist treatment.
