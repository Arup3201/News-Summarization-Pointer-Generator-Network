The latest accuser in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse trial recalled showering with the disgraced coach and being touched and fondled by him when he was just 10 years old.

The man, now 27 and dubbed 'Victim 7' by prosecutors, said he never told anyone about the alleged abuse, but remains disgusted by chest hair because it brings back the memories of Sandusky pressing against him.

He testified that Sandusky had often touched him on the knees and crotch and it escalated to him 'touching my penis.'

Disgraced: Another alleged victim of Jerry Sandusky, seen arriving in court on Wednesday, said the ex-coach washed his hair in a Penn State locker room shower and tried to dry him off

In testimony recorded by the Philadelphia Inquirer, the alleged victim said that Sandusky coaxed him into taking a shower with him after tossing a football around at Penn State.

In the locker room, the man said Sandusky insisted on washing his hair and tried to wash his body, but he would not let him.

Sandusky also tried to dry him off with a towel, but again, the boy refused.

He spoke of attending Penn State football games with Sandusky's family and receiving free tickets from him as recently as 2009.

'I wanted to go to games, I tried to block that stuff out and focus on the positives,' he said.

The man said he only told his parents of the abuse last year, after being approached by police.

'The more negative thing I sort of put in the back part of my mind - closing a door, putting stuff in the attic is what I feel I did,' he said.

The testimony followed that of another accuser, who said he was 11 years old when Sandusky pinned him while wrestling in his basement, and performed oral sex on him before threatening that 'he would never see his family again' if he told anyone, an accuser testified today.

'Victim 10,' now 25, told the court that Sandusky assaulted him in the basement of the ex-Penn State assistant coach's State College home in the late 1990s, then threatened to keep him away from his biological family.

He claimed that he was about 11 years old and wrestling with Sandusky in his basement when the coach suddenly removed his shorts and began performing oral sex on him.

'The defendant pinned me to the ground, pulled my shorts down and began performing oral sex on me. I freaked out.'

He said that Sandusky stopped after several minutes and went upstairs before threatening him.

'He told me that if I ever told anyone that I'd never see my family again,' the accuser testified.Later, Sandusky offered a friendlier tone.

'He apologised for saying that,' the witness said. 'He told me he didn't mean it and that he loved me.'

The accuser added that he believed Sandusky's wife Dottie - who has come under much scrutiny about what she may have known about the alleged abuse - was home at the time.

The man said Sandusky assaulted other times in 1998 and 1999, including once at a pool and another time in the same basement that involved performing oral sex on each other.

He is one of two men who came forward after Sandusky was initially charged in November with assaulting eight boys.

Later on Wednesday, a co-worker of a janitor who said he witnessed sex abuse involving Sandusky about 10 years ago testified on the worker's behalf.

The boy's identity is not known to prosecutors, and the janitor, Jim Calhoun, is unable to testify himself because he had dementia.

Ron Petrosky said Calhoun - white with fear and hands shaking nervously - told him in a team locker room at the time that he saw Sandusky making a boy perform oral sex on him.

Mr Petrosky, a maintenance worker who still works at the school, also revealed that in 2000, he saw two sets of legs close together in a shower that appeared to belong to a young boy and a much older man, according to StateCollege.com.

Later, he claimed he saw Sandusky and a boy emerge from the locker room, both with wet hair.

'I said, 'Good evening, coach.' They exited the double doors and walked down the long hallway... about three quarters of the way down Jerry took the boy's hand,' Petrosky said.

Sandusky faces a total of 52 criminal counts involving alleged assaults over a 15-year span.

Under cross-examination, the man testified that he was the roommate of another Sandusky accuser at a camp sponsored by Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile.

The alleged victim admitted he had spent nearly two years in state prison for a robbery and involvement with alcohol and drugs, but said he has since cleaned up his act.

'I'm married. I'm expecting' a child, he said.

Earlier Wednesday, the father of former assistant coach Mike McQueary told the jury details of a phone call he had with his son after the former Penn State quarterback allegedly saw Sandusky behind a boy with his hands propped against a wall in a locker room shower, and heard 'skin-on-skin smacking sounds.'

Two other alleged victims have already testified, describing in graphic detail encounters with the coach that happened after they met him through his charity for at-risk youth.

Sandusky, 68, has denied the allegations. Authorities say he abused the boys in hotels, at his home and inside the football team's headquarters.

Sandusky's attorneys have suggested his accusers have financial motivations for coming forward.

Earlier in the trial

On Tuesday, Former Penn State assistant coach Mike McQueary told jurors in Jerry Sandusky's sex abuse trial today that he saw his ex-colleague with a boy in an on-campus shower after hearing 'skin-on-skin smacking sounds.'

Star witness: Mike McQueary testified on Tuesday that he saw Sandusky with a young boy in a locker room shower

He said that he turned and glanced over his right shoulder at a mirror that had a 45-degree angle and saw Sandusky 'standing behind a boy who was propped up against a wall'. He estimated the boy to be ten to 12 years old.

He said that the 'boy's hands (were) up on the wall. The glance would have taken only one or two seconds. I immediately turned back to my locker to make sure I saw what I saw'.

McQueary’s testimony came after ‘Victim No. 1’ tearfully recounted repeated instances of Sandusky kissing him, fondling him and oral sex, mostly in the basement of Sandusky's State College home during sleepovers.

Now 18, the witness recounted an early encounter that escalated to oral sex.

'I spaced,' the alleged victim said. 'I didn't know what to do with all the thoughts running through my head, I just kind of blacked out and didn't want it to happen. I froze.'

As he choked back tears, the sobbing teen recounted another time Sandusky forced him to perform oral sex, after saying it was his 'turn'.

On Monday, 'Victim No. 4 testified that the former Penn State assistant football coach sexually abused him as a young teenager on campus and in hotel saunas and later sent him 'creepy love letters'.

The accuser said that what began as 'soap battles' in the shower escalated into inappropriate touching and oral sex and that Sandusky would threaten him if he refused.
