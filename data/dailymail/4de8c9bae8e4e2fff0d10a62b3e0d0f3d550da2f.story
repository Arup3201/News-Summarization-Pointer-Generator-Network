FIFA president Sepp Blatter handed the trophy to Spain captain Iker Casillas in South Africa in 2010.

But with his popularity also low amid allegations of corruption inside footballâ€™s governing body, Bundchen will reportedly step in when the competition closes at the Maracana Stadium in Rio on January 13.

The Brazilian beauty is married to NFL star Tom Brady and has recently been named as the new face of Chanel No.5.
