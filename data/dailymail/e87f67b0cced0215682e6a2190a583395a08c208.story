He normally likes to portray himself as being tough and in control.

Previous pictures of Russian president Vladimir Putin have shown him riding topless on a horse and swimming through a river.

But a new video has emerged showing Putin speaking in English, something which he rarely does. And it shows a completely different side to one of the world's most powerful men.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Awkward: This new video has emerged which shows Russian president Vladimir Putin speaking in English. It is a rare occurrence, as the long-time leader normally prefers to speak in Russian

Standing in front of the camera, he looks uncomfortable and awkward, worlds away from the confident image which we are used to.

Putin was giving the speech in the video to address delegates for the International Exhibition Bureau.

It is part of his efforts to help make Russiaâ€™s fourth largest city, Yekaterinburg, the Expo 2020 host. The international event would help draw millions of visitors to Russia.

As reported by NBC News.com , he said: 'I am confident we shall welcome guest (sic) from over 150 nations of the world with pride and dignity.

'Now, once again, I would like to make this very clear: Russia guarantees to fulfill the complete range of requirements set by the International Expositions Bureau.'

The vast majority of the time the long-term Russian leader prefers to speak in Russian

At international events he often insists that he should follow official protocol and speak in his native language.

There have been some exceptions.

He presented the Sochi Olympics bid to the Olympic Committee in English in 2007.

And he also have a rendition of 'Blueberry Hill' by Fats Domino at a 2010 charity event in front of celebrities including Goldie Hawn, Kevin Costner and Sharon Stone.

The videos went on to become internet sensations.
