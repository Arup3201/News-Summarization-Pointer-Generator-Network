Indigenous Brazilians armed with bows and arrows tried to break into the lower house of the Brazilian Congress, battling with police who fired tear gas and pepper spray in response.

Around 30 Indians, many in colourful headdresses and some carrying arrows, clashed with law enforcement outside the building in the capital Brasilia yesterday in protest at a bill which would give parliament powers to demarcate indigenous territory.

One police officer escaped injury when an arrow struck his boot, but four of his colleagues were hurt in the clashes, as the indigenous people tried to force their way into the chamber of deputies.

Shocking images emerged of angry protesters squaring up to police in riot gear, who fought them off using shields, tear gas and pepper spray.

The group attempted to storm a committee which was taking a vote on the bill, causing it to be called off.

Four indigenous men were arrested on suspicion of throwing arrows at police officers. 

The authority to determine which areas of Brazil belong to native peoples currently resides with the country’s executive branch.

Indians and other opponents of the new bill say transferring that power to Congress would give more power to large landowners and mining and lumber companies that operate in the Amazon region where most of Brazil's indigenous population lives.

That's because they have too much influence over the country's parliament, protesters argue.

Indigenous leaders worry the new bill, known as PEC 215/00, could legitimise the occupation of large parts of their land in the Amazon by farmers and loggers.
