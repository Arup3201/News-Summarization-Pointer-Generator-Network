If you're often losing your car in the supermarket car park, how about this? 

A McLaren MP4-12C has become the world’s fastest piece of artwork after a tuning firm gave it a £90,000 multi-coloured makeover.

The British-built supercar, which retails at £175,000, normally comes in more traditional hues such as blue, black, silver or white. 

But a German tuning company - a workshop that specialises in souping up cars - has taken the idea of 'pimping your ride' to the extreme.

Torque of the town: Thanks to a £90,000 paint job, you will stand out in this £265,000 British-built McLaren supercar

Rainbow-coloured: Inspired by the classic BMW Art Cars of the 1970s, Hamann Motorsport has transformed the 12C, built in Woking, Berkshire, into an eye-catching coupe

Inspired by the classic BMW Art Cars of the 1970s, Hamann Motorsport has transformed the 12C, built in Woking, Berkshire, into an eye-catching coupe.

The tuning house has described the McLaren - named the memoR - as 'an exquisitely colourful piece of art'.  As well it might be with a total price-tag of more than £265,000.

For that you also get a 'bodykit' of new exterior accessories including bumper, new lights, new rear spoilier known as a 'wing', and a set of 21-inch alloy wheels to go with the paint job, which looks like it came out of US neo-pop artist Jeff Koons’ studio. 

Hamann, based in Laupheim, southern Germany, said: 'Grass-green Porsches, neon yellow Lamborghinis and even luminous red Ferraris will soon fade away into the background on most streets, as the latest creation from Hamann Motorsport steals the show.

'With the stage set like this, the refined two-seater will transform ugly streets into palatial catwalks, clothing its passengers in magnificent haute couture.'

Flying colours: The McLaren can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 3.1 seconds and hit a top speed of 205mph

The BMW Art Car project began in 1975 
when the German car manufacturer invited American artist Alexander 
Calder to create a canvas on one of its cars. 

Since then numerous artists including Andy Warhol, David Hockney and Roy Lichtenstein have created their own BMW Art Cars.

With a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the 616bhp McLaren was developed as a competitor to the Ferrari and is one of the world’s fastest supercars.  Autocar describes it as 'ferociously, apocalyptically quick'.

The McLaren can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 3.1 seconds and hit a top speed of 205mph.

What it looks like without the warpaint: Even without the paint job, this basic McLaren MP4-12C looks good
