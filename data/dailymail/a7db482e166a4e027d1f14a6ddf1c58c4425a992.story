Lionel Messi just keeps on finding new ways to stake his claim for status of greatest player ever. He's done the two-goal games, the three-goal games, even the four-goal games; throughout Spain on Thursday he was being hailed for a game he didn't even score in.

The victory over Manchester City was being seen as the most one-side 1-0 in the history of 1-0 wins and the man who set up the winner was given Man of the Match in all the reports of Barcelona’s passage to the last eight.

It was a game in which, for once, he had broken no records…only Manchester City's spirit, with a mesmerising display that left them doubting if they were worthy of being on the same pitch as him.

Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo hailed the 'Fantasic' Lionel Messi after his 'masterclass' against Manchester City that included 'nutmegs, dribbles and an assist', while he also featured on the front cover of Sport

Messi does that to opponents, not just bamboozling them with skill but undermining any confidence they may have that they can live with him.

'The best I've ever seen' said Javier Mascherano and Jordi Alba called it ‘another recital’ but in truth players don’t like what’s known as ‘the Messi question’ because whatever answer they give is going to be inadequate alongside the man they are trying to describe.

‘I'm just glad he plays for us said Luis Enrique'. The two nutmegs – one on Fernandinho and one on James Milner – reminded many of something the coach said before he managed Barcelona.

He said that Messi stands out from the rest not because he necessarily does anything different to other players, but that he does it in big games against big name rivals. 

All footballers grow up being able to belittle far inferior rivals – they do it on the school playground against other kids first, then in youth academies against youngsters with less talent, and then eventually in training as senior professionals against the reserve-team centre-backs. But Messi, in contrast, does it against internationals in big matches all the time.

It’s easy to laugh at his Manchester City victims but they are just two more of a long line as Messi takes playground football on to the big stage and runs rings around everybody just as in those grainy videos of him aged six and seven playing Baby-Football in Argentina.

It was fitting that Pep Guardiola was looking on on Wednesday night. The Bayern Munich coach was there with a view to scouting potential quarter-final opponents. It was Guardiola who transformed Messi from a wide attacker in Barca's front three to a deep-lying attacker – the famous false nine. Anyone who thought that would be the last Messi innovation was wrong – who knows where the Argentine was playing last night?

He now has complete freedom to go where he wants on the pitch and spends large chunks of games with a deep right-sided midfield spot as his starting position. That was where he found himself when he seemed to draw the entire Manchester City side to him in the first half, just before he released Ivan Rakitic for the goal that won the game on the night for Barcelona.

The new ‘more roving than ever’ role even begs the question is it time for coaches to start trying to man-mark him?

That in turn begs another question – would he have been so good in the age of cynical man-marking that allowed hatchet-men to scythe down great players without punishment?

That variable always needs to be factored-in to comparisons between him and Diego Maradona.

On Thursday in Barcelona the over-riding sentiment was: It’s good that football is not like that anymore, and we can enjoy Messi the magician to the absolute maximum.
