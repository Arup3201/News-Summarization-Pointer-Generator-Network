Bitcoin investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have allegedly splashed out $14.5 million on a Soho penthouse recently featured on Bravoâ€™s Million Dollar Listing New York (MDLNY).

The brothers, who received a $60 million settlement from Facebook in 2012 after claiming that founder Mark Zuckerberg stole their social networking concept, are reported to have paid cash for the triplex which features stunning 360-degree views of New York City.

The sale featured in a recent episode of MDLNY in which flamboyant realtor Fredrik Eklund was tasked with selling the triplex by real estate developer Justin Ehrlich who had carried out a meticulous gut renovation.

The penthouse's most impressive feature is undoubtedly the enormous wraparound terrace which offers stunning 360-degree views of the city

Ehrlich was seeking a 50 percent rate of return on the penthouse, which he had purchased only ten months earlier for $9.7 million.

Neither he nor Eklund were pleased when the brothers offered only $13 million - $2 million less than the asking price.

The reality show featured Eklund hatching a scheme to encourage an agent, believed to be working for the Winklevoss twins, to increase their offer.

When Eklund shows the impressive property to a new batch of agents, the agent realizes his clients could miss out and so they raise their offer to $14.5 million.

Eklund then convinces his client to drop his price by half a million and the deal finally gets done.

The buyer is listed as Casterlirock LLC, whose Delaware address is also that of the brothers' Bitcoin fund Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, reports The Observer.

The 32-year-old brothers gained notoriety following The Social Network in 2010. The Oscar-winning movie portrayed the pair as embittered early collaborators in the early stages of the site that would become Facebook.

In 2004, the Winklevoss brothers sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for $140 million, claiming he stole their ConnectU idea to create the popular social networking site.

They received a $60 million settlement in 2012 and since leaving social media, they've made a name in venture capital.

In March the brothers announced plans to become the first twins in space after signing on as the 700th and 701st passengers of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo rocket plane.

'Cameron and I contemplate our tickets into space - as seed capital supporting a new technology that may forever change the way we travel,' Tyler wrote in a blog.

Ashton Kutcher, Brad Pitt, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, and Stephen Hawking have all booked passage on the rocket.
