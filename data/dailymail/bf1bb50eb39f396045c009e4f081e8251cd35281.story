Her boyfriend has denied cheating on her with a Brazilian model known as Miss BumBum - but Irina Shayk looked far from happy as she was spotted for the first time since the scandal hit the headlines.

Superstar footballer Christiano Ronaldo has slammed the claims he slept with Andressa Urach as 'fiction and forgery'.

Russian beauty Irina showed the stress of the last 48 hours as she was spotted in New York, looking under pressure with her hair pulled back into a messy bun.

With her phone clamped to her ear as she walked through the streets no-one could imagine what the model was feeling.

Andressa Urach had claimed the Real Madrid striker slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a key Champions League semi-final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund.

The 27-year-old told The Sun: 'I have always thought Cristiano is one of the most gorgeous men in the world, so I couldn't believe it when he got in touch with me.

On Thursday Irina was in the UK attending the launch of the new Eleven Paris store in London.

The couple started dating three years ago - just weeks before Ronaldo announced he had become a father to a baby son with an unnamed American mother.

Although the Real Madrid player announced he had 'exclusive guardianship' of the tot Cristiano Jnr, his mother Dolores is helping to raise the child in Portugal.

Over the past few years, Irina seemed to have embraced the role as surrogate stepmother to the child and has been seen doting over the little boy on frequent occasions.

However, since they started dating in May 2010, the couple regularly go for weeks or sometimes months without seeing each other.

Irina is based in New York for her modelling work, but travels all over the world, while Ronaldo splits his time between Madrid and his native Portugal.

Ronaldo said in a statement on Twitter last night: ‘I was informed that The Sun, faithful to its editorial line, will publish an article where is given voice to a so called Andressa - someone seeking the limelight on my account.

‘And I wonder why this happens one day before a very important game for my team. Deeply outraged by a situation intended, in vain, to affect my personal life.

‘I just want to clarify I was in fact at the Hotel Villa Magna on April 22 giving an interview to Manu Sainz, something the reporter himself is able to corroborate. Everything else is pure fiction and forgery.'

The woman had told The Sun it happened a day after the £80million former Manchester United forward was pictured leaving a restaurant in Madrid with his girlfriend Irina Shayk.

Speaking about their tryst, she said: 'It was incredible, his body's perfect, like a Greek god. He went on for hours and would not stop talking about my butt.'

Miss Urach claimed Ronaldo told her he had dreamed about her behind and called her his 'little horse' before asking her to come to Madrid and meet up.

Miss Urach told how the pair linked up at the city's £12,500-a-night Villa Magna hotel after she took a taxi there and waited for him in the lobby.
