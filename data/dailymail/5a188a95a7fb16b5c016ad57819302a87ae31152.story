Critique: Shadow Aviation spokesman Gordon Marsden, pictured in 2011, warned that the new plans pose a security risk

New Government plans to cut ‘red tape’ for private-hire business jets and light aircraft could leave a gaping hole in Britain’s border security which ‘would-be terrorists and criminals’ could exploit, Labour said today.

It came after the government and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced plans in a consultation ‘to strip away unnecessary bureaucracy for the UK General Aviation sector’.

This General Aviation sector includes flights other than commercial scheduled air services and is worth around £1.4bn to the UK economy and supports up to 50,000 jobs.

Most of the world’s air traffic falls into this category, from gliders to corporate flights. It also includes proposals to deregulate use of single-seat microlight aeroplanes.

Aviation Minister Robert Goodwill said: ‘General Aviation is an extremely important sector of UK civil aviation and it is right that we do everything possible to enable it to thrive.

That includes making sure that, where appropriate, we ease the burden on what are often smaller operators and businesses who find navigating a complex regulatory framework particularly challenging.’

But Labour’s Shadow aviation spokesman Gordon Marsden, MP for Blackpool South said the Government documents and ministerial statements announcing the cutting of red-tape fail to address security or the risk of terrorist and criminal exploitation.

He said: ‘The Government claims they want to cut red tape but if their complacency on security issues isn’t addressed they’re in danger of creating a one-stop green light open-skies policy that criminals and potential terrorists could exploit.’

He added: ‘It’s frankly astonishing – given the level of concern about potential soft entry for would-be terrorists or criminals in the UK – and with thousands of small planes and hundreds of landing sites across the country where they may land – that the Department for Transport didn’t see fit to include such considerations in laying out a programme that will put heavy emphasis on self-regulation.’

Mr Marsden said: ‘It is extremely concerning that nowhere is there any focus or reference to security considerations that should be the top priority in any deregulation process.

‘The CAA document included eight themes on which the Government sought views – security concerns or implications do not figure in any of them.’

The Department for Transport said Mr Marsden’s fears appeared to be based on ‘a misunderstanding of the nature of this consultation.’

But the Labour MP said that only last month the Director General of the UK Border Force admitted to Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee that some arrivals on small planes are not checked by his officers: ‘He told the committee that he has no accurate figures available on the number of such flights, and that there is no system to synchronise with the national air traffic system to supervise these flights into the UK. ‘

The Labour aviation spokesman added: ‘We need urgent answers as to whether the UK Border Force or other security organisations were consulted or responded. And if not, why not.

‘We will be raising these issues urgently with the Department for Transport and the CAA and demanding that these concerns are given a central role as this process is rolled forwards’.

But a Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘This appears to be a misunderstanding of the nature of this consultation, which was about stripping the General Aviation sector of unnecessary red tape.

‘The next stage is for industry to come forward with their thoughts and ideas on what areas they would like the new dedicated panel within the CAA to look at.  We have no pre-conceived views on what the panel might recommend and do not want to place unnecessary constraints on it other than providing a final report by the end of April next year.’

Minister without Portfolio Grant Shapps said: ‘The measures we are announcing today will ensure that the regulatory framework is proportionate – deregulating completely wherever possible, and minimising regulation where it is still necessary.

‘This will ensure that we have effective safety regulation while supporting the sector to grow. This is in line with both the Government’s deregulation commitment and also its wider drive for growth in the economy.’
