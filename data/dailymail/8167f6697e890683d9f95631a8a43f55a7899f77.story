Two first-time fathers whose son was born during World Pride have responded to the poignant photos that won the internet's heart last week.

The images, shot by Canadian photographer Lindsay Foster, show Frankie Nelson, 44, and BJ Barone, 34, breaking into tears of happiness as they meet baby Milo for the first time.

'He’s definitely our Pride baby,' Mr Nelson told Today.com, adding, 'We’re so proud of him. That picture, to us, represents what pride is all about and how far the LGBT community has come. Love is love, and that’s what pride is all about.'

Ms Foster photographed Milo's birth as a gift to the couple’s surrogate, Kathy Frenette.

'She absolutely captured the most beautiful moment,' Nelson told Today.com of Ms Foster's pictures.

'I was completely overwhelmed. I was so scared of dropping the baby. Mostly, the feeling was of joy and love and amazement.'

Barone added: 'I was so excited, so overjoyed, so overcome with emotion, it was an incredible moment I will never forget. The fact we have this photo, it’s a reminder of how much love we have for him.'

New arrival: Baby Milo was born via gestational carrier and photographed by Lindsay Foster

Milo was born via an unrelated gestational carrier on June 27 in Kingston, Ontario. The family is now back home in Toronto.

'They
 are two compassionate people who felt all the emotions that every new 
parent feels,’ Ms Foster explained on the Facebook page for Lindsay Foster Photography.

'She did not use her own eggs and she was very happy to have given this
 gift,' Ms Foster explained. 

'The fact we have this photo, it’s a reminder of how much love we have for him'

Ms Foster said that she spent hours with the two fathers and they were well-prepared for the birth, but that did nothing to lessen their excitement and anxiety.

'They asked all appropriate questions of the birthing 
mom and the midwife and educated themselves as best as they could for 
their son’s arrival,' she said.

She also revealed that Mr Nelson and his partner were shirtless for the birth because skin-to-skin contact is reported to be beneficial to newborns.

So far, Mr Barone and Mr Nelson seem to be loving parenthood.

'We are so lucky that we have a beautiful, healthy baby boy!',' they wrote on Ms Foster's Facebook page - the photo, which has so far captured thousands of hearts, has garnered more than 50,000 likes so far.

The men said that they will respect all comments, positive and negative, writing: 'This is a moment of pure love and 
acceptance. Milo is surrounded by unconditional love and he will grow up
 knowing many different types of families and accept everyone, 
(intolerant people included).'

They added: 'Love has no color nor 
gender nor sexual preference. Love is unconditional.'
