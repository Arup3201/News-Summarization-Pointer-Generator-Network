An inspirational business student has refused to let being diagnosed with ovarian cancer put a stop to her ambition of taking part in the Miss Arizona pageant.

Kristina Anderson, 25, was told in July that she had an aggressive form of cancer and needed to start chemotherapy immediately.

While many young women in her situation would focus on getting better, Miss Anderson decided to enter the state pageant as a way to take her mind off her health problems.

'I thought it would be a good distraction to focus on something else,' Miss Anderson said.

In between chemotherapy treatments the former University of Chicago cheerleader has spent hours searching for dresses and preparing for the pageant, due to be held in Mesa in November.

'When I'm having chemo for eight hours a day, I'm able to get on the internet and shop for dresses,' she said.

Miss Anderson, who is studying for her MBA at Grand Canyon University, has also had to raise funds for the first six months of her cancer treatment because of exclusions in her medical insurance.

' It was a shock,' Miss Anderson told the East Valley Tribune. 'Sadness, anger, all different types of emotions.'

To help cover her medical costs, the student has set up a Go Fund Me website that has raise more than $11,000 so far.

With her family still in Illinois, Miss Anderson has been helped in her pageant preparations by one of the nurses from her doctor's office.

'Iâ€™m just kind of along for the ride. I went with her to pick out some dresses,' Sandy LeDuke said.

Finding the perfect outfits to dazzle the judges has also been an obstacle for Miss Anderson, who had to find gowns that would cover the port in her body where her life-saving drugs are administered.

She is also dealing with hair loss, telling ABC News: 'I'm trying to find unique ways to have pretty headwraps.'

Miss Anderson, who is due to start her fourth - and hopefully final - round of chemotherapy soon, said losing her eyelashes due to treatment made her sad, but the support from friends and family helped her stay positive.

Her determination has been supported by the current Miss Teen Arizona Olivia Argue, who tweeted: 'If this isn't inspiring I don't know what it.'

Pageant director Britt Boyse added: 'She has such a rare positive outlook on everything. She's fighting for her life, but no matter how poorly she feels, she's just happy, outwardly, and appreciative.'

The state pageant will be a big step for Miss Anderson, who has previously only competed at lower levels.

She said that despite her challenges she tried to remain upbeat and hoped her experiences would inspire others to overcome difficulties in their life too.

'I try to stay positive and just be at peace with myself because it is challenging to know what's in front of me,' Miss Anderson said.

'Just be positive and be grateful for what you have,' she added.
