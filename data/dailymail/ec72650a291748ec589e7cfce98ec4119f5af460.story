The brother of former EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie was caught on camera dragging a heavy suitcase containing his sister’s body parts, a court heard.

The grainy CCTV footage captured balding Tony McCluskie as he struggled to drag the dismembered body in the two foot high and three foot long case along the Regent’s Canal towpath in Hackney late at night.

Other cameras then recorded him as he walked across the pedestrianised Haggerston Bridge to the other side of the canal. A short while later he was picked up by the cameras before walking home without the suitcase.

Cordoned off: A police officer by Regent's Canal in east London where Miss McCluskie's torso was found in a suitcase after being thrown into the water in March last year

Nearly a quarter of an hour earlier 
CCTV footage showed McCluskie waiting for a mini cab and then struggling
to get it into the boot before being driven to the canal in East London
where the torso, limbs and head of his sister were dumped.

Hours later in the early hours of the morning the camera on Haggerston Bridge once again captured McCluskie near the canal.

It is alleged the 35-year-old cannabis 
smoker spent over three hours chopping his sister into bits after he
bludgeoned her to death following a row about an overflowing sink.

Witness: Taxi driver Jilul Haque drove Tony McCluskie, carrying a suitcase, to Regent's Canal in London where he then threw it into the water

The Old Bailey heard she wanted to 
throw him out after becoming frustrated with the amount of superstrong 
skunk cannabis Tony was smoking.

He had also flooded his 
mother’s bathroom after forgetting to turn a tap off on the day Mrs McCluskie was killed.

The jury were shown CCTV that captured the last hours of Miss McCluskie's life.

Wearing a distinct yellow mustard 
coloured top, blue leggings and tan Ugg boots she was seen mingling for 
an hour at a reception to celebrate the reopening of the Royal London 
Hospital in Whitechapel.

Then a CCTV camera at a health centre 
recorded Miss McCluskie in her blue VW Polo returning to the Shoreditch home she 
shared with Tony and mother Pauline, who at the time was in hospital.

The shot recorded just before 1.50pm 
on March 1 was the last sighting of the 29-year-old who played the 
character Kerry Skinner, the great niece of Ethel Skinner, in the hit 
soap.

But the following night around 10.30pm McCluskie rang his local mini cab office enquiring if there was a free cab.

Minutes later he turned up at the office in Waterson Street.

Controller Hamid Ahmed said McCluskie 
hesitated before giving his name as Tom and asked to be taken to the 'Kingsland Road just by the canal.'

Driver Jilul Haque said: 'He had a
bag - two foot high and three foot wide - a large bag. I asked him what
was in the bag and he replied to me his system - I thought he meant his
music system.

'He lifted it with two hands under that bag because it looked heavy.'

He added they drove for five minutes in silence before dropping him off and added: 'He did not look like a good man.'

Family: Gemma McCluskie's father Tony senior (left) and her brother Danny (right) have both attended court to watch the trial of Tony McCluskie junior

But McCluskie’s barrister Jeremy 
Dein QC asked: 'Might he have said sister, not system? The two words are
very similar. Is it possible thinking back, you said the two words are 
similar, that he said sister?'

He replied no and then prosecutor 
Crispin Aylett QC asked: 'If you thought there was a body in the bag, 
what would yopu have done?'

The Bengali national replied: 'I would not have taken it.'

Five days after the killing the suitcase was hit by a canal barge causing it to spring open and the torso was discovered.

Over the next fortnight her limbs were fished out but her haed wrapped in an sack was only found six months afterwards.

McCluskie admits manslaughter but denies murder.

The trial continues.
