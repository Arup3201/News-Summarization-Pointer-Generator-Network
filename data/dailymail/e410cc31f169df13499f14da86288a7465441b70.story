An artist has cashed in on the recent vogue for dense facial fuzz and created the Bearded Year calendar in which a scruff appears to get longer with every successive month.

Anna Marinenko, from Kiev, Ukraine, has drawn 12 beards in various stages of growth, beginning with January's designer stubble and finally ending in a full woodsman's beard in December.

Each stage is printed on transparent paper, making the fuzz seem bushier as the year goes on, and the pages are laid over each other.

An artist was inspired by the idea of growing facial hair to create her Bearded Year 2015 calendar

Ms Marinenko, who is selling her Bearded Year calendars for £40 on etsy.com, told FEMAIL that she decided to create a minimalistic simple calendar that she could print at home. 

She said: 'The idea was to illustrate something that could change during the year. A beard fits perfectly for this purpose.

'Beards are really popular, many men grow one and many women like them.'

She admits to being a fan of the facial hair herself, adding, 'it's natural and manly' and 'pleasant to touch'. 

The designer said she didn't expect so much attention on the project and has been overwhelmed by the number of likes and shares online. 

In 2014 we saw beard baubles and beard sculptures, now men can invest in a beard calendar

Thanks to being layered on transparent paper, the beard in Anna Marinenko's calendar appears to grow

The calendar consists of 12 transparent A4 layers for each month. The beard graphics overlay each other, mimicking the effect of growth over the period of time.  

For those who hoped 2014 had reached peak beard, this is evidence that we're still obsessed with all things whiskery.

In December alone, a series of accessories just for beards were created including beard baubles and icicles designed to nestle among the bristles.

A San Francisco-based father, Isaiah Webb, also became famous as Incredibeard - the creator of weird and wonderful sculptures made from his impressive chest-length facial hair.
