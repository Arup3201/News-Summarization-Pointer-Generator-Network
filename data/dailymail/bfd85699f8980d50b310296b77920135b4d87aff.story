Top gambler: Multi-millionaire Mr Ivey, 36, has been dubbed ¿the Tiger Woods of poker¿

One of the world’s top gamblers won £7.8 million in a game of chance by ‘reading’ the backs of the cards, claim the owners of Britain’s oldest casino, who are refusing to pay out.

Phil Ivey, dubbed ‘the Tiger Woods of poker’, is understood to have exploited tiny flaws in the card design during a game of punto banco, a type of baccarat based purely on luck.

He insists he did nothing illegal, however, and is suing Mayfair club Crockfords in the High Court in what is expected to be the biggest legal battle in casino history.

The technique has echoes of Kaleidoscope, a 1966 film starring Warren Beatty as a playboy who breaks into a card manufacturer to mark the cards and then beat the bank at every European casino.

The Mail on Sunday, which revealed last October that Mr Ivey’s winnings had been withheld, understands the cards were flawed because of a mistake during the cutting process at an overseas manufacturing plant.

Crucially, it meant their geometric pattern was not symmetrical, though this would not have been noticeable to the untrained eye. 

Cards should look exactly the same if turned 180 degrees. If they do not, it allows so-called advantage players to use a system known as ‘playing the turn’.

Multi-millionaire Mr Ivey, 36, was accompanied by an unidentified Chinese woman and was the only person playing against the croupier over three nights at the exclusive Mayfair club last August.

His remarkable winning streak was witnessed by a casino inspector and ten video cameras.Initially gambling £50,000 per hand, which can be over in less than a minute, he was later given permission by the management to increase his stake to £150,000.

It is thought his companion, who is banned from at least two casinos around the world, was also able to spot the imperfections and helped Mr Ivey place his bets. Like Mr Ivey, she lives in Las Vegas.

Along with two others, she is said to have won more than $1 million in similar fashion in the US in 2011, but the money was similarly withheld and the casino’s decision was later upheld by a gaming commission.

It is not clear if Mr Ivey and the woman heard about the rogue cards at Crockfords before arranging the punto banco game or simply noticed them while playing.

Punto banco is the sister game of chemin de fer, the high-stakes card game favoured by James Bond.

The aim is to hold cards with a count of nine or closest to nine. You bet that either the hand held by the player (punto) or banker/croupier (banco) will win and place bets on the appropriate area on the table. Tens and picture cards and multiples of ten count as zero.

Though Mr Ivey was not allowed to touch the cards at any point, he is thought to have instructed the dealer to tilt each card back to expose its value.

The key cards he was looking out for were nines and eights, and possibly sevens and sixes. When these cards appeared, his companion asked for them to be rotated 180 degrees, pretending that Mr Ivey was superstitious.

As this appeared to give him no advantage, the dealer acquiesced.

The rotated cards were returned to the shoe and were easily recognised by the player as different when they were eventually re-dealt, giving him a strong edge. At first, his losses were heading towards £500,000 but he recovered, and at the end of the first night was £2.3 million up. He is also thought to have persuaded the casino not to destroy the cards at the end of each session, which is normal practice.

By ‘holding the shoe’ his rotated cards were preserved for the following day’s play.

The 184-year-old casino, the oldest private gaming club in the world, initially agreed to transfer his winnings to his bank account, but nine months on it has returned only his £1 million stake. Crockfords is owned by Genting, a Malaysian gaming corporation, which sent investigators to London to question employees and scrutinise hours of CCTV footage.

Willy Allison, a leading casino suveillance specialist, warned the gaming industry about flawed cards in November 2011.

He described their exploitation as the ‘latest scam to hit Las Vegas casinos’, adding: ‘Not every player who wins a lot of money at the casino is a cheat. You don’t have to be.

‘By turning an asymmetrical card 180 degrees it is possible to identify what the value of the card is before it is revealed. You simply glance at the edges on the back of the card.

‘Essentially, playing the turn has the same effect as marking the cards and gives players a huge house edge.

‘Who needs invisible ink and red-tinted sunglasses when you’ve got manufacturer-made “marked cards”.’

Mr Allison said casino card manufacturers are under pressure to produce more and more cards, mainly due to massive demand in Macau where millions are used — and destroyed at the end of each session — every day.

‘Inevitably quality control goes down because of this,’ he said last night. ‘Casino management should be vigilant when it comes to manufacturer defects and flaws.’

Mr Ivey said: ‘I was given a receipt for my winnings but Crockfords has withheld payment. I have no alternative but to take legal action.’

A spokesman for Crockfords said: ‘We shall be defending this claim vigorously.’
