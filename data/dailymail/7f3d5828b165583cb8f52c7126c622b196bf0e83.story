Have you ever watched The Jeremy Kyle Show, when some loser is exposed by a lie detector as a cheat. The details of how he slept with someone else behind his wife’s back are made public, and the audience boo him. And then they jeer and laugh as he declares he still loves his wife and never stopped loving her.

Frank Lampard is due an appearance on Jezza’s show soon because of what happened at the Etihad at the weekend. 'I cheated on Chelsea – but I still love that club!' A Kyle audience would hound him off the stage: but football fans are so over-emotional they swallow this garbage.

One of the great things about Lampard’s goal against Chelsea on Sunday is that this myth that a professional footballer can love a club has been exploded and hopefully no fan will ever be so naïve they embarrass themselves by spouting such nonsense ever again.

The general rule is that players play for whoever will pay them the most. 'I love this club, I never wanted to leave,' actually translates as: 'I was going to leave but they increased my money so I stayed.'

It’s not a problem, unless a player tries to convince us they love a club. In Lampard’s case he didn’t want to leave Chelsea, but he had no choice – the club didn’t want to keep him.

But that doesn’t mean he should agree to go to Manchester City on loan where he knows he is likely to play against Chelsea.

Who knows how the season will pan out, but that goal Lampard scored at the Etihad might be crucial. If Manchester City pip Chelsea to the title by a point in May then it will be Lampard’s equaliser that will be remembered as a massive moment that helped deny Chelsea the title.

So how can Lampard claim to love a club when that club is denied two points by a goal he has scored? That goal potentially, damages Chelsea’s chances of winning the title for the first time since 2010. Every fan of a football club knows exactly what I’m talking about. If you love a club, you don’t do anything to damage their chances of being successful.

Lampard said: 'I didn’t expect to come on and score.' Really? Chelsea’s all-time top scorer, a man who’s biggest strength throughout his career has been his ability to score goals, is brought on with Man City losing 1-0, and he didn’t expect to score?

I appreciate it’s sometimes difficult after a game for a player to find the right thing to say. And ultimately I’m not criticising Lampard for playing the game and scoring a goal – it’s what he does best of course.

But this should be a lesson to all professional footballers: only the most gullible fans will swallow your nonsense about your 'love' for their club. You can’t love a club and then score against them – no amount of applauding those fans afterwards will take that goal away.

Lampard loved his time at Chelsea, he loved the support of the fans he had at Stamford Bridge. But he can’t love Chelsea and then score such a big goal against them.

At the risk of returning to the Jeremy Kyle analogy again, it’s in Lampard’s DNA to score goals; as he said after the game: 'I’m just doing my job.' I respect Lampard for that. But people who love a football club give up work to show that love and watch them. They don’t 'just do their job', damage them, and then still profess love.

Lampard can do what he wants – play for who he wants, and score for who he wants.

But he’s mugged off Chelsea fans massively here. If it is true love he wouldn’t dream of playing against them, especially not a title rival. He didn’t have to join Man City but he did. And as soon as he did that, as Mourinho said, 'The love stories are over.'

And the Chelsea fans with their Frank Lampard banners at the Etihad looked like the man on the Kyle show who walked in on his missus in bed with another bloke. 'I can forgive everything!' he desperately cries, as the rest of the world cringes for him.
