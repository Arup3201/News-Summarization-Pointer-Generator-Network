A British family have been awarded £12,300 by Thomas Cook after their Mexico holiday turned into a disaster.

Dianne Blakeway, 57, her husband Roy, 61 and sons Ben, 20, and Robert, 30, all fell ill with a violent gastric bug during their trip to the Gran Caribe Real Resort & Spa in Cancun.

After recovering from the illness, Mrs Blakeway, from Cheshire, then had a fall on her way to the restaurant, leaving her in severe pain and with soft tissue injuries.

Thomas Cook had initially denied liability but eventually reached an out-of-court settlement. The family were awarded £5,800 for the illness and a further £6,500 for Mrs Blakeway's accident.

The Blakeways had been in Mexico in May 2014 as part of a 24-strong party celebrating a family wedding.

'After the outbreak, the resort closed the restaurant for two days, whilst men in white suits were seen disinfecting corridors and rooms,' Mrs Blakeway said. 

'Glasses were no longer being used for drinks and were replaced with plastic cups.'

According to Holiday Illness Claims, owned by Farnworth Rose solicitors, Thomas Cook reached a settlement after court proceedings were issued. 

A spokesperson for Thomas Cook told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that the Blakeway family fell ill and Mrs Blakeway was injured while on holiday at the Gran Caribe Real Resort & Spa, Mexico

'We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with the family’s legal representatives and that this matter is now resolved.'

The holiday company added: 'Thomas Cook makes strenuous efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the holidays it sells having dedicated teams who undertake audit programmes and work with hotels in the event that issues are identified.

'We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us as quickly as possible while in resort or the UK so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.'

It is important to make sure you have all the correct inoculations ahead of travel, particularly when venturing to more exotic climes beyond Europe.

When in any resort, take all the necessary precautions to avoid falling ill, washing hands, staying away from food if you are not happy with how it has been cooked or presented or using probiotics to help increase resistance to bugs. Also, make sure you pack a first aid kit with medicines you may need as well as plasters, rehydration sachets, antiseptic wipes and painkillers.

Tesco Bank recommends holidaymakers try and avoid undercooked meat, shellfish and salads as they may not have been washed in safe water.

If you fall ill despite taking precautions, flag it immediately to your hotel and tour operator, especially if the illness results in cancelled day tours etc. The companies will need a record of your illness, and may even call a doctor for you, in order to help facilitate refunds if needed.

Travel insurance is key if illness progresses, with average bills for healthcare abroad reaching £900 according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI).

In Europe, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is not a substitute for travel insurance, but will afford the carrier to receive hospital treatment in the European Economic Area and Switzerland on the same basis as a resident of that country.

Contact your insurer at the earliest possible moment as emergency helplines can assist with suggesting and arranging appropriate medical facilities, liaising with hospitals on your behalf and offering guidance on what to do next.

According to the ABI, your policy will normally stipulate an amount below which you should pay for the treatment received – usually £500 – and then claim that back from your insurer when you return to the UK.

Where the cost is above the amount stipulated in your policy, your insurer will normally be able to settle the bill on your behalf.

Tracy Stansfield, the solicitor who acted for Dianne in her injury claim, said: 'I am pleased we were able to reach a settlement for Mrs Blakeway after the problems she encountered during her holiday.' 

'It is very unfortunate to suffer both personal injury and illness whilst on holiday,' she said. 'I'm delighted we were able to help the Blakeways obtain compensation for the very nasty illnesses they experienced.'
