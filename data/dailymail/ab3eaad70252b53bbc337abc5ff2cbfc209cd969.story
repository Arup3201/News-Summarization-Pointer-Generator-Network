The new crop of Kennedy Center Honorees gathered together on Saturday for the 2014 class photo. 

And while every year brings in a new group of five amazing individuals who have made major contributions to the arts, this year was a particularly impressive one.

The 2014 group of legends is comprised of singers Sting and Al Green, actor Tom Hanks, writer and actor Lily Tomlin and ballet dancer Patricia McBride.

'The Kennedy Center celebrates five extraordinary individuals who have spent their lives elevating the cultural vibrancy of our nation and the world,' stated Kennedy Center Chairman David M. Rubenstein.

'Al Green's iconic voice stirs our souls in a style that is all his own; Tom Hanks has a versatility that ranks him among the greatest actors of any generation.

One of the world's greatest ballerinas, Patricia McBride continues to carry forward her legacy for future generations. 

Sting's unique voice and memorable songwriting have entertained audiences for decades; and from the days of her early television and theatrical appearances, Lily Tomlin has made us laugh and continues to amaze us with her acting talent and quick wit.'

The President and Mrs. Obama will receive the Honorees and members of the Artists Committee who nominate them, along with the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees at the White House prior to the gala performance Sunday, which will also feature appearances and performances from some of the biggest stars in the entertainment industry. 

The five honorees also got to enjoy a private dinner on Saturday evening at the State Department.

Stephen Colbert will be the host of Sunday's ceremony.
