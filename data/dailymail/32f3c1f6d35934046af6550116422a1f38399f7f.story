In their smart uniforms and happily holding hands, two little girls start school yesterday. Sisters, perhaps, or twins? No – they are actually aunt and niece.

Daisy Wilson and her niece Ruby Stephenson, both four, are in the same class at primary school in Chorley, Lancashire.

Their mothers, Alison Wilson, 43, and her 25-year-old daughter Ashley Stephenson, gave birth in next door hospital beds just 72 hours apart.

Daisy arrived first, making her three days older than her niece.

The girls have been inseparable ever since and Mrs Stephenson, who is married to Mike, said: ‘It is lovely knowing that Daisy and Ruby have somebody they are close to in the same class.’

Since Daisy’s birth Mrs Wilson and her husband Chris have had a third daughter, Heidi, two, while Mrs Stephenson has had another girl, Darcy, one. 

Mrs Wilson said: ‘It is difficult for people to understand that Daisy and Heidi are Ruby and Darcy’s aunties!’ 

The grinning girls may look like twins but they are actually auntie and niece
