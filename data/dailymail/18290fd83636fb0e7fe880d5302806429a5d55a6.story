Cracking an iPhone screen previously meant purchasing a completely new handset or entrusting the smartphone to unofficial menders to fix the screen.

But now Apple is rumoured to be rolling out an in-store service that could mean iPhone 5C owners with a cracked screen could have them repaired while they wait.

The service is thought to be being rolled out across the world from today.

Oops:  Apple is rumoured to be rolling out an in-store service that could mean some iPhone owners with a cracked screen (illustrated) could have them repaired while they wait

Apple rumour website 9to5Mac claims owners of the company's colourful ‘budget’ handset - the iPhone 5C - could have a cracked screen replaced for $149 (£90) in a matter of hours.

The website’s ‘multiple sources’ also claim that Apple will begin to trial iPhone 5 screen repairs too in selected U.S.stores.

Apple has not confirmed the rumours but it has been offering in-store iPhone 5C screen repairs in a number of U.S. shops over the past couple of months.

A member of Apple’s tech support team was vague about whether the in-store service is available in the UK this week. He told MailOnline that if staff working in one of the company’s stores can help, they will.

Apple rumour website 9to5Mac claims owners of the company's colourful 'budget' handsets - the iPhone 5c - could have their screen replaced for $149 (£90) in a matter of hour. The handsets were unveiled by Paul Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at the company, in September of last year

He said that an iPhone is considered out of warranty if it is smashed  - so the repair will cost money, but the repair option is cheaper than buying a brand new handset.

Currently, the screens of various models can be fixed if they are sent away, with a screen for the iPhone 4S costing £160 and an iPhone 5s £220.

Apple's patent shows a weight inside the phone can alter its centre of gravity, ensuring the screen doesn't smash

The new in-store service is expected to be 
rolled out in the UK and other major Apple markets this week, with the 
exception of Hong Kong and Canada.

A study by case maker Tech 21 claims that 90 per cent of people drop their phones every month, The Telegraph reported, suggesting that Apple's service could prove very popular.

Approximately four out of five people think a repair is essential if they crack their screen, while 20 per cent said they would carry on using their phone when it is broken.

However, future models of the iPhone might not need an in-store screen fixing service at all, if future plans of an indestructible handset come to fruition.

A patent application filed in March of last year by Apple, showed a phone that can automatically protect itself.

Published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's 'Protective Mechanism for an Electronic Device' patent uses sensors to work out when the handset is falling.

Once this is worked out, the patent shows a number of ways the handset can be 'saved'.

They include grips on the headphone cord, a weight inside the phone to alter its centre of gravity, 'wings' and even a gas canister to keep it from hitting the floor.
