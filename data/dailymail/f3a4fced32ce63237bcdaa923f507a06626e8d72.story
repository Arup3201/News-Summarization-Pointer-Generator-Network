A a prototype of the Shimi robot, which dances along to a user's music. It's inventors have now set up a Kickstarter project to manufacture the gadget.

'We are seriously excited to present our project to you: Shimi, the first musically intelligent robotic speaker dock,' it's creators say.

'Shimi is a real robot with artificial intelligence that analyzes music it plays through his speaker-ears and generates real-time unique dance moves to bring the music to life in a fun, cute way.'

The gadget uses five motors to move, and also has facial recognition software so it can automatically rotate so its speakers are always pointing towards the listener.

It also has a microphone and can understand human speech, so owners can simply tell it what they want to hear.

They can also tap along and the robot will adjust its rhythm accordingly.

The team also promises to keep developing the robot once they hit their $100,000 target.

'We will keep developing new applications for Shimi.

'We are already working on applications that will allow Shimi to respond to your facial expression, learn your musical tastes, and recommend new music to you.

'Expect apps for gaming, education, music making, telepresence and more, very soon.'
