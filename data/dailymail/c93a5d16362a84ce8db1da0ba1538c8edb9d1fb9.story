One in 20 drivers have illegally paid someone to take penalty points for them, according to a new study.

The research found six per cent have asked a friend or relative to take their points and a shocking five per cent confess to paying someone.

But only half of those who have swapped points say they were caught (54 per cent) and as a result 39 per cent of motorists are calling for point swapping drivers to face criminal prosecutions.

Former cabinet minister Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce each received eight month prison sentences two years ago for perverting the course of justice after they lied about swapping speeding points.

Data retrieved through a Freedom of Information request also showed a staggering 70,158 motorists are on the brink of being banned, holding nine points - just three from a potential ban.

Meanwhile, more than 6,800 motorists in the UK have 12 points or more on their licence.

Extraordinarily, one UK driver, who is still on the road, has a staggering 45 points, clocked up for nine speeding offences and 36 of failing to disclose the identity of the vehicle driver.

The data was gathered by the car insurance comparison site Confused.com and showed the lengths people are willing to go to avoid a driving ban.

Of the motorists who admit swapping points, more than half have done so at least three times and more than one in seven think the penalty point system is not fit for purpose.

The most common reason for swapping points with someone else is to keep their license clean, while a quarter of motorists admitted asking someone to take them because they were facing a driving ban.

In total, 2,928,222 motorists currently have penalty points on their licence.

The study found more than a third of us have received points for a motoring offence, with 80 per cent of these due to speeding.

Absurdly, more than one in 10 motorists (11 per cent) even claimed they didn't know the practice of swapping penalty points is illegal.

Drivers are legally obliged to inform their insurers they have points on their licence, however more than one in six admit failing to do so.

Many drivers said they would commit a crime by taking points for a family member.

Three quarters of drivers who said they would take someone else's points (72 per cent) said they would do so for their partner and a third said they would take points for their child, parent or sibling.

More than a third of those who have taken points for someone else (37 per cent) defended their decision to do so by saying the driver in question could have lost their job.

The research also revealed some professions are more inclined to swap points than others.

Motorists who work in the hospitality industry topped the list of professions trading points, followed by those who work in property and those who work in research.

Young drivers seem to be more likely to swap penalties, with 15 per cent of drivers aged 18 to 24 admitting to asking a friend or family member to take points, compared to just seven per cent of those aged 35 to 44. 

The driver with 45 points is still on the road as a result of a loophole in the system which states an MS90 offence (failing to disclose the identity of the vehicle driver) is not something someone can be disqualified for.

Gemma Stanbury, Head of Motor Insurance at Confused.com said: 'It's concerning to see that one in 20 motorists (five per cent) admit taking on a friend or relative's penalty points.

'Avoiding penalty points for a motoring offence means many drivers who are prone to offences, such as speeding, remain on the roads, where they may pose a risk to others.

'Penalty points are designed to deter drivers from repeatedly breaking the law and to penalise those who do.

'The police are aware there are drivers on the roads who are illegally swapping points, and motorists should remember the police have direct access to DVLA data where they can look at anyone's driving record to compare photos.

'It can be easy for the police to match photos using DVLA information, and to check whether the person taking points is the vehicle's driver.

'Incurring multiple sets of penalty points can result in motoring fines, increased insurance premiums, and even disqualification from driving, so motorists should always drive safely and responsibly.'
