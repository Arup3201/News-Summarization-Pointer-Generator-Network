It's enough to make your stomach churn.

This daredevil climber braves navigating a mountain top - with a video camera attached to his head.

The breathtaking footage shows the man's shoes as he carefully makes his way up the Stetinden mountain, in Oppland, southern Norway.

His heavy breathing can be heard as he navigates the steep craggy rocks - with his back to the mountain and a sheer drop on either side.

The 54-second video shows the man crawling on his hands and knees across the most narrow part of the cross - revealing stunning scenery.

He walks across the top of the mountain, reunited with his climbing buddy, as he falls to his hands - seemingly in relief of reaching the other side of the rocks.

Life on the edge! The climbers knees can be seen as he navigates a steep part of Stetinden in Norway

Stetinden is popular with climbers - with its summit 6,627ft above sea level.

It's a peak where hikers can have one foot in Lom county and the other in Luster county
