The blue silk garter ribbon worn by Charles I in his famous van Dyck portrait may have been discovered - attached to a book.

Researchers believe four pieces of cloth could be the sash owned by the monarch after one was radiocarbon dated to the mid 17th century - the period when the King ruled.

The discovery was made after Anthony van Dyck's portrait, which features three images of Charles, was selected for a new exhibition and Royal Collection Trust curators decided to examine the silk pieces which were attached to a book about the King.

The 17th century tome called the Eikon Basilike - The Royal Portrait - 
was published 10 days after the monarch's execution on January 30, 1649,
and was once owned by the Queen's grandmother Queen Mary.

Charles' death came after he was tried for treason and convicted, and it
followed the defeat of his forces in the Civil War and his capture.

The 17th century book, probably written in part by Charles, contains 
accounts of various events and hardships the King encountered in the 
years before his defeat.

It features an inscription that claims the pieces of cloth are from the 
garter worn by the sovereign but this was treated with caution by 
curators as the wording appears to date from the 18th century.

The garter ribbon and the portrait will be reunited in the trust's new 
exhibition In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion, which 
explores the fashionable attire of European royal courts in the 16th and
17th centuries.

In the van Dyck portrait, the King is wearing a lace collar or 'cloak 
band', decorated with a soft scallop design popular during the mid-17th 
century.

A rare surviving lace collar, thought to have been worn by Charles I and
dating from around the same year as the painting, completed in 1636, 
has been lent to the exhibition by the Bowes Museum.

Anna Reynolds, the trust's curator of the exhibition, said: "The 
exhibition presented us with a unique opportunity to bring the painting 
back to life through some of the fashionable items the artist recorded 
the King wearing and to compare the three-dimensional objects with the 
two-dimensional image.

"It's incredible to think that these lengths of silk could in fact be 
the garter ribbon in one of the most enduring images of the King."

The exhibition In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion will 
be held at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace from May 10 to October
3.
