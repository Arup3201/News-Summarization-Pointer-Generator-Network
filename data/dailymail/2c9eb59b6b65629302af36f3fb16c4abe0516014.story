Two young people were shot dead and 19 others, including an infant, injured after gunmen sprayed bullets into a crowd at an outdoor barbecue in Toronto.

The names of victims have not been released, but one was a young teenage girl and the other a 20-year-old man.

Many of those hurt were injured in the panic that ensued after shots were fired in Scarborough, a suburb in east Toronto just before 11pm last night.

'It is the most serious crime of its kind that has ever taken place in the city of Toronto,' said Police Chief Bill Blair.

Police have made appeals for witnesses to contact them as they began to pull together descriptions for what appeared to be multiple shooters.

A handgun was recovered near the scene, and Mr Blair said one of the injured was considered “a person of interest,' but they are still  looking for other suspects.

The shooting took place on Danzig Avenue, near Morningside Avenue and Lawrence Avenue East in 
the city's east side after a fight erupted.

'An
altercation broke out among some individuals and there was an exchange 
of gunfire. During that gunfire a number of innocent bystanders were 
struck,' said Blair.

'It's a very shocking event, a lot of people were injured tonight.'

Blair
did not provide the age of the child who was injured but says the 
injuries are 'not life-threatening and the child will be fine.'

Coming barely six weeks after a shooting at a shopping mall that killed one and wounded six, it is likely to raise fears about the use of guns in a city which takes pride in its relatively low crime rate compared with U.S. urban centres.

At the time of last shooting in Toronto's Eaton Centre the city's mayor, Rob Ford, described it as an isolated incident in 'the safest city in the world.'

Claudia Wilson, told the Toronto Star that her 20-year-old daughter was at the barbecue when the shooting took place.

'Suddenly she was dodging bullets over there,” said Wilson, her daughter crying nearby.

'They were all in one place and all of a sudden the shots were fired, no one knows where they came from.'
