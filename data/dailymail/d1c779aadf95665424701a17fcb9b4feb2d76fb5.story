A priest is under investigation after allegations he halted his sermon to publicly shame a wheelchair-bound, partially sighted dementia sufferer for rustling her prayer sheet.

It is claimed that Father John Lochran, 67, suddenly stopped Mass to rebuke retired psychologist Frances Haler, 87, who also suffers from leukaemia.

The congregation at the Roman Catholic church looked on as the priest – who denies the accusation – told the octogenarian: ‘Will you stop rustling!’

After the service, Mrs Haler’s daughter Toni Bewley said she confronted Father Lochran but he was said to have retorted: ‘It’s my church.’

He is then said to have suggested the elderly lady take communion in her nursing home instead of his church.

The incident at St Winefride’s Roman Catholic Church in St Asaph in Denbighshire, is being investigated by the Bishop of Wrexham, the Right Reverend Monsignor Peter Brignall.

Last night the pensioner’s family condemned the priest.

Mrs Bewley, 60, a college lecturer from Bodelwyddan in North Wales, said: ‘Mum was really quiet throughout the service, and then I got the hymn and prayer book and all the bits of paper. Mum folded the paper in half and held it up close to her eyes.

‘He looked up and said, “Will you stop rustling paper and holding paper up – I’m doing a sermon.” Thankfully, I don’t think Mum realised.

‘I was absolutely livid. At the end of the service I told him he had publicly humiliated my mother.

‘He said he was in the middle of his sermon and he was in flow and it was disturbing him.

‘I have got more Christianity in me than he has in his big toe. I’ve been left very upset.

‘I just can’t see what justification he had to humiliate her in the way he did. It’s so sad, given dwindling congregation numbers, that he could be like this.

‘It’s made me question my faith. There’s no way he can justify such an un-Christian attitude.’

Mrs Bewley said her mother usually enjoyed the services because it helped with her dementia by allowing her to recall long-term memories.

But trouble started before this particular service even began, when Father Lochran directed Mrs Haler to sit at the side of the church by the organ – despite her being blind in one eye and partially sighted in another.

When Mrs Bewley told him she would not be able to see the Mass, he allegedly responded: ‘This is where she sits, this is my church.’

The incident happened earlier this month when Mrs Haler was attending the Saturday evening Mass in a 29-strong congregation just 200 yards from the nursing home where she lives.

Scots-born Father Lochran, who has been at the church for 14 years, said: ‘For many years I was chaplain to pilgrims at Lourdes. I would never speak to someone with dementia like that – and I didn’t on this occasion.’

A Diocese spokesman said: ‘Bishop Peter has no comment to make until the issues have been thoroughly investigated.’
