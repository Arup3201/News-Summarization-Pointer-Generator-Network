A domestic violence victim sexually exploited by a police officer on a 999 call was today suing a force for £25,000 over gross abuse of power claims.

PC James Formby, 34, was on duty and in uniform in Bromley, south-east London, five years ago when he allegedly plied the ‘vulnerable’ woman with drink and engaged in a sexual act with her.

He was convicted of criminal misconduct in 2010 and dismissed from the Metropolitan Police - but the force does not accept responsibility for his actions, and the woman aged 37 is now suing them. 

In court: PC James Formby (left, and right at his sentencing in 2010), 34, allegedly plied the ‘vulnerable’ woman with drink and engaged in a sexual act with her

Ruth 
Brander, representing the claimant, said: ‘The claimant accepts the 
account she gave to police shortly after these events. She stated she 
had asked Formby to kiss her.’

She
 added that Formby then asked the woman, who cannot be named for legal 
reasons, to perform a sex act on him and later texted her, saying: ‘You 
were amazing. Can't wait to see you again Xxx.’

The
 woman is now suing the Metropolitan Police for compensation of up to 
£15,400, plus a further £11,000 ‘if it is found that the claimant did 
not have a capacity to consent to the sexual activity’.

She will be giving evidence 
about the September 2009 incident at Central London County Court near 
Regent’s Park in front of the former officer, in a bid for compensation 
from the force.

In
 her skeleton argument, Miss Brander said: ‘The complainant complains 
that Formby, for whom the defendant is vicariously liable, abused his 
position of trust as a police officer and the claimant was an 
intoxicated victim of domestic abuse.’

She
 added that he ‘took advantage of her vulnerable state for his own 
sexual gratification in circumstances where he was in wilful neglect of 
his duty and was recklessly indifferent to the harm that was likely to 
be, and was, caused to the claimant as a result’.

Lawsuit: PC Formby was convicted of criminal misconduct and dismissed from the Metropolitan Police

She
 said: ‘Formby was charged by the defendant and convicted, by his own 
guilty plea, of misconduct in a public office in respect of events 
forming the basis of the claimant's claim.

‘Further he has been dismissed from the defendant's force for gross misconduct and bringing the force into disrepute.

'She felt confused and was trying to sort out in her head whether she had a right to be angry'

Ruth Brander, for the woman

‘Yet
 in these proceedings, the defendant seeks to deny that the officer's 
conduct constitutes misfeasance and, in the alternative, denies that 
[the force] is vicariously liable for such conduct.’

Miss
 Brander told the court that at first her client had not realised what 
had happened but that when she ‘sobered up’ she became ‘increasingly 
concerned and distressed’.

She
 added: ‘She was also blaming herself for what happened. Initially she 
felt that because she had not said “no”, she had let it happen and this 
caused her to question whether it was her fault.

‘It
 had not sunk in at that stage how wrong it was for an officer to have 
acted in that way. She felt confused and was trying to sort out in her 
head whether she had a right to be angry.'

Miss Brander also submitted that following the incident her client had suffered a ‘depressive and anxious adjustment disorder’.

She said that this fell within the range of £4,730 to £15,400 for damages.

However,
 she added that if it was found that her client had not had capacity to 
consent, then a further sum should be awarded to reflect the assault, 
with a tariff of up to £11,000 available in respect of non-consensual 
penile penetration.

Miss 
Brander submitted that there are number of aggravating features that 
would mean she would not receive sufficient compensation if the awards 
were restricted to a basic award.

She
 outlined these as being the ‘significant degree of humiliation’ 
suffered by her client, the fact that Formby's actions involved a grave 
breach of trust and a reckless disregard for the legality of his 
actions.

It was added the claimant was ‘especially vulnerable through her intoxication’ and her recent experience of domestic violence.

Miss
 Brander said: ‘The Commissioner resists the claimant's claim on 
misfeasance on the basis that sexual activity was consensual and 
consensual sexual activity was not in the performance - or purported 
performance - of the Additional Party's (Formby's) duties as an officer.

Hearing in 2010: PC Formby was given a 20-week sentence suspended for two years at Southwark Crown Court (pictured). He was also told to pay £1,000 costs and carry out 200 hours of unpaid work

‘The claimant maintains 
that consent is something of a red herring in the context of this case. 
It is an essential part of the offence of misfeasance in a public office
 that the victim of the misfeasance has not [consented].’

She added that an expert had concluded that the woman had not been ‘capable’ of consent at the time of the incident.

The
 police claim no unlawful act took place because the woman had consented
 to the sexual act - and that the force is not liable for PC Formby’s 
actions because he was on a ‘mission of his own’.

PC
 Formby was given a 20-week sentence suspended for two years at 
Southwark Crown Court. He was also told to pay £1,000 costs and carry 
out 200 hours of unpaid work.

A
 Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline before the hearing began 
today: ‘The officer pleaded guilty at court and has been dismissed from 
the Metropolitan Police Service.

‘We
 are aware of a civil action being taken against the Metropolitan Police
 Service, due to commence at Central London county court on March 24 
[today]. We will be defending this action.’

The hearing is due to last four days at Central London County Court. The case continues.
