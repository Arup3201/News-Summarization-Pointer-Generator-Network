This is the extraordinary moment that Hillary Clinton's security staff got into an argument with a traffic warden after he issued her car with a parking ticket.

The Westminster City Council warden put an £80 penalty notice on the former US secretary of state’s silver Mercedes vehicle in Central London while she was attending an event at Chatham House.

The row was caught on camera on Saturday by photographer Greg Brennan, who said five of her guards were waiting inside a Mercedes van next to her car at the time because it was raining.

She had earlier arrived in a motorcade of five cars with around 10 security agents, Mr Brennan told MailOnline. Her car was parked in a bay on St James's Square in Mayfair, which costs £3.30 per hour.

The warden then arrived and put a ticket on the car which had transported 65-year-old Mrs Clinton to the event, prompting her security detail to jump out of the van in protest, Mr Brennan said.

The photographer claimed he saw one of the agents angrily waving his arms and flashing his badge to the warden, who remained unflustered and continued to issue the ticket to Mrs Clinton’s vehicle.

Cllr Daniel Astaire, Westminster City Council cabinet member for business, told MailOnline: 'Despite our traffic marshal being questioned by the secret service for just doing his job, he was in the right.

'The former US Secretary of State was parked for nearly 45 minutes without paying. I’m sure she will understand that we have to be fair to everyone, regardless of their status on the world stage.

'For future reference, Mrs Clinton 
can now also download a parking app for her iPhone which will tell her 
in real time where a parking space is in the City of Westminster.'

Feud: The extraordinary row kicked off as a warden tried to put a ticket on Hillary Clinton's car in London

The parking ticket came with an £80 fine
 - but would only be £40 if paid within 14 days. The fine has not yet 
been paid - but an appeal could be launched at any date before October 
25.

Diplomats in London have racked up £70million in unpaid congestion charge fines.

Over the past ten years foreign embassies have accumulated more than 600,000 penalty charge notices after refusing to pay the charge, Transport for London said in May.

Embassies now owe £70,068,175 - with the US topping the list. Over the past ten years, America has picked up 66,372 penalty charge notices totalling £7.5million.

The charge, which brings in around £110million a year, costs £10 and is active in certain areas of London from 7am to 6pm on weekdays.

It was claimed in 2011 that London Mayor Boris Johnson asked US President Barack Obama for a £5million cheque for unpaid congestion charge fines, but the US ambassador intervened before Mr Obama could answer.

A
 spokesman for Mrs Clinton - who does not enjoy diplomatic status or numberplates - has not yet responded to a comment request, and nobody at the US Embassy press office could be 
reached when attempts were made yesterday.

Federal law requires the Secret Service to watch over former presidents and their spouses - and Mrs Clinton's senior staff included up to eight senior state department or National Security Council officials while she was secretary of state.

London Evening Standard editor Sarah Sands said on Twitter today: 'The role of London traffic wardens in the Special Relationship. We honour Hillary Clinton - then give her a parking ticket.'

The politician - the wife of ex-president Bill, 67, and mother of Chelsea, 33 - was at
 Chatham House to collect a prize for her contribution to international 
diplomacy. She and her husband have an estimated net worth of £35million.

She spoke at the event to a newspaper, calling for a ‘sensible adult conversation’ about the boundaries of state surveillance after the leaking of files by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Mrs Clinton said it would be ‘going down a wrong path’ to reject a debate following disclosures about the collection of communications data by GCHQ and America's National Security Agency.

Later that evening, she posted a tweet to British foreign secretary William Hague, saying: 'Great seeing you today. I'm so pleased that our special relationship continues even after leaving office.'

Mrs Clinton, who was born in 1947 in Chicago, Illinois, is currently considering whether to make her second challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.

She received the prize for her ‘significant and impressive contribution to international diplomacy’ and ‘her work on behalf of gender equality and opportunities for women and girls’.

Last night, Sir Elton John honoured Mrs Clinton for her work to help those affected by HIV/AIDS, at an annual event for his Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York City.

She was excited as she accepted the first founders award from him, but told the crowd at Cipriani's restaurant that 'we still have so far to go' when it comes to helping those affected by HIV/AIDS.
