First look: Coronation Street actress-turned-designer Michelle Keegan has unveiled her fifth range for Lipsy, which lands on Thursday, and has given FEMAIL an exclusive sneak peek 

Speaking to MailOnline about the latest drop, she said: 'This is my fifth collection for Lipsy and it includes classic favourites of mine that I have reworked using Spring/Summer's hottest trends and colours, as well as some brand new looks I hope everyone will love just as much as I do.'

There's plenty of the flattering bodycons that Michelle loves to wear, as well as bright new colourways for the warmer months.

'This is my debut Spring collection,' she explained. 'It's such a fun time in fashion. I loved introducing new styles that are guaranteed to get you excited about the new season. I loved injecting flashes of fluro pink for the first time as well.'

Hard work: Michelle says despite how busy she has been, she always make space in her schedule to fit in design and fitting time with Lipsy to ensure that the collections are the best that they can be

The star, who found fame on Coronation Street, has been extremely busy recently. Not only has she been in the Dominican Republic doing a photoshoot, but she's been filming for a new drama, too.

'There’s always time for fashion,' the dedicated designer said of her hectic schedule.

'I’m fortunate that it doesn’t feel like work. I always make space in my schedule to fit in design and fitting time with Lipsy to ensure that the collections are the best that they can be. 

'Even if it means jumping on a train and getting there on Sundays.'

Busy lady: As well as tying the knot, Michelle has got big plans careerwise for 2015

While they are keeping the exact date of their big day under wraps, Michelle insists everything is on track. 

As well as getting married, Michelle has clearly got big plans careerwise for 2015.

She teased: 'I’ve always been interested in fashion so when I got the chance to launch my own collection I jumped at the opportunity. 

'It’s definitely something I’d like to continue to pursue in the future. However, there are a number of new challenges which will also be taking place next year.'
