A man who had sex with a performing dolphin at an amusement park in the 1970s has claimed the encounter took place because the animal seduced him.

Malcolm Brenner, 63, claims that he fell for Dolly, a bottlenose dolphin who lived at the now-defunct Floridaland theme park in Sarasota, after her amorous advances.

Brenner told the story of their year-long affair relationship again in Dolphin Love, a new film which premiered last week at the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.

Slamdance, which takes place at the same time as the more famous Sundance film festival, is seen as its edgier alternative and hosts more niche films.

Dolphin Lover: Malcolm Brenner, (left in 2014 and right in 1971 with Dolly) has admitted pursuing a sexual relationship with a bottlenose dolphin in 1970s Florida

'I started rubbing her': In new film, Dolphin Lover, which premiered this week, Brenner discusses his taboo relationship

Sneaking off: Brenner has previously described how he was trusted to be alone with the dolphins, and waited until after nightfall to have sex with Dolly

In the fifteen-minute video, Brenner tells the cameras: 'I started rubbing her along her back, working my way to her flukes – her tail.

'And as I was rubbing her and moving my hand towards her tail, Dolly was slowly rolling around her long axis.'

According to Fusion, Brenner went on to describe the sex in even more detail, while an 'animated interpretation' of the encounter was played.

In previous interviews about this encounter, which he also turned into a novel called Wet Goddess, Brenner has claimed the relationship was consensual. The relationship reportedly lasted a year.

Last year he told Britain's Daily Mirror: 'There's something quite transcendental about making love with a dolphin.

'The dolphin is very aware, the dolphin is an intelligent and creative creature and making love is a consummate act.'

He added that their courtship began when Dolly 'announced her intentions to me by positioning herself so I was rubbing against her.'

He then detailed how he was often left alone with Dolly and the other dolphins, whom he was photographing at the time.

This allowed him to sneak off with her after closing time to have sex.

In another interview, Brenner said: 'It's like being with a tiger or a bear. This is an animal that could kill you in two seconds if it wanted to.' 

According to Brenner's blog, the screening of the film was 'well-received' by its initial audience, and nobody walked out.

In a personal verdict on the film, he describes the sex animation as 'beautiful'. He also says it is 'oddly accurate, without being graphic or vulgar.'

Defunct: The park no longer exists, but used to offer sealife shows, as well as steamboat trips such as the one shown above

He also reveals that some animators turned down the project once they discovered the controversial content of the film.

Brenner's acts would be illegal today. But Florida only enacted a law banning bestiality in 2011, so the encounter he described in 1971 would not be covered.

Filmmakers Kareem Tabsch and Joey Daoud have defended their film's content, say that Brenner's experience is 'unique' and an 'appealing' subject for a documentary.

They told the Miami New Times: 'However uncomfortable it can be as a subject matter, what Malcolm experienced is unique and very real and very serious to him.

'He is a member of a community (zoophiles) who live on the outermost fringes of society.

'Their reality is something most of us can not comprehend, relate to or know much about- all of that makes it all the more appealing to me as a subject to tackle.'

While Brenner's experience is undoubtedly out of the ordinary, there are other recorded incidents of dolphins having sex with humans - or at least trying to.

One well-documented case involves a female scientist who started having sex with a dolphin in the 1960s as part of a Nasa experiment to try to teach the creatures to speak English.

Margaret Howe Lovatt was stationed in a flooded house in the U.S. Virgin Isles in 1963, where she was tasked with trying to teach an adolescent dolphin called Peter.

'Precious and gentle': Margaret Howe Lovatt, who had sex with a dolphin called Peter, above, in 1963, has also opened up about her relationship

At first she let Peter relieve his urges with female dolphins kept nearby - but later claimed it helped the experiment to let him have sex with her, instead.

In a BBC film about the relationship, she said: 'Peter liked to be... with me. He would rub himself on my knee, my foot or my hand and I allowed that.

'I wasn't uncomfortable - as long as it wasn't too rough... It was just easier to incorporate that and let it happen, it was very precious and very gentle, Peter was right there, he knew that I was right there.'

'It was sexual on his part - it was not sexual on mine, sensuous perhaps... I was there to get to know Peter, that was part of Peter.' 

Dolphins also often target their advances on humans who have no interest in reciprocating.

Several tourists at dolphin swimming events have been leaped on and mounted by aroused dolphins, often to the amusement of onlookers, whose videos of the events have gained significant attention.

However, the dangers of an advance can in some situations be very real, given the strength and size of dolphins, who often weigh more than 400lbs.

In 2002, swimmers on the English coast were warned of a dolphin which tried to attack a series of female swimmers in the sea by encircling them and isolating them from their companions.
