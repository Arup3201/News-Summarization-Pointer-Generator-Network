There is no bigger celebrity at Brazil 2014 than Cristiano Ronaldo, and on Sunday he goes into the jungle hoping to avoid the fate already suffered by both England and Spain - elimination after just two matches.

At 29, the FIFA World Player of the Year faces the United States in the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus knowing this is his greatest chance to dominate a finals. But his time in Brazil so far has been a mixture of bizarre sideshows and constant injury concerns.

When he arrived at the luxurious Royal Palms hotel in Caminas just outside Sao Paulo 11 days ago he was greeted by around 1,000 fans, a man dressed in a Donald Duck costume and a topless model.

‘Ronaldo Duck’ was wearing a  Portugal No 7 shirt and the model was wearing only a coat of patriotic Portuguese red and green paint - the circus had well and truly begun.

The topless welcome to Portugal’s base camp had come from Brazilian former ‘Miss Bumbum’, beauty contest winner Andressa Urach, who has claimed in the past to have had an affair with Ronaldo - strenuously denied by the player.

Six days later she was ejected from Portugal’s public training session at Ponte Preta’s Moises Lucarelli stadium and told to stay away from the Real Madrid star.

Meanwhile, USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann has claimed his players must 'put Cristiano Ronaldo in his place' if they are to secure qualification from Group G ahead of Thursday’s final group game with Germany.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Klinsmann said: 'There’s a lot of admiration for him and for the players who play at big clubs and in the Champions League,' Klinsmann said.

'But this is the moment to prove yourself, to step up, play those guys and put them in their place. We want to put Cristiano in his place.

'We want to make it our game, we are ready for that, and we have been preparing for that for a long time.

Ronaldo’s presence in Brazil has captured the imagination of Campinas, the third largest city in Sao Paulo state. And waving to the 8,000 supporters packed into the Brazilian second division club’s ground on Wednesday, he seemed to be enjoying the attention.

But he and his team-mates are less happy about the constant speculation over his fitness.

Asked if the Portuguese players were sick of questions about Ronaldo’s physical condition, striker Helder Postiga replied: ‘Yes, but if I am tired of hearing the questions every day then you can imagine how it is for him. I think the talk is too much. He has been training at maximum and that is all there is to say.’

As he prepares to face the United States, the signals remain contradictory. ‘Ronaldo always finishes the training and then puts ice on his knee but there are normally about 10 players doing the same so it is nothing unusual,’ said Postiga.

But while his Portuguese team-mates have lined up this week to repeat the mantra ‘Ronaldo is 100 per cent’, Portuguese doctors confirmed before the tournament that he has a problem with his left knee, and it will require rest as soon as the World Cup ends.

And for all that Postiga claims the post-match ice treatment is normal, Ronaldo is the only player who walks off the pitch with a sizeable ice-pack already strapped to his knee. If Portugal are knocked out tonight, Real Madrid want Ronaldo to cut short his World Cup and begin a prolonged period of rest so that he is ready for next season.

The Ballon d’Or winner was troubled by an inflamed tendon in the final third of last season and was advised by Real Madrid doctors that he should rest as much as possible between then and the end of the campaign or risk missing the World Cup.

He sat out matches against Real Sociedad, Almeria and Celta Vigo in La Liga as well as missing the Spanish Cup final against Barcelona and the second leg of Real Madrid’s Champions League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund.

He managed to play in the Champions League final but club coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted he did so while being less than 100 per cent. He trained again in Manaus on Saturday with a light strapping on his left leg.

Portugal coach Paulo Bento has other injury problems, with striker Hugo Almeida, goalkeeper Rui Patricio and Fabio Coentrao all out and Pepe missing today’s game through suspension.

Their performance in their opening game against Germany did little to shift the attention away from the Ronaldo soap opera as a 4-0 defeat left Germany top of Group G and Portugal bottom.

The heavy loss has left them needing to win their two remaining games to be sure of progressing beyond the group stages of the World Cup.

An early exit will be disastrous for Ronaldo’s personal quest to justify the ‘best player in the world’ tag he finally earned when he won the Ballon d’Or last January.

It was his brilliant four-goal salvo against Sweden in the play-offs that made sure he won the vote ahead of Franck  Ribery and it also meant that he had  single-handedly secured Portugal’s passage to Brazil.

After facing the United States in the tropical heat of Manaus, Bento’s team come up against Ghana on Thursday in Brasilia. They have not played two games of this importance since that double-header with Sweden and Ronaldo knows keeping Portugal in the competition beyond the group stage will also help him make it back to the podium for the World Player award next January.

‘When we have these decisive games we always respond. I hope that it will be like the Sweden matches,’ said Postiga. ‘We need to show the same spirit that got us here.’

As Ronaldo’s closest ally in the Portugal camp, he knows better than anyone that what really got Portugal to Brazil was Ronaldo at his best. ‘He is such an important player for us,’ he said. ‘We know he is the one who can really make the difference for us.’

There are times when it seems, much as with England circa 2002 with David Beckham, that other players in the squad are rather tired of the showbiz baggage that accompanies them because of the global standing of their best player.

Beyond Real Madrid pals Fabio Coentrao and Pepe, and Postiga, who looks set to start up front with him against USA, affection towards Ronaldo is never hugely in evidence as Portugal are put through their paces.

But his team-mates know they would not be in Brazil without him and that victory against Jurgen Klinsmann’s USA team depends largely on whether he can recapture his early-season form and do to the Americans what he did to Sweden in November.
