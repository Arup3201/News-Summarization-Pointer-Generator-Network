‘The big man is back in town,’ so Christian Benteke did not say on his first appearance in a match for Aston Villa in six months.

Wayne Rooney’s famous utterance at the 2006 World Cup is far removed from words that might fall from the Belgium striker’s lips, even if it feels that way for Paul Lambert.

Benteke is a quieter soul, the kind who broke the news to friends and family that he would miss a potentially career-defining tournament in Brazil this summer with telephone calls conducted in calm tones.

It was April 3 when he shaped to shoot during a training session at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training complex and instead crumpled to the floor in agony, not knowing exactly what had afflicted him.

By the time he picked up his mobile he was aware it would be at least half a year before he could contemplate prowling the pitch again. Had he not worked so hard, treating his physiotherapy with Villa’s medical staff so seriously, during his lay-off it could have been longer.

But the boots came on in earnest against Bolton Wanderers for Villa’s Under-21s game on Monday afternoon – six months to the day since his last match, a 4-1 defeat at Old Trafford.

It was another step on the road to full recovery, which still carries potential for peaks and troughs. He scored a penalty, set up a chance for Jores Okore, and lasted 63 minutes before being substituted.

Lambert, enthused about the return of his best player, will contemplate naming him on the bench for the visit of Manchester City on Saturday. If not to play, it will provide Benteke and his teammates with a psychological boost. His presence is such it can lift a performance and he would benefit from a matchday atmosphere.

It may still be another month before he is able to complete 90 minutes to full effect and Villa fans must be patient. But the statistics show his importance.

Since Benteke signed from Genk in 2012 he has scored 34 goals in 67 appearances. With him, Villa win 30 per cent of games, that figure is 26 per cent without him. Possession, passing accuracy, and crosses per game all increase by fractions too when he plays.

But it is his offensive impact in this altered Villa side that should be felt greatest. Successive 3-0 defeats to Arsenal and Chelsea should not cloud the fact this team remains significantly stronger in defence that the one Benteke departed.

Villa collected 10 points from their first four Premier Leauge games off the back of just six shots on target and four goals. Benteke will advance those numbers.

The Belgian international was back in training this week at Bodymoor Heath, Aston Villa's training ground

There are 8.7 shots per game when he plays, compared to 6.7 when he doesn’t, and 1.2 goals scored per game, compared to 0.8 when he doesn’t.

That is the difference between another season struggling against relegation and a first campaign in four years where the threat of the drop doesn’t feature.

Lambert must be thankful this troublesome injury, the same which kept Charles N’Zogbia out for the entirety of last season, has denied Benteke the chance of competitive action for a relatively short time.

Even if he does not feature until the trip to Everton on October 18, after the international break, Benteke will have missed just 14 Premier League games for Villa. Being unable to represent Belgium in Brazil will have hurt deeply but it enabled him to join his club on the pre-season tour of Texas in July and focus on recovering during the summer.

Mark Leather, head of sport development at Bolton and former head physiotherapist at Liverpool, believes Benteke and Villa deserve credit for the timing of his return but explains how the injury still needs to be closely monitored.

‘Achilles tendons are notoriously quite complex to rehabilitate, the outcomes are not consistent as with other injuries,’ says Leather. ‘There are more peaks and troughs in the rehab journey than ligament reconstructions or fractures.

‘The tendon is an extension of three big muscles in calf and is key in the ability to push off and accelerate into air. That puts it under immense strain.

‘It’s a good recovery time, not rushing him back too quickly. Benteke will be raring to go but this is the next stage of what is a very long process.

‘The chance of re-rupturing is very slim. But you only know what will happen with games. For the next month to six weeks there will be a grey area, with the medical team assessing how he is coping.’

Benteke’s left foot felt fine after his match against Leather’s team. Fine will do for Lambert, pleased his big man is back in town.

Wolves missed the chance to top the Championship by losing to Huddersfield on Wednesday night. But it remains a fine stat after 10 games for three teams of the Midlands. Nottingham Forest sit second as things stand and Derby fourth. Wolves are now seventh. We have four teams from the region in the Premier League and that number could swell come May.

Peter Crouch looked like the fall guy in Mark Hughes’s evolution of Stoke City as focus shifted to pace and quick passing. But the former England player still possesses required quality at 33 to contribute in moves and has shown that a striker of substance is needed to convert style into points. Two goals in two games and his understanding with Victor Moses is promising.
