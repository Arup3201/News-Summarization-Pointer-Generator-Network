With its incredible presentation, near-prefect controls and life-like animation, it’s hard to find anything wrong with NBA 2K14.

And although it’s not radically different from the previous game, key gameplay mechanics have been tweaked to make the experience as enjoyable as possible.

Court in the act: everything from the animation to the way each player looks is right on the money

Perhaps most impressive is how 2K Sports have captured the feel of the sport. Fast breaks are easier to execute than ever before, while showboating Assist Passes (achieved by a tap of the right and left triggers) means no game is without flair. Play-calling, achieved via the D-Pad, is a breeze, too, allowing you to change tactics on the fly.

There are also plenty of dribble moves – with an impressive amount of combinations available at the touch of the right analogue stick. 

Thankfully, they don’t always work, and pulling them off at the wrong moment will often result in a turnover.

Shooting from deep is as rewarding as ever, made even more so by just how well-realised the players are. Many of the most famous stars have made a seamless transition to the game – from pixel-perfect expressions, to their shot technique.

Three points! Shooting isn't easy, but it's not so hard as to put you off trying your luck from distance

Sadly, although the game looks incredible in motion, cut-scenes do not have the same level of polish.

Characters have a ‘dead-behind-the-eyes’ look about them, and uncomfortably jolt around. Given the high-quality of the presentation – from the outstanding commentary to glitzy game menus and impeccable soundtrack – it’s a shame such an integral part of the game isn’t quite up to scratch.

Thankfully, this blip can’t take away from the wide selection of game modes on offer. The standard pick-up-and-play matches, multi-season and multiplayer feature but it’s the LeBron: Path to Greatness, that takes centre stage.

In similar vein to NBA 2K12’s Jordan Challenge, you take control of LeBron James and take part in a series of key games across several seasons.

So close but so far: If only the cutscenes had more polish, then this could be the perfect sports game. There is still hope, though, when the game is released on next-gen consoles

You can choose either the Heat Dynasty – where James must help Miami become a dominant force in the league, or the Fantastic Journey – that sees the star hop around different teams. It’s a worthy addition, but one many won't find as fun as the Jordan Challenge.

No matter, because for the most part, NBA 2K14 is a slam-dunking success.

NBA 2K14 is out now.

Fantastic gameplay that captures the feel and flair of the sport

Plenty of game modes - including the enjoyable LeBron: Path to Greatness

Sadly, Path to Greatness is not as fun as NBA 2K12's Jordan Challenge

For those after the best visual package, you'll have to wait for next-gen
