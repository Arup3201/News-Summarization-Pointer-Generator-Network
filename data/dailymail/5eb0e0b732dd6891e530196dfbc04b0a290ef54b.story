YouTube star Zoella has announced she is quitting the internet after admitting she used a ghostwriter for her best-selling novel Girl Online.

The vlogger, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, posted a message on Twitter today to her fans saying she was taking a few days off the internet 'because it's clouding up my brain'.

This comes after it emerged that the editorial team at Penguin helped her with the writing, particularly award-winning author Siobhan Curran.

Her boyfriend, fellow vlogger Alfie Deyes, announced he would also be taking a break as the couple have been so busy.

Publishers Penguin has said Zoe 'Zoella' Sugg, 24, 'did not write the book Girl Online on her own,' but did not confirm that the sales success was ghostwritten

The vlogger, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, posted a message on Twitter today to her fans saying she was taking a few days off the internet 'because it's clouding up my brain'

'Just to let you know :) Zoë and I are going to take a few days out of daily vlogging to have some time to our selves,' he tweeted. 

'We've both been so busy recently working on different things so a little break will do us good as we haven't spent proper time together.' 

After mounting speculation, Miss Sugg released a statement yesterday saying that only 'the story and the characters' were her own work. 

The 24-year-old announced her departure to her 2.6million followers,  saying: 'Bare with me on vlogmas. I'm taking a few days out and off the internet because it's clouding up my brain. Thanks for understanding.'

Her tweet was favourited more than 9,000 times and prompted thousands of messages of support from her fans. 

Kareen McAulay said: 'Okay zoe. Hope you feel better after a wee break.'

Zoe Sugg's boyfriend, fellow vlogger Alfie Deyes, pictured left with Zoe, announced he would also be taking a break as the couple have been so busy. Girl Online sold nearly 80,000 copies in its first seven days

Pauline @TheLifeParadise tweeted: 'Why do you only take the negativity zoe? You shouldnt even think about them.People are jealous. Look at the positive, all the love.'

Girl Online broke the all-time record for highest first-week sales for a debut author, selling 78,109 copies in its first seven days. 

The figure is more than five times higher than the number of copies which were sold of EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey in its first week. 

As rumours started to spread about a possible ghostwriter, Penguin confirmed that Sugg did not write Girl Online on her own.

'To be factually accurate, you would need to say Zoe Sugg did not write the book Girl Online on her own,' a penguin spokesperson told the Sunday Times, adding that despite this, the story is very much Miss Sugg's work.  

The firm said in a statement: 'As publishers our role is, and always has been, to find the very best talent and help them tell their story and connect them with readers.

'Talented YouTube entrepreneurs such as Zoe are brilliant at understanding and entertaining their audience.

'For her first novel, Girl Online, Zoe has worked with an expert editorial team to help her bring to life her characters and experiences in a heartwarming and compelling story.'

Zoella responded by writing on Twitter: 'Thanks for all the positive feedback about Girl Online and for the doubters out there, of course I was going to have help from Penguin's editorial team in telling my story, which I talked about from the beginning.

'Everyone needs help when they try something new. The story and the characters of Girl Online are mine. I want to thank all of you who have taken time to support the book.' 

Ms Sugg's 'vlog' has 12 million viewers a month while an estimated two million people follower her on Twitter

Girl Online's acknowledgements thanks 'everyone at Penguin for helping me put together my first novel, especially Amy Alward and Siobhan Curham, who were with me every step of the way.'

The former, Ms Alward, is Zoella's editor, the latter, Siobham Curham, is a freelance writer and the author of several young adult novels.

A since deleted post on Ms Curham's blog allegedly read that she had been approached with writing a novel in six weeks, and finished the task, 80,000 words, in August.

MailOnline has reached out to Ms Curham for comment.

Zoella's 'vlogs', short for video blogs, attract 12 million hits each month. She began posting the videos in 2009 as a 'creative outlet'. She now has six million followers on YouTube and is read by more than 2.5 million on Twitter.

Penguin Random House, the publisher behind Girl Online, agreed to sign Zoella after its CEO Tom Weldon was told by his 13-year-old goddaughter that the book would be 'a huge best-seller'.

Miss Sugg was also an unlikely addition to Band Aid 30 where she joined Bob Geldof and One Direction for the charity single. She also featured in the November issue of Vogue.

Of the record-breaking achievement, Miss Sugg said: 'It's such an amazing feeling. I'm so grateful to everyone who has bought a copy of Girl Online. I love that so many of my viewers are enjoying the book! This year has been so exciting and this for sure is the icing on the cake.'
