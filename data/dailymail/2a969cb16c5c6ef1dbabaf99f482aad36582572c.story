A college basketball star who was found dead in her dorm room in January died from a blood cell disorder, not from choking on gum in her sleep, as police first believed.

The Washington County coroner announced Shanice Clark's cause of death on Monday, nearly two months after the 21-year-old was found inside her room at California University of Pennsylvania.

She was found unresponsive at 3.03am on January 18. She was rushed to Monongahela Valley Hospital but she could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 4.10am.

California borough police said that a preliminary report from medical personnel indicated the death appeared to be accidental and there were suggestions she had choked on gum.

Tragedy: Shanice Clark, 21, was found unresponsive in her dorm room at California University of Pennsylvania, where she played basketball, in January. She passed away from a blood cell disorder

But Coroner Tim Warco blamed it on sickle cell trait, a blood cell disorder that often does not have any symptoms but can lead to sudden death in extremely rare cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

University officials said they were 'deeply saddened' by the death of the 6-foot senior forward, who had played two dozen games for the Vulcans last season.  

Athletic director Karen Hjerpe called Clark 'a bright student and talented player' and said 'her smile and personality will be missed'.

Clark, a communications major, had hoped to become a broadcaster and chose the school because of its good facilities after transferring from Santa Fe College in Florida.

But friend Cleveland Clunis told the Toronto Star that she would often joke that she had gone to the university for a different reason.

'For Shanice, it was, "There's a good hairstylist",' said Clunis, the founder of a non-profit basketball program she had attended. 'When she shares that with you, you can't help but laugh.'

He said that this sense of humor had made her popular among students and staff.

'She could start a conversation with you from morning and still have you laughing and interested till sundown,' he said.

Geraldine M. Jones, interim university president, said in a statement after her death: 'Our thoughts today are with the family of Shanice Clark, a senior from Ontario, Canada, who passed away early this morning.

'On behalf of California University of Pennsylvania, I extend my deepest sympathy to all of Shanice's family and friends. She will be missed by her teammates and coaches, her classmates, and by the entire campus community.'

Clark left behind her mother, Kashaeka Fearon, and a younger sister.

Sickle cell trait means someone is carrying a gene for a serious condition called sickle cell disease, which can cause red blood cells to change their shapes, potentially causing pain and infections.

If someone has sickle cell trait, it does not mean they have sickle cell disease. Instead, they are a carrier of the trait and can pass it on to their children. If they were to have children with someone else carrying the trait, that child has a 25 per cent chance of being born with sickle cell disease.

People with sickle cell trait have red blood cells with abnormal hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs and returns carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs) but they have enough normal hemoglobin for red cells to successfully carry oxygen around the body.

While it is extremely rare for sickle cell trait to cause any complications, there can be problems in conditions of severe physical stress, including low oxygen conditions, severe dehydration, severe physical exercise or very high altitude. In these situations, cells can change their shapes, causing pain and further complications.

Sickle cell trait, which is more commonly found in African-Americans than other races, is diagnosed with a simple blood test. Couples planning to have children may want to find out if they have the trait to see if their kids might inherit sickle cell disease.
