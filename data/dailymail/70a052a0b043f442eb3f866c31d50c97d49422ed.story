Banks including Lloyds and RBS have come under fire for their treatment of small businesses

Banks including RBS and Lloyds have again come under fire over their treatment of small businesses.

It has emerged many put firms into high-interest fixed-rate loans then charged them huge fees to switch when interest rates plummeted.

MPs are stepping up pressure on high street lenders, urging them to review their sales of the loans, which have trapped thousands of businesses in poor deals.

Members of the Treasury Committee are said to be 'furious' the City watchdog failed to protect these small firms.

Banks have already paid £1.8billion in compensation for mis-sold 'interest rate swaps', meant to protect firms if interest rates rose. When rates fell to record lows many companies were hit with huge 'breakage' penalties if they wanted to switch deals.

More than 14,000 small businesses received compensation.

But fixed-rate loans and tailored business loans – the centre of the latest row – are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, meaning customers mis-sold them are not eligible for compensation.

The FCA says such loans can also saddle businesses with huge switching fees. Some have an interest rate swap buried in the contract, but even the more basic loans can come with huge unpredictable break penalties.

According to the Treasury Committee, fixed-rate loans and tailored business loans can be just as dangerous as interest rate swaps.

It has emerged 60,000 firms were sold these loans – about half by Lloyds, around 11,000 from RBS, and 11,272 by Clydesdale Bank.

In a damning report earlier this month into the treatment of small firms by banks, the Treasury Committee said it had received evidence Clydesdale Bank mis-sold tailored business loans.

It said the lender engineered the products so the interest rate swap was buried in the loan – meaning it fell outside the FCA's remit. Firms were hit with penalties of up to 40 per cent of the value of the loan if they wanted to terminate their contract.

Last night Mark Garnier, a Conservative member of the Treasury Committee, said: 'We are furious with the regulator for not picking this up. The FCA is walking away from its moral responsibility, if not its legal duty, to protect consumers.'

He added: 'Banks need to demonstrate they have changed – and voluntarily resolving this issue would help to resolve that.'

RBS said it is trawling through its sales of fixed-rate loans.

Lloyds said its fixed-rate loans were 'fundamentally different' to the tailored business loans sold by Clydesdale Bank, with lower break costs.
