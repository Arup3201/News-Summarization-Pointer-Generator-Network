Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has said he will not leave the BBC show without a fight - and is already considering a new show based around farming.

Clarkson is said to be in discussions with Andy Williams, his long standing collaborator and Top Gear's executive producer, to star in a new farming show - just days after he launched into an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala.

Speculation is mounting over what will happen to one of the BBC's biggest stars when his fate is finally decided at a meeting this week.

He told the Sunday Mirror today that he has been 'put on silence' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations he punched Oisin Tymon, a 36-year-old Top Gear producer, in a row over the lack of catering.

Clarkson told the paper: 'I've been put on silence. There are very good reasons from my point of view why I simply can't say a word.'

His future at the BBC is to be decided next week when the corporation's internal probe into his 'fracas' with Mr Tymon is put before Director-General Tony Hall.

But sources close to the presenter told the paper that if he is sacked he will probably sue for wrongful dismissal. 

They said he is still 'fuming' about the top BBC boss who allegedly compared his situation to paedophile Jimmy Savile's - and  has vowed to find out who it was.

An insider said Clarkson thinks BBC bosses have launched a smear campaign against him and he 'won't let that go'.

The paper also revealed that the BBC are already filming the pilot of an alternative motoring show called 'The Getaway'.

The Sunday Times has reported that Clarkson is already considering a change in direction - and may become the face of a new documentary series on farming.

The paper reports Clarkson originally took the idea to then BBC director General George Entwistle in 2012 but it did not get the go-ahead.

But following the now infamous fracas and the uncertainty surrounding his current job, Clarkson it said to be preparing a new proposal for the show. 

A source told the paper: 'In the last week Jeremy has had a chance to firm it up. It's about trying to run a farm when you don't know anything about farming and getting things wrong... in a Top Gear-esque way.' 

In 2012, Clarkson told the Radio Times: 'I love the idea of being a farmer, that's why I like watching Adam's Farm [on Countryfile]. But farming land is complex. It's a business, but it's important to me that the land looks beautiful too.'
