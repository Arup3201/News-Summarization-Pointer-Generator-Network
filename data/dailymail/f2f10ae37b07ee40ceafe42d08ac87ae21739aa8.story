Robbery: Margaret Mosley used her weight to pin 
Richard O’Brien to the ground as co-defendant Marcus Davies 
rifled through the OAP’s pockets

An obese woman deliberately sat on a frail pensioner before she and an accomplice robbed him of more than £450, a judge has heard.

Margaret Mosley used her weight to pin Richard O’Brien to the ground as younger co-defendant Marcus Davies rifled through the OAP’s pockets.

Mosley was 'highly intoxicated' when she sat on on elderly Mr O’Brien’s lap and fell off but the incident was to be the start of a darker turn for the OAP, the court heard.

Her friend Davies, 29, pushed Mr O’Brien from his chair and punched the frail man while heartless Mosley pinned him to the floor, in October last year.

Davies then went through his pockets, stealing £450 in cash and aiming one last kick at his victim before fleeing the Yates bar, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

Mosley was still at the scene when police arrived but pretended to be a witness, initially fooling officers as the victim was himself so drunk he said his attackers were two black men.

Detectives were only able to piece together the details of the remarkable brawl by watching footage recorded on the pub’s CCTV cameras

Mosley, who was charged with one count of robbery, was handed a 10 month sentence, suspended for a year-and-a-half and an 18 month supervision order by Mr Recorder Raj Persaud at Reading Crown Court.

Mr Recorder Persaud said: 'I don’t regard you as being the prime mover in this offence, I can see from the CCTV the part that drink played in the commission of this offence.

'This was highly opportunistic and your involvement came after Mr Davies had pushed Mr O’Brien to the ground.

'I note that the use of force was minimal and you played a secondary role.

'It’s a serious matter that crosses the custody threshold.'

The trio were all drinking heavily together at Yates when plump, grey-haired Mosley sat heavily on Mr O’Brien’s lap and fell to the floor, on October 5, 2011.

However, the farcical scene turned ugly when she ganged up on the older man with Davies, pinning him to the floor as her cruel accomplice launched the violent attack.

However, while Davies fled she stayed at the pub surrounded by other drinkers and when police arrived claimed to be an eye witness to the robbery.

Victim Mr O’Brien’s account was so garbled officers initially took a statement from Mosley, of Chesham, Buckinghamshire, only discovering the true part she played in the crime after reviewing CCTV.

Davies, of High Wycombe, was previously jailed for 20 months for robbery and common assault at Aylesbury Crown Court.
