When it comes to their job, these two are real high-fliers.

Dangling 500ft above the ground, rock climbers David Smith, 32, and Anthony Marshall, 33, are giving a Spring clean to one of Britain's tallest apartment blocks, the Beetham Tower in Manchester.

The landmark 47-story building stands a
 total of 550ft high. At 250ft up there's a bar called Cloud 23 - 
on the 23rd floor - where drinkers hoping to enjoy the best view of the city
get a shock when a sponge covers the skyline.

Window of opportunity: Extreme window cleaners Anthony Marshall and Dave Smith give one of the UK's tallest building a spring clean

The pair had complete a strict abseiling training course before being 
allowed free reign to clean the windows - and take in the breath-taking 
views each morning. It take them two days to complete the task.

Their boss Tony Camilleri, 51, from Salford, who runs Tudor Contract Cleaners, said: 'The lads absolutely love it. It's got to be the best job in window cleaning.

'They aren't running through backyards with a ladder like I was when I started, they're seeing some of the best sights in the country. Not many people get to say they've been up to the top of Wembley Stadium.

'In the summer they go rock climbing. It's their hobby. It's like being a footballer which starts out as your hobby then you get paid for it. So they came to me with their skills and I trained them up and taught them how to clean windows.'

Brushing with death: The 551ft tall Beetham Tower in Manchester City centre, is home to the Cloud 23 bar and the Hilton Hotel

Tudor Contract Cleaners employs 250 staff nationwide and scrubs venues such as Old Trafford, Wembley Stadium and London's St Pancras Station.

Mr Camilleri said he began teaching his staff to abseil when his soldier cousin came back from the Falklands war 25 years ago and asked for a job.

'I asked him ‘what can you do' and he said he could abseil,' Mr Camilleri added. 'That's when I stopped using traditional cradles and started using rope abseils.

'Now we have people wanting to do it the other way round. We have local window cleaners who want to progress in the company and they ask to do abseiling. If they pass the test then they can.

'When the girls in Cloud 23 saw the cleaners on the windows they had a look of shock on their faces. They were saying "oh my God, there's a man outside the window". For the lads to do that I think they should be paying me rather than me paying them.'

But with health and safety rules to comply to, Mr Camilleri  makes sure his men scaling some of the country's biggest landmarks are trained to the highest standard.

'We even need to do health and safety assessments on how to make a cup of tea,' he said. 'That's not even a joke. We go from that to having abseilers on the roof of Beetham Tower.'

The father-of-four decided to clean on his own 30 years ago after managing to pick up a contract for the Portland Hotel in Manchester.

Beetham Tower, one of the tallest buildings in Europe, opened in 2006. Until The Shard, which stands at 1003ft tall, opened in London last year, it was the tallest residential building in Britain.

The space up to floor 22 is occupied by a four-star Hilton Hotel, with the remaining floors let as apartments.

Former Manchester United and Everton footballer Phil Neville recently had an apartment occupying three linked stories on the market for £4million and the tower's designer Ian Simpson owns the top-floor penthouse which even contains an olive garden.
