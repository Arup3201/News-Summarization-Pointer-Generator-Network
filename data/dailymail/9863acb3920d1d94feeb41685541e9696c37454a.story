Facing a new enemy, the White House has instituted new rules in carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria.

Last year, President Obama made a famous speech acknowledging civilian casualties in drone strikes for the first time, saying he would do his best to prevent though needless deaths in the future be instituting a new rule that would only allow attacks if there was a 'near certainty' innocents wouldn't be hurt. 

He called it 'the highest standard we can meet'. 

But apparently that standard has been abandoned in Syria and Iraq, where the U.S. and its allies are now engaged in a fight against the savage terrorist group ISIS.

Innocents: The White House has reportedly relaxed rules on airstrikes in the battle against emerging terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. This new policy was revealed a week after reports that a dozen women and children were killed by an errant Tomahawk missile in the Syrian town of Kfar Daryan.

Not the same: President Obama made a new policy on drone strikes in May 2013, saying he would only allow the attacks if there was a 'near certainty' civilians would not be injured. That policy is allegedly not in place in the latest airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Mr Obama pictured above making the monumental speech at the National Defense University

When Yahoo! News asked if the drone strike policy had changed, following rumors of a dozen civilian deaths in a Syrian town last week, National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Hayden confirmed that the same rules no longer apply.

Hayden said the 'near certainty' standard was created for attacks 'outside areas of active hostilities' which 'simply does not fit what we are seeing on the ground in Iraq and Syria right now.'

The revelation of this latest policy change comes after reports that a dozen civilians were killed by an errant Tomahawk missile in the Syrian village of Kfar Daryan on September 23.

The town in the Iblib province is thought to be a stronghold for the al-Qaeda linked Nusra Front, and U.S. officials allegedly believed that members of the Khorasan terrorist group were there planning attacks.

Mistake: Another view of Kfer Daryan the day after the attacks. A Syrian-backed rebel told the Foreign Affairs Committee late last week that a building for displaced people in the community may have accidentally been targeted

U.S.-backed Syrian rebels told the House Foreign Affairs Committee late last week that women and children were pulled from the rubble of a home for displaced civilians that may have been accidentally targeted in the strike.  

'They were carrying bodies out of the rubble. … I saw seven or eight ambulances coming out of there,' said Abu Abdo Salabman, a political member of one of the Free Syria Army factions, who attended the Foreign Affairs Committee briefing. 'We believe this was a big mistake.'

However, U.S. officials have not yet confirmed the civilian deaths. Hayden said they are investigating the reports. 

It's still unclear who ultimately signs off on the current airstrikes going on in Syria and Iraq, but sources say they've been relaxed and that more power has been given to commanders in the area to approve attacks. 

Following President Obama's policy-changing speech last year, sources at the time reported  that drone strikes would thereafter need presidential approval before being carried out.

But apparently the new policy gives theater commanders more responsibility in selecting targets without as much presidential oversight.
