The man accused of pushing Ki Suk Han to his death on a set of New York City subway tracks allegedly confessed to the crime and revealed how he was watching from the platform as the 58-year-old father was crushed to death by the oncoming train.

'He wouldn’t leave me alone, so I pushed him,' suspect Naeem Davis, 30, told police.

The confession came the same day as Mr Han's widow Semin and their daughter Ashley battled through tears at a press conference, describing how they are haunted by the fact that no one tried to help save him.

Charged: Naeem Davis, 30, was arrested and charged with the murder of Ki-Suk Han, 58, who he allegedly pushed onto the subway tracks when an oncoming car was approaching

Confession: Davis allegedly admitted that he pushed Mr Han onto the tracks after they had an altercation

Victim: Davis admitted that he stayed on the platform and watched as Mr Han (pictured) was crushed to death

News of the confession, reported by The New York Daily News, comes just one day after Davis was arrested and charged with the murder of Mr Han on Monday at the downtown Q platform at the 49th Street platform.

'I saw him get hit by the train,' Davis allegedly told police.

There have been varying reports that there was a dispute between Davis and Mr Han in the moments before the tragic turn.

your m*********ing a** over there, stand in line, wait for the R train, 
that's it.'

The New York Post quoted 'law-enforcement sources' as saying Mr Han had been trying to calm the man down before being attacked.

'He
went up and tried to calm him down, saying, ‘You’re scaring people, The
emotionally disturbed guy just started screaming and cursing, saying, 
‘You don’t know me! You don’t know who I am!’

Now, it is not the verbal back-and-forth that haunts Mr Han's family but the fact that no one on the platform decided to step in and help once they saw the man trying desperately to get off the tracks.

Twenty-year-old Ashley said: ‘It is devastating that he’s no longer here for me.

Support: Semin (right) was joined by her 20-year-old daughter Ashley (left) who spoke about their grief

‘What’s done is done I don’t 
want to dwell on what happened but the thought of somebody helping him 
up in a matter of seconds...it would have been so great.’

She added: ‘I just really wish I had one last chance to tell my dad how much I loved him’.

In
the time since Mr Han’s horrific death, which was caught on camera and 
witnessed by dozens of commuters on the busy subway station at 49th 
Street, the question has been asked again and again: ‘Why did nobody 
help?’

The photo of Mr Han's
last moments, captured by freelance New York Post photographer R. Umar 
Abassi, have sparked outrage and prompted criticism of both Mr Abassi 
for not helping and the paper for plastering the image on their front 
page.

According to family 
pastor Reverend Woon Tae Chon, ‘The family could not sleep after they 
saw these pictures. They have been staying in my house and it has been 
very difficult, very difficult to see them (like this).’

Both
Ashley and her mother Serim, who was married to Mr Han for more than 22
years, bore the physical signs of their bereavement and the tears they 
have shed.

Grisly death: 58-year-old Ki Suk Han was killed by a subway train after being pushed into its path in Times Square on Monday

Tragedy: Flanked by City Comptroller John Liu (left) and their family Rev. Won Tae Cho (right), Semin read something she wrote about her husband of 22-years

Difficult: Mrs Han has been out of work because of a disability for the past two years and Mr Han was searching for a job ever since his business went sour

Mrs Han read from a statement in Korean, her eyes down, her voice catching with grief.  She held a picture of her husband.

Ashley, a junior at Hunter College in Queens, described her father as a man ‘who pursued the American dream’.

She said, ‘That’s what everyone said about my dad. He pushed me to pursue my education.

‘He was not the sort of person who would hesitate to help. He was always there for me.’

Neither
woman addressed the reports that had surfaced earlier suggesting that 
Mr Han and his wife had argued in the hours before he left home for the 
last time. Or that she had called him begging him to come home.

What is clear is that Mr Han was a hardworking man who had fallen on difficult times.

Mr
Han was a successful businessman in Korean who came to New York 25 
years ago in the hope of providing a better life for his future wife and
child.

But two years ago his business foundered and he had been searching for work ever since.

'Nothing he could do': New York Post photographer R Umar Abbasi appeared on the Today show to defend himself and claim he could not have saved Mr Han

Adding to the stress, a disability rendered his wife unable to work, making him more determined to find a job.

Rev
Chon recalled: ‘For one year he visited the church and cleaned it 
although he was unemployed. He said to me, “I will overcome this 
barrier”.

‘Sometimes he was discouraged but just last Sunday after worship he said, “I was encouraged by your sermon.”’

Less than 24 hours later he was killed.

Mr
Han was, according to City Comptroller John Liu, on his way to renew 
his passport and ‘pursue a business opportunity’ in the hope of being 
able to carry on supporting his wife and child.

Mr Liu painted a picture of Mr Han as a ‘hardworking immigrant; a New Yorker in every respect’.

Mr
Liu said: ‘He worked hard to provide food, shelter and clothing for his
family and in the end his life was taken so senselessly’.

There
is some small comfort in the fact that an arrest has been made but, for
the family, their focus falls not on retribution or punishment of the 
perpetrator but on the grief that his apparently mindless act has 
inflicted.

Rev Chon said, ‘We weep over the passing of Mr Han who was a devoted father of Ashley and husband of Serim.’

A
Community fund has been established to assist the family with funeral 
costs, medical care and Ashley’s continued study. The family were joined
at their church by community leaders Mr Chang Hyun Han, President of 
the Korean Community of Greater New York, Mr Kwang Suk Kim, President of
the Korean Community Services and Rev Jong Hoon Kim President of the 
Council Korean Christian Churches of Greater New York.

Terror: The NYPD guard the entrance to the subway in Times Square after a 58-year-old man was pushed on to the tracks by a stranger

Mr
Liu echoed the thoughts of many when he said, ‘I think we all 
comprehend how terrible a tragedy this has been and there are millions 
of people who take the subway every day and what happened to Mr Han was a
horrific thing…all too many New Yorkers could think something like that
might happen to them.’

With
quite dignity Ashley added: ‘We are really grateful for everyone who 
has offered us support. I want to say thank you so much, really’.

Rev
Jong Hoon Kim, said: ‘Mr Han’s family’s grieving is our grieving too. 
Four hundred churches will pray for his family and do our best to 
support them in every way.’
