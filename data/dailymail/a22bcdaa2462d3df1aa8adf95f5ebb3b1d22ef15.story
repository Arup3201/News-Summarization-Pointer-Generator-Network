In its bid to become the tourist destination of the future, the oil-rich nation of Qatar has gone all-out to impress visitors.

And nowhere moreso than at its sleek airport, where the glitzy accessories range from the  beautiful to the somewhat bizarre (yes, it really has an oversized teddy bear lamp at the entrance).

Perhaps the world's most over-the-top airport, Doha's Hamad International has taken extravagance to the next level, with gold-plated coffee kiosks, a life-size replica Formula One car and a sleek hotel offering VIP travellers use of its Presidential Suite for three-hour layovers.

The newly-remodelled Hamad Airport in Doha, Qatar, is easily one of the most luxurious in the world

The terminal itself cost billions to build - and the money is evident in the gold-plated counter of one of the many airport coffee shop

As well as an in-airport hotel, there are also extensive shopping opportunities - both duty-free and luxury offerings

Here's hoping that Qatar, which also won the rights to the FIFA World Cup in 2022, will put on a sporting event even half as spectacular as their airport.

If there was any doubt about the airport's fascination with luxury, head to the 80 stores scattered throughout the terminals - a who's who of designer brands from Armani and Chanel to Hermes and Bulgari.

A mini art gallery has been designed to entertain culture vultures, while the business class lounge measures a huge 33,000 square feet.

Head beyond security and you'll find a luxury hotel, complete with suites for relaxation for travellers who don't feel the need to ever leave the comfort of the terminal.  

The gigantic 1,400-square foot Presidential Suite is of particular note, and to suit quick layovers, can be rented out for as little as three hours.

There's also a restaurant and fitness centre, complete with a spa-inspired indoor pool that overlooks the departing and arriving planes.

Opened to great fanfare last year, Hamad International is said to have cost the oil-rich nation billions to build. 

Among the building's impressive features is Hamad's Airport Hotel, which boasts 100 rooms and suites conveniently located inside the airport itself.

Cat nap! All rooms, like this Superior offering, can be rented for as little as three hours to suit busy travellers

For those looking to indulge, there are boutique offerings from Giorgio Armani (pictured), Harrod's, Hermes and Chanel

As one of the richest countries in the world, the Gulf nation is also home to an impressive gold industry. It's no surprise then that passengers can pick up many styles of the precious metal in the airport's Au Gold Boutique.

With 70 boutique shops available to choose from, Hamad Airport rivals the opulent shopping experience of Heathrow Terminal 5. 

And once you're done browsing, passengers can re-fuel at one of the terminal's 30 restaurants, where everything from American to Italian cuisine is available.

The terminal is home to over 30 restaurants, including Le Grand Comptoir, inspired by traditional French bistros

From American cuisine to Italian pasta, there is something for every taste at the Qatar airport - even caviar

For those with a sweet tooth, the newly-opened Godiva stand offers plenty of chocolate treats to enjoy pre-flight

However, for those who prefer to relax in a lounge setting, look no further than the 33,000-square foot Al Mourjan Business Class Lounge.

There are shower rooms, 'quiet rooms' with beds, meeting rooms, two restaurants, a game room and - proving that kids really do have all the fun - even a children's play room with a full-size replica of a Formula One racing car.

And, of course, in the lounge - as well as the rest of the airport - WiFi is readily available and absolutely free.

The Al Mourjan Business Class Lounge is truly spectacular, and it's spread over 30,000 impressive square feet

Among the amenities is a games room (pictured) and a kids playroom, which even features a life-size replica of a Formula One racing car

There are meeting facilities, nap rooms with beds and shower facilities to allow passengers to refresh before a long-haul flight

There are also two restaurants inside the well-appointed lounge, in case the airport's other offerings don't spark your interest 

There are also works of art throughout the terminal, like the over-size Lamp Bear by Swiss artist Urs Fishcer (pictured)

But if you prefer not to bury your head in your iPad, plenty of art is also available to observe throughout the terminal.

The Qatari royal family is known for their collection of prime artworks, so it's not entirely surprising that the Hamad airport would display local, Arab and Western artists prominently.

Current works include the over-size Lamp Bear by Swiss artist Urs Fischer and a 'flock' of Arabian Oryx by Dutch artist Tom Claassen.

Pieces by Maurizio Cattelan, Damien Hirst and Jenny Holzer will also be displayed in the future.
