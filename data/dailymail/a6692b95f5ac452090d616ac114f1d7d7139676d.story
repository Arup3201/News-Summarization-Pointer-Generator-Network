Liverpool are ready to spend £100million in a transfer window for the first time in their history as Brendan Rodgers continues the revamp of his squad.

Rodgers has already paid out £57million to sign Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can but he has a further £75million in his kitty after selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona and intends to use that money to add another four, possibly five, new faces.

The Liverpool manager wants his squad to have class and depth and is adamant he will be able to attract top talent despite Alexis Sanchez rejecting a move to Anfield in favour of Arsenal – a decision Rodgers says was based purely on the Chilean’s desire to live in London.

Ready to spend: Rodgers has already purchased over £50m of talent this summer and is still in the market

Joining the club: Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic have joined the likes of Coutinho to support Sturridge

Sanchez 
would have been an outstanding acquisition but Rodgers has other ideas 
of how he can replace the 31 goals Suarez scored last season and Queens 
Park Rangers forward Loic Remy is a serious option to come in and work 
alongside Lambert and Daniel Sturridge.

A
 move for Swansea’s Wilfried Bony looks unlikely due to the player’s 
financial demands but Rodgers and his recruitment team will continue to 
explore options so that Liverpool have the right balance ahead of 
campaign in which they will return to the Champions League.

‘The
 signings we have made have absolutely no relation to Luis going – these
 were players that were always earmarked to come in,’ Rodgers explained.

‘We
 felt last year we never had the depth; we are in the Champions' League 
this year so we have to ensure we have a strong as squad as possible.

‘Obviously Luis going gives us the clout to go and spend more and we are getting the right type of player in.

Lining up: How Liverpool may look at the start of this coming season

Rodgers
 missed out on three big targets last summer – Henrik Myhkitaran, 
Willian and Diego Costa – but he does not believe Sanchez preference for
 joining Arsenal shows Liverpool, who are confident they will sign 
Southampton central defender Dejan Lovren, cannot compete for the best 
signatures.

He
 said. ‘That (Sanchez) was one where geography dictated where he wanted 
to go, simple as that. If anything, it’s been other way (and Liverpool 
are an attraction).

'Lots of players are really impressed by what we are doing as club and really excited about coming to Liverpool.

‘It
 was not lack of ambition from the club (that Sanchez went to Arsenal). 
The player and his family want to choose to live wherever that is. 
Sanchez is a fantastic player and would have suited us; his profile 
would have been great but it was not to be and we move on.’

Replaceable? Rodgers knows he has to replace the goals and creativity that Suarez provided last year

Suarez’s
 sale leaves Daniel Sturridge as Liverpool’s first choice forward – the 
England international will return to training next week on the 
pre-season tour of the United States – but Rodgers doesn’t want his team
 to be too reliant on one source of goals.

‘In the times Daniel has played up there without Luis, he has shown his qualities,’ Rodgers said.

‘But
 the onus is not really on one player. Our strength has been the team. 
When I came in, Luis was talked of as someone who didn’t score 
regularly, get enough opportunities or take them.

‘The
 last two years proved that with the number of chances we create that 
you can get goals. But it was not just about Luis. We scored 101 goals 
last season and he got 31 of them.

'We have goals all cross the team and will bring in players we think can assist with making them.’
