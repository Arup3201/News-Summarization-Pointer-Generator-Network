In a combined XV from these three sides, Sam Warburton would be the first name on my team sheet and he’d be my captain. 

Leigh Halfpenny’s kicking gets him in at full-back ahead of Mike Brown and Rob Kearney. I’ve chosen English wings because George North is still coming back to form as is Tommy Bowe. 

That’s a big statement but it shows just how highly I regard Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell. Alongside Jonathan Joseph at centre, I’m picking Robbie Henshaw.

I’m a massive fan of Jonathan Davies but he’s not quite at his best at the moment. 

Jonny Sexton and Conor Murray combine so well and Sexton is the No 1 fly-half in world rugby, so they pick themselves. In the forwards, I’ve put a fit Gethin Jenkins in ahead of Joe Marler. 

And Mike Ross gets the nod ahead of Dan Cole at No 3 because he was superb against England.
