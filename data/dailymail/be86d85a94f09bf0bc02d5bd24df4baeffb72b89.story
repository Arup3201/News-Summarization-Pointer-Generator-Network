More than one fifth of the UK's workers will be having their office Christmas party at some point this week.

But a new poll reveals that those getting drunk with colleagues would be wise to think ahead and pack a change of clothes... just in case.

Almost one in six of us (15 per cent) admit to not having made it home after their office party.

The YouGov research, commissioned for the Hotels.com 
mobile app shows that more than a million people (1,070,518) have turned up to
 work the next day wearing the same clothes as the day before – doing 
the work ‘walk of shame’ after the staff Christmas party.

Whilst easy to believe that younger team members will be the ones to 
party into the early hours, the study has revealed that Brits are in 
fact a nation of ‘Older-Indulgers’ with 45-54 year old Christmas party 
goers  almost twice as likely to have committed  the office walk of 
shame compared to the national average (5 per cent compared to 3 per cent). 

Results also reveal
 that as many as 750,000 Brits have slept in the office on the night of 
their Christmas party, with 45-54 year old men over twice as likely to 
have done so compared to the overall national average (5 per cent vs. 2 per cent).

But grabbing a night’s sleep in the office is very much a last resort. Roughly a
 third said they would be likely to book a suitably priced hotel room if
 they could find one quickly and easily.

Don't get caught out: More than one in 10 of those surveyed have opted to stay in a hotel room after a staff Christmas party (file photo)

More than one in 10 of those 
surveyed (11 per cent) have opted to stay in a hotel room after a staff Christmas
 party as it is cheaper than travelling home late at night, and six per cent know a
 colleague who has booked a hotel room intending  to spend the night 
with a co-worker.

With a number of hotel rooms in cities like London 
and Glasgow available for as little as £40, it comes 
as no surprise that many opt to get a good night’s rest than take a taxi
 home.

Apps like Hotels.com help you find a bed close to wherever you happen to be partying, and use of the app soars between seven and 10 p.m. when people start preparing for a heavy night.

Alison Couper from Hotels.com said: 'In the current economic 
climate it’s no surprise that so many of us intend to let our hair down 
at the work Christmas party, to sleep off the excitement of the night 
before and tackle the "morning after" in the office.'
