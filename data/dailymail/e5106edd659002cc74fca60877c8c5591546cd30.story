A woman accused of stabbing to death her boyfriend with a stiletto heel has been released on $100,000 bond, causing a witness in the case to fear a similar fate.

Ana Trujillo, 44, was freed from the Harris County Jail in Texas Wednesday. She is charged with stabbing her 59-year-old boyfriend, University of Houston professor Alf Stefan Anderson, as many as 30 times with the heel of her stiletto in June at his apartment.

Now, Jim Carroll, who is set to testify in her upcoming trial, is frightened for his life.

Self-defense: Trujillo was released Wednesday on $100,000. She claims she acted in self-defense

'She told me on two different 
occasions, that if anybody ever screwed with her that they were going to
get this in the eye and it was a stiletto heel,' Carroll told KHOU 11.

He
said he met Trujillo when she was renting an apartment at a complex he 
was managing. Ever since she was arrested, he's been watching his back, 
he explained.

She has 
been in custody for six months, and Carroll said he has spent that time 
constantly checking websites to see if she'd been released.

'It's
crazy, why would they let somebody out on bond that just murdered a guy
hitting him 31 times in the face with an object?' he said.Â

Carroll told KHOU 11 that he's not afraid to testify, but he is worried she may try to find him before she goes trial.

Trujillo's
attorney, Jack Carroll, no relation, said his client is scheduled to be
in court Friday morning to discuss conditions of her bond.

'I
expect self-defense may be a major issue in this case,' he said, adding
that there may be evidence that Trujillo was involved in an abusive 
relationship with Andersson.

Trujillo admitted in June that she killed Andersson in a lover's spat at their apartment.

Trujillo
and Andersson had spent most of the evening at Bodegas, a local taco 
shop, where they drank a couple bottles of wine and took a few tequila 
shots.

Walter Garcia, an assistant manager 
at the restaurant saw the couple there often. Andersson often came by 
himself, but would bring along his girlfriend on Fridays or special 
occasions.

'I knew him. He was a good person,' Garcia told the AP. 'They looked like a normal couple.'

But things turned sour that night 
when another man approached Trujillo at the bar and offered to buy her a
drink. Andersson got jealous of the stranger's advances which spurned a
fight back at his apartment around 2 a.m.

The ensuing fight was so loud, that neighbors thought it sounded like furniture moving.

When Andersson grabbed her, Trujillo 
told police that she pulled his hair - so much so that she had clumps of 
it in her hands. When that didn't stop him she started beating him with a
stiletto shoe causing multiple stab wounds.

Police arrived at 3:44 a.m., but who called the authorities is still unclear. When
police got to the 18th floor of the condo, Trujillo opened the door and
let officers into the unit, which is where they found Andersson in a 
hallway between the entryway and the kitchen.

While
Trujillo claims she acted in self-defense, that doesn't change the 
charges, according to Sara Marie Kinney, a spokesman for the Harris 
County District Attorney's office.

'She confessed to doing it. The reason and all of that will play out in court,' Kinney said.

Andersson's friends at Bodegas said they were sad to lose a regular and a friend.

'Everybody, now, we're very sad, angry with her, because he was customer No. 1,' Garcia said.

The bar hosted a memorial for Andersson after his death where they gave out free Bud Light and Jiro Tequila - his favorite drinks.
