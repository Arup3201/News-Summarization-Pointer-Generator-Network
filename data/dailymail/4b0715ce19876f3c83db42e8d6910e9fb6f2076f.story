Move on: Former Prime Minister John Major said every couple should have the opportunity to marry

Tory traditionalists should accept ‘we live in the 21st century’ and back gay marriage, Sir John Major said yesterday.

Amid increasing signs of a party split over legislation to be outlined this week, he will hail David Cameron’s ‘courageous and genuine’ campaign to give same-sex couples equal rights.

The former prime minister’s intervention came after senior Tories, including Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Scottish leader Ruth Davidson, who is a lesbian, launched a group in support of gay marriage.

Last month, the Daily Mail revealed that 118 of the party’s 303 MPs, had expressed some level of concern about the proposed gay marriage legislation in correspondence with constituents, though not all will vote against it. A further 12 MPs are also understood to have expressed doubts.

But Mr Johnson said the argument had gone on long enough and urged the Prime Minister to get on and ‘whack it through’.

‘The Labour Party will vote for it, the Liberals will vote for it, huge numbers of Tories will vote for it – whack it through, let’s knock this thing on the head,’ the London mayor told Sky News yesterday.

‘Nobody is calling for any change to any religious practice whatever and it is pretty clear from what the Prime Minister has said that no religion is going to be under any compulsion to do anything to change their observances.’

In a rare intervention in day-to-day politics, Sir John will today argue that society must ‘move on’ and permit gay couples to wed.

‘The Prime Minister’s instinct to support equal marriage is a courageous and genuine attempt to offer security and comfort to people who – at present – may be together, yet feel apart,’ he will say.

‘I fully understand that there are many who will find this difficult to accept, as will the churches. But the Prime Minister has made it clear that the churches will be free to make their own decisions upon whether to conduct such marriages and that is entirely the right approach. We live in the 21st century and must move on. Every couple should have the opportunity and the right to formalise their relationship.’

Support: Nick Herbert, right, who is in a civil partnership, and Boris Johnson, left, have both backed gay marriage

Former Home Office minister Nick Herbert, who is in a civil partnership, and is among 19 senior Tories backing the campaign for rapid reform, said all those who wanted to strengthen the institution of marriage should be in favour.

Rejecting the idea that legislating for gay unions was the wrong priority at a time when the coalition is focusing on the economy, Mr Herbert said: ‘Government can and should be able to do more than one thing at a time.

‘It needn’t take a lot of time but it is the right thing to do. Marriage is an important institution which should be cherished and promoted. It would be strengthened by the addition of same-sex couples.

‘Religious liberty is a fundamental principle and that should be protected, and no church should be forced to conduct same-sex marriage against its will.’

Other senior figures backing gay marriage include Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who is Catholic, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, an evangelical Christian, and former Tory ministers Lord Fowler and Nicholas Soames.

In a letter announcing the formation of the group, the 19 said: ‘Marriage should be open to all, regardless of sexuality.’

Tory Right-winger Peter Bone said the letter ‘implied most people who oppose the redefinition of marriage are homophobic’.

‘The Prime Minister is absolutely wrong on this,’ he added. ‘This cast iron guarantee he’s given that nobody will be forced, no church will be forced to marry is obviously false because the European courts will intervene.

‘What will happen when a couple go to a local church, same-sex, saying that they want to be married, that church turns them down, they’re off to the European Court and hey-ho, all churches will be forced to do it.

‘That’s what will happen and I don’t care what people say now, everyone knows that is what will happen down the line unless it is stopped. I just believe, as millions of people do in this country, that marriage is between a man and a woman.’

The legislation will include a clause designed to protect faith groups that do not want to perform same-sex marriages from legal challenges, while allowing those in favour to do so.
