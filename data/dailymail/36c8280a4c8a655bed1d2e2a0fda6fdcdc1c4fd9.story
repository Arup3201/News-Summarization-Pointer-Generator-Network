98,000 Barcelona supporters joined together at the Nou Camp on Sunday night to form a spectacular mosaic ahead of El Clasico, praising the club's 12th man - the fans themselves.

A Barcelona shirt with the number 12 on the back was made with red, yellow and blue pieces of card, with the words 'players, supporters' evident above.

The display was a fitting start to what was a fine evening for Barcelona against Real Madrid, with the Catalan giants eventually winning the game 2-1.

The mosaic could also have been a dig at Real Madrid, whose fans have turned on the team in recent times.

At the same time as the colourful scene in Barcelona, the club's anthem was sung acapella.

Gareth Bale looked to be up for the game as he walked out at the Nou Camp, replicating that high jump he often displayed as a Tottenham player.

However, the Welsh winger failed to influence proceedings as Jeremy Mathieu and Luis Suarez struck to give Barcelona a four-point lead at the top of La Liga.
