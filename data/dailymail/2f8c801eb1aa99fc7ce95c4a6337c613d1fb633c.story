The mother of an Iranian woman facing execution for killing a man she claims drugged and tried to rape her has said she wishes she could be killed in place of her daughter.

Reyhaneh Jabbari was sentenced to death by a criminal court in Tehran in 2009 after what Amnesty International called a 'deeply flawed investigation and trial which failed to examine all of the evidence'.

The punishment was due to be carried out on Tuesday, but Jabbari, 26, was granted a 10-day stay of execution - although only after she said what she had thought was going to be her final goodbye to her mother.

Now Shole Pakravan has given an emotional interview discussing her daughter's plight and begging the Iranian government to spare her life.

Speaking via Skype to Fox News, Pakravan said: 'I wish they would come tie a rope around my neck and kill me instead, but to allow Rayhaneh to come back home.'

'The only thing I want ... from God, from people around the world ... in any way, in any form, is I just want to bring Rayhaneh back home,' she added.

Jabbari was sentenced to death in 2009 for stabbing to death a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi.

The incident - which took place two years earlier in 2007, when Jabbari was just 19-years-old - occurred when Sarbandi met the former decorator in a cafe and convinced her to visit his office to discuss a business deal.

While there Sarbandi allegedly drugged and attempted to rape Jabbari, who grabbed a pocket knife and stabbed the civil servant - fleeing the scene as he bled to death.

Jabbari's execution was first postponed in April after a global petition to spare her life attracted 20,000 signatures. 

The punishment was rescheduled for this week, but on Monday it was deferred once again - apparently after Jabbari had said her final goodbyes to her family, while a government car waited outside Rajai Shahr Prison, near Tehran, to transport her to the execution site.

Jabbari's friends and relatives, including Pakravan, are a regular sight outside the prison, staging regular protests asking for the 26-year-old to be released.

The only thing I want in this universe is for Rayhaneh to be released. I have done everything I can think of,' Pakravan said. 

'I am a mother. No mother can accept the death of her child, she added.'

On Monday Amnesty International said the execution has only been delayed for 10 days - meaning Jabbari is likely to be killed next Friday.

At the time of the postponement, her mother spoke about the heart-breaking farewell phone call she received from her daughter.

'I am currently handcuffed and there is a car waiting outside to take me for the execution of the sentence... Goodbye, dear Mum. All of my pains will finish early tomorrow morning,' Jabbari said.

'I'll see you in the next world and I will never leave you again because being separated from you is the most difficult thing to do in the world,' she added.

There are numerous concerns over the way the case was handled by Iranian authorities.

Amnesty reports she was placed in solitary confinement for two months, where she did not have access to a lawyer or her family.

Last week Jabbari's mother said in a Facebook post that prison authorities told her she would have to go to the facility to 'collect the body' tomorrow. 

Raha Bahreini, rersearcher on Iran, told MailOnline that the threat of execution still looms, as under the Iranian law 'qesas' - or 'retribution-in-kind' - the family of the dead man can still demand she die.

'Instead of continuing to execute people, authorities in Iran should reform their judicial system, which dangerously relies on processes which fail to meet international law and standards for fair trial,' added Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director at Amnesty International.

'Under international human rights standards people charged with crimes punishable by death are entitled to the strictest observance of all fair trial guarantees.'

The Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which opposes the nation's leadership, said Jabbari was secretly transferred between prisons in a bid to prevent protests by other inmates who are sympathetic to her plight.

The organisation also claims that Jabbari underwent 'savage tortures' to extract a confession.

A statement said: 'The misogynic regime of the mullahs is attempting to intensify the atmosphere of terror in the society and to terrorise all women and youth who have not succumbed to the oppression and vulgarly of regime's elements.'

MEP Gérard Deprez, the chair of Friends of a Free Iran, a pressure group in the European Parliament, earlier called on Iran to halt the execution.

He said: 'Hassan Rouhani's government has hanged more than 1,000 people, many of them in public squares in Iranian cities. This is the worst record by any Iranian president for the past 25 years.

'If human rights are not improving in Iran, continued talks will only be seen as a green light for further aggression by the regime against its people as well as spreading its terror to other countries of the region.

'It is time the west imposes sanctions on Iran's human rights violations with no further delay.'
