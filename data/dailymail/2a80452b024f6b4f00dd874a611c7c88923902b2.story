Contestants on MasterChef can expect a change of tone after 'gentleman' judge Michel Roux Jr was replaced by Marcus Wareing.

Michelin-starred chef Wareing has been announced as the successor to Roux Jr on BBC2 series MasterChef: The Professionals.

He has a reputation as a difficult man to please, causing one Great British Menu contestant to swear and quit after he was given two out of ten for a fish dish, and leading another would-be chef to cry during a previous guest appearance on Masterchef.

Wareing cut his teeth cooking alongside Gordon Ramsay and the rambunctious pair almost came to blows on several occasions.

Wareing once said: 'I never did hit him. He was always a big, strong lad. If you did throw a punch at Gordon, you’d have to be sure to knock him out – otherwise he’d come back and swallow you.

'One time, about six months before he and I finished, he came into the kitchen on a Saturday night. We had a conversation. Things got so heavy that we had to go outside.'

Roux Jr stepped down earlier this year as a result of a dispute with the BBC about his endorsement of a brand of potatoes.

It is thought Wareing will have a different attitude towards hopefuls than outgoing judge Michel Roux Jr

Dale Williams - who was brought to tears when Wareing said he needed a fire extinguisher after eating his food on the amateur version of the show - said the two men had very different styles.

He told the Telegraph: 'Everybody who ever met Michel Roux Jnr talked about him being the nicest gentleman they ever met. [The BBC] are probably looking to shake it up a bit.'

Wareing - who has two Michelin stars and is currently Chef Patron of a restaurant in Knightsbridge, west London - joins Monica Galetti and Gregg Wallace on the judging panel for the seventh series which returns in the autumn.

He said: 'I have been watching MasterChef since I was a young kid at catering college and in more recent years I have enjoyed an established relationship with the programme.

'To now become part of the show is hugely exciting for me; to be asked is a true honour. Michel has left big shoes to fill and I am delighted to be working with Monica and Gregg on a new journey of discovery to find the next generation of Michelin-starred chefs.'

Wareing began his career at 18 working at The Savoy and went on to be awarded his first star seven years later.

Karen Ross, the creative director of the production company behind the show Shine Soho, said: 'We are delighted that he is taking up the baton of judge with us - his experience of coming from humble beginnings in the North of England and making his way into the country's best kitchens, to then rise to be awarded two Michelin stars is extremely inspiring and will speak to the young chefs who hope to follow in his footsteps.'

A MasterChef spokesperson added: 'Avid viewers of MasterChef will have seen Marcus appear previously and he is fair, honest and insightful.

'MasterChef: The Professionals is about empowering and encouraging the next generation of Michelin-starred chefs – precisely what Marcus does on a daily basis in his restaurants and we're delighted that he will be translating his considerable experience and sharing his advice with our contestants.'
