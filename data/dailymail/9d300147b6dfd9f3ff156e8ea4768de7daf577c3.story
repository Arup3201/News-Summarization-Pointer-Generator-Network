Basketball legend Charles Barkley has told how he once gained 20lbs in 48 hours to avoid being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1984 NBA draft.

The 51-year-old revealed on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that he didn't want to play for the team because they were only paying $75,000 for a one-year deal and he didn't leave college early to be 'poor'.

In a bid to make himself undesirable before the drafting, he ate two Grand Slam breakfasts from Denny's totaling 1,660 calories, went to lunch at Red Lobster gobbling down every hush puppy in sight, and  feasted on two T-bone steaks for dinner.

Weight gain: Basketball legend Charles Barkley, 51, has told how he once put on 20lbs in 48 hours to avoid being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1984 NBA draft

He then repeated the menu the following day before flying to Philadelphia for his final weigh-in.

After his non-stop feeding session Barkley managed to bulk up his 6ft 6in frame to 302lbs.

The mass of salty, fried food is likely to have caused water retention and subsequent weight gain.

However, the sport star's trick failed to turn off NBA managers and he landed a spot with the Philadelphia 76ers.

Recalling the moment he found out he had been picked by the team, he told Fallon: 'I said, "oh hell no, now I'm fat and poor."'

Mouthful: In a bid to make himself undesirable before the drafting, Barkley ate four Grand Slam breakfasts from Denny's - totaling 3,320 calories - in 48 hours - he also gorged on large lunches and dinners

Barkley went on to play for the team for eight years and was ranked one of the top players on court.

He later moved to the Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets before retiring in 2000 to take up TV sports commentary. 

On hanging up his basketball vest, Barkley gained a noticeable 100lbs.

'I come from Alabama, a state that has struggled with obesity for years. I mean it is the heart of the South - we love food.' Barkley said at the time.

After managing to beat the bulge the married father-of-one became a representative for Weight Watchers.
