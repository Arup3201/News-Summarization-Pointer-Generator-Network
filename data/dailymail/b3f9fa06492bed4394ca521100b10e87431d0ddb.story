George Osborne today ordered the massive expansion of controversial shale gas exploration in Britain – known as fracking – despite fears it could cause earthquakes and contaminate water.

To the fury of environmentalists, the Chancellor wants to encourage more companies to use the technique, which involves creating explosions deep underground to release valuable gas.

Mr Osborne unveiled his 'generous new tax regime' in the Autumn Statement this afternoon to encourage fracking exploration and unlock shale gas reserves that could be worth £1.5trillion to Britain's economy.

The UK's only fracking operation in Blackpool caused two tremors from its drilling last year and is waiting to hear if it can start again.

Controversial: Drilling in the Blackpool area last year caused a small earthquake but the Government wants to expand the use of fracking in Britain

Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the process of injecting liquid 
deep underground to fracture shale rock and release gas contained in it.

The Government is consulting on tax breaks for the unconventional fossil fuel extraction, which has been widely exploited in the US, leading to falling gas prices.

But there are also fears that widespread use of shale gas wells will harm the look of the UK countryside, damage tourism and reduce house prices.

Opposition to fracking is intensifying in Britain as the jury is still out on whether the controversial gas extraction process will poison drinking water and cause major environmental damage.

In Blackpool last year, fracking was found to be the 'highly probable' cause of earth tremors.

One tremor of magnitude 2.3 on the Richter scale hit the area on April 1 followed by a second of magnitude 1.4 on May 27, prompting locals and environmental campaigners to blame the fracking technique being used locally by oil and gas firm Cuadrilla.

Energy companies have said the process is safe but environment groups warn it could pose human health risks.

Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla, has said the process does not pose a threat to UK groundwater.

But horror stories have emerged from the US, where fracking is common, including reports of tap water igniting when a match is lit and claims of contaminated water making people ill.

Such concerns have led to bans or moratoria on fracking in some places.

France has banned fracking from shale rock and New York state has introduced a moratorium.

Environmental groups in the UK have been calling for a moratorium at least until environmental and safety impacts have been addressed.

In Australia, ground water and soil contamination fears have led farmers and green groups to form an unlikely alliance against fracking.

Concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to Bath’s world-famous hot springs.

Bath and North East Somerset Council said in September that two resource companies have applied for planning permission to test- drill for gas but the council fears that, if allowed to go ahead, it could harm the springs.

Despite this the Chancellor today told MPs: 'We must ensure we make the best use of lower cost gas power, including new sources of gas under the land.

'We don’t want British families and businesses to be left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the Atlantic.

'We are consulting on new tax incentives for shale gas and announcing the creation of a single office so that regulation is safe but simple.'

The Chancellor is desperate to boost domestic gas exploration as a way of reducing Britain’s dependence on foreign gas supplies.

The sharp decline in North Sea gas finds makes Britain more reliant on energy supplies from Qatar, Russia and the US.

But
 environmentalists attacked the move for undermining investment and jobs
 which could be created in clean technology, as well as pushing up 
energy costs for consumers as the UK would remain tied to increasingly 
expensive fossil fuels.

The
 Office for Unconventional Gas and Oil will join up responsibilities 
across government departments to provide a single point of contact for 
investors and streamline the regulatory process.

Even if ten per cent of the gas in unpopulated areas is extracted, it would still be worth £150billion.

Nick Molho, head of energy policy at 
WWF-UK, said: 'The UK’s over-reliance on gas is, environmentally and 
economically, highly risky.

Greenpeace
 political director Joss Garman said: 'The Chancellor is misleading 
people to position shale gas as the answer to UK’s energy woes.'

The
 consultation on tax breaks for shale gas in the UK was welcomed by 
Cuadrilla, the company seeking to exploit shale resources near Blackpool
 whose work was suspended last year after fracking triggered two tremors
 in the area.

The 
Department of Energy and Climate Change is due to make an announcement 
next week on whether Cuadrilla’s operations can restart. The company 
wants to drill, fracture and test a small of wells in 2013.

Francis
 Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, said: 'Exploration is necessary to 
have a better understanding about how shale gas can be developed safely 
and sensibly from the Bowland Basin.

'Costs in a technology industry such as ours will be higher at the outset, but will reduce over time as the industry grows.'

Anger: A demonstrator wears a George Osborne mask as part of protests against fracking but the Chancellor is offering huge incentives for companies to use the technique in Britain

But environmentalists have pledged to fight it.

Marion Seed from Central Lancashire Friends of the Earth, said: 'Local 
people are extremely alarmed by George Osborne’s fracking plans - they 
could pollute our clean water and air, threaten house prices and destroy
 our vital farming and tourism sectors.

'We will fight any plans that could turn a beautiful part of the Lancashire countryside into a wasteland.'
