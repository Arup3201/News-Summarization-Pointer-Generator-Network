Gus Poyet said he expects to remain at Sunderland next season as the club’s fans made their feelings known by chanting his name despite a home defeat by Swansea.

Most of the 45,000 spectators at the Stadium of Light stayed behind after the final whistle to serenade Poyet as he led his players on their lap of appreciation following a miraculous escape from relegation.

Sunderland were seven points adrift of safety just four weeks ago but then took 13 points of 15 including wins at Chelsea and Manchester United to put Poyet on the radar of West Ham and Spurs, both of whom could have managerial vacancies this summer.

Poyet does want assurances from Sunderland chairman Ellis Short about rebuilding the team over the summer to avoid another relegation fight next term. Short was present on Sunday and is privately confident that Poyet will continue in charge.

The pair met on Sunday lunchtime and will resume talks in a week after the Uruguayan has had a short holiday.

But
 asked if he expected to be Sunderland manager next season, Poyet said: 
‘Yes. I asked a lot of the fans this year and now my challenge is to 
give a lot next year. But for this we need to be a better team.

‘I want to know where we are going because I don’t want to go through another year like this one. I like to plan.

‘Are
 we a team whose aim is to stay up or are we going to go for the top 10?
 I always think the amount of people in the stadium show where you can 
be.

'We get 40,000 at Sunderland so I think we should be higher.’

Sunday’s
 game showed how much work needs to be done at the Stadium of Light 
particularly with eight players out of contract and another three due to
 return to their clubs after loan spells.

Swansea’s finishing was clinical but Sunderland’s defending atrocious.

Phil
 Bardsley, one of those who could leave, was caught napping as Nathan 
Dyer ran inside to convert Wayne Routledge’s throughball with a 
first-time chip after seven minutes.

The
 visitors' lead then doubled after 14 minutes when Marvin Emnes turned 
33-year-old John O’Shea too easily before shooting home.

Although
 on-loan Liverpool striker Fabio Borini briefly raised Sunderland hopes 
with a 50th minute header from Adam Johnson’s corner, Wilfried Bony 
restored Swansea’s two-goal advantage four minutes later when he 
capitalised on lax marking to shoot home his 16th Premier League goal of
 the season.

Swansea took a 
risk appointing 35-year-old former player Garry Monk as manager after 
sacking Michael Laudrup mid-season, changing his status from interim to 
permanent last week.

He 
acknowledged that after guiding his team to 12th place: ‘Next season I will 
be judged more harshly, every single move I make. But I know that and I 
accept it,’ he said. ‘I am looking forward to being judged. I’ve had a 
point to prove my whole career.’

Monk plans to add to his squad this summer and make Emnes’ loan move from Middlesbrough permanent.

Most importantly, he expects the club to turn down Arsenal or any other club waving £15million in their direction for Bony.

‘We
 are lucky we don’t have to sell anyone - it is up to us. Bony is one 
we will keep here. There is an even better player waiting to come out.’
