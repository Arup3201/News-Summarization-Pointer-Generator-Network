'I'm really quite dedicated to the sport... But I try not to take to much away from the children – that’s the reason I get up so early,' she told told Daily Mail Australia.  

'I get up really early at 3am and have a coffee before heading to the gym for my fasted cardio, which means I have no food in my tummy. I get on the stepper for 40 minutes.

'I make myself a protein drink and then I hit the weights. I get home by 6.30am and it's time for me to make the lunch boxes and get my kids off to school.'

Ms Doherty then spends time preparing her meals for the day before heading back to the gym she runs with her husband Tony in Brunswick to train her clients. 

'I really like to eat fresh food so I prepare six to seven meals for the day,' she said.

Amanda gets to the gym at 3.30am and is back home by 6.30am to make the lunch boxes and get her four children, aged five to 13, off to school

'I generally eat oats for breakfast with protein powder and then I'll eat five ounces of protein with one third of a cup of brown rice every two hours.

'You have to work hard and it takes a little bit of sacrifice.'

Ms Doherty says she sacrifices a lot of sleep and, to an extent, a social life.

'I've never been one to go out and drink alcohol but there's small sacrifices along the way. I can't stand around at school and talk to other mums because I've got to get back to the gym.

'I prefer to spend any other time with my kids.'

Ms Doherty said her lifestyle has a flow on effect with her children, now aged five to 13.

'They watch what I do and I think mostly they’re proud of me. Sometimes they get angry when the smell of salmon or meat fills the kitchen,' she said.

Amanda, who started bodybuilding when she was 19, took a break when she was 27 to start her family 

As soon as she had her fourth child at 35, Ms Doherty was straight back into it and hasn't looked back

'This has definitely educated them about nutrition. We have a draw at home full of treats but it never gets empty.

'The children want to eat healthily. If my kids want a pie for dinner, they can have one. I'm not worried because they're active children.'  

Ms Doherty, who started bodybuilding when she was 19, took a break when she was 27 to start her family.

'I put on 15-20 kilos when I had my first child. I was eating more and gave into cravings. People told me I would be eating for two. That was a real learning curve - you're not eating for two, you have to have enough nutrition for two,' she said.
