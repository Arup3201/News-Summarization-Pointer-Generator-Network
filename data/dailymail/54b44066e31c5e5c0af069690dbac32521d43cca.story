The heartbreaking moment a puppy runs after a car in desperation after it was dumped at the gate of an animal centre has been caught on CCTV.

The footage shows a silver Renault car drawing up to the gates of the RSPCA Birmingham Animal Centre,  before the driver opens a door and forces the Staffordshire bull terrier puppy out.

The car is then seen speeding off, with the six-month-old puppy chasing after it in desperation. The confused dog can then be seen running back to the animal centre's gates.

She was fortunately picked up by two members of the public who found her outside the gates a short while later.

It is not known if the driver of the car was the dog's owner.

The puppy, who has been named Tinsel by RSPCA staff, is currently being cared for at the centre and is looking to be rehomed.

Elaine Buchan, RSPCA centre manager, said: 'It was really hard for staff to watch the CCTV and see this incident unfold and then watch as this driver just sped off leaving this puppy alone.

'As she starts to follow the car your 
heart just breaks for her, sheâ€™s been dumped alone and left confused - 
just because someone doesnâ€™t want her any more. 

'It is even more upsetting that this has been done just before Christmas.

'People who take on animals have a legal responsibility to care for them and people who take on a pet should take into account whether they have the time and money to care for the animal 365 days of the year for potentially the next 10 to 20 years.

'Dumping them is not acceptable - pets are a lifelong commitment and people need to think carefully before getting a pet as animals have the right to be loved for life.'
