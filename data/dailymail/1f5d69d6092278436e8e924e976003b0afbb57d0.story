Pioneer: Victoria Newlove has become the first Brit to have a single-port hysterectomy

It is fortunate that Victoria Newlove has an excellent relationship with her surgeon.

For just eight weeks before her scheduled hysterectomy, he revealed that she would be the first person in the UK to undergo a new technique: he was going to remove her womb through her belly button.

This incredible procedure sees the hysterectomy performed through a single incision in the belly button. It is virtually scar-less and patients recover within a fortnight.

It’s all a far cry from the traditional operation that leaves a long scar across the abdomen and involves days spent in hospital and weeks of pain and recovery.

It is being pioneered in the UK by consultant gynaecologist Professor John Erian, one of the godfathers of laparoscopic, or keyhole, surgery.

‘The procedure is a huge advancement as it frees women from discomfort quickly and safely, with little risk of infection,’ he says. ‘It’s suitable for everyone and I hope it will one day become the most common form of hysterectomy.’

A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, or womb. About 65,000 are performed each year in the UK, and one in five women will undergo the surgery at some point in their lives, usually by the age of 60.

It is undertaken most commonly due to painful fibroids, endometriosis, severe bleeding, vaginal prolapse or uterine and cervical cancer.

Women may also choose the surgery if they have the BRAC1 or BRAC2 gene, which significantly raises their chance of ovarian cancer.

Victoria needed the operation because of severe endometriosis, where small pieces of endometrial (womb) tissue attach to surrounding organs. It can cause extreme pain and heavy bleeding and affects about two million women.

‘My periods were always heavy and painful,’ says Victoria, 31, who lives in Kent with her husband, Steve, 38, a signalling engineer, and their children Isabella, four, and Sophia, one.

‘But as time went on they got worse and worse.’ On one occasion she passed out from the pain and blood loss, so her doctor referred her to Professor Erian.

‘I always knew I would need a hysterectomy at some point as my condition kept deteriorating,’ she says.

‘Since I was first referred 11 years ago, I’ve had tissue lasered away six times but it isn’t a long-term solution. I’d imagined intrusive abdominal surgery, so was thrilled to hear about the new operation.’

Of the 57,000 hysterectomies performed annually in NHS hospitals, more than 35,000 are abdominal hysterectomies – where an incision of about 5in is made across the abdomen. The hospital stay is around five nights, and a further six to eight weeks are needed for recovery.

Two other main options exist: 
laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, where the womb is removed 
through the vagina (not suitable for women who have had a caesarean), 
and total laparoscopic hysterectomy – keyhole surgery, where three to 
four incisions are made in the abdomen.

This method accounts for less 
than six per cent of UK hysterectomies. Very occasionally this is done 
through an incision in the belly button, with the womb removed through 
the vagina.

The new operation takes laparoscopic surgery one step further and has been made possible due to new instruments. Prof Erian, who operates at BMI Chelsfield Park Hospital in Kent, says: ‘I heard about the new procedure a year ago and have been waiting for the instruments to be refined. To my knowledge, this operation has been performed in only one other country – Greece – by an ex-pupil of mine. I am thrilled to introduce it here.’

Victoria had her surgery two weeks ago, under general anaesthetic as a private patient at Chelsfield Park.

First an incision was made – about half an inch long – into which a ‘port’ was inserted. This is like a small plate with three tiny holes through which different instruments are inserted into the abdomen.

The first hole holds a tiny camera, another contains an instrument like minute tweezers that can grasp the womb, and the third takes an instrument that can seal blood vessels and cut tissue using high-frequency thermal energy.

All the instruments can be used remotely.

Prof Erian explains: ‘The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to allow better visualisation. Then one fallopian tube is grasped and the blood vessels are sealed, followed by the second.

‘A loop-shaped instrument – like a lasso – is inserted and tightened about the uterus to secure it, then thermal energy cuts it away.’ The uterus is cut up in situ and sucked out through the port.

The whole procedure took just 45 minutes. Prof Erian left an ovary and fallopian tube, so Victoria won’t go through early menopause.

‘I was able to walk after less than 24 hours,’ she says. ‘When I went home – after just two nights – I only took paracetamol and ibuprofen as there wasn’t much pain.

‘After ten days I was able to pick my daughter up and drive around. Now I feel a little discomfort but nothing compared to the agony of my periods.

‘I am so relieved I’ll never suffer that again, and that my scar will be near-invisible so I’ll still be able to wear a bikini!’
