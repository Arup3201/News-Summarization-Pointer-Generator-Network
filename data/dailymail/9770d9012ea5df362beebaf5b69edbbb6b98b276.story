Firefighters responding to the fiery crash that claimed Paul Walker's life stated he was 'dead on arrival', newly-released emergency dispatch tapes have revealed.

The recordings emerged as his devastated mother, Cheryl, was pictured outside her Los Angeles home on Thursday - the first time she has been seen since her son and his friend died on Saturday.

In the tapes, which first appeared on TMZ, a firefighter speaks with 911 dispatcher and declares the actor dead almost immediately after he and other emergency responders arrive on the scene

'One vehicle fully involved,' says the firefighter, who arrived less than three minutes after the first 911 call about the crash. 'We have confirmed two DOA... again, confirmed two fatalities.'

Sorrow: Paul Walker's mother Cheryl collects the mail outside her home in Los Angeles California on Thursday - a day before dispatch recordings emerged showing that firefighters declared her son 'DOA'

The firefighter adds that it is a 'Code N' incident, which means an event is newsworthy and needs to be handled delicately.

Walker's friends on the scene had most likely informed firefighters that he was inside, TMZ reported.

According to an autopsy released on Wednesday, Walker was killed by injuries from both the impact and the subsequent fire.

The
 actor died from the ‘combined effects of traumatic and thermal 
injuries,’ according to the autopsy released by the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office.

Tragedy: Paul Walker, pictured in May this year, was killed when the car exploded into flames Saturday

The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was
 driven by Rodas, who was dead from ‘multiple traumatic injuries’ 
before the car exploded in flames, the autopsy said.

Results of toxicology testing will take another six to eight weeks.

The details emerged as Walker's mother Cheryl,
 a former fashion model, was spotted collecting mail and putting the 
trash out in the front yard of her Los Angeles home on Thursday.

Cheryl
 was instrumental in developing Paul's acting career at a young age, 
taking him to magazine and TV commercial auditions and hired as a child 
model, which helped to financially support his large family.

Her appearance came a day after the late actor's grieving sister Amie joined a female friend at Starbucks looking grim faced, while his younger brother Cody began the heart-breaking task of clearing up the late actor’s 
personal belongings from his Santa Barbara home.

Cody Walker, 25, visited his late brother's home in Santa
 Barbara, California, on Wednesday afternoon and later could be seen 
packing boxes of the Fast & Furious star’s possessions into the back of a car.

As Cody packed the trunk with items including clothes, a surf board, a rifle and 
several boxes, a concerned neighbour stopped to give him a hug and pass 
on her condolences.

The
 gates to the actor's home has become something of a shrine in recent 
days as fans wishing to pay their respects have left countless bouquets 
of flowers and candles.

Walker starred in all but one of the six Fast & Furious blockbuster films that glorified fast cars and dangerous driving.

Sheriff's
 investigators are still trying to determine what caused Rodas to career
 out of control on Saturday. They have said speed was a factor in the crash
 about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

The
 limited-edition Porsche was previously owned by IndyCar driver Graham 
Rahal, who has said it was difficult to drive. It is not just fast - it 
can hit 100 mph in less than 7 seconds - but also unforgiving in its 
handling.

Little more than a month before the 
actor's tragic death on Saturday, the Walker family had celebrated a family 
wedding as another brother, Caleb, 36, had married his fiancée Stephanie
 Branch.

Supportive: Paul Walker's brother, Cody Walker, paid a visit to mother Cheryl on Thursday

Together: Cody, with a relative on Thursday, began clearing his brother's belongings this week

Upset: Cody was among a string of family and friends offering help to Cheryl throughout the day

Paul was best man on the big day and Cody a groomsman in the now poignant photos that show
 the brothers laughing and smiling together for what would be one of the last ever times.

The stunning album of pictures give a glimpse of the close-knit family who are now grieving following the actor's death.

With a smile on his face and a cheeky 
glint in his eye, the Fast & Furious star can be seen toasting his brother Caleb on his special day.

Paul is also seen posing with his 
fellow groomsmen at the wedding held on October 23 at Dove Canyon 
Country Club in Orange County, California.

The Walker clan are said to be 
extremely close and earlier this week, Paul's sister Ashlie Walker told 
MailOnline the family are trying to cope by using their Mormon faith.

Furious
 Ashlie, 37, also hit out at reports her brother and his good friend
 Roger Rodas - who was at the wheel of a Porsche when they crashed in 
Los Angeles on Saturday - were drag racing at the time of their death.

Breaking
 her silence, Miss Walker said: 'They were absolutely not racing, that's
 a complete lie. It hurts us when we hear these lies and it makes our 
grief worse and more painful.

Loss: Paul Walker's younger brother Cody takes a moment to contemplate as he spent several hours on Wednesday removing items from the Fast & Furious star's Santa Barbara home

'These
 are irresponsible allegations and people are trying to make out speed 
and racing was the reason for his death when it was just a terrible 
accident.' 

A close family member said Paul would
 be the 'biggest angel in heaven', adding: ‘Paul was a wonderful man and
 the best person you could ever meet. We are all totally distraught and 
beside ourselves with grief.

‘We
 can gain hope from this tragic accident through our strong Christian 
background and faith. We are grateful to be surrounded by such loving 
friends and family that have been praying for us and will be forever by 
our sides.

'We seek comfort 
in their love and our faith. We definitely believe that Paul has gone to
 a better place and is now with our heavenly father.

'We have a strong Mormon faith and although Paul wasn’t practicing at the time, he always had a very strong Christian faith.'

'We welcome Paul's brothers into our FAST family': Cody (left) and Caleb (centre) - pictured here with their late brother at Caleb's October wedding - will 'help complete some remaining action and fill in small gaps left in production'

Meanwhile, Universal Pictures announced 
that it has shut down production for an unspecified time on the seventh 
installment of the Fast & Furious franchise.

The studio announced Wednesday that 
the film will shut down 'for a period of time so we can assess all 
options available to move forward with the franchise.'

The seventh installment of the street
 car racing series had begun shooting in September. While much of Fast 
& Furious 7 has been filmed, it's far from complete.

When Walker died in a fiery car crash Saturday north of Los Angeles, the film was on break for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Shooting had been planned to resume Monday in Atlanta, but production was put on hold following Walker's death.

Universal had been trying to 
fast-track Fast & Furious 7 for a July 11 release, a date that's 
likely to be postponed. Universal hasn't yet announced any release date 
change.

'Right now, all of us at Universal 
are dedicated to providing support to Paul's immediate family and our 
extended Fast & Furious family of cast, crew and filmmakers,' the 
studio said in a statement.

Walker starred in all but one 
installment of the Fast & Furious franchise, which has been 
particularly lucrative for Universal. Fast & Furious 6, released in 
May, was the highest grossing film in the series, earning more than $788
 million worldwide.

Universal announced on Tuesday that 
it will donate a portion of the proceeds from the upcoming DVD, Blu-ray 
and digital release of Fast & Furious 6 to Walker's charity Reach 
Out Worldwide.

Walker, 40, founded Reach Out 
Worldwide in 2010 to give first-response aid to victims of natural 
disasters. Walker was hosting a fundraiser for the nonprofit on Saturday
 afternoon before the crash.
