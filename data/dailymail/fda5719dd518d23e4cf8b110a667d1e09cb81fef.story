A Chinese restaurant in the heart of Sydney's Chinatown has received a barrage of racist abuse after an article was published claiming they charged higher prices for non-Chinese customers.

A story in Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper claimed the Yin Li SIchuan Chinese Restaurant charged English-speaking customers 'more than 10 per cent extra per dish' than on the Chinese language menu.

Since the story appeared, the restaurant has been the subject of at least ten racist telephone threats, Ms Zhang said, as well as a torrent of abuse directed to the restaurant online.

Diana Xu says she was falsely accused of charging English speaking customers more than Chinese customers at her Sydney restaurant, Yin Li Sichuan

The restaurant has received at least 10 threatening phone calls as well as abusive comments on a review page for their business on Facebook

Ren Zhou Lawyers representing the Yin Li Sichuan told the Daily Mail Australia the owners were considering legal action.

Lawyer Ying Zhang said the owner flatly denied ever telling the reporter there was a 'secret price' for Chinese customers.

This is despite the article stating: 'Yin Li Sichuan restaurant owner Diana suggested [the price difference] was meant to be a secret among Asian customers.'

Ms Zhang said the Yin Li Sichuan Restaurant would wait and see if there is further racist abuse from members of the public and if their business began to suffer before proceeding with legal action.

'The difference between the prices is only for three items on the menu, and it is because of a printing error. The Chinese menu had not been updated,' she said.

Mapo Tofu (above) was one of three items in which the price on the Chinese menu had not been updated. Ms Xu said the restaurant has since updated their Chinese menu to be exactly the same as the English menu (right)

The Daily Telegraph reported that the restaurant's two menus - one written in English and one in Chinese - had different prices despite listing the same dishes.

But Ms Xu told the Mail Online that this was only the case for three dishes the fried rice with lettuce and beef, the Mapo tofu and the dried spicy beans. Those three dishes were 'different by $1 or $2'.

She said that some of the older Chinese menus still had to be updated with recent price increases.

'This year we have an increase in rent and staff [numbers] have increased,' Ms Xu said.

'The English menu is a new menu. This Chinese menu we actually need to fix.'

Ms Xu said that she was shocked to read the article and very upset at being accused of discrimination.

'I think many things are not true because we don't have different [prices] for Chinese people and Australian people,' she said.

Ms Xu  said she was distraught at the claims her restaurant was 'racist', saying she had been open for 13 years and had a number of regulars both Chinese and non-Chinese backgrounds

'We have been open for 13 years, we can promise everything is the same. All customers, if they come in my restaurant, are welcome.'

She said that she only offered discounts to a small number of regulars, both Chinese and non-Chinese, who she said visit the restaurant for a meal at least two or three times a week, adding that they received the same discount regardless of their background, race or the language they speak.

The only difference in the menus is the variation of spiciness, particularly in sauces, which she said they decided to change after local customers complained.
