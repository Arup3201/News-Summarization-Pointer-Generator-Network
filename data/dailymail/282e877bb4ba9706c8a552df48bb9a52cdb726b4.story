Three women who were allegedly recorded without their knowledge during sex with a disgraced Morgan Stanley banker are speaking out against the former executive's defense team.

The alleged victims told the New York Post that John C. Kelly's high-priced lawyers are attempting to drag them through the mud in an effort to get him off the hook.

Kelly is accused of planting cameras in his apartment on East 69th Street in New York City and recording his sexual encounters without the knowledge of his partners from May 2011 until December 2012.

Now, Kelly's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, is claiming one of the alleged victims is actually a jealous stalker who only called the cops because she was spurned by the former banker.

Fall from grace: John C. Kelly, the son of a prominent attorney, is fighting the charges that he illegally recorded his partners during sex

The woman, an Ivy League graduate, says Mr Brafman's claim is outrageous.

'It’s beyond humiliating. It hurts, it’s a betrayal and it’s so shameful,' one of the women told the Post.

The Post reports that Kelly also allegedly recorded the women at their own apartments, setting up his open laptop facing the bed and claiming he needed the computer toe respond to work emails.

A lawyer for one of the victims says he uploaded at least some of the videos to video sharing sites YouTube and Vimeo.

One of the clips, a tryst with an Indian woman, was called 'India Research,' the Post reports.

'The videos are very shocking and disturbing,' a 34-year-old alleged victim told the newspaper. She said she met Kelly eight years ago and thought they had been in an exclusive relationship.

'It’s so creepy, because you can see him [on the video] setting them up, clicking away while we’re out of the room. And they’re angled in such a way that he’s showing off every intimate part of our bodies.'

Canine scapegoat: Kelly told investigators he 
had set up cameras to monitor his pooch (right) while he was at work, but
 the devices ended up recording his sexcapade, according to police

Another alleged victim said: 'People 
were crying when they saw them because they’re so violating — he would 
look at the camera and it was clear that we didn’t know what he was 
doing.'

Authorities say Kelly, the son 
of noted defense lawyer John Q. Kelly, had previously blamed his dog for
 the videos - claiming he had set up cameras in his Manhattan apartment 
to keep an eye on his pooch, but the device accidentally caught his 
sexual escapades.

'It’s on 
and sometimes stays on. So I accidentally recorded myself having sex 
because it’s always recording,' police say Kelly told them February 26, 2013. 

According
 to attorney Daniel Parker, who represents one of the women at the 
center of the case, the X-rated recordings were not made by accident 
since Kelly used a sophisticated surveillance system featuring a hidden 
camera, a webcam and a phone application to record his victims in his 
apartment and in their own homes, New York Post reported.

In the doghouse: While Kelly has insisted that the surveillance was accidental, an attorney representing one of the victims claimed that the financier had a complex video recording system in place suggesting that he intended to tape his sex romps

Prosecutors claim Kelly shot videos of 
his amorous activities with three different partners between September 
2011 and December 2012. Revelations of the conduct drove one woman to 
trash his apartment.

The women were in his apartment at separate times, the New York Daily News reported. 

‘In this case, the defendant videotaped three unrelated women while they were performing sexual acts on him in his home,’ said prosecutor Siobhan Carthy during the financier’s arraignment in November, the paper reported.

Victims ‘did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images,’ the criminal complaint stated.

The breasts, buttocks and vagina of one of the victims could be clearly seen in the video, officials said.

One of the women who found out about the secret recordings broke into Mr Kelly’s apartment, according to the Daily News. She trashed the place, poured soda onto his computer and was charged with burglary. She only went to police after he had her arrested and she spent a night in jail, his lawyers claim.

The charges have since been dismissed.

Kelly was arrested in connection to the sex tapes November 8, 2013 - on the same day that he was fired from his job for allegedly writing bad checks, according to the Post.

His father, John Q. Kelly, once represented former New York Yankee player Joe Pepitone and the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson - the slain wife of O.J. Simpson.
