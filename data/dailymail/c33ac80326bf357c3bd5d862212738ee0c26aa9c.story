A woman suspected of stealing from a Macy’s in the San Gabriel Valley fled topless after her top and bra came off as she struggled with a police officer attempting to detain her.

The woman is alleged to have stolen items from the store, at the Westfield Santa Anita mall, on the evening of June 29 and put them in her purse.

However, she was confronted by a Macy’s loss prevention officer before she could leave.

A struggle then ensued in which she hit the officer several times and lost her clothing.

A police officer told CBS Los Angeles: ‘During the altercation, the suspect’s shirt and bra came off.’

The woman, 44, is described as being of Asian origin, but hasn’t been named yet.

The officer added: ‘[The woman] ran to her car topless and left behind her purse containing her driver’s license.’

Wanted: Police said the woman was 44 years old and left her licence behind, but she hasn't been named yet

A witness saw her driving away in a white Mercedes and took note of the licence plate number.

Earlier this month footage has emerged of Arkansas officers pursuing and arresting a naked female who was running through a parking lot.

On the evening of July 1 police in Fayetteville received a call from a member of public who said that a naked woman ‘intoxicated on drugs and “tripping balls”’ was running around the town center.

Two squad cars were dispatched, with the woman in question, later named as 21-year-old Melissa Valencia, filmed on an in-car camera.

At the start of the footage she is seen running away from the police units and an officer giving chase on foot.

The clip then shows her struggling with officers as they try to arrest her.

She was charged with misdemeanor public intoxication, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges.
