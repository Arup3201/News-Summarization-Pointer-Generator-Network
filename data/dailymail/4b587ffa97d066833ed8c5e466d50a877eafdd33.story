She gleefully tortured suspects, falsely claimed the tactics worked, and lost key information that could have prevented the 9/11 attacks.

And then she got a raise.

This is the CIA's queen of torture.

The unnamed detective - who remains a prominent figure of the administration - was mentioned at least 36 times in the CIA's damning report on the use torture as a means of interrogation, according to NBC News's investigative reporter Matthew Cole. 

But despite identifying other officials, report authors opted to shroud the woman from the public sphere, only revealing that she is 49 years old and formerly the deputy chief of the bin Laden unit.

Key figure: The now 49-year-old al Qaeda expert was mentioned 36 times in the CIA damning torture report

The 528-page report concluded that none of the confessions drawn from tortured detainees amounted to significant life-saving intelligence.

However, one passage recounts how the al Qaeda expert told a Senate committee: 'There's no question, in my mind, that having that detainee information has saved hundreds, conservatively speaking, of American lives.'

Her statement came after she had personally waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of al Qaeda's leading operatives who was detained in Poland.

And when another detainee stated that Mohammed tried to recruited two Black American Muslim converts in Afghanistan, she falsely told CIA officials he was targeting any US national Muslims.

She closed the email with the words: 'i love the Black American Muslim at AQ camps in Afghanuistan (sic). ... Mukie (KSM) is going to be hatin' life on this one'.

When she was interviewed about the interrogations in 2003, and claimed they drew life-saving intelligence that led to an arrest, the Senate report stated: 'These representations were almost entirely inaccurate.'

By this point, the expert was deputy chief of ALEC Station, also known as the bin Laden unit.

She has now surpassed the civilian rank of general. 

Track record: One passage reveals how she waterboarded alleged 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 

The expert reached this level despite facing a storm of criticism in 2001.

A member of her team refused to tell the FBI the names of Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi - two of the 9/11 suicide terrorists.

The expert was fiercely condemned for the blunder. 

Despite CIA's fierce bid to protect the expert's identity, she has been named before, NBC News reveals. According to the station, she was one of a number of women who inspired Jessica Chastain's character in Zero Dark Thirty - the Hollywood retelling of Osama bin Laden's killing.

However, the administration implored NBC to refrain from identifying the woman for fear of retaliation.

A former senior CIA officer, John Maguire, told NBC: 'She's an extraordinarily capable analyst.

'She has a caustic personality, but she is frighteningly intelligent and knows more about al Qaeda than virtually anyone else at the CIA.

'She's hard to manage but brings a lot to the table... She wasn't afraid to make mistakes.'
