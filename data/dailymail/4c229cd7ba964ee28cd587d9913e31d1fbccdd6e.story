Bill Clinton likes $550 wristwatches so much that he has bought 14 of them to give away as presents, he told a Denver audience on Wednesday.

The former president will receive $944,000 in pension and benefits from taxpayers this year and spent $7,700 on the watches, not counting the two he owns himself.

In the run-up to the 2016 elections he and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are trying desperately to distance themselves from charges that they've become wealthy elites.

'You want one too?' Bill Clinton pointed to his $550 Shinola watch on Wednesday after a panel discussion with Chipotle Mexican Grill Co-CEO Monty Moran

Time on his hands: WHen the former president is running late for a $500,000 speaking gig, he checks this Shinola 'Runwell' watch -- one with a tan band and another in black

Bill fed that narrative Wednesday in Denver during a Q&A session at the annual meeting of his Clinton Global Initiative.

Asked about a rumor about his spending splurge during an April 26 visit to the Shinola watch factory in Detroit, Clinton chuckled as he explained how he bought five watches last year to give as Christmas presents, and another nine this year.

The stunned Q&A moderator turned to the audience and said he hadn't known the story was true.

'I had no idea,' he deadpanned. 'I thought I was just pulling his leg.'

The Daily Caller reported that Clinton said the group he was traveling with in Detroit bought as many as 30 of the timepieces.

He already owned two of the Shinola 'Runwell' watches – the leather bands are different colors – and a factory employee gave him a third in April, with the Presidential Seal engraved on the back.

When he visited the Detroit watch-assembly facility, according to Crain's Detroit Business, Clinton called the watch 'elegant and informal,' adding that the Runwell model's large numbers help him with his flagging eyesight.

Shinola is America's most prolific producer of watches, which are more often made in Europe and Asia. It also produces bicycles, leather goods, journals, leather goods and pet toys.

Its name comes from a World War II expression that name-checked the Shinola brand of show polish.

A common put-down in the U.S. at the time was, 'You don't know s**t from Shinola.'

The company acquired the trademark in 2011.

'Not out of touch': Bill Clinton's spending sprees aren't helping his wife Hillary reposition herself as a woman of the people in advance of an expected run for president in 2016

Yes, THAT Shinola: The watch company's namesake used to be a shoe polish that inspired the insult 'You don't know s**t from Shinola'

Despite a taxpayer-funded lifestlye, a reported $500,000 standard speaking fee and a growing collection of expensive timepieces, former President Clinton insisted on Tuesday during an NBC News interview that he and his wife are normal people.

'I think I had the lowest net worth of any American President in the 20th century when I took office,' he claimed.

Twenty-two years later, the Clintons are the wealthiest living former first couple.

'We’ve got a good life, and I’m grateful for it. But we go to our local grocery store on the weekend. We talk to people in our town. We know what’s going on.'

Hillary Clinton said Wednesday during an interview with PBS that comparing her wealth to that of Mitt Romney, the super-rich Republican presidential candidate in 2012, would be 'a false equivalency.'

She earns a reported $225,000 per speaking engagement, including a planned autumn appearance at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, a school that has nearly tripled tuition costs in the past decade.

One student there told MailOnline that Mrs. Clinton's anticipated payday is 'obscene ... maybe they should book someone else who won't add to the reasons we're paying more for school.'
