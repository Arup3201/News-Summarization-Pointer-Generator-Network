BT's other screening in April will be on Saturday April 11 when Swansea City host Roberto Martinez's Everton at the Liberty Stadium.

However, Sky Sports will celebrate securing a number of blockbuster Premier League fixtures for April as the season reaches its climax.

The feather in the cap is the Manchester derby, but Sky have also gained the rights to show all four of Manchester City's fixtures in April as the champions look to gain ground on leaders Chelsea.  

And despite Jose Mourinho's feud with Sky last month, all of the Blues' five league matches in the penultimate month of the Premier League season will be shown on Sky. 

The month kicks off as they host Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday Night Football and also includes box office matches with Manchester United and Arsenal. 

Sky's other 16 live Premier League matches in April include two showings of Sean Dyche's Burnley as they host Spurs on Sunday 5 and Arsenal on Saturday 11, as the Clarets look to beat the drop. 

The announcement of April's live showings comes after Sky admitted to 'paying big' after BT tried to 'muscle in' on the TV rights. 

BT Sport won the rights to show Arsenal vs Liverpool, Everton's visit to Swansea and Southampton's match against Tottenham Hotspur 

Sky had accused BT Sport of trying to 'muscle in' on the Premier League bidding process
