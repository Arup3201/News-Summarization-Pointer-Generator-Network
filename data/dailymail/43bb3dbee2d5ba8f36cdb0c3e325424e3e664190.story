Pep Guardiola has been labelled disrespectful by Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic. 

The Croatia centre forward also claims that Guardiola dropped him from the German Cup final last season because he didn't want him to finish as Bayern Munich's top scorer for the season.

Mandzukic still topped the scoring charts with 26 goals for Bayern but was sold to Atletico in the summer.

'Guardiola disappointed me because he didn't treat me with respect and it was twice as good when Jupp Heynckes (Bayern coach's before Guardiola) until was there,' Mandzukic said In an interview with Sportske Novosti.

'Would I sit down with Guardiola for a coffee? That is something that's not going to happen.

'In my professional life I don't have to like everyone but if I feel a negative energy coming from a person then I try to avoid them.

'I didn't deserve to be treated like that after giving everything for Bayern for two seasons. I felt that things would change for me just as he [Guardiola] arrived.

'I struggled to adapt to him but in the end you need both parties to make a success of something.

'I realised there was no future for me there so I resigned myself to leaving the club and had time to choose a new destination.'

Referring to his omission from the 16-man squad for the cup final against Borussia Dortmund, which Bayern won 2-0, Mandzukic added: 'Guardiola decided not to play me because he didn't want me to finish as leading goalscorer, so he did not let me play towards the end of the season.

'It wasn't really important but it did show the lack of respect he had towards me.

'It would have made much more sense if he had told me I didn't fit into his style of play.'

Mandzukic has scored six goals for Atletico since moving from Bayern.
