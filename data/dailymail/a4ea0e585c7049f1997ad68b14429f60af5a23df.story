Bayern Munich progressed to the Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday night as Roma 'did a Liverpool' and rested several first-team stars.

With Bayern cruising at the top of Group E Roma manager Rudi Garcia left captain Francesco Totti on the bench along with first-team regulars Ashley Cole, Gervinho, Miralem Pjanic and goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis. 

The move by Roma - who face Torino in Serie A on Sunday - drew similarities with that of Brendan Rodgers decision to field a weakened Liverpool side for their trip to Real Madrid on Tuesday night.

German champions Bayern never looked troubled by their weakened opposition as Franck Ribery and Mario Gotze scored either side of half time to register their fourth win from four European games.

The result gives Bayern an unassailable eight-point lead at the top of the group while Roma remain second following Manchester City's surprise defeat by CSKA Moscow.

Bayern went ahead in the 38th minute, when Ribery sent David Alaba racing down the left flank. The Austria international played the ball back to Ribery and the winger slotted home, with the ball bouncing off the inside of the post into the net.

Gotze secured Bayern's victory in the 64th minute after a cross from Robert Lewandowski. Gotze displayed outstanding control to lift the ball softly past Roma goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski.

'No, not yet,' Guardiola, in his second season at Bayern, told reporters when asked if this team was now matching his expectations.

'We are playing better than last year but we have to improve,' said Guardiola, who won the domestic double with Bayern in his first season in charge.

'Obviously we are playing better. We talk a lot, we have a lot of meetings, but we can always improve, always, always.'

Bayern captain Philipp Lahm said: 'We knew it wouldn't be that easy as in Rome. They defended well, often with six men, and it wasn't easy to create chances.'

Ribery, starting only his second match after a knee injury, said Roma defended well in the first half, when Bayern had few chances apart from the goal.

'But we played better in the second half and it's been a nice week for us,' Ribery said.

Lahm narrowly missed the target and a chance to make it a three-goal lead and Alaba's free kick sailed wide. 

Gervinho came on late in the game and created Roma's only decent opportunity, setting up Radja Nainggolan, but Manuel Neuer produced an outstanding save to deny the former Arsenal man.

Bayern were never forced to switch into a higher gear and Roma rarely managed to hold the ball long enough to threaten the German champion.

Guardiola's team became the first German side to make sure of winning a Champions League group with two matches to spare.
