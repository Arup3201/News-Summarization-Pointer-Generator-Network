The battle for Britain’s living rooms intensified yesterday with the UK launch of film-rental service Netflix.

The U.S. firm offers subscribers a library of thousands of movies and TV programmes that can be streamed over the internet to televisions, computers or smartphones for just £5.99 a month.

In comparison, Sky charges £16 a month for its bundle of movie channels, while Virgin Media charges £21.50. The fees come on top of basic subscription packages for set-top boxes and TV channels.

How you can use Netflix to watch movies

Netflix could pose a threat to both companies, as well as other internet services such as Lovefilm, which is owned by Amazon.

Films from Netflix (and Lovefilm) are available to watch on computers, tablets, smartphones and newer internet-enabled televisions, and can also be streamed on normal TVs through an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 games console. Netflix customers can watch in their living rooms using a Nintendo Wii or Apple’s iTV set-top box, too.

The launch could put further pressure on Britain’s broadband infrastructure, which may struggle to cope if Netflix becomes a hit. This is because customers stream its films to their homes each time a movie is watched, instead of downloading and storing it for later.

Subscription: £5.99 per month

Works on: iPhone, iPad, Android phones and tablets Xbox 360, Wii, PCs, Macs, Samsung Smart TV and LG home cinema systems

Requires broadband internet

Unlimited access to films and TV shows

There is already evidence that the popularity of the BBC’s online 
streaming service, iPlayer, means that other web users experience slower
internet speeds at peak times.

Netflix’s success in the U.S. – where it accounts for about a third of 
internet use – has led to some internet service providers capping their 
customer’s usage, or introducing higher charges for heavy users.

The future of on-demand streaming services in the UK will largely depend
on which films and TV programmes they can secure the rights to.

Netflix, which already has 20million subscribers worldwide, should have 
enough financial muscle to build its business in Britain. It has signed 
digital licensing deals with the BBC and Hollywood studios such as MGM, 
Miramax and Lionsgate, and is offering potential customers a free 
one-month trial. While initially its library looks limited, once 
established, it hopes to offer the latest films for streaming as soon as
they become available on DVD.

Lovefilm, which already has two million UK customers, according to 
Amazon, reacted to Netflix’s launch by announcing a £4.99-a-month 
package for unlimited streaming.

Sky has responded to the emergence of both companies by making its TV 
and film services available on a subscription basis over the internet as
well.
