A New York firm has revealed ambitious plans to send a spacecraft to Mars to bring back dust from the atmosphere in 2018.

The BoldlyGo Institute - a new, privately funded, not-for-profit organization, is hoping to attract a billion dollars from donors to fund the mission - beating Nasa to the red planet in the process.

It also plans to launch a space telescope to hunt for alien life.

The mission could launch in 2018, and will involve a daring high-speed atmospheric pass down to below 40 km altitude.

Once in the Martian atmosphere, 'ears' will appear, giving the craft solar power. One contains the gel it will use to capture particles from 40km above the surface.

The mission could launch in 2018, and will involve a daring high-speed atmospheric pass down to below 40 km altitude.

The mission is timed to coincide with seasonal Martian dust storms, collecting thousands of precious Martian dust particles from the atmosphere.

Particles will be collected in a gel, similar to the one recently used to capture particles from a comet.

After the sample collection pass at Mars, the spacecraft returns directly to Earth, where its precious, sterilized samples descend by parachute to the ground.

The first of the missions BoldlyGo intends to pursue is Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars (SCIM), a Mars flyby mission that would dive deep into the martian atmosphere.

The spacecraft would collect atmospheric dust during that flyby and return it to Earth after skimming just 40km form the surface of the red planet during a dust storm.

The SCIM mission concept dates back more than a decade to when it was a finalist for NASA’s first Mars Scout mission, a competition won by the Phoenix Mars Lander.

The mission could launch in 2018, and will involve a daring high-speed atmospheric pass down to below 40 km altitude.

The mission is timed to coincide with seasonal Martian dust storms, collecting thousands of precious Martian dust particles from the atmosphere.

After the sample collection pass at Mars, the spacecraft returns directly to Earth, where its precious, sterilized samples descend by parachute to the ground. 

Laurie Leshin, the principal investigator for the original SCIM proposal, said at a recent meeting that the organization was working with industry partner Lockheed Martin to update the mission concept.

'The Sample Collection to Investigate Mars will return the first samples of Martian materials to Earth without the complexity and risk of landing, and at a fraction of the cost,' the firm said.

'As the first round trip mission to Mars, SCIM will break new ground, and set the stage for future visits to Mars by humans.

'SCIM will fundamentally advance our knowledge of the geology, climate and habitability of Mars, a terrestrial planet that may have been similar to Earth in its early history.

'As the first sample return from another terrestrial planet, SCIM will provide a unique data set and a comparative basis for understanding how the rocky inner planets formed and why they have evolved so differently from each other.'

The craft will make its way back to Earth with the sterilised samples on board

It will use a parachute to touch down - and samples from the Martian atmosphere will then be distributed to labs around the world

The second project is a novel space telescope for the post-Hubble era called Astro-1.

Dr. Jon Morse, chief executive officer of BGI, said: 'The future of space science is at a critical juncture in the United States and around the globe.

'We know how important and exciting this kind of research is, but the unfortunate reality is that government funding for space science is falling, even while public interest in space remains high.

'BoldlyGo Institute will play a leading role in advancing this NewSpace Science movement, aimed at nothing less than incredible discoveries.'

The organisation cited cuts in Nasa funding for its existence.

'This is a challenging yet exciting time in the planetary and space sciences, with limited government funding for space missions but also some new opportunities through private and commercial avenues,' said Dr Meenakshi Wadhwa, Director of the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University and a BGI board member.

'The current model leaves a tremendous amount of frontier science on the cutting room floor.We are compelled to explore new ways to advance our scientific goals, and I believe that the model we have created with BoldlyGo Institute will do just that."
