Stephen Lawrence is buried in a remote location in the rural highlands of Jamaica, his mother has revealed.

The family chose to lay him to rest alongside his great-grandmother in a secluded spot near where Doreen Lawrence used to play as as a child.

However, the exact location of the grave
remains a fiercely guarded secret, she said, to allow her to visit him 
in peace and quietly reflect.

She told the BBC's Panorama programme that his family feared his grave would be desecrated if it was in the UK.

Private grief: Stephen's grave is in a secret location in Jamaica, next to that of his great-grandmother

Resting place: Stephen Lawrence's mother says her son is buried in the Caribbean because Britain 'didn't deserve to have him'

Fading: Mrs Lawrence said it will soon be time to change the photo of her son on the grave

Mrs Lawrence, who came to the UK at the age of nine, said: 'Here nobody knows where he is.

'Then 
again, I don't think the country deserves to have his body there anyway 
because they took his life.

'I think it's still the best thing we did, that we brought him here so he can be next to his great-grandmother so she can look after him.'

She added: 'I am really pleased I have 
buried him here, because had he been buried in the UK his grave would 
have been desecrated so many times.'

The grave bears a picture of her murdered son which will soon be replaced because it is fading, Mrs Lawrence said.

In the programme Mrs Lawrence looks through pictures of Stephen as a child and says she is protective of his memory.

She says: 'I don't like the idea of too many 
photos of Stephen being out. I just think everybody seems to want to 
have photos of him and I just think "no".

'The one is enough, that way you have some control.'

Mrs Lawrence can also be seen looking at Stephen's cap and jumper, complete with badges, from when he was a cub and scout.

She leafs through some of his writings but says she still cannot bring herself to read them.

'I came across this. He did it on April 7, 15 days before he died he did it,' she says.

'I can't read it, I find it difficult, when I look at what he could achieve. I'm not ready to read this yet.'

Yesterday there was finally some justice for her son after an 18-year ordeal.

As well as the immeasurable grief and anger caused by the murder of her son, she and her husband Neville, their marriage already under strain, were finally driven apart by Stephen's death.

As the verdicts on Gary Dobson and David Norris were returned the Lawrences sat ten feet apart, but wept at exactly the same time.

Police set up a mobile surveillance van to prevent Stephen Lawrence’s memorial plaque being vandalised yesterday.

The van positioned its cameras on the black marble dedication that marks the spot where he died on Well Hall Road, Eltham, South East London in 1993.It came after a string of racial abuse was aimed at mourners who came to leave flowers on Tuesday by passing motorists after Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of his murder.

Police patrolled the road fearing another racist attack could be carried out on the memorial.

Dozens of flowers were laid around the memorial – mostly by people who did not know the 18-year-old A-level student.

The plaque has been targeted three times in the 16 years since it was positioned at the site of the stabbing.

On one occasion it was chipped and it has also had paint and flammable liquids poured on it.

After the two men had been found guilty,
Doreen Lawrence was applauded as she read a statement outside the Old 
Bailey.

But this wasn’t a cause for celebration, she said.

‘How can I celebrate when my son lies
buried? When I cannot see him or speak to him?

'When will I see him grow
up and go to university or get married or have children? These verdicts
will not bring my son back.

‘How can I celebrate when I know that
this day could have come 18 years ago if the police, who were meant to 
find my son’s killers, had not failed so miserably to do so?'

Of Stephen she said: ‘I now want 
people to remember him as a bright, beautiful young man who any parent 
of whatever background would have been proud of.

‘He was a wonderful son and a shining
example of what any parent would want in a child.

'I miss him with a 
passion. Hopefully now he can rest in peace.’

When she visited Stephen's grave in March she told the BBC that when she returned she would like to be able to tell him that someone had gone to prison for his death.

At least now she can.

He was 18 and on the brink of fulfilling his ambition to train as an architect.

In
school he was a promising student; outside, a burgeoning athlete. By 
the time six weeks of evidence came to a close at the Old Bailey, the 
jury knew everything about Stephen Lawrence’s death, right down to the 
angle the knife was plunged into his chest.

They
knew virtually nothing about his life. Remarkably, they were never even
shown his photograph. In truth, his story is unremarkable – but one 
which illustrates how a single act of  violence snatched away a young 
man’s future and devastated an ordinary, decent family.

The
oldest of three children, Stephen was born on September 13, 1974. His 
brother Stuart is two years younger and sister Georgina six years 
younger.

The brothers 
squabbled like any teenage siblings, but remained close. Days before he 
died, Stephen had forgiven Stuart for dismantling his Sony Walkman to 
see how it worked.

Stuart, 
now a teacher, has previously said: ‘It was great having a big brother. 
No-one messed with me. Stephen was tall and cool and had lots of 
friends.’

When the 
children were growing up, the Lawrences did everything as a family. They
attended the local Trinity Methodist Church, where Stephen volunteered 
to help old people. The family ate together around the table when 
possible and went on traditional English holidays.

At
the time Stephen was murdered he was doing A-levels at Blackheath 
Bluecoat School, where he was popular, gregarious, confident. He was 
never known to have caused a fight. Rio Ferdinand, later to become a 
Manchester United and England soccer star, was a fellow pupil. Ferdinand
was a few years below Stephen, but Stephen, a keen Arsenal fan, knew 
him through their mutual interest in football.

In any case, he was the kind of 
figure that new pupils would look up to. When first years arrived, it 
was Stephen whom teachers chose as part of the team that showed them 
around. They regarded him as a role model and knew his easy manner would
make youngsters feel at ease.

He
wasn’t an angel, of course, and during his mid-teens his parents were 
worried he wasn’t working hard enough. Later, he realised how important 
his exams would be and got back on track. Had his path not crossed with a
group of thugs, he would have made a success of his life.

‘As a young boy Stephen was never a problem,’ his father Neville said.

‘He
had worked out what he wanted to do in life.’

He was a quick learner by
all accounts, and very talented at drawing. An architect where Stephen 
did work experience offered to take him on when he passed his exams.

Even
at 18 he was quite industrious – he designed and made T-shirts 
featuring drawings and cartoon characters, and sold them with a friend 
to shops in Camden Town. He also took a part-time job in McDonald’s.

Like his father, who had been a 
champion distance-runner, Stephen was a good athlete. He was 
comparatively short at 5ft 8in but sprinted 100metres for Cambridge 
Harriers and was the second fastest among his age group. The fact that 
he didn’t try to flee the gang is one of the enduring mysteries of what 
happened that night.

Stephen’s
father, Neville, had wanted to be an architect too. But growing up in 
Jamaica, he was so poor that he had to go to work at 14, and he became 
an upholsterer.

Hence, the family hoped Stephen would realise his father’s unfulfilled dream.

At
one point Stephen, who was taken to Jamaica as a baby, even considered 
going back to the Caribbean to forge a career there. Instead, the island
was to become his final resting place because his family feared his 
grave would be attacked by racists if it was in England.

His
mother, Doreen, told the BBC’s Panorama: ‘I am really pleased I have 
buried him here, because had he been buried in the UK his grave would 
have been desecrated so many times.

‘Here
nobody knows where he is. Then again, I don’t think the country 
deserves to have his body there anyway because they took his life.

‘I
think it’s still the best thing we did, that we brought him here so he 
can be next to his great-grandmother so she can look after him.’
