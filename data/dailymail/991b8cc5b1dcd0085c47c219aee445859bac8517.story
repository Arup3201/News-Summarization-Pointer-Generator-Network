Andy Carroll's fiance, Billi Mucklow has shared her first pregnancy scan photo on her official Instagram account.  

The 26-year-old, best known for her time on reality TV show The Only Way is Essex, is clearly excited and captioned the snap, 'Can't wait to cuddle and kiss my little Bubba!' 

The post earned nearly 7000 'likes' and drew countless well wishes from fans.

While Carroll already has two children from a previous relationship - four-year-old daughter Emily Rose and two-year-old son Lucas, this will be Mucklow's first child.

The couple announced their engagement last year after the West Ham striker orchestrated an extravagant proposal to Mucklow outside the Colosseum in Rome. 

Earlier in his career, Carroll had developed something of a bad boy reputation off the pitch, but now seems to have settled down. 

He has been in good form for West Ham this season and has five goals in 12 Premier League games.
