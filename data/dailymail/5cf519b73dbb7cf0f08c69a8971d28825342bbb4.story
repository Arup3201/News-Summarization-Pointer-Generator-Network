‘We had a response from his surgeon to say that in about a month's time he can cope with professional training,’ said Pardew.

‘So we are not rushing him in any shape or form, just letting Jonas have some time because it's such an illness that you do need a lot of recovery time for that.

‘But he's in great shape. Colo (Fabricio Coloccini) tells me he is in good form and we are looking forward to seeing him.

‘It's massive news for the squad because he is a much-loved figure here.’

Gutierrez was first diagnosed with the illness in 2013 and had a testicle removed in October of last year. However, he has been receiving chemotherapy since the summer after a check-up revealed inflammation in his groin.

But the popular winger is now free to resume training with the Magpies having not featured since last October in black and white.
