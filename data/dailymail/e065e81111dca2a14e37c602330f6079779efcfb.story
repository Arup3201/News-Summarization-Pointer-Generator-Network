The brother of Moors Murders victim Keith Bennett has described Ian Brady’s confidante as ‘sick’ and ‘twisted’ following allegations that she concealed a letter that may reveal the whereabouts of the 12-year-old’s remains.

Alan Bennett said the killer’s self-styled mental health advocate Jackie Powell had ‘a very empty soul, just like Brady’ and ought to be locked up with him.

Mr Bennett, 52, was speaking after the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in which Miss Powell, 48, described being given a sealed envelope by Brady addressed to Keith and Alan’s mother, Winnie Johnson, who died at the weekend.

Mrs Johnson had dedicated her life to finding where Brady and Myra Hindley buried her son, who vanished in 1964.

He is the only one of the pair’s five victims whose body has not been found.

Last week, police responded to publicity about the documentary by raiding Miss Powell’s home and arresting her on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body. No letter was found.

Miss Powell disclosed its existence while being interviewed for the documentary, Endgames of a Psychopath, which was shown on Monday.

Mr Bennett branded her ‘nothing more than another sick friend to Brady’, adding on his website: ‘Jackie Powell, you are . . . a self-important, callous twisted individual with no heart and a very empty soul, just like Brady.’

He said Miss Powell and former religious studies teacher Dr Alan Keighley, another Brady confidant interviewed in the film, ‘should be in Ashworth [the secure hospital where Brady is held] themselves’.

Miss Powell was unavailable for comment yesterday. She has claimed that she told police about Brady’s letter two weeks before her arrest, but officers from the cold case unit were not interested.

‘It is no surprise at all that Brady was/is willing to sit and talk to the likes of these people,’ he wrote.

‘They should be in Ashworth themselves or some other institution to try and help with their problems, although they may well be beyond any help at all.’ And he concluded: ‘Powell and Keighley you are both a total and utter disgrace.

‘You sicken and disgust me more than I could ever say, just like the rest of the Brady’s sympathisers and friends.’

Mr Bennett backed the decision to broadcast the film so soon after his mother’s death and said it had demonstrated how Brady had ‘conned’ so many people during his long incarceration.

At the weekend he criticised Greater Manchester Police’s refusal to relaunch the hunt for his brother’s remains, branding their vow to resume the search if they received significant new information ‘pointless platitudes’.

Meanwhile Action for Advocacy - which provides support for mental health advocates - said Miss Powell’s conduct breached its guidelines.

Chief executive Martin Coyle said Ashworth had questions to answer about the level of access to Brady she had been given for the past 13 years and how she was apparently able to smuggle a letter out.

He added that her role as an executor of Brady’s will represented ‘a big conflict of interest’.

‘Either she had a formal role, which would involve someone supervising her, and which apparently didn’t happen, or she’d be better described as a long-term visitor or friend,’ he said.

Mr Coyle criticised Channel 4 for not querying her claim to be Brady’s formal mental health advocate, saying her behaviour ‘tarnished’ the reputation of thousands of well-intentioned professionals.

The health of 74-year-old Brady is reported to be fading after 13 years on hunger strike, with injuries he sustained after a seizure at the secure hospital in Merseyside last month meaning he is now too ill to be force-fed.

Keith was on his way to visit his grandmother’s house in Longsight, Manchester when he vanished on June 16, 1964.

His mother died at a hospice on Saturday after a long battle with cancer without being informed of the latest developments in the hunt for his body.

Miss Powell was unavailable for comment yesterday.

She has previously alleged that she told police about Brady’s letter two weeks before her arrest but officers from the cold case unit were not interested.
