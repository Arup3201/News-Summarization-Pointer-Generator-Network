Fifteen crew members of the South Korean ferry which sank, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing, have gone on trial.

Captain Lee Joon-seok, 68, and three senior crew have been charged with homicide - a charge that could carry the death penalty.

Two other crew members have been charged with fleeing and abandoning ship, with a maximum sentence of life in prison, while nine have been charged with negligence, which can also carry jail terms.

The Sewol sank off the southwest coast on April 16 on a routine journey from Incheon on the mainland to the southern holiday island of Jeju.

Of the 476 passengers and crew on board, 339 were children and teachers from the same school on the outskirts of Seoul.

Only 172 people were rescued and the remainder are all presumed to have drowned.

Members of the crew were caught on video abandoning ship, the captain in his underwear, while the children, obeying orders, waited in their cabins for further instructions.

As the defendants were led in to court today someone shouted: 'That guy is the captain, isn't he? Murderer!'

One relative held up a sign that read: 'You are not human. You are beneath animals.' An altercation arose between the relatives and security guards who tried to take the sign away.

Mourning family members packed the court in Gwangju, the closest city to the scene of the disaster, as the 15 were led in and seated on two rows of benches.

The 15 have been in detention since they were charged in May.

In a statement sent to reporters via text message and read out by a representative before the hearing, a committee of ferry victims' families demanded strict punishment of the crew.

'They say wounds heal as time goes by, but, for us, it's like time has stopped,' the statement said.

'The defendants, who should have saved the passengers first, ran out first and lived... The defendants not only killed the passengers, they also killed the souls of the families and basic trust in our society.'

All surviving crew members responsible for the ship's navigation have been charged with negligence and with failing to do their duty to protect passengers.

Sounds of sobs were heard throughout the courtroom as the state presented its case and the head prosecutor's voice broke as he recounted the last moments of some of the children.

One child was caught on video, recovered later, staring death in the face, the prosecutor said.

'I'm not a criminal, I don't know why this is happening,' the child said. 'I haven't done anything that bad.'

A Gwangju judge who handles media affairs, Hahn Jee-hyung, said the defendants were unlikely to get a full and concerted defence in the highly publicised case.

'The state-appointed lawyers have taken on the case out of public interest and not of their own will,' Hahn told reporters before the hearing got under way.

'They were appointed by the court, so we hope there is no criticism of them.'

A panel of three judges presided on the first day of the trial, as the state called for justice to be served and the seven defence lawyers presented their case.

South Korea has in recent years revised its criminal law to allow defendants to opt for jury trials, but most of the 15 crew members chose against it.

The captain and one senior crew member had written to the court pleading leniency, court documents show, but details were not available.

the passengers first, ran out first and lived... The defendants not only
 killed the passengers, they also killed the souls of the families and 
basic trust in our society'

Authorities are still searching for Yoo Byung-un, head of the family that owned the operator of the doomed ferry, on charges of embezzlement seen as a key factor that led to compromised safety management.

The captain and three other crew members are charged with homicide - a charge that could carry the death penalty, though South Korea has not executed anyone since late 1997.

Prosecutors accuse them of tacitly colluding to abandon the ship while being aware that the passengers would be trapped and killed when the ship sank.

President Park Geun-hye has called the crew's actions murderous, and the pervading hostility against them has raised questions about the fairness of the trial. The crew is being defended by state-appointed lawyers, three of whom started practicing law only this year.

The court said in a statement that it will guarantee the rights of both the defendants and the victims and faithfully investigate evidence for a speedy and fair trial.

Nearly two months after the sinking, 292 bodies have been recovered and 12 people are still missing.

Divers continue underwater searches for those believed trapped inside the sunken ship off the country's southwestern coast.

There are allegations that the ferry operator, Chonghaejin Marine Co., dangerously overloaded the vessel and gave crew members inadequate emergency training, and some company officials also have been arrested.

The absence of determined defence may mean that the crew's side of the story - whether, for instance, they were adequately trained or whether they were given strict orders to abandon ship - may never be heard in court.

One lawyer, appearing for one of the crew in hearings held behind closed doors to decide the validity of arrest warrants, confessed to being torn between professional obligation and the resignation that lawyers could not make any difference amid a nationwide witch hunt.

'It is a burden for every lawyer, because the crime is something that can hardly be forgiven,' he said in the small coastal town of Mokpo last month.

'It's not just that one person died. There were hundreds. All I could say to the judges is "we will await your wise decision". That was it.'

There also is widespread anger and frustration with the government over what many see as an incompetent search and rescue effort. Since the sinking, President Park has pushed to restructure government agencies and reshuffle top officials to try to restore public confidence.

On Tuesday, Park nominated a former senior journalist as her new prime minister. The outgoing prime minister has resigned to take responsibility for the government's handling of the sinking.

Tuesday's appointment comes nearly two weeks after Park's first choice for the job resigned amid allegations of ethical lapses. She also appointed the country's ambassador to Japan as the new spy chief, according to the presidential Blue House.
