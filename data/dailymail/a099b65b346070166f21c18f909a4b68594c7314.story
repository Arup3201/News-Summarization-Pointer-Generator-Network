When a thief repeatedly stole money from the till in their old-fashioned sweet shop, the owners came up with an ingenious plan to catch him.

Placing concealed cameras among the jars, Jane and Neil Hutton waited in silence at Beehive Treats in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to catch the thief in the act.

Dubbing  their sting 'Operation Rhubarb and Custard', the couple also set 'booby traps' 
including rubbish-filled bin bags, bottles of cleaning products and cans
of cream soda to make a noise.

Detectives: Neil and Jane Hutton caught an employee stealing from the till at their sweet shop after placing cameras among the jars

And the couple eventually got their man, catching employee Oliver Longstaff in the act, a court heard.

Longstaff, 20, was given 'the shock of a lifetime' after battling through the series of obstacles to raid the till - only to find them lying in wait.

Wycombe Magistrates' Court heard that
Longstaff, an aspiring actor and former grammar school pupil, was 
stealing to pay off gambling debts which had spiralled out of control.

He had amassed debts of £545 and been visited by debt collectors.

His solicitor Stephen Toghill said: 'It was the panic caused by this debt collector turning up at his home.

Caught out: Oliver Longstaff was taking the money from the till to help pay off a gambling debt following a visit from a debt collector

'Basically he wanted to try and get some money quickly and he saw an easy option.'

Longstaff,
who is due to go to drama school next month, had intended to re-gamble 
the cash to pay off the debt - but lost it again betting.

The court heard that Longstaff had crept out of the store room at the shop before the couple rushed him and locked the door until police arrived.

It was a successful end to almost a week of detective work, triggered 
after they became suspicious about cash seemingly disappearing from the 
float left in the till overnight.

They chose to place the cameras to catch the thief in the act and after identifying Longstaff, they vowed to catch him red handed.

Mr Hutton, 47, said: 'At every stage there were little traps, things that would tell us exactly where he was and what he was doing.

'First the Victorian shop bell rang as someone came in and then there was the sound of the Windowlene bottle being knocked over by the first till.

'Next came the rustling of someone fighting through full bin bags in the dark and then, and this was not in the plan, the sounds of the loo being used and flushed.

'We had to desperately stop ourselves from laughing.

'Next he tripped over the cans of cream soda placed to distract him as he approached our hiding place.'

However Mr Hutton also defended Longstaff. He said: 'He was charming and seemingly well-liked by everybody.

'We were disappointed because we have always invested in the young people of Marlow, who have been fantastic, and for one to go the other way is a shock.'

Longstaff, who pleaded guilty to burglary, was handed a 12-month supervision order which involves him seeking treatment for his 'gambling problem'.

He was also ordered to do 40 hours' unpaid work, pay £85 court costs and pay £158 to Beehive Treats - the amount of money he stole that night.

Sentencing Longstaff, magistrate Sandra Connor said: 'You are young and we believe it is your youth and lack of experience leading you along.

'Nonetheless, you betrayed your family and your employer's trust.'

Outside court, Longstaff said it had been a 'really tough time' for him but wanted a fresh start.

He said he hoped he could put it behind him and 'appear on screen one day'.
