From the surgeon hoping it will help train a new generation of doctors, to the Iron Man triathlete saying it allows him to go faster, Google Glass users of all kinds came together on Saturday night to discuss both the future and the bothers with the first stages of the controversial 'wearable technology'.

'Glass Night Out' events were held in eight cities across America - Boston, Los Angeles, Madison, Milwaukee, New York, Orlando, Palo Alto and Washington, D.C. - to encourage dialogue among 'explorers' -  the techies who subscribed to the $1500 test version of the eyewear, known as the 'explorer edition'.

The 'explorers' are Google's guinea pigs as they continue to work on the software to make Glass more readily available to the public - with early complaints the batteries are only lasting 30 minutes - while most of the explorers are themselves developers planning to create their own concepts to introduce via Google Glass as the concept moves forward, such as creating iPhone-like applications.

For explorers like Allen Firstenberg, 43, of Poughkeepsie, who attended a Glass event in New York's East Village, the initial technology Google implemented has already changed his day-to-day life.

'I never used to send texts before, 
because I found it so laborious to do on a phone, but with Glass I send 
texts all the time, because it's so easy,' he told The Mail Online.

'I just say who I'm sending it
 to and what I want it to say, and as soon I stop talking, Glass knows to send.

'Just like smartphones did, Glass has allowed for a whole new way of thinking about computers.

'We call PC's the personal computer, well this is the new PC.

'There's something very convenient and natural seeing your emails and alerts popping up in front of you, rather than having to get out your phone and flip.'

Adam Kushner, 33, who also works in IT, is an ultra-distance qualifier for Iron Man triathlons, and uses his Glass while in cycle training to measure the amount of energy he is using in his rear tyre.

Furthermore, the tiny operating screen in the right lens has helped with his lazy eye.

'I've had problems with my right eye for a while and my left is much stronger, but Glass has, strangely, helped it,' Kushner said.

General surgeon Jonny Reall, 39, is in the process of developing a way to use Glass as a teacher tool for medical students in the operating room.

'I can't give too much of it away, because obviously I'm working on this, but it's about being able to visualize what you're doing on a table while having an aid in the Glass, that you're able to look at while you're in surgery,' he said.

Graphic designer Parker Boeb, 28, from New York, said while he uses Glass mostly for personal use, he has started sending photos of projects to his clients.

'But mostly I use it to take pictures, and I take a lot of pictures with it, which I use for inspiration at work,' he said.

Klaus Bandisch, 59, a freelance web developer who has previously worked for Apple and Google, said people have accused him of filming them when he isn't.

'Ofcourse I'm not, but this is New York - show me somewhere you're not being filmed,' he said.

Upon the release of the second-generation Glass, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program - about 6,000 people - will able to 'invite' three of their friends to join the scheme.

Google are rumored to be working on facial recognition, a zoom-in camera and live internet streaming for the sophomore edition.

Google is hoping its Explorer faithful will help 'dispel Glass myths to all'

Google
 recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass 
wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude'
 for wearing the device.

The
 firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and 
warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much.

The
 guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the 
$1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year.

'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said.

'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about.

'Reactions
 range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do 
they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see 
into my soul?!'

Reaction to the new design has been mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky.

Google
 has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has 
developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses,
 and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames.

The 'Glass Night Out' is part of a continued effort to reduce the polarizing effect of the glass headsets, which let users snap photos, shoot video, perform a search and do lots of other smartphone-like tasks in front of their eyes.

The idea of a computer and recording device on one's head has made some non-Glass users uncomfortable, and it has pushed the conversation about etiquette and social norms in a connected world.

Establishments including bars and movie theaters have kicked out Explorers (whom critics call 'Glassholes').

In February, Google released an etiquette guide explaining how users can avoid being labeled a 'Glasshole' when strutting around with the headware.

The company followed up with a post in March about the "top 10 myths" about Glass, which include the idea that Glass is always recording.
