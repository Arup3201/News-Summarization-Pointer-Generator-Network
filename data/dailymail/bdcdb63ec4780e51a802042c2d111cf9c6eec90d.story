A man claims he was left with a 2cm gash in his face after being punched by his neighbour, a celebrity eye doctor, because grass clippings were left on his driveway.

Former model Tom Mitchell, 31 was allegedly struck in the face by Allan Ared on Saturday night and told he 'was going to die', the culmination of an 11-month feud.

Mr Mitchell and his wife Kelly were watching a movie at home in Hurstville Grove, southern Sydney, when Dr Ared and his wife Simone knocked on their door about 8.45pm.

Mr Mitchell received four stitches under his left eye on Saturday night when he was  allegedly hit by Dr Ared

'They were saying, "what the hell, you white trash, scum bags, have some common courtesy and clean up the grass clippings",' Mr Mitchell said. "You're going to get over here and clean this s*** now".'

Mr Mitchell alleges he was punched in the face by Dr Ared, who was clenching a key in his fist.

'He (Ared) was there circling back and forth - they were both up for it,' he said.

'They said their cousins wanted to pay us a visit and have it dealt with that way.'

Mr Mitchell said he was accused of deliberately leaving the clippings on the driveway, so he went and inspected them himself.

When he told them they were acting ridiculous and to 'p*** off home,' that's when he 'felt this massive smack in the face'.

'I was left with this cut a couple of centimetres long,' he said.

Daily Mail Australia has attempted to contact Dr Ared, a former radio host on 2GB and a Sydney optometrist, but he has not returned calls.

Police charged Dr Ared with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and confirmed that the Mitchells had filed an AVO application against him and his wife.

Mr Mitchell - who has modeled for clothing label Burberry - said it was not the first time that he and his wife have been confronted by Areds since moving to the area last October.

Before the couple even had time to settle in, they were in the crosshairs of their neigbours who demanded they not park on the street at the front of their home because it obscured their view.

'We told them that we weren't going to do that because we are entitled to,' Mr Mitchell said.

The pair alleged they were hosed down by Mrs Ared and had the washing on their line repeatedly soaked.
