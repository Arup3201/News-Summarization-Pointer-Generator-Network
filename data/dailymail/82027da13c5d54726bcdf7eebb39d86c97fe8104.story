A gym teacher is retiring after a 40-year career - and taking his trademark yearbook outfit with him.

Dale Irby, 63, accidentally wore the same clothes - a brown v-neck sweater and groovy white patterned shirt- for the school yearbook photo in both 1973 and 1974.

When his wife Cathy, also a teacher, dared him to wear the outfit for the third-year running at  Prestonwood Elementary in Texas, Mr Irby accepted the challenge - and ran with it.

School's out: Dale Irby, now 63, has worn the same outfit of a brown sweater and white patterned shirt in his school yearbook photo for the past 40 years

Each time his picture was taken during his 40-year career, he reached for his old favorite threads.

He told the Dallas Morning News: 'I was so embarrassed when I got the 
school pictures back that second year and realized I had worn the very 
same thing as the first year... After five pictures, it was like: ''Why 
stop?'''

He said that he wore the outfit because he had been instructed to smarten up instead of wearing his usual gym shorts for the school picture.

With each passing year, the frames change, the mustache gets a little bushier and the hair begins to grey - but the outfit stays the same.

Mr Irby added that it is the same shirt he's been using for every photograph which he can still get into - as long as he sucks his stomach in a little. 

The school principal said Mr Irby's legacy would be that he taught all his school children the value of good sportsmanship and to respect others. The school gym has been renamed in his honor.

Through the years: The frames may change and the grey hair may creep in but Mr Irby kept up his joke for years - much to the delight of his fellow teachers
