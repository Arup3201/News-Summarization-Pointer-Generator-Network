A former bartender at an Ohio country club patronized by House Speaker John Boehner has been charged with threatening to murder the 12-term congressman by poisoning his wine.

According to federal prosecutors, the failed assassination plot was hatched by 44-year-old Michael Hoyt last fall after he was fired from the Wetherington Country Club.

Investigators say Hoyt, known at the country club as ‘Bartender Mike,’ blamed Congressman Boehner for his termination in mid-October.

Bizarre plot: Former bartender Michael Hoyt (left), 44, has been charged with threatening to murder House Speaker John Boehner (right) by spiking his wine with poison 

An ax to grind: Hoyt was fired from the Wetherington Country Club in Ohio in October and apparently blamed his termination on Boehner 

When questioned by the authorities, Hoyt reportedly said evil voices coming from his car speakers and his radio at home told him the House speaker was the devil.

In his rantings to police, the 44-year-old failed mixologist also allegedly blamed the Ohio Republican for spreading Ebola and said he had been planning to shoot Boehner with his Beretta .380 automatic.

A description of Hoyt's alleged plan was laid out in an arrest affidavit filed in federal court Novwmber 6 and unsealed just over a month later.

The alleged plot on the politician’s life came to light October 29 when Mr Hoyt called 911 to complain that John Boehner allegedly got him fired a week earlier.

When officers responded to Hoyt's home on Matson Avenue in Deer Park, the bartender told them he regretted he 'did not have time to put something in John Boehner's drink' during the five years he had spent serving him wine at the country club.

According to a criminal complaint from October first obtained by WCPO, Hoyt told an officer 'he was Jesus Christ and that he was going to kill Boehner because Boehner was mean to him at the country club and because Boehner is responsible for Ebola.'

Hoyt volunteered to be taken to a psychiatric hospital, and his loaded weapon was confiscated. 

Diabolical: Hoyt reportedly said evil voices coming from his car speakers and his radio at home told him the House Speaker was the devil, while he, Hoyt, was Jesus Christ

Michael Hoyt sent a rambling email to Boehner's wife of nearly 42 years, Debbie (pictured second left), to complain about her husband

In the course of the investigation, police uncovered that Michael Hoyt sent a rambling email to Boehner's wife of nearly 42 years, Debbie, to complain about her husband a day before he called the authorities.

In his appeal to Mrs Boehner, Hoyt said he wanted her husband and another person, an Ohio doctor, to hand-deliver his termination report to him, or have him transported to a 'secure location' so the three of them could have 'an honest conversation.'

'If I had any intention of hurting Mr. Boehner, I could have poisoned his wine at Wetherington many, many times,' Hoyt reportedly wrote to Debbie Boehner.

He added a cryptic note saying they can 'work together and succeed or..... fail miserably.'

Hoyt concluded his message by providing his address and asking not to bust into the house so as not to startle his dog and cat.

Debbie Boehner emailed in response asking Hoyt what this was about, to which the man replied that he had been fired from her husband's club.

During his encounter with police the following day, the 44-year-old bartender said he started hearing voices from his radio after his termination telling him that John Boehner was the devil.

Hoys also said he was convinced that evil people were coming to 'chop him up' – a fear that prompted him to call the police.

Targeted: Hoyt's arrest comes less than a year after two other men were charged with threatening John Boehner’s life

Police said he shared his thoughts about the House speaker in an 11-page blog entry, which he emailed to his father, ex-girlfriend and a neighbor.

Officers executed a search warrant at Hoyt's apartment two days later, seizing an SKS assault rifle magazine and ammunition. They also found a notebook containing references to Boehner and Ebola.

When police went to search the home of Hoyt's mother in Hebron, Kentucky, they recovered his SKS assault rifle, which the woman said she had secretly snuck out of her son’s home on a recent visit.

While undergoing mental health evaluation, Michael Hoyt told FBI agents he was let go from his job because several members of the country club complained about his bad attitude.

It has been revealed that the 44-year-old Deer Park man has a history of mental health issues.

Two years ago, he was treated for a psychotic episode and was prescribed psychotropic medication, which he stopped taking after six months, according to the FBI.

Hoyt's arrest comes less than a year after two other men were charged with threatening John Boehner’s life.

Brandon Thompson, 32, of Indiana, was arrested May 9 for making threats against Speaker Boehner, just days before Ronald Frazier, of Arizona, tweeted about wanting to kill the Republican politician. 

A spokesman for Boehner, Michael Steel, said Tuesday the speaker is aware of the situation and sincerely thanks the FBI, the Capitol Police and the local authorities in Ohio for their efforts.

When FBI agents interviewed Boehner about Hoyt, the congressman said he knew him as a bartender at the country club in West Chester but had not had any 'negative interactions with him.'

Hoyt will remain in treatment at the Devens Federal Medical Center in Massachusetts until January 26.
