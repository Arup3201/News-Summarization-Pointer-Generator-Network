Prince Harry visited a special photo exhibition of wounded service personnel by singer Bryan Adams - where he shared a joke with some of the subjects. 

All of those pictured at the exhibition at London's Somerset House tonight had suffered life-changing injuries on military duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Harry, an army captain in the Blues and Royals,  laughed as he chatted easily with many of the wounded soldiers who took part as he was shown round the individual portraits by each subject.

Prince Harry talks to photographer Bryan Adams and servicemen at the private view of 'Wounded: The Legacy of War' at Somerset House

Harry chatted with Sergeant Rick Clement, who lost both his legs when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan

The photography exhibition by Bryan Adams of young wounded servicemen and women from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts opens to the public tomorrow

Harry joked with Sergeant Rick Clement, who lost both his legs when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan.

Sgt Clement laughed when Harry told him: 'At least your hair has grown back', with the dark humour familiar to many serving and former servicemen.

Also included in the exhibition was Private Jaco van Gass and Captain Tony Harris who were members of the British Armed Forces team in the Invictus Games.

Harry had the veterans in fits of laughter as he revealed that during his visit to Afghanistan on the weekend, some members of the RAF had collapsed.

He said: 'The visit [to Afghanistan] was great.

'Fourteen people collapsed though during the ceremony and it was only 12 degrees heat.

'But they were from the RAF so that's acceptable.'

It was the idea of ITN journalist Caroline Froggatt to approach Canadian Adams, 55, about producing portraits of those injured during the war.

She said: 'These portraits are a reminder of how savage war is but also serve as a reminded that each of us has an ongoing duty of care to our wounded veterans.'

Bryan Adams said: 'Rehabilitation doesn't end at the hospital. It's an ongoing process and I'm delighted that for some of the guys and girls in these portraits, actually sitting for them helped re-evaluate how they saw themselves.'

Father-of-three Mark Ormrod, 31, from Plymouth, struggled with self-confidence after he lost both legs and his right arm after stepping on an IED on Christmas Eve in 2007.

He said: 'I weas a big guy, 6ft2, weighing 16 stone and used to pumping a lot of iron.

'Now I'm 5ft10 and 11-and-a-half stone and the phsyical difference was very hard for me.

'It was one of the things I struggled with.

'But I was really pleased when I saw the portrait - in my head I looked a lot worse.

'I wad the first one to have my picture taken and I think Bryan was worried about offending me when he asked me to take my shorts off.

'But as a former marine I'm not scared of getting naked in public.

'I was a bit gutted though I was wearing rubbish pants.

'They were just from a M&S box set and I just wish I'd worn my Calvin Kleins!

'At least they weren't see-through.'

Proceeds from the accompanying book will go to veteran support charities BLESMA, Blind Veterans UK, Combat Stress and SSAFA, and War Child.
