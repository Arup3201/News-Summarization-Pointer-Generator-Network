Many Hollywood stars, and Newt Gingrich, are discussing how upset they are with Sony's decision to not distribute their new film The Interview following threats from hackers who have been releasing internal information and emails over the past two weeks. 

Sony Pictures Entertainment pulled the planned Christmas Day release of the picture after the hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy.

And now, many are making it public how upset they are with Sony.

Hold on now: Political loudmouth Newt Gingrch (above) is very upset Sony will not be releasing The Interview

Let it out: Gingrich took to his twitter to voice his concern about what this decision meant

'No one should kid themselves. With the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar. This is a very very dangerous precedent,' wrote Gingrich on Twitter.

He then said, 'Sony should release "the Interview" online for free so North Koreans can't censor American creativity--should have Korean language version.'

Many in Hollywood are also not happy with the decision to cancel the film, and also took to Twitter to express their frustration and anger.

'Wow. Everyone caved. The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow,' wrote Rob Lowe.

He later added; 'Saw @SethRogen at JFK. Both of us have never seen or heard of anything like this. Hollywood has done Neville Chamberlain proud today.

Gingrich actually responded to Lowe, saying, 'it wasn't the hackers who won, it was the terrorists and almost certainly the North Korean dictatorship, this was an act of war.'

Zach Braff also weighed in, writing; 'Canceling "The Interview" seems like a pretty horrible precedent to set.'

Aaron Sorkin, who was the subject of many of the emails released in the hack, also spoke about Sony's decision.

'Today the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie,' he said in a statement.

'The wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the American press who chose gossip and schadenfreude-fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public–a story that was developing right in front of their eyes. My deepest sympathies go out to Sony Pictures, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and everyone who worked on The Interview.'

Short and sweet: 'No bulls*** though, this is seriously f***ed and it's such a sad day for free speech,' said Amy Schumer (above) of Sony's decision

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, director Judd Apatow voiced his concern about where the film industry goes from here.

'What do they do when someone says the same thing about the James Bond movie or Annie?' he asked.

'There may be credible evidence of imminent violence that I don’t know about. But if they don’t really have that information, how many movies are they willing not to release?

'Our community is based on freedom of expression. Are we going to suppress ourselves every time someone posts something online? It’s a dark future.'

Steve Carrell kept it brief, saying on Twitter, 'Sad day for creative expression.'

Carrell also suffered a loss today as a film he was working on about North Korea, Pyongyang, will no longer be made.

Amy Schumer also kept it brief, and vulgar, writing; 'No bulls*it though, this is seriously fuc*ed and it's such a sad day for free speech. Frightening.'

Stephen King compared the entire thing to censorship; 'Sony's decision to pull THE INTERVIEW is unsettling in so many ways. Good thing they didn't publish THE SATANIC VERSES.'

The film may now never be released at all.

'Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film,' said a spokesperson for the studio Wednesday evening.

This despite the fact that the film cost $42million to make and tens of millions to market.

Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward.

Federal government officials have said that North Korea is behind the hack, as has been assumed for the past two weeks, though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week.

Authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside Sony helped the hackers.
