Horrified witnesses who watched as a council worker  shot dead two unsupervised horses in a park have condemned the killings as ‘wicked’.

And the owners of a nearby stables have also hit out at the ‘unnecessary’ deaths.

Police were called to Leavesden Country Park in Hertfordshire following reports of loose horses.

A local farmer said: ‘I saw it all. The police and council didn’t know what they were doing.

‘They spent two hours chasing the horses about which just made them more agitated.

‘Had they just left them to calm down they would have been fine eventually.

‘Instead they brought this man in who was following the horses around on a quad bike. He shot both animals in the head. It was wicked. He killed one on the football pitch and the other in the old cemetery.’

Mother-of-three Sally Weston, 44, who lives nearby, said she saw the horses while walking her two dogs. ‘I’m so shocked that the council ended up shooting them – there was absolutely  no need,’ she added.

Rebecca Emmett, head of regulatory services at Three Lakes District Council, said: ‘The decision to put down the horses was made reluctantly in the interests of the safety of the public. This was undertaken quickly and humanely.’

But a manager at a local riding centre, who asked not to be named, claimed he could not understand why the council did not ask for help. ‘The reason people are so angry is because they didn’t even bother to dart them,’ he said.

Lynn Palmer, who owns six horses and lives opposite the park, added: ‘This incident was totally unnecessary.’

The RSPCA said it had no  record of being contacted by the council during the incident on March 4. A spokesman for the charity World Horse Welfare added: ‘Police should try to check if a horse is microchipped and trace the owner if possible.’
