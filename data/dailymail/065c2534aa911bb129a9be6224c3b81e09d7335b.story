An astonishing 12,500 sq ft mansion sitting in three acres of rolling countryside and boasting nine large bedrooms, huge fireplaces and a luxurious swimming pool is going on sale for £5.5million.

The property in Thakeham, West Sussex, was built in 1902 by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who went on to design famous sites including New Delhi and the First World War Thiepval memorial in France.

The architect had spent 50 years working on many iconic buildings, but said this was 'the best private house of the bunch'. It was commissioned by a wine importer named Ernest Blackburn.

Legendary architect: Sir Edwin Lutyens studied at the London Royal College of Art

Sir Edwin Lutyens was born in 1869 and studied at the London Royal College of Art.

He embraced the traditional forms of his local Surrey buildings in his early days, but his style changed after meeting landscape gardener Gertrude Jekyll.

She taught him of the ‘simplicity of intention and directness of purpose’ and soon made his reputation with a house in Godalming, Surrey.

The mansion became known for balancing the roof’s sweep with high-buttressed chimneys and counteracting small doorways with long strips of windows.

Various country houses followed before he began looking at larger civil projects in 1910, and advised on the planning of New Delhi. His garden-city pattern revolved around hexagons separated by wide avenues with lines of trees.

Sir Edwin, who was knighted in 1918, later helped design a number of war memorials.
