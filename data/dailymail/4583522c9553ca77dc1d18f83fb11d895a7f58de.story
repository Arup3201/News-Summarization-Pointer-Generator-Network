A U.S. congressional panel voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for his failure to turn in sensitive Justice Department documents after a grueling six hours deliberating on Capitol Hill.

After the 23-17 party-line vote, the controversy will now be passed onto the full House of Representatives, which will vote on it next week, unless there is a resolution in the interim.

In the case, the Obama administration invoked executive privilege for the first time since coming to office, withholding some documents related to a failed gun-running investigation.

Decision made: After six hours of arguments and amendments, members on the Republican side of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee consider a vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress

The Republican-controlled House of 
Representatives' Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on a 
party-line vote, decided to cite the nation's top law enforcement 
officer in connection with the operation, code-named 'Fast and Furious.'

The move set up a new confrontation between the Democratic president and Congress.

House Speaker John Boehner and 
Majority Leader Eric Cantor said if the requested documents were 
submitted before that vote, it would provide an opportunity to resolve 
the issue.

In theory, an official charged with 
contempt could be punished with a fine or jail, but no one expects it to
come to that. Weeks or months of controversy feeding into the 
presidential election campaign is the more likely result.

Republicans were already taking 
advantage of the moment to portray the president as a participant in a 
cover-up, just as congressional Democrats did when they fought with 
President George W. Bush over that administration's refusal to turn over
documents relating to the dismissal of a group of federal prosecutors.

'Until now, everyone believed that 
the decisions regarding 'Fast and Furious were confined to the 
Department of Justice,' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker 
Boehner.

He added: 'The White House decision 
to invoke executive privilege implies that White House officials were 
either involved in the Fast and Furious operation or the cover-up that 
followed.'

Presidents since Richard Nixon have 
claimed executive privilege to protect internal documents and 
conversations in similar disputes with Congress with varying results, as
the courts have never given presidents any absolute authority to defy 
subpoenas from Congress.

Even before the vote, the White House criticized the panel chaired by conservative Representative Darrell Issa.

President Obama has granted an 11th-hour request by Attorney General Eric Holder to exert executive privilege over the Fast and the Furious documents the Department of Justice has said

'Instead of creating jobs or 
strengthening the middle-class, congressional Republicans are spending 
their time on a politically-motivated, taxpayer-funded election-year 
fishing expedition,' White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer 
told Reuters.

Rep Issa and other Republicans on the
panel accused the Justice Department that Holder heads of stonewalling 
and trying to protect its political appointees from potentially 
embarrassing revelations about the botched gun-running probe.

'The frustration of this committee in not getting documents for a year and a half must be satisfied today,' Rep Issa said.

The documents, requested by a House committee, explain how the 
Justice Department learned that there were problems with the operation that 
resulted in hundreds of guns illicitly purchased in Arizona gun shops 
winding up in Mexico.

In February 2011, when the controversy over the law enforcement operation was first disclosed, the department denied that agents had engaged in gun-walking.

'It’s a whole variety of material, and it’s consistent with what we have already made available — emails, documents of that nature — that really go into the way in which the department handled itself from February of 2011 until December of 2011,' Holder told reporters.

Ordinarily, such deliberative documents are off-limits to Congress. In Operation Fast and Furious, the Justice Department’s initial incorrect denials are seen as providing justification for Congress’ document demands.

Issa and the House Republican leadership have asked whether the department’s initial denial in a Feb. 4, 2011, letter to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, was part of a broader effort to obstruct a congressional investigation.

The material 'pretty clearly demonstrates that there was no intention to mislead, to deceive,' Holder told reporters.

'The attorney general has made an unprecedented offer to turn over documents that are part of the Department of Justice’s internal deliberations and work product and to brief the committee on their contents,' said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, one of the committee’s Democrats and a former federal prosecutor.

'Regrettably, Chairman Issa refuses to take yes for an answer.'

'We have offered to make materials available ... to brief on those documents, to answer any questions that might come up with regard to the documents that we produced,' the attorney general said.

'The ball’s in their court,' Holder said. 'We made what we thought was an extraordinary offer.'

Issa took a different view: 'After this meeting I cannot say that I am optimistic' for avoiding a contempt vote.

Issa spokesman Frederick Hill said that at the meeting, 'the attorney general indicated he would only be willing to produce a subset of documents that numbered fewer than 1,300 pages if the committee would first agree that the production of these documents would end the committee’s investigation of the Justice Department.'

Issa declined the offer.

In a letter to Issa on Tuesday night, Deputy Attorney General James Cole said 'our offer would have provided the committee with unprecedented access to these documents, many of which are not covered by the committee’s subpoenas in this matter.'

The White House move came in response to a planned vote by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for withholding the documents. The panel's chairman, Republican Darrell Issa, vowed to press on with the contempt charge.

'I write now to inform you that the president has asserted executive privilege over relevant ... documents,' Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote to the committee.

Executive privilege allows the White House to argue that some private communications between the president and members of his administration cannot be divulged to Congress.

'This untimely assertion by the Justice Department falls short of any reason to delay today's proceedings,' Issa said.

If the House panel votes to charge Holder with contempt, it would then be up to the full House to decide whether to bring that charge against the nation's top law enforcement officer.

The process could take months or even years of court battles and further poison the political atmosphere in a presidential election year.

For months, the committee and the Justice Department have been in negotiations over documents related to federal law enforcement's handling of the 'Fast and Furious' probe of guns heading from the United States into Mexico and then being used by Mexican drug cartels.

President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege for the first 
time Wednesday. He applied the presidential power to withhold documents a
House committee is seeking in an investigation of a flawed 
gun-smuggling probe called Operation Fast and Furious.

Presidents have the right to invoke executive privilege to preserve 
the confidentiality of information and documents in the face of 
legislative inquiries. The White House says presidents have asserted 
that privilege 25 times since 1980.

Here's a look at how many times each president since Ronald Reagan have asserted executive privilege:

President Barack Obama: 1

President George W. Bush: 6

President Bill Clinton: 14

President George H.W. Bush: 1

President Ronald Reagan: 3
