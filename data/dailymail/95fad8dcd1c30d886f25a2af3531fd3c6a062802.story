A suspect involved in a car chase in southwest Houston died after his car slammed into a Starbucks, creating a noise that sounded like a bomb exploded, witnesses said.

The chase occurred Tuesday morning after a plainclothes officer observed a man leaving a GameStop carrying several Xboxes and behaving suspiciously, according to police.

According to KTRK, an officer in an unmarked car followed the suspect's as uniformed cops spoke with GameStop employees, who told them they had been robbed at gunpoint.

Police radioed in for backup and a marked cruiser attempted to cut off the fleeing car, which blew a red light and clipped another vehicle.

The suspect's car then went hurtling into a Starbucks, located in an angular building at the corner of South Rice and Bissonnet in Bellaire, smashing into the facade and overturning.

An employee at the cafe described the crash as sounding like a bomb exploded, but no patrons at the store were injured.

Police approached the vehicle with guns drawn. A search of the car was conducted to see if the suspect was connected to any other robberies.
