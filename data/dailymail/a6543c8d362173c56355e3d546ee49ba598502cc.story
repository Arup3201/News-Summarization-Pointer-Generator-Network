The body of a British holidaymaker has been found floating in the sea off a paradise party island in Thailand.

Sebastian Palin, 31, was discovered by a tour boat  in the water near Coral Island, off the coast of Phuket.

The charity fundraiser was due to leave the coral atoll on the day his body was recovered.

Mr Palin, pictured, was planning to run the Plymouth half-marathon next month for two charities 

A speed boat was sent to the island at 1.30pm on February 23 and his body has been flown home for burial.

Thai police said there was no suspicion of foul play and Sebastian, known to friends as Seb, had been dead for at least 12 hours when found.

Lieutenant Wuttiwat Leangboonjinda said Mr Palin was believed to have drowned after drinking late into the night at a beach bar.

Local reports said he had got 'very drunk' at a hotel bar and staff had tried to escort him back to his room before he told them he wanted to continue drinking.

A bar worker told police: 'He drank until the bar closed and seemed stressed.'

After the bar closed no one saw Mr Palin again until they were notified of the body floating in the sea around midday the following day.

Mr Palin was born in Liverpool but grew up in Tenby, West Wales, and completed a media degree at Swansea University before settling in Plymouth with his wife of three years Victoria.

He was a committed fundraiser for the charity MIND - and had pledged to run 10 marathons this year. He said he wanted to run for the Plymouth branch of the mental health charity who helped him though 'a very troubled year'. He was also planning to raise money for St Luke's Hospice in the city who helped his father-in-law during his illness. 

His friends have paid tribute to a man who had 'the biggest heart' and always had time to help others.

Friend Ross Helmich said: 'In memory of my our best friend we have decided to carry on his legacy by running the Plymouth half marathon for him and carry on his selfless fund raising efforts. In Seb's own words, "donate or don't, but be nice, be happy and keep laughing!"'

Seb, pictured here with Kelly Jones from the Stereophonics, was going to run for Mind Plymouth who helped him through 'a very troubled year' and St Luke's Hospice who 'did so much' for his father-in-law Nic

In a tribute paid to him on his marathon fundraising page, they said: 'For any of you that had the absolute pleasure of meeting this little guy, you will know what an amazing guy he was and how he always had time to help others out, putting himself second.

'He may have been little but he had the biggest heart out there. If there was anyone in the world who deserved to live a full, happy life it was Seb!'

The page carries the last message Seb wrote on the fundraising page in which he tells friends 'life is not serious, it's not worth the worry'.

His final message reads: 'Please help raise some well deserved money to help St Luke's hospice Plymouth who did so much for Nic [his father-in-law] towards the end and also Mind Plymouth who have helped me through a very troubled year, to which I am pleased to say is now well on track to being super Seb again.

'Donate or don't but be nice, be happy and keep laughing, life is not serious, its not worth the worry. Thanks in advance.'

His sisters Olivia and Charlene are planning to run the Plymouth half marathon next month in Mr Palin's memory - for which he was due to raise money for St. Luke's Hospice and MIND.
