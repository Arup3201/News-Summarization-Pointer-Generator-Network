A crumpled set of orders for the Normandy invasion have been found under the floorboards of a New Forest hotel.

Staff were astonished to find the documents - some marked 'On His Majesty's Service' - more than 70 years after the Balmer Lawn Hotel in Hampshire was used as an army staff college.

The typed notes gave military orders and even detailed the woes of rigging up a ten-mile phone cable for advancing troops on 'D-Day 1' - June 7, 1944, the day after D-Day.

On His Majesty's Service: These crumpled D-Day orders were discovered under a hotel's floorboards

Important: The documents, which were accompanied by cigarette boxes, detailed the woes of rigging up a ten-mile phone cable for advancing troops on 'D-Day 1' - June 7, 1944, the day after D-Day

Hotel staff said 'half a bin bag' worth of typed documents and envelopes were found by workers who were refurbishing the luxury four-star hotel.

Most are thought to relate to the Canadian military, who were based at Balmer Lawn during the war.

The hotel's owner Chris Wilson said: 'We've found spent ammunition under floorboards before, but never this quantity of documents. It ties the hotel to its history.

'They are quite detailed and specific orders to be followed by troops on the ground.'

'They're in a delicate condition and unscrunching them will have to be done very carefully. After that I imagine we'll put them on display.'

The 'stash' found in the middle of a bedroom floor last week also included cigarette boxes and toothpaste tubes.

Among the paperwork were more innocuous items, including an invitation to troops to 'attend the American All variety Musical-Variety Show, Swingin' in the ETO (European Theatre of Operations)'.

Grim: Allied troops landing on the beaches

Canadian troops were instrumental to the invasion of June 6, 1944 - as their role was to take Juno Beach, one of five along a 50-mile stretch of the northern French coast.

The country sent around 14,000 soldiers, 350 of whom died on that first day, and another 450 to be parachuted in behind enemy lines.

The allied invasion, a key turning point in the Second World War, was notable for its co-operation between Britain, Canada and the U.S. Soldiers from all three countries underwent months of training. 

The documents, which were dusty, dirty and in bad shape but still readable, even survived a fire which engulfed much of the hotel in the 1970s.

'We are still in the process of evaluating the papers but some seem to include code on while others are more to do with the day-to-day organisation of the soldiers,' said a hotel spokesman.

'One includes an invite to all personnel to attend a musical variety show.

'Perhaps of most interest are the documents that refer to the D-Day landings.

'One document refers to D-Day 1 - June 7 1944 - and mentions difficulties in setting up a ten-mile telephone cable as troops continued advancing into northern France.' 

The hotel was built as a private house and hunting lodge in 1800 and extended in 1850.

During the First World War it was used as a field hospital, with injured soldiers wheeled onto the wards on luggage trolleys from Brockenhurst station a mile away.

During the 1940s it transformed into an army staff college, from which some of the orders for the D-Day landings were issued ahead of time.

Dignitaries who visited the hotel during the two wars included King George V, Winston Churchill and General Eisenhower.
