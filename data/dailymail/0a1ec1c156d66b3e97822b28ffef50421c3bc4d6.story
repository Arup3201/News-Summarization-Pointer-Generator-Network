Nicklas Bendtner may be spending the summer without a club, but he still knows he has to keep fit if he's to find a place in a Premier League squad.

The Danish striker, unable to secure a new contract at Arsenal at the end of last season, has been working out on his own and with friends, and posting the pictures on his Instagram page.

Bendtner played three-a-side cage football in America, and put a post-match picture online, as well as a video doing a ladder run behind a goal.

Boys: Bendtner posted this post-training picture to Instagram with the hashtag #withmyboys

Caged footballer: The striker played some three on three football in a cage while in America

On the run: The 26-year-old striker gets running to show off his famous quick feet

Since leaving Arsenal the 26-year-old has received interest from the likes of Eintracht Frankfurt and Aston Villa, but his high wage demands have so far proved a stumbling block. 

The videos could attract more interest. Owen Hargreaves offered potential clubs a series of videos proving his fitness in 2011, leading to being signed by Manchester City. 

However, Bendtner, who has been using his Instagram to post rather more controversial pictures over the summer, might not be so lucky unless he drops his asking price.

Give me a chance: Bendtner scored 44 times in his Arsenal career, and has had several loan spells

Alternative use: Bendtner has mostly been using his Instagram account to post more shocking pictures
