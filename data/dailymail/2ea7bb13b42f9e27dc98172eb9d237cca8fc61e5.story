A photographer has taken his art form to a new level by documenting the high jinks of performers dangling from some of the tallest rooftops in the world.

Giulio Calisse enjoys the thrill of looking over the edge, but prefers to stay back and capture the professional parkour runners doing what they do best.

The 29-year-old took this set of amazing photographs from various rooftops in downtown Toronto, some as tall as 200m (670ft).

Parkour, or freerunning as it is often known, sees performers move freely and quickly around and over obstacles in any location, often performing death-defying stunts. 

It is usually practised in cities, and can include acrobatics, leaping from and over walls, flips and precision jumping. 

While the performers are the stars of Mr Calisse's pictures, the photographer also appreciates their beautiful backdrop. 

'I like to shoot at night because there is something inherently more spectacular about the way the city looks at night, with hundreds of these tiny dots of light sprinkled across the landscape,' he said.

'You really get a sense of the scale of these huge skyscrapers, and the sheer amount of people bustling about.'

Calling his work 'urban exploration,'  Mr Calisse has also shot video of his subjects' daring exploits on the city's 'sexiest rooftopping spots'.

He has been venturing to the summits of Toronto's highest buildings for about two years, and said that it is relatively easy to make it on top of the roofs.

'There's no real training needed to reach rooftops and shoot a few photos, since most of these spots are made to be easily accessible to window cleaners and maintenance personnel.

A different view: Mr Calisse said that going to the rooftops helps him capture a look to the city that people walking on the street can't see

With the greatest of ease: Mr Callise said that the training process behind the parkour runners' effortless acrobatics was similar to what trapeze artists learn, including upper body strength conditioning

'When it comes to the hanging stunts, you could say it's a similar learning process to what trapeze artists go through.

'Overall it's important to have good upper body strength, and to practise bar work and climbing.'

Mr Calisse, originally from Rome, has been photographing the athletic parkour runners and performers for the past decade.

He said: 'I've personally had an interest in parkour and acrobatics for about 10 years, and ever since day one I've always found myself capturing images of people that were much more talented than myself.

'When we look at acrobats in their professional environment like a circus, or doing stunt work, we know to expect superhuman abilities.

'But when you replace that familiar context with a raw everyday environment like a city rooftop, the viewer can suddenly relate and almost feel the vertigo themselves.' 

Full of admiration for the daredevil athletes he documents, Mr Calisse said he doesn't partake in their riskiest behaviour.

He said, 'Although I enjoy the thrill of taking a peek from the edge, I personally avoid the more dangerous stunts and stick to walking around and taking photos.

'The people I've photographed on the edge of buildings and cranes happen to be professional parkour performers who regularly train on high ledges, swinging from bars and overall control and strength training.'

The Italian photographer was also impressed by his subjects' 'nerves of steel'.

'There wasn't really any psyching up involved in the dangles, it was a very natural process for the guys,' Mr Calisse said.

He said that the climbers have a lot of experience with urban acrobatics and added: 'The element of fear is very calculated for them.'

Above it all: Though Mr Calisse gets a thrill from peeking out over the edge of the buildings, he lets the professional parkour runners do the most dangerous stunts
