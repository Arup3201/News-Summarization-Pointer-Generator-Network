Katie Couric marked Labor Day weekend by getting engaged to her financier boyfriend of nearly two years, John Molner.

A representative for the TV host confirmed to MailOnline that Mr Molner popped the question on a beach in East Hampton, New York, as the sun went down, with a 'spectacular diamond ring'.

A widow since her husband, Jay Monahan 
died from colon cancer in 1998, mother-of-two Ms Couric, 56, has had several suitors over
the years, but never seemed to find the right match.

She told People in 2011 that she always imagined herself as a 'modern-day' version of the twice married TV character, Carol Brady.

Finally, though, she decided to stop worrying about finding a suitor.

'I used to worry a lot about the future. [But] who knows what it will bring?' she said. 'Hopefully it will bring good things.'

However, she met 50-year-old Mr Molner, a partner at the investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman, in early 2012 and soon hit it off.

They first went public with their relationship in April 2012 and Ms Couric said later that year, 'He's great. He's from Chicago. I
love Midwesterners!'

She also made it clear that she was looking to take things to the next level, telling Parade that the liked the 'idea of having a life partner.'

Before Mr Molner, Ms Couric was dating entrepreneur, Brooks Perlin, who is 17 years her junior.

They met at a charity event held to raise money for cancer research in 2006 and remained together for five years.

There was speculation at the time that her new relationship with Mr Molner came too soon after the split.

However, mutual friends of the couple reportedly said that they had been trying to set them up for years.

Mr Molner is said to have 
been a fan of Ms Couric's for some time.

Speaking to People magazine about dating, Ms Couric once said: 'I thought, it's important for me to go out. I'm always excited to meet new people and have a social life.

'I think dating is fun actually. I enjoy that part of my life.'

Mr Molner will become a step-father to Mr Couric's two daughters with Monahan, Ellie, 21, and Carrie, 17.

Making her engagement public today, Ms Couric tweeted: 'Yes it's true! So touched by all the kind
Tweets & warm wishes-thank you! A great end to the summer & 
looking fwd to seeing you all Monday!!'

Her talk show, Katie returns for a second season on September 9.
