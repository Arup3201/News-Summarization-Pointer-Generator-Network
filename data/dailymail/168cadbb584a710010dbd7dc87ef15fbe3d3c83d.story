A Conservative crime commissioner has been slammed for spending more than £7,000 on items including lip balms, magnets and sweets to promote himself.

Devon and Cornwall Commissioner Tony Hogg spent £7,617 in 16 months on products to publicise his work, figures have revealed.

Mr Hogg’s office said the items were to 'encourage participation' from members of the public.

Devon and Cornwall crime commissioner Tony Hogg has been criticised for spending more than £7,000 on promotional materials

The former Royal Navy commander spent by the cash between November 2012 and March this year. Other items bought by Mr Hogg also included pens, notepads, leaflets, and posters.

The spending emerged after a family in Barnstaple, Devon demanded to know how much he was spending after their son came back from school with some of Mr Hogg's promotional gear.

The boy’s father, Jay Duggan, said students were given a talk about Mr Hogg’s work, and items were handed out.

Mr Duggan said: 'I believe that the money would be better used by the actual police, as opposed to fuelling his vain justification of his job.'

Nigel Rabbitts, of the Police Federation in Devon and Cornwall, which represents officers up to the rank of chief inspector, said: 'How Tony Hogg spends money is an ongoing concern.

'Any increase in bureaucratic spending means less money for police officers in the community.'

During the same period, commissioner Sue Mountstevens in neighbouring Avon and Somerset spent £2,626 on promotional materials. In Dorset, Martyn Underhill spent £7,420.

Mr Hogg’s office said spending on such items was 'carefully-costed'.

It said: 'We have a responsibility to consult on a wide variety of issues with local people, and we believe that it is therefore appropriate to encourage participation by providing a range of literature about the work we do, and offer some small items that advertise our contact details.

'We are no different to many other public-facing, and funded, organisations in this regard.' 

Theresa May introduced police and crime commissioners in 2012 to give the public more say over how their local forces are run. But they have been dismissed as a waste of money and Labour has vowed to scrap them

Elected police and crime commissioners were introduced by the Government in 2012 to give the public more of a say over how their local forces are run.

Some 41 were elected with the power to hire and fire chief constables and control over a combined police budget of £8billion.

The role of the PCCs is to be the voice of the people and hold the police to account.

But they were elected on a turnout of just 15 per cent. Labour said they had a 'derisory public mandate' and were born out of a 'increasingly poisonous' relationship between Tory MPs and the police.

But Exeter Labour MP Ben Bradshaw said: 'Labour opposed police and crime commissioners as a wasteful distraction at a time when the police were having to impose deep cuts on the service.

'Their performance has not generally impressed and I'm pleased Labour is committed to replacing them with a cheaper and more representative system of police accountability through police boards to release much needed money for front line policing.'

Mr Hogg was elected in November 2012 in a ballot which saw just fifteen per cent of people across the two counties turn out to vote.

He has previously been criticised for having more staff and spending more money than the former police authority. 

Mr Hogg has 20 people working for him, while the previous authority had 17.

The Tory crime commissioner, who picked up a salary of £85,000, is a retired sailor who spent more than 30 years in the Royal Navy.

He served in the Falklands War and in the Gulf and was commanding officer of RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall, reaching the rank of commodore.
