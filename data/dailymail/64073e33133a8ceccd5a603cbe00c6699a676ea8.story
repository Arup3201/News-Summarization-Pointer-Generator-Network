The number of illegal migrants arrested as they try to get to Britain from Calais has doubled to more than 7,000 in six months – and many are being released immediately, new figures revealed yesterday.

Despite tougher security measures introduced by the French, there has been a huge increase in those trying to make their way through the Channel Port to the UK.

Figures compiled by the local prefecture show 7,414 were arrested between January and June this year.

This compares to 3,129 for the same period in 2013.

Most said they wanted to claim asylum in Britain – a procedure which would allow them to claim social security and other benefits.

A source at the Calais port told AFP, France’s national news agency: ‘We have noted that there are considerably more illegal migrants, and during our checks we find more’.

Some 1,200 were arrested in the first two weeks of this month alone, and most were released straight away because of overcrowding in detention centres, said the source.

This allows them to return to Calais, or other French ports, where they play a cat-and-mouse game with the police as they try and get aboard lorries and ferries.

Last week the mayor of Calais passed an official decree banning the setting up of camps in areas, saying they were a danger to public health.

A number of illegal camps have been bulldozed, with the authorities doing everything possible to get the migrants to leave the town.

But this has not stopped hundreds from African countries like Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea arriving, along with others from war torn nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain’s ‘generous welfare system’ is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town.

Her deputy, Philippe Mignonet, who is also the port’s immigration chief, said in December that Britain needed to do more to address the numbers of migrants crossing its borders because it had become ‘a magnet for illegal immigrants’.

Mr Mignonet claimed that the migrants refused all help on offer Calais in the hope of making it across the border.

He explained: ‘They only want to go to England, as simple as that. They refuse everything, all the facilities that can be offered, they are refusing because they want to go to England’ The town hall official also accused Britain of not helping their French neighbours combat the problem: ‘They’ve got no role, they don’t do anything.’.
