Guilty: Lisa Foster, 31, was handed a two-year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to stealing almost £8,000 from 81-year-old Frank Kilfoyle who she cared for

A blind pensioner was left starving when a 'family friend' stole money from his bank account to purchase hundreds of DVDs and downloads from iTunes.

Frank Kilfoyle, 81, had entrusted Lisa Foster, 31, with his bank details so that she could buy food for him and retrieve cash.

But the pensioner was forced to appeal to social workers when his unofficial carer failed to buy him any groceries, keeping most of the money for herself.

Bolton Crown Court heard that Foster stole almost £8,000 from Mr Kilfoyle, who had known her since she was a child

Handed a two-year suspended sentence, Foster was told that she escaped jail by the 'skin of her teeth'.

Mr Kilfoyle, whose eyes were damaged at birth, suffered from mobility problems and died in January last year, two months after Foster was arrested.

His sister Mary Mariner said that the pensioner weighed less than seven stone when he died.

Speaking after the hearing, she said: 'God love him, he never got out of bed again. He was skin and bone. He couldn't keep his false teeth in because he had lost so much weight.'

After initially visiting his home to carry out repair work as a child, Mr Kilfoyle eventually gave Foster his bank card and pin number and 
asked her to withdraw £100 a month for him and to do food shopping.

But between January 2010 and November 2011, Foster kept approximately two thirds of what 
was withdrawn for herself, shoving only small amounts of cash through his 
letter box. It is estimated she took 
£7,984.73.

In the weeks before she was caught, she
kept all the money for herself, leaving Mr Kilfoyle with no food at his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester. In desperation, he asked for help from the authorities.

Prosecutor Neil Fryman told the court that Mr Kilfoyle was in a 'rather sorry state' and was in arrears with electricity, water and other bill.

When police were called and visited 
Foster they found she had amassed a collection of 700 DVDs and CDs and discovered receipts for a television and jewellery.

The court also heard that she had purchased goods from iTunes and HMV online.

Abuse of trust: Judge Bernadette Baxter told Foster during the hearing at Bolton Crown Court (pictured): 'Unfortunately you abused the trust he placed in you and abused it grievously'

Foster told officers that Mr Kilfoyle liked to buy her presents and claimed he had a crush on her.

The court heard that in June 2010 Mr 
Kilfoyle had complained to police about Foster stealing from him but 
later withdrew the allegation.

'I thought the world of her. I personally forgave her,' he later told officers.

Andrew Costello, defending, said Foster had had problems in her childhood and learning difficulties.

He said that at the time of the 
offences she was out of work, depressed and had been abusing alcohol.

Judge Bernadette Baxter told Foster that Mr Kilfoyle must have initially welcomed her acting as an unofficial carer.

She said: 'Unfortunately you abused the trust he placed in you and abused it grievously.

'You did it to buy luxuries for 
yourself and your family - that, at a time when Mr Kilfoyle didn't even 
have a penny to pay his bills, to buy food and keep a roof over his 
head.'

Foster was sentenced to 12 months 
in prison, suspended for two years, and will have to wear an electronic 
tag.

She was also ordered to do 100 hours unpaid work.
