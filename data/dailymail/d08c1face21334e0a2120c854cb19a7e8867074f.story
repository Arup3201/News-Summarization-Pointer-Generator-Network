Two wealthy couples have spent £500,000 on a venomous legal battle over ‘a few feet’ of muddy ditch between their homes, shocked Appeal Court judges heard yesterday.

The couples have lavished six- figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in Cheshire.

Businessman Richard Gilks and his wife Heidi insist they have a right to drive over the ditch and down the track next to their five-acre property in Mobberley, as a shortcut to Wilmslow – home to Sir Alex Ferguson and a host of other celebrities.

Land battle: Neighbours have spent £500,000 in a dispute over a 'few feet' of ditch. The Gilks from Fiveacres (right) wants to drive over it along a track, in red, but the Hodgsons, from White Peak Farm (left), say they are 'breaking the law'

Their neighbours, Adrian Hodgson, 75, and his wife Joanne, 63 – who breed alpacas and wallabies – say the Gilkses are breaking the law and that their animals are disturbed by traffic passing along the track. 

The Hodgsons are asking London’s Appeal Court to rule that the Gilkses do not own the whole ditch, and have no legal right to drive over it.

Lord Justice Bean said: ‘This case is about a patch of land a few feet either way. What are the costs in the case so far? Half a million? I imagine that the disputed right of way is worth rather less.’

The area surrounding Mobberley and Wilmslow is home to footballing royalty, including Wayne Rooney, Louis van Gaal and Joe Hart. 

Unhappy: Richard Gilks won a ruling in their favour last year but his rival Adrian Hodgson, right, says their cars disturb the animals they breed on their land 

Lord Justice Bean, Lord Justice Christopher Clarke and Sir Stanley Burnton heard that the Gilkses’ property and the Hodgsons’ home were originally part of one parcel of land, which was divided and sold off in 1950.

The Hodgsons’ land has been in their family for years, while the Gilkses moved in in 2004, said Caroline Hutton, for Mr and Mrs Hodgson.

After getting on initially, the couples fell out over a planning dispute and then went to war over the ditch and the track.

Wrangle: The Gilks use this track as a way to get to nearby Wilmslow, which makes their neighbours furious

Miss Hutton said the Hodgsons saw red when Mr and Mrs Gilks began using the bridle path – beside which they grazed their alpacas – as a means of cutting a few minutes off their drive into Wilmslow.

Years of bitter feuding in and outside court ensued, with the Gilkses insisting they were exercising a legitimate right of way and the Hodgsons claiming their neighbours were breaking the law.

The Gilkses scored a victory at Manchester County Court in December last year, when the judge ruled that they own the whole ditch and that their boundary lies in the middle of the track, giving them the right to drive over the ditch.

But the Hodgsons are challenging that decision, saying their neighbours’ boundary reaches only halfway across the ditch, and they are legally blocked from crossing the other half in a vehicle. 

Miss Hutton told the judges yesterday that land registry plans prove the border of the Gilkses’ home extends no further than the centre of the ditch.

Bitter: Heidi Gilks, left, and her husband Richard are battling neighbours Joanne Hodgson, right, and her husband Adrian over the right of way row

Ian Foster, for Mrs and Mrs Gilks, said that even if the couple did not own the whole ditch, they had established a legitimate vehicular right of way through long usage.

‘Mr and Mrs Gilks have always maintained that a right of way through the gate and over and along the track was necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of [their home] because of the size of the property and its particular geographic location,’ he added. 

Lord Justice Clarke, expressing bafflement over the protracted war over a ditch, asked the lawyers: ‘What is so special about it?’

Mr Foster said: ‘Using the way for the purpose of travelling to and from the closest town of Wilmslow gave rise to a significantly shorter journey than would have been the case had that same journey been made using the public highway.’

The judges have reserved their decision until a later date.
