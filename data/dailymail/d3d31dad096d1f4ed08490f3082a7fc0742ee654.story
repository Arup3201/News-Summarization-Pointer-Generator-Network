Picking unique baby names has never been easy - but it's even harder in the internet age for parents who want their kids to have their own domain names. 

For the 21st century problem, comes a 21st century solution - AwsomeBabyName.com. 

Plug in a last name, the baby's sex - or simply 'whatever' - and it generates a list of 'awesome' baby names that have available .com domains. 

The site even offers a handy link to purchase the domains. 

Twenty-first century problem: Most common domain names are already taken. And even many obscure ones have already been used

But parents with common last names should be prepared for some uncommon suggestions. 

Mr and Mrs Smith are expecting? Try Ximena, Naveah or Callen.

If Mr and Mrs Johnson want their newborn to have his own domain name, they might be stuck with DaxtonJohnson.com. Or ZaidenJohnson.com.

All the common domain names have long been spoken for. JohnSmith.com, currently owned by company in Hong Kong, has been occupied since 1997. JenniferJohnson.com has been taken since 1999 and is currently hosting a half-finished web page for a model. MichaelWilliams.com, unavailable since 1998, is the personal web page for a film production manager.

So far, more than 210,000 people have used AwesomeBabyName.com - though it's not clear whether any of the searches have resulted in wacky baby names yet.

The site was created by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Finbarr Taylor (FinbarrTaylor.com) and Karen X Cheng (KarenX.com - KarenCheng.com has been taken since 2007.)

The pair operate Give100.com - a site the encourages people to undertake one task, do it every day or 100 days, and film their progress. They're also working on a video-sharing app called Waffle (website: MadeWithWaffle.com - Waffle.com was snatched up in 1996).

Creative names: Parents with a common last name like Smith are in for a challenge if they want to give their baby a name with an available domain
