Wandering around National Trust properties, with their tree-lined drives, gilded drawing rooms and 20ft dining tables dressed with Sèvres porcelain, you may dream of living in one yourself. Well, what’s stopping you?

The National Trust lets about 5,000 properties. Initially, the lease is for six months, but they can be extended to ten or 20 years. Competition to secure one is fierce, especially for custodian tenancies. 

These are for houses that are of historic or architectural interest, and in return for opening the house on certain days, the charity reduces the tenant’s rent.

Custodians : David Scott with dog Annie at The Homewood which was designed by Patrick Gwynne in 1938

Accountant David Scott and his publisher partner Louise Cavanagh have lived at The Homewood, a modernist house near Esher, Surrey, with their daughter Isabella and border collie Annie since 2007.

The 1938 house was designed by architect Patrick Gwynne. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gwynne designed houses throughout the South, and was also responsible for such diverse buildings as the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen in London’s Hyde Park and Burtonwood service station on the M62 in Cheshire.

‘There were 60 applicants at the start,’ says David. ‘But a lot fell away when they realised the scale of responsibilities.’

After seven rounds of interviews, his family was deemed suitable to be responsible for accommodating 2,500 visitors a year to the house.

‘We have a 30-strong army of fantastic volunteers to steward the house and help with the garden, but we have to interview, select and train them. 

'We’re open from April to October and hold a pre-season party for them every year.

‘We have to pay for a cleaner, a gardener and all the gardening equipment. The winter power bills are £35 a day – the house has 5,000 sq ft of single glazing – and we pay two lots of council tax since there’s also an unstaffed staff flat on the site.’

David and Louise both work from home: ‘It would be impossible if we didn’t,’ explains David. ‘I need to be on site nine days out of ten when we’re open, here for when the Trust sends workmen or restorers, and present for all the power, alarm and tree inspections.’

The six-acre garden and five rooms are open to the public. ‘It’s tough if you’re ill. You have to cross from the bedroom to the kitchen through a public area,’ laughs David.

Custodian tenanted properties are furnished. The Homewood has important pieces such as a Patrick Gwynne sofa, an Eames recliner, and metal chairs by William Plunkett, who designed furniture for the QE2.

Not all lettings require tenants to open properties to the public. There are also standard tenancies, and there are about 40 properties to rent in this category, ranging from tiny cottages in national parks that will set you back less than the rent on a London flat, to Bellister Castle in Northumberland.

Some properties come with a whiff of scandal attached. In 2009, MI5 whistleblower David Shayler and other squatters were evicted from the 16th Century Hackhurst Farm in Surrey, which can now be rented for £2,500 a month.

‘It’s set in wonderful open countryside,’ says Andrea Jones, Hackhurst’s departing tenant. ‘Over the fence I can see Belted Galloway cattle on one side and sheep and pasture land on the other. The Trust is a great landlord. I was proud to be a tenant.’
