A controversial Queensland cartoonist claims he is under police protection after publishing a cartoon featuring the Prophet Muhammad. 

In a post on his Facebook page, Larry Pickering said he was visited by law enforcement officers at his home on Sunday night.

'I must be getting up someone’s nose because two gentleman from the Counter Terrorism Unit came to my door in the pouring rain last night to tell me I was under protective surveillance due to some chatter or other,' he said.

The provocative artist posted the picture in the immediate aftermath of the Paris massacre where 12 people were killed by gunmen at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. 

In an interview with the Herald Sun newspaper, Pickering said: 'They gave me their details and special phone numbers and said if I call they will be there in minutes.  

Pickering was responsible for an online campaign against former Prime Minister Julia Gillard several years ago, which involved several derogatory cartoons. 

A police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia: 'For operational, security and privacy reasons, the QPS would not comment on such matters regardless of the individual.' 

Pickering told the Herald Sun he 'won't be cowed by acts of barbarism'.
