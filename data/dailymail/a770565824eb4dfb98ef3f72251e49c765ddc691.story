A Sydney Airport maintenance worker has been charged with importing nearly 100 kilograms of cocaine into Australia, worth nearly $19 million.

In April, Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) Officers intercepted nearly 75kg of cocaine hidden in the baggage at Sydney International Airport.

Australian Federal Police say the 38-year-old worker, from Bradbury in Sydney's southwest, was allegedly waiting in the designated baggage terminal for the arrival of the two kite board bags.

After further investigations the man was identified as allegedly removing a similar package, believed to contain 24kg of cocaine, from a golf bag in February.

It's estimated the drugs had a street value of nearly $19 million, the AFP said.

AFP Sydney Airport Police Commander Wayne Buchhorn said 'the arrest and the amount of cocaine seized demonstrate the ongoing commitment the AFP and its partner agencies have to keeping these drugs off Australian streets'.

ACBPS Regional Commander NSW, Tim Fitzgerald, said customs and border protection officers are 'dedicated to protecting the Australian community from all threats, including those from people in positions of trust'.

'The arrest of this man should act as a warning to anyone considering abusing a privileged position at an Australian airport,' he said.

The Sydney Airport worker faced court on Tuesday with charges of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug.

The AFP has not ruled out further arrests.

It's estimated the drugs had a street value of nearly $19 million, the AFP said
