The family of a two-year-old girl who was killed when a stone fireplace fell on her at her home have today paid tribute to their 'little princess'.

Trinity Liliana Coward was found with serious injuries at her house in Lakenham, Norwich, at about 5pm on Sunday.

She was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital but died shortly after arrival.

Parents Kelly, 31, and dad Shaun, 35, today paid tribute to their child.

Trinity Liliana Coward, 2, (pictured) died when a stone fireplace fell on her at home, police said today. She was taken to Norfolk and Norwich hospital with serious injuries and died a short while later

They said: 'Our little princess. Your gorgeous smile and those dimples forever etched on our hearts.

'Daddy's
 little baby girl shine bright like a diamond in the sky. Mummy's little
 angel so loving and cuddly. Can't wait to have snuggles xxx.

'Till we see you again all our love from Mummy, Daddy and your brothers and sisters xx'

Neighbours today said the family moved into the council house about two years ago.

Colleen Seeley, 71, said she heard a 'huge crash' and 'screaming' before emergency services rushed to save the little girl.

She said: 'I came home on Sunday at 4.15 and at 4.45 I heard this crash like scaffolding falling down, it was very loud. I heard the girl's mother scream, she really screamed.

'Outside the dad was on his phone, calling the ambulance and he left the others inside.

'Other neighbours must have heard it along the road. A man said his son had heard it as he got in the van to go to work. A lot of neighbours were running across to help.

'Paramedics came and she was put in the ambulance before they brought her out again to do some sort of procedure behind screens.

'They were doing CPR on her and then then they rushed off with her to hospital. I know the little girl has brothers who are 16 and four and a sister who is 10.

'She is a really nice little girl, really pretty, it's very sad.

'I'm not sure how it could have happened. I know the man who used to live in the house didn't have a fireplace so it must be quite new. They moved in around two years ago.'

A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she heard a loud 'crash' before a woman started screaming.

She said: 'The paramedics were dealing with her on the side of the road. They did CPR on her in the street.

'They put the little girl in the ambulance. She was in there a little while.

'After a while they got her out of the ambulance again and the paramedic did something with her throat.

'They were holding a sheet up so people couldn't see. They then went off and had a police car in front and a police car behind.'

Her death, which is not being treated as suspicious, comes just days after a tradesman was jailed for eight months after a fireplace he fitted fell and killed a six-year-old girl.

Isabella Pritchard - known as Bella - suffered massive head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace installed by Christopher Elmer, 39, of Greenford, west London, crashed on top of her.

The girl, who attended £10,000-a-year Maltman’s Green School in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, was taken to hospital where she died from her catastrophic injuries.

James Curtis, three, of Birkenhead, Merseyside was also killed by a falling fireplace at his home in April last year.

Matthew Green, four, died in 2005 when a 50kgs mantelpiece collapsed on him at his family's new home in Towcester, Northamptonshire in October 2005.

Stonemason Kristian Childs, 42, was fined £7,500 at Northampton Crown Court last June after he admitted health and safety offences in connection with Matthew's death

Speaking today of Trinity's death, Local councillor Keith Driver said: 'It's a very sad time for the family and just tragic that these events happen.

'There's nothing you can really say to make anything any better.

'I think people around the area will 
know the child as well so it will mean the whole area is sad as well. 
Whenever a child dies it's a tragic event.'

Bert
 Bremner, Norwich City Council cabinet member for housing, said: 'This 
is an awful tragedy and our thoughts are with the family at this 
difficult time.

'Our staff are here to support them in any way we can.'

Norfolk Police said: 'The circumstances surrounding the infant's death will be subject to a coroner's enquiry although early indications are that this was an unforeseen and tragic event in a family home.'

An East of England Ambulance Service Trust spokesman said: 'We were called at 4.44pm to treat an injured toddler.

'An ambulance, paramedic officer and the East Anglian Air Ambulance were dispatched.

'The casualty, a two-year-old girl suffered serious injuries and was conveyed by land to Norfolk & Norwich Hospital.'

The East Anglian Air Ambulance also attended the incident, arriving at 5.09pm.
