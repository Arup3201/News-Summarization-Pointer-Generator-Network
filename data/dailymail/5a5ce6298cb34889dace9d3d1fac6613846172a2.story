On Sept. 7, 1964, what is arguably the most famous political commercial of all time aired for the first, and last, time, featuring a young, carefree girl picking the petals off of a flower seconds before an atomic bomb detonates.

50 years later, the Daisy ad still resonates, created for the campaign of President Lyndon Johnson and implying that the country might be on the brink of a nuclear war should his opponent, Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, win the election.

Now, the girl who starred in the famous spot, a grown up Monique Luiz, is recalling the impact the commercial had on her life, and revealing that she and her family had no idea what they were even filming at the time.

Innocence lost: The Daisy ad warned of the possibility of nuclear war by showing a carefree child seconds before a bomb exploded

Today: Now 53, the star of the commercial, Monique Luiz, lives in Arizona

'I did what my parents told me to do,' Luiz said in a recent interview with The Arizona Republic.

'And actually my parents didn't even know what [the commercial] was about. They didn't even know it was a political commercial. I already knew how to count, I think to 50, and my mom was told to teach me to count backwards. And I struggled with that.'

The ad shows the then 3-year-old counting backwards, but when she reaches 10, a chilling voice-over countdown begins, ending with a nuclear bomb detonating with a giant mushroom cloud when the countdown gets to zero.

'These are the stakes,' says President  Johnson in voice-over.

'To make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die.'

The ad, which many consider the first political attack ad, never actually mentions Sen. Goldwater.

Too far: Many thought that the detonation of a nuclear bomb, complete with mushroom cloud, at the end od the television commercial went to far

In the dark:  Luiz says she and her family did not even know they were filming a political ad, let alone something that would become so notorious and controversial

Though it aired only once as a paid spot, it was so polarizing that every news program replayed it for days following its premiere. 

In addition to members of the public criticizing President Johnson and members of his campaign for creating the commercial, as well as ad agency Doyle Dane Bernbach, people were also outraged any parent would let their child be featured in something so morbid and violent.

'My grandmother was super-nervous about the fact that there were so many people bad-mouthing my parents and me,' Luiz said.

'She was really worried because people were saying, 'How could any parents let their children be in a commercial like that? How could you let your child blow up?' ... So that's kind of how I grew up.' 

Then a little girl from New Jersey,  Luiz actually moved to Arizona in 1983, the same state as Goldwater.

She kept quiet about her star turn for most of her life, but in 2011 attended an event in Louisiana for the book Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds, an examination of the ad by Robert Mann, and its impact on how political campaigns have come to be run.

'It was really strange for me,' said Luiz. 

'They had me sign the books "Monique Cozy, the Daisy Girl." So I felt really famous for that weekend.'

50 years later, people are still talking about it.
