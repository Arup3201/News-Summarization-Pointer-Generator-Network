After Sony yanked North Korean satire 'The Interview' from theaters, several small houses announced plans to show 'Team America' - another film featuring a North Korean leader - in an attempt to spite the hermit regime. 

However, Paramount Pictures has now put the kibosh on the screenings - sending out messages barring the cinemas from showing the movie. 

One of the theaters, the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema said; 'Due to to circumstances beyond our control, the TEAM AMERICA 12/27 screening has been cancelled. We apologize & will provide refunds today.'

Paramount however has yet to make any comment on their decision to not allow cinemas to show the film.

'Team America: World Police' features the previous leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-il as a singing marionette that gets impaled on a spike and is later revealed to be a space alien

North Korea called 'The Interview' and 'act of war' for portraying the assassination and violent death of its current leader, Kim Jong-un - who took over after his father's death 

While 'The Interview' shows currently leader Kim Jong-un being assassinated in a gory fashion, 'Team America: World Police' depicts a marionette version of his father, Kim Jong-il. 

In 2004's 'Team America,' Kim Jong-il is impaled on a spike and then revealed to be an alien. 

Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Richardson, Texas, on Thursday advertised the December 27 showing of 'Team America' as a show of support for freedom. 

Earlier today, the Drafthouse and three other theaters that announced plans to show 'Team America' posted on Twitter to say that the screening was canceled. 

Two other theaters posted that they were pulling 'Team America' on the orders of Paramount. 

Paramount has not commented on the move.
