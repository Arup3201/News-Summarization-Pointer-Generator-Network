Menopausal symptoms could be an early warning sign of women whose bones will deteriorate more quickly, it is claimed

Women who suffer hot flushes and night sweats during the menopause are more likely to break a hip than women who don’t, warn researchers.

Menopausal symptoms could be an early warning sign of women whose bones will deteriorate more quickly, it is claimed.

A US study using data from almost 24,000 older women looked at hip fracture rates up to eight years later.

More than two thirds of women going through the change suffer hot flushes – known as hot flashes in the US – and they can last for several years.

Dr Carolyn Crandall, of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said ‘Our findings suggest women who exhibit moderate or severe menopausal symptoms are more likely to have issues with bone health than their peers.

‘This is the first large cohort study to examine the relationship between menopausal symptoms and bone health in menopausal women.’

The prospective study examined data from 23,573 participants in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trial, who were aged between 50 and 79.

The study tracked women’s annual visits to clinical centres for 8 years, on average.

Women were asked about their menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats, during the initial visit.

They were then were monitored for fractures during the follow-up period.

Almost 5,000 also had their bone mineral density measured to gauge bone strength, says a report published in the Endocrine Society’s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (must credit).

Women who reported having moderate or severe hot flushes when they entered the study were more likely to fracture a hip during the follow-up period than women who had no menopausal symptoms.

After researchers adjusted for age and other factors, they found women with moderate to severe symptoms had lower bone mass density at the neck and spine during the follow-up period than women with no symptoms.

The menopause speeds the body’s normal process of bone loss, but the findings suggest it may be even faster in women with symptoms.

Dr Crandall said ‘More research is needed to illuminate the connection between bone health and menopausal symptoms.

‘Improved understanding would help clinicians advise women on how to better prevent osteoporosis and other bone conditions.’

But UK experts say hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms.

A new review out today (fri) says hot flushes and night sweats affect around 70 per cent of women for an average of 5 years but may continue for many years in about 10 per cent of women.

In the UK an estimated one million women are prescribed HRT in their 50s to replace natural supplies of oestrogen that diminish during the menopause causing symptoms such as hot flushes.

HRT is known to slow bone loss and increase bone density.

Controversy over HRT being linked to breast cancer, heart disease and stroke led to a dramatic fall in users.

But a reappraisal of HRT carried out by experts found the extra health risks mostly applied to older patients in their 60s and 70s, who do not normally use HRT but were given it for research purposes.

Younger women can benefit from HRT at the onset of the menopause, says the new review published in The Obstetrician & Gynaecologist journal (must credit).

Doctors should not be concerned about discussing the risks and benefits of HRT with women who have menopausal symptoms, or hesitate to offer a trial of appropriate treatment, it says.

Shagaf Bakour, Honorary Senior Lecturer and Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at City Hospital, Birmingham, and co-author of the review said ‘Women are sometimes concerned about the increased risk of breast cancer related to HRT.

‘However, this risk is much lower than that associated with other factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption and later maternal age.

‘HRT is the most effective treatment for symptoms of the menopause and when HRT is individually tailored, women gain maximum advantages and the risks are minimised.

‘There are various types and regimens of HRT and healthcare professionals will be able to advise on the suitability of HRT to any woman.’

Women with severe symptoms were 78 per cent more at risk of hip fracture than those without.
