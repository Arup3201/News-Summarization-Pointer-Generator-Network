Joel Campbell produced a performance to catch the eye of Arsene Wenger as Arsenal’s Under 21 team thrashed West Brom at the Emirates.

The Costa Rica World Cup star is trying to stake his claim as the man to lead Arsenal’s line in the absence of the injured Olivier Giroud and he did himself no harm here with an energetic performance full of flair and creativity.

The only thing missing for Campbell was a goal but that didn’t matter as a stunning Daniel Crowley free-kick and a hat-trick from the outstanding Chuba Akpom gave the Gunners the Under 21 Premier League points.

On the day Wenger confirmed that Giroud will be out until the New Year with a serious ankle injury sustained in Saturday’s draw at Everton, Campbell was given a chance to get a full 90 minutes under his belt before possibly being pressed into first-team action.

It must have been a little surreal for the 22-year-old playing in front of an audience of just 1,500 at the Emirates two months after he dazzled out in Brazil.

But he showed his maturity in an encouraging display and looked threatening every time he touched the ball. 

He couldn’t resist the odd flick or step-over but the real highlight came when he slipped in Akpom for his hat-trick goal with a lovely chipped through ball. 

It is a dead cert Wenger will start with £30million summer signing Alexis Sanchez up front against Leicester City on Sunday but the boss will be pleased Campbell is in good touch and ready to step in, especially with Lukas Podolski tipped to leave the club and Yaya Sanogo still unconvincing. 

Full-back: Hector Bellerin has his work cut out if he is to get ahead of Mathieu Debuchy into the first team

Indeed, on this form, it might be worth throwing Akpom into that mix too. The 18-year-old has been impressive on a regular basis at this level for the past 18 months.

Arsenal find themselves in the second division of the reformatted Under 21 league but they showed plenty of class against a poor Baggies side.

Abou Diaby also made an appearance for 45 minutes in midfield as he continues his latest recovery from injury and there was a game too for forgotten man Francois Coquelin.

It didn’t take long for the hosts to establish a lead and it came from a majestic swing of Crowley’s boot. Everyone expected him to send the free-kick, wide on the left, into the middle but he went for goal and deceived goalkeeper Jack Rose with his impudence.

Chance: Joel Campbell will want to prove himself while Olivier Giroud is out injured

8min His first meaningful involvement - collects the ball in the middle, spreads it wide to Daniel Crowley and gets it back. Tries to lift the ball over the goalkeeper but it floats wide of the far post

11 Sharp shimmy to the right to receive a ball from Hector Bellerin and then play the right-back in - leads to a corner

16 Calling out for the ball as he darts into the box but Crowley ignores his run and shoots instead

21 Good chest control on the edge of the box and a left-footed shot that is dragged wide of the mark

39 Gets into a good forward position down the left-channel to roll a low ball in towards Akpom. Cleared for a corner

40 Bends a shot wide of the target after cutting in from the right-hand side

44 Burst down the right, step-over and then cuts back to play 60-yard ball to other side

54 Sparking run of step-overs to get past three West Brom defenders before a tame side-footed shot that rolled wide

58 Instigated a move deep in midfield, drives through the middle and then plays the ball out wide with the outside of the boot. Leads to a chance for Crowley, which is saved

69 Played an excellent chipped ball to set Chuba Akpom free inside the box, allowing the livewire striker to complete his hat-trick 

Campbell’s first real involvement came on eight minutes when, after trading passes with Crowley, he lifted a shot that beat Rose but landed wide of the far post.

Crowley looked excellent and a swirling cross-cum-shot nearly caused more embarrassment for Rose, before Diaby’s hit from 20 yards took an awkward deflection and bounced just over.

Akpom found some space inside the box and fired off a shot that Rose clawed away, while Campbell dragged a left-footed shot wide following a nice piece of chest control.

A second Arsenal goal seemed inevitable and it arrived on the half-hour. Crowley’s corner caused all kinds of carnage and after Semi Ajayi’s shot had been repelled, the ball was work across for Akpom to steer home.

Gunners captain Isaac Hayden tested Rose early in the second half and the goalkeeper also used his legs to block a powerful Crowley strike.

But there was nothing the Baggies defence could do about Akpom as he lost his marker to score the third with a towering header from Hector Bellerin’s inviting cross.

Still they weren’t satisfied and Campbell’s lofted through pass for Akpom to complete his treble with a composed low finish was the highlight of the evening.

West Brom did manage to pull one back when Kyle Howkins sent a free header past Deyan Iliev from a Rees Wedderburn cross and they gained another in stoppage time when Kemar Roofe lifted a shot high into the corner.

But it was Arsenal’s night and for Wenger, there were plenty of reasons for encouragement.
