More than 100 NHS hospitals in Britain contain fast food outlets, shocking new figures have revealed. 

Critics argue the presence of Burger King, Costa Coffee and Greggs around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis. 

There are 128 outlets in British hospitals selling junk food, plus a further 32 branches of WHSmith, which sells confectionery - often at a discounted price.

There are also dozens of coffee shops - with 27 Starbucks and 92 Costas (such as this one at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford) - selling calorie-laden treats

The fast food branches include two Burger Kings, six Subways and one Greggs, an investigation by The Sun revealed.

There are also dozens of coffee shops selling calorie-laden food and drink - with 27 Starbucks and 92 Costas.

This is in addition to all the smaller, independent retailers in hospitals selling junk food.  

The news comes as figures from Public Health England show that in Britain, 64 per cent of adults are either overweight or obese.   

And experts estimate treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the NHS around £6 billion every year - or five per cent of the entire NHS budget. It spends a further £10billion on diabetes.

To make matters worse, some of the UK's major hospitals have more than one outlet selling junk food. 

Addenbrooke's in Cambridge operates a food court with a Burger King, Costa Coffee, Starbucks and pizzeria, while and University Hospital Southampton Foundation trust also hosts a Burger King and a Costa Coffee shop.

Earlier this month, it emerged the Greggs bakery at the New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, is the fast-food chain's second busiest outlet in Britain

Earlier this month it was reported that the Greggs bakery based in an NHS hospital is the fast-food chain's second busiest outlet in Britain.

The counter at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton is often so busy selling steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas that ropes have to be used to separate queues of hungry customers which can reach 20 people deep. 

The Sun investigation found customers could buy four sausage rolls for £2.40, each which contained 25g fat. The total recommended daily amount of fat is 75g for women and 90g for men.

Those with a sweet tooth could buy three sugar and fat laiden doughnuts for £1. 

However a spokesman denied the hospital branch was the chain's second biggest outlet. 

She said: 'There has been a Greggs shop at New Cross Hospital for over 10 years. 

'While popular with customers and providing a wide variety of products, this shop is not Greggs’ second busiest shop.'

Critics argue the presence of Burger King (pictured in Addenbrooke's hospital), Costa Coffee and Greggs around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis

But David Loughton, chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals, said he had heard on good authority that the bakery at the hospital was the chain's second busiest.

He said: 'There is a cafe in site that sells all healthy food but it gets nowhere near the footfall that Greggs gets.

'You can understand the appeal. It is relatively cheap.'

Earlier this week, MPs called for a ban on fast-food outlets such as McDonald’s and Burger King from hospitals.

The move is part of several measures to tackle the growing number of Britons who are becoming dangerously overweight.

As fast-food concessions come up for renewal, hospitals should demand healthier, tastier, affordable alternatives, experts say

The report on the impact of physical activity and diet on health endorses the views of Professor Theresa Marteau, an expert in public health at Cambridge University.

She states that hospitals are being negligent by allowing such firms to operate in places that promote good health.

In her evidence to MPs, she said: 'It is at best anomalous- and at worst negligent - that NHS properties continue to serve foods high in sugar, fat and salt, as exemplified by McDonald’s and Burger King outlets in some of our most prestigious hospitals, including Guy’s hospital in London and Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge.' 

Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, backed the MPs’ call and criticised hospitals for permitting the sale of fast food. 

He said: 'The NHS is being pennywise but pound-foolish selling junk food that ultimately just lands more people in hospital with expensive, preventable, obesity-driven illnesses. 

'So as these fast-food concessions come up for renewal, hospitals should demand healthier, tastier, affordable alternatives.'

The chain sells a range of sandwiches, pies and pasties - such as the cheese and bacon wrap, a chicken fajita slice, and beef and vegetable pasties - ranging from 300 calories to almost 600.

The hospital trust has joined forces with Wolverhampton Council to tackle the obesity crisis locally.

But Mr Loughton said banning the chain from the site would not solve anything.

He said: 'People say "ban the fast-food places" but I don't think that will ever work. We have to change people's mentality regarding the food they eat.'

In Devon, hospital chiefs have told staff not to allow deliveries from a new Pizza Hut - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park.

The move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.

Staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant, with bosses steering them towards 'healthier' sandwiches in the hospital's smoothie bar instead.

And a hospital in Surrey has came under fire when it emerged it had paid £24,000 to close a Burger King branch inside its own walls. 

Croydon University Hospital had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years, sparking the ire of health campaigners.

It finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a Costa Coffee branch.

But in order to terminate the contract it had to pay £24,000 to Compass UK, the company operating the fast food franchise.

Croydon Health Service admitted the 'world had changed' since it signed the original deal in 1997.

The news comes after the NHS announced last week that 700,000 overweight staff will be told to take part in free slimming classes to shed the pounds, in order to set a better example to their patients.

The drastic scheme could help nearly half of NHS England's 1.3 million workforce, who currently struggle with their weight.

In a drive to 'practice what we preach', the NHS will sign employees up to one of three slimming classes, depending on the amount of weight they have to lose.

Staff will be put on personal eating plans and be offered cognitive behavioural therapy to help reassess their relationship with food.

NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, who announced today's initiative, said: 'Today the NHS is starting to practice what we preach - helping our own staff get healthier and prevent illness.

Dr Sally Norton, an NHS consultant specialising in weight loss  surgery, says the NHS is contributing to the obesity crisis

Coffee shops offering sugar-laden drinks and cakes to hospital patients, visitors and NHS staff should be banned, a leading weight loss surgeon has said.

Dr Sally Norton, an NHS consultant specialising in weight loss and upper gastrointestinal surgery, said she no longer shakes the hands of her patients - more often than not because they arrive clutching a Costa take-out.

In the place of these popular coffee shops and fast food outlets, Dr Norton - who works at Bristol Royal Infirmary and Southmead Hospital - has called for restaurants and cafes championing local food producers and offering healthy and tasty snacks.

'We read every week, in The BMJ and other leading medical journals, of research detailing the perils of sugar and fizzy drinks,' said Dr Norton.

'We frequently hear laments about the cost to the NHS of the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which is threatening to engulf us.

'And yet, the NHS, which I understood to be an organisation that promotes and supports health (rather than just treating disease), is actually contributing to the problem.

'As a weight loss surgeon, I find it frustrating and, frankly, embarrassing to spend time in clinic, explaining to my patients how sugary drinks and snacks are one of the biggest drivers of obesity, when I know that just outside in our hospital foyer are not one, but two Costa coffee shops, as well as vending machines stocked full of coke and chocolate.

'When I try to grab a quick coffee from Costa, an obedient employee always tries to tempt me into buying one of their huge, sugar-laden and calorific cakes to go with it... hard to resist after a stressful morning in theatre or a busy night on-call.

'If I did need a snack, I would be hard pushed to find much that you could describe as healthy —there is very little fresh, nutrient-rich food and next to nothing that doesn't involve a load of refined carbs.
