A 17-year-old has created a line of snap-on underwear for those who struggle to put them on the normal way - one leg at a time.

Charlotte Robinson, who lives in South Salem, New York, came up with the idea for her line, No Guts No Glory, when she had to wear a large leg brace for 13 months. After being forced to wear itchy Velcro undergarments made by her mother, she learned to sew and started making her own snap-on underwear.

'It's nice to know you can have a pair of underwear that you can put on after surgery that's not too bad,' Charlotte told ABC News.

Turning lemons into lemonade! Charlotte Robinson stands with the Taylor Spatial Frame she had to wear for 13 months on her right leg. The brace gave her the idea for her line of snap-on underwear, No Guts No Glory

Charlotte was born with a rare disorder
 called hemangioma that caused vascular tumors to grow in her right 
tibia, preventing healthy leg growth. By the time she was 13, her right leg was 
misshapen and a full two and a half inches shorter than her left.

The week after she graduated eighth grade, Charlotte underwent a seven-hour surgery to 
correct the growth, and was forced to wear a Taylor Spatial Frame, a 
four-pound brace with large pins going directly into the leg bone.

The brace would stay on more than a year - and, Charlotte, who'd previously filled her spare time with tennis, took up sewing instead. She said the frame eventually started feeling like a 'part of' her.

'It can be tough at times with everyone always staring at your frame but what I came to learn is that people are intrigued by the frame. I had more guys coming up to me and asking me all about it because they thought it was "so cool,"' she says on her website.

'Everywhere I went I heard incredible stories, and every person gave me the same advice which was to not give up because it gets easier and life goes on'

'I met many interesting individuals who had faced all kinds of challenges in the past but you would never know it. I met an outstanding baker with only three fingers, a woman who had a tree fall on her in a storm and many others. Everywhere I went I heard incredible stories, and every person gave me the same advice which was to not give up because it gets easier and life goes on.'

Charlotte even met former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who lifted up his pants leg to show her his own brace.

The long and short of it: Before her surgery, Charlotte's left leg was two and a half inches taller than her right, due to a rare disorder that caused vascular tumors to grow on her right tibia

The frame eventually came off - and her leg had successfully responded to all the treatments.

'It was a long journey but well worth it as I gained 2.5 inches and am now back on the tennis courts!' she said to MailOnline.

Charlotte initially thought only others with Taylor Spatial Frames would be interested in her snap-on underwear, but realized there could be a larger interest after a followup operation. She overheard a patient next to her, who'd just had a scoliosis surgery, getting a lecture about how she could wear only snap-up pants.

'Snap, snap is all they have to do. No bending at all,' she reportedly told her mother.

Right now, Charlotte is offering No Guts No Glory underwear in two styles, three colors (red, black, and white) and three sizes (small, medium and large). They retail for $20 each.
