Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick against Bayern Munich on Tuesday night, and the Manchester City striker was still revelling in his success 24 hours later with a celebratory photo on Twitter.

The Argentine posted a picture of himself alongside the Champions League match ball from the game, signed by his team-mates.

At one stage, City looked close to another early European exit, but thanks to CSKA Moscow's late equaliser against Roma and Aguero's heroics, Manuel Pellegrini's men have it all to play for.

They are level on five points with two other teams in Group E, all of whom are fighting to join Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League.

At the Etihad on Tuesday, City looked dead and buried, but Aguero produced his 17th goal of the season in the 90th minute to ensure three points for his side. 

Man City play Roma away on 10th December, where their Champions League fate will be decided.
