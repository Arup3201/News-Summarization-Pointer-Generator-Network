A mother of two has hit out at ScotRail for a 'lack of sympathy' after she was hit by luggage which broke her ribs on a busy train.

Kate Robertson, 34, was travelling on a  service to Aberdeen when a suitcase fell from overhead storage, hitting her and breaking her ribs.

She taken off the train in agony while travelling with her two young children.

Kate, a careers advisor at Aberdeen University, said she felt let down after being offered a £10 voucher by ScotRail.

She said: 'You have to keep passageways clear. A man had put the suitcase up in an overhead rack to get it out of the way.

'It fell down on me as I was bending down to put my rucksack under a table.'

Kate had been returning from Milton Keynes when the incident happened, on her journey home from visiting her parents.

Kate was travelling with her two small children when the bag fell from the overhead compartment 

She had switched trains at Haymarket in Edinburgh, boarding the 4.32pm to Aberdeen.

The accident happened just minutes into the train journey, and Kate was taken off the train at Inverkeithing and transported by ambulance to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.

Kate, who was travelling with her children Oli, 4, and Emily, 2, said she feared the suitcase could have hit her daughter who was seated below it.

ScotRail's only response was to send Kate a £10 voucher, apparently telling her 'they weren't responsible' 

Earlier this month ScotRail sent Kate - who has been corresponding with the FirstGroup company - the travel voucher as a good-will gesture.

The firm had said she was due a £3 refund on the leg of the journey she missed.

Kate, from Kinneff, responded, saying: 'Because the suitcase owner said it was his fault, ScotRail said they weren't responsible.'

A spokeswoman for ScotRail said: 'We are sorry she was injured as a result of another passenger incorrectly storing their luggage.'
