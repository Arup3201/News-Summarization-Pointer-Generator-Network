Taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland today announced around it will axe 3,500 jobs over the next three years so it can downsize its investment banking arm.

The move at Global Banking and Markets (GBM) follows Government pressure for the 83 per cent state-owned bank to pull back from its ambitions to be a global investment player.

The job losses come amid reports that 
John Hourican, the head of GBM who is overseeing the 
business' restructure, is in line to pick up a huge £4 million in 
long-term incentive shares that he was awarded in 2009.

Jobs slashed: Royal Bank of Scotland announced it will be axing 3,500 jobs as it scales back its investment banking arm

RBS said the strategy was designed to 
help move toward the ring-fencing requirements outlined by the 
Independent Commission on Banking and adopted by the Government last 
year.

The recommendation called for banks to 
ring-fence their retail or high street operations from their riskier 
investment banking divisions.

The latest round of job cuts come on top of 2,000 losses announced by the bank last summer.

The new losses will mean nearly 11,000 posts have been cut at GBM from the pre-banking crisis headcount of 24,000.

GBM, which employs 18,900 worldwide and employs its workers in Stoke, Manchester, Edinburgh and London,  deals with a range of financial services such as debt advice, equity trading and mergers and acquisitions.

David Fleming, Unite national officer, slammed RBS’s decision to reduce the headcount at GBM as 'staggering'.

'It
is a disgrace that while on a daily basis stories are emerging about 
the massive bonuses at the top of the bank, increasing numbers of jobs 
are being cut from amongst the hard-working staff,' he said.

Meanwhile,
the bank said it would restructure GBM and cash management division 
Global Transaction Services (GTS), by splitting the businesses into two 
new divisions - Markets and International Banking.

The
changes include considering the sale or closure of its cash equities, 
equity capital markets and mergers and acquisitions businesses, which 
had income of around £220 million in the nine months to September and 
are currently unprofitable.

The
bank also said it was considering the sale of its corporate broking 
arm, renowned City broker Hoare Govett, which offers independent market 
advice to 100 listed companies, including 11 of the FTSE 100 index.

Hoare Govett was acquired in RBS’s disastrous £48 billion joint bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007.

Barclays announced plans to axe over 400 posts under 'essential changes' to its technology and infrastructure division.

The bank said it would make every effort to mitigate compulsory redundancies, pointing out that the 422 job losses represented 0.74 per cent of its UK staff.

David Fleming, national officer of the Unite union, said: 'The decision by Barclays Technology to cut 422 jobs is a New Year's blow for the staff.

'Unite has strongly opposed the sending of some of this work to Lithuania, when there are already highly trained workers carrying out this work.

'The vast majority of jobs will be going from Radbrooke Hall, Cheshire. There will also be jobs cut in Northampton and a scattering among other sites around the country.'

Barclays denied that work was being transferred to Lithuania.

GBM has suffered recently as market turbulence, driven by global recession fears, hit income - however, the division still recorded income of £1.1 billion in the three months to September 30.

RBS said it aims to reduce its balance sheet from £420 billion at the end of June to around £300 billion over the three-year period.

Chancellor George Osborne recently said the bank could 'go further' in its reforms and would shift its business strategy towards personal banking, small businesses and corporate banking in the UK.

While the downsizing of GBM satisfies Mr Osborne’s desire for RBS to scale back riskier activities, the revelation that Mr Hourican is set to receive a hefty performance-related payout will embarrass the Prime Minister who last weekend promised a crackdown on executive pay.

A binding vote for shareholders on executive salaries formed part of a proposal unveiled by David Cameron for a Government blitz on pay and bonuses in the City.

Last month, a long-awaited Financial Services Authority report said RBS was brought to its knees by “multiple poor decisions” and its “gamble” on buying ABN Amro.

The FSA blamed deficiencies in the management and culture at RBS prior to its £45.5 billion bailout and called for tougher rules to make bankers more accountable for their actions.
