Sheila Quadrini, the ex-wife of millionaire businessman Michael Quadrini, was tied up and doused in petrol during an attack at her Newcastle home

A woman subjected to a terrifying raid in her home has told how she thought she would be burned alive after her attackers tied her up and doused her in petrol.

Sheila Quadrini, the ex-wife of a nightclub tycoon, was held hostage for more than an hour at her house in Gosforth, Newcastle, as a gang ransacked her luxury detached home.

The 65-year-old was tied up during her ordeal and managed to struggle to a phone and dial 999 with her tongue after her attackers left.

Police are still appealing for information since the incident which happened on December 6 and no arrests have been made as yet.

Ms Quadrini has only just returned to the house  - which has been her home for the past 11 years  - almost a month on from the raid.

She said: 'It felt like it went on forever.

'When someone is constantly throwing petrol over you and asking you where the lighter is you think you're going to be killed.

'They were in the house a long time, but it felt like forever. I do feel lucky to be alive.'

Ms Quadrini believes she was targeted in a planned attack as she arrived at her home after a day at work at around 6.30pm.

While the grandmother was disabling her alarm, she felt a gloved hand reach behind her and cover her mouth.

She was forced into her living room by one of the gang as another two ran upstairs and searched through her belongings for valuables.

Ms Quadrini said: 'I think they were waiting for me.

'I have a regular routine so they must have known what time I would come home.

'It had to be planned, it can't have been an opportunist thing.They tied me up, poured petrol on me and ripped off the jewellery I was wearing.

'They kept asking me: 'Do you smoke?'

Millionaire businessman Michael Quadrini, was a Newcastle nightclub tycoon

The tycoon owned the Tuxedo Princess floating nightclub in Gateshead along with a string of bars and restaurants

Mr Quadrini and his floating nightclub. His company Absolute Leisure was valued at £15million ten years ago but ran into financial trouble in 2009

'At the time I thought it was a stupid question, but they must have been looking for a lighter.

'One of them stayed with me the whole time. He was like a raving lunatic. He just kept saying: "Where's the money, where's the money?

'He stayed with me constantly while the others went through everything.'

Ms Quadrini's attackers eventually fled with cash and jewellery leaving her still tied up and terrified.

She managed to free herself by struggling out of her Ugg boots which were bound with rope and with her hands still tied she made it to an upstairs phone and dialled 999 with her tongue.

She said: 'I waited until I heard silence and there was nobody there.

'I got my boots off and I was free to go up the stairs. I went into this sort of panic because you don't know if they are going to come back at that point.

'I would never have believed them. But you just do anything you can to get out of the situation.

'When I heard a voice on the other end of the phone I was so relieved. I thought I had come through it.'

Ms Quadrini, who works part time in an office, was too afraid to return home and has stayed with relatives since the raid.

The mother-of-one says she suffers flashbacks of the attack and was left shaken.

She said: 'I was in shock for a long while. I was in disbelief.

'For the first two weeks after it happened I felt like I was living in a nightmare.

'I had to have people doing everything for me.

'It took me more than a week to come back. I have had friends and family staying with me the whole time.

During the horrifying raid at her home, raiders left her trussed up for over an hour until she managed to dial 999 using her tongue

'I haven't been in the house by myself since. It was like the sort of thing you see on the television.

'The thing that stays with me the most is when I was at the front door and a hand came round my mouth.'

Mr Quadrini, whose family still run nightclubs in Leeds, said: 'I didn't want to come back home.

'It just didn't feel like home anymore. It just makes you feel very cold. But it is just something you have got to conquer.

'You have just got to put your life back together. Sometimes you can have all the security in the world and it makes no difference.

'There are high hedges all round my house, but sometimes privacy can work against you.'

A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'Enquiries into this incident are ongoing and we would appeal for anyone with information to come forward.'

Ms Quadrini's ex-husband Michael operated the Tuxedo Princess nightclub in the 1980s.

The Quadrini's have one son and divorced in 1985, but Sheila remained involved with the business.

Anyone with information should call Northumbria Police on 101.
