Multi-millionaire rapper Jay Z WILL be by his best pal Kanye West's side when he says 'I Do' to Kim Kardashian on Saturday, MailOnline can reveal.

A close family source has confirmed the star will stand up for his friend at the lavish ceremony to be held at Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.

Rumours that Jay Z would be the best man were originally dismissed, but the family member said he would be attending alongside his wife, superstar Beyoncé, adding: 'Beyoncé had to think about it at the last minute, she didn't really want to go, but I think Jay Z's the best man, so he's kind of making her go...

Final preparations: Kim and Kanye have been busy getting ready for the arrival of their guests in Paris on Friday and were seen in the French capital today wearing matching camel-coloured outfits

Everyone has been waiting to see whether the A-list couple will turn up to the European extravaganza that kicks off in Paris on Friday and then moves on to Florence.

They were said to be shying away from attending - but MailOnline understands they will now make an appearance after Kim and Kanye banned cameras for the Kardashians' E! reality show at the wedding.

Instead, the preparations for the big day will be caught on camera.

Kim tweeted earlier this month: 'We are not filming our wedding for Keeping Up With The Kardashians. You will see everything leading up til and after! As much as we would love to share these memories on camera, we've decided to keep this close to our heart & share thru photos.'

She also disputed reports they had finalized a massive guest list, adding: 'No guest list has been released. Seeing fake ones. Especially not 1600 people invited like I just read. Its VERY small & intimate 4. Seeing fake wedding dress pics of me. No one has seen my dress! Those photos are old or photo shopped. That's it! Unless you hear it from us please don't believe nonsense!'

And the family member confirmed there were just 150 guests invited to the wedding.

While they may not be natural born best friends, Beyoncé has done her best to be polite to Kim.

The pair were seen sitting together at the 2012 BET Awards in Los Angeles -with Jay Z and Kanye separating them - and Kim invited the singer to her baby shower last year on June 2.

And when Kim gave birth to daughter North on June 15, Beyoncé, the mother of Blue Ivy, now two, posted a picture of Kim and Kanye looking totally in love, writing: 'Congratulations Kim and Kanye, enjoy this beautiful moment together.'

Beyoncé and Jay Z will join guests including singer John Legend and his model wife Chrissy Teigen, Kim's best friends Brittny Gastineau and Jonathan Cheban, and LaLa Anthony and Larsa Pippen .

Designer and New York socialite Rachel Roy, who was invited when Kanye proposed to Kim at San Francisco's AT&T Park in October, is also expected - just weeks after being involved in a widely reported row with Beyonce's younger sister Solange at a Met Gala after-party.
