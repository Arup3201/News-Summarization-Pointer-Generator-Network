On the rack: Former HMRC tax chief Dave Hartnett was accused of being 'cavalier' with public money

The former head of HMRC faced growing criticism yesterday over claims he failed to pursue prosecutions against HSBC’s Swiss customers before taking a job with the bank.

Critics accused the agency of adopting a ‘selective prosecution policy’ towards tax evasion cases linked to Britain’s biggest bank and questioned whether it had taken a deliberate strategy to minimise legal action.

Dave Hartnett was permanent secretary for tax at HMRC when French authorities handed over account data in 2010. Yet just three cases were passed to the Crown Prosecution Service and there has been only one conviction.

He retired as Britain’s top tax official in 2012 and took up a job as an adviser with HSBC in 2013 – a move which was signed off by the Prime Minister.

Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, told the Mail it was ‘totally unacceptable’ for Mr Hartnett to move to HSBC after his job at HMRC. ‘It’s all too cosy,’ he said. ‘It demonstrates that the HMRC has not been fit for purpose for some time.’

Mr Hartnett, 63, retired from HMRC after facing criticism that he signed off ‘sweetheart’ deals which saved Starbucks and Vodafone to avoid billions in tax payments.

His tenure at the Revenue was dogged by claims that he helped multinational companies shave millions of pounds off their tax bills. Described as Britain’s most ‘wined and dined’ civil servant, he sparked controversy when it emerged he enjoyed 107 meals with corporate giants over a three-year period.

He was severely criticised for brokering a deal that saved Goldman Sachs £20million in interest payments and stepped down after he was accused of lying to MPs over the deal and being ‘cavalier’ with taxpayers’ money.

A 2013 court case heard Mr Hartnett personally overruled legal advice and HMRC’s own guidelines to order officials to stop chasing the bank over the tax bill.

High Court judge Mr Justice Nicol ruled the deal was lawful but ‘not a glorious episode in the history of the revenue’.

When it later emerged he had taken advisory roles with HSBC and City giant Deloitte, the chairman of the public accounts committee Margaret Hodge accused him of ‘greed’ and ‘losing all sense of what is right’.

MPs on the committee are due to question HMRC chief executive Lin Homer about the leaked Swiss account details and Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint is also expected to be called to face questions later this year.

Mrs Hodge has said she would ‘order’ executives at the beleaguered bank to give evidence if necessary. Mr Hartnett was last night unavailable for comment, but has previously denied that HSBC’s private banking customers were offered an amnesty.

In a 2011 statement, he warned HMRC was closing in on offshore tax evaders and said bank customers whose details were among the stolen data should come forward.

He said: ‘This is not an amnesty. There are no special rates of penalty or interest for those who come forward voluntarily.’

‘This is an opportunity for those who have made errors in past returns to correct them. The net is closing on offshore evaders.’
