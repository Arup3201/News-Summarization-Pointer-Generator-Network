The Football League have axed nine members of their commercial staff as part of a total revamp of the department as they seek increasingly elusive new sponsors.

The changes will include Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey taking overall charge of commercial business. But there is no direct replacement for former director Richard Heaselgrave, now with Tennis Australia, whose team and structure have been dismantled, with a third of the department losing their jobs.

Heaselgrave was made the scapegoat for the League losing a lucrative title sponsorship with B&Q at the final contract stage and having to make do instead with a budget deal involving bookmakers Sky Bet.

The FA have also adopted a different approach — copying Manchester United’s example — to finding new backers. But so far this has not paid dividends, with the FA Cup still lacking a backer and the televised first round fast approaching.

The FA say they are having many conversations with potential backers but don’t want to put a time frame on attracting a £9million-a-year replacement for Budweiser.

Demand for next year’s Rugby World Cup tickets is such that a ballot will be needed in some categories for all 48 games. But it also means England Rugby 2015 are working with City of London police to ensure touts do not derail the system. Police are also involved in apprehending those now known to be responsible for fake Ryder Cup tickets.

The FA of Ireland, who were slated by Roy Keane over training facilities before the 2002 World Cup, can rest easy ahead of the launch of Keane’s second autobiography next week. The FAI are let off the hook this time, which is understandable given they now employ Keane as Martin O’Neill’s assistant manager.

Royal Ascot are believed to have finally ended a tortuous recruitment process to find a new chief executive that has lasted a year and led to current boss Charles Barnett having to delay his retirement. The appointment comes from outside racing and has been working in the City for a FTSE 250 company. Headhunters Spencer Stuart, who had to start again after their original shortlist of candidates was rejected by Ascot, have also found a successor for CEO Peter Dawson at the R&A in half the time it took to satisfy Ascot.

Moores ‘mum’ on KP

England coach Peter Moores, who is sure to be high on Kevin Pietersen’s hit list in his book published next week, had the ideal platform to get in the first punch when he surprisingly provided the editorial for the latest edition of The Cricketer magazine.

But with the ECB waiting to see what KP says first, Moores provided a bland overview of last summer’s cricket, avoiding the exiled batsman.

Pietersen is understood to have been given a great nickname by his team-mates during the doomed Ashes tour last winter. He was called Harvey Norman after the Australian electrical goods retailer who champion ‘zero interest’.

Meanwhile, The Cricketer’s new editor-at-large Simon Hughes faces a potential conflict of interests in his other new role on the main MCC committee. An MCC spokesman said Hughes would be asked to leave meetings if there is a clash, like previous members of the media serving on the committee.

The struggling trade paper Racing Post is increasingly the subject of attack from racehorse trainers upset about its bias towards betting news and the poor information service since the paper refused to pay for racing data from the official source after it hugely increased the price. Kim Bailey called it a ‘betting rag, obsessed with pages of tips’ and presumed a Leicester race for 2-year-olds, wrongly detailed as a 5mile 2furlong trip, must have been a ‘trial for the Mongolian derby’.

Fellow trainer George Baker said Bailey’s comments were ‘supported by so many in the industry’ and the Post had ‘lazy, slapdash writing’. Racing Post editor Bruce Millington countered: ‘There has been no change in the Post’s emphasis and, like every newspaper, we make a small number of mistakes.’
