A couple who won £161m on the lottery has donated £3m to the Scottish Independence campaign, effectively bankrolling their push to be separated from the UK.

Colin and Chris Weir from Ayrshire, Scotland, have become Britain's biggest political donors in the past 15 months, after handing over huge sums to Alex Salmond and the Yes vote.

The pair, who scooped the huge Euromillions jackpot in 2011, have overtaken Tory donor, Michael Farmer, founder of the RK Capital hedge fund.

Political donors: Colin Weir and Chris Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire, have given £3m of their Euromillions jackpot to the Yes Campaign in Scotland

Financial backing: They are effectively bankrolling the pro-independence movement, led by First Minister Alex Salmond

Donations made by individuals (Sunday Times Rich List)

1. Colin and Chris Weir: £3,000,000 (Yes Scotland/SNP)

2. Michael Farmer: £1,052,304 (Conservative)

3. James Lupton: £1,027,800 (Conservative)

4. Ian Taylor: £634,77 (Conservative/Better Together)

5. = John Griffin: £500,000 (Conservative)

= May Makhzoumi: £500,000 (Conservative)

7.Chris Rokos: £329,000 (Conservative)

8. Andrew Law: £307,077 (Conservative)

9. Lord Bamford and family: £299,687 (Conservative)

10. Lord Palumbo of Southwark: £286,552 (Liberal Democrats)

The couple, who have been married for more than 30 years, have given at least £2m to the SNP and the Yes Scotland Campaign in the last few months.

It is a massive increase on the £1m the pair handed over in 2013.

Colin, who was an STV cameraman, and his wife Chris, a nursing manager, are now completely funding the pro-independence campaign

They have raked in more than three times the amount of donations received by the opposing Better Together campaign.

Analysis by the Sunday Times has shown the Scottish referendum has captured around 30 per cent of political donations since the beginning of 2013.

Yes Scotland has £2m, all from the Weirs, while the opposing Better Together Campaign only has £863,000.

The surge in funds has prompted the Yes vote to carry out one of the country's biggest advertising campaigns.

The opposing Better Together campaign, led by former Chancellor Alastair Darling, has struggled to come up with similar funds to their rivals.

A poll conducted by the pro-independence political website Wings Over Scotland earlier this month
found that when the 14 per cent of voters who are undecided are 
excluded, 47 per cent intend to vote yes and 53 per cent no.

Women voters are currently far less 
likely to support independence than men, with the most recent poll 
finding 27 per cent intend to vote ‘Yes’ compared with 46 per cent of 
men.

To cement his appeal, 
Mr  Salmond also pledged ‘high quality, universal childcare  and early 
learning for all of Scotland’s children’. The promise comes in addition 
to a previous flagship pledge to extend free childcare.

However other polls have suggested the vote could be neck-and-neck.

It was also revealed today that Alex Salmond wants Prince Charles to be crowned King of Scots in a separate coronation.

The First Minister says monarchs should be crowned in both England and Scotland if he succeeds in breaking up the UK.

At the same time Mr Salmond, in a strong signal to republicans in his own party, has firmly ruled out a future referendum on ditching the monarchy.

Rich: The pair from Largs, Ayrshire, became Britain's biggest jackpot winners in 2011 when they took home just over £161m

Going forward: Polls predicting the outcome of September's referendum have begun to balance out after a surge in support for Alex Salmond
