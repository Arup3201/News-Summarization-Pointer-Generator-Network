The current England international week being the last for four months will sharpen minds at the FA over if and when to extend manager Roy Hodgson’s contract which runs until 2016.

Only a few months ago there was significant criticism of the FA for giving Hodgson a deal until Euro 2016 in France, ahead of what turned out to be a dismal England showing at the World Cup. 

Yet such is the speed at which the football calendar turns that the draw for the 2018 World Cup qualifying competition takes place in St Petersburg next July.

The decision to keep Hodgson on came after a poor showing at the World Cup in Brazil in the summer

And it is always an uncomfortable situation when an England manager has to give his views on fixtures when he might no longer be in charge of the team — as happened with both Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson.

There are those on the FA board who believe the England manager should be judged from tournament to tournament with no need for the long-term contracts, such as the bewildering six-year agreement the RFU have given head coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup on home soil.

But by the time the FA delegation arrives in Russia next summer, England might have already secured their place in the Euros and with no obvious successor — especially with Brendan Rodgers’ stock falling — the FA could easily award Hodgson two more years.

The FA say they have yet to decide who will go to St Petersburg and have no intention of talking about Hodgson’s contract.

The FA, who take birthday celebrations very seriously, have already started planning for the 50th anniversary of the World Cup win in 2016. 

But the great difficulty for the FA will be avoiding the landmark developing into another inquest of why there has been no repeat during 50 years of hurt. 

The initial thought is to focus on the whole tournament, including North Korea’s involvement, rather than just England’s isolated victory.

David Bernstein, former FA chairman who would have always travelled at the front of the plane with the England team, was spotted back in the economy seats on a European flight last week.

Bernstein, who had been desperate to carry on at the FA past the limit of his 70th birthday, is now chairman of the Red Cross board of trustees and admirably didn’t want to waste his charity’s funds on business-class travel.

Meanwhile, the football memorabilia lots including Ray Wilson and Jimmy Greaves’s World Cup winning medals being auctioned on Tuesday were close to having Bobby Charlton’s shirt from the 1966 World Cup quarter-final which he swapped with Argentinian Silvio Marzolini despite manager Sir Alf Ramsey calling the opposition ‘animals’. 

But agents acting for Marzolini, who previously loaned his prize possession to the Old Trafford museum, could not agree a price.

Twickenham's botched planning for the autumn international series was not limited to decimating the West Car park for commercial gain. 

The new ticket scanners were so unreliable that large queues formed outside and a considerable number of fans missed the Haka and anthems until gates were opened to allow them in manually.

The RFU said the glitches will be sorted out before the South Africa game.

No World Cup for Brian 

BBC Radio 5 Live are expected to win main UK radio rights for the Rugby World Cup after protracted talks, that have gone on for over a year with the International Rugby Board. 

That will be a relief for those who had to put up with the unintelligible Brian Moore as chief pundit on talkSPORT in New Zealand in 2011. His station are likely to receive the secondary news update rights package.

Meanwhile, World Cup broadcasters ITV, who have loaned Sky Sports rugby talent in the past, are now reportedly more impressed with the way BT cover the sport.

An unlikely wearer of a World Bowl winner’s ring, while watching Dallas Cowboys dominate Jacksonville Jaguars in Wembley’s NFL game, was Crystal Palace’s chief executive Phil Alexander. In a previous life, Alexander was kicker for the London Monarchs who beat Barcelona Dragons 21-0 in 1991.
