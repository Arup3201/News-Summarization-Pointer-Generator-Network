Gwyneth Paltrow and her estranged husband Chris Martin have made it into Yale's top ten quote list for 2014.

It was a statement on their website announcing their separation on March 25, 2014, which caught the eye of Fred Shapiro, an associate director at Yale Law School's library who compiled the selection.

'We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent, we will be able to continue in the same manner,' the note read.

Pearls of wisdom: Gwyneth Paltrow and her estranged husband Chris Martin have made it into Yale's top ten quote list for 2014

Meanwhile, former Yale Law School student and first lady Hilary Clinton nabbed two spots on the esteemed top ten list.

One revelation was from an ABC News interview in July where she told how she and her family 'came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.'

'I can't breathe!' - the exclamation made by a black man, Eric Garner, while being placed in a police chokehold - was chosen as the most notable quote of the year 

'I can't breathe!' - the exclamation made by a black man, Eric Garner, while being placed in a police chokehold - was chosen as the most notable quote of the year.

Edit: The original Yale Book of Quotations was published in 2006, and Shapiro has updated it with an annual list of the top ten quotes

It was one of several quotes chosen for the list released Tuesday that reflect tumult over race in America in 2014, particularly in the criminal justice system. 

Shapiro said he had already completed the list without Garner's quote but revised it as protests grew following a grand jury's decision last week to not indict a white officer in his death.

Garner had gasped 'I can't breathe' on July 17 as he was being arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.

Also making the list was 'Hands up! Don't shoot!' - a chant of demonstrators protesting the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed during a confrontation with a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

Another quote that sparked conversations about race was made by former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to his mistress, V. Stiviano. 

An audio recording of the comment, in which he took issue with her 'associating' with black people, led the NBA to ban Sterling.

The original Yale Book of Quotations was published in 2006, and Shapiro has updated it with an annual list of the top ten quotes.

'These are not necessarily quotes I agree with or quotes I think are eloquent or admirable,' he said. 

He said quotes are chosen because they are famous or important or reflect the spirit of the times.
