Kim Kardashian's aunt - and self-proclaimed 'crazy' relative - has revealed she will NOT be attending the reality star's lavish third wedding, insisting: 'I've been to Kim's weddings, two of them, and I've been to Paris.'

Karen Houghton, 55, who is the younger sister of Kim's mom Kris Jenner, said she was more concerned with the wildfires sweeping near her San Diego County home.

And speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said Kim phoned her yesterday and offered to buy her a ticket so she can attend her marriage to rapper Kanye West, which kicks off in Paris on Friday.

But Karen admitted: 'I said "well let me call you back". I'd stay at the Four Seasons and all that, but I used to be a stewardess - traveling and all of that is not a big deal to me.'

Karen, who has been outspoken about her millionaire sister Kris - and recently told how Bruce Jenner walked out on her because he was fed up of all her yelling - said despite everything she was happy for Kim.

And she believes this union will last longer than Kim's second marriage to basketball player Kris Humphries in 2011, laughing: 'I think this one's going to work. I think 
it's going to be more then 72 days!

'I think it's 
going to work, I mean look at Nori, how adorable. I just love them and 
hope they're happy.'

Kim, 33, and Kanye, 36, are hosting an intimate group of 150 guests, according to Karen, who said that even her mother Mary Jo Shannon doesn't know the exact location of the wedding yet. adding: 'Kanye's calling the
 people a half hour before and saying "here's where it is". I can't even
 tell you where it is.'

'I think this one is going to work. I think it's going to be more than 72 days!'

It's believed that celebrations will start on Friday night in Paris with a guided tour of Le Palais de Versailles, and on Saturday morning, guests will be flown by private jet 700 miles away to witness the ceremony at the imposing Forti d Belvedere in Florence, Italy.

And Karen said she would have 'absolutely' gone had her home not been at risk of damage from local wildfires, saying: 'Six o'clock in the morning they called me yesterday and said, "Well are 
you coming, are you coming?"'

'I said "You know, I just don't know with the fires..." It was absolutely the scariest thing I have ever been through. Everyone was evacuated and my house is a mess from the fires.'

The care worker and part-time nurse, who works in an old people's home, said: 'I have to work till 8pm, then I guess I could catch a red eye or something.

'I'm afraid to leave - the fire could go all over my c**p. If your house was going to burn down would you go to Paris? Screw it - I've been to two weddings of Kim! But I'm really happy for her and I do have a present for her.'

Karen, who has a 15-year-old daughter called Natalie, also said she did not want to leave her daughter at home alone. Natalie has been invited to the wedding - but does not want to attend without her boyfriend, who is not on the guest list.

She has frequently been outspoken when her sister Kris, 58, has riled her. Last month, Karen told Radar that despite Kris and her estranged husband Bruce looking friendly there would be NO reunion.

Karen said: 'Bruce left. He walked out on her, and I think he’s not coming back. He couldn’t take the yelling anymore and stuff.'

And she said Kris was not taking the split well, adding: 'I think she’s got issues right now because Bruce left her. 'Kris is alone, she’s not dating. She’s not the type to run around.'

She made the comments after writing on her Facebook page in April: 'Pray for Kris Jenner she needs it…crazy. Shes as nutcase [sic].

'She doesn’t need prayers she needs sky vodka hahaha hahaha hahaha.' And explaining her somewhat harsh views, Karen said  'I get p***ed off at her because she doesn’t respond to me. If you think your sister would call you back, she doesn’t. And it hurts me.'

Karen - who lives two hours from her sister in San Marcos, California - blames her sibling's celebrity status and hunger for fame and fortune.

She said: 'I don’t care how much money you have or who you are, you’re my sister. I’m not afraid of her. I can’t get to her anymore. But I guess it’s the money.

'She’s a huge celebrity and now she has changed. I’m not saying good or bad. But I’ve seen what it can do to Kris… ever since she moved to L.A.'

Admitting 
she has had run-ins with Kris - mainly to do with caring for their aging
 mother, Karen told MailOnline: 'I called up Kris yelling at her, because I was 
like, "You need to help your mom more and you know it." And I think that she kind of got the message.I was screaming - I don't even care.

'I
 don't care about stuff and I don't care what anyone thinks of me. I'm 
the character of the family, I just talked to my nephew Rob before he 
left for the wedding and he said "I just kind of feel like the black 
sheep of the family because I'm so heavy", and I said, "Rob, who cares, 
just go," so he went.'

Final
 preparations: The couple have been busy putting the finishing touches 
to their big day which will be this weekend and stepped out in matching 
camel coloured outfits on Wednesday 

Despite posing by a Mercedes her sister bought her on Valentine's Day, Karen said: 'I'm not materialistic, I'm more into animals and charities.'

Even though if she left this morning, Karen could still make the wedding. She said: 'I was a stewardess for two airlines, I've been 
to Paris, it's beautiful, I love Europe. But this marriage... I don't 
know. The fires are what screwed things
 up, I couldn't do anything. I'm packing up my hall instead of packing for 
Paris.

'I take my work very seriously, I'm a
 nurse and I went to four years of college for it.

'I also work on an animal charity and they wanted me to go tomorrow, I have five dogs.'

However, Karen made it clear that blood is truly
 thicker than water, saying: 'I love Kris, I love all of my family. I 
even love Kanye - even though everyone seems to hate him, why is that? I love him, 
you know he's been nothing but nice to me.'

And in a touching Facebook post to her niece, Karen wrote: 'I'm so very happy for my adorable precious niece...Kimberly deserves the world, so happy, aunt K.'

Congrats: Although she won't go to the wedding, Karen Houghton sends her love to niece Kim
