Suspended Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson is set to return to the BBC - to guest host its top-rating satire show Have I Got News For You. 

It has emerged the star has been scheduled to record the popular show in May - despite currently being the subject of an internal investigation - in a revelation which is likely to cause BBC bosses further embarrassment. 

Jimmy Mulville from production company Hat Trick, which makes Have I Got News For You, told the Broadcasting Press Guild that he thought Clarkson was 'a fantastic broadcaster'.

Suspended Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson is set to return to the BBC - to host its top-rating satire show Have I Got News For You

It has emerged the star, seen leaving his home today, has been scheduled to record the show in May - despite currently being the subject of an internal investigation

Wearing a black leather jacket and a white sports shirt, the suspended presenter of BBC's Top Gear wound down the window of his black Mercedes as he drove off

He said: 'As far as I'm concerned he is hosting Have I Got News for You, the BBC has not told me what to do yet and it will be an interesting conversation'.

He joked: 'Maybe we will get the producer on so he can hit Jeremy Clarkson live on television.'

Clarkson was suspended following a 'fracas' with Oisin Tymon, one of the motoring show's producers, over a steak dinner.

 Clarkson's contract runs out in March, and it is not clear whether it will be renewed, or whether Clarkson himself will opt to leave the BBC amid rumours that he could move to ITV in a lucrative deal

The BBC has now launched an inquiry into what happened and Ken MacQuarrie, the senior BBC executive tasked with sorting out the awkward affair, is believed to be in London and starting work.

Clarkson's contract runs out in March, and it is not clear whether it will be renewed, or whether Clarkson himself will opt to leave the BBC amid rumours that he could move to ITV in a lucrative deal. 

Top Gear has been pulled off air while the investigation is carried out.

Clarkson is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and all three men's contracts expire three days later. 

The BBC declined to comment on whether Clarkson's suspension, if it were still in force, would cover an appearance on a separate show. 

The news comes as the racing driver who was the first Stig on Top Gear has said that the BBC show would lose its 'fire' without the embattled Clarkson.

Perry McCarthy, who was the show's resident racing driver between 2002 to 2003, said that Top Gear without Clarkson simply 'won't work'.

He said: 'I think you're going to have a diluted product.

'I don't think it will have the value that it did, here and overseas.'

'And God help any soul who takes his place, because that's like signing up for your own firing squad. 

'The only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose.'
