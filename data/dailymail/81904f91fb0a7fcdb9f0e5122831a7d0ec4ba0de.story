Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the case of suspected police killer Eric Frein, who went on the run for 48 days after allegedly murdering a police officer and seriously injuring another.

'Cop killer' Frein, 31, has been charged with 12 offences, including first-degree murder, terrorism and the possession of weapons of mass destruction.

Prosecutors had previously said they would seek the death penalty and on Tuesday they submitted the formal paperwork. 

He is accused of shooting two state troopers, killing Corporal Byron Dickson and injuring Trooper Alex T Douglass. The shootings sparked a seven-week manhunt in eastern Pennsylvania.

In documents seen by MailOnline, prosecutors state: 'The Commonwealth is seeking the death penalty in connection with the death of Byron K. Dickson, II, upon conviction of the crime of Murder in the First Degree.'

It adds: 'If the Defendant is convicted of First Degree Murder...the Commonwealth intends to present testimony concerning the victim and victim impact testimony during the sentencing phase from the employer, co-workers, friends and family of Byron K. Dickson, II.' 

Frein's arraignment is scheduled to take place tomorrow at 1pm in the Pike County Court of Common Pleas in Milford, Pennsylvania.

It is expected his court appearance will be by video link with the Pike County Correctional Facility.

CNN reported that Frein's lawyer said the move was 'expected'.

Attorney Michael Weinstein said: 'There's a lot of work ahead, and there's just so much more to do. 

'Right now, it's all just in the early stages, so once we get the evidence laid out we can go from there.'

According to an affidavit filed in Pike County, Frein allegedly told investigators that he 'wanted to make a change (in government) and that voting was insufficient to do so, because there was no one worth voting for.' 

Police searched for him for 48 days and authorities scoured almost all of the Pocono Mountains during the manhunt.

They eventually discovered him walking towards an abandoned airport hangar in the middle of a field in Tannersville, Pennsylvania.

At the time of his arrest, Frein had made his way on to the FBI's Most Wanted list and an award of $100,000 was being offered for any information that led to his arrest.

Frein managed to evade authorities for seven weeks thanks to his survivalist skills. 

Using dogs, thermal imaging technology and other tools, law enforcement officials combed miles of forest as they hunted for the suspect, who they called 'an experienced survivalist at home in the woods'. 

Trackers found items they believe Frein hidden or abandoned in the woods — including soiled diapers, empty packs of Serbian cigarettes, an AK-47-style assault rifle and ammunition, and two pipe bombs that were functional and capable of causing 'significant damage'.

They also discovered a journal, allegedly kept by Frein and found in a bag of trash at a hastily abandoned campsite, that offered a chilling account of the ambush and his subsequent escape into the woods.

The journal's author described Dickson as falling 'still and quiet' after being shot twice.

Officials warned Frein was armed and extremely dangerous and closed schools and urged residents to be alert and cautious.

At his funeral, Cpl Dickson was described as a 'devoted husband and father' and an 'impeccable' ex-Marine who took his work seriously, but who also enjoyed making wooden toys for his young sons and finding humor in everyday situations.

Trooper Alex Douglass was shot in the pelvis and critically injured in the ambush, which took place during a late-night shift change at a local barracks. 

Frein has been charged with first-degree murder, murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first-degree murder, possession of weapons of mass destruction, discharging a firearm into an occupied structure and reckless endangerment.
