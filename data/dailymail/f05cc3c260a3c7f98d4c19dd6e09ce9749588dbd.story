He's the remarkable GP who works 100 hours a week despite being past retirement age and is described as ‘one in a million’ by his patients.

As well as providing medical care, Dr John Cormack has even gone to the lengths of springing a patient from hospital so he did not miss his 50th wedding anniversary party – wheeling him in to the theme from The Great Escape.

And he drove a widow on a 260-mile round trip to see a football match to cheer her up.

Last night, his efforts above and beyond the call of duty were recognised when he was declared overall winner at the Daily Mail’s Health Hero Awards, in association with Boots and ITV’s This Morning.

Dr Cormack and four other winners were earlier invited to a reception at No 10 where Prime Minister David Cameron hailed their ‘incredible dedication and compassion’.

The awards celebrate the unsung heroes of the Health Service.

Dr Cormack, 67, who runs Greenwood Surgery in South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, was presented with his award at a gala dinner at the Marriott Hotel, Grosvenor Square, hosted by This Morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford.

Personalities attending included Esther Rantzen, Jeff Brazier and Barry Cryer.

He received his award and prize of a £5,000 holiday from public health minister Jane Ellison.

Ian Gillard, who nominated him, said: ‘He can’t do enough for others. He’s the sort of GP who opens the surgery on Saturdays to give an urgent blood test, and works Bank Holidays so his patients don’t have to queue in A&E.

Fellow winners: Trisha Milbanke, a cleaner on a geriatric ward at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, stays on after her eight-hour shifts to do unofficial 'overtime', helping frail and vulnerable patients. Right, Dr Richard Appleton, a paediatric neurologist at Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool, was nominated by Coleen Rooney's parents, Tony and Colette McLoughlin, after his devotion to their daughter Rosie, who died last year from a brain disorder aged 14

‘He pops in to make cups of tea for the elderly and infirm, and on weekends he’ll visit patients in hospital. He gives terminally ill patients his mobile number, insisting he’s on duty 24 hours a day.’

But his care goes far beyond the medical. When he heard a 75-year-old widow and lifelong West Ham fan had never been to a match, he spent a Saturday driving her on a 260-mile round trip to see them play at Southampton.

Another patient recovering from surgery was going to miss his 50th wedding anniversary party. So Dr Cormack sprang him from hospital, drove him to the party and later returned him.

‘Dr Cormack is one in a million,’ said Mr Gillard. ‘All his patients love him to bits.’

Awards: Tireless work to improve the lives of patients with eating disorders led to an award for Carol Bennett, a nurse at Savernake Hospital, Marlborough. Right, volunteer Ian Fraser, from Dawlish, Devon, gives up 30 hours a week for a befriending charity set up by a GP practice

Last night Dr Cormack said: ‘It’s the most fulfilling job. My approach to being a GP is that you’re not just there to prescribe pills to your patients – they’re your friends, too, and it’s nice for me to be able to help them.’

Fellow winners include volunteer Ian Fraser, from Dawlish, Devon, who gives up 30 hours a week for a befriending charity set up by a GP practice.

Despite retiring seven years ago with ill health, he visits up to 30 people a day and organises activities at care homes.

Dr Richard Appleton, a paediatric neurologist at Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool, was nominated by Coleen Rooney’s parents, Tony and Colette McLoughlin, after his devotion to their daughter Rosie, who died last year from a rare brain disorder aged 14.

Trisha Milbanke, a cleaner on a geriatric ward at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital, stays on after her eight-hour shifts to do unofficial ‘overtime’, helping frail and vulnerable patients.

Meanwhile, tireless work to improve the lives of patients with eating disorders led to an award for Carol Bennett, a nurse at Savernake Hospital, Marlborough.

She just ‘oozes’ compassion, said her unit matron, Rachel Cootes. Her dedication extends to giving patients beauty treatments to boost self-esteem, or visiting those struggling at home.

In a message to all the finalists, Mr Cameron said: ‘People working in the NHS do a fantastic job and make a real difference to people’s lives every single day.

'The awards celebrate the very best of that care and you have been chosen by the judges because of the incredible dedication and compassion you provide in caring for others.’
