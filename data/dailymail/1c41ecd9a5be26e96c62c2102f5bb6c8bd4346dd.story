Energy secretary Ed Davey claimed the green business interests of energy watchdog chief John Gummer were not conflict of interest

Energy Secretary Ed Davey has admitted he knew former Tory Minister John Selwyn Gummer had green business interests when he chose him to head the powerful government watchdog that sets targets for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions.

But he insisted they did not amount to a conflict of interest – on the grounds they only concerned ‘infrastructure’, not renewable power generation. Last night critics dismissed this view as ‘absurd’.

The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year that Mr Gummer, now Lord Deben, is chairman of both Veolia Water UK, which connects windfarms to the National Grid, and the Climate Change Committee.

The committee’s stringent, binding targets are the main reason why the Grid is set to spend £25 billion on its network by 2020 – a big factor in soaring household energy bills.

This newspaper’s disclosure about Veolia Water UK triggered a long correspondence – published last week after a Freedom of Information Act request – between MPs, Lord Deben and Mr Davey.

The latter said in a letter in May that he knew about Veolia’s energy business, but there was no conflict of interest because the firm was ‘mainly involved in infrastructure projects’. 

Labour MP Graham Stringer, a prominent climate sceptic, was scathing about Mr Davey’s role: ‘The whole of our energy policy has been distorted by green lobbyists. To say there is no conflict because Veolia is only involved in energy infrastructure is patently absurd.’

Last night The Mail on Sunday asked Lord Deben how much Veolia is paying him and how he could avoid making Climate Committee decisions that might benefit the firm. He did not respond.
