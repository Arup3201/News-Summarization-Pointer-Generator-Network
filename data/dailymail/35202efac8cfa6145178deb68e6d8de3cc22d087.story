A Phoenix father has been charged with manslaughter and child abuse for allegedly leaving his 3-month-old son to bake in a hot car while he smoked marijuana with co-workers. 

It over 100 degrees at midday on Wednesday when 31-year-old father Daniel Gray left his infant son Jamison in the car outside of his work.

Gray says he was checking in at the sports bar where he works as a kitchen manager, when he lost track of time.

By the time he realized he left Jamison in the car, it was too late and the infant couldn't be revived.

Usually prosecutors have a hard time punishing the parents who lose their children this way.

'There are circumstances where we look at the situation and have to determine that even the most attentive parent might have made a similar decision that again resulted in a horrific accident,' Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery told Fox 10.

Mistake: 3-month-old Jamison died from exposure after his father left him in a parked car to check in at work on an over 100-degree day

His story: Gray says he was checking in on the sports pub where he works as a kitchen manager when he left Jamison in the car and lost track of time. But authorities believe he was actually smoking marijuana with coworkers for over an hour

Charged: Gray was arrested Thursday and charged with manslaughter and child abuse. Above, he is seen returning to the sports bar to retrieve his car

However, police suspect that it wasn't just that he lost track of time. According to police spokesman Sgt Tommy Thompson, they believe that he was smoking marijuana with a coworker at the time.

Gray was arrested Thursday night on charges of manslaughter and child abuse.

Mourning: According to a blog post by Jamison's aunt, the boy's mother has taken time off work to mourn her son's early death

While Gray faces legal ramifications for his actions, the rest of the family mourns the loss of newborn Jamison.

Jamison was born this past May 28. According to a post on his aunt's blog, Jamison's mother is currently taking time off from work to deal with the tragic loss.

'Our family is beyond devastated,' the aunt wrote. 'There are no words to describe the pain and heartache we are experiecing.'
