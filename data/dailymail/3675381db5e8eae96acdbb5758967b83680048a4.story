A devoted grandmother lost an incredible nine stone after doctors told her she would not live to see the children grow up.

Janice Lomas, 64, who works as a nursing assistant for the NHS, was having problems breathing and struggling to walk.

Weighing in at 17st 12lbs, Janice was forced to take time off work because of bad health in 2011, but when Janice went to the doctor she was told that she didn't have any medical problems besides being overweight.

After drastically overhauling the ‘chip pan’ diet that she was brought up on and taking up walking, Janice’s weight has fallen to 8st 5lbs over the last two years.

She said: ‘I had tests and was shocked when I was told it was my weight.

‘I have four grandchildren and they were aged between five and 10. I was told that I wouldn't live long enough to see them grow up.’

‘If I was going to live to see them into adulthood and enjoy my life with them then I had to do something about it.’

She said: ‘I was brought up in Scotland out of a chip pan. Now I stop when I've had enough and I cook differently. Everything I buy is as low-fat as possible. I don't really eat sweet things any more.’

Previously unable to walk 500m without suffering backache, Janice now strolls two miles to her daughter's house in Walkden, Salford, every day and then two miles back to her home in Little Hulton.

It's taken her 23 months to drop from a size 30 to a size 10 - she's has been to Slimming World in Little Hulton every week since 2011.

Janice has now reached her target weight of 8.5 stone and is a committee member at the club, helping others to lose weight.

Janice has been named Manchester's slimmer of the year and on October 4 she will compete in the UK semi-finals in Derbyshire.
