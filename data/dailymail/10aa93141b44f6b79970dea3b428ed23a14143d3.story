Peter Schmeichel believes Radamel Falcao's move to Manchester United is a shrewd signing by Louis van Gaal.

Colombian forward Falcao joined United on a season-long loan deal from Monaco on transfer deadline day with an option to buy at the end of the 2014-15 campaign.

And Schmeichel thinks it was a good piece of business by Van Gaal as he looks to get United back into the Champions League.

Glory days: Schmeichel with the Champions League

The former United goalkeeper told talkSPORT: 'They didn’t pay a transfer fee for him, it’s a one-year loan deal and they can assess him in that year before they decide whether to buy him or not. If he stays injury free then surely they’ll take the option.

'I think it’s a clever bit a business from the club, he’s a world class player and, while I appreciate the injuries he’s had, don’t forget that much of the build-up to the World Cup was about him.

'People were so excited to see Falcao and Colombia play and so many thought they had a great chance to win the World Cup because of him.

'They ended up doing so well without him, but imagine how far they would have got with him in the team.

'If he can stay injury free for a year he can recuperate and be stronger, and after a successful campaign, if United get back into the Champions League, he can continue from there.'

The Danish goalkeeper spent eight years at Old Trafford between 1991 and 1999, during which he won five Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the Champions League.
