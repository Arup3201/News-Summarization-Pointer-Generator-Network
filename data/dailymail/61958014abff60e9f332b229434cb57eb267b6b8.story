An Iraqi immigrant has been found guilty of bludgeoning his wife to death in their suburban San Diego home, in a case that was initially considered a hate crime.

Kassim Alhimidi, 49, shook his head from side to side as the verdict was read and chaos erupted in the courtroom as another man stood and shouted obscenities.

Alhimidi turned to the man and yelled in Arabic. That man struggled with officers as he was removed.

The judge and the jury also left the courtroom before the hearing could conclude. Alhimidi now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Court bailiffs restrain 49-year-old Kassim Alhimidi after a jury found him guilty of the first degree murder of his 32-year-old wife Shaima Alhimidi as the verdict was announced in a courtroom at El Cajon, California, on Thursday

He was charged with murdering his 32-year-old wife, Shaima Alawadi, in El 
Cajon, home to one of the largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants in the 
U.S.

Prosecutors argued that the 49-year-old 
defendant lied to police about his troubled marriage and apologized to 
his wife as she lay dying in a hospital. Defense lawyers said Alhimidi 
loved his wife.

Investigators initially considered 
the March 2012 killing a hate crime after a note was found near the body
 that read: 'This is my country, go back to yours, you terrorist.'

Alhimidi had wailed during opening statements in court on Tuesday, prompting a judge to briefly halt the proceedings.

No weapon were found in the brutal slaying but prosecutor Kurt Mechals claimed that other evidence proved Alawadi died at the hands of her spouse.

Alhimidi, 49, had pleaded not guilty in the case that evolved from being a suspected hate crime to one about a family that had struggled trying to straddle two cultures.

Mechals told jurors that local and 
federal police initially investigated the bludgeoning as a hate crime 
after a note was found near the body that read: 'This is my country, go 
back to yours, you terrorist.'

However,
 street camera footage and information from the couple's eldest daughter
 about her parents' troubled marriage led police to charge Alhimidi.

Lab tests found the note was a photocopy
 - possibly of a note found outside the family home a week earlier by 
one of the couple's five children.

Detectives also found documents in Alawadi's car indicating she planned to seek a divorce.

Alawadi,
 who wore a headscarf, was found by the couple's daughter Fatima, then 17, in a pool of blood on the 
kitchen floor with her body tangled in a computer cord and desk chair. 
She had multiple skull fractures from blunt force and died two days 
after the attack. A sliding glass door was shattered.

'To this day, we still don't know what the object was,' Mechals told jurors.

However, a medical examiner is expected to testify that it appeared Alawadi was beaten with a tire iron.

Defense
 attorney Douglas Gilliland said the prosecution has no solid evidence 
and instead based its case on interpretations of blood stains on the 
floor, street camera footage tracking Alhimidi's van, and information 
from the couple's daughter, Fatima, who had been at odds with her Muslim
 parents over dating a Christian boy.

Gilliland said no blood or shards of glass from the shattered door were found on Alhimidi.

Gilliland
 pointed out that Alhimidi, who is not fluent in English, has cooperated
 with authorities, even returned early from Iraq, where he buried his 
wife.

He also said Fatima has given conflicting reports, saying at first
 that she saw an intruder and later that she only saw her mother 
bleeding on the floor when she came downstairs.

Mechals
 described Alhimidi as a man who was distraught over his wife's plan to 
leave him and had urged his children and relatives to get her to stay.

After
 the attack, Alhimidi went to the hospital, touched his wife as she lay 
unconscious in bed, and apologized to her, Mechals said.

An uncle of the
 children who was present told authorities that Alhimidi then turned to 
him and said that if his wife woke up, she might try to say that he had 
attacked her.

'If Shaima Alawadi did wake up, she would have said he did this to her, because he did,' Mechals told jurors.

Gilliland countered that the uncle always disliked Alhimidi, and cultural misunderstandings have clouded the truth. The defense lawyer said Muslims often apologize to loved ones who are dying for all the things that they did or didn't do for them in their lives. In U.S. courts, that can be seen as an admission of guilt, he said.

'It doesn't translate,' Gilliland told jurors.

Prosecutors say camera footage indicates that Alhimidi might have driven a short distance from home on the day of the attack and parked his car - contradicting his story to investigators that he had gone for a drive to relax.

The footage shows a person getting out of a parked red car resembling Alhimidi's vehicle around the corner from the home and then walking back to the vehicle an hour later.
