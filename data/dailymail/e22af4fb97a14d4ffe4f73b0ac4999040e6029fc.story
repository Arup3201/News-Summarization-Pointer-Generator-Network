A mother who recruited women outside her children’s school to take part in one of Britain’s biggest ever sham marriage plots was jailed with her partner yesterday.

Andzelina Surmaj befriended the Eastern European women at the school gate before Milan Cina matched them with Nigerian illegal immigrants who paid thousands for a marriage certificate enabling them to stay in Britain.

The couple, who both came to Britain from Eastern Europe, passed only a fraction of the money to the brides, keeping the rest – as much as £26,000 – for themselves.

So far 32 ‘brides’ and ‘grooms’ involved in the scam have been locked up for a total of 33-and-a-half years, with many facing deportation.

Investigators from the UK Border Agency, meanwhile, pieced together evidence against the organisers, including incriminating photographs of them lurking in the background of several ceremonies.

Yesterday Cina, 38, was jailed for five years for organising the weddings, while mother-of-four Surmaj, 30 – who is on the run after failing to attend court – was given three years and eight months.

Judge Beverley Lunt  called the plot ‘a well-organised, commercial enterprise designed to defeat the immigration laws of this country’.

Fake: Surmaj and Cina admitted their part in arranging six sham marriages. But it is thought they could have been involved in around 40 bogus ceremonies in all. Pictured is the parish church of St. Peter in Accrington, where some of marriages occurred

She told Burnley Crown Court Cina had picked churches in Accrington, Lancashire, for many of the weddings because he was counting on lax checks by local vicars. ‘Sadly, you were all too correct,’ she added.

She rejected Surmaj’s claim not to have known the seriousness of the crimes, accusing the pair of ‘callously’ taking advantage of the Eastern European women’s desperation for money.

The pair are thought to have been in Britain for more than a decade. A claim for asylum by Surmaj had been rejected, but she won the right to stay after her native Poland joined the EU.

Cina – Czech-born and the father of the second of her four children – came here 12 years ago. He did occasional work as a handyman, using bogus identities to stay ‘under the radar’ of the authorities.

The pair are suspected of organising 18 sham marriages at four churches in Lancashire and Manchester, although a total of 44 ceremonies have been investigated.

Surmaj, who lived on benefits, befriended Eastern European women as she picked up her children from Whetley Primary School in Bradford. Once she had their trust, she persuaded them to take part in bogus marriages with West Africans in return for between £1,000 and £2,000 – although in reality, many were paid only a fraction of that.

Meanwhile, Cina operated in a shady world where illegal immigrants handed over bundles of cash to fixers who could arrange wedding ceremonies.

By marrying EU citizens, the Africans would win residency in Britain, including the right to work and claim benefits.

The pair arranged transport to the 
churches and dresses for the brides. Clergy were duped with false 
passports and forged utility bills linking the ‘bride and groom’ with a 
fictitious address in  the parish.

In some cases, the pair even arranged ‘marriages’ involving established immigrant couples. For example, Cina found a ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ for Nigerians Omorodian Idehen and his partner Mercy Idehen.

Mercy Idehen’s 2009 marriage to Josef Badzo was witnessed by Badzo’s partner Maria Pretczynska, who had in turn ‘married’ another Nigerian, Lukman Durojaye, in Levenshulme, Manchester, the year before.

Investigators said the resulting tangled web was like ‘the plot of a bad soap opera’.

Cina and Surmaj both pleaded guilty to assisting unlawful immigration. Surmaj also admitted making a false statement by signing a church register and possessing a fake identity card.

Judge Lunt issued a warrant for Surmaj’s arrest.

Legal proceedings to strip the pair of their ill-gotten gains will be held at a later date.
