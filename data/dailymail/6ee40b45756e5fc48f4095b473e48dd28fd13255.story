New York officials plan to amp up security at buildings and bridges after recent climbing stunts at Manhattan's supposedly secure sites surfaced on the internet.

Artist Judith Supine recorded himself climbing the Ed Koch Queensboro bridge at 4 a.m. last Tuesday to showcase a piece of his new street art.

Although his climb was harmless to New Yorker's safety, it showed a major lapse in security that could be potentially dangerous if someone climbed a bridge with malintent.

'It¿s just something I like to do for fun. To be naughty and run around the city and put my art in places I'm not supposed to,' Supine told reporters 

'It’s just something I like to do for 
fun. To be naughty and run around the city and put my art in places I’m 
not supposed to,' he said.

CBS reports that Supine's stunt comes at a time of growing concern about security at New York's landmarks.

Earlier this month, a 16-year-old boy named Justin Casquuejo managed to sneak through a hole in a fence past a security guard at The World Trade Center. He took photos of himself on the tower.

In another incident, men turned themselves into police just last week after a video of them jumping from 1 World Trade center in September was posted on Youtube.They had sneaked past security via a broken fence.

Senator Charles Schumer has ordered the Department of Homeland security to conduct a reveiw of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Safety procedures at The World Trade Center construction site.

'These days you say who else could climb to the top of the Queensboro Bridge for a much more evil purpose? We have to be far more careful with our landmarks, with all of our entryways. Far more careful,' the Schumer said.

Security expert Manny Gomez suggested that more security officers get stationed at landmarks and that there be even more camera security

Even though the Brooklyn Bridge has two police officers stationed at each side at all times, security experts are thinking of building more security.

'It’s very difficult to protect bridges because if you don’t have a dedicated force there, how do you stop someone from randomly climbing a structure in the middle of the night when he/she is unseen?' said security expert Manny Gomez to CBS.

Gomez suggested that more security officers get stationed at landmarks and that there be even more camera security.

Senator Schumer wants to increase security at the Word Trade Center in the wake of the recent security breaches.

'We have to make sure there are no weak links.'

The Port Authority also commented on the matter and said,  'The recent security lapses at the World Trade Center construction site are unacceptable, and the Port Authority and the Durst Organization have taken significant steps to address them.'them.'
