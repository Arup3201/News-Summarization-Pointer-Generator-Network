My former sister-in-law's ideas about bringing up children have never tallied with mine. I won't forget the morning Caroline phoned me in a fury, asking: 'What do you think you were doing with my daughter? She came home with alcohol on her breath. She says you bought her lobster for dinner.'

'I'm her aunt,' I replied defensively. 'I thought it would be good for the growing-up process.'

She refused to be mollified.

Lucky: Petronella's nieces Genevra and Antonella

'But Antonella is just 14,' she shrieked. 'Now she'll want to go to expensive restaurants all the time. What do you think you're doing? It's just too much!'

But of course! Doing too much for our nieces and nephews is what we Panks - a new acronym devised by sociologists meaning Professional Aunts, No Kids - do best.

Just like one in five women in Britain, I've passed the age of 40 without having had children. Combined with the fact that the nuclear family is splitting and reconfiguring itself into a bewildering number of shapes, Panks like me have come into their own.

We are constant, indulgent and have bank accounts that have not been drained by the financial exigencies of bringing up children. Moreover, we have a surplus of free time and maternal love to lavish on nieces and nephews.

Celebrity Panks such as actresses Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, who are both childless, reiterate the mantra of Pank philosophy. Says Miss Diaz, 41, of her three nieces: 'I spoil them rotten. Whatever they want, they get. I cannot resist them.'

It is no wonder we have become a source of irritation to mothers.

Pank: Petronella is a new kind of woman, the Professional Aunt, No Kids

In the universe of Panks, there are good Panks and naughty Panks. Since my two nieces, Genevra and Antonella, were born, I have been regarded by my former sister-in-law as an X‑rated Pank.

My brother Nicholas is much older than myself (I am 42 and he is 60) and when my first niece, Genevra, was born, I was only 18. She and her younger sister Antonella, who was born two years later, tugged at my heart strings from the minute they entered the world.

Then, they were an unconscious substitute for the children yet to be born to me; later, as the years passed, they became a symbol of the children I might not have. Now, they are the closest thing to children I will ever get.

Throughout their lives, in order to win their affection, I have resorted to a tactic that is typical of Panks, and the bane of so many mothers' lives: I have practised shameless one-upmanship.

Nevertheless, I was determined to be the adult female they'd look forward to seeing at family events. While their mother scolded and performed the unpleasant tasks involved in raising children, I was keen to be a cross between a fairy godmother and a three ringed-circus; a never-ending source of fun, gifts, holidays and introductions that would make their peers break out in hives of envy.

It was Pankdemonium. When my nieces were four and six, I bought indoor fireworks to entertain them at Christmas dinner at my then sister-in-law's house in Hammersmith.

The set cost £100. It contained miniature volcanoes, Roman candles, spluttering snakes and exploding bombs.

I shall never forget Caroline's face as the fireworks and their explosive debris did their worst to her recently redecorated dining room. The children and I collapsed in giggles. My sister-in-law, who looked as if she had been turned into granite, pointedly called me a minicab.

After that, family dinners were transferred to my father's larger and more substantial house in North London, where I continued my Pankish ways. When the girls were 11 and 13, I started to shower them with clothing from Chanel.

'And where do you think they are going to wear that?' asked my sister-in-law. Antonella, to my great pride, had just won a place at my alma mater, St Pauls's Girls School in Hammersmith, which had no uniform. 'To school,' I replied blithely. Caroline began to choke.

Celebrity Panks: Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, both childless, endorse the Pank philosophy. Of her three nieces, Diaz says, 'I spoil them rotten'

As the greatest Pank in English literature, Auntie Mame, says in the eponymous novel by Patrick Dennis, which chronicles the adventures of a boy growing up in the care of his eccentric aunt: 'Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death.'

Panks, on the other hand, promise indulgence, largesse - and delicious food. Auntie Mame, who was based on a real-life Pank, gets into trouble with her censorious relatives when she gives her 12-year-old nephew waffles flambéed with champagne while lounging on a chaise longue in a low-cut evening dress. 

I have managed to top even that. I started my nieces on the bubbly when they were about the same age. I would sneak glasses of wine to them when I thought no one was looking.

On the evening of their confirmation (the girls were then 13 and 15), I arrived at the church wearing a figure-hugging catsuit. At the dinner afterwards, in the private room of a sedate restaurant, my nieces, demure in their smart frocks, were encouraged by me to get wildly tipsy. We ended up wrestling on the floor.

I am lucky enough to have a contacts book that includes the names of well-known people. When, a while ago, I told my nieces I was going to have breakfast with the handsome actor Leonardo DiCaprio at the Dorchester Hotel, they begged for signed photographs - which I gleefully provided.

'The coolest Panks are often the maddest Panks.'

I engineered an introduction to musical impressario Andrew Lloyd Webber. Four years ago I interviewed Roger Moore and sneaked my 13-year-old Bond-obsessed godson into the room.

Readers may look askance at these admissions, imagining that I was trying to buy the love I was unable to expend on my own, unborn children.

In part, this has been true. Not having children is an irrevocable sadness. I simply never met the right man at the right time. Though I have been engaged twice, on both occasions I decided not to make the trip to the altar.

So it is fair to say nieces and nephews can become child substitutes - and, in my case, expensive ones at that. According to a global marketing research firm, Panks are spoiling their nieces and nephews to the tune of £6 billion a year, a figure which doesn't surprise me.

One childless girlfriend of mine spent £10,000 in one year taking her 15-year-old niece on luxury holidays to the Maldives, Italy and St Moritz, knowing the child's own mother could not afford expensive vacations abroad. Such was her need to fill the childless void that, during these outings, she encouraged the girl to call her 'Mummy'.

This takes Panking too far. I have never attempted consciously to be a replacement mother to my nieces, or to alienate them from their own.

Grown-up: Genevra (pictured at her graduation) and Antonella have completed their education, but Petronella's antics are still favourite subjects for their anecdotes

While I've loved taking Antonella and Genevra out for lobster dinners after school, or for £20 lychee martinis at trendy new bars, it hasn't always been Pank pranks. I have also given advice on school work, helped them write essays and listened to accounts of their travails with young men, knowing they would speak freely to me in the way they couldn't to their mother.

Children listen to Panks because they are the first grown-ups with whom they become friends.

I have been frank with my nieces about sex, illegal substances and the difficulties young people today face. I have admitted that I once tried cocaine and that I found it a senseless, dangerous experience.

I have told them what I know about the ways of men - and women - which, admittedly, is not very much judging by my chequered personal history. I have told them when I think they are getting too thin or, occasionally, overweight.

But when a Pank criticises, the  sting is softened by humour and a pretence of eccentricity.

Not that my nieces and godchildren believe the latter to be a pretence. For the coolest Panks are often the maddest Panks.

My nieces, now 22 and 24, have completed their education and are starting out in professions. Meanwhile, I continue on my headlong, scenery-chewing, unintentionally hilarious career - a favourite subject for their anecdotes. I'm the living embodiment of a hoot, still dressed in a catsuit with a martini in one hand, a cheque in the other.

Were I ever to become a responsible grown-up in their eyes, I know I'd be toppled from Pankdom. Panks are like Peter Pan: they exist partly in the imagination and must never, ever turn into anything serious.

My former sister-in-law once said to my mother: 'It's amazing how well the girls have turned out, given the influence of your family.'

I like to think it is my Hanky-Pankiness that has contributed a little to their sense of humour, tolerance and generous hearts. I am 'Auntie Petto', and I can think of few more desirable titles - except perhaps that of 'Mummy'.
