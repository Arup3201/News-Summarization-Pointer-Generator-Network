Double killer Peter Keller recorded a chilling video while hiding from police in his remote bunker, explaining that he shot dead his wife and daughter after becoming bored with civilian life.

Survivalist Keller, who later shot himself dead when police hunted him down to his bunker in Washington's Cascade Mountains, said he resorted to a life of fugitive crime because normal civilian life 'freaked him out'.

In a chillingly matter-of-fact two-minute video diary filmed in remote woodland before his death, Keller describes his frustration at 'trying to live, pay bills and go to work'.

Hideout: Peter Keller dug a multi-level bunker near North Bend, Washington stocking it with a generator and ammunition boxes sealed in Ziploc bags

He goes on to claim that 'living out here, robbing banks and pharmacies... at least it'll be exciting.'

Keller gunned down his wife Lynnettee and 18-year-old daughter Kaylene at their home in North Bend, east Seattle, in April.

He then went on the run from police, 
hiding in a fortified, camouflaged bunker in Rattlesnake Ridge, 
Washington, until SWAT teams closed in on him days later.

The 41-year-old then shot himself dead - just as he calmly predicted in his video diary.

Looking down into a handheld camera, 
with his head wreathed by evergreen trees and the blue sky, Keller 
stated flatly: 'If I get caught, I'm just going to shoot myself.

Keller spent eight years carving out his bunker and shot 
himself when authorities tried to smoke him out

Family tragedy: Kaylene Keller, 18, right, and her mother, Lynnettee Keller, 41, left, were both found dead in their bedrooms from gunshots to the head

'I could be dead in two weeks or three weeks, I don't know. It's all up to chance at this point.'

Suicide: Keller is believed to have shot himself at some point during the stand-off with SWAT teams

He added: 'I do have my escape and 
it's death. Shoot myself. I'm OK with that... I won't have to worry 
about Lynnettee or Kaylene. Everything'll be taken care of. It'll just 
be me.'

The King County Sheriff's Office said 
it was releasing the video now because recent forensic tests recently 
proved that one of Keller's guns was used in the murders. There were no 
other suspects.

In a news conference, Sheriff Steve 
Strachan also announced that tens of thousands of dollars was found 
bundled in the bunker, though he declined to specify how much.

When a bomb squad finally blasted its 
way into Keller's fortified bunker in April, they had found the 
fugitive's blood-spattered body lying next to a pistol.

Sgt. Cindi West said evidence found in
Keller's home helped authorities locate the bunker, dug 20 feet into 
the side of a ridge in an area of dense vegetation.

Officers were able to pinpoint the 
location after enhancing a blurry photograph found on a hard drive in an
open safe in Keller's house, she said. The photo included a view from 
the bunker in which buildings in nearby North Bend were visible, along 
with a set of power lines.

Authorities believe that Keller has 
been building the bunker for at least eight years and that he has 
documented the development of the elaborate hideaway with photographs 
dating back to 2004.

He is thought to have been heavily 
armed and well supplied, West confirmed that Keller has brought 'a 
number of rifles, scopes and handguns' as well as a bullet-proof vest.

Lynnettee's family announced that they
would use the money found in Keller's bunker to establish a scholarship
fund in Kaylene's memory ( www.kaylenesfund.com ) for women who attend 
DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, where Kaylene had hoped to 
study video game design.

'The family didn't really find there 
was a problem with Peter,' said Lynnettee's twin brother, Gene Rocha. He
described Keller's relationship with his daughter as loving.

'We'd go there for holidays and it was
like every father-and-daughter relationship,' he said. 'She'd look at 
her father and say, `Daddy, can I have this?' And he'd say, `Sure.''

Tactics: Investigator Nick Halverson looks over a make-shift stove he pulled out from the lower exit of the bunker after Keller spent eight years stocking up his base

Deep underground: A pair of hiking shoes are tucked up next to a ladder and a blood-splattered light switch in the lower level of a multi-level bunker

Ready for action: Keller had stockpiled ammunition in the bunker, which he had worked on since 2004

Lethal haul: Deputies removed a vast assortment of dangerous weapons from the bunker

Unearthed: Deputies found fuel containers in the underground bunker

Bunk: Police say Keller's bunker runs 20-feet deep into the side of a ridge in an area of dense vegetation
