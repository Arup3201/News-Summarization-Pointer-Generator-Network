Action Movie Kid, the 3-year-old whose Dreamworks animator dad put him in some Hollywood's greatest action flicks with his professional grade movie magic, has returned for a sequel.

Using his special effects know-how from work, Daniel Hashimoto created videos that portrayed his son, James, in such classic films as The Matrix, Star Wars and Spider-Man.

Now the father-son team has done it again and this time James is cast in some of everyone's favorite video games. 

Portal: Action movie kid is back with an adorable collection of video game sequences that put James Hashimoto, 3, in the role of hero

Madden: This football video game sequence turns little James into a football superhero

High flying: James's dad turned his little boy into a viral internet star earlier this year when he used his movie magic skills from his job at Dreamworks to put James in the midst of the action

James leaps through floors and walls in a send up of puzzle game Portal, passes a supercharged pigskin in what could be a Madden football spoof and an especially adorable Mario Kart sequence.

If James' magnestism and computer-aided cuteness are any indication, this video is destined to go viral like the original, Action Movie Kid Volume 1.

Takeoff: This installment of Action  Movie Kid has James in the driver's seat of some freewheeling excitement once again

A Mario kart sequence may be the cutest of them all and shows James with his stuffed pal cruising around a sun drenched shopping center

Just like in the classic video games, James shoots a shell to thwart his automotive enemies

Volume 1 has racked up over 2.5 million views since Hashimoto posted it in April.

So what's next for Action Movie Kid?

A third installment is probably not far off, judging from the closing credits:

'Action Movie Kid will return.'

Mr Hashimoto honed his skills on Blockbusters like How to Train Your Dragon and Kung Fu Panda 2, but he says his son prefers games to movies.

'I made them mostly because he is really funny and imaginative,' he told the Daily News. 'James doesn't watch TV or movies very much.'

The cute videos have racked up hundreds of thousands of views in just a few short weeks - some in just days.

'It's humbling and I'm excited that a little hobby I have is enjoyable to other people,' Hashimoto said.
