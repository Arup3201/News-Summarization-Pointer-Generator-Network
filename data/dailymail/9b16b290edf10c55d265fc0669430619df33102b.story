The daughter of the missing AirAsia captain today made an emotional plea for her father to come home, telling him: 'I still need you'.

Captain Iriyanto disappeared in airspace thick with storm clouds between Indonesia and Singapore while piloting Flight 8501 with 162 people on board yesterday.  

His picture was posted on social media by his 22-year-old daughter Angela Ranastianis with the heartbreaking message: 'Papa, please come home, I still need you. Bring back my papa.'

Cpt Iriyanto's father said the last time he saw his son was at the funeral of his other son who died of diabetes last week.

Double tragedy: Cpt Iriyanto's father, Suwarto (above) said the last time he saw his son was at the funeral of his other son who died of diabetes last week

Suwarto, who has only one name, told the BBC he hoped he would see his son again, but accepted it would be God's will if he didn't.

At Iryanto's house in the East Java town of Sidoarjo, neighbours, relatives and friends gathered to pray and recite the Quran to support the distraught family.

Their desperate cries were so loud, they could sometimes be heard outside where three LCD televisions had been set up to monitor search developments.

'He is a good man. That's why people here appointed him as our neighbourhood chief for the last two years,' said Bagianto Djoyonegoro, a friend and neighbour, adding that despite being busy with his job, Iryanto was always very active in the community and attentive to the needs of the people around him.

Cpt Iriyanto's nephew told Indonesian news outlet Detik.com his uncle, who is married with two young children, was 'a very caring person'.

He said: 'He is always helping people because he is a very caring person. If there is a sick relative who needed help and even money, my uncle would be there.

'If there are money problems in the family, he would surely help.'

Many recalled him as an experienced Air Force pilot who flew F-16 fighter jets before becoming a commercial airline pilot. 

AirAsia said the captain had more than 20,000 flying hours, of which 6,100 were with AirAisa on the Airbus 320.

The last communication from the cockpit to air traffic control was a request by one of the pilots to increase altitude from 32,000 feet (9,754 meters) to 38,000 feet (11,582 meters) because of the rough weather. 

Air traffic control was not able to immediately grant the request because another plane was in airspace at 34,000 feet, said Bambang Tjahjono, director of the state-owned company in charge of air-traffic control.

By the time clearance could be given, Flight 8501 had disappeared, Tjahjono said. 

The twin-engine, single-aisle plane, which never sent a distress signal, was last seen on radar four minutes after the last communication from the cockpit. 

Earlier today, an Indonesian official said objects have been spotted in the sea by a search plane hunting for a missing AirAsia jet.

Jakarta's Air Force base commander Rear Marshal Dwi Putranto said he had been informed that an Australian Orion aircraft had detected suspicious objects near Nangka island, about 100 miles (160km) south-west of Pangkalan Bun, near central Kalimantan, or 700 miles (1,120km) from the location where the plane lost contact.

'However, we cannot be sure whether it is part of the missing AirAsia plane,' he said. 'We are now moving in that direction, which is in cloudy conditions.'

AirAsia Flight 8501 carrying 162 people disappeared yesterday in airspace thick with storm clouds on its way from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore.

First Admiral Sigit Setiayana, the Naval Aviation Centre commander at Surabaya air force base, said 12 navy ships, five planes, three helicopters and a number of warships were taking part in the search, along with ships and planes from Singapore and Malaysia.

He said visibility was good: 'God willing, we can find it soon.'

A rescue official said today that, given the route of the plane, he believed the most likely scenario was that it crashed.

'Based on the co-ordinates that we know, the evaluation would be that any estimated crash position is in the sea, and that the hypothesis is the plane is at the bottom of the sea,' National Search and Rescue chief Henry Bambang Soelistyo told a news conference.

The plane's disappearance and suspected crash caps an astonishingly tragic year for air travel in south-east Asia.

The Malaysia-based carrier's loss comes on top of the still-unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over Ukraine. 

The last communication between QZ8501's pilot and air traffic control was when he requested to increase his altitude to 34,000 feet due to bad weather

At the Surabaya airport, passengers' relatives pored over the plane's manifest, crying and embracing.

Nias Adityas, a housewife from Surabaya, was overcome with grief when she found the name of her husband, Nanang Priowidodo, on the list.

The 43-year-old tour agent had been taking a family of four on a trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia's Lombok island, and had been happy to get the work.

'He just told me, 'Praise God, this new year brings a lot of good fortune,'' she recalled, holding her grandson tight while weeping uncontrollably.

Nearly all the passengers and crew are Indonesians, who are frequent visitors to Singapore, particularly on holidays.

The Airbus A320 took off yesterday morning from Indonesia's second-largest city and was about halfway to Singapore when it vanished from radar. The jet had been airborne for about 42 minutes. 

An AirAsia flight - which was an Airbus A320-200 with the registration number PK-AXC (pictured above) - that departed Surabaya early Sunday morning was meant to land at Changi Airport 

There was no distress signal from the twin-engine, single-aisle plane, said Djoko Murjatmodjo, Indonesia's acting director general of transportation.

The last communication between the cockpit and air traffic control was at 6.13am local time (2313 GMT Saturday), when one of the pilots asked to increase altitude from 32,000ft (9,754m) to 38,000ft (11,582m), Mr Murjatmodjo said.

The jet was last seen on radar at 6.16am local time, and was gone a minute later, he told reporters.

Malaysia-based AirAsia has a good safety record and had never lost a plane.

But Malaysia itself has already endured a catastrophic year, with 239 people still missing from Flight 370 and all 298 people aboard Flight 17 killed when it was shot down over rebel-held territory in Ukraine.

AirAsia said Flight 8501 was on its submitted flight plan but had requested a change due to weather.

Sunardi, a forecaster at Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency, said dense storm clouds were detected up to 44,000ft in the area at the time.

'There could have been turbulence, lightning and vertical as well as horizontal strong winds within such clouds,' said Sunardi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
