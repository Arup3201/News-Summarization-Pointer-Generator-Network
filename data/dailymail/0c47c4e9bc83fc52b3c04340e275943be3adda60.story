Antonio Luna has left Aston Villa for Hellas Verona on season-long loan, with the Serie A side having an option to buy the Spanish full-back.

The left-back signed from Sevilla last summer, but failed to make much of an impression in his one year  at the club.

He follows fellow Villains Nicklas Helenius and Yacouba Sylla out of the club on 12-month loan deals.

Option: New signing Kieran Richardson can play in a number of positions including at left-back

Luna's Villa career started well enough, starting and scoring on his debut in the 3-1 win over Arsenal on the first day of last season.

But his form quickly tailed off and he made just 16 more Premier League appearances throughout the rest of the campaign.

Paul Lambert does have cover at left-back, however, with Kieran Richardson signed from Fulham earlier in the summer.
