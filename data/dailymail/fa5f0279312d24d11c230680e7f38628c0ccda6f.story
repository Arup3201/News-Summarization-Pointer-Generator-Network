After a result like that, David Moyes must be thinking, ‘What is going to happen to me here?’ The game against Olympiacos on Wednesday is massive. If they go out, that is United done with Champions League football for 18 months.

Moyes has only made two big signings, but they are not working for him. He spent £27.5million on Marouane Fellaini, but he has never looked a United player. And I’m a big fan of Juan Mata, but you don’t spend £37m on a player and play him out of position.

Frustration: Record £37million signing Juan Mata is being wrongly deployed on the wing

Down and out: The game was yet another nadir for David Moyes' troubled United reign

United have always had fantastic wingers but Mata is not a winger, and you make yourself look worse by playing him there. He needs to play in that No 10 position, but how do you sacrifice a man you’re paying £300,000 a week?

Liverpool had seven British players and thoroughly deserved to win. The way they swarmed over United was amazing. Jordan Henderson was key. He covers so much ground and has added brilliant passing.

Whenever you win a cup or a league, there is normally one moment along 
the way that turns the momentum your way. When you look at Man City’s 
result at Hull, and Chelsea’s at Aston Villa, this weekend could be that
 moment.

I said after City lost to Wigan and went out of the Champions 
League to Barcelona that if they only win the Capital One Cup this 
season that would be failure. But to play with 10 men for 80 minutes and
 win comfortably shows you how good they are.

Missing in action: Misfiring striker Fernando Torres was poor again in Chelsea's loss at Villa Park

As soon as City went down
 to 10 men, there were questions about their mentality. After all the 
travel in midweek, they had a perfect excuse, but they proved a lot of 
people wrong.

Jose Mourinho has made his defence formidable but they 
still lack that one striker up front who can change a game. Fernando 
Torres was poor again and if Eden Hazard doesn’t spark, Chelsea don’t 
have a forward man they can rely on. If they had a Diego Costa they 
would be 10 points clear.

When Liverpool went 1-0 up at United, they went for the throat but it was a different sort of performance from Arsenal at Tottenham.

They showed great resilience and Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker were magnificent at the back. I was critical of Mertesacker when he arrived in the Premier League, but I have to take my hat off to him now.

He is so strong, great in the air and dominates strikers. He’s a proper defender and was crucial in keeping Tottenham at bay. With Chelsea losing and Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City all winning, it was perfect for the title race. What a finale we are in for.

Felix Magath isn’t afraid to throw his youngsters in at the deep end. After making his debut at Cardiff, Cauley Woodrow led the line again for Fulham at Craven Cottage.

The 19-year-old has been on loan at Southend but now he’s started back-to-back league games and probably can’t believe what’s happened to him.

He held the ball up well and did a good job — now he just needs to grab a goal or two. Fulham’s goal difference  is minus 35 and that could prove costly at the end of the season. Nobody wants to go down on goal difference.

It has been a rough few weeks for West Brom but winning at Swansea was a massive result. A few weeks ago the bottom three looked set, but how can you predict it now?

All it takes is one loss and you’re dragged right back into it. It hasn’t worked for West Brom either, sacking Steve Clarke and bringing in Pepe Mel, but it was good to see Stephane Sessegnon back in the goals.

He made a decent start when he arrived from Sunderland and was playing well under Clarke. But he has been hampered by injuries recently, which is a shame because he is the kind of player who can make a difference.

He has pace and links the play well alongside the powerful Victor Anichebe. They are a handful for any defender.

I was pleased to see Jermain Defoe get his Canadian career off to a flyer. The striker scored two goals in seven minutes as Toronto beat Seattle Sounders 2-1.

I don’t think you can be surprised by any transfer deal Tottenham make, but it was a shame to see him leave as he’s still a top  goalscorer. Now the MLS will find out all about his talents.

What a goal from Fabian Delph, and what an important win for Aston Villa. Chelsea will moan about some decisions but Villa played with great determination and thoroughly deserved their win. The performance was driven in that midfield engine room, and that’s no surprise when you look at the manager.

Paul Lambert was a good midfielder and a Champions League winner and is doing a fine job developing his young players, none more so than Delph and his sidekick Ashley Westwood. Westwood doesn’t give the ball away and has got great drive in his game.

Although there was a lot of fuss around Delph at Leeds, he has struggled with injuries. Now he’s showing what he’s capable of. He has scored some great goals this season, but his finish against Chelsea was the best of the lot.

He started the move and finished it with a sublime flick. I was with the maestro Gianfranco Zola in the studio on Saturday and he was hugely impressed. Praise doesn’t come any higher than that.
