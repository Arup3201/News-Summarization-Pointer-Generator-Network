Nick Clegg declared he would 'love to be Prime Minister' - triggering laughter from his own party members while others appeared to fall asleep in the audience.

The Lib Dem leader was challenged at his spring conference in York about why he was not trying to cross the finish line first with an outright majority at the next election, instead of pitching for another coalition.

But he appeared for lost words and snorted at the very idea of voters handing him the keys to Number 10, before laughter broke out in the auditorium.

Clegg then took a moment to take a selfie with a group of Liberal Youth attendees.

Mr Clegg used a question and answer session with party members to defend tuition fees hikes and to attack the Tories over immigration

Mr Clegg used a question and answer 
session with party members to defend hikes to tuition fees, attack the 
Tories over immigration and push for further income tax cuts for low 
paid workers.

But he 
appeared stumped when an activist asked him: 'Can we please campaign to 
form the next government alone. Under first-past-the-post nobody can 
vote for a coalition.'

Mr Clegg struggled for an answer, telling the conference hall at the York Barbican: 'I would love to be Prime Minister...'

But he was drowned out by applause and laughter from the party faithful.

The deputy prime minister also called for further income tax cuts for low paid workers in his speech

Mr Clegg pushed his pro-EU message - which dominated the conference ahead of Brussels elections in May

He
 went on: 'I want us to campaign for Lib Dem policies, values and people
 in government. I don't go around campaigning for this coalition or that
 coalition.'

And in 
apparent admission that the Lib Dems' only hope of power is a 
power-sharing deal with Labour or the Tories, he added: 'I just so 
happen to think that most people realise that the way to get Lib Dem 
policies, values and people into government...

'...Right now is going to be 
done in power with another party.'

Mr Clegg said Labour assumed 'government will drop into their lap' in the next elections

He repeatedly pushed his pro-EU message, which has dominated the conference ahead of Brussels elections in May.

But
 minutes earlier councillor Jill Hope told the Lib Dem leader that the 
party's conference: 'The theme for this conference is "in Europe in 
work", but no-one on the doorstep cares'.

Turning his fire on the Tories, Mr 
Clegg launched an outspoken attack on Immigration Minister James 
Brokenshire, who used a speech this week to accuse a 'wealthy 
metropolitan elite' of enjoying cheap tradesman and services.

The speech triggered a major coalition row, with Mr Clegg, David Cameron and Theresa May employ foreign nannies and cleaners.

Mr Clegg said: 'Over the last 24 to 48 hours we have seen in many respect some of the most ugly sides of the immigration debate.

'It
 is truly dispiriting to see the Conservative and Labour parties, the 
two largest parties in British politics, driven, as far as I can see, 
entirely by panic on this issues.

Clegg's selfie at the spring conference is the latest in a stream of the self portraits taken by political figures.

British
 Prime Minister David Cameron caused outrage when he, US president 
Barack Obama and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt posed for a
 selfie at Nelson Mandela's memorial service.

This week, Cameron caused a Twitter stir by posting a picture of himself on the telephone to US president Barack Obama.

Star
 Trek actor Patrick Stewart was one of the first to mock the rather 
embarrassing image - posting an image of himself with a packet of Wet 
Ones to his ear along with the caption - 'I'm now patched in as well - 
sorry for the delay.'

'You
 have got a Conservative Party which is no longer standing up for 
business - quite a big development, that. I think, personally they do so
 at their peril. The Institute of Directors absolutely slammed the 
irresponsible speech made by a Conservative minister this last week on 
immigration.

'And yet the 
Labour Party who won't stand up against xenophobia. Instead of trying to
 actually reduce the temperature of the debate they try and stoke it.'

Mr
 Clegg, whose hopes of remaining in power after 2015 depend on another 
coalition, attacked both Labour and the Tories over reports suggesting 
they could rule out any power-sharing deal in the event of a hung 
parliament.

Reports
 suggest that David Cameron is privately considering ruling out a 
coalition and promising to rule at the head of a minority administration
 if the Conservatives fail to secure an overall majority, and Unite 
general secretary Len McCluskey has also reportedly suggested that 
Labour should go it alone even if they fail to win the most seats.

Mr Clegg said there was an assumption within Labour that 'government will drop into their lap' and they did not need to work for it.

'I have found it very striking to see this McCluskeyite tendency in both the Labour and Conservative Party who are now going one step further and saying 'even if we don't have a majority, we will govern Britain', which overlooks the slightly old-fashioned democratic principle that you have to win a majority before you have a right to say you will govern Britain.

'All of this just reveals a really unpleasant mix of arrogance and cowardice on the part of the two main parties, the two larger parties in British politics.'
