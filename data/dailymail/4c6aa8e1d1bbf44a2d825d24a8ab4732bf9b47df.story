Tragedy: An inquest has been launched into the passing of Shayla Walmsley, 44, examining whether her death could have been caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump

The catchphrase ‘In better control .  .  .’ appears again and again on the Medtronic website.

It  is the pharmaceutical company’s clever marketing strategy to promote their insulin pumps – medical devices often thought of as a foolproof alternative to the daily injections of lifesaving drugs needed by diabetics.

Yet last week, an inquest was launched into the death in her  sleep of financial journalist Shayla Walmsley, 44, with the family’s legal team examining whether it could have been caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump.

A year before, a 26-year-old woman, known only as Ffion as she wishes  to remain anonymous, claims to have suffered a massive overdose after her pump released a large amount of the drug insulin into her bloodstream.

She spent two days on a life support machine and lay in an induced coma for a further two days, but has since recovered fully.

In
 May, a week after Shayla’s  body was found, the Medicine and Healthcare
 Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) watchdog sent out a warning regarding
 the device after the manufacturer discovered some to be faulty.

Problems
 identified included mechanical faults that could result in too much 
insulin being released – a potentially life-threatening overdose – by 
accident.

Medtronic,
 who make the MiniMed Paradigm pumps, one of the most popular brands – 
models of which were used by both women – say their products were not at
 fault in Ffion’s case.

They tested her pump and found it to be fully 
functional. Human error is a known cause of overdose with all methods of
 taking insulin.

The cause 
of Shayla’s death is yet to be determined by the coroner. But lawyer 
Mark Harvey, who is representing both the Walmsley family and Ffion, 
says known problems may predate these incidents.

On
 April 2 this year, Medtronic sent an ‘urgent recall’ letter to all  
Australian users of MiniMed Paradigm pumps, warning them that 
malfunctions with the device might lead to overdose.

In July, US regulators the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) followed suit after Medtronic admitted similar
 faults with the devices there. ‘Severe illness’ resulting  from 
overdose was highlighted as a potential risk.

Under investigation: Shayla was using a programmable insulin pump administering it continuously through a catheter into her body

Warnings
 are usually triggered when doctors or, more rarely, patients report 
back to manufacturers, or directly to the relevant regulators, that they
 are having problems with a device.

Harvey
 is concerned by the delay in issuing a UK warning and the fact that it 
was not an urgent recall as had happened in Australia a month before. 
‘We are worried that British patients may still not be aware of serious 
issues with these devices.’

People
 with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin of their own, 
which is a problem because insulin controls the body’s absorption of 
sugars, or glucose. This  leads to dangerously high levels in the blood.
 Synthetic insulin is taken to control this problem.

Insulin pumps are portable devices, about the size of a pack of cards, which stay connected to the body and deliver insulin from a reservoir via a cannula (tube) placed under the skin.

They are programmable, allowing the user to modify the amount of drug they receive at any given time, which could be while sleeping. There are currently about three million diabetics in Britain, with ten per cent of those diagnosed with the type 1 form.

In type 2 diabetes, the most common form, the condition is often controllable – and even reversible – with diet and tablets. For those with type 1, injections of insulin are the only treatment option.

Typically, one daily injection provides a slow-acting background level of insulin, with additional fast-acting doses given with a separate injection ‘pen’ before or after eating or drinking.

Before: A traditional insulin pen

The major problem with the treatment is the risk of hypoglycaemia (very low blood-sugar levels) if too much of the drug is taken.

Often called ‘a hypo’, typically patients experience shakes, sweating, hunger, palpitations and mood swings due  to not enough glucose being available for use by cells throughout  the body.

This is unpleasant but can usually be corrected by consuming a high-sugar food, such as a glucose tablet, fruit juice or sweets. But if blood-sugar drops for a longer period or sharply, patients can lose consciousness. This is considered a medical emergency, as the condition can be fatal. Just a few too many units of insulin given at any one time can be enough to trigger an episode.

Insulin pumps eliminate the need for multiple jabs and, according  to studies put forward by manufacturers, also reduce the likelihood of hypos.

Children – who may forget or misjudge amounts to inject – as well  as those who are very active or lead erratic lives, meaning they miss meals, and those with extremely difficult-to-control diabetes are usually considered candidates for  a pump.

According to diabetes.co.uk, six per cent of adults and 19 per cent  of children with type 1 diabetes  use one. However, they are not foolproof. The FDA has reported 17,000 cases of health problems linked to insulin pumps made by manufacturers including Medtronic, MiniMed, Roche and Johnson & Johnson, all of which distribute in the UK. In some cases human error is to blame, but just how many incidents are related to mechanical faults is unclear.

Ffion suffered an overdose of insulin in May 2012 after her pump released insulin into her bloodstream while she slept. She suffered convulsions which woke her boyfriend, who called an ambulance.

Ffion initially sent her pump back to Medtronic for analysis. They wrote to her in April this year claiming there were ‘no anomalies’ with the device. She says: ‘Essentially, this implied it was my fault, not theirs. It made me very, very angry. If I had been sleeping alone, I wouldn’t be here now.’

Harvey, a partner at Hugh James solicitors, adds: ‘Their letter to Ffion fails to flag up the known problems in other countries. It was only after our own investigations that these malfunctions came to light. It seems strange that they did not mention the Australian urgent recall that happened in the same month.’

A spokesman for Medtronic said: ‘Patient safety is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring  high-quality standards of manufactured products to support them in their daily diabetes management.

‘Every day hundreds of thousands of customers use the Paradigm system in order to seek better control in their diabetes management.

‘We have not been contacted by any investigating authority or had the opportunity to examine the insulin pump Ms Walmsley used. Due to this and to patient confidentiality, we are unable to comment on the circumstances that led to Ms Walmsley’s death.’

A spokesman for the MHRA  said: ‘Our priority is to ensure that patients have acceptably safe  medical devices and we take prompt action to address any safety or performance concerns.’

Shayla’s older brother Stephen Walmsley is not reassured. He says: ‘If Shayla’s death was caused by a failing pump, the manufacturers need to take them off the market  to ensure no other family ever  has to go through the pain and misery that we are suffering.’
