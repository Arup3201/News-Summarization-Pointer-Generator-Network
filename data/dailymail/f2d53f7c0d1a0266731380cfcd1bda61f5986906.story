The parents of a four-year-old boy who was killed in a notorious unsolved murder nearly 30 years ago are furious after a picture of their son was used in a festival advertisement.

The face of French boy Gregory Villemin was splashed across a poster advertising nursery services at the Montreux Jazz Festival, in Switzerland.

The little boy was murdered in 1984 after a series of threatening phone calls to the parents. His body was found in the Vologne river near Docelles, in eastern France, close the to family's home, in October 1984.

The face of Grégory Villemin, who was murdered in 1984, was used on an advert for nursery services at a Swiss Jazz Festival. His parents are considering suing

For decades, the ongoing case to solve the murder has seen twists and turns reported in the media.

But, according to the organisers of the Swiss festival, a young employee there had no idea the picture taken for the kindergarten advert was that of murdered Gregory Villemin.

According to English language news service, The Local, the parents are now considering suing the festival company.

Thierry Moser, a lawyer for Gregory's parents Christine and Jean-Marie Villemin, is quoted on TV station France 3 Lorrainen, saying: 'We intend to sue for compensation for the damage that has been caused,' the Local said.

The parents have received a letter of apology which 'has made a good impression,' but they are considering legal action nonetheless.

Mathieu Jaton, managing director of the jazz festival, was contacted by Le Huffington Post, the French language online arm of the U.S. news service.

The news site said the festival organisers noticed the error too late, and the printed adverts had already been published. The image was pulled down from the online ad, however.

Despite the explanation, and the letter of apology, Gregory's parents have reportedly rejected the reason.

Mr Moser told The Local the excuse was 'pitiful', 'absolutely inexcusable' and the parents believe it was a 'stunt' arranged by the festival organisers.

From 1980-84, parents Christine and Jean-Marie Villemin had been plagued by threatening anonymous phonecalls.

Then on October 16 1984 they received a chilling call informing them 'I have taken the boy'.

A massive police search discovered Gregory's body seven kilometres from their home, face down in the Volgne river.

The next day after, an anonymous letter arrived addressed Jean-Marie, which read: 'I hope you die of grief, boss. Your money can’t give you back your son. Here is my revenge, you stupid bastard.'

Voice experts have been unable to identify who made the recorded calls.

There have been many DNA tests, on saliva traces on the letter stamp and, later, tests on Gregory's clothes have been inconclusive.

Bernard Laroche, Jean-Marie Villemin's cousin, was the main suspect, after his 15-year-old sister-in-law told police there was circumstantial proof he had murdered Grégory.

But she later recanted and a judge in 1985 freed Laroche

The same day, a furious Jean-Marie Villemin vowed, in front of journalists, that he would kill his cousin.

True to his word, he shot and killed Laroche a month later.

In 1993, Villemin was sentenced to five years prison for the killing.

Mrs Villemin was also suspected because she was seen in the post office the day of the murder and there was cord identical to that used to tie Gregory found at the home.

But in 1985 a judge made a rare ruling forbidding her prosecution.

Further DNA tests, even up until last year, have continued to raise hopes of finding the killer.

But the case remains unresolved.
