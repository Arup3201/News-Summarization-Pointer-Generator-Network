The true number of jobs in danger from the collapse of parcel delivery firm City Link could top 3,700 – 1,000 more than previously feared.

Bosses at the troubled firm were branded ‘cowards’ after workers only discovered their jobs were at risk via news reports on Christmas Day revealing the business had gone into administration.

The company employs 2,727 people and said they had been paid until the end of this month. Substantial redundancies are imminent.

However, it emerged yesterday that the livelihoods of a further 1,000 contractors not directly employed by City Link, but who work for the firm as self-employed drivers or agency support staff, are also under threat.

They will be treated as ‘unsecured creditors’ by administrators and are unlikely to receive any further salaries owed until all creditor claims have been assessed.

One creditor claimed that he was owed almost £300,000, but administrators said he would be ‘lucky’ to get a penny for every pound owed.

City Link went into administration on Christmas Eve and customers waiting for deliveries must now collect orders from depots next week.

Its online parcel tracking system remains available, and a phone helpline will be open today and on Monday. Customers have been asked to pick up their parcels as soon as possible after depots re-open on Monday.

The firm had been delivering 60million parcels a year for several High Street chains. John Lewis has transferred all its business to other carriers following its collapse.

Unions demanded an urgent meeting with Business Secretary Vince Cable and said it was an ‘absolute disgrace’ staff had learned their jobs were in jeopardy on Christmas Day.

Worker Mark Critchley discovered via his union, not from his managers, he faced redundancy. Staff who had discussed rumours the firm was in trouble were threatened with disciplinary action by managers, he said.

Outside the firm’s main base in Coventry, he told Sky News: ‘We would like them to come down here and man up and tell us what’s going on and why they have done it… They’re all very cowardly men who will not face the music.’

Mr Cable said the firm’s collapse was a bitter blow to the workforce, adding he would happily meet the union in the New Year.’

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said employees ‘worked their socks off’ for Christmas, only to learn a day later that their jobs were in danger.

He questioned whether the firm had fallen prey to ‘classic asset stripping’ after it was sold to venture capitalists Better Capital, owned by Tory donor Jon Moulton, for just £1 last year by Rentokil.

Administrators EY were appointed after close of business on Christmas Eve. Responding to the RMT’s claim of ‘asset stripping’, an EY spokesman said Better Capital invested £40million in City Link and had not received any return on its investment.

The private equity group is one of the firm’s ‘secured creditors’, meaning it will get a priority ranking in any distribution from the realisation of City Link’s asset, EY said.

In a leaked internal email from City Link’s chief executive Dave Smith, he told staff: ‘With the business still incurring losses the company was faced with the situation of imminently running out of cash.’

The firm had made a loss since 2007, and Rentokil had written off millions when it owned the company.

Better Capital said it could not comment further while the stock market remains closed.
