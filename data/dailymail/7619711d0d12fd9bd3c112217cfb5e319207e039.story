As hundreds of soldiers prepared to take to the field clutching spears and swords, it was perhaps no surprise that health and safety bosses might have something to say.

But it was the rain, rather than the weapons, that meant a re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings was cancelled yesterday.

Some 1,066 people dressed as Norman and Saxon warriors were expected to stage their own version of the famous battle at what is thought to be the original site in Sussex. But history fans were left disappointed after heavy downpours on Saturday meant organiser English Heritage was forced to cancel the event for ‘safety reasons’.

Fog of war: One thousand and sixty six Saxon and Norman soldiers from re-enactment groups across Europe aimed to faithfully recreate the Battle of Hastings in 1066

A spokesman for English Heritage said: ‘Although the forecast was for fair weather over this weekend, unexpected torrential rain over several hours this morning has resulted in unacceptably high levels of mud both on the battlefield and on public areas. For safety reasons, the event cannot go ahead.’

Kevin Boorman, of Hastings Borough Council, said: ‘It is understandable but it is a real shame because the organisers put a lot of time and money into organising and advertising it.’

The council had held a week-long festival of events, culminating in the re-enactment weekend, since the battle’s 900th anniversary in 1966.

While the battle was cancelled, events on Saturday including a town criers’ contest and firework display, went ahead.

The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14 1066 between the Norman-French army of Duke William II of Normandy and the English army under King Harold II.

Harold II was killed - legend has it that he was shot in the eye with an arrow - and was the last English king to die in battle on English soil until Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field. The battle was a decisive victory for William, who became England's first Norman ruler.

Echoes of history: Re-enactors strive to be as historically accurate as possible, even down to the food they eat

Cosy: A soldier takes a break. Even accommodation is as authentic as possible

Stoic: Like their real-life counterparts, the re-enactors have to lug their heavy weapons and armour around the battlefield

The battle is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, which also chronicled the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England.

An abbey was built on the site of the battle after Pope Alexander II ordered the Normans to do penance for killing so many people during their occupation.

Camp: Soldiers travelled with cooks, armourers and a host of other supporters

Feeding time: Even young history enthusiasts can get in on the action at the annual event

Downfall: Participants take shelter from the downpour. Torrential rain forced organisers to cancel the battle re-enactment

Prepared: The chain mail armour the soldiers wear is roughly 10kg. The armour was expensive to produce and often looted in the aftermath of a battle
