Saved: Lesley Hastings, 53, told yesterday how her dog Maisy nearly died after eating poisoned chicken

A suspected pet poisoner is being hunted by police after three dogs died from eating toxic meat planted in parks. 

The pets were found to have eaten chunks of chicken and fish smothered in a banned insecticide, while at least three other dogs have been left fighting for their lives after coming into contact with the meat.

The poisoner used highly toxic Methomyl. Less than one gram of it is enough to kill a toddler, and just handling it can make an adult seriously ill.

Touching the infected meat could have caused nausea, heart irregularities, dizziness, muscle tremors and cramps in adults or death if left untreated.

At least six animals have been poisoned in or near Fryent Country Park in Brent, north-west London in the last few months. 

Detectives are also investigating whether there are any links to suspected poisonings in Hampstead Heath, where another five dogs fell ill last week.

A bull lurcher killed in the first attack in January ate what was described as blue tablets inside Fryent Park.

Last month another bull lurcher was killed after it ate meat smeared in a blue paste left on a grass verge just outside the southern entrance to the park.

Owner Lesley Hastings, 53, told yesterday how she had been left distraught by the loss of pet Toby in the attack, which almost killed another of her dogs, Maisy, a shih tzu-jack russell cross.

The casino worker was walking her dogs when she saw Maisy eat a piece of chicken lying under a tree at the side of the road.

Tragic: Ms Hastings took an agitated Maisy (left) to the vet after she saw her eat a piece of chicken lying under a tree. She later returned home to find her other dog Toby (right) - who had also eaten some of the meat - dead

Unaware of the risk to her own health, she attempted to yank it out of her dog’s mouth – but did not realise Toby had also eaten it.  

She said: ‘I managed to get the food out Maisy’s mouth. By the time we got back home she was very agitated and shaking.

'Another dog had been poisoned a few months ago so I put her straight in the car and took her to the vet. When I returned home half an hour later Toby was dead. I was heartbroken. I don’t have kids so it’s like losing a family member.’

Rescued: Pauline Morris (left) managed to save her cocker spaniel Bella after rushing her to the vets. Less than one gram of Methomyl (right) is enough to kill a toddler, and just handling it can make an adult seriously ill

The next day a springer spaniel died and another dog fell ill after ingesting the poison planted in undergrowth on the same road.

Pauline Morris managed to save her cocker spaniel Bella after rushing her to the vets. 

She said: ‘It happened really quickly. Within minutes she was shaking violently. 

‘When we took her to the vets we didn’t know if we’d see her again. My three daughters and three grandchildren love her. It’s such an easy thing to do and it is so dangerous. Imagine if a child in the park picked it up?’

Ongoing: At least six animals have been poisoned in or near Fryent Park (pictured) in the last few months

Motive: Police suspect the culprit may have a grudge against owners who leave dog mess lying around or they may have intended to target foxes in the area. Above, another section of the park in Brent

Police suspect the culprit may have a grudge against owners who leave dog mess lying around or they may have intended to target foxes in the area.

Sergeant Peter Rowntree of the Metropolitan Police said: ‘This is such a nasty, cruel act. I have been a wildlife crime officer for nine years and I have never seen anything like this.’

Animal rights charity PETA is offering a £1,000 reward for information that could lead to the capture of the poisoner.

Sad: Ms Hastings, pictured with her dog Maisy, said she was 'heartbroken' when her other pet, Toby, died
