Former Manchester United manager David Moyes rates Adnan Januzaj alongside Wayne Rooney as the best young talent he has ever seen.

The 51-year-old Scot gave the Belgian teenager his competitive debut during his ill-fated tenure at Old Trafford and sees similarities with how he brought Rooney through the youth ranks at former club Everton.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Moyes said: 'Adnan Januzaj is, in my managerial time, the best young talent up there with Wayne Rooney. You can see what he can become. When we had Wayne at Everton you could see the potential.

'Adnan Januzaj has got all that at the same age as Wayne. He's one of the best young talents in Europe and he will go on to become one of the best players.

Moyes also revealed that he intended to use the 19-year-old on the wing and likened his style of play to former England provider Chris Waddle.

He added: 'He had a bit of Chris Waddle about him. Waddle used to slow you down and make you feel comfortable and before you knew it he was gone. Adnan has that. He can eliminate people. 

'Wayne was different but in the same way as we saw something special in him at Everton we saw that in Adnan Januzaj. I can only see the boy going right to the top.'
