A handcuffed man stole a police SUV in Southern California and sped away, forcing officers to commandeer a tow-truck and pursue him at high speed for 10 miles, authorities have said.

The suspect crashed the California Highway Patrol (CHP) cruiser in the woods in the Fallbrook area and hid 'in a bush' for an hour-and-a-half before being recaptured, Channel 10 News reported.

When Aaron Teruya, 25, was found, he was still wearing handcuffs. He faces charges driving under the influence, stealing a vehicle and resisting arrest.

Busted: Aaron Teruya, 25, told reporters, 'I was just being stupid and I didn't want to go to jail'

You're nicked: the police SUV was found in the woods. Teruya was found in a bush, an hour-and-a-half later

CHP Officer Jim Bettencourt told U-T San Diego that police were first alerted when Teruya, of San Diego, was spotted driving his 2000 Ford Focus 'at high rate of speed and weaving in and out of traffic' on Interstate 15 south of Temecula. 

Teruya hit a truck towing a trailer and was apprehended by police. He was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. 

The suspect was handcuffed and put in the front seat of a police SUV, while a tow-truck was called to remove his 2000 Ford Focus.

While the officer was talking to the tow-truck's driver, Teruya pulled the handcuffs up around his legs, got behind the wheel of the patrol car and sped away, Bettencourt said.

The arresting officer got into the tow truck and  chased his own patrol car for 10 miles along the freeway. 

Teruya steered the police SUV onto westbound state Route 76, then turned off onto a dirt road near Gird Road. He then crashed into a large rock, left the vehicle and and ran into the woods where he hid for an hour-and-a-half. 

According to U-T San Diego, additional deputies from Riverside and San Diego counties and canine units were scrambled to join the manhunt.

Eventually, Teruya was located and taken back into custody. 

He was transferred to the Southwest Detention Center in Riverside County, where he faces charges including driving under the influence, stealing a vehicle and resisting arrest.

'I put the cuffs in front of me, and I got in front, put it in gear, and the next thing I knew I was driving,' Teruya told Channel 10 News as he was being led away.

'I was just being stupid and I didn't want to go to jail, that's pretty much it.'

When asked how he felt while hiding in the bush, Teruya said: 'I was scared.'

Brazen: on Facebook, Teruya suggested that people should 'live life knowing you truely (sic) have no regrets'

Scene of the crime: the section of Interstate 15 south of Temecula, California, where the chase unfolded

The journalist who interviewed him on camera, Dan Haggerty of Channel 10, expressed his amazement that Teruya 'spilled his guts' to the media while being led to jail.

'To say I was surprised that this guy stopped and spilled his guts for our camera while being taken to jail would be an understatement,' he said.

'Then again, he did steal a CHP cruiser, crash it in these woods in Fallbrook, and hide in a bush for an hour-and-a-half before being re-arrested.

'Clearly he wasn't having a day of good decision making.'
