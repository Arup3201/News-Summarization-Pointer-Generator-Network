An Avon Lady and her husband who quit their jobs and started selling cosmetics to pay off their debts are now living a luxury lifestyle with an income of £125,000-a-year.

Nadine Rowlands, 44, first started selling Avon make-up to her friends and family as a means to pay off her £30,000 debts.

However, after leaving her role as a legal secretary to sell the firm's cosmetics full-time, and convincing her husband Wayne to do the same, she is now Avon's top saleswoman with the pair earning almost as much as the Prime Minister.

A pretty penny: After quitting their jobs to work for Avon, husband and wife Wayne and Nadine Rowlands make £125,000-a-year and have bought this Jaguar XK - complete with personalised number plate

When Mrs Rowlands, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, started selling door-to-door in 1996 she could not even afford to buy the products she was selling.

She and Mr Rowlands, 54, were living in as cramped rented attic room, and struggling to pay off debts, let alone save enough money for a deposit on a house.

However, Mrs Rowlands decided her only option was to throw everything into her new business venture, quitting her £20,000-a-year job at a law firm eight years ago so she could commit all her time to selling for Avon.

Avon Calling: Mrs Rowlands is now the company's top saleswoman, but says she still enjoys visiting customers door-to-door

She said: 'I was clutching at straws, and we were really desperate to pay off our debt and be able to afford a deposit to buy our own house.

'The first few months were tough, but I knew in my gut I was going to be successful.

'I was earning about £20,000 a year as a legal secretary, and Wayne about £28,000 as an engineer - but we really threw everything into the business.

'Our family and friends thought we were mad.

'Secretly I think they were worried that everything was going to come crashing down again, but we knew it was the right thing to do and we took a leap of faith.'

Her decision paid off, and now the award-winning sales leader, manages 1700 representatives across the UK, although she still enjoys visiting customers door-to-door.

Through working for Avon, Mr and Mrs Rowlands have paid for an extension to their home, bought a Jaguar XK, complete with registration plate 'AV04 REP' and go on regular holidays abroad, including to the Algarve in Portugal.

Mrs Rowlands success story mirrors that of a fellow Avon rep, Jeanette Stewart, 34, from County Durham, who now has an annual turnover of £1million, after taking up selling make-up to pay of a credit card debt of £60,000.

Single mother Gail Reynolds, another Avon Lady, built a £5.5million empire through selling cosmetics in her hometown of Weymouth, Dorset, while Rebekah Testar, from Burbage Leicestershire, has sold more than £4million worth of make-up.

Self-confessed workaholic Mrs Rowlands says that the healthy bank balance comes does come at a price and says she still works until 11pm most evenings.

She said said: 'Before I started Avon, I hadn’t been on an holiday abroad for more than 14 years.

'But now, it’s not uncommon for me to be lying on the beach with a cocktail answering my work emails.

Team effort: Mr and Mrs Rowlands were living in a cramped rented attic room when they started selling products for the cosmetics firm, only to become two of Avon's most successful sales reps

'When I used to work full time and do Avon in my spare time, many of nights would I spend knocking doors, talking to people and I saw them as my friends not just customers.

'Not a lot has changed, I still do my rounds but extra duties like training other budding representatives also fall under my sales leader role, and I embrace every new challenge that comes my way.

'Some people ask us how we’ve done it and want a slice of the high life, but the truth is me and Wayne have worked hard to get where we are now, it didn’t just happen overnight and I wouldn’t have it any other way.'

Rewards: Through selling door-to-door the couple have funded an extension for their home in Greater Manchester and regularly jet off to destinations such as Monte Carlo, pictured
