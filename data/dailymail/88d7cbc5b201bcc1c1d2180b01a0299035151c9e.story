Rail scam: Dr Peter Barnett (pictured outside court) faces jail after admitting to six counts of fraud by false representation 

An international lawyer faces ruin after admitting dodging more than £23,000 in rail fares.

Dr Peter Barnett, 43, was told he could be jailed after police discovered he spent more than two and a half years cheating the system.

He gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an Oxfordshire market town to London’s Marylebone station.

Investigators discovered the Oxford graduate and Rhodes scholar regularly pretended to have travelled from Wembley instead to save himself huge sums.

The Australian-born lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children’s charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at ‘promoting prosperity’.

On Friday, he pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates’ Court to six counts of fraud by false representation, carrying a maximum penalty of ten years in jail. 

The deception places him among the ranks of Britain’s biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. 

Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex.

The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. He claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home.

Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor.

When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found that the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012.

It is understood that he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket. He then got off at Marylebone, tapping out with an Oyster card. 

Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently £7.60. But this is still far less than the £19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home.

It was the same ruse employed by Burrows, who was caught out when his train company realised he had not bought a season ticket since 2008. 

Barnett’s train operator, Chiltern Railways, claims he now owes them more than £23,000, which he has agreed to pay back.

On Friday, prosecutor Zahid Hussain told the court: ‘Clearly, the distance between Wembley and Marylebone, where he was working, is far less than to his true home of Oxfordshire, and as such he has gained financially.

‘The financial loss to Chiltern Railways because of his fraudulent conduct is in excess of £23,000.’ 

He said Barnett had also ‘altered a photo-card to avoid detection’, adding: ‘It was planned. It was premeditated.’

Barnett is the author of a book on international law and worked for a major London law firm before becoming a senior figure at Gerson Lehrman Group, an investment fund consultancy. The New York-based company said he left three years ago.

He blamed ‘family problems’ for his behaviour and his lawyer said he showed ‘genuine remorse’. Saul Herman, defending, said the loss to the railway company was ‘much closer on my calculation to £7,500’ and asked for the figure to be reviewed.

But he said his client was in a position to pay back all the cash, saying ‘a means form has been completed which shows compensation can be paid in the full amount’.

Barnett was released on unconditional bail while a further assessment of how much he owes is made. He will be sentenced next month.

Following publication of this article, solicitors representing Jonathan Burrows have contacted us to say that while £43,000 was paid to Southeastern trains to settle the matter out of court, this sum does not reflect the value of the unpaid fares alone, which could be measured in hundreds rather than thousands of pounds.
