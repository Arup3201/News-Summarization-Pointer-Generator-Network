A 27-year-old woman in Broward County, Florida has filmed herself berating Dunkin' Donuts employees in an apparent attempt to exact some kind of consumer justice.

Taylor Chapman, however, only succeeds in appearing rude, ignorant and racist in the video, which she posted on her Facebook page.

The imagined slight occurred the night prior, when a Dunkin' Donuts employee apparently forgot to print Chapman's receipt. In what Chapman seems to have construed as a mortal insult, the employee offered Chapman her entire order free the next time she entered the store to make up for the oversight.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Viral: Before making her obscene Dunkin' Donuts video, Chapman's YouTube channel was devoted to marketing videos, including this one for Happy Wok

Poor worker: This Dunkin' Donuts employee gracefully puts up with Chapman's demands and insults

This more than generous offer apparently boiled Chapman's blood, and she entered the fast food outlet the next day armed with a camera phone and a bad attitude.

To the credit of Dunkin' Donuts staff, they are unfailingly polite to Chapman, despite the insults, swearing and racial slurs spat at them.

In between orders of bacon and cheese croissants (bacon extra crispy), iced coffee with extra cream and extra sugar and a Strawberry Coolatta, which Chapman mistakenly thinks the workers have forgotten.

The eight minute and nine second ordeal begins with Chapman warning the male employee who serves her, 'This is all being under video surveillance, OK?'

She then tells him her complaint: That a female employee the night before forgot to print out her receipt and then 'turned into a complete rude b*tch'.

She neglects to explain exactly how the employee did her wrong though. 'She told me, OK, you can get your order free next time. So you know what I told her? I want the whole f****n' menu, b***h. Twice.'

Butter wouldn't melt: From the way Chapman interviews business owners on her YouTube channel, you'd never guess she'd racially abuse fast food workers because of a forgotten receipt

According to Chapman, her lawyer is 'already on it' and she says she'd spoken to someone from the store earlier that day who told her she could have her order free.

The employee explains that he doesn't know what happened the night before but reassures Chapman he's happy to give her what she wants.

She begins to order, asking for the Strawberry Coolatta, which she admits was not one of the items she ordered the day before.

Chapman tells a fellow customer, 'I just want my bacon crispy and my people nice, you know?'

'Cos I literally thought this was the best one in the city, and I gave you guys so many good, like, remarks online because I have a business degree and, like, I really did until that b***h just completely p****d me off,' she explains, reasonably.

Chapman attempts to engage her fellow customers in the video, but they aren't forthcoming.

'That's your issue,' says one man. 'I've got my own issues.' A receipt ain't one, though, as he tells Chapman that he is always given his receipt at Dunkin' Donuts.

First world problems: 'This is what you have to do in life, it f*****g sucks. Blow my brains out,' says Chapman to the camera as she receives free food and racially abuses the people serving her

'I'm from Indiana in Kentucky,' Chapman tells the man, 'And up there this s**t doesn't happen,' she says, but goes on to mention that 'One time they p*ssed in my fries where I'm from at home. Literally I could smell the p*ss.'

'So I know they're probably sh*ttin' and p*ssin in it, because they really don't give a sh*t,' she says loudly.

'That's why I'm not eating this food, I'm giving it to my boyfriend.'

The worst is yet to come, though, when Chapman spies the woman she believed was rude to her the night before.

'Well, guess what? This s**t’s about to go live, b***h. Right on Facebook,' she rants.

'Cause I already posted what your dumb ass did last night. So I hope you’re happy with your little f****g sand n****r self. Cause I’m about to nuke your whole f****g planet from Mars. You think ya’ll are tough big fat Arabs bombin’ the Trade Center? I’ll show you tough,' she yells to the woman, who calmly goes about her business behind the counter.

Chapman's LinkedIn profile says she's currently the marketing manager for Comfort Care Medical Equipment, but according to The Smoking Gun the company says she hasn't worked there for more than a year.

Chapman, whose LinkedIn profile says she went to Nova Southeastern University in Orlando, also has a YouTube channel on which she has posted numerous marketing videos of low production quality.

Expressing her excitement at posting the
 video, she says, 'Hi Facebook, this is what you have to do in life, it 
f*****g sucks. Blow my brains out,' a sentiment shared by many who have 
seen the video.

Craig11152 commented, 'I think she is mentally ill.'

Jack Silver describes her as 'a disgusting piece of gutter slime' and writes:

'Clearly you are not employed with that level of ignorance. The best part about this is once it's on the internet, it's there FOR EVER. I hope any prospective employer/boyfriend/in-laws gets a good look at what a piece of trash you really are.'

Daraymann wrote, 'And now everybody knows what﻿ kind of a human being you are. God bless the internet.'

Chapman has removed her Facebook page, but the video of which she was so proud remains on YouTube, where its comment section is growing ever longer.
