A bear cub that was due to be euthanized after biting 14 Missouri university students last weekend has been saved after those it attacked intervened.

Boo Boo the bear was part of an entourage of cuddly young animals brought to Washington University in St Louis to help calm the nerves of students before exams.

But the youngster was a bit too rough, and ended up causing fears of a rabies outbreak after nipping some students so hard that it broke their skin.

Saved: Boo Boo the bear cub was due to be euthanized after biting 14 Washington University students

Because the two-month-old cub had been born in the wild, the university feared it may have been carrying the deadly virus, but the only way to be sure was to carry out tests after it had been euthanized.

When students heard that Boo Boo's life was hanging in the balance however, they pleaded to save the cub's life and offered to have rabies vaccinations themselves rather than let the bear be killed.

Student Kaity Cullen told Fox 2: 'I think most people right now are upset because to test the bear they have to euthanize it.

'Even being bitten, I would rather just go get the shots, and that appears to be the overwhelming opinion among the students.'

The bear cub was brought to campus last weekend as part of an annual event in which a selection of animals from Cindy's Zoo are made available to students.

Boo Boo hadn't been listed on the zoo's website as being among the 'animal friends' taken on the visits, and university officials said they weren't told in advance that a bear would be on campus.

Usually, the mobile petting zoo consists of a baby camel, llama, farmyard animals and, occasionally, an armadillo.

The university announced on Friday that officials had decided against euthanizing the cub, and said they no longer believed he posed a threat.

'We are thrilled that this very unfortunate situation has come to the best possible conclusion for everyone involved - our students, our community and the bear cub,' university spokeswoman Susan Killenberg McGinn said.

The campus's Twitter account also announced that Boo Boo would be saved, sending out a tweet on Friday afternoon that read: 'Bear cub does not pose rabies threat, students do not need treatment, cub will be spared.'
