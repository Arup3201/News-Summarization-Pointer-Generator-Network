Unions have tightened their grip on Labour and are now responsible for three-quarters of all big donations to party coffers.

The Unite union, which went to war with Ed Miliband over plans to curb union influence, gave £722,195 from April to June this year.

New figures reveal that even the Lib Dems have raised more from individual non-union donors than the Labour party since the election.

Red Ed: Five of the biggest trade unions accounted for three-quarters of the total donations to Labour coffers in the three months to the end of June

The revelations will heap further pressure on Mr Miliband, who has faced growing criticism for his failure to set the political agenda in recent weeks.

A new opinion poll shows 40 per cent of people now back David Cameron and George Osborne to run the economy, compared to just 24 per cent for Mr Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.

The Labour leader is caught between trying to widen the appeal of his party while relying increasingly on trade unions to bankroll his campaign for Number 10.

Most people use their will to leave money to family and friends, charities or the church.

But one mystery woman decided to donate more than half a million pounds to whoever was in power.

Joan LB Edwards bequeathed a sum of £520,000 to the party in government at the time of her death.

But with the Tories and Lib Dems in coalition, the two parties had to share the cash.

As the larger party, the Conservatives received £420,576 while the Lib Dems had £99,423.

The unusual arrangement meant the money was destined for a political party rather than the government.

Last year it emerged dead Britons had left the Treasury £54,000 to help pay off the ballooning national debt from beyond the grave.

The Electoral Commission today released details of all donations to political parties over £7,500.

In the three months to the end of June, 
Labour received a total of £3,136,447 in such donations, of which 72 per cent
came from five of the biggest unions.

Unite gave £772,195, the GMB £485,830, UNISON £458,080, USDAW £411,147 and the Communication Workers’ Union £143,121.

Labour stressed that the figures did not include smaller donations, and said union money accounted for 25 per cent of total donations since the start of the year.

Over the period Labour reduced its overdraft facilities by £2.5 million and took out two new loans of £1.22 million each with the Co-operative Bank and Unity Trust Bank.

The party had outstanding loans of £12.79 million at the end of June.

By contrast, the Tories are recorded as having £2.6 million of loans but have access to overdraft facilities of up to £10.13 million.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Despite Ed Miliband’s promise of change, these independent figures prove his Labour Party is still dominated by the trade unions.

‘They choose the candidates, pick the leader and remain Labour’s biggest donors - providing three quarters of the party's money.

‘Until Ed Miliband stops taking his union paymasters’ cash, he will be too weak to stand up for hardworking people.

‘Instead, he can only offer what the union barons want in return for their money - the same old Labour policy of more spending, more borrowing and more debt, exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.’

In the money: David Cameron's Conservatives received most in donations overall, while Nick Clegg's Lib Dems had more in donations from non-union sources than the Labour party, lead by Ed Miliband

The UK Independence Party was buoyed by donations more than doubling to £160,000.

It included a single payment to its Tiverton and Honiton branch worth £50,000, the second highest payment to a local association of any party.

UKIP has grown hugely in the last year, picking up an extra 15,000 members.

Last month Unite general secretary Len
McCluskey aid out a £63billion shopping list of left-wing policies he 
says Labour must adopt or lose millions in funding.

He
said the Labour leader had to be ‘bold’ and reverse the coalition’s 
benefit reforms, halt spending cuts and borrowing billions to build 
1million extra homes.

Labour’s reliance on union backing means it now raises less from individuals than Nick Clegg’s Liberal Democrats.

In the latest three months, the Lib Dems raised £801,000 from non-union donations while Labour received only £730,000.

Since the 2010 general election the Lib Dems have raised £6million from individuals compared to £4million for Labour.

And Mr Miliband has struggled to widen the supporter base, with only 305 individual Labour donors, compared to 1,077 for the Lib Dems.

Even with the union barons bankrolling the party, Labour still received less than the Conservatives.

David Cameron's party received a total of £4,116,006, including major donations from businessmen.

The largest gifts to the Conservatives were £280,770 from co-treasurer and hedge fund boss Michael Farmer and £263,600 from investment banker James Lupton.

Labour said the Tories received £1,042,970.93 in the last quarter from donors who attended private dinners with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers. It included £694,370 from donors in the financial sector.

Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, said: 'The Tories have raked in over £1 million from private dinners with David Cameron and senior Ministers in the last quarter.

'And more than two thirds of that comes from the City – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes David Cameron cut.

'Hardworking families are seeing their living standards squeezed, with prices rising faster than wages. Meanwhile David Cameron shows how out of touch he is, standing up for the millionaires who fund his party.'

Meanwhile, the new figures show the Ministry of Sound gave £65,000 to the Lib Dems, just weeks before the nightclub's boss James Palumbo received a peerage from Nick Clegg.

The superclub firm made a donation of £50,000 to the central party on June 6, and on June 30 a further £15,000 was given to the Bermondsey and Old Southwark local association of Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes.
