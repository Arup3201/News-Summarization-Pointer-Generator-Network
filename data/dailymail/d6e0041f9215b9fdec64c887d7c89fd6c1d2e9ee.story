More than 50 National Guardsmen are being booted out of Manhattan’s Lexington Armory to make way for models including Alessandra Ambrosio and a Victoria's Secret runway fashion show on Wednesday.

About 300 uniformed personnel have been sleeping at the armory in between hurricane-relief shifts since Superstorm Sandy hit last Monday.

But by Wednesday this week their numbers will need to be reduced by 60 to make way for the event which will see the Victoria's Secret ‘Angels' take to the runway to display the brand's latest lingerie collections and appearances by Rihanna and Justin Bieber.

Moving out: Members of the National Guard who've been supporting the Sandy relief effort in Manhattan need to find alternative accommodation for the next few nights

Military personnel are currently looking at alternative accomodation options for their men including the Jacob Javits Center on 11th Avenue, the Harlem Armory and even hotels. The men will be expected to bunk five to 10 to a room.

‘It’s going to be tight. It’s not ideal,’ one Air National Guardsman told the New York Post.

The armory is home to the 69th Infantry Regiment, part of the New York Army National Guard and known as the ‘Fighting Sixty-Ninth’.

The regiment aren’t complaining too much about the models moving in because they owe a debt of gratitude to the producers of the fashion show.

Along with the rest of lower Manhattan, the armory lost power on last Monday after Sandy hit.

Fortunately, the Victoria Secret’s producers had hauled in eight massive 500 kilowatt generators which were then used to heat and light the armory until power was eventually restored on Friday.

‘We were dead in the water until Victoria’s Secret showed up,’ Capt. Brendan Gendron, the Regiment’s operations officer, told Wired.

The Victoria's Secret team also loaned a forklift which was used in the food distribution effort.

As they have done for the past three years, the lingerie company is holding its annual television event at the historic armory, located at 25th street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.

Wednesday’s show will feature Victoria's Secret favorites Lily Aldridge, Doutzen Kroes, Behati Prinsloo, Candice Swanepoel, and Adriana Lima.

Brazilian beauty Alessandria Ambrosia has recently had a baby, has been chosen to model the coveted Fantasy Treasure Bra worth an estimated $2.5 million.

Victoria’s Secret Angel Lily Aldridge has recently tweeted her excitement about the forthcoming event and her concern for the victims of Superstorm Sandy.

Wednesday's show will be aired on CBS on December 4, last year's event was watched by over 11.5 million viewers.

Last night, about 150 of the guardsmen were crammed into a space meant for 50 as Victoria’s Secret workers moved in equipment and set up temporary dressing rooms. The military workers will be allowed to return to their armory digs on Thursday.
