Emmanuel Adebayor has been recalled by Togo to play for the national team for the first time in 18 months as they get their African Nations Cup qualifying campaign under way next week.

The 30-year-old Tottenham striker had refused call-ups for last year’s World Cup qualifiers in the wake of a public spat with coach Didier Six after the 2013 African Nations Cup finals in South Africa.

Adebayor was critical of the former French international’s work even after Togo reached the Nations Cup quarter-finals for the first time.

Never one for a low-key entrance, Mario Balotelli embraced his new team’s colours by arriving at White Hart Lane wearing a pair of bright red trainers.

Raheem Sterling’s goal in the first half ensured Liverpool scored in their 16th consecutive top flight game away from home. That equalled the club record set between May 1987 and March 1988.

Former Spurs defender Michael Dawson, now at Hull City, signed off at White Hart Lane by picking a Spurs dream team from his nine years at the club in Sunday’s matchday programme. 

His line-up would take some beating... given that he named 12 players because he couldn’t choose between Jermain Defoe and Dimitar Berbatov. 

The team was: Lloris; Walker, King, Dawson, Rose; Lennon, Modric, Huddlestone, Bale; Keane, Defoe, Berbatov.
