A motorist was left trapped between a lorry and a bus this morning after a crash involving nine vehicles.

Emergency services were called to a multiple pile-up on the A174 eastbound towards Redcar, Cleveland at around 7.10am this morning.

The Ford Focus was left crushed between an Arriva bus, which was not carrying any passengers, and a HGV, but the driver was released from hospital today.

Terrifying: The crash involved nine vehicles including one that was left crushed

Horror: A motorist was stuck between a lorry and a bus after a devastating collision

The massive accident caused rush hour traffic to come to a complete standstill

Fire crews worked to free the male 
driver of the Focus who along with the driver of the bus was taken to James
Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

Drivers
were warned to stay away from the area and find alternative routes - 
with the crash bringing traffic to a complete standstill.

Arriva also had to divert buses as a result of the smash.

Meanwhile, two other bus crashes across the country resulted in dozens of injuries.

Nine people were injured after a bus smashed into a garden wall in Sarisbury Green, near Southampton when the driver fell ill at the wheel.

Passengers told of their horror after
bricks crashed through the windows of the vehicle, which had hit parked
cars and mounted a pavement near Southampton.

One of those on board was a 75-year-old man who had got on the First Solent bus only minutes earlier.

He said the bus hit a 4x4 and mounted 
the opposite pavement, knocking down metal railings outside one property
and a wall outside another.

The pensioner added that the vehicle ended up on top of the wall, with its front wheels off the ground.

The passenger, who asked not to be named, said: 'I didn't think about being frightened because it all happened so quickly.

'But I panicked when bricks started to come through the front window of the bus.'

The road in Sarisbury Green, near Southampton, was closed for three hours as the scene was cleared following the incident.

Retired James Evans, who lives at one
of the properties affected by the crash, said he heard several bangs as
the bus smashed into the wall.

He
said: 'The passengers were all climbing out of the bus - they were 
terrified obviously - and there was quite a lot of damage to the 
vehicle.'

Lucky: Witnesses say that it is fortunate that more people weren't hurt in the accident

Injured: Nine people were injured while the driver is being treated in hospital

Gladys Blackwell, 88, whose front garden was also damaged, added: 'I was out the back of my house and heard this horrible crash.

'When
I came in the bus was actually in next door's front garden. My first 
thought was "thank goodness nobody was walking along the path" - it 
could have been a lot worse.'

The single-decker Solent Ranger bus was operating on the X4 service from Southampton to Fareham near Portsmouth.

The driver is now recovering in hospital.

In a separate incident, 25 passengers were injured in a head-on collision between two buses in Salford, Greater Manchester.

The incident saw a single-decker bus and a double-decker bus smash at a junction during rush hour.

The
25 passengers were treated for minor injuries while the driver of the 
single-decker bus was the most seriously injured, suffering from head 
injuries.

Firefighters said they isolated the power to the buses, which were both stranded in the middle of Lower Broughton Road, and began helping the injured.

There was congestion on a number of routes around Salford while the incident was dealt with.

Among the vehicles caught up in the traffic chaos was the convoy taking Dale Cregan to Preston Crown Court where he is on trial for murder.

He has already admitted killing police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes but is accused of killing father and son David and Mark Short.Armed police had to surround the convoy carrying Cregan to court.

Police officers holding guns got out of their cars and surrounded the van carrying Cregan when it was forced to stop on a suburban street in Salford.
