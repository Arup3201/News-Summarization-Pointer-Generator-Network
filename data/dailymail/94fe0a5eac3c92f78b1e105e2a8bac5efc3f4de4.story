A woman who tripped on high-street cobbles and became impaled on a spiked fence has been cut free by firefighters.

Yvonne Baker, 30, was walking in Rochester High Street, Kent, to have drinks with friends when she tripped on the cobbled road.

Witnesses told how they heard Ms Baker scream 'I'm going to die' as she fell towards the spiked fence and one of the four inch spikes pierced her upper arm.

A number of people rushed to her side after witnessing the accident on Sunday May 26, at 10pm.

Firefighters cut her free and she was taken to hospital by South East Coast Ambulance Service with the length of metal still in her arm.

Riccardo Ragazzo, 39, a chef in a nearby restaurant was the first at the scene to help.

He said: 'I was going home after my work in the high street when I saw the woman slip.

'First I thought she was just in pain from the fall, but then I realised she her right arm was impaled on a spike.

'She started screaming I'm going to die. She was slipping in and out of consciousness because of the pain.

She has since had no feeling in her hand but doctors hope it will return in time

'She was fighting to fee her arm but I held her to stop he moving because I knew if she moved she would lose a lot of blood.'

Ms Baker was due to undergo surgery to remove the spike from her arm but a sudden movement by her caused it to fall out.

She has since had no feeling in her hand but doctors hope it will return in time.

Ms Baker's mum, Annie Woolcock, said it could have been much worse.

She said: 'She is pretty shaken up, but she knows how lucky she is that it went in her arm and not her head.

'When she was at school she knew a boy who went over his handle bars on his bike and got a metal spike through his head and died.

'She remembered that and was really shaken up. We are just really grateful it wasn't anything more serious and want to thank everyone who helped.'
