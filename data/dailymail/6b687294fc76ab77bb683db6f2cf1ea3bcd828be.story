At the end of a contest that produced the expected result, there was an unexpected moment, a hug between Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho.

If the two men have decided to get along after a few years of discord then its perhaps as well. They will be seeing quite a bit of each other over the coming years.

Before this season started, most people had Manchester City and Chelsea as the two teams most likely to win the Barclays Premier League. Perhaps we should go further now. After only a month of the new season, they look the only teams capable of winning it.

Rival managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho embrace after the 1-1 draw at the Etihad on Sunday

Speaking on TV at full-time yesterday, former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness said eloquently: ‘These two are head and shoulders above everybody else. They don’t have weaknesses.’ On a weekend that saw Liverpool fail at West Ham and Manchester United embarrass themselves at Leicester, this was proper football.

There was resilience, organisation and devastating quality. There were goals from substitutes and contributions from players operating in unfamiliar positions.

There was an absence of panic from Manchester City when they fell a man, and then a goal, behind. Equally there was no complacency from Chelsea when they won a lead the general pattern of play had not pointed to.

Had Diego Costa not struck a post with the score at 1-0, they would have had a win of significance.

Referee Mike Dean almost ruined the afternoon. Not by sending off Pablo Zabaleta for a second booking, but by distributing so many yellow cards in the first half that a red one always seemed possible, if not inevitable, later on.

A victory for Chelsea would have felt just a little hollow. Until the sending off, they had been marginally second best in a contest that was notable at that point for some expert defending by both teams.

Eliaquim Mangala, on debut for Manchester City, was magnificent alongside Vincent Kompany in defence

Despite the late drama, the pairings of Vincent Kompany and Eliaquim Mangala and John Terry and Gary Cahill were the stand-out features of this game. Partnerships like those win titles, despite the millions of pounds invested in players at the other end of the field.

Happily, City were able to regain parity. Happily because it left us talking about a fair result and a remarkable Frank Lampard story rather than the referee’s influence.

City’s equaliser was interesting and told us much about their qualities. James Milner had performed terrifically down the right side, providing evidence that English players can thrive at City if they are good enough.

But it was from the position of left back that he advanced to provide Lampard with the opportunity to equalise.

Running on to David Silva’s chipped pass, Milner was on the stretch but the touch he applied to the ball was perfect in weight and in direction.

Substitutes are increasingly important in the Premier League, especially to those clubs with Champions League commitments. Squads win championships, as they say.

Andre Schurrle is a good one, too. The German showed this during the World Cup in Brazil. Here, he timed his far post run perfectly in the 71st minute, allowing him to make the most of a superb Eden Hazard cross that was enabled in the first place by a superb turn and pass from Costa.

This is what makes these teams so impressive, so effective. Costa, for example, had endured a difficult afternoon. In trying to impose himself physically on City captain Kompany, he had failed.

In essence, he had lost one of the pivotal personal duals of the game. Still, though, he was able to influence the outcome.

Both clubs have benefited from long-term planning and transfer strategy. As United are finding, big money deals pushed through at the last minute will only take you so far.

Mangala was immense on his debut on Sunday, only slightly less effective than Kompany. Costa also emerged to play his part, too.

Chelsea and City were fine teams last season but they have improved and whether anyone else can really get near them is very doubtful.

In the press conference room, Pellegrini and Mourinho reverted to type and started criticising each other. Maybe that hug meant nothing at all. Maybe it pointed at relief and satisfaction in equal measure.
