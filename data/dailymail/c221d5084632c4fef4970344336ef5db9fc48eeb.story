Wayne Rooney has said that former Manchester United players Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes are the best he has ever played with, while current Red Devils winger Ashley Young is the funniest person at the club. 

Taking part in a Q and A session with some fans during a promotional campaign for Wing's Chinese Restaurant in Manchester, the England captain reflected on life at one of the world's biggest clubs. 

Pressed for an answer on who were there most talented players he had played alongside he said, 'There's been so many. I can tell you two. I can't tell you one. Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes. Those two, for different reasons, have been fantastic.'

Rooney hailed former United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo as one of the best players he has ever played with 

Ronaldo played for United between 2003 and 2009, before moving to Spanish giants Real Madrid for a then world-record £80 million fee. 

Scholes spent his entire playing career at United, clocking up 718 appearances and scoring 155 goals in all competitions for the club.  

Asked who was the biggest joker at United, Rooney pointed to Ashley Young, but admitted that former midfielder Anderson was also a 'character' and certainly ran him close.
