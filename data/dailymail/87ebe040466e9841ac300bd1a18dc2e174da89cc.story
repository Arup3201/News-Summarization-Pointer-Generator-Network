Approximately 13,000 Dream on Me bassinets have been recalled over concerns the devices are unsafe and could collapse, possibly smothering babies.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said Tuesday that the recall regards five models of Dream on Me's 2-in-1 Bassinet to Cradle.

'Dream on Me has received one incident of the wire frame support bracket failing and the fabric portion of the bassinet collapsing while an infant was asleep in the cradle,' the agency said. 'No injuries have been reported.'

Recall: Approximately 13,000 Dream on Me 2-in-1 Bassinet to Cradle products have been recalled

'The recalled model numbers are 439-A, 439-B, 439-G, 439-P and 439-W and can be found on a tag which is located under the mattress pad of the bassinet,' the agency said. 'This tag is a removable tag you see in the store but is removed prior to use.'

The CPSC also warned that 'Consumers should immediately stop using the product and contact Dream On Me to obtain a free repair.'

The message continued, 'In the meantime, parents are urged to find an alternate, safe sleeping environment for the child, such as a crib that meets current safety standards or play yard depending on the child’s age.'

The 2-in-1 Bassinet to Cradle was manufactured by the Chinese company Shanghaid Daafu Baby, CPSC said.

On its website, Dream on Me said that 'The wire supports on the sides of the bassinets can disconnect causing the fabric sides to lower; posing a risk that infants can fall out or become entrapped and suffocate.'

The company said the bassinets were sold at a number of online retail websites from May 2012 until October 2014.

Dream on Me said that its customers can get a repair kit at no cost by sending in photographs of the bassinet and the tag on the product.

Those photographs can be submitted to Dream On Me Inc, 125 Helen Street, South Plainfield, NJ 07080, and recalls@dreamonme.com.
