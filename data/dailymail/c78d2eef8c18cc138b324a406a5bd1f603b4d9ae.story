Sharks are not known for being particularly friendly towards humans.

But divers in the Bahamas have proved that with a little trickery and a lot of courage, they can balance a Caribbean reef shark vertically in the palm of their hands and even stroke the creatures' noses.

The underwater explorers have been caught on camera stroking, touching and holding the animals, which can measure 10ft (three metres) long and have been known to occasionally attack humans.

Underwater magician: One diver in the Bahamas has proved that with a little trickery and a lot of courage, he can balance a Caribbean reef shark vertically in the palm of his hand and stroke its nose (pictured)

The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi) is found in tropical waters in the western Atlantic from Florida to Brazil.

It is the most commonly-encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea and can measure 10ft (three metres) long.

It generally feeds on fish and cephalopods but has attacked humans, mainly as a result of controversial 'shark feedings'.

Normally shy of divers, the shark has been known to become aggressive in the presence of food and grows sufficiently large to be considered potentially dangerous.

The creatures have been documented resting motionless on the sea floor or in caves, which is unusual behaviour for sharks.

Caribbean reef sharks have between 11 and 13 rows of teeth on the top and bottom of their jaws.

They are one of the largest apex predators in the reed system and usually feed on fish and cephalopods.

One of the divers appears to put a shark into a trance, known as a state of tonic immobility.

Tonic immobility is a natural state of paralysis which animals enter but scientists are not entirely sure why they do it.

Experts
 think 'animal hypnosis' is related to mating in sharks and is used by 
other creatures to avoid predators by 'playing dead' and blending in 
with surroundings.

It can be induced without causing any apparent stress to animals, such as stroking a certain place on a lobster's shell.

Sharks can remain in a tonic state for up to 15 minutes. Some species are 'hypnotised' when they are turned upside down.

British underwater photographer Simon 
Enderby captured the amazing moment during a routine feeding dive off 
the coast of the Bahamas.

The divers wore mesh metal gloves and body suits to help protect against the shark's teeth.

It is not just Caribbean reef sharks that can enter tonic states. Research has shown that vicious tiger sharks can be put in a ‘trance’ when gentle pressure is applied on either side of their snouts.

Some species are ‘hypnotised’ when turned upside down and when they are in a tonic state, their dorsal fins straighten and their breathing becomes more stead and relaxed.

Tonic immobility has been observed in a number of shark species and there is a great deal to learn about the benefit that the temporary trance-like state provides, Ali Hood, Director of Conservation at the Shark Trust told MailOnline.

'The state of tonic immobility is used quite extensively as an aid to shark husbandry, or when handling sharks in the wild, limiting the chance of injury to both the shark and the handler. However, there is also some evidence of sharks being induced into such a state for the amusement of tourists.

'The Shark Trust supports well managed ecotourism operations...Tourism ventures which work to engage and train local people and seek to develop a "live" value for sharks can make a real contribution to both conservation  and the local economy.

'However, questions should be raised as to just how invasive some "ecotourism" ventures have become if inducing tonic immobility has become part of the "show". The Shark Trust does not encourage handling sharks in this manner,' she added.

Tiger sharks can be put in a tonic state by placing a small amount of pressure on the sides of their snout, much like Caribbean reef sharks.

During tonic immobility, sharks' dorsal fins straighten and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed.

Great white sharks do not enter tonic states as easily as other species, although it an eye witness is said to have seen a female orca holding one upside down to put it in a 'trance' and then kill it.
