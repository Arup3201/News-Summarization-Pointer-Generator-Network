Several years ago after watching a routine Manchester United victory at the Britannia Stadium, Lou Macari was asked just why Sir Alex Ferguson's team seemed to find it easier than others in North Staffordshire.

As well as being a United player in the 1970s, Macari was a Stoke City manager in the 1990s, back in the days when the arena of intimidation was the rather more functional Victoria Ground down the A500 'D Road' from here.

Macari knows how things work in this part of the world and his answer was immediate. 

Jose Mourinho got his tactics right as Chelsea defeated Stoke 2-0 at the Britannia Stadium

The Chelsea manager speaks to Stoke's tough tackler Phil Bardsley (right) after the game

'It's simple,' he said.

'Too many teams come here anticipating a physical battle and start messing with their team and tactics. They pick big 'physical' players.

'United, though, always come here and pick footballers and tell them to play better football than Stoke. Usually, it works.'

It was tempting to think back to that conversation here on Monday night and conclude that it remains as pertinent now as it did then.

Stoke's current manager Mark Hughes has tweaked his team's style a little. They do play slightly differently than they did in the Tony Pulis days, even if his right-back Phil Bardsley did his best to drag us all back to another era altogether with some wretched early tackling on Monday night.

Nevertheless, Stoke still present an athletic challenge that some managers try – and often fail – to nullify with a like for like approach. It is a peculiar tactic and one that Jose Mourinho eschewed very sensibly.

All Barclays Premier League footballers should be able to look after themselves physically, whoever they are and what ever position they play. If they can't then they arguably shouldn't be playing the game.

Just like the great United teams of the past – and indeed Arsene Wenger's really good Arsenal teams – Mourinho's modern Chelsea combine the physical and the technical expertly. They are footballers first and foremost but, equally, you wouldn't mind having them by your side when it gets lively in the pub on a Friday night either.

It is this combination that makes them so irresistibly impressive and clear favourites to win the first Premier League title of Mourinho's second spell at Stamford Bridge.

Stoke's early approach was robust to say the least. Bardsley should have been booked for a tackle on Eden Hazard by the Chelsea byline and could perhaps have received a straight red for another on the Belgian at the other end soon after.

Chelsea didn't like it. Mourinho waved an imaginary card around on the touchline and became involved in a bickering contest with the particularly irritable Hughes.

Crucially, though, Chelsea didn't allow the feuding to transfer itself to the field. They ensured it remained a football match and that was key. 

The league leaders' opening goal came after only a minute or so and was headed in from a corner by John Terry. The match reports will detail a set piece goal but what they probably won't talk about is the lovely piece of intelligent attacking football that led to a shot that led to the corner in the first place.

Similarly, Chelsea's other really good chance of the opening 45 minutes came on the back of a passage of terrific football to which Stoke just had no answer.

A stunningly well-timed tackle from Nemanja Matic allowed Hazard to feed Cesc Fabregas and when the Premier League's top assist-maker slid the ball through to Diego Costa the Spaniard should have closed out the game instead of rolling his shot a foot wide of the far post.

It was an unusual piece of negligence from Costa but the part played in the move by Matic was terrific. The Serbian is a sensational footballer and  his contribution was bettered only by Hazard who played his football gamely and bravely all night. It was fitting he played a part in Chelsea's second goal and his performance typified his team's courage and indomitable spirit.

It all comes from their manager, of course. Few people set the tone like Mourinho does.

It's never easy here but this was as close to being comfortable as it gets. As Macari once said, the key is to come here not to fight but to play.
