A choirmaster yesterday admitted a brief but intense affair with a head girl at a world-renowned private music school where he worked.

Michael Brewer, 68, told a court he would remove the 17-year-old’s blouse and touch her breasts while she was meant to be practising her oboe, adding: ‘I was in love.’

The father of four said that at the time, in the 1990s, his then wife was having an affair and he was left feeling ‘desolate’ when the former pupil of Chetham’s School of Music, in Manchester, ended the relationship.

Michael Brewer: The choir director, 67, who denies raping a former pupil, told Manchester Crown Court his accuser was a 'fantasist' but admitted having a separate affair with a different pupil who was 17 at the time

He also admitted that when he was 
arrested for raping and sexually abusing another ex-pupil in the 
late-1970s and early-80s, he at first failed to tell police the truth 
about the affair, saying they had agreed to keep it ‘private’.

The prosecution say the affair with the head girl was part of a pattern which showed his unhealthy interest in teenage girls.

Earlier at Manchester Crown Court, 
Brewer described the alleged victim as ‘vivacious and talented’ but also
 ‘a fantasist’. Asked whether he had ever had any sexual contact with 
her, he replied: ‘No.’

Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, 
denies the charges, while his ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer denies indecent 
assault and aiding and abetting rape.

Giving evidence, he said students with problems would often be passed to him in 
his early years at Chetham's, where he worked from 1975 to 1994. One of those students was the complainant in the case, the jury heard.

Brewer said: 'She was largely living a
 fantasy life. She was finding alcohol. Also she was being disruptive in
 her boarding house and lessons, with hysterical outbursts and 
threatening suicide and self-harm and so on.'

His barrister, Kate Blackwell QC, asked him what his impressions were of her at the time.

He
 replied: 'I saw her as a very talented, vivacious musician but I was 
already aware of her problems and her lack of discipline. She found 
practice very difficult.

'Her creativity was exceptional and her application was really poor.'

He added: 'She
 was vivacious, dynamic, commanding on stage (but) underneath was 
insecure, depressive, hysterical and a fantasist.'

When asked by Miss Blackwell whether he touched the pupil 'inappropriately' in his office, Brewer replied 'no'.

He also denied inviting the then 14-year-old to perform a sex act in his office.

Brewer told the jury that he was 'very friendly' and 'jokey' with senior students at Chetham's and that he allowed them to call him 'Mike' on school trips.

'I regarded them as young adults,' he explained. 'I was very hard on their music making but very relaxed with them in every other way.'

The jury was told that the former grammar school pupil graduated in music from the University of Wales in Aberystwyth before taking a masters degree in composition.

He taught at the Royal Liberty 
School in Romford in 1967 and four years later became director of music 
at the Latimer School in Edmonton.

In 1975 he joined Chetham's and stayed until December 1994.

Prestigious: The 67-year-old choir director is accused of indecently assaulting the pupil while he was working at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester

Miss Blackwell said the choirs that Brewer had been involved with had won many prizes and he had been involved in many recordings.

In 1995 he was appointed OBE for services to music.

Brewer is said to have raped the complainant in the presence of his wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, also 67, while she was tied to their bed.

She is also on trial accused of aiding and abetting the rape and committing a separate indecent assault on the alleged victim.

The complainant said most of the abuse by Brewer took place at the school as she visited his office, and in his camper van which was parked in its grounds.

She did not consider it sexual abuse so did not make an official complaint at the time, the court heard.

On the directions of Judge Martin Rudland, the jury recorded not guilty verdicts on five counts of indecent assault on a child against Brewer due to insufficient evidence on how old she was at the time of the allegations.

Michael Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies rape and eight counts of indecent assault.

Hilary Kay Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape.

The trial continues.
