Police in three states were searching on
Saturday for a shooter or shooters who killed a state trooper and injured another in
an ambush at a police barracks in Pennsylvania.

Several hundred troopers and other law enforcement officials from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York are involved in the manhunt and 'will not rest until this individual is apprehended', Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said during an afternoon press conference.

Bryon Dickson, of Dunmore, Pennsylvania, was killed in the shooting, and Alex Douglass was wounded.

'Our people were leaving the barracks and were shot without warning and really had no opportunity to defend themselves,' Noonan said. 'It was a cowardly attack. It's an attack upon all of us in society and the people of Pennsylvania'

Crime Stoppers said it is offering $25,000 to anyone who can provide information leading to the arrest or conviction of those behind the shooting. 

'We're looking for the cooperation of the public, if it's money that would motivate you or just outrage,' Noonan said. 'We have a dangerous, armed criminal that is still not in custody.'

Dickson, who graduated from the police academy in 2007 and is a former Marine, is survived by his wife Tiffany and two young sons, a kindergartner and a second-grader.

'He was very proud of his family, and spoke often about them,' Philip Barletto, a colleague of Dickson's, posted on his Facebook page. 'I am deeply saddened by his loss.'

'He was very, very work oriented,' Melissa Contorno, who became friends with Tiffany Dickson about 12 years ago as a fellow nurse at Regional Hospital, told The Times-Tribune. 'He was all about it. He was a stand-up guy. He wanted to provide for his family. It's just awful. She spends her life taking care of people, and she's really good at what she does. Now people have to help her.'

Earlier in the day, police said they were questioning
a man about the shooting. The so-called person of interest was later identified as Jeffrey Hudak, 48, Trooper Connie Devens said, according to the AP.

Devens emphasized that Hudak was not under arrest or in custody. 

During his news conference, Noonan stressed that police will be questioning 'hundreds of people' in their investigation, and there is currently no specific person that is a suspect. 

'I don't want anyone to be unfairly tarnished,' he said.

The shooting occurred at the Blooming Grove barracks around 11pm on Friday, Noonan said earlier. The incident promped a manhunt by police from
Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.

Blooming Grove is a township of roughly 5,000 people near the New York state border.The barracks is in a wooded area, surrounded by state game lands, and runs along the Delaware River. 

SWAT teams were in full force as police hunted for the shooter or shooters behind the ambush, which left a trooper dead and another injured

'I know a lot of people are wondering if the threat is
resolved. It is not,' Noonan said at a morning news conference. 'The individual who perpetrated
this heinous crime is still at large.'

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett released a statement expressing sympathy for the family, friends and colleagues for the trooper who was killed and urging citizens to remain patient and vigilant. 

'Every attack on an officer of the law is an attack on our state, our country and civilized society,' he said in the statement. 'The incident in Blooming Grove shows, once again, that our first responders face constant danger in order that the rest of us may live in peace and safety.'

Noonan said police do not have a description or any
information on the identity of the shooter or shooters.

Noonan said the troopers were ambushed but would not share
details of the incident because it was still under
investigation.

'This has been an emotional night for all of us,' Noonan said.

Douglass, the wounded trooper, underwent surgery and was in a stable
condition, according to Noonan.

Police did not believe the general public was at risk but asked that everyone remain on the lookout for anything suspicious.  

'People in the area can come and go freely but should be alert,' Noonan said.

This is the third killing of a state trooper in the area over the last 35, according to the Pocono Record. 

Pennsylvania State Trooper Joshua Miller was shot in, 2009 by a father who had kidnapped his nine-year-old son, the paper reported. After taking the boy from his home in Nazareth, the father led police on a chase before he was cornered.

An in 1981, an 11-year veteran of the New Jersey State Police was killed by members of a radical environmental group known as the United Freedom Front during a traffic stop.
