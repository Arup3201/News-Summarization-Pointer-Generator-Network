Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has labelled Bojan Krkic 'exceptional' after the former Barcelona forward wreaked havoc on Arsenal at the Britannia Stadium. 

Bojan scored one and could have had a second were it not for an offside ruling during Stoke's 3-2 win on Saturday, and Hughes feels his summer signing is repaying  his reported £3million cost.

The 24-year-old joined from Barcelona in July on a four-year deal, and nabbed his second Barclays Premier League goal this season as Arsene Wenger's Arsenal left Stoke with nothing.

'It was an outstanding second goal by Bojan, who once again has put in a really impressive performance,' Hughes said.

'I think since he's come back into the side he has played four or five games and I think he has been our man of the match in every game he's played since he's come back. He's playing exceptionally well.

'He's showing everybody that not only is he a good player technically but, in terms of his work rate and what he tries to do for the team, he's very much a team player as well and we're reaping the benefits of that.

'He's integrated very, very well because he's a good personality as well, works hard every day to get better and works hard for the team.'

Bojan would have had a brace when his shot from distance crept in but Mame Biram Diouf was flagged for offside, the linesman deeming the striker to be interfering with play.

But manager Hughes feels Bojan was denied a perfectly legitimate goal.

'It was a really disappointing decision of the referee to chalk out an outstanding individual goal by Bojan, created by himself,' Hughes continued.

'You really should look to encourage positive play rather than look for a reason to penalise us.

'So we've gone from a situation where we could have been 4-0 up, that puts a spring in their step and very quickly we're looking at 3-2 and we're hanging on when the game should have been dead and buried.

'But we've got ourselves together and for the most part we saw it out quite comfortably.'
