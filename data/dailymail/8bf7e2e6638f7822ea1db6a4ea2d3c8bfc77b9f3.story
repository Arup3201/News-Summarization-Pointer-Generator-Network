A British backpacker allegedly set fire to a French tourist who had wrapped himself in toilet paper for a fancy-dress party in Sydney.

The 31-year-old French man had turned up at a hostel in the guise of an Egyptian mummy.

But the 30-year-old Briton, who has not been named, set the toilet paper alight resulting in the other man receiving serious burns, police say.

An ambulance had to be called to the 
hostel, in the popular backpacker Sydney resort of Manly, and the French
 man was rushed to hospital, where he was said today to be in a stable 
condition.

But a spokesman 
for Sydney’s Royal North Shore Hospital said the burned man would have 
to undergo skin grafts to his upper back, neck and right arm.

A backpacker, who was there at the time, said: ‘Everyone put on some kind of silly costume for what was just a dress-up party.

‘There
 was a lot of yelling and shouting when the French man’s toilet paper 
costume, which he put on to make himself look like a mummy, went up in 
flames. It was pretty frightening at the time.’

The British tourist, who is from Wales, later went to Manly police station and gave a statement before being charged with recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Detective Inspector Graham Cope said the incident did not appear to be a malicious attack.

‘Setting fire was certainly a reckless act but probably this could best be described as a prank.’

The Welsh man has been granted bail to appear at Manly Local Court next month.
