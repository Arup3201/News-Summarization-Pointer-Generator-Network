Nobody is more excited than I am to learn that wavy hair is back in vogue.

As someone who has been battling frizz and wayward natural curl for more than a decade, I have long waited for this moment.

In fashion circles, they’ve dubbed the must-have look ‘the mermaid wave’, by which we’re talking tousled, natural-looking, wavy locks.

New wave: Charlotte Kemp tries the Lee Stafford Chopstick Styler on her own hair

Or you could call it the low maintenance bounce, as long as you find the right products to keep waves smooth and fuzz free (I’d highly recommend Windle and Moodie’s new Fortifying Spray which smoothes, and adds bounce and shine).

But the long and short of it is that it’s time to pack away those straightening tongs. What we need is a gadget to perfect, not iron out, our curls which is why even ghd, the king of straighteners, has a new curling range.

‘The key to perfecting this look is not to make waves or curls look too uniform,’ says Jordan Garrett, senior stylist at Hershesons. ‘You don’t want an Eighties-style perm. You want playful, feminine movement.’

But how easy is it to achieve this new look at home? I’ve road-tested eight curling tongs and wands to find out which is the best — and Jordan also gives his verdict.

Mark Hill Bad Girl Glam Wicked Waver

£59.99, markhill.co.uk

CHARLOTTE SAYS: This has a heated, corkscrew barrel you wind hair around. After waiting for it to heat up, you wrap a section of hair in the grooves, hold for a few seconds and then release. You get a loose curl with good staying power but you need to straighten hair first with a brush for a smooth finish.

Has variable heat settings from 120c to 200c.

JORDAN SAYS: I am not a massive fan of the spiral barrel — if you don’t get the hair in the grooves, you get a kink in the wave. But it’s easy to use and quick. Start from the cheek bone for a softer, natural wave that frames the face. That way you avoid the dropped perm look.

ghd Curve Creative Curl Wand

£110, ghdhair.com

CHARLOTTE SAYS: The wand is tapered — it’s round at the top narrowing to an oval tip — to achieve loose waves. Works best if you tackle the hair in very small sections, but that means it’s time consuming. Twist a small section of hair at the root then wind round the barrel, hold for a few seconds and release.

Comes in a stylish clutch with a heat-resistant mat to rest the wand on, but there’s only one heat setting.

JORDAN SAYS: I like wands because they’re easy to use at home. Don’t look in the mirror or you will get in a tangle. Just split the hair roughly into sections and wind it round. Practise with the heat off, and keep the wand horizontal to avoid prom hair.

Lee Stafford Chopstick Styler

£19.49, leestaffordelectricals.com

CHARLOTTE SAYS: This heats up quickly (just one temperature) and it’s very easy to use. You just wind sections of hair around the tong, hold for a few seconds and release. But if the sections are too small, you get really tight corkscrew curls—a great look for the young but ageing and dated if you’re the wrong side of 40. One for a teen daughter or niece?

JORDAN SAYS: The smaller the tong, the tighter the wave. The key here is how you section the hair. If you divide it into big sections, this styler is excellent for perfecting a fashionable Twenties Hollywood wave. If the sections are too small, you’ll end up with an Eighties corkscrew perm curl. My only gripe is the barrel is rectangular rather than cylindrical which means curls have a slight dent.

Instyler Wet 2 Dry Rotating Iron

£69.99, argos.co.uk

CHARLOTTE SAYS:  This is designed to dry, smooth and curl the hair. There’s a brush on one side and a heated rotating barrel on the other, so you put sections of wet hair between the two, close it and pull hair through from roots to ends. It’s quite noisy because the barrel is motorised. It takes a long time to dry long hair, too. I got a flick at the front, but it was hard to achieve a tight curl and impossible to reach the back of my hair. Best for shorter hair. Has three temperature settings.

JORDAN SAYS:This is like a hairdryer meets tong — and it would be difficult to use on yourself. I think it’s better at straightening than curling, and to dry a head of hair would take ages.

Glamoriser Professional Digital Auto Curler by Richard Ward

£74.99, richardward.com

CHARLOTTE SAYS: This curls hair around a heated barrel using a rotating motor. You just put a section of hair in the clamp, starting from the ends, and press rotate. The barrel then spins and the hair winds up.

Once the tong is near the roots, there’s a button to rotate the barrel the other way so you can release the curl, but it’s hard to find so I got in a tangle a few times. My conclusion — best to get a friend to help.

Comes in a heat-resistant bag with heat-resistant glove. You can vary the temperature from 80c to 210c.

JORDAN SAYS: I think the rotating technology is tricky to use if you are trying to curl hair by yourself. You can’t see the control buttons easily, so I’d suggest using it like a wand instead. Wind hair round the barrel by hand and then it works really well as it’s a good weight, and the barrel is big, so it makes lovely waves and curls.

Hershesons Professional Tourmaline Waving Tong

£98, hershesons.com

CHARLOTTE SAYS: This is light to hold, though I found it tricky to master at first. Using the long clamp, which you open and shut with a lever, you can smooth hair before curling it up which is great for banishing frizz. To do this, you put a section of hair in the clamp starting near the root and pull it down along the heated barrel. Then you wind the hair around the barrel to get a curl.

It heats up quickly, too, with variable temperature settings from 130c to 230c. The curls and waves had real lasting power and were shiny and smooth. Comes with a heat resistant mat in a stylish drawstring bag.

JORDAN SAYS: ‘This has a long cable so you can work round the head easily. It’s suitable for any hair length too — the clamp will give you better control when you are working with shorter hair. Use a lower temperature for coarse or fine hair. Thicker hair will need a higher setting for the wave not to fall out.

Babyliss Curl Secret

£120, babyliss.co.uk

CHARLOTTE SAYS: When you close this space age looking clamp on a section of hair, it gets sucked into a heated roller chamber and held there. You then wait for the timer to bleep so you can release the hair — and there should be a curl. But it didn’t work very well on long hair, only achieving a wave at the ends. The hair didn’t always get sucked into the chamber either. A bit gimmicky.

Comes with a heat protection mat and has two heat settings and three time settings.

JORDAN SAYS: This does the job but it’s quite hard work to line up each section of hair with the gadget so it can be sucked into the ‘curl chamber’ correctly. Best for shorter hair, I’d say.

Diva Big Waves

£89.99, divapro.co.uk

CHARLOTTE SAYS:  Very easy to use — it’s like a crimper, only the grooves are much wider so you end up with a Veronica Lake wave. Take a section of hair and clamp the waver close to the roots, hold a few seconds and release then continue moving down the hair section linking the waves. Don’t leave your hair in for too long to avoid damage.

It’s not just a one trick pony — if you clamp the waver shut at the ends of a section of hair, you can wind hair around the outside to get a big barrel curl.

JORDAN SAYS: This is excellent for achieving a slick, uniform wave if your hair is one length. Take long sections and crimp, starting near the root. Work your way down keeping the grooves lined up.
