It was two months ago but Rabbitohs co-owner and actor Russell Crowe has finally opened up about the night his team staged that historic win to claim NRL grand final glory.

The gut wrenching 43-year South Sydney premiership drought, the NRL's longest, ended when South Sydney prevailed 30-6 over the Canterbury Bulldogs in an epic decider in October.

And the jubilation not only showed on the players' faces who teared up but the man who has stood by their side, who held his players smiling faces in his hands following victory.

It was a night Russell Crowe says he will never forget.

'I remember all of it. Crystal clear like it was last night. The energy in the stadium was amazing. I was there in 2000 the night Cathy Freeman won her gold medal,' Crowe told The Daily Telegraph. 

He said it was a grand final that had it all, thrilling until the end, 'competitive, brutal and skilful'. 

But while most would imagine Crowe would be out celebrating the night away after his team's most historic win, the father of two said he simply enjoyed the rest of the night with family and friends at home and with his two sons who 'stayed up late and went nuts'.

Crowe admitted he had to wake up early the next day to work on a film he was directing.

'I missed all the other celebrations at Souths Juniors and Town Hall but I was just so grateful that luck had put me in town, working in Sydney the year something magical happened,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

The Bunnies devotee will now work with billionaire businessman James Packer, the club's other owner, to transform South Sydney into a superclub.

Crowe will also continue his strong relationship with coach Michael McGuire who he says committed to the club with heart and soul to finish the season as premiers.

As for the players, Crowe says he will never forget that 17 that took the field that day and rose his beloved Rabbitohs to the 2014 win.

He says their commitment and integrity throughout the season was able to top off an incredible year.
