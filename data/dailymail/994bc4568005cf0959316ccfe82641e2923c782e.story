Parents have taken to social media to express their outrage over a local council ordering a cafe to take down its cubby house after receiving complaints from neighbours that the children playing on it were making too much noise.

Naremburn's Sprout Wholefood Cafe and Grocer - in Sydney's north - made the announcement on Facebook on Monday it had been sadly asked by Willoughby Council to take it down.

'It is with much regret that due to neighbouring complaints about "children's noise (laughter/fun!!!)" that Sprout have been ordered by council to remove the kids cubby house,' the post read.

Naremburn's Sprout Wholefood Cafe and Grocer - in Sydney's north - made the announcement on Facebook on Monday it had been sadly asked by Willoughby Council to take the cubby house down

'Anyone who would like to dismantle and take the cubby please personal message us as by Sunday we sadly will be removing the cubby.

'We would like to see this go to another home where children enjoying playtime is not classified as a noise disturbance.'

But the news caused a backlash against the council, with angry patrons labelling the move was 'outrageous'.

'Serious? Can we still come and have a play on the lawn? This is so sad. Shame on you, sour residents of Naremburn!' one woman wrote on the cafe's Facebook page.

The cubby house is a popular feature at the cafe for parents to relax and eat while their children play

Cafe owner Joe Melham said at first he was taken aback by the council's order, but knew where they were coming from

Another said: 'I am absolutely gobsmacked! Sprout is such a perfect (and yummy) spot for families BECAUSE of the back section and this adorable cubby. Council shouldn't even listen to such fickle complaints.'

'This is terrible! We love this cubby house. It's not like kids are running around at 10pm at night. What a shame. I doubt it's the cubby *specifically* that is making kids laugh anyway #funpolice,' a parent posted.

Cafe owner Joe Melham said at first he was taken aback by the council's order.

'We were a little bit shocked because we didn't realise we needed to get a DA [development approval] for a cubby house,' he told Channel 9's Today.

Mr Melham has met with Willoughby Council mayor Gail Giles-Gidney about the cubby house

'We understood the reason they gave us but at the end of the day it's not a fixed structure. It's just a little small cubby house.'

Mr Melham has met with Willoughby Council mayor Gail Giles-Gidney and said it was going to take a lot of money to keep the cubby house but it was something they were willing to do.

But there were no guarantees from Ms Giles-Gidney that the cubby house could stay. 

'After the overwhelming response we've gotten from the community and the broader community... we're more than happy to spend the money to actually keep the cubby house,' he said. 

Willoughby Council said initially permission for the use of the concrete area at the back of the cafe was not sought by the cafe.

'By adding additional seating on the deck area as well as to the concrete area plus providing the cubby house they are intensifying their use of the space which is resulting in noise spill to residential properties on surrounding streets,' a statement to Daily Mail Australia from the council said.

'As no formal council approval was sought to use this additional space in this way, [the] council was unable to assess the overall impact or consult with neighbours.

'[The] council has requested the owners seek approval to increase the businesses use of the property.'

According to the council, Mr Melham has indicated he will lodge an application in February so residents and patrons to formally give their comment.

In the mean time, the cafe and the council have reached a compromise. 

'While they are preparing their application, [the] council and the café have agreed to keep the cubby house in place, and remove the additional seating located on the lower concrete area,' the statement went on further to say.

Ms Giles-Gidney said she understood the community's concern over the cubby house issue.

'Our objective is to strike a balance for all stakeholders in this situation including the operator, the patrons and neighbouring residents,' she said.
