The multi-millionaire owner of Lucas Oil has backtracked and apologized after she posted a furious rant to Facebook bemoaning the Muslims, atheists and minorities she claimed were 'running' the country.

Indianapolis Colts backer Charlotte Lucas, 65, who is worth $300 million and founded Lucas Oil in the late 1980s with her husband, Forrest, 69, posted the controversial message to the social network on Thursday before deleting it.

'I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!' wrote Lucas. 'As far as I'm concerned, I don't think that atheists (minority), muslims (minority) n (sic) or any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here.

'Is everyone so scared that they can't fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?'

Lucas confirmed the posting was written by her to an ABC affiliate, although the car lubricant multi-millionaire claimed that she was emotional when she let fly her invective against minorities across the country.

'I was very upset when I wrote that,' she said to ABC 6, without explaining what caused her furious attack on Muslims, atheists and other unspecified minorities.

'I will not elaborate other than to say that there are certain people who are trying to make the whole world eat what they want to eat and do what they want to do.

'I don't think it's any of their business what I put in my mouth. Thank you.'

It has been speculated that Lucas may have been referring to Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move!' health campaign in mentioning eating habits, but in the absence of a full explanation it is not entirely clear.

Taking her apology further, Lucas said that she recognized her attack could have been construed as insensitive, but she had no regrets.

'I apologize to everyone for the insensitive comments posted on my Facebook account,' she said on Saturday.

'My comments did not reflect my personal views about any individual or minority group, only my frustration that our government system sometimes seems out of balance.

'We live in a great country, but the agenda for our elected officials is too often dictated by special interest groups.

'My comments did not reflect my true feelings, and I am sorry for anyone may have been offended.'

Lucas Oil's general counsel, Robert Patison, also issued a statement in light of his executive vice president's dramatic and bizarre outburst.

'Actions speak louder than words,' wrote Patison.

'Lucas Oil is a small, family-owned, American company that prides itself on being a highly integrated and diverse organization with a great sense of community.

'We provide significant financial support for a broad range of organizations that serve the needs of veterans, women, other minority groups, and disadvantaged individuals throughout the United States.

'Fairness and equality are core values of our company.'

Lucas and her husband Forest, founded Lucas Oil in 1989 and under a sponsorship agreement lend their name to the Indianapolis Colts' huge new stadium.

The family is known for their charity work and last spring, Charlotte Lucas was given the Spirit Award from the Madame Walker Theatre in Indianapolis which honored her work in philanthropy, business, culture and the arts.

The couple met in 1979 when Forrest Lucas, who had by then divorced his first wife, went to Charlotte's hair salon in Indianapolis for a trim.

'She's still a beautiful woman, but back then she was drop-dead gorgeous,' he said to the Courier Journal in a prior interview. 'I was lucky to get her.'

They married in 1982 and Lucas adopted Charlotte's son Bobby and they had their own child together, Morgan, who is a Hot Rod and Drag Racer.

According to the in depth piece by the Courier Journal, Charlotte still cuts her 69-year-old husbands hair.
