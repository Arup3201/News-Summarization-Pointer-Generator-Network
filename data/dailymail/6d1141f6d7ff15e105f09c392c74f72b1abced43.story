Hundreds of flights across Europe have been cancelled today as the French air traffic strike goes into its second day.

Thousands of travellers have been stranded due to the six-day industrial action, forced to sleep at airports or cancel their trips altogether, with some holidaymakers allegedly told they will not be able to return to Britain until next week.

While flights to and from France are the most affected, routes between the UK and Spain have also been hit, as planes have to cross French airspace to complete the route.

Walkout: The six-day strike is grounding 250 Ryanair flights today and a further 150 easyJet flights

Top dance acts Chase and Status and Magnetic Man's Artwork were among the celebrities affected by the strike.

Both were due to perform at Ibiza's Amnesia nightclub but were unable to travel.

Angry Artwork told fans on Twitter: 'So, missed going to Amnesia Ibiza tonight due to the folks at French air traffic control .... F*** you!'

Student Ellis Palmer spent 15 hours attempting to get to Barcelona yesterday to start a language course at the University of Barcelona after being faced with two cancelled Ryanair flights at two different airports.

After the initial flight at Liverpool was cancelled, the 19-year-old was sent to Manchester for an alternative departure. 

But that flight never took off after a frustrating 90 minute wait on the runway. 

Ellis, from Liverpool, is now hoping it’s third time lucky this evening as he attempts to fly out again.He told MailOnline Travel today: ‘Ryanair have rebooked my flight for a third time now.

Frustrating wait: Ellis Palmer, from Liverpool, has been trying to get to Spain to start a language course at the University of Barcelona

'The delay of my departure from the UK forced to me have to cancel my first day on a language course at the University of Barcelona which I'm undertaking as part of my university studies.

'It's been more than 24 hours since I started the journey. Yesterday I spent 15 hours attempting to travel to Barcelona and I'm still no closer to my destination after two cancelled flights at two different airports.

‘After the original flight at Liverpool was cancelled the staff were helpful and booked us on to the flight at Manchester but that was cancelled after 1h 30m on the tarmac.

‘Only one member of staff at Manchester Airport seemed to know the rights of passengers who were left stranded but thankfully I knew mine and they booked a cab home for me.

‘I eventually got back home at 1am.’

Kind-hearted Ellis then helped foreign students find accommodation for the night after they were left to sleep on the floor of the airport.

He said: 'I I helped translate their rights as I'm a Spanish language student and told them what they were entitled to.'

Knock-on effect: Passengers were delayed at Stansted Airport as the French air traffic strike got underway

After 
cancelling around 200 flights on Tuesday, Ryanair warned travellers that
 the situation is likely to worsen today, with 250 flights cancelled.

The
 budget airline slammed the industrial action by French workers and 
called on the European Commission to remove air traffic controllers' 
right to strike - as exists among police officers in the UK.

Accusing the strikers of 'blakmailing' ordinary consumers, Ryanair warned of 'severe disruption' as a result of the action.

A
 statement from the airline read: 'We expect that these delays will 
continue to build through the morning as the backlog of delayed flights 
rises. In order to minimise disruptions on the rest of our network 
Ryanair has been forced regrettably to cancel approximately 15 per cent 
of Ryanair’s total schedule of over 1,600 flights today.

'We
 expect these disruptions to flights to/from France, Belgium and Spain 
will worsen this morning as all airlines schedules are heavily disrupted
 by this unnecessary and regrettable French ATC strike.

'All customers affected by these cancellations will be offered a choice of reaccommodation on later flights or full refunds.'

EasyJet
 also confirmed that it has cancelled 150 flights today due to the 
strike as its planes are dependent on flying through French airspace.

Long wait: Extra security was drafted in at Stansted to help control the crowds gathering

Uncertainty: Chaos ruled at the airport as airlines waited on the latest news from France about whether flights could cross French airspace

A
 statement read: 'EasyJet can confirm that it will cancel 150 flights, 
of the 1,400 scheduled to operate today, due to the French air traffic 
control strike.

'As
 65 per cent of easyJet’s network travels through French air space we 
advise all passengers travelling today to be prepared for delays and to 
check the status of their flight on www.easyJet.com or via the easyJet 
flight tracker.

British
 Airways wiped out around 24 and has already axed another 28 flights 
tomorrow. Passengers with Monarch and Flybe are also badly affected.

Airlines
 unable to access congested airspace over France have done their best to
 fly around it, but flights are subject to long delays.

Thousands
 of passengers face delays and disruption at UK airports today as the 
backlog of delayed and disrupted flights grows, with Stansted drafting 
in extra security to control crowds.

Luton Airport reported delays to 60 per 
cent of departing flights while Heathrow said it had 44 cancellations. 
Gatwick said most services were held up because of knock-on effects.

Yesterday, one holiday maker at Stansted, Jane Goulding, 47, said: 'I have never seen the airport 
this busy before. I'm worried I'm going to be queuing here for hours.'

Eurocontrol,
 a European air safety organisation, estimated the action would cause 
almost 14,000 hours, of delays in total over the six days.

Delays: A spokesman for Stansted Airport said they were working with the airlines to make sure passengers had the latest information about their flights

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Check with your airline before travelling to find out if you'll be affected by the French air strike action.

'If you are affected, visit the Which? Consumer Rights website and find out your rights because if your flight is delayed due to a strike, the airline may have an obligation to offer you assistance.'

Air traffic controllers are just one of a host of sectors staging industrial action and crippling the tourism industry in France.

Rail strike is ongoing: Angry protester holds a banner opposing a rail road reform

Travellers hoping to take alternative rail routes will face further delays thanks to a ten-day rail protest.

French retail workers are also set to strike in protest at the government’s decision to introduce Sunday opening hours to boost tourism.

This will mean that famous Paris department stores including Galeries Lafayette and Printemps will be closed for those who do make it across the Channel.
