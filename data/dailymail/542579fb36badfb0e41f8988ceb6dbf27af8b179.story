HIS tennis playing skills have been honed on the court in games against the Prime Minister.

Mr Clegg, who was tennis captain of his college at Cambridge, showed off his skills, pirouetting on the court as he successfully returned shots from Mr Castle.

But perhaps still tired after his party conference speech the day before, Mr Clegg had to concede defeat and admitted he had a ‘somewhat erratic serve’.

Commons Speaker John Bercow umpired the match at Queen’s Club, which was held to raise money for Global’s Make Some Noise charity day.

Mr Bercow is a self-declared tennis nut, and has written a book called Tennis Maestros on his favourite 20 male players of all time.  

Mr Clegg and Mr Castle were joined by two listeners to LBC, who had bid in an auction to take part.

The proceeds went to the Make Some Noise charity, which supports projects that help children and young people affected by illness, disability, bereavement or lack of opportunity.

Mr Clegg said he enjoyed the game, but admitted he playing ‘without skill and without elegance’.

He said: ‘It was lovely, great great fun. It went as predicted, Andrew taught us a thing or two, I let the side down but nonetheless a great, great game of tennis, really enjoyed it.

‘I’ve played tennis a few times over the summer. I play with my brothers and the family and I’m afraid it’s just classic family tennis, we just whack it at each other.’

Mr Castle praised Mr Clegg’s skills and said he ‘hit the ball hard’ and played ‘a couple of corkers’.

He added: ‘It doesn’t take long to see whether someone has talent for a game and Nick has it.

‘The basic element of tennis is over the net and in. Make few mistakes. Nick’s view of the world when it comes to tennis is hit the ball hard and if it goes in good… if it doesn’t…’

Mr Clegg, who was a keen tennis player in his teens, took up the sport again last summer to help him lose weight.

He has shed pounds as he gets into shape ready for the general election campaign.

Shortly after the Coalition was formed, Mr Clegg and David Cameron played a match at Chequers.

Mr Clegg has played against Prime Minister David Cameron twice, and lost both times

For months neither would say who won and Mr Clegg joked it was a ‘state secret’.

But Mr Cameron, who is coached by Mr Castle, later revealed how he had triumphed.

‘It was eight-six. He is probably a better player, but I was more wily,’ he said.

Mr Cameron is said to relax at the weekend by practising with a tennis machine he has nicknamed the ‘Clegger’.
