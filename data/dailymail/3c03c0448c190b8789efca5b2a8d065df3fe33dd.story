A proud grandfather has shared his granddaughter's incredible progress after undergoing surgery for her cleft palate.  

Eighteen-month-old Lexi Grace was born in June 2013 with a severe cleft palate and lip.  

Her grandfather wrote that, although she suffered from discomfort and struggled with feeding, Lexi Grace was still 'a happy baby'.

Cleft lip and palate are caused by abnormal facial development that occurs while the child is still a fetus.

The upper lip and roof of the mouth are incompletely formed, causing the gap. 

It is one of the most common birth defects affecting children in North America, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).   

After reaching 10 pounds, Lexi Grace underwent a series of four surgeries to begin the process of having the cleft and lip repaired. 

Her grandfather wrote that, although she suffered from discomfort and struggled with feeding, Lexi Grace was still 'a happy baby'

According to 'poppy', as his granddaughter now calls him, the baby had to have 'wires and gears' inserted into her mouth that would begin to mechanically pull the palate together. 

She would have to wear them for months at a time.

Slowly Lexi Grace's appearance began to change, her grandfather wrote on online image community imgur.

Then, finally, came time to suture the two sides of the gap together.

This would require surgery inside the baby's 'mouth, on the lip and in her nose'. 

According to ASPS, the cleft is closed by using tissues and muscles to rebuild the roof of the mouth.

This is achieved by creating incisions that create flaps of tissue that are then stitched together and effectively close the cleft.

Lexi Grace's surgery was done by Larry A. Sargent, a plastic surgeon in Chattanooga, Tennessee. 

The happy grandfather says that, six months after the surgery, Lexi Grace has healed tremendously.

'You can't even tell there was a problem to begin with,' he wrote.  

But the recovery is not over yet. 

After all of Lexi Grace's upper baby teeth will need to be pulled after they grow in so that her 'upper gum line can be put in place', her grandfather wrote.

And she is currently having an especially hard time with teething. 

But the pictures don't lie. Lexi Grace is all smiles. 

Her grandfather thanked the imgur community, who he has shared Lexi Grace's story with since her birth.
