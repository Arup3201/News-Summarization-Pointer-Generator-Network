Tragic: Construction company owner Christopher Pariseleti, 41, committed suicide at the Florida mansion owned by Olivia Newton-John on Monday

Police in South Florida have identified a contractor who tragically killed himself inside a home owned by singer Olivia Newton-John and her husband on Monday.

Officers in Jupiter say an autopsy found that popular 41-year-old Christopher Pariseleti died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Pariseleti was married and had two children.

The custom home builder was working on Newton-John's $5.6 million mansion, owned by the 64-year-old singer/actress and her husband, businessman John Easterling, 61, who were out of town at the time of the shooting.

A police statement on Tuesday said: 'This case investigation has been 
classified as a suicide and there are no suspicious circumstances 
surrounding the death of Mr Pariseleti.'

Jupiter
Police spokesman Scott Pascarella said it appeared Pariseleti had 
brought the handgun used in the incident to the house himself.

'Based on preliminary information, we believe the gun did not belong to anyone in the house,' Pascarella said.

Pariseleti was the owner of Pariseleti Construction Inc. He had reportedly been working on this property for several months. Local residents say he was a well-liked figure.

Popular: A neighbor said of Pariseleti - 'He did the total remodel on the house (pictured). He was just the nicest person you ever want to meet. I can't believe it.'

Saddened: A statement from Newton-John's publicist read: 'Olivia and her husband John (pictured in this file photo) are in shock over the tragic event that occurred at their Florida home yesterday.'

Neighbor Marilyn Barfield told Celebuzz that the Pariseleti was popular as he was often working on different properties in the community.

'He's
a longtime contractor of Olivia's. He did the total remodel on the 
house,' Barfield said. 'He was just the nicest person you ever want to 
meet. I can't believe it.'

Barfield told Celebuzz that she heard a loud bang from her garden on Monday. 'I 
heard a gunshot,' she remembered.

'There was only one other person 
working over there at the time that I could see. I thought it could be 
the pressure cleaner working on the driveway. I didn't think it was a 
gun.'

Michael Caprio, Newton-John's publicist, emailed the Palm Beach Post on Tuesday afternoon.

Caprio's
statement read: 'Olivia and her husband John are in shock over the 
tragic event that occurred at their Florida home yesterday.

'At
this time we are awaiting additional information from investigators 
but, can confirm that the couple was not in Florida at the time and the 
deceased was not a family member.'

The Palm Beach Post also reported that a contractor had been seen in tears at the property on Monday afternoon.

Newton-John's
hits include You're The One That I Want with John Travolta from the 
1978 film Grease. The singer and her husband were trying to sell the 
home and had reportedly found a buyer.

Buyer? Rosie O'Donnell was rumored to be buying the property. Her publicist said: 'This is a terrible tragedy, and we're not commenting at this time.'

Lavish: The home was expected to sold for $5.6 million

Comedian
Rosie O'Donnell, who sold her own Miami mansion for $16.5 million in 
June, is said to be under contract to buy the home. One website said the
sale was worth $5.6 million.

When asked about the incident, O'Donnell's publicist told Gossip Extra: 'This is a terrible tragedy, and we're not commenting at this time.'

Property records show the couple have
owned the four-bedroom, four-bathroom home, which sits on 0.35 acres 
overlooking the water, since 2005.

Inlet Colony is a coastal community in Palm Beach with around 360 
residents and 240 homes.

Tiger Woods and Kid Rock also have properties 
in the area.
