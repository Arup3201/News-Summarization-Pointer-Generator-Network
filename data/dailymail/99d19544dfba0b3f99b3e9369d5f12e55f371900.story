The Bill Shankly Memorial Gates, Liverpool's permanent tribute to the legendary manager, have been removed to ensure their safety as improvements are made to Anfield.

The gates were carefully removed and taken to safe storage on Tuesday while major works on the stadium's Main Stand ramps up.

The gates have been in place since August 26, 1982, when they were officially opened by his widow Nessie. 

The Bill Shankly Memorial Gates, erected in 1982 in tribute to the late manager, have been removed 

The gates were carefully removed by contractors on Tuesday before being placed in safe storage

A member of the Clan Contracting team removing the gates, Andy, said he was a proud Evertonian but despite the Merseyside rivalry proclaimed the job was an 'an honour'.

'It's an honour,' Andy told the Liverpool Echo  of being entrusted with the tribute to Liverpool's former boss who led the club from the second division to become a powerhouse in Europe.

'I’m not a bitter Blue,' he said. 'Me mates are not gonna like this though. My grandkids won't like it either.

'We done the memorial as well,' Andy said, referring to the The Hillsborough Memorial, which was relocated to the same warehouse the gates will be kept in earlier in February.

The Hillsborough Memorial has also been carefully removed and stored with the Shankly Gates 

Shankly won three First Division titles, two FA Cups, four Charity Shields and a UEFA Cup at the Reds

'We’ve had no problems at all, except for the wind, it was blowing them everywhere when we were trying to move them.'

Work on the Main Stand began earlier this year and will increase the capacity of the ground by about 8,500 to 54,000.

The stand itself will become one of the largest all-seater stands in Europe.

Liverpool say 'the design will ensure that the unrivalled atmosphere and spirit of Anfield is retained.'

Under Shankly, the Reds won three First Division Championships, two FA Cups, four Charity Shields and one UEFA Cup, before he retired after 15 years, handing the reigns over to Bob Paisley.
