A Melbourne taxi driver has been left terrified and shaken after a violent bashing attack where his passengers tried to run over him in his own cab before smashing into a pole.

The 30-year-old driver named Hamid said his male and female passengers became aggressive towards him when he dropped them off in north east Melbourne and asked for the fare.

'He hit me two or three times on my face and on my head,' the father-of-two told reporters. 'They started punching on my face and on my head, and he tried to kill me.'

A Melbourne taxi driver was attacked by two passengers on Saturday morning after asking for the fare

Police have released the images of the offenders aged in their mid to late 20s. A woman of Caucasian appearance, thin build with long blonde hair and who was a light-coloured woollen jumper at the time, and a man described as being of European appearance, solid build and wearing a light-coloured vest, white t-shirt and jeans

The driver picked up the couple in Brunswick Street, near the intersection of Johnson Street, in Fitzroy, about 1.20am on Saturday morning.

Driving them about 12 kilometres to an apartment block in Gotha St, Heidelberg Heights, Hamid dropped the passengers off just before the intersection of Bell Street, but the pair said they had no money for the fare.

At this point the passengers got out of the vehicle and told the driver they would get money from inside a block of nearby flats.

Hamid asked them to leave something as security, which saw the male passenger react aggressively - repeatedly punching Hamid to the face and demanding his wallet.

Refusing to hand over his wallet, the driver got out of the car and ran toward Bell Street.

'I was just trying to save myself in that time,' he said. 'I'm just afraid because he tried to kill me.'

'He was aggressive and saying many things, I couldn't remember all those things because I was in shock.'

At this time, the male and female got into the taxi and drove it toward the victim.

The offenders then drove the taxi away, before crashing into a pole on Upper Heidelberg Road near Montgomery Street and fled before police arrival.

The taxi driver was treated by paramedics for facial swelling at the scene but did not require hospitalisation.

Hamid said he was traumatised by the experience and genuinely feared for his life.

'I was so afraid what will happen – when I called triple-0, I was really upset, crying, I couldn't breathe in that time,' he said.

Detective Senior Constable Brendan Riddell described the incident as frightening. 'It's quite brutal,' he told reporters.

'The taxi driver's just trying to go about his work and he's been set upon by these two offenders.'

Police have released security footage in a bid to identify the offenders, aged in their mid to late 20s.

The cab driver picked the passengers up in Brunswick Street, in Fitzroy, north east of Melbourne CBD about 1.20am on Saturday morning

The man is described as being of European appearance and solid build and was wearing a light-coloured vest, white t-shirt and jeans.

The woman is descried as being Caucasian, thin build with long blonde hair and was a light-coloured woollen jumper.
