Chelsea and Tottenham will fight it out for the season's first piece of silverware in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley on Saturday.

Here, Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp takes a look at the key battles that will decide which part of London brings home the trophy...

Chelsea will line up against London rivals Spurs in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley on Sunday

EDEN HAZARD v KYLE WALKER

Hazard is surely the player Spurs are most scared of — he’s Chelsea’s match-winner. The Belgian has scored in both games against Spurs this season but a third would be the most important. 

Walker is a tremendous athlete who can match him for pace and power. But the runs Hazard makes in behind the full back are brilliant and Walker can sometimes be bamboozled by movement like that. He will need to have the game of his life.

Kyle Walker will be tasked with stopping Eden Hazard who has scored in both games against Spurs this term

DIEGO COSTA v ERIC DIER

The Chelsea striker has been trying to make it out that he’s being picked on and I can’t stop laughing. He’s an absolute beast and can handle himself. He is a match-winner, Chelsea’s battering ram and focal point and Dier will be up against it. 

Dier is only 21 but he’s quick and strong. Like all young players he has had a few iffy moments and this cup final will be another level up for him. But he’s talented and with a few early touches to calm the nerves, he can compete.

CESC FABREGAS v RYAN MASON

Mason was rested in the Europa League on Thursday and that shows you how highly rated he is by Mauricio Pochettino. The middle of the park is where the game is won and lost and Mason must and can get after Fabregas. He can’t let Fabregas dictate the game, he must hurry him up all the time, make him uncomfortable. 

I like Mason. Some players kick a ball and others pass it. He passes it. He’ll be nervous — I remember cramping up in my first Wembley final — but he is key to Tottenham winning.

Ryan Mason must find a way to stop Cesc Fabregas from dictating the game from midfield

KURT ZOUMA or GARY CAHILL v HARRY KANE

Mourinho has a big decision: the experience of Cahill or Zouma, his new go-to man against Spurs’ biggest weapon. Cahill should have been sent off in the 5-3 defeat by Spurs for kicking out at Kane so I would not be surprised to see Zouma start. His pace and power could see him get the nod. 

I’ll be at Wembley with Sky and I can’t wait to see Kane in this game. He’ll be so excited, dying to show everyone what he can do. If he performs and Tottenham win, he’ll cement his place as an icon at Spurs for years to come.
