A couple with a passion for military history have married in a wartime-style ceremony that was so authentic they even issued guests with ration books at the reception.

Kath and Andrew Hacking married in the quirky 1940s-style ceremony and even walked down the aisle to the theme from the 1955 film the Dam Busters.

Bride Kath, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, wore a traditional 1940s dress while her groom wore a British Army uniform dating back from World War II.

The couple who have been attending 1940s re-enactment events for six years even drove away in an armoured vehicle.

Andy, 47, a self-employed plumber, said: 'The whole thing started off as a bit of a joke.

'We love going to the re-enactments and everything about the 1940s and Kath really wanted an old-fashioned wedding dress.

'But the whole thing snowballed, and before we knew it, we had 150 guests in full 1940s dress.

'Most of the men were in military dress and most of them were British soldiers, but some were Russian, some Australian, and we even had a few German soldiers.

'Most of the guests were fellow re-enacters, but even those who weren't got into the spirit of things and dressed up. It was a really special day.'

Catering manager Kath, 50, walked down the aisle to Louis Armstrong's It's A Wonderful World before headingÂ  out of the church to the Dambusters theme.

The pair, who have been together for 
nine years, held a reception in a marquee at a re-enactment day where 
nearly 500 members of the public joined them to celebrate their special 
day.

The couple's 150 invited guests then received a paper ration book which entitled them to a selection of war time food including corned beef and spam sandwiches

Kath added: 'It was a wonderful day, and we're so glad that so many people were able to share it with us.

'We got into the re-enacting about six years ago when we saw a poster advertising an event and we were hooked.

'It's just a really lovely escape from the pressures of modern life.

'It was a really romantic day we couldn't have wished for anything better.'

In style: The couple even drove away from the celebrations in an armoured vehicle
