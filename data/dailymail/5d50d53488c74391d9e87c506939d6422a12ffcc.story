Germany were intent on enjoying themselves as they arrived back in Berlin to celebrate winning the World Cup - even pre-rehearsing a hilarious routine to delight supporters.

Around half-a-million fans flocked to Brandenburg Gate in the country's capital on Tuesday morning to greet their heroes, and were in for a surprise.

Thomas Muller, Mats Hummels, Erik Durm and Christoph Kramer looked to be striding out on to the podium alone, but captain Philipp Lahm was behind them, unseen.

Lahm crouched and revealed the shimmering World Cup as the other four fell to the ground in a move to draw huge cheers.

The Germany captain had earlier led his champions from the aircraft shortly after 10am local time, followed by Bastian Schweinsteiger who was wearing the country's flag, and the team were greeted by excited fans trying to get a glimpse of the trophy as they made their way through the airport.

During their 11-hour flight it was reported in Bild that the Germany players managed to get some rest. After partying on Monday to celebrate their fourth World Cup triumph, there was a reported hour delay after a baggage carrier had touched the plane.

Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil was delighted to touch down on home turf, and said on his Twitter account: 'back in the country of the world champions.'

Thousands of supporters lined the Fan Mile in the centre of Berlin as the team and manager Joachim Low, who were all dressed in identical winners T-shirts, took to an open-top truck to parade the World Cup trophy and show off their medals on their homecoming.

On the 
side of the black Mercedes truck was painted the years of Germany's 
triumphs at the biggest tournament in world football, '1954, 1974, 1990,
 2014!'

The president of the German Football Association (DFB) Wolfgang Niersbach was excited about the reception for the squad and he said in an interview with ARD: 'This is a dream. Seeing this enthusiasm. I do not know what in our country more can trigger this sense of belonging as this World Cup.

'Our players are looking forward incredibly to enjoy this moment.'

Germany coach Low held the trophy aloft to the sound of much cheering and applause as the truck slowly made its way through the thick crowds with hundreds of fans following behind as they hailed their heroes.

The team were euphoric as they were welcomed by the Berlin crowds and Ozil tweeted again and posted some photographs of the cheering crowds beside the River Spree, and said: 'what a crowd! unbelievable!'

The sea of fans were chanting for their heroes 'Deutschland, Deutschland, Deutschland!' as the truck continued through the city streets with no sign of the road or pavements, just people celebrating as they made their way to the Brandenburg Gate.

'It's beautiful. It feels very good, it's all gone perfectly for us,' Andre Schurrle told sportbild.bild.de. Toni Kroos added: 'It was a great World Cup.'
