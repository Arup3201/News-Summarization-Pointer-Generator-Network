A woman lost 12 stone after choosing to have two thirds of her stomach removed to allow her to fulfil her dream of having children.

Lisa Durrant, 33, of Burwell in Cambridgeshire, opted for a sleeve gastrectomy after years of dieting and even gastric band surgery failed to work.

Miss Durrant opted for the irreversible procedure after she found her size was causing her health problems and, crucially, affecting her fertility.

Lisa dropped from 21 stone and a size 28 (left) to a slim 9 stone and size 10 (right)

After 
having the gastrectomy done privately, her weight more than halved from 
21 stone to nine stone in just over two and half years - and she is now 
trying for a baby.

Lisa
 said: 'It may be permanent, but I have never regretted the surgery and I
 don’t think I ever will. I feel so much better now and I can’t wait to 
have children.'

Miss Durrant said the weight piled on as she turned to treats for comfort food during her teenage years.

She
 said: 'I don’t ever remember being a normal-sized child - I’ve always 
been larger. At school I was bullied and it was a vicious circle. I ate 
because I felt sad, but as my weight increased, I got bullied more.'

Lisa used to use food as a form of comfort; treating herself to junk food like crisps and sweets

Miss Durrant would snack on multipack crisps and Haribo sweets as a form of comfort.

She tried diets but could not shift the weight. As she grew older, she became increasingly concerned about how her failing health was affecting her ability to have children.

She stopped having regular periods at the age of 17, in what doctors suspected was a case of obesity affecting ovary function.

She said: 'I’d really wanted kids since I was 19 and if I hadn’t been able to have them I would have been devastated.'

In 2007 Miss Durrant even had a gastric band fitted, but it was removed in late 2010 after doctors found it was corroding away, putting her stomach wall at risk of serious damage.

In August 2011 she opted for a sleeve gastrectomy which involved having two thirds of her stomach removed through keyhole surgery at a hospital in Australia, where she was then living.

Lisa began dropping a stone a month after her drastic sleeve gastrectomy, which reduced the size of her stomach by two thirds (left, before her weight loss, right, today)

The operation, which was covered by her private health insurance, cost £4,000.

She said: 'The outcome was permanent and there was no going back once I’d made the decision.

'It was a big decision, but I was so unhappy being overweight that I knew it was what I needed to do.

'I couldn’t sit in cinema seat and plane seats were always a problem. It was so embarrassing and I felt so self-conscious.

'I didn’t worry about the operation, I was more worried that my obesity would kill me. If I went on a short walk I would be out of breath. If I went up a few steps then I would start to feel extremely unwell.

Breakfast: McDonald's muffin

Lunch: Large sandwiches and cakes

Dinner: Whole Pizza Hut pizza

Snacks: Crisps, sweets and chocolate

Breakfast: Small bowl of cereal or fruit

Lunch: Ham salad wrap

Dinner: Vegetable and meat casserole

Snacks: Very occasional sweets

'Every single day I wished there was something I could do about it.. The surgery seemed like the only possible option.'

From the date of the operation to today, Miss Durrant has lost more than 12 stone, and her dress size has shrunk from a size 28 to a size 10.

Before beginning her weight loss, she typically ate McDonald’s muffins for breakfast then large meaty sandwiches and cakes for lunch. For dinner she would often eat whole Pizza Hut pizzas to herself and would snack on crisps, sweets and chocolate.

Today, she typically eats a small bowl of cereal or fruit for her breakfast.

For lunch she will still have a ham salad wrap or pasta but it will be spread out throughout the day as she can no longer eat it in one sitting.

She said: 'At first it felt a bit strange as I was used to being able to eat a whole pizza. Now I eat two slices and feel stuffed.'

Losing so much weight caused Miss Durrant's periods started again and is planning on having children with her new partner

Miss Durrant found that her weight loss began gradually but soon she was regularly shedding more than a stone each month.

She said: 'The decision was definitely the right one. If I had to make the decision all over again I would.'

With her new-found confidence, Miss Durrant decided to leave an unhappy life in Australia and move back to the UK to be with her family.

She said her brother did not recognise her when he picked her up from the airport.

She said: 'I went to my cousin’s house for a visit not long after I got home, and she asked who I was.

'Even now, family members have to double-take. They are so happy for me because I’m healthier and happier.'

Since moving back to the UK she has found a new partner who loves her new thinner form. Losing so much weight caused Miss Durrant’s periods started again and the couple are planning on having children together.

After losing weight so quickly she had been left with a lot of excess skin which she is planning to have removed by doctors.

She said: 'I feel absolutely fantastic, I have a lot more confidence than I ever had before.'
