A worker at PC World planned a £38,000 robbery because his mum told him to, a court heard.

Anthony Bradley, 22, succumbed to 'mummy pressure', and recruited a gunman for an inside job at the store in Kingston, Surrey, where both he and his mum Mina Bradley worked.

Mina, 52, was assistant manager at the PC World store in Kingston, Surrey, where her son was a shop assistant.

Described as a trusted 
employee, she pressured Anthony into finding gunmen to rob the Fife Road 
store on January 16 in an error-strewn raid.

She was jailed for seven years for conspiracy to rob and her son was given three years, also for conspiracy to rob, at Kingston Crown Court

Mr Bradley recruited gunman Michael Ward, 20, who was sentenced to five years for robbery and possessing an imitation firearm, and another unidentified accomplice.

When they were arrested Ward and Mr Bradley admitted their guilt, but the mother-of-three continued to deny involvement in the raid, until she realised her son planned to testify against her.

Recorder Roberts said it was 'regrettable in the extreme' that Miss Bradley had involved her son, describing her as the 'chief instigator and planner'.

Handing the prison term to Miss Bradley, of Robin Hood Way, Sutton, Mr Roberts said: 'I am satisfied that you were the chief instigator and planner in this very serious crime.

'You used your trusted position at this shop to steal a large sum of money, putting staff members, to whom you owed a duty of care, through a dreadful experience.

'They are the real victims of this crime, who, not knowing this was an inside job, believed their lives were at risk.'

The court heard how Miss Bradley handed over security information to the robbers, told them when the store would be holding the most cash, and used her influence to change staff rotas on the day of the raid.

The robbers threatened staff with an imitation Uzi sub-machine gun, snatched nearly £38,000 in cash, then fled the scene separately having argued over whether to steal laptops.

Ward, described as 'not a deep thinker' was caught four days later trying to leave Holyhead ferry port in Wales to get to his native Ireland.

DC Matt Benedict of Barnes Flying Squad said Miss Bradley abused her position as assistant manager and betrayed her son by involving him in the raid.

'Mina Bradley, in particular, played a pivotal role in the planning and organisation of this armed robbery. As a mother, she betrayed her son Anthony, manipulating him until he was forced to capitulate and help execute her plans. Sadly he now has to face the reality of his actions and faces time behind bars.

'Michael Ward displayed his ruthlessness when it came to his part in committing this armed robbery. He and his accomplice traumatised staff and subjected them to a terrifying ordeal.'
