The modern Formula One steering wheel weighs 1.5kg, costs £30,000 and takes six weeks to build. It allows the driver to change the behaviour of their cars at the flick of a button. 

Each driver has a specific design suited to their own preferences, from the space behind the wheel to change gear, the molded grips or the colour of buttons on their dash. 

Lewis Hamilton’s favoured colour, for instance, is purple. Here, Sportsmail's Phil Duncan takes a closer look at Hamilton’s title-winning steering wheel.
