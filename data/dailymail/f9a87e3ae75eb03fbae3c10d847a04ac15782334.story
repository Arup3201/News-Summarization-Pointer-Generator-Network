Bad decision: Half of Britain's gold reserves were sold for £2bn in 1999 by Gordon Brown (file picture)

The gold reserves held by Britain that were disastrously sold off by Gordon Brown would be worth six times as much today at £11bn, the Chancellor revealed in his budget speech today.

George Osborne said that the Government had been rebuilding the country's reserves of the precious metal after former chancellor Brown sold them in 1999.

The decision to sell half of Britain's reserves when the price of gold was at a 20-year low low caused stinging criticism of the man who succeeded Tony Blair as prime minister.

Brown sold the gold for £2bn when gold was valued at just $300 an ounce. The sale came shortly before bullion started a blistering rally that took prices to a record high of $1,920.30 an ounce in September 2011.

The same gold reserves would be worth £11bn today.

The Chancellor said in his budget speech today: 'We are also taking the opportunity to rebuild Britain's reserves, which had fallen to historically low levels.

'I can confirm our gold holdings have risen in value to £11 billion. This does not include the 400 or so tonnes of gold sold a decade ago for £2 billion, and which would now be worth six times that at over £13 billion pounds.

Mr Osborne's jibe in the House of Commons was greeted raucously from Conservative ministers as embarrassed Labour MPs could only look on.

When asked if the Treasury had plans to increase the amount of gold Britain holds, currently 9.975 million ounces, valued at 11 billion pounds ($17.44 billion),  unsurprisingly the spokesman said: 'There aren't.'    

The gold price, which has risen by around 6 percent this year, was up 0.1 percent today at $1,652.90

Mr Brown's decision to sell the gold when he was Chancellor is regarded as one of the Treasury's worst financial mistakes and has cost taxpayers almost £7 billion.

Despite repeated campaigns to shed light on the issues, Mr Brown and the Treasury have repeatedly refused to give any information about the sale amid allegations that warnings were ignored.

The issue also blighted Labour's general election campaign and underpinned claims that they had mismanaged the economy.

George Osborne said at the time: 'Gordon Brown's decision to sell off our gold reserves at the bottom of the market cost the British taxpayer billions of pounds. It was one of the worst economic judgements ever made by a chancellor.

'The British public have a right to know what happened and why so much of their money was lost. The documents should be published immediately.'

It has been suggested that Mr Brown forced through the sale of the reserves despite serious concerns from the Bank of England.

It is not thought that senior Bank experts were even consulted about the decision, which was driven through by a small group of senior Treasury aides close to Mr Brown. These included Ed Balls and Ed Miliband.
