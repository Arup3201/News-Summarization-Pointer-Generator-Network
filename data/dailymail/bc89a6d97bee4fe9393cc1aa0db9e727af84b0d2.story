Tragedy: Gabrielle Molina, 12, took her life after enduring relentless online bullying, family said

Police have confirmed that the 12-year-old girl who was found hanging in her Queen's home last week committed suicide because she was being bullied at school. 

Gabrielle Molina was a seventh grader at a local middle school where her classmates would call her a slut and a whore, her family said last week.

Police commissioner Raymond Kelly recently confirmed that she left behind a suicide note that referred to the bullying.

Cops are investigating whether Gabrielle was a victim of online harassment as well as face-to-face abuse and took two computers from her home.

Gabby’s fellow students at Jean Nuzzi Intermediate School 109 in Queens who sent the messages are currently under investigation, according to the New York Daily News.

Her 15-year-old sister 
found the young girl hanging in the bedroom they shared at their home.

She said later that Gabrielle told her about the bullying but made her swear to secrecy that she would not tell their mother.

However her parents knew she had been having some trouble with bullies at school, including a fistfight earlier this spring. But the full extent has only emerged after her death.

Her father George told the New York Post that
they called her a slut and a whore and told her she looked like she 
suffered from Down syndrome - and that a recent breakup pushed her over 
the edge.

'I was trying
to comfort her because she was getting weak,' said the distraught 
father, who was seen sobbing outside the family's home on Thursday. 'I 
wanted to make her happy.'

She
was also teased after a sickening video entitled 'Gabby's Fight' 
appeared on YouTube, friends said. It showed the girl, who was barely 5ft tall, being beaten up by a former friend.

George
Molina said that the school failed to address the incident quickly 
enough and the footage was not immediately removed from the internet.

Loss: Schoolmates bullied the young girl for her looks and because she self harmed, her friends said

After the fight a school counselor set up a meeting with Gabby's parents and between the girls, who made up, her mother said.

Fellow students also knew that Gabby was self harming, and also teased her for that, friends told the New York Daily News.

A close friend of Gabby's, Samantha Martin, told the Daily News that she cut herself a lot and some of it stemmed from problems at home.

'They had a lot of problems, they fought a lot,' she said. 'But she always seemed happy. (But) people knew she was cutting herself.'

But Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott
said that a preliminary investigation did not show any 
serious bullying problems at the school - which its students denied.

Gabby 'said that she wanted to move 
schools because she felt uncomfortable. People wanted to jump her and 
people bothered her,' her friend Samantha Martin, 12, told the Daily News.

Scene: Gabby's sister returned to their family home on Wednesday and found the girl hanged in their room

Police questioned students at the school last Thursday but no charges have been brought.

Gabby's mother said that the girl had not come down for school in the morning on Wednesday and that her door was locked, which was not unusual.

Her grandparents knocked on the door throughout the day but, when she did not respond, they thought she was sleeping.

But when her sister returned home from school, she forced the door open and found her body.

In a letter she left behind, Gabby apologized to her family - her sister, 21-year-old brother Geonel, and parents George and Glenda - for taking her life.

Family members said she had wanted to
become a lawyer. Her aunt, Irma Molina, told the Post that she 
didn't understand the young girl's death.

'She's very quiet, very friendly,' she said. 'She wanted
to dance and sing. She’s so young.'

'Cruel': Students at her school, IS 109, posted a video of her being beaten up online, friends said

Neighbors also told the Post of their shock at the death of the young girl, whose family has lived at the home for nearly 10 years.

'They're just a wonderful family,' said a neighbor. 'It's just so sad. I don't know how they are going to get by.'

The National Crime Prevention Council notes that 43 per cent of teens are subject to cyberbullying, and there have been recent, high profile cases.

In one heartbreaking story, 15-year-old Felecia Garcia killed herself last October after fellow students allegedly posted a video of her having sex with members of the football team.

She was branded a 'slut' and humiliated by her classmates online, eventually taking her life by jumping in front of a train.
