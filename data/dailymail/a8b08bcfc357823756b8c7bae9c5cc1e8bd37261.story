Spy: John Bingham was an MI5 agent who tricked British fascists into revealing their allegiances in the Second World War

A Second World War intelligence agent who inspired fictional spy George Smiley 'hated everything' about how author John le Carré portrayed the secret services, it has been claimed.

John Bingham, an MI5 agent, exposed Nazi sympathisers in Britain by convincing them he was a German double agent. After gaining the trust of undercover fascists, he convinced them to reveal secrets which were fed back to the intelligence services.

Mr le Carré, whose works include The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, revealed in 1999 that Smiley was inspired by Bingham, who had been his boss at MI5.

George Smiley features in eight of le Carré's novels and was played by Gary Oldman in the 2011 film adaptation of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.

The true extent of Mr Bingham's espionage was revealed just days ago when the National Archives declassified a cache of documents 25 years after his death.

The files show how he was able to root out traitors among the aristocracy and intellectual elite, including worrying links between Nazi sympathisers and a Cabinet Minister.

Mr Bingham was also passed plans for a jet aircraft and even an amphibious tank by people who believed they were helping the Germans.

But the spy, who went on to become a celebrated author himself, turned on his former colleague and friend Mr le Carré and grew to detest what he wrote about the British intelligence services, it was claimed today.

Lord Lexden, a Conservative peer and historian, said that 'modest hero' Mr Bingham 'was not treated as respectfully as he deserved by his protégé  John le Carré... he was hurt by the portrayal of his secret world in the novels'.

In a letter published today by the Daily Telegraph, Lord Lexden wrote that Mr Bingham once said that Mr le Carré 'was my friend, but I deplore and hate everything he has done and said against the intelligence services'.

The declassified files do not refer to Mr
 Bingham directly, but reveal the activities of 'Jack King', which was 
the spy's pseudonym.

The declassified files do not name John Bingham directly, but refer to 'Jack King'.

Although the intelligence services would never confirm the true identity of its agents, the moniker would fit with an old tradition for MI5 operatives to chose pseudonyms which sound similar to their real names.

This was done to protect the agents in case somebody accidentally used their real name - which they could pretend had simply been misheard.

Reports on the files published earlier in the week tell how, from 1942, Mr Bingham had direct contact with six men and women who believed he was working for the Gestapo.

They in turn passed on information on 'probably hundreds' of Nazi sympathisers int he country. He was also able to gather information on British Union of Fascists founder Sir Oswald Mosley.

Diaries of Mr Bingham's MI5 superiors speaking of plans to take key British fascist figures to court on the basis of the evidence gathered, but the agency appears to have changed its mind when it became obvious that the trial could not proceed without calling on Mr Bingham as a witness, blowing his cover.

Mr Bingham, an impoverished Irish aristocrat also known as the 7th Baron Clanmorris, also worked as a reporter and an author, penning 17 novels himself. He died in 1988.
