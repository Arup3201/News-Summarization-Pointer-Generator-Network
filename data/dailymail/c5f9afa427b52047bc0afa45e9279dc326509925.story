A police force has backtracked and named a retired police officer charged with a £113,000 theft after coming under fire for refusing to do so on policy grounds.

Warwickshire Police performed a U-turn less than 24 hours after claiming their rules had changed in the wake of the Leveson inquiry, and revealed Paul Andrew Greaves, 54, was the subject of the allegations.

A short footnote at the bottom of the press release revealing the charging decision said: ‘Due to a change in policy we no longer release the name of an individual on charge.’

U-turn: Warwickshire Police initially refused to name Paul Andrew Greaves, 54, from Stratford-upon-Avon, after he was charged with a £113k theft from the force's former headquarters

But the force were today slapped down by the Association of Chief Police Officers and their own deputy commissioner.

Greaves was named by the Crown Prosecution Service and police were forced into a humiliating backtrack.

It is a long-standing convention for police to name those they charge with an offence. Until recently, they 
would also routinely name anyone they had arrested if asked.

But
 following the Leveson report into Press standards, forces have begun 
rolling back the public’s right to know who is being arrested.

Chief Constable Andy Trotter, who 
leads for Acpo on media issues, said today that suspects should be named once charged.

'We advise forces, working with 
the Crown Prosecution Service, to name those who have been charged and 
that position will not change,' he said.

'When an individual has been arrested
 our current guidance is not to name them and we will only release the 
name for the prevention or detection of crime, or if there is a serious 
public interest.'

Lord Justice Leveson's report called for a ban on the Press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested

To the horror of free speech 
campaigners, senior officers have drawn up plans which would ban the 
Press and public being told the identity of anyone arrested.

Lord
 Justice Leveson’s report called for a ban on the Press or public being 
told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested.

However,
 the refusal to name a suspect who has been charged and may already be 
in police custody goes a significant step further in wrapping the 
judicial system in a cloak of secrecy.

The
 naming of suspects who have been charged with criminal offences – and 
who will stand trial in court –  is widely seen as an essential bulwark 
against arbitrary arrest and detention.

'We advise forces, working with 
the Crown Prosecution Service, to name those who have been charged and 
that position will not change'

- Acpo statement after Warwickshire Police refused to name the suspect

Eric Wood, Warwickshire's Deputy 
Police and Crime Commissioner, said that it was in the public interest 
for the suspect to be named.

'Warwickshire Police has a reputation
 for being an open and transparent organisation and I am extremely 
disappointed at what has transpired in the last 24 hours,' he said.

'I was very surprised to hear about 
this sudden change of policy yesterday evening, and immediately 
contacted Deputy Chief Constable Neil Brunton on behalf of the 
Commissioner to discuss our concerns. We have since had a number of 
robust conversations.

'Both the Commissioner and I firmly 
believe that it is in the public interest that this individual is named.
 He is charged with a serious offence.

'The Commissioner is demanding a full
 and frank report on all of the circumstances that led to this decision,
 and we will be seeking assurances that in future all national 
guidelines are adhered to.

'We are committed to ensuring that 
Warwickshire Police operate in an open and transparent manner, and that 
lessons have been learned from the mistakes of the last 24 hours.'

Last night the Warwickshire force’s acting deputy chief constable Neil Brunton defended their policy.

But today the force issued a statement admitting that they were wrong and named Greaves.

'As a result of concerns raised after publication of a press release regarding a man charged with theft, we accept that our decision not to name him was wrong and inconsistent with the current national guidance,' it read.

'We will now be adopting the national ACPO guidance in respect to naming individuals on charge. We apologise that our previous approach has not been consistent with this.

'Paul Andrew Greaves, a 54-year-old retired police officer, has been charged with the theft of £113,000 from the former Warwickshire Police headquarters at Leek Wootton.'
