A woman went on a spending spree treating herself to a breast enhancement, motorbike and new car after her husband embezzled £100,000 from a building company, a court heard today.

Rhianna Thomas, 24, allegedly spent more than £4,000 of the embezzled cash on breast surgery after her new husband Arron Thomas, 32, stole £99,243.62 from building company Grafton Merchanting.

Today, prosecutor Robin Griffiths told Oxford Crown Court who Thomas drew up fake invoices and wrote cheques out under his wife's maiden name of Tucker - the same name as one of Grafton's suppliers.

The jury was told that while Arron Thomas had admitted the fraud, his wife denies the charges against her.

They heard that after the money started to flow into her account, Rhianna Thomas visited the Make Yourself Amazing (MYA) cosmetic surgery centre in Birmingham and booked a £4,250 operation to enhance her breast size.

Finance director of MYA Cosmetic 
Surgery, Martina Jackson, told the jury her company had performed the 
defendant's breast enlargement.

'She wanted to have the operation as soon as possible and she paid the full amount for the procedure,' she said.

Outlining the case, Mr Griffiths said that Arron Thomas registered with recruitment agency Hayes and requested work in an accounts department.

He said Thomas was found work as a purchase ledger clerk at Grafton Merchanting in Oxford, working 37 and a half hours per week at an hourly rate of £8.34.

Mr Griffiths said: 'The trial will be concerned with very large sums of money and the prosecution draws attention to the relatively modest scale of his legitimate earnings during that six-month period [of his employment].

'The way it is believed to have worked is that Grafton Merchanting would submit weekly time sheets regarding hours he actually worked.

'Hayes paid him by bank transfer into the account he nominated which was a NatWest account held in the name 'R Tucker'.

'It turns out R Tucker stood for Rhianna and the surname to which she had at the time. It was later to become Thomas when she married Arron in April 2011.'

Invoices were made to a legitimate and entirely innocent company named Tuckers Glass and Windows. This totalled £36,679.98 on January 31, 2011.  Three other payments of £8,505, £29,895.67 and £24,162.97 then followed.

The prosecutor added: 'Suppliers send an invoice to Graftons and any adjustment made if necessary before it's processed and then a cheque is printed and signed off. It is placed into an envelope and placed in the post room ready for dispatch.

'After Arron Thomas left that employment it was discovered that he had abused his position of trust there by manually raising requests for payments on the computer to a company which had submitted no invoices for the kind of sums of money for which he then used the system to issue cheques.

'This created a cover for the issue 
of the cheque in these very large sums. The money - £99,243.62 - was 
paid into the same NatWest bank account held in the name of R Tucker - 
the name of this defendant.'

Tuckers Glass and Windows was a small supplier to Graftons who usually submitted invoices for under £100.

Mr
Griffiths said the couple embarked on a mammoth spending spree once the
illicit funds were in Rhianna Thomas' account, buying a Suzuki GSXR600 motorbike and Volvo C70 coupe.

'Virtually all the money was spent in a remarkably short amount of time,' he said.

Rhianna
and Arron Thomas got married at Eynsham Hall in Oxfordshire on April 
29, 2011 - the same day heir to the throne Prince William wed Kate 
Middleton at Westminster Abbey.

The jury at Oxford Crown Court heard that Rhianna Thomas denies the charges of possessing and transferring criminal property

The following January, they were arrested at their Oxfordshire home and later charged by police with a string fraud-related offences.

In a pre-prepared statement handed to 
police upon her arrest, the defendant said: 'Arron has had use of my 
personal bank account for most of our relationship.

'At
times he has had total control. I was aware large amounts had been paid
into my account. I was told by Arron that these were loans.'

The statement went on: 'I
have not had any involvement in these amounts being paid into my 
account in any way. Control and management of these loans was entirely 
the responsibility of Arron Thomas.

'I was not aware of any thefts of cheques at any time.'

The jury heard that Arron Thomas had already admitted four counts of fraud and three counts of transferring criminal property. He will be sentenced by a judge at the end of his wife's trial.

Rhianna Thomas denies four counts of possessing criminal property and three counts of transferring criminal property between February and April, 2011.

The couple, from Abingdon, are on conditional bail and the three-day trial, before Recorder Philip Brook Smith, continues.
