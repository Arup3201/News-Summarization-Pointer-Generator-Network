Charged: Jennifer Fichter, 29, confessed to police that she had had sex with her 17-year-old student for four months, falling in love with him and having an abortion

A Florida teacher who had a four month affair with an underage student and aborted his child left her previous job after being investigated for another inappropriate relationship with a teen boy.

Jennifer Fichter was said to have been infatuated with the eighth grade student and was suspended from her job while an investigation was launched in 2008.

A 40 page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him.

She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’

Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night.

When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’

The report said Fichte and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed.

Fichter resigned from Robinswood Middle School in Orange County in the fall of 2008 after administrators suspended her.

Fichter had reportedly told another teacher that a 14-year-old student 'makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes'

An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy. No charges were ever filed against the 29 year old in the 2008 case.

But she is now in jail after being accused of having sex with a minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck.

Police said she confessed to a love affair with a 17-year-old student and even claimed she got pregnant with his child but had an abortion.

Ficher, who worked at the Central Florida Aerospace Academy was charged with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor. The teen has not been identified.

According 
to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse began in November when the 
pair had sex in the early morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup 
truck.

The
 teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the 
parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New 
Tampa Highway.

He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents.

The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27.

When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'.

Police said the mum confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter.

The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long.

The mother also agreed to speak to Fichter and record the conversation for investigators.

During the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the teen's child and had an abortion. Fichter also said she was in love with the student and wanted to continue seeing him.

'The victim's mother discovered this relationship after reviewing text messages from her son and she asked that Fichter respond to her residence to talk,' a Lakeland police statement said, according to Orlando Sentinel.

'According to the victim's mother, Fichter admitted to the sexual encounters and professed her love for him.'

Fichter was arrested at her Davenport home soon after the conversation, and booked at the Polk County Jail.
