The Home Office squandered a staggering £347million on a botched IT programme to process immigrants’ paperwork, a damning report reveals today.

Ministers introduced the flagship Immigration Case Work (ICW) project in 2010 to make it easier for officials to deal with asylum, visas and residency applications by foreigners.

But despite investing so much taxpayers’ money in the programme, it was axed in August last year – after just three years – as a resounding failure.

It ‘delivered significantly less than planned’ prompting officials to finally pull the plug on the scheme, says the National Audit Office (NAO).

The spending watchdog said the failed programme was practically ‘unusable’ and delays and glitches meant it only ever worked for student visas.

The computer system regularly ‘froze’, became unstable, and was incapable of linking with other Government systems.

The embarrassing report, published this morning, reveals staff in UK Visas And Immigration and Immigration Enforcement still work from old-fashioned paper files which increases the risk of mistakes.

The money wasted could have paid for the starting salaries of 15,000 new police recruits at a time when the number of officers is falling.

Home Office chiefs are now introducing a new IT programme, called Immigration Platform Technologies (IPT), which is costing the public another £209million.

But ministers are expected to incur extra costs to maintain the older system - which is due to expire in early 2016 - until the new technology is ready to launch, the Nation Audit Office concluded.

The extraordinary sums wasted will fuel concerns the under-fire department has failed to get a grip on its finances.

The NAO’s latest report focuses on two of the Home Office directorates which were created following the break-up of the beleaguered UK Border Agency.

But it said Home Secreatry Theresa May’s decision to split the former UK Border Agency because of its ‘closed, secretive and defensive culture’ had failed to result in widespread improvements.

UK Visas And Immigration deals with 3.5million applications a year from foreigners wanting to visit and stay in the UK. Immigration Enforcement is tasked with getting people who do not have permission to stay here to leave.

The NAO said the agencies, which have a 1.8billion a year budget, were still dealing with a backlog of 301,000 cases – including at least 31,000 pre-dating 2007.

However, it said there had been ‘no significant performance falls’ since Home Secretary Theresa may broke up the UK Border Agency in February 2012.

But NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘We would have expected greater progress by now though in tackling the problems we identified in 2012 in areas such as specific backlogs and IT.’

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘We abolished the UK Border Agency because it was weak and could not cope with the uncontrolled immigration we saw under the previous government – it was symptomatic of the chaotic system we inherited. This report shows the decision to split up UKBA was the right one.’
