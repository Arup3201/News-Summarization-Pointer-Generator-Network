Accused: Sahar Thabit, 35, pictured, allegedly heated up a kitchen knife on the stove before branding her daughter in three places

A South Florida mother has been charged with child abuse after she burned her daughter's arms with a hot knife because she refused to marry her cousin.

The disturbing case of honor violence was reported to police by the 17-year-old's school, South Broward High, after her friend told teachers that the girl was being abused at home.

According to authorities, Sahar Thabit, 35, heated up a kitchen knife on the stove before branding her daughter in three places after discovering the girl had been talking to a boy in the family's native Yemen over the Internet.

The violence began in early January at the family's West Hollywood home.

The girl told authorities both her parents knew of the incident. The burns - two on her left forearm and one on her upper right arm - caused permanent disfigurement, the police report noted.

The unnamed teen's father was questioned by police and initially claimed she had been burned by a stove. When detectives highlighted that the burns were in three different areas, the father, who hasn't been named, asked for an attorney.

Outside the family house yesterday, the victim's grandfather, Ali Alomari, gave the same explanation, saying, 'She burned herself in the stove.'

He also told NBC Miami: 'I swear to God I didn't see anything.'

The teen is reportedly now living with family friends.

The police report said a friend of the girl reported the abuse to a school administrator, who later called police.

The friend said the teen said her parents became angry when she said she didn't want to marry her cousin in an arranged marriage but wanted to marry a boy she had met on the Internet who lives in Yeman.

The daughter told police she knew talking to the boy online was strictly forbidden in the family's religion, particularly when she had already been promised to another man.

According to the friend, the teen's parents were also verbally and mentally abusive towards her, calling her names like 'whore' and 'slut.' She told police her friend was so upset over her the situation she'd tried to commit suicide.

After conducting a series of interviews with witnesses and the victim, detectives determined Thabit had used the knife to abuse her daughter.

Police weren't able to interview Thabit because she only speaks Arabic, the affidavit said.

She was arrested and later released on $22,500 bond and was ordered to have no contact with her daughter.

The girl's father told NBC Miami over the phone that the family is going through difficult times with the allegations and said he didn't want to comment.

Nova Southeastern University psychology professor Lenore Walker told the TV station that the alleged abuse inflicted on the 17-year-old was similar to an honor killing.

'The rationale is that you're shaming your family by getting involved with a boy or a man who is unacceptable for whatever reason. In this particular case, it's because she was promised to another man and so she talked on the Internet, not even face to face,' Walker said.
