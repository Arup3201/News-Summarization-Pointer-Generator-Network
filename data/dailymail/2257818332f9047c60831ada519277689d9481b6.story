Two children killed in a woman's murderous rampage at the weekend have saved 12 lives after donating their organs.

Hannaleigh Michelle Suttles, eight, and Zachary Lee Smith, 14, were gunned down by Mary Ann Holder, 36, in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Holder shot six people in total - her two sons, niece, nephew, ex-lover and one of her son's girlfriends - before turning the gun on herself.

Hanna, Holder's niece, saved five lives with her organs. Zachary, Holder's son, saved seven.

Holder's nephew Richard Suttles, 17, whom
she was raising with Hanna, remains in critical condition with gunshot 
wounds to the head.

A family spokesman told Fox 8 News that the boy would be taken off life support as soon as matching organ recipients were found.

'Like the saying goes, out of tragedy comes something,' Deputy Durand Dulin of the Guilford County Sheriff's Office told ABC News.

Rampage: Zachary Smith is pictured with his mother, Mary Ann Holder, who shot him and his older brother dead. She also killed her niece and son's girlfriend

Victims: Holder shot her son Robert Smith, 17, and his girlfriend Makayla Woods, 15, as they slept. Makayla's family turned off her life support on Wednesday

'It's just so sad that so many lives had to be taken for someone else to survive. But it is a blessing.'

Holder had been having an affair with
Randy Lamb, 40, for almost four years, and it was coming to a bitter 
end when she arranged to meet him at a community college parking 
lot on Sunday.

Police say she shot him in the shoulder and he was expected to recover.

Holder
then drove to meet Zachary. Nearly half an hour after a 911
call from Lamb's wife, a sheriff's deputy spotted Holder's black SUV.

Holder was found dead inside with a gunshot to the head, and Zachary was critically wounded in the back seat.

Officers then went to her home and found the other victims. They appeared to have been shot while they slept in a bedroom and the home's living room.

Her older son Robert Smith, 17, was found dead at the scene. His girlfriend Makayla Woods, 15, was in critical condition but died Wednesday after her life support was switched off.

Holder left two notes at her home, but police would not reveal the contents.

The day before the rampage, she had given Lamb a $10,000 check written to his wife.

It is believed to be an out-of-court settlement for an 'alienation of
affection' lawsuit the wife threatened to file, a spokesman for the 
Guilford County Sheriffâ€™s Office told the Daily News.

'I worked the day of the shootings and it was hard to conceive that anything like that would happen,' said Dulin.

'There
just aren't any words to thank the recipients. Everybody is really 
praying for the family, not just the victims but the survivors, too. 
They have to live with that -- and it's hard, especially on the kids.'

With
few child deaths and a lack of awareness about organ donation, more 
than 1,900 children under the age of 18 still sit on the national 
waiting list.

More than 110,000 people are waiting for life-saving organ transplants nationally, according to the Carolina Donor Services.

Of those, 3,400 are in North Carolina. More than 28,000 waiting for transplants were helped in 2010.

One person can save up to eight lives with their transplantable organs, which include the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, small intestines.

Tissue donations can benefit up to 50 people.

When Congresswoman
Gabrielle Giffords was shot last year, the youngest vicitim, 
nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green donated her organs in one of the most high-profile cases of its kind.

The organs saved the life of a little girl in Boston and brought sight to two other children in Arizona.

'It was a blessing when we heard about the children,' her mother Roxanna Green told ABCNews.com last year.

'It gives us some comfort that Christina would have wanted this. She didn't think twice about this.

'We are so honored we could help these children. It can bring meaning and comfort at a time of incredible loss.'
