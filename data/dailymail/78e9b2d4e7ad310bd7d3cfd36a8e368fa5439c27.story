A 77-year-old driver has died after his car was struck by a rush-hour passenger train this morning.

The crash happened at about 9.15am on the line at the rural Ivy Lea level crossing at Scampston, near Malton in North Yorkshire.

The car was hit by the 8.48am Scarborough to Liverpool Lime Street First TransPennine Express service. Although there were no reported passenger injuries, the train driver was treated for shock.

A man has been killed after a smash between a train and a car near a level crossing in Yorkshire this morning

Wreckage: A blue car lies on its side at the scene of the smash at Scampston, North Yorkshire

Shocking incident: What looked like a car's boot door appeared to be attached to the side of the train today

Aftermath: Mangled wreckage of the car can clearly be seen hanging off the side of the train

The three-carriage train service 
became stationary around half a mile from where the overturned metallic 
turquoise 4x4 now lies in a field, around 40 yards from the crossing.

Chief
 Inspector Derek O'Mara, of British Transport Police, said: ‘Police got a
 call to report that a vehicle had been struck by a train at Ivy Lea 
crossing near Malton, sadly causing a fatality to an elderly male.

‘The
 point where the road crosses the track is a farm crossing that has 
phones on either side. People have to ring up a signal box to seek 
authority to go across the crossing to make sure it's safe.

‘It's
 too early in the investigation to know whether that has been done or 
not, so that is one of the leads that we'll be looking at in our 
investigation with the coroner.’

There were no reported injuries to passengers on the 8.48am Scarborough to London service

Crash site: The incident happened near a level crossing at Scampton in East Yorkshire, near Malton

On the scene: The crash happened at about 9.15am on the line at the Ivy Lea rail crossing in North Yorkshire

Incident: The train involved was a Scarborough to Liverpool Lime Street TransPennine Express service

He
 added: ‘My thoughts and prayers are with the family. The family have 
not been told at this stage because we are still in the process of 
identifying the male.’

'We knew that something bad had happened. I had been on the train for about 20 minutes and we heard a bump'

Anthony Armstrong, train passenger

The 77-year-old man who died is believed to be a local farmer.

Anthony
 Armstrong, 33, a passenger travelling from Scarborough to York, said: 
‘We knew that something bad had happened. I had been on the train for 
about 20 minutes and we heard a bump.

‘People are a bit shaken up but nobody is hurt.’

Another
 passenger, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was a full train and
 we didn't really know what happened. The police have tried to keep us 
all there but I've walked off.

‘I couldn't stay. I saw the car door hanging off the front carriage but that's all.’

Blocked: Network Rail said all trains to and from Manchester and Liverpool were terminating at York

Ambulance: Although there were no reported passenger injuries, the train driver was treated for shock

Dog
 walker Annie Wilson told BBC Radio York: ‘There was a gentleman in a 
car waiting to turn into Ivy Lea, and I stopped to let him go through 
the crossing - I assume that's where he was going because it's quite a 
narrow track there, and carried on across the field.

'I heard a loud bang, and then heard all the horns of the train'

Annie Wilson, dog walker

‘I
 must have been about 400 metres away and I heard a loud bang, and then 
heard all the horns of the train so I wasn't entirely sure what had 
happened.’

A BTP spokesman said the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and The Office of Rail Regulation had been informed.

Network Rail said all trains to and from 
Manchester and Liverpool were terminating at York and the only route out
 of Scarborough was via Hull.

The subject of safety at rail crossings
 has been to the fore recently, with the issue being investigated, and 
reported on, by the House of Commons Transport Committee.
