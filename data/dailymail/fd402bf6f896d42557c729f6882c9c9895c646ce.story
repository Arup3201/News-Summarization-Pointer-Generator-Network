One of the puppies adopted by Olympic skiier Gus Kenworthy has died before making it to the United States.

A female stray that he named 'Sochi' died before getting medical treatment in America.

Kenworthy grew attached to a family of stray dogs that he found in Sochi ahead of his silver medal win for slopestyle skiing.

Too soon: Gus Kenworthy's would-be adopted dog 'Sochi', seen here with Kenworthy's friend Robin Macdonald, died on March 9 ahead of the scheduled trip back to the US

He stayed behind an extra few days after the Games ended in order to help with the paperwork for bringing the dogs back to America, but he has since returned and his friend Robin Macdonald has taken on the task of bringing the dogs home.

Macdonald, who works as a photographer and cinematographer, announced the death on March 9 on Twitter.

'No words can explain what has happened here, good bye little guy, we will miss you,' he wrote with a picture of him holding Sochi.

'She died, they refused to let me bring her to get treatment,' he clarified in another tweet.

Kenworthy's spokesman Michael Spencer confirmed the dog's death to ABC News.

While one dog did not make it, Macdonald is flying back from Russia with five dogs: Jake, Rosa, Mishka, Stryder and Mom, the mother of the liter.

Kenworthy previously told the Today Show that he will be keeping Rosa and another dog, one will be going to Kenworthy's brother's family and the mother will go to his mom.

Macdonald posted photos of the dog's crates on Wednesday showing them at the airport on their way back to the U.S.

The pups have resulted in a great deal of attention for Kenworthy, the 22-year-old who helped the U.S. sweep the slopestyle event with his silver contribution.

He credited Macdonald with being the one to alert him to the particularly photogenic stray family.

'There were a lot of strays there, but the [ones that I adopted] were living outside the media center. My friend Robin who was out there doing media stuff during the Games saw them and sent me a photo of them because he knows Iâ€™m obsessed with dogs,' Kenworthy told Elle.
