Resilient: Humble water carrier Spyros Louis became a Greek national hero when he won the first modern Olympic marathon in 1896... with a little help from some brandy half-way round

Nowadays, he may have opted for Red Bull or Lucozade.

But back it 1896, the energy-boosting drug of choice that helped a humble water carrier become a national hero came in a rather different form.

While many of his competitors collapsed from exhaustion, Spyros Louis triumphed in the first modern Olympic marathon by sipping brandy half-way round to keep him ahead of the field.

The farmer's son completed the 26-mile race in under three hours - eight minutes ahead of second place.

His remarkable story has come to the world's attention once again after the cup he was awarded sold for a record £541,000 at auction this week.

A Greek charity defied the economic crisis to ensure the trophy would remain in the nation after it was sold by his grandson, also called Spyros Louis.

The sale sent Greek heritage 
organisations into a frenzy as they desperately sought the money to 
prevent the historic relic from leaving the country.

And
despite being gripped by economic hardship, Greek philanthropic 
organisation The Stavros Niarchos Foundation found the funds to outbid 
several international parties.

The £541,250 paid for the trophy was well over the £160,000 estimate and set a world record for a piece of Olympic memorabilia.

The 'Breal Cup' will now be returned to Greece where it will eventually go on public display.

Nicolette Tomkinson, of London 
auctioneers Christie's, said: 'We are delighted that the importance of 
the Breal Cup was recognised by collectors around the world and that it 
will return to be on public display in Greece.

'It is hard to believe that such a small trophy represents so much in sporting and Olympic history.

'A total of six bidders competed for it. The cup was sold for £541,250 to The Stavros Niarchos Foundation via telephone.'

A delighted Mr Louis watched the bidding war unfold over the internet.

He
said: 'I could never have imagined the auction of my grandfather's 
marathon winner's cup would generate such international interest and 
raise such significant funds to secure the future of my family.'

Sought after: A bidding war between six organisations pushed the price way beyond the estimated £160,000 when it went under the hammer at Christie's in London

He added: 'I am overwhelmed by the global admiration felt for my grandfather and his Olympic victory for Greece in 1896.

'I am delighted that the cup will soon be on permanent public display for the whole of Greece and the world to see.

'The cup will be shared with the public and serve as a reminder of our history, heritage and resilient spirit.'

Louis,
a water carrier who worked on his father's farm, came first out of 17 
runners in the inaugural modern Olympic marathon despite coming fifth in
the heats.

He sipped brandy half-way round the 
26-mile course to give him an energy boost while six of his competitors 
collapsed from exhaustion.

His cause was helped further after a seventh runner was disqualified when he travelled by carriage for part of the race.

Louis, then 23, finished in just under three hours - eight minutes ahead of second place and became a national hero.

The Breal Cup was named after French philologist, Michel Breal, who invented the modern marathon.

He was inspired by the tale of Phidippides, a messenger who ran from the town of Marathon to Athens to announce the Athenian victory, in the great Battle of Marathon in 490 BC.

The Stavros Niarchos Foundation was set up in 1996 in honour of the Greek shipping magnate by the same name.
