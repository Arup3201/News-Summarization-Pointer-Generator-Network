A woman was astounded when workmen who came to replace her kitchen floor found a fully plumbed bath tub underneath.

Lynette Musgrave had lived in the house in Halifax, West Yorkshire, for 12 years without realising the bath was there.

It was not even discovered when she had her laminate flooring replaced a year ago, after her washing machine leaked, because it was covered by concrete.

Hidden depths: Lynette Musgrave was shocked when workmen fixing her kitchen floor found a sunken bathtub underneath

It was only when they returned after a second leak made the floor dip in the middle that the fitting was found.

And there was a second surprise for Mrs Musgrave when her insurance company said the bath had caused rot damage, which was not covered by them because it pre-dated the start of her policy.

She was forced to pawn jewellery and her laptop to raise the £900 needed to replace her floor.

'When they told me they had found a bath tub I couldn’t believe it,' she said. 'I had no idea it was there.

'I’ve had to pay two sets of excess to have the insurance company come out and do the work twice, and now they’re refusing to finish it.'

Kitchen calamity: Rosie Kennington had the entire floor cave in when she moved into her new house earlier this year - and her insurance company said she would have to cover the £24,000 herself

Mrs Musgrave said she had suffered stress and lost sleep as a result.

'I’m not looking to get compensation, but I pay building insurance every month and I just want them to replace the floor.'

A spokesman for Swinton confirmed that Mrs Musgrave is liable to pay for the damage herself, but that they would refund the £200 increase in her excess as a 'goodwill gesture'.

In March, Rosie Kennington and her partner experienced a similar shock after moving into their dream home.

Within hours of their arrival, their whole kitchen floor caved in underneath them - and insurance company Direct Line told them they would have to find the £24,000 for repairs themselves.
