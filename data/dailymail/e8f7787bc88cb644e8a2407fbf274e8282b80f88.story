A daring mother-of-two put herself up for sale on eBay in a quest to meet her dream Greek man - but quickly took it down after receiving bids from as far away as Australia.

Lois Curtis, 49, from Haywards Heath, West Sussex, posted the unique advert on Sunday night in the hope a 'rugged, gorgeous, Greek guy' would snap her up.

But the serial eBay user, who has always dreamed of moving to Greece, started getting cold feet after notching up a £205 bid in less than 24 hours.

But the mother-of-two quickly took the post (pictured) when she notched up a £205 bid and attracted men from as far away as Australia

Ms Curtis decided to stop the bidding in its tracks - but is still being contacted by men from Puerto Rico and the U.S.

She told MailOnline: ‘I want to go live and in Greece, it's always been a dream. So my friend Apostolos, who lives over there, said “Put yourself on eBay and I will share the link all over Greece”.

'He has loads of friends so we just thought we would see what happened and see whether anyone was interested, just for a bit of fun. 

‘It was up for one whole evening and one morning too. In that time, I had one bid from Australia and one from Peurto Rico - I was amazed when it got to over £200. It was quite flattering.

‘But, no-one from Greece ended up contacting me - which was kind of the point.'

The tongue-in-cheek advert, entitled 'female size 10', described Ms Curtis as being in 'pretty good condition' with 'good bodywork and a sense of fun'. The advert added: 'Cooks and cleans, no warranty... fuses have been known to blow'.

Ms Curtis, from Haywards Heath, West Sussex, posted the advert on Sunday night but had taken it around 12 hours later 

Despite removing the post, Ms Curtis is still being contacted by men over email, including from the U.S

She also posted accompanying photos, including images of her most recent visit to Athens.

She added: 'It was really a bit tongue-in-cheek to see what would happen. Kind of like online dating I suppose - but I thought I might as well have a bit of fun with it.

'I was hoping for a nice Greek, rugged, gorgeous guy – the sort all women want. A few dates – that sort of thing. Of course, I was collection only and there were no refunds after purchase.

‘We were going to leave it and let the advert run, and just see who came forward. But I just changed my mind.

‘It got to the point where I thought “I have only got two bids” and I had agreed on 20 per cent charges. So I worried I was going to be charged more than I was worth!'

In the tongue-in-cheek advert, entitled 'female size 10', Ms Curtis described how she was in 'pretty good condition' with 'good bodywork and a sense of fun'

But the swift removal of the post has not stopped Ms Curtis being inundated with offers from men around the globe.

She said: ‘Since I’ve taken it down, I’ve had about six or seven people email me, asking if they can still bid. I don’t even know how they managed to get in touch. One was from America and said he had his credit card number ready and could he make a bid. 

‘There’s another guy that’s constantly emailing me – I don’t know where he’s even from.

‘I might do the advert again and this time ask specifically for someone from Greece – it’s tempting.’

Ms Curtis has wanted to move to Greece since she first visited the country five years ago.

While travelling there on her own, she stayed in accommodation run by Captain's Studios & Apartments, where she befriended the owners.

She and the family struck up an unlikely friendship and she now travels to their home near Kavos, Corfu, to visit them as often as she can.

Ms Curtis has even started learning Greek, which she tries to practice when talking to the family over Skype.

It was one of the sons in the family, Apostolos Krosis, who suggested she post the advert. 

She said: 'I’ve wanted to live over there for ages. It's just wonderful. They are like my second family, really. They are lovely people. But I haven’t gone yet because of the economy mainly.’
