Sean Iceton, who committed 250 burglaries before he was 17, has been jailed weeks after being released from a young offenders institution

A teenager who was jailed for breaking into more than 250 homes before he was even 17 has been convicted again for the same crime just weeks after being released from prison.

Sean Iceton, 19, was jailed in 2011 after pleading guilty to a vast number of break-ins and stealing goods worth £740,000 while working as part of a 'feral' gang of young criminals.

Repentant Iceton even took police officers on a tour of Leeds in West Yorkshire to point out all the properties he had targeted and what he had stolen from them.

But just 12 weeks after being released from a young offenders' institution, Iceton, 19, has been convicted of breaking into more homes.

Duncan Ritchie, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court that Iceton and another man targeted a home in Pudsey, Leeds, in February this year.

They stole car keys, house keys, an iPad, iPhone and a handbag.

A tracking device fitted to the iPad led officers to nearby Bramley, where Iceton was arrested.

He pleaded guilty to burglary and asked for seven other offences to be taken into consideration by the court.

Richard Reed, mitigating, said Iceton could not find work as a joiner after being released from prison, so returned to burglary.

Judge David Hatton QC jailed Iceton for two years and four months.

Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Inspector Ian Scott, of North West Leeds police, said: 'Iceton has an absolutely appalling number of crimes to his name and behind each one there is the real human misery that burglars like him cause.'

Two years ago, the thief was part of an organised team which carried out the offences over a 12-month period, using profits to fund drugs and alcohol addictions.

At the time he wrote a letter which stated: 'I am sorry for all the victims. I expect a prison sentence and when I get out I am going to get a job.'
