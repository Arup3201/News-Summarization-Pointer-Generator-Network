Wimbledon Garden by  Charlotte Rowe, in south London, won the Medium Residential Award

The judges said Charlotte Rowe's design had 'good proportions, beautiful site lines and an amazing finish'

The inspiring garden, packed with wild flowers, was awarded the Public or Commercial Outdoor Space award and also honoured with the People's Choice Award. 

The designer used herbaceous planting to accentuate the seasons and attract insects, keeping it full of life.

It was named after Horatio Chapple, who volunteered at the centre in his school holidays, and had come up with the idea for the garden.

He  was tragically killed at the age of 17 by a polar bear but the outpouring of love, goodwill and donations enabled the garden to be created. 

Designer Cleve West listened to patients, nurses, therapist, doctors and managers to help him inform the design of the garden, which opened in September 2012.

Speaking on behalf of the judging panel, Richard Sneesby explained: 'This is what healing gardens should be like.  It has beautiful planting that works with the scale of the building and helps to reconnect people to nature.'
