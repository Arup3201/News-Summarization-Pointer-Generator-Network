Suspect: Li Xiaolon, 27, who worked at the hospital has been arrested by police and is said to have a history of mental illness

A janitor with a history of mental illness stabbed seven people to death at the hospital he worked at in northern China today.

Six nurses and one hospital administrator were among those murdered - with another nurse seriously injured in the rampage, the official Xinhua news agency said.

It is the latest in a string of shocking attacks on medical workers in the last two years - with the health ministry only recently introducing measures to step up security at hospitals.

The tragedy unfolded at 3.30am in the staff quarters of the People’s Liberation Army 281 Hospital in Beidaihe district, Qinhuangdao city - a military sanatorium in the northern province of Hebei.

The district of Beidaihe is 185 miles from Beijing and is highly popular with senior members of the ruling Communist party and was once a favourite of Mao Zedong's.

Police arrested a 27-year-old man  named locally as Li Xiaolon who worked in the institution's canteen.

After the rampage Li returned to his dorm rather than escaping, the Southern Metropolis News reported.

Neighbours in Li's hometown in Xiaoheituo village described him as an 'introvert' who did not 'get along with the crowd'.

The Beijing News said Li had made statements about having a history of mental illness and had received treatment in Beijing and the nearby city of Tangshan in 2006.

'It is initially understood that the suspect did not have any obvious problems with the deceased,' the newspaper said on its website.

Officials said Li had been working away from home for the past six years and returned occasionally to see his parents who are in their 50s and lead humble lifestyles as peasants. 

The case is being handled by Beidaiheo public security bureau. Deputy provincial police chief and deputy mayor, Yang Chunguang, is leading the investigation. The hospital is under the management of Beijing Military Command.

Chinese police officials have increased security at hospitals after a spate of attacks and reportedly begun arming their workers with pepper spray earlier this year.

While the Chinese government has ramped up health spending, hospitals are frequently overwhelmed with patients. 

Doctors are also badly paid, leading to corruption and a suspicion that staff are more interested in making money by prescribing unnecessary drugs and treatment than tending the sick.

It is the latest in a string of shocking attacks on medical workers in the last two years

Many other Chinese people are unable to afford health care despite government efforts to provide a basic safety net, which has also prompted attacks in the past.

Ministry data shows that violent attacks directed at doctors and other health care workers in the form of beatings, threats, kidnappings, verbal abuse and murder reached 17,243 cases in 2010, the latest year for which such figures are available.

China has also seen a spate in knife attacks on children in recent months. 

In October, an eight-year-old boy was stabbed to death and two classmates seriously injured in the eastern province of Jiangxi as they walked home from school.

The town of Beidaihe is located around 185 miles from Beijing and is favoured by senior members of China's ruling Communist party

In September, four children were killed by a man while on their way to school in China's southern Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.

Another knife attack that same month saw three children killed and six people injured in a knife attack at a school in the central Hubei province. 

And in December 2012 twenty-two children were injured by a knife-wielding man at a primary school in central China.

Min Yingjun, 36, stabbed an elderly woman before bursting into Chenpeng Village Primary School in the Henan province yesterday.

Seven of the students, aged between six and 12 years old, were taken to hospital, some with severed fingers and ears.
