Climbdown: Joan Bakewell on BBC1's Panorama. The programme used research supporting the introduction of minimum prices for alcohol which was wrong

BBC bosses have been forced into a humiliating U-turn after wrongly claiming that cracking down  on cheap alcohol would save the lives of tens of thousands of pensioners.

They have admitted that a Panorama investigation into alcohol abuse and the elderly used research supporting the introduction of minimum prices which was later discovered to be wrong.

The BBC1 programme, called Old, Drunk And Disorderly?, claimed the lives of 50,000 pensioners would be saved across England over ten years if a price limit were brought in.

Scotland is to introduce a minimum price of 50p per unit for alcohol next year.

Joan Bakewell, a former pensioners’ tsar under the last Labour Government, who presented the programme, told viewers: ‘We reveal new research which predicts raising alcohol prices could save the lives of thousands of pensioners.’

She also wrote in a newspaper: ‘With 
cheap booze available round-the-clock in supermarkets, there  is 
evidence that if England follows Scotland’s lead, there could be 50,000
fewer alcohol-related deaths over the next decade.’

However,
BBC bosses have admitted the figure was exaggerated, saying the real 
estimate is 11,500. It has ordered that the show be taken down from its 
online iPlayer service and re-edited.

False: Joan Bakewell wrote that cheap alcohol available in supermarkets was responsible for the lives of thousands of pensioners

The
Corporation blamed Sheffield University for providing the wrong 
figures, pointing out that the university had ‘apologised unreservedly’.

In a statement, it said: ‘The School 
of Health and Related Research at Sheffield University emphasised the 
human error was wholly on their part and has apologised unreservedly to 
the BBC.’

In a statement, 
Sheffield University insisted  the mistake did not impact ‘in any way’ 
on other work by its Alcohol Research Group, which has previously 
claimed that a 50p-per-unit minimum price in England would reduce 
alcohol consumption by 6.7 per cent.

BBC bosses have admitted the figure was exaggerated, saying that there could be 11,500 fewer alcohol-related deaths instead of 50,000
