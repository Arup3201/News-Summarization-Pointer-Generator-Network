Manchester United are prepared to commit as much as £100million to their pursuit of Angel Di Maria as the ailing Barclays Premier League club try to beef up Louis van Gaal’s squad before the end of the summer transfer window.

United manager Van Gaal is desperate for world-class additions and has told executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to do all he can to bring winger Di Maria to the club from Real Madrid.

It is understood United have told the Argentine that, with performance-based incentives, they will pay him around £200,000 a week. Over a five-year deal that would take the club's investment to £100m when a transfer fee of around £50m is included.

Principal target: Manchester United are prepared to spend £100m on securing Angel Di Maria's signature

Aware: Di Maria knows that Man United are willing to pay big bucks to bring him to Old Trafford this summer

A salary that size would put the 26-year-old in the same ballpark as Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie.

Di Maria is aware of United’s capacity to pay big wages and has told his family of his surprise that the English club’s offer outstrips anything made by other suitors, including mega-rich Paris Saint-Germain.

It remains to be seen if United can strike a deal with Madrid. Van Gaal and Woodward know they cannot tempt Di Maria or any other targets with Champions League football so financial offers have to be high.

Van Gaal knows he needs signings and wants to buy a central defender and a holding midfielder.

Unimpressed: After United's home defeat to Swansea, Van Gaal is desperate to bring in some new players

While Saturday’s dismal 2-1 home defeat by Swansea came with a clutch of first-team players out injured, it still went a long way to place United’s current predicament in context.

The club have signed only two players — Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera — and done nothing in the market since June. United are also interested in Ajax’s Daley Blind, and were getting close to signing defender Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon on Sunday night.

The Portuguese club want to take Nani on loan in return, although he is reluctant to agree.

Ajax boss Frank de Boer, meanwhile, has offered United some hope by suggesting the Dutch club would be open to an offer for the versatile Blind, a member of Van Gaal’s Holland squad at the World Cup.
