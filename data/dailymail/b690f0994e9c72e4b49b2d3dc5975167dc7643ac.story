Luke Campbell bids to extend his unbeaten professional record to nine fights and move closer to a securing a major summer showdown in his home city on Saturday night.

The Olympic gold medallist faces Argentina’s Daniel Brizuela at Hull Ice Arena while city rival Tommy Coyle takes on former world champion Michael Katsidis.

Campbell and Coyle are being linked with a potential clash at the KC Stadium next year provided both continue to win.

Campbell said: “We both have tough fights on Saturday but if we keep winning then we can be looking at a massive outdoor show at the KC Stadium, which will be great for boxing fans and for the people of Hull.

“Tommy and I have been friends for a long time, we’ve known each other for over a decade, we trained together as kids, but this is the sport we’re in, it’s the entertainment business and we can put our friendship to one side for a night to put on a great show for the fans.”

Coyle scored a stunning last-round knockout over Brizuela in February in a fight in which both men were floored four times.
