Hard-liners in Iran have unveiled two new 'Death to America' songs at the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran, hoping to keep anger high ahead of nuclear talks with Western powers.

They performed the songs on Saturday ahead of a massive planned protest Monday to mark the anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover in 1979.

'Death to America' was one of the main slogans of the Islamic revolution that year.

The anniversary this year is drawing greater attention due to hard-line opposition to moderate President Hassan Rouhani's outreach to the West as talks over the country's contested nuclear program continue.

Hard-liners also criticized Rouhani's historic telephone conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama in September, a gesture aimed at ending three decades of estrangement between the two countries.

Authorities pulled down dozens of anti-U.S. banners and posters around Tehran last week.

But Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said that 'Death to America' will remain their slogan regardless of the relationship between the Islamic republic and Washington.

'Death to America is the manifestation of our nation's determination and resistance against the dominance of oppressive and untrustworthy America,' it said on its sepahnews.com website.

'The revolutionary hatred of Iranians will be manifested nationwide with slogans of ''Death to America''.'

November 4 is the 34th anniversary of the seizure of the US embassy in Tehran, during which Islamist students captured and held 52 US diplomats hostage for 444 days.

The crisis triggered a cut in diplomatic relations and led to decades of mutual hostility.

'American espionage against governments and people in different countries is proof that leaders of the White House can not be trusted,' the Guards said, referring to a row between Europe and Washington over alleged US spying on its allies.

Iran's new president Hassan Rouhani, who has pledged to improve ties with the West, held a historic telephone conversation with US President Barack Obama last month on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.It was the first direct contact between leaders of the two countries in more than three decades.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has backed Rouhani's overtures but criticized some aspects of his UN visit as 'inappropriate'.
