Roberto Martinez criticised referee Lee Mason and accused Bojan Krkic of tricking the official into awarding Stoke a penalty.

Martinez was unhappy that Mason did not show Jonathan Walters a red card for tugging Leighton Baines’s shirt when he was through on goal moments before he awarded a penalty for James McCarthy’s challenge on Bojan who then scored from the spot.

‘The decision on Walters is difficult to understand,’ said Martinez. ‘It’s outside the box but there is no other Stoke defender. He’s the last man and it’s a clear goalscoring opportunity.

‘I don’t understand why it’s a yellow card. It should be a red. It’s very different to play against 10 men than 11, especially against a side who worked well defensively.’

Martinez pointed to an incident in Everton’s draw at Sunderland last month when they were awarded a penalty by Mason but the referee took no action against Connor Wickham who was the last man.

‘My disappointment is we had the same situation last time at Sunderland that was a clear mistake. It was a real bad sign to see the same referee make mistakes applying the same rule. That’s a worry.’

Martinez said he understood why Mason awarded a penalty against Everton but only because Bojan had made the most of little contact from McCarthy.

‘I know the Catalan culture well,’ said Martinez. ‘You’ve been brought up in a way that you’re forcing the referee to make a decision.

‘I don’t think there’s enough contact for it to be a penalty. If he doesn’t give the red card because he’s not sure I don’t understand why he gives a penalty because he can’t be sure it is one.’

Stoke boss Mark Hughes had a different view of both incidents. ‘Jon pulled him back but I don’t think it’s a red because I don’t think you can say it was a clear goalscoring opportunity,’ said Hughes.

‘For the penalty, defenders have to be careful and his leg has been clipped.’
