If you've ever doubted the reach of Disney's most popular character, astronomers have spotted mickey Mouse on another planet.

Photographer Damian Peach was trying to capture storms on the planet when he spotted a familiar face.

The three circular storms were perfectly arranged to form the outline of the much-loved character's face.

Disney's far reach: A full view of Jupiter on February 25, 2014 showing several features including three storms that in combination look like Mickey Mouse.

The fifth planet out from the Sun, Jupiter is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined.

It is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a 'gas giant'.

The fourth brightest object in the solar system, only the Sun, Moon and Venus are brighter.

It is 120 time bigger than Earth.

Experts say the planet is going through  a particularly stormy phase.

'We told you this was going to be a good season to observe Jupiter, and astrophotographers in the northern hemisphere have been making the most of this time of opposition where Jupiter has been riding high in the sky,' said Universe Today.

According to the photographer Damian Peach, Mickey is actually 'two anticyclones (high pressure regions) that form the ears while a longer elongated cyclone (low pressure) forms the face.'

The abundance of storms on Jupiter are a result of the planet’s dense atmosphere of hydrogen and helium and large gravitational field, experts say.

Storms on this planet are likely the strongest in the Solar System.

One, the Great Red Spot, is a huge storm on Jupiter, and has raged for at least 350 years.

It is so large that three Earths could fit inside it.

The upper atmosphere of Jupiter is divided into cloud belts and zones.

They are made primarily of ammonia crystals, sulfur, and mixtures of the two compounds.

Jupiter reached its most northern point for 2014 at a declination of +23.3 degrees on March 11, but it’s still easily visible since it is the brightest starlike object in the evening sky.
