Police Scotland and the Scottish Ambulance Service attended the scene at exit 33 of the ground and the man was transferred to Glasgow Royal Infirmary

Scotland fans go wild as Shaun Maloney celebrates scoring the winning goal at the game at Celtic Park

'There are no suspicious circumstances and a report will be prepared for the procurator fiscal.' 

Shaun Maloney dragged Scotland firmly into the race for Euro 2016 qualification with a superb winner to end the Republic of Ireland's unbeaten start to the campaign.

The Wigan midfielder curled home the game's only goal 15 minutes from time as the Scots finally made the pressure tell against their Group D opponents at Celtic Park.

Substitute Chris Martin had earlier passed up a glorious opportunity to give the home side the lead from close range and Ireland very nearly snatched a point at the death when Robbie Brady's free-kick glanced off a Scottish head and cannoned against the crossbar.
