On-again off-again couple Johnny Weir and husband Victor Voronov have called off their reconciliation one day after saying they were getting back together.

The former Olympic figure skater and his estranged husband announced they were remaining apart just hours after deciding to give things another ago. 

The couple's decision comes just one day after Weir had fired back at Voronov's demands for a public apology with a bizarre and explicit post-nuptial agreement.

It's over...again: Victor Voronov and Johnny Weir (pictured at NY Fashion Week in 2012) have called off their reconciliation today just hours after the estranged couple said they were getting back together

The skater's mother is to blame because of her interfering, according to RadarOnline.

'Victor
 thinks Johnnyâ€™s mother has too much control of him, and has treated him
 like a second class citizen,' a source told the gossip website, adding 
that Mr Voronov feels like there are 'three people' in his marriage.

As part of his conditions for a reconciliation, Weir
 reportedly issued a five-page document including a list of no-no's like
 extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation and bi-yearly STD tests 
from both parties, TMZ reported on Tuesday.

The agreement addresses what was one of the juicier headlines to come out of the couple's bitter battle: cheating. Voronov at one point accused Weir publicly of engaging in threesomes outside the marriage and cheating with a porn star.

The post-nup says those things are off-limits, as are aggressive flirting, oral sex and hookup via social apps like Grindr. While presumably legally binding, the agreement does not cease to be crafted in the most Johnny Weir of ways.

A section about 'ultimatums' in the relationship ends with a loophole for the champion skater.

'If I give you one more day to get your bank records to me,' it reads. 'Then I want to have a free f*** of anyone I want.'

The nasty divorce battle had been publicly escalating since February.

Johnny
 was reportedly set to move back into their home over the weekend, but 
only if the figure skater agreed to publicly apologize to Voronov, TMZ reported.

Voronov's agreement also stipulates that Weir's mother Pamela must stay out of the couple's private life and personal finances.

According to the report,
 Weir was planning to move back into their home as early as Monday but 
the couple were seen bickering over their own reconciliation agreement, which likjely gave the skater the idea for his own legally binding document.

Weir filed for divorce from 
Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating,
 in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi 
Olympics. 

The split 
sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed 
his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages 
to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes.

Pettiness aside: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage

Voronov
 accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' 
email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary 
restraining order by sending the email.

'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, 
hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the 
temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar.

Voronov had the restraining order put 
in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on
 the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him.

'So
 on Monday, Victor filed a police report with cops in Rutherford, New 
Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal 
trouble if the judge finds him in contempt for violating terms of the 
temporary restraining order.'

Voronov,
 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - including an 
affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is 
holding their dog Tema hostage.

Nasty divorce: Weir, pictured naked on his show Be Good Johnny Weir, was accused by Vornonov of sending  nude photos and steamy messages to men online, and his husband also has nude images of him

Nasty divorce: Weir said he was not concerned about his ex sharing naked images of him following the split. He claimed Voronov physically and emotionally abused him

In legal documents obtained by 
TMZ, Voronov alleges Weir forced him out of the closet and that he 
married him because his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would 
make compelling reality TV.

In
 addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also 
requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims 
the Olympian took from him.

These
 include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a 
crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange 
Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags.

The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations.

In
 an interview with Access Hollywood, Weir made his own swipes at his ex,
 claiming his non-practicing attorney husband was often abusive towards 
him and relied on his money.

He claimed he was struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner.

'Sochi
 was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the 
broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in.

'My
 husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off 
camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a
 good place.'

Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding husband

He added that 
their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of 
control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the 
police.

A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm.

Weir
 officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, 
citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about 
his sexuality.

On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov.

But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery.

'A
 marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage 
between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both 
constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's 
constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'
