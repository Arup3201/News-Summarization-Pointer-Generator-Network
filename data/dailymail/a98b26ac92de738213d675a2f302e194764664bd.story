All of the best jobs require bucket loads of experience on a person's CV... and it turns out some of the least desirable vocations do too. 

A new job opening for a global 'brothel tester' has appeared on a German sex website. 

The successful candidate will be both university educated and have spent a large amount of time in red-light districts. 

The German website Kaufmich.com is advertising for a brother tester 

According to The Mirror, the job advert first appeared on Kaufmich.com, which is a website where independent sex workers can sell their trade. 

The Berlin-based business that advertised the job opening is a multinational company which has franchises in China, Germany and Spain. 

They are looking for both men and women, preferably with business degrees, who are able to speak several languages, in particular French. 

Understandably with this job, the candidates should all be in possession of an up to date health certificate. 

Candidates for the job should have plenty of brothel experience (picture posed by model)

The Mirror reports the advert as saying: 'Practical experience with many years of brothel visits necessary. 

'You should enjoy having fun with people and you should not be afraid of contact.'

The role will entail visiting different brothels to check standards of cleanliness, customer service and  value for money. 

They will also be responsible for making sure that the men and women in the business carry out safe sex. 

The red light district in Frankfurt, Germany, where Sex trade laws were radically liberalised in 2002 

Sex trade laws were radically liberalised by the German government in 2002.

Laws were originally relaxed in the hope that they would offer a degree of protection to prostitutes who now have access to health insurance and benefits. 

Red light districts have also become much more prominent in Germany's major cities - there are between 3,000 and 3,500 established brothels in Germany and the trade is now big business.
