Of all household chores, loading and emptying the dishwasher is surely one of the most tedious.But when the items being unloaded are delicious home-made vodka infusions, the job becomes more exciting.

I’m talking about ‘dishwasher vodka’ - a fast-growing internet craze for mixing sweets and chocolate with vodka, and running it through a dishwasher cycle. The heat is just enough to combine the contents without losing any alcohol or flavour.

And while the idea of vodka mixed with pear drops or After Eight mints might sound unspeakably naff, enthusiasts insist the results can be astonishing. I decided to put it to the test . . .

Loading up with flavour: Claudia prepares to wash her cocktail mix

Sweet sensation: Crush sweets and add them to the vodka or, if they'll fit, put them in whole

The good thing about dishwasher vodka is you don’t need fancy, branded spirits as the sweets provide most of the flavour. Cheap brands are fine.

You’ll need a one-litre bottle for each flavour you intend to make. Decant one third and put aside. Add your ingredient of choice to the bottle - approximately 200g for hard, boiled or jelly sweets and 300g for chocolate.

Screw the bottle tightly shut and wrap in cling film to protect from leakage. Shake the bottle and place on a shelf in your empty dishwasher. Do not add any detergent, set to the hottest wash (70 degrees in most models) and prepare to be amazed.

When the cycle has finished, shake again, allow the infusion to cool and then, if necessary, strain away any residue through a tea strainer.

Your vodka can then be chilled or frozen before serving. Here’s how I got on with the ten flavours I tried:

This melted perfectly into the vodka to create a dark orange liquid that did not need sieving. It smelled delicious.The flavour came through and the infusion was sweet and tasty.

Tip: Use a blender on the Pear Drops to break them down in size, it doesn’t matter if they end up being just powder. As they are so sweet and sugary, you can get away with using just 150g.

Too big to fit whole into the bottle and too soft to be blended, the Jelly Babies needed to be hand-chopped. Just as Shirley Conran decided life was too short to stuff a mushroom, I must conclude that it’s also too short to decapitate a Jelly Baby.

Tip: The sweets didn’t melt well, leaving bits behind even after three sieves. I used red ones which gave a lovely soft, pink colour but the taste was weak and acidic. Not worth the hassle. 

Shake it: Mix the ingredients up before putting the bottle in the dishwasher

Soft and gooey, After Eights were easy to squish down into the bottle. They melted fairly well but did need to be sieved a couple of times. The chocolate mints blended to leave an unappealing brown, sludgy colour, but it smelled fresh and tasted sweet, rich and velvety. Beware, it’s very moreish.

Tip: Serve over ice as a longer drink.

These sweets were crushed to a sherbet powder after just a few seconds in the blender and melted brilliantly, leaving an acid yellow cocktail that would be great on a summer’s day. 

I used Pontefract cakes but any form of liquorice will work.

This didn’t melt as well as some of the other ingredients, and needed to be sieved several times. It also blended to a very un-appetising dirty dishwater shade. The flavour was very intense and overpowering - impossible to drink more than one mouthful. 

Zingy: The Skittles vodka has a good kick

Lime treat: The flavour of your Jellies Babies will determine the cocktail shade

The good thing about Skittles is they’re small enough to pour straight into the neck of the bottle.

I used a mix of all the flavours and the infusion melted to a dull, orange colour, a bit like tea. The final mixture ended up with a film of scum on top but this was easily drained away. The taste, however, more than makes up for it — sweet and zingy with a great kick.

Tip: Use one flavour only for a vivid shade. Green and yellow work well.

To create a striking colour I used just green gums and cut them into small pieces. The gums melted reasonably well but needed to be strained to remove some residue.

The colour was amazing and the smell was strong, but the taste was a little underwhelming and syrupy.

Unlike their chunkier Jelly Baby cousins, Gummy Bears fit easily down the neck of a vodka bottle.

They melted well, leaving some jelly at the bottom of the bottle. If using a mixed pack the result is a very attractive tangerine shade. The vodka tasted sweet and mellow and smelled good too.

Tip: Works best as a shot.

Caramel heaven: The Werther's Original flavour is tasty

Cheers: Claudia said the result is worth the effort

These needed to be whizzed and broken down in a blender, but then they dissolved very well with no need to sieve afterwards. The resulting colour is a lovely ‘tequila sunrise’ shade which, when transferred to a glass, looks like a professional cocktail with a tangy and refreshing flavour.

Tip: As with Pear Drops, these are sweet enough to get away with 150 grams.

WERTHER'S ORIGINALS

Make sure you buy the original hard toffee. Break into smaller pieces in a blender or with the end of a rolling pin.

The Werther’s Originals were the best dissolvers overall, and the smell when you unscrew the bottle is exquisite. The vodka is creamy, packed full of caramel flavour without being sickly sweet. 

Dishwasher vodka is quick and fun to make and, in most cases, the result is well worth the small effort. Harder, boiled sweets work the best all round in creating a drink that tastes and looks good. They all freeze well but are best drunk within a week, after which they start to lose colour and flavour. Cheers!
