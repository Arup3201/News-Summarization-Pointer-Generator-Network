Wales boss Warren Gatland has warned his players not to get ‘caught with their pants down’ in Rome after their famous victory over Ireland set up a final-round decider against Italy.

Having edged out their round-four tie at the Millennium Stadium, Gatland’s side are still in the hunt for the championship but they must better the points difference of both England and Ireland to top the standings. 

Wales have won their last seven meetings against the Azzuri, however they will have to prepare for the tie at the Stadio Olimpico with major fitness concerns over Jamie Roberts, Richard Hibbard, Gethin Jenkins and Samson Lee.

‘If you go in with an attitude that we need to score, 20, 30 or 40 points then we’ll get caught with our pants down and be rolled over,’ said Gatland. ‘It will be tough for Italy with a six-day turnaround. Italy are not a bad side. It’s important to do a job up front and accumulate points.

‘It could come down to the last 15 or 20 minutes. It will be nice to go there and get a win and hopefully win by a few. We’re first up at the weekend so we’ll see how the other teams react afterwards. It puts us under some pressure but hopefully it puts England and Ireland under some pressure too.’

England face a potential banana-skin tie against France, while Ireland have a trip to wooden spoon favourites Scotland. 

Like Gatland, Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will also approach the closing weekend with caution. The Kiwi coach found himself in a similar situation 12 months ago, when he pipped the English to the title with a dramatic victory at the Stade de France.

‘I suppose it’s a bit similar to last year, when we just knew we needed the result in Paris,’ said Schmidt. ‘That’s something we managed to do and we won the championship on the back of it, and England had to sit and watch. But you’ve got to beat those teams first. I don’t think you can afford to go anywhere and start chasing points . . . Scotland are going to be very difficult to beat.’

Last night’s defeat in Cardiff was not how Paul O’Connell hoped to celebrate his 100th Test. The 35-year-old was outfoxed at the line-out by Alun-Wyn Jones and Luke Charteris, admitting that he is itching to right those wrongs at Murrayfield next week. 

‘The guys are very disappointed but it’s not up to Joe or me or anyone to lift anyone, it’s up to individuals to lift themselves,’ said O’Connell. 

‘One thing about losing is that you just want to get out there and play again as soon as you can.’

Gatland praised his medical team for introducing a ‘spotter’ who flagged up Hibbard’s head injury.

Following the controversy of George North’s concussion against England, chief medical manager Prav Mathema moved to increase his resources to deal with the issue.

Hibbard’s 78th-minute injury was picked up on video analysis equipment, with the spotter subsequently ordering the team doctors via radio to remove the hooker from the pitch.

‘Prav has put in place a spotter with video access,’ said Gatland. ‘It’s pleasing because there’s been so much said about concussion.’
