These grainy photographs are not for the faint-hearted. . . they may be the most shocking you'll ever see.

From happy to sad, angry to puzzled, this man appears able to change his facial expression in the blink of an eye.

But he does not have a crippling personality disorder, he is in fact the subject of a bizarre Victorian experiment to show the effects of electricity on the face.

The soul of man: Duchenne du Boulogne was convinced the expressions formed by the face were the gateway to the 'soul of man'

Quizzical to confused: French neurology pioneer Duchenne du Boulogne was engrossed by the way muscles in the human face create different expressions

French neurology pioneer Duchenne du Boulogne was engrossed by the way muscles in the human face create different expressions.

Eager to find out which facial muscles portray different emotions, he attached probes to the skin of subjects through which he ran an electrical current.

He believed the expressions formed by the face were the gateway to the 'soul of man'.

Awkward to baffled: He recorded distorted and often grotesque expressions with the recently invented camera

Pained to pensive: The results in the his 1862 tome called The Mechanism of Human Physiognomy

Scared to surprised: It includes detailed investigation into the difference between a genuine smile and a false one

The Duchenne Smile: As a result, genuine smiles are now termed ‘Duchenne smiles’ in his honour

So he recorded distorted and often grotesque expressions with the recently invented camera, publishing the results in the his 1862 tome called The Mechanism of Human Physiognomy.
