Arrest: Ron Martin has been charged for holding a sign on a road

A 33-year-old man who held a sign up on a Texas road warning of a police speed trap has been defending his actions in court.

Ron Martin was arrested in October after an officer spotted him in the median of Eldorado Parkway in Frisco, with a sign that read: 'Police ahead'.

The officers were alerted to Martin's presence when drivers started to wave at them as they drove past the speed trap.

In court on Wednesday, Martin said he held up the sign because he was worried for the safety of the traffic police.

Martin said he had filed several complaints about what he believed were unsafe practices of the traffic officers on the busy stretch of highway.

'They hide behind signs and they use 
their motorcycles sitting in the road, sun going down, without lights or
 anything,' Martin, a sign painter, told Fox News.

'I just feel like it was a little bit unsafe, not only for citizens, but for police officers having to do their job.' 

Texas police said they had spotted Martin holding a sign on the same stretch of road on two other occasions.

On the day of Martin's arrest, Officer Thomas Mrozinski wrote in his report: 'I observed a couple cars drive by traveling westbound waving at us.'

The officer accused Martin of trying to interfere with speed enforcement.

But in court Martin likened himself to the traffic police, saying: 'Ultimately, weâ€™re trying to do the 
exact same thing. I just donâ€™t wear a uniform.'

He added: Iâ€™m the same thing as a speed limit sign, just reminding people that 
there is a limit here.' 

Martin has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor sign for holding a homemade sign.

Texas law doesn't ban people from warning drivers of speed traps, but signs can only be held or displayed on private property.
