Authorities in Northern California on Friday defended the decision to let a suspect go free just hours before he allegedly murdered a beloved Catholic priest inside a church on New Year’s Day.

Humboldt County Sheriff's Lt. Steve Knight said with no serious criminal behavior to hold him, and no evidence of a psychiatric problem, police had no reason to apprehend 43-year-old Gary Lee Bullock after he was spotted loitering outside St Bernard Church in Eureka with a wooden stake in his hands.

A few hours later, Reverend Eric Freed, 56, was discovered beaten to death in the rectory of his church.

‘This was standard practice,’ Knight 
said. ‘It was truly a tragic, tragic event that this happened after the 
fact. Unfortunately, we release people from our jail because we have to,
 and they go commit other crimes. There was no indication of anything 
unusual here.’

Police Chief 
Andrew Mills agreed. He said after the passing security guard noticed 
Bullock in the shadows of church grounds, the guard called police, and 
an officer confronted Bullock on the street in front of the rectory.

The
 officer examined Bullock's jail papers, did a field sobriety test, 
determined he was mentally competent to be in public then directed him 
to a shelter a few blocks away.

‘In
 this, I am satisfied our officers did what they could do, given the 
parameters of the law,’ said Mills. ‘The question becomes could we have 
done other administrative things such as taken him over to the shelter. 
Would that have been reasonable? We'll have to wrestle with these 
questions.’

That frustrates Lisa Russ, who worships at St. Bernard Catholic Church, where Freed was pastor.

‘Our
 police do a good job, but something is broken in our system if we can 
have people arrested and released,’ she said Thursday night outside the 
Gothic church built in 1885 from redwood trees taken from the foggy 
coast.

‘We've got people here we want to be caring and compassionate towards,’ she said. ‘But there's got to be a better way.’

When it comes to holding someone in jail, authorities are constrained.

Officers
 considering a potential ‘5150’ - or involuntary psychiatric hold - must
 determine if the person is a danger to himself or others or unable to 
care for himself.

Because the person isn't under arrest, California law tries to balance public safety with individual rights.

Officers must have probable cause to have a person evaluated by a health professional for a 72-hour hold.

Bullock,
 43, was well-known to authorities in Humboldt County, the heart of the 
Northern California marijuana growing region known as the Emerald 
Triangle.

He was on probation for misdemeanor convictions for cocaine possession and had no record of violent crime.

Bullock
 was arrested for investigation of disorderly conduct at 1.27pm on New 
Year's Eve at his home town of Redway after a mobile home park resident 
noticed him hiding in bushes and ‘acting bizarre,’ said Knight.

Because
 he was on parole, Bullock was taken to jail in Eureka. On the way, 
Bullock tried to kick out the patrol car windows, said Knight.

When
 he calmed down enough for the jail nurse to examine him, his heart was 
racing - too high to be admitted to the jail. So two deputies took him 
to the emergency room at St. Joseph Hospital, where doctors pronounced 
him fit for jail.

Police 
said he was held for eight hours - twice the normal time for a 
disorderly conduct allegation - before being released 42 minutes after 
midnight. He was not given a psychiatric exam.

About
 2am, a security guard passing the church noticed a light on in the 
bathroom of the church fellowship hall, and Bullock standing outside.

The
 guard told Bullock to leave and called police. Later, an officer found 
Bullock in front of the rectory and let him go, authorities said.

About 3.30am, the security guard spotted Bullock outside the church hall again, this time holding a wooden stake, police said.

The
 guard told him to be on his way but did not call police. Mills said 
investigators think Bullock had not gone into the rectory at this point,
 and Freed was still alive. An autopsy has yet to determine time of 
death.

When Freed did not 
show up for morning Mass, someone went looking for him in the rectory. 
He was found dead, apparently beaten. Police said there were signs of 
forced entry and a wooden stake was found.

‘It is a weapon that could have been used in the crime,’ Mills said.

Surveillance video from the rectory also shows Bullock outside, Mills said.

Surrender: Bullock was spotted by officers riding in his stepfather's pickup truck, on his way to turn himself in

When
 a warrant was issued for Bullock's arrest, deputies knew where to find 
him. When deputies drove up the six miles of dirt road to the home of 
Bullock's mother, they said they came across Bullock riding in his 
stepfather's pickup truck, on his way to turn himself in.

He surrendered quietly and was being held on $1million bail. He is expected to be arraigned Monday on a murder charge.

Officials are still seeking a motive behind the clergyman’s killing,

Freed's body was found by staff Wednesday in the St. Bernard Church rectory after he failed to show up for morning Mass, leaving the parish in shock.

Rev. Freed, 56, was the only pastor in St Bernard Church, and had been working in the parish for three years.

Bullock has a criminal history that includes a conviction for cocaine possession last year, Redwood Times reported.

According to a press release from the Eureka Police Department, Bullock was first spotted in the Garberville area of Humboldt County and arrested for public intoxication on New Year’s Eve.

He was taken to jail, but was 'rejected' due to his erratic behavior.

The 43-year-old man was then transferred to a hospital for evaluation, where he became more agitated and had to be physically restrained. He was eventually booked into jail just after 4.30pm Tuesday.

He was released after midnight on New Year's Day. About two hours later, police officers responded to 615 H Street after getting a 911 call about a suspicious person, who turned out to be Bullock.

The 43-year-old, however, was no longer intoxicated, and so he was referred to an emergency shelter for the night.

Father Freed's body was discovered in the rectory at around 9am. Police say the cleric suffered 'significant blunt force trauma' following a violent struggle with his assailant. The murder weapon was recovered at the scene. 

An autopsy will be performed later to determine the victim’s exact cause of death.

Eureka Mayor Frank Jager said Freed was a personal friend and a ‘tremendous person in this community.’ 

Days before his death, Rev. Freed sent his parishioners a message of thanks, wishing them happy holidays.

‘I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to be your pastor,’ Freed wrote on the parish website.

‘Our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as Catholic Christians.’

Loved: Pastor Freed had been working in Eureka for three years, and had previously taught religious studies at a nearby California State University

Motive: Detectives are still trying to determine what prompted the suspect to kill the beloved cleric

Before arriving in Eureka, Rev. Freed taught religious studies at Humboldt University in nearby Arcata for over a decade and spent 'many years' in Japan.

He was also actively involved with the Catholic student 
group Newman Center on campus.

'He was a really, genuinely warm individual," Professor Stephen Cunha, chairman of Humboldt University's religious studies department told CNN.

‘This was not some stuffy clergyman. He was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with.

‘He connected with everybody.’
