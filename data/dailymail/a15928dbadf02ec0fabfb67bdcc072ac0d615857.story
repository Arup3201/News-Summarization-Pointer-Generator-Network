An Adelaide convenience store worker who asked for a photo with Dennis Rodman was stunned when the former basketball star's manager demanded he first buy them two packs of Berocca.

Umar Chaudhary, 35, was working at the It's Convenient! store on Waymouth St in the CBD on Sunday when he recognised the controversial 53-year-old, who is in Australia for his Bad Boy speaking tour.

'He walked in and I could tell that it's him because he's very tall,' Mr Chaudhary told Daily Mail Australia.

'He was with his manager, or somebody like that, and they walked down the aisle and picked up a lot of Berocca.

'I went up to them and I asked "Hey are you Dennis Rodman?" and he said "Yeah I'm the man."'

Mr Chaudhary then asked if he could have a picture taken with Rodman, who is known for his bizarre behaviour including his close friendship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

Rodman's manager interjected and according to Mr Chaudhary said he could take a photo 'Only if you can pay for the Beroccas in his hand.'

Mr Chaudhary said he was 'taken aback' but said OK because he thought it was a joke.

Rodman and his manager kept shopping and came up to the counter with the vitamin tablets and other items including Powerade, protein bars and condoms.

Mr Chaudhary, who works at the store two days per week while he completes his masters in accounting, said the experience was strange but he had no hard feelings

'I scanned the Berocca normally with the rest of his groceries but the manager stopped me and said "Hey, but you said you were going to pay for these from your pocket."

'So I took $40 out from my pocket, showed him the money and printed out receipt to show him and asked "Are you happy?" and he said "Yeah, I'm happy".

'I was actually at the point where the picture didn't mean much to me, it kind of had lost its value.'

The former NBA star posed for a photo and asked Mr Chaudhary if he owned the convenience store or was just an employee.

'I told him I'm an employee,' he said.

'The whole time I thought he was going refund the money and say "I'm just joking" but they walked out.'

Mr Chaudhary, who works at the store two days per week while he completes his masters in accounting, said the experience was strange but he had no hard feelings.

'I told him "At least you'll remember this guy who paid for the Beroccas",' he said.

'I don't care much about it, it's just 40 bucks.

'Sometimes people do weird things, I won't hold it against him.'

Rodman is currently touring around Australia for his 'raw and uncensored' speaking tour.

VIP tickets including a 'meet and greet', photo and a signed jersey cost $249.
