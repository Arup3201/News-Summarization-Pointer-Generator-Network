A U.S. Army veteran is fighting for his life in hospital after allegedly being beaten and so badly burned that he was forced to have his arms amputated by a man he met in a gay bar.

Former soldier Stephen White, 46, reportedly met Garry Gupton, 26, at Chemistry Nightclub in Greensboro, North Carolina, last Saturday night, before traveling to a nearby hotel with him.

But at 4.30am, an employee at Battleground Inn  called 911 after hearing Gupton screaming loudly from the fourth floor. At the same time, the building's fire alarm was activated.

Police and firefighters arrived at the scene to find flames and black smoke pouring out of the pair's room. Inside, they discovered Mr White lying unconscious and critically injured on the floor.

Gupton, a Greensboro city employee, was arrested at the scene, while guests were evacuated. Mr White, who served in the Army during the late 1980s, was rushed to hospital in a serious condition.

In subsequent hours, the victim was forced to have the majority of both of his arms amputated due to severe burns, his longtime partner, Alex Teal, told The Associated Press.

He was also treated for life-threatening smoke inhalation and injuries 'consistent with an assault', he said. He remains in hospital in a critical condition.

Now, Gupton has been charged with aggravated assault with intent to kill in connection with the attack in Westover Terrace. He has not entered a plea and is being held in lieu of $250,000 bond.

Although the motivation behind the alleged attack remains unclear, there is no indication that it was due to the sexuality of the victim, police spokesman, Susan Danielsen, said.

'We believe this was a consensual encounter between the two of them, and at some point Mr Gupton began acting incredibly irrational,' she said.

Guilford County Assistant District Attorney, Howard Newman, said it appeared that Mr White had been struck with a telephone, television and another small piece of furniture during the assault.

He added that he expected arson charges to be filed, as the fire was seemingly intentionally set.

Speaking to the news agency, Mr Teal said he and Mr White had been dating since 2009 and still lived together, but had decided to 'take a break' this summer.

On Saturday, they had reportedly agreed to give their relationship another go, starting the next day. 'So that night was his last night of freedom,' Mr Teal said.

Robert Porter, a bartender at Chemistry, said Gupton had told him he had been experimenting with men since he was 19, and it had taken about a month and a half to work up the courage to enter the bar.

On the night of the incident, Mr White and Gupton, who is reportedly a Crew Member for the city's Water Resources Department, left together in a cab around closing time, bartender Jim Olive said.

'I walked them towards the door and I asked Garry, I said, "So, are you going to hang with my friend Steve tonight?"' Mr Olive said.

'And he said, "Yes." And I said, "Well, I like Steve a lot. Be nice to him."' 

Public Defender, Wayne Baucino, said he had met Gupton for the first time on Friday. 

He declined to comment on the case, except to say that he expected it to go to a grand jury.

Posing: According to Mr Teal, Mr White spent several years with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Air Marshal Service following his Army service. Above, Gupton in another Facebook photo 

'These are hard cases to deal with,' he said. On Saturday, two local bars plan to hold fundraisers to help cover Mr White's treatment.

According to Mr Teal, Mr White spent several years with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Air Marshal Service following his Army service.

He then worked as a security contractor in Iraq in 2005, during which he suffered severe injuries in a blast, Mr Teal said.

'If you tell Stephen he cannot do something, he'll tell you he can,' he said. 'He has this mentality from the military. He goes for it. He goes to the wall... In every sense of the word, he's a fighter.'
