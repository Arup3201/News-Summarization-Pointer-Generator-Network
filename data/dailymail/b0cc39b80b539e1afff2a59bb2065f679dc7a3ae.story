Scotland's vote for independence could have direct implications for Australia, with perhaps the biggest one being a change to the national flag.

Should Scots vote 'Yes' in today's referendum, the British flag could well lose the white cross of St Andrews which forms the base of the British Union Jack. That would mean a complete redesign of the British flag. 

If that happens, it's likely to spark calls for Australia to change its flag too.

Even if Australia was to consider change, it would likely be after both New Zealand and Fiji, which both currently also have the Union Jack in the top left corner.

Both countries have Federal elections this month and key candidates have already flagged their intentions to push for change.

The problem, according to the experts, is that unlike the Kiwis, Australians have not yet been able to settle on one design, despite many years of trying to find an alternative.

This 1993 design by Tony Burton won a Channel 9 competition and was third in Ausflag's flag design competition in the same year

This effort by David Couzens was first pick by viewers of Channel 9

Tony Burton, from Flags Australia, says this is his take on making the Southern Cross more prominent

Flags Australia reported that this 1994 flag design by 'Harold Scruby - is a kangaroo in Aboriginal colours. It was voted the third best in an internet poll associated with Ausflag's 1997-2000 design competition'

'If the Union Jack was to be changed from its current design, you'd take out the very foundation of the whole flag and be left with a collection of crosses on a white field - there would be some awkwardness and embarrassment about that I am sure,' said Tony Burton of Flags Australia.

'Whether other countries with the Union Jack would change their own is the question.

'But one option is to change it with black and green, the colours of the Cornish and Welsh and you would have a hybrid mix that would look simply awful.'

His colleague Ralph Kelly said: 'If the UK could change its flag, which has been going around for 400 years, you'd be right in saying that would neutralise any argument that we cannot because we've had it for 100 years'.

'This would be another reason to re-examine the issue but any change would require the leadership of the Prime Minister, and the last PM to support change was Paul Keating, until he discovered the referendum.'

David White from the College of Arms, the authority which administers flags for the UK and other parts of the Commonwealth, doesn't believe it will cause any problems. 

'I can't see that this would have any effect on the version of the Union Flag which appears in the flag of the Commonwealth of Australia,' Mr White said.

Alan Wright's design (above) has had plenty of support since it was unveiled in 1983

Mr Burton added that Australia's inability to agree on a design which best defines the country is a significant issue.

'I haven't seen anything yet in the many Australian competitions, and frankly the one that stands out still is the Eureka flag - it is a very powerful flag and anyone who has been to Ballarat knows how strong a symbol it is,' he said.

'The Eureka flag means something because of its history but white stars on white bars are a nonsense, there would have to be the work done.

But Tony Buton said none of the alternatives compare to the Eureka flag. He described it as 'powerful'

Mr Burton believes, however, New Zealand and Fiji are likely to move quickly, with prime ministers in both countries raising the issue.

'Frank Bainimarama made a new Fijian flag one of his election promises and John Key said that if he is returned in New Zealand's election soon, that the flag question would be looked at and the Opposition Leader agrees,' added Mr Burton.

For Australia to make any move, it could only happen by way of a national vote or a change to the Flag Act.

Frank Bainimarama has made a new flag a key plank of his election promises leading up to Fiji's general election

New Zealanders are likely to vote on whether they want a new flag soon, as both Prime Minister John Key and Opposition counterpart Phil Goff have both thrown their support behind change.

Pro-republicans have weighed into the argument too, suggesting the push by Scotland serves as a lesson for Australians to have courage in the face of change, irrespective of whether the YES vote wins or not.

Academics agree that this 'once in a lifetime opportunity' will have international ramifications.

'The move to independence by Scotland is a much bigger step than Australia moving to a republic, so a yes vote success with mass celebrations is quite likely to be infectious among nationalistic movements,' Professor Gerry Simpson of Melbourne University said.

'It could well very be contagious when people recognise just how large the consequences are for Scotland.' 

Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull was once chairman of the Australian Republican Movement but his boss, Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) remains a staunch monarchist

However, the Australian Republic Movement (ARM) said the Scotland vote should have no bearing down under.

'There is one parallel however, that an awful scare campaign has been waged there too, as it was here during our referendum,' said ARM national director David Morris.

'We need to be having our own debate now and for the next couple of years, so there's real information out there in the general public.

'There needs to be bi-partisan support, which we don't have at the moment, but only then will we be able to have a true vote, although this winner-take-all system is still not the answer as far as I'm concerned.'

David Morris of the Australian Republican Movement says the only point of comparison between the Scottish vote and Australia's 1999 republican referendum is 'an awful scare campaign' against the yes vote

ARM has confirmed that a new push has started, some 15 years after a referendum on the republic was put to the Australian people - it was lost 55 to 45 per cent.

'The question has to be right, so we are of the view that random deliberative groups should be selected to discuss the real issues,' Mr Morris said.

'If there are concerns about losing our British heritage, let's fix that into the constitution, if there is a worry about not being part of the Commonwealth, let's put it in that we still remain in it.

'We need agreement on a true head of state, someone who truly works for and represents the country.'

Mr Morris also said that 'rather than look to Scotland's result we should look a close look at Ireland, a country we have very close ancestral ties with, as a great example of how presidents of a strong republic can lead and inspire and bring together a nation'.

'Times have changed, and so have we. Our place in the world is secure and we are proud of who we have become.

'We are one of the greatest nations, have one of the best democratic systems and have proved how capable we are.'

The countdown is on! Crowds gather in George Square, Scotland for one of the final pro-independence rallies

University of NSW Business School professor, Richard Holden expects the uncertainty created by a win for the Yes vote will spell big changes in the Aussie dollar's value against the pound.

Despite the serious nature of the Scottish vote, it hasn't stopped some taking to social media to put a humorous spin on the push for independence

Even Tony Burton agrees the identity issue needs dealing with before the flag debate is had.

'I think Australians have got to work out who we really are then if the flag measures up,' he said.

There are other possible repercussions.

A yes vote for Scottish independence could mean a stronger Aussie dollar against the British Pound. That boost to the currency would likely translate into fewer Brits travelling Down Under.

Further, it's feared there'd be an adverse impact on resources exports and that Aussie wine sales would drop.

University of NSW Business School Professor Richard Holden expects the uncertainty created by a win for the YES vote will spell big changes in the Aussie dollar's value against the pound.

He said while it's difficult to predict, the Australian dollar could rise 10 to 20 per cent against the pound from its current level of about 55.7 British pence.

'The pound and the Aussie dollar are one of the world's most commonly traded currency pairs, due to our shared heritage,' he said.

'The biggest Australian exports to the UK are gold, coal, lead and alcoholic beverages, like wine - those would be the ones most likely to be affected.'

A weaker pound would also make trips from Britain to Australia much more expensive and less appealing.

At least 620,000 Brits visit each year (second only to New Zealand) generating almost $3.5 billion for the Australian economy. 

Professor Holden said changes in currency values have impacted tourism flows of other countries in the past.

'When the yen has been stronger that's been associated with more tourism from Japan,' he said.

'With the US and Canada, changes in the exchange rate seem to have an impact on tourism between the two countries.'

Westpac chief currency strategist Robert Rennie said financial markets' jitters could last several years, if Scotland votes for independence.

'Essentially what Scotland will start to do is the negotiation process whereby it becomes and independent nation,' he said.

'We're talking about 300-plus years of history being un-stitched, that's not something that can happen overnight.'

If the 'yes' vote gets over the line, Scotland would become independent in 2016 and it will, at least initially, keep the British pound as its currency.
