Gwyneth's latest blog post on her lifestyle website Goop deals with 'perfection'

From running a website advising fans on how to eat, think, work and dress, to falling out with Vanity Fair over an unapproved article, Gwyneth Paltrow is notorious for striving to be ‘perfect’.

But it seems the 41-year-old may be thinking about relaxing a little.

Becoming rather philosophical recently on her lifestyle blog Goop, the mother-of-two shared some thoughts with her fans about ‘perfection’.

The 
actress says: ‘Striving for achieving a sense of perfection has been a 
misguided belief in my life, often leading me down the wrong path.

‘It
 has made me, at times, place value on the wrong things. It has made me 
not listen to my true self for fear that I would somehow fail in 
another's eyes. I was curious as to how the idea of perfection has 
become so pervasive in our society, how it begins, how it hurts us and 
perhaps, even, if it carries a certain benefit.’

She
 then poses the question; 'Where does this idea that we need to be perfect come 
from?

'How can we come to terms with (and find the beauty in) imperfection?’

Guest posts from Dr. Brené Brown, Ph.D., LMSW, Susan McNary, 
Ph.D., Dr. Jessica Zucker, Ph.D and Peter Sims on the issues surrounding
 perfectionism and how a person can break free of it appear next to the actress's musings.

Gwyneth, who is in the process of separating, or ‘consciously uncoupling’, from husband Chris Martin, has taken great pains to keep the pair's public image very positive.

Whatever is going on behind the scenes, the only side presented to the media is one of happy, mature adults, with seemingly no ill-will toward each other, parting ways while remaining a united parenting team.

Their super-civilised split has reportedly been taken to a new level by hiring  an ‘emotional guru’ to help ease the pain of their split.

Celebrity healer Vicky Vlachonis, 39, who claims she helped Princes William and Harry deal with the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death, is paying weekly 90-minute visits to Paltrow and Martin to administer a range  of wacky treatments – including a ‘Morning Glory’ ritual, salt-and-pepper baths, ‘Tibetan Rites’ and ‘positive self-affirmation’ chanting.

However, this latest post on Goop may raise questions over whether the stunning actress is growing tired of always seeming so together and perfect.

Gwyneth Paltrow suggested that even water has feelings in a post in June and encouraged her Goop readers to consider the impact that unkind words may have on its molecular structure.

On her blog, Gwyneth cited the work of Messages From Water author Masuru Emoto, whose studies have involved talking, shouting and playing music to water to observe the effects.   Gwyneth wrote on Goop: ‘I am fascinated by the growing science behind the energy of consciousness and its effects on matter.

‘I have long had Dr. Emoto's coffee table book on how negativity changes the structure of water, how the molecules behave differently depending on the words or music being expressed around it.’

Japanese scientist Emoto’s hypothesis began with the belief that water adopts the ‘resonance’ of the energy around it, and that polluted water can be restored through prayers and positivity.However his findings have been widely dismissed by the scientific community for a lack of experimental rigour leaving the studies open to the influence of human error.

In 2003, Emoto declined to take part in skeptic James Randi's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which would have won him $1,000,000 had he been able to replicate the experiment under test conditions.
