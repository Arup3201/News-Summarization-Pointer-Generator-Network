A lawyer for an Indian diplomat whose arrest and strip search in New York City drew angry responses from officials in India accused U.S. authorities of bungling the investigation.

On Tuesday attorney Daniel Arshack said the agent who drew up charges against his client made a key error in reading a form submitted on behalf of a domestic worker for Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York.

She was arrested two weeks ago and charged with submitting false documents to obtain a work visa for her New York City housekeeper.

'Mistake': Devyani Khobragade's lawyer claims that officials made an error while reviewing a work visa form she'd submitted for her New York maid

Arshack said in an email that the error 
was in ‘erroneously and disastrously’ mistaking Khobragade's listed base
 salary of $4,500 per month for what she intended to pay her 
housekeeper.

The lawyer said Khobragade's salary 
needed to be listed on the form so that U.S. embassy officials in India 
would know that Khobragade had sufficient income to be able to pay her 
housekeeper $1,560 per month, or $9.75 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.

In court documents, authorities claim she paid her housekeeper about 
$3.31 per hour.

In an 
interview, Arshack said it became apparent as he and others closely 
reviewed the forms Khobragade was required to submit to arrange for the 
hiring of her housekeeper that the information she had submitted had 
been misunderstood.

‘It's incredibly unsexy kind of information, but it does go right to the heart of what this is about,’ he said.

Devyani Khobragade was arrested earlier this 
month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her 
housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour

Prosecutors declined to comment on Arshack's claims.

Arshack
 has represented Khobragade since she was arrested December 13, charged with
 lying on a visa form about how much she paid her housekeeper.

U.S.
 Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed regret over the case while 
Indian officials have said they are outraged, particularly at a 
strip-search of Khobragade that they say was degrading and unnecessary, 
though U.S. authorities have called it standard procedure.

Khobragade
 has said she has full diplomatic immunity, though U.S. officials have 
said her immunity is limited to acts performed in the exercise of 
consular functions.

Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York

She has 
been transferred to India's United Nations mission, an assignment that 
has been processed by the Indian government and the United Nations but 
awaits U.S. State Department approval. She would have broader immunity 
in that position.

In an 
unusual statement last week, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara responded to 
what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case 
by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying 
to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a 
housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was 
contracted to work.

Uttam Khobragade, father of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment

He also 
questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment 
of the Indian housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about 
the alleged treatment of Khobragade.

He
 said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect 
victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal
 status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are.’

These
 developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on 
behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions.

Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in 
July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. 

Mr Richard also said the consular 
official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family 
saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug 
charges.

In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com,
 a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani 
Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions 
or keeping a person in bondage.'

The
 petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family 
several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire 
consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get 
them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.'

Mr
 Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in 
front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of 
what the woman took.

Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go.

Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign soil'.

The case has escalated into an international incident with Indians reacting with fury over the treatment of Khobragade and her claim of being strip searched at a New York jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers.
