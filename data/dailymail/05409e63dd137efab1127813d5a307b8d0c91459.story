Roy Hodgson has hinted that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will not be risked against Uruguay in England's potentially decisive World Cup Group D clash on Thursday.

The Arsenal forward had impressed during England's final warm-up games before a knee injury suffered against Ecuador almost ended his World Cup hopes.

Although Oxlade-Chamberlain was eventually included in the 23-man squad and has been recovering well, Hodgson has confirmed he is unlikely to use him against Uruguay.

'He is not in contention for tomorrow, but he will take part in the next four training sessions,' Hodgson said of his only injury concern.

'Today was his last training session as, if you like, an individual.

'At the minute, we could have taken a chance with him tomorrow, but it would be much better if he uses the four days after this game and before the Costa Rica game to train with the team.

'Fortunately for us, his actual injury has responded really well to treatment but I don't think we will put him into the firing line tomorrow before he has had some training sessions with the team.'

The Three Lions manager would not be 
drawn on the debate surrounding Wayne Rooney, but did use statistics as 
evidence the Manchester United is still performing for the team despite 
failing to score his first World Cup goal.

Speaking about Rooney, he said: 'I try not to comment too much on where pressure is
brought to bear. I don’t control what people are writing or reporting.

'I was
satisfied with his performance against Italy. Stats said ran more than any England
player, had more sprints than any other.

'Wayne is one of our three players with World Cup and Europen Championship experience with 100 caps, or nearly in Wayne’s case, and they have to
expect the focus is on them.

'The good thing is that Wayne more than happy to do
that. If he plays, I hope you’ll see that in his performance.'

High spirits: England players share a joke ahead of what could be the defining game of their World Cup

England face being eliminated from the World Cup should they lose to Uruguay and Italy draw with Costa Rica.

However, Hodgson is confident they can still progress despite losing their opening game in Manaus. 'I am confident. It’s three important games, each stands alone.

'We’ve had the first and we’ve analysed the good and the bad from it. We’ve definitely got it out of our system and we’re focused on tomorrow. It will be a good game against a very good team. We always knew more than two contenders in this group,' he said.

Of Thursday's opponents, Hodgson conceded the strength of their team and emphasised how important a part England's defence will have to play to deny their talented forwards.

'They have two absolutely top class forwards in Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani and a third in Diego Forlan,' said the England manager.

'They have very talented midfielders also, especially Rodriguez and they’re strong at set-plays and very experienced. Add them together and it’s a strong team.

'They must be disappointed with opening game but like us that’s in the past. We expect to see Uruguay with their big guns blazing. We’ll have to be certain our defending is sufficient to keep them at bay while posing questions ourselves.'
