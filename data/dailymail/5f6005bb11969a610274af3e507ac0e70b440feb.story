An actor who rubbed shoulders with Hollywood A-listers at Cannes last month is back to his day job - working as a £16,000-per-year binman.

Gary Maitland, 28, stars in Ken Loach's new film The Angel's Share which scooped the Jury Prize at the festival.

But the film star has yet to land a full-time acting role so is back to loading rubbish onto the back of a lorry in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, Scotland.

A movie star? Rubbish! Binman Gary Maitland, 28, who has appeared in three hit movies over the last decade while working collecting the rubbish in South Lanarkshire

The actor has appeared in two of Ken Loach's earlier movies - Sweet Sixteen in 2002 and Tickets in 2005.

Gary, who has been working as a binman for the last 10 years, said he had no intention of giving up his job despite flying off to promote the film with Mr Loach next month.

He works from 7.30am to 3.30pm cleaning the streets of South Lanarkshire.

Speaking from the South Lanarkshire Council bin depot in Rutherglen, Scotland, Gary said: 'We are all mates here, I come in at 7.30am and I have my bit to do like anyone else - being in a movie doesn’t change that.

'But I am on the look-out for an agent. I have a couple of calls in and I’m waiting for a response and obviously if the right part came up I would do it, it’s a no-brainer.

'But for the time being I’m happy doing what I’m doing. I’ve been here 10 years, it’s part of my life.'

Gary first hit the big screen in 2002 when he appeared in the Ken Loach movie Sweet Sixteen.

Acting chance: Ken Loach got in touch with Gary Maitland and offered him a role in his new film seven years after his last movie role

He got a second chance to appear on film in another one of the director's films called Tickets in 2005.

He got another chance to star in a 
film when he received a message from Ken Loach's casting director 
Kahleen Crawford on Facebook.

Gary
added: 'One night I was on Facebook and I got this message out the blue
asking if I was the same Gary Maitland that has appeared in Sweet 
Sixteen and Tickets.

'I replied "in the flesh", and gave her my new mobile number which had been changed since I last worked with Ken.

'I was really surprised because it had been a few years since Tickets and I just wasn’t expecting it.

'It kind of spiralled from there. She told me Ken was in Glasgow so I went to meet him in the city centre. I did a couple of auditions and I got the part, I had no idea it would be such a big role, I assumed it was just a wee one.

'I keep seeing my face on the poster on the side of buses while I’m out working. It’s a lot of fun.'

The Angel’s Share follows Robbie, played by Glasgow-born actor Paul Brannigan, a desperate father who tries to turn his life round with a whisky heist.

The film, which won the prestigious Jury Prize at Cannes, was shot on location in Glasgow.

Gary, who plays goofy character ‘Albert’, said he is still in contact with Mr Loach and the movie’s cast, teacher Siobhan Reilly, actress Jasmin Riggins, established star John Henshaw and Glasgow-born newcomer Paul Brannigan.

The film had its Scottish premier at Cineworld, in Renfrew Street, Glasgow, last month and has had good reviews around Britain.

Gary said he hopes to be featured in any upcoming Ken Loach movies.

The part-time actor, who is single, added: 'I get a bit of banter from the lads but nothing as changed.

'People come up to me in the pub sometimes but my life hasn’t changed very much.

'I am open for anything really. My bosses have been really great letting me take unpaid leave for seven weeks during filming and letting me take holiday for the promotional tour next month.

'It would be great to work with Ken again. He obviously likes something about me and I know the way he works.

'But I would like to work with someone else as well for the experience. I’m not going to say how much I got paid for The Angel’s Share but it was enough.

'I’ve always been into drama and did it for my Highers so to be a full-time actor would be a dream for me.'

Gary’s fellow binman Kevin Kennedy, 31, a father-of-three, from Hamilton, said: 'I went to see it with the missus. It was strange seeing Gary on the big screen as I work with him.

'It was a brilliant film. Gary’s the same guy he’s always been, he does his bit at work and we still go out for drinks.'
