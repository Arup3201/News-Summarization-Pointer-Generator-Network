Jose Canseco has broken down in a TV interview over the gun accident that saw him accidentally blow off his own finger and almost shoot his fiancee

The overcome former Major League Baseball star was told he will never regain full use of his left hand after the weapon discharged while he was cleaning it at his Las Vegas home on Tuesday

But it's a price he's willing to pay for the safety on his future wife, swimsuit model Leila Knight.

Now recuperating after doctors reattached the digit in an emergency surgery, the 51-year-old burst into tears as he explained what happened to Inside Edition on Thursday.

'At first I heard it go off and I actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table,' Canseco said in the interview.

Overcome: Canseco bursts into tears as he traces back what happened inside his Las Vegas home

'(I) thought nothing had happened. Then I look at my hand and my finger’s blown off.'

Canseco explained the bullet only narrowly missed Knight, who was standing nearby.

She quickly ran to his aid.

'I was telling Jose not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out,' Knight told Inside Edition.

Knight wrapped his hand in a towel and called 911.

'I’m just glad nothing happened to her (Knight),' Canseco said.

'If it’s a lesson having to lose a finger, so be it.'

Recovering: Jose Canseco tweeted this photo from his bed at home on Wednesday after accidentally shooting off the middle finger of his left hand while cleaning one of his guns on Tuesday afternoon

The incident occurred in the kitchen of the Vegas house at about 3pm Tuesday.

In an interview with The New York Daily News, Knight said her husband had been at a shooting range a few days earlier.

He then decided to clean the weapon but didn't realize it was still loaded.

'The middle finger was hanging by a thread, and I wrapped his hand in a towel and then called 911,' Knight told the newspaper.

'The doctors said they would either have to amputate or do reconstructive surgery.

'But if they do surgery, he won’t be able to use it again.

'He blew away an artery and a big bone chunk.'

Knight reiterated the situation could have been much worse, and that she could have been shot.

Canseco was in surgery until late Tuesday night. 

Records show that Canseco owns the home where the incident occurred.

The Cuban-American dominated the MLB with his hitting prowess in the 1980s, but later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career. 

Canseco is a right-handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star. 

He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox during a career that spanned from 1985 to 2001.
