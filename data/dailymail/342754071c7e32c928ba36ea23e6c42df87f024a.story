Seven students have been charged with sex crimes after an investigation into a hazing on a high school football team found they trapped and assaulted new young players against their will.

A parent of a player in the football program at Sayreville War Memorial High School, New Jersey, claims that seniors on the team would turn off the lights in the locker room, pin a freshman, stick their finger into the freshman's rectum and, at times, then put that finger in the young man's mouth.

The attacks between September 19 and September 29 happened on a near daily basis, according to the report. 

Tonight, Middlesex County prosecutor Andrew C Carey issued a warrant for the arrest of seven pupils aged 15 to 17 at the school, a regional football power.

Sayreville War Memorial High School has been rocked by allegations of bullying, intimidation and harassment among players on their popular football team. Here students are seen arriving at the school this week

Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying' on the football team

A reported hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the high school football team that has resulted in the cancellation of the school's football season. Patel believes when investigation is done, the cancellation of the school's football season will be seen as an overreaction

Six of the seven were arrested last night and the other is still being sought. 

Three were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children.

The four other students were charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes. 

Those in custody were awaiting a Family Court decision on whether they would be held at a juvenile detention facility or be released to their families. 

Their names weren't released because of their ages.

On Monday night, schools Superintendent Richard Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season after the prosecutor's office substantiated allegations of hazing involving members of the school's football team.

Parents in the township have complained that the whole team is being punished. 

However, the victims' families insist the gravity of the case warrants the drastic measures.

'In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen,' reports NJ Advance Media. 

'Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player’s mouth.'

One official also told ABC News, '[The freshmen] would live in fear of seniors and juniors.

They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.'

This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. 

Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'.

He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'.

'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. 

According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department.

'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added.

No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. 

He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated. 'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said.

Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports.

Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players.

'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said.

'For all of them, the ones who are innocent, to have this taken away from them. They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added.

A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree 

I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.'

But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying.

One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.'

'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.'

Sayreville High School's football team - which one of New Jersey's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations,

Meanwhile, police are investigating former assistant coach of the Sayreville High School football team Charlie Garcia on drug charges.

Garcia, 38, resigned from his position at the school after he was found with more than two boxes of steroids and more than a dozen syringes during a traffic stop late last month.

According to NJ.com, he was charged with third-degree illegal possession of steroids, possession of hypodermic needles, driving with an expired license, failure to signal a lane change and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle.
