Wannabe gang boss: Damien Noonan, 25, was warned that 'celebrity status' wouldn't keep him out of prison

A “celebrity” crime family who have become reality TV stars have been warned they will never be untouchable - after one of them began almost seven years in jail.

Damien Noonan, 25, was arrested after he plotted to flood the streets with a banned dance drug and arranged the brutal abduction and torture of a man.

He had believed he could get away with his crimes after his crimelord uncle Domenyk, 46, agreed to star in a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary made by broadcaster Donal MacIntyre about his life as the head of one of the UK’s most notorious crime families.

Damien Noonan Jnr. was jailed at Preston Crown Court for six years and nine months for kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to supply drugs - as TV’s Crime and Investigation continued to screen their At Home With The Noonans.

Two other men from his crime mob, Dwayne Devaney and Forbes Edwards, both 23 were also sentenced to six years and nine months each.

Today Detective Chief Inspector Rick Jackson from Greater Manchester Police’s Serious Organised Crime Group said: 'This case clearly illustrates that irrespective of who you are or think you are, we are determined to catch up with you and make you face the consequences of your actions.

'These offenders were witnessed attacking and kidnapping a lone individual in what was a cowardly attack. The sentences received reflect the significant menace they posed to the community.

'They ruined lives by striking fear and intimidation within their local community to feed their egos and it is for that reason that these are exactly the types of individuals we will continue to tirelessly target.

'We will bring all the necessary resources to bear on those that ruin the quality of life for others.'

Mr Noonan and and two other masked thugs had abducted 29-year old Steve Barton in the street in Chorley, Lancs, in October last year as children played nearby, then bundled him into a Nissan Qashqai car and bound him with tape.

Witnesses said the masked men punched, kicked and stamped on their target and given a 'severe beating' until he passed out before dragging him into the car.

During the victim’s hour long ordeal, the gangsters threatened to shoot him in the knees and burn his fingers off with a blowtorch. But when armed police stopped the kidnappers’ vehicle in a pub car park in Whitefield, Manchester and drew their guns, Noonan fainted.

A cosh and meat cleaver were found in the thugs’ car. Preston Crown Court was told Noonan carried out the kidnap for a friend who was a love rival of Barton.

Barton received treatment for his injuries in hospital which were consistent with a severe beating.

Jacob Dyer, prosecuting, said: ,During the man’s incarceration one voice said they would blow his kneecaps off another said: "don’t forget the blowtorch we’ll burn his fingers off"

'Armed police acting on a tip off stopped them soon after. The officers were forced to smash the car windows and throw CS gas canisters inside to detain the men and rescue their victim who had been almost stripped naked during the struggle.'

The kidnap occurred whilst Noonan was on bail after he was caught arranging for 890 grams of methcathinone, smuggled into the country from China, to be sold to a gang.

Officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency had the conspirators under surveillance and seized the consignment, worth around £18,000 on the street, after a handover. Noonan had previous convictions for violence including affray and common assault.

After the case Detective Superintendent Neil Hunter from Lancashire Police’s Force Major Investigation Team said: 'The motive for this heinous offence is still unclear as the defendants elected to maintain their right to silence when questioned.

'But it is important to stress that kidnaps of this nature are extremely rare in fact even rarer than homicide.

'The shocking nature of this offence was that it was committed in broad daylight in full view of young children playing out and on a very nice housing estate in Chorley.

'This was a particularly vicious assault carried out by a ruthless organised crime group.

'The hostage, Steven Barton, was chased over parked vehicles and through gardens until he was eventually caught.

'He was viciously assaulted and dragged screaming into the car where he was stripped naked, bound and gagged and forced into the boot of the vehicle before being driven away from the area.

'This was an excellent of cross 
border cooperation between Lancashire Constabulary and Greater 
Manchester Police and I cannot praise them highly enough as when the 
stolen car was stopped by police the hostage was found naked in the 
vehicle, still restrained by the ankles and legs, gagged with a broken 
jaw and other injuries.

'Mr
Barton was extremely fortunate as I’ve no doubt that without the police
intervention his injuries would have been far more serious, if not 
fatal.'

Desmond "Dessie" Noonan was the 'political fixer' for the Noonan family and was stabbed to death in 2005

Domenyk Noonan has more than 40 convictions for a wide range of offences including armed robbery, police assault, possession of firearms, prison escape and fraud and has spent 22 years in prisons across Britain.

He and his late brother Desmond were the subject of a 2006 documentary A Very British Gangster directed by MacIntyre. The latest documentary series features interviews with Noonan from behind bars.

He had been freed last year halfway through a nine and a half year prison sentence after a gun was found under the bonnet of his Jaguar car - but he was recalled to prison on a number of occasions for breaching the terms of his early release.

His parole board hearing, which had been due to take place earlier this month, has been delayed indefinitely. It is understood Noonan, who changed his name to Lattlay-Fottfoy, was filmed for the series while he was out of jail and he also spoke to the documentary makers on the phone when inside.
