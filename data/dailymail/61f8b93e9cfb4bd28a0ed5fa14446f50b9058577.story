But a new report by In Touch claims that Khloe Kardashian's real father is none other than Lionel Richie.

A source told the publication that the reality star's mother Kris Jenner had an affair in the 'wild 1980s' with the Dancing On The Ceiling sensation and Khloe is the love child of their 'sexual affair'.

Parentage speculations: New report claims that Khloe Kardashian's real father is none other than Lionel Richie

The insider claimed that Kris, now 58, enjoyed a fling with Lionel, 65, while still married to Robert Kardashian.

'They had a sexual affair - he bragged about it,' the source, who claims to be friends with Lionel, stated, 'He said he was on the outs with his wife at the time.'

Adding: 'Everyone was sleeping around with everyone else back then, and Kris was hot in those days.'

The insider also gushed that Lionel's biological daughter (Nicole is adopted) 16-year-old Sofia 'looks like she could be Khloe's little sister.'

While Jacky Jasper, founder of blog Diary Of A Hollywood Street King, told In Touch: 'Kris had an affair with Lionel - and I believe he is Khloe's dad.'

And as far as the 'wild 1980s' goes, one of the momager's friends hairstylist Daniel DiCriscio told the publication: 'She was a big flirt and played around. I've seen Kris do things that would blow people away.'

DiCriscio was also quick to note that Lionel was 'a huge player' at the time.

Khloe told Gossip Cop after the report was published: 'I’ve had so many dads my head is spinning lol.' 

MailOnline has contacted the reps for Kris Jenner, Lionel Richie, and Khloe Kardashian for comment. 

Khloe, 30, was born in 1984, which was apparently the height of the 'swinging' 1980s in Hollywood.

Kris has previously admitted to having an affair during her marriage to first husband Robert Kardashian in her tell-all book Kris Jenner and All Things Kardashian.

'Robert had been the only man in my life since I was 18,' she revealed in her book.

Adding about the affair: 'I don’t know why I was having a mid-life crisis at 30, but I was. His name was Ryan, and he was a producer. We had wild sex everywhere, all the time.'

Robert is said to have filed for divorce after catching Kris out at a restaurant with her lover.

In 2012 O.J. Simpson's manager spoke out to claim the jailed American Football star could be Khloe's father. 

However Pardo's allegations owe more to a hunch than any inside knowledge.

'Whenever I bring it up, he giggles,' he told In Touch at the time.

While Kris and her then-husband Robert Kardashian were close to the Simpsons, this is the first time OJ had been named as a potential father to Khloe.

Robert, however, and his family were close to Simpson after he served as a member of OJ's 'Dream Team' as his attorney in the famous 1995 murder trial.

While Kris Jenner has openly admitted cheating on her former husband, she has always strongly denied any suggestion that Robert was not her daughter's father.

'I have never heard such crap in my life,' she told GMA in 2012.

'I was there, right. I gave birth, I know who the dad was. Everything’s good. We’re all good. It’s the family joke because Khloe was blonde and not dark-haired.'

And while Khloe has slammed previous allegations regarding her parentage, she has herself questioned if she was adopted on the family's reality TV show. Viewers of Keeping Up With The Kardashians did see her question who her parents were in an episode in 2009.

The reality star wanted to prove she was not adopted and tested the maternity of her mother Kris Jenner.
