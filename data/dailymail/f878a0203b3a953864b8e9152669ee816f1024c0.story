It's a dinner party scenario we are all familiar with.

But red wine spills on the carpet could be a thing of the past, thanks to a new glass design.  

The clever Saturn spins around on its base, never fully tipping over as it resets itself to a new angle. 

The new Saturn wine glass is said to be 'spill-proof', no matter which way you tip it the wine won't come out

The company behind the creation, US-based Super-Duper-Studio, said: 'These spacey glasses are our re-imagination of a traditional Italian glassblowing technique, which we appropriated to prevent messy spills and stains.

'Four years of research and refinement has culminated in Saturn Glasses that are surprisingly light and satisfying to drink from.'

Christopher Yamane, a graphic and industrial designer, teamed up with designer Matthew Johnson to create the glass, for which a price has not been revealed.

Explaining the method used to make the Saturn glass, the studio said: 'To prepare the material for each cup, the molten glass is shaped by hand before being blown into a mold by glass artisans in Oakland, California. 

'Each glass is then annealed overnight (a process which cools the glass slowly to relieve material stresses), cut, and polished by hand.'

It's nice to enjoy a glass of wine with friends... but not so nice when someone has an accident!

Christopher Yamene who designed the wine glass said that it is especially perfect for red wine as it does not matter if the temperature of your hand affects the drink 

The glasses are said to hold a small to medium-sized glass of wine - about 125ml-175ml. 

They stack into each other and will stand upright on a flat surface. 

The only issue with the glasses, Yamene explained to design website Dezeen, is that without a stem, the heat of the hand can affect the temperature of the wine. 

He said: 'One small downside for not having a traditional stem seems to be how the temperature of your hand affects the temperature of the wine, but isn't as big of a problem in the red as the white.'

Red wine is typically drunk at room temperature although it can be served slightly warmer, while white wine is generally served chilled.

If you haven't managed to get your hands on a set of Super-Duper-Studio's Saturn wine glasses then you might want to check out these handy tips for removing a red wine stain... 

1. The Salt Trick

This only works if you act fast but tipping a small amount of salt onto the spill can help to draw the wine out. 

2. Dab, don't rub! 

Dab the red wine with a cloth but make sure you do not rub it. Rubbing will only increase the size of the stain and make it worse. 

3. Shake your soda

Pouring soda water onto a red wine stain can remove it. Slowly pour the water onto the stain, letting it bubble. When it has removed the stain dab any excess liquid with a cloth. 

4. Boil it up

Particularly good for clothing stains, boil a hot kettle and stretch the material out over the sink. Pour the boiling water down through the item of clothing which will wash out the stain.

5. Crush that cat litter

It might not sound like the most savory method but crushing cat litter onto the stain can help to absorb the wine much in the same way that salt would.  

Oh dear, spilling red wine can be an absolute nightmare if you don't know how to get it out
