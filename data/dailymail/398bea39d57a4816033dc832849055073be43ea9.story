Great white sharks are one of the few species known to regularly poke their heads above the surface to survey the scene.

And this huge female is no exception as she rises from the ocean just yards from a cage full of stunned divers.

The image was captured by British photographer Dale Morris, 40, during a cage diving trip in Mossel Bay, South Africa.

The shark breached the surface several times as it 'sniffed the air' in a bid to discover its next dinner

He said: 'Some were five metres long and a five metre great white shark is usually a very fat creature.

'They appeared to be bigger than the small boat we were in. Some would breach and stare right into our faces as they came up.

'When these really big sharks turned up, the smaller ones would vanish. One shark in particular was very crafty. She drifted past the boat several times before swimming away from us.

'It was if she made a show of letting us know she was going. Then, within seconds of us losing sight of her moving away from the boat, she would suddenly burst out of the water right next to us from a completely different direction.'

Great white sharks, which often hunt seals, are known to poke their heads above the surface to spot prey.

Another theory is that they are smelling for whale carcasses above the water, as scent travels faster through air than through water.

And in order to attract them to the boats, the tours will chum the sea by dropping mixtures of blood and rotten fish into the water.

Dale Morris, who took the photographs, said he once witnessed a great white shark get its teeth stuck in the bars of a diving cage, although he said he is unaware of sharks eating any tourists using similar protection

But despite their huge size and power, cage diving with great whites is considered a safe activity.

Mr Morris, who hails from London but now lives in South Africa, added: 'There have been no incidences of sharks eating tourists who go on a shark cage dives, although I did once witness a shark get its teeth stuck on the cage.

'Its thrashing nearly pulled the cage away from the boat. I was inside at the time and had a very good view of what it must feel like to be a seal in its last moments of life.'

Researchers use dead fish, known as chump, left, and a board shaped like a giant fish, right to attract sharks
