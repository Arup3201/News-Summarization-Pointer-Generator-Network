Lewis Baker is the 30th Chelsea player to have left the club on loan this season alone. He is perhaps the club’s brightest prospect in years and could now spend the rest of this campaign at Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship.

There have been some dissenting voices at the Blues’ use of the system, with the staggering statistics used as a stick to beat the big spenders with. 

Thirty this season, and similar numbers in each of the last three, too.

Jose Mourinho knows there are two types of loan deals. The first is to allow the real talents to hone their skills in lower divisions in a bid to hit the ground running on arrival back at Cobham. 

The second is to merely push players into the shop window; those who will not make it into the club’s first-team squad, but who could happily carve careers for themselves in League One, the Championship or lower reaches of the Premier League.

Mourinho cannot escape the fact that the only player of genuine title-winning pedigree to break through from the academy over the last 15 years is John Terry.

But now he believes they have a cluster ready to make the big time. The manager said at the start of the season that he would have failed should Baker, Isaiah Brown and Dominic Solanke don’t find themselves England players in the future.

He also spoke about the academy structure at Chelsea last month.

'If you don't bring kids through the academy, the best thing is to close the academy,’ he said.

‘If the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough, and you don't bring kids up, then close the door and use the money to buy players.

‘You need to prove the academy works well and is worth it.

‘For the first time I have been at Chelsea there is a clear group of four or five players between 17 and 20 clearly identified that we know — unless something happens inside their heads — that have to be Chelsea players.

‘If, in a few years, Baker, Brown and Solanke are not national team players, I should blame myself.’

Baker is the first of the clutch – that includes Ruben Loftus-Cheek - to depart temporarily, and will learn his craft in the second tier.

Chelsea see this as key in their players’ development and offers an indication as to whether they will sink or swim when asked to make the step up.

Past experiences dictates that more than a few could fail, however.  

Big things were expected of Josh McEachran, for example, but his floundering in the Championship meant he is extremely unlikely ever to play at Stamford Bridge again.

The game time their crop of young talent is currently garnering should stand them in good stead to make a run at the first team; and if not, to impact on other Premier League clubs further down the line.

Patrick Bamford perhaps won’t provide much competition for Diego Costa or Loic Remy as a central striker, but – given his prowess for Derby last year and Middlesbrough this – should find he enjoys a career in the top flight.

But then there are the likes of Tomas Kalas who is at German side Cologne, even though the central defender so impressed at the back end of last season.

Looking back to last year, the central midfielder George Saville formed part of Brentford's midfield who passed their way out of League One and earned a permanent move to Wolves on the back of it. While he never played for the Chelsea senior team, they should consider that a job well done.

There are too many who fall by the wayside, though.

McEachran is clearly one. Wigan nor Watford didn't fancy him last year and - despite being given chances at Swansea City and Middlesbrough - he has now been farmed out to the club's partner team Vitesse.

Gael Kakuta has jumped from club to club, too. The man whose transfer in 2009 cost Chelsea more than a few headaches needs to kick on but they have afforded him ample opportunity. Now at Rayo Vallecano, his time is now.

Mourinho just hopes that the alarming lack of academy products playing for Chelsea will change.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek

The imposing box-to-box midfielder made his first-team debut against Sporting Lisbon last month. Seen as the one of the club’s top prospects, the 17-year-old stands at 6ft 4in and is able to dominate a game with his physical presence and range of passing.

Lewis Baker

Dubbed the academy’s successor to Frank Lampard, Baker appeared for Chelsea in last season’s FA Cup and is the current England Under 20 captain. A bustling midfielder with a lethal eye for goal, the 19-year-old will be eager to try his hand in the Championship with Sheffield Wednesday.

Jeremie Boga

Frequently the shining light in games well above his age group, the diminutive attacking midfielder is the focal point of the Chelsea Under 21s attacking play. Able to fearlessly run at defenders and possessing a great finish, at just 18 Boga is one of the jewels in the academy crown.

John Swift

Having lost his way at Rotherham in the first half of the season, Swift has a chance to be a vital part of high-flying Swindon’s promotion push from League One. With an accomplished creative eye and a composure on the ball that belies his 19 years, Swift provided the craft to Baker’s hustle for last season’s youth side.

Izzy Brown

Snapped up from West Brom in 2013, striker Brown has been tipped for England stardom by Jose Mourinho. Helping England win last summer’s Under 17 European Championship, Brown’s hold-up play, technique, speed and finishing ability means he is adept across the front line.
