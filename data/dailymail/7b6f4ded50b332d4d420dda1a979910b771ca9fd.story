Nathanial McIntosh persuaded a court to have his curfew lifted so he can go on holiday to Thailand

A violent thug has successfully applied to have a curfew lifted by magistrates so he can go on holiday to Thailand. 

Nathanial McIntosh, of Falmouth, in Cornwall, is serving a 12-week suspended sentence after abusing three people. 

The non-league footballer, who plays for Wendron United, was convicted on January 22 and was also given an eight-week curfew to stay at home between the hours of 7pm and 6am. 

But the 23-year-old went back to court to plead with officials to have the curfew lifted because he had booked a month-long holiday in Thailand. 

Magistrates in Truro, Cornwall, have agreed the curfew can be relaxed until McIntosh gets back from his trip.

The decision to relax Nathanial McIntosh's curfew has been branded 'ludicrous' by one victim of an unrelated crime.

But Peter Chapman, chairman of the Magistrates' Association's sentencing committee, explained: 'If the curfew clashes with work, a pre-booked holiday, a relative's wedding or a job interview, magistrates can adjust the curfew as they see fit.'

A Ministry of Justice spokesman added: 'Only courts can vary the requirements imposed under suspended sentence - this is solely a matter for them.'

McIntosh pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent against three people and was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for a year.

Last month he was also fined and banned from the road for drink-driving after he was found three times over the limit.
