A destructive flatworm is threatening to wipe out Britain’s entire population of snails, experts say.

The New Guinea flatworm, a vicious predator that overwhelms snails in a ‘gang attack’, was spotted in Europe for the first time this month.

Experts fear that it could soon travel into Britain, hidden in one of the thousands of potted plants imported every month.

Killer: The worm is relatively large, about 40 to 65 mm in length and about 4 to 7 mm wide. Its body is however quite flat, being less than 2 mm in thickness. In the Pacific Islands, several native land snails have gone extinct because of their voracious appetite

Matt Shardlow, head of the Buglife Invertebrate Conservation Trust, said the animal and its eggs cross borders in soil, foliage and branches.

The flatworm, also known as Platydemus manokwari, eats a variety of invertebrates including land snails.

It is relatively large, about 40 to 65 mm in length and about 4 to 7 mm wide. Its body is however quite flat, being less than 2 mm in thickness. 

The worm has had several effects on the environments it is introduced to.

In the Pacific Islands, several native land snails have either gone extinct or their numbers have drastically reduced.

Currently, there are no known methods for controlling the New Guinea flatworm.

This makes the eradication of the species especially difficult.

He said imports of exotic plants had accelerated the spread of other harmful non-native species, including Asian hornets, oak processionary moths, and lily beetles.

Mr Shardlow said: ‘A flatworm that overwhelms snails in a 'gang attack' and has caused many extinctions when introduced to other parts of the world has now arrived in Europe.

‘Urgent action is necessary to save wild British snails - the UK Government should close the borders to pot plants.’

He added: ‘It only takes one or two eggs in a pocket of air deep in the soil to survive and a potentially devastating invasive species has crossed over a border and threatens a new country, where there is no strategy to deal with the invader.

‘There is no need to import pot plants into the UK - horticulturalists here are quite capable of growing our own pot plants and selling them on the domestic market.’

Mr Shardlow said that his charity is a supporter for bugs of ‘all shapes, sizes and habits’.

Endangered? Experts are concerned that Britain's garden snails could be wiped out if the flatworm is accidentally transported on an imported pot plant

But he added: ‘There are some bugs that we are less keen on – bugs in places where they should not be that are causing damage to wildlife.’

The Government is keeping a wary eye out for the species.

A spokesman said: ‘We do not believe that there are any New Guinea flatworms in the UK but we are aware of the threat they could pose to our native wildlife. We are currently assessing the risk and will then consider the most appropriate action.’

Jean-Lou Justine of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, said: ‘This species is extremely invasive. I really hope it can be stopped at the earliest stages,’ adding that ‘all snails in Europe could be wiped out’.
