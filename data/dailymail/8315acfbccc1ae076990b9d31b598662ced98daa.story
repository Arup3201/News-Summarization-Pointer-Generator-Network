Families will be able to live like the Darling Buds of May with plans to convert the Larkin's famous cottage into themed holiday lets.

Businessman Simon Coulson, 42, bought Buss Farm in Bethersden, Kent, last year and now plans to turn the former TV set into holiday accommodation.

Plans have been submitted to turn the £1.35 million property back to how it was when it was the base for the Larkin family in the hit 1990s TV show.

Star power: The farm was the backdrop for 1990s hit The Darling Buds of May, featuring (left to right) Pam Ferris, Sir David Jason, Catherine Zeta Jones and Philip Franks

Darling Buds of May was based on the books by H.E. Bates about the adventures of the boisterous Larkin family.

It starred David Jason, whose 
catchphrase was 'perfick', Pam Ferris and launched the career of 
Hollywood star Catherine Zeta-Jones.

Simon, an internet entrepreneur, said the project would be a real boost for Kent tourism.

He said: 'I was a fan of the programme and moved to Bethersden about six years ago almost on the strength of it because I loved the look of the area.

Prospect: Simon Coulson bought the site last year to turn the site into holiday accommodation

'I went to the classic car shows which were held at Buss Farm several times and the previous owner, Roger Holmes, told me he had people turning up asking to look round.

'I thought it was a missed opportunity. The buildings are looking rather neglected and tired.'

A planning application has been submitted to Ashford Borough Council, Kent, to renovate three buildings and turn them into holiday lets

The development will also include a complete refurb of the famous main farmhouse - which is Grade II listed.

Other buildings would be demolished, to tidy up the site, or renovated.

A new barn would be built for more holiday accommodation and a barn converted into a home.

Simon said the project could create seven full-time jobs and up to 30 part-time ones for special events such as the classic car show.

He added: 'There is still a massive following of the TV show and I thought this would be an opportunity to let people come in and see the farm.'

The main farmhouse will undergo a complete overhaul as part of the plans

Fans of the show will be able to enjoy locales frequented by the fun-loving Larkin family

The buyer visited the site on a number of occasions and thinks it has real potential as a holiday destination
