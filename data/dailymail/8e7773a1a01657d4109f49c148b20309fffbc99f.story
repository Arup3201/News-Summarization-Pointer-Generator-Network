Boris Johnson was frustrated by Lib Dem voters yesterday as he was dispatched to Eastleigh to drum up support for the Conservatives.

The London mayor toured a suburban cul-de-sac with Tory candidate Maria Hutchings - but managed to find only two Conservative voters in the area.

The mood was distinctly frosty as the pair doorstepped more than a dozen homes ahead of next Thursday's by-election in full view of TV cameras.

Campaign trail: Boris Johnson was in Eastleigh today with candidate Maria Hutchings and said their Lib Dem rivals were 'a bunch of quivering jellies'

One man refusing to shake Mr Johnson's
hand saying 'all politicians are corrupt', while others said they were 
not planning to vote or backed the Lib Dems.

Mr Johnson let the strain show, muttering 'sodding Lib Dem voter', as he left one home.

He admitted this street in Eastleigh was 'not the best of it' but insisted there were 'oodles' of Tory voters elsewhere.

Both Coalition parties see the 
Hampshire seat, vacated by the resignation of Lib Dem former cabinet 
minster Chris Huhne, as a key win.

Happy: The Mayor of London said he was not worried about upsetting the Coalition with his comments but the Tories are behind in the polls in Hampshire

Mingling: Boris Johnson visits ASDA in Chandlers Ford to campaign for Ms Hutchings in Eastleigh

Tissue for any issue: Boris Johnson and Tory candidate Maria Hutchings chat to shoppers in an ASDA car park in Eastleigh ahead of the by-election

But the by-election campaign has 
brought out sharp tensions between the governing parties, especially 
over plans to develop 1400 homes on a local golf course and farmland.

Mr Johnson said: 'This is classic 
Lib-Demery, claiming they want to protect our green spaces whilst doing 
something else altogether the minute they have even a whiff of power.'

Local Lib Dems have also seized on 
remarks by Mrs Hutchings that it would be 'impossible' to educate her 
gifted son, who hopes to be a surgeon, in a state school.

But Nick Clegg, who visited Eastleigh 
on Tuesday, is reported to be considering sending his son to 
Â£23,000-year Westminster public school, which he attended.

All smiles: The recent polls did not appear to bother Boris and Ms Hutchings

Boris was in Eastleigh to say that the Nick Clegg's party deserved a 'kicking' although the Tories are behind in the polls

Mr Johnson said: 'Nick Clegg's single 
biggest contribution to British politics is to execute the most 
spectacular u-turn anybody has ever seen on tuition fees and sing a song
about it.

'My general view is that he's a great 
big quivering jelly of indecision and invertebracy. Cameron is strong; 
he has a clear plan for the country.'

MIKE THORNTON - Liberal Democrats - 4/9

JOHN O'FARRELL - Labour - 20/1

DIANE JAMES - UKIP - 16/1

MARIA HUTCHINGS - Conservative - 9/4

Mr Clegg who visited Eastleigh earlier
in the week, has been criticised for heading abroad for a long week 
with his wife and sons in Spain.

Earlier in the day Mr Johnson's team 
swept through Asda supermarket in nearby Chandler's Ford where shoppers 
were happy to talk, but many lived in neighbouring Winchester 
constituency.

Some Tory MPs expressed dismay at how 
the campaign had been run saying it had not been focused on local issues
and that the Lib Dems - who have all 40 local councillors in the 
constituency as their members - had more activists out on the streets. 
The party claim to have leafleted every home in Eastleigh.

But a senior Tory working on the 
campaign said they had plenty of supporters flooding into the Hampshire 
seat, adding: 'There is great dissatisfaction with Chris Huhne's 
behaviour.'

UKIP scored a coup yesterday as the 
party announced former Lib Dem mayor of Eastleigh Glyn Davies-Dear had 
defected to the party.

Meeting: The pair have some fun at Hampshire Cricket Club as they prepare for next Thursday's vote - but Mr Clegg is having a holiday beforehand

Abroad: Prime Minister David Cameron is shown around the Golden Temple at Amritsar in Punjab, India, during the last day of a three day visit to the country today, but is likely to return to Eastleigh
