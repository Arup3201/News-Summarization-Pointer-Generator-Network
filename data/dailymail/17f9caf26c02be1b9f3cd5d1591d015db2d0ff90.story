England's handling of Kyle Eastmond and Semesa Rokoduguni was under scrutiny yesterday as the backs were picked to start for Bath on Saturday, despite being deemed unavailable for Test selection.

Rokoduguni played against New Zealand earlier this month, but the wing has been ruled out by the national coaches since, apparently due to a thigh injury. Centre Eastmond was again in the starting XV against South Africa last weekend, but was released to his club after suffering concussion.

However, Bath have recalled both men to face London Irish at the Madejski Stadium. Head coach Mike Ford said: ‘Roko came back to us on Monday and he was good to train. We checked him out and rehabbed him, he trained on Tuesday and I told Stuart (Lancaster) we would be picking him.

‘Stuart himself said that Kyle should be fit to play for us on Saturday and he is. He passed his concussion protocols on Thursday and he passed the Cog-Sport test today, so he’s good to go.’

Meanwhile, Saracens have named Billy Vunipola at No 8 after he was dropped and released by England earlier this week. Northampton have also made use of having some of their Test contingent back in the ranks, with Luther Burrell, Ben Foden, Stephen Myler, Lee Dickson and Calum Clark included in the Saints’ side for the Aviva Premiership match at Allianz Park.
