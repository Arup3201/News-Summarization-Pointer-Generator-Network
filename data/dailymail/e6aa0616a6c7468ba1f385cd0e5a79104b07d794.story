The Melbourne Islamic State jihadi who had his bloodied dead body posted on social media had reportedly committed a string of criminal offences before he fled to the Middle East.

New details have emerged that Suhan Rahman, who was killed while fighting in Syria last week, was sentenced to 80 hours of community service for attempting to pervert the course of justice and witness intimidation in 2013, according to The Australian.

The 23-year-old, who was previously pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar, also faced a number of charges including assault and unlicensed driving, where he was hit with a $1000 fine.

The revelation comes just less than a week after a woman claiming to be the wife posted her deceased husband Rahman on Twitter, announcing that he had been killed fighting for the IS.

His twisted wife said: ‘May Allah accept my husband, Abu Jihad al Australi.’

‘Promised Allah and fought in the front lines until he obtained shahadah,’ she added.

Rahman, who had been fighting under the name Abu Jihad al Australi, previously threatened a terrorist attack on Australia claiming he would 'bring the war home' to the west in January.

‘Spill blood young Aussies,’ he wrote on Twitter. 

His last known location was Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in Syria.

The woman, named Zumarul Jannah, who claimed to be his wife said: ‘Alhamdulillahi rabbil alimeen, I'm the most content I have ever been in my life ♡.’

The woman who claimed to be Rahman's wife said: 'I'm the most content I have ever been in my life.'

‘And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead,’ she added.

She also posted a photo of a man that looks like Rahman praying.

The 23-year-old was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar earlier this year and was also friends with playboy Melbourne jihadi Mahmoud Abdullatif.

Rahman and Abdullatif regularly conversed via Twitter before Abdullatif was reported dead in January.

In November Rahman confessed to Abdullatif it was his ‘first time using twitter its tripping out bruv [sic]’.

Abdullatif replied: ‘Lol I know I still don’t how to use it.’

‘Ye how do I retweet to others and what duz dat mean.’ Rahman asked. ‘I’ll explain when I come home insha Allah,’ Abdullatif responded.

Along with his recent postings on Twitter, Rahman also uploaded one photograph of himself wielding a high-powered silver rifle AK47.

Referencing the terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hedbo in January, where two Islamist gunmen killed editor Stéphane Charbonnier and 11 other people, Rahman wrote: 'May allah accept the french brothers who terrorised france. Allahu akbar. Day by day we will bring the war home to you.’ 

His previous posts painted a keen young reveller at Melbourne nightclubs who enjoyed partying with his mates, rap music and fast cars but in recent months, he has taken an eerie turn.

Rahman's family made a desperate plea for him to return home in January after his father Lutfur Rahman alerted authorities that he was fighting with IS, The Daily Telegraph reports.

Abdullatif and Rahman chatted about how they didn't know how to use Twitter back in November 2014 

Mr Rahman was told by the Australian Federal Police Counter-Terrorism Squad that they were monitoring his son's every movement overseas.

His father has been left distraught after learning his son's decision when he slipped out of the country with three other men to go to Syria.

'We hoped that he would never get into this type of thing,' his father has told the Daily Telegraph.

'Everything was OK then suddenly he just left the country.'
