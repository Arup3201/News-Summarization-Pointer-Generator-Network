A distraught father who barricaded himself in a hospital room over the treatment of his ill son, causing a four-hour police standoff, has surrendered.

Armed officers, state police and a SWAT team surrounded Tomball Regional Medical Center, near Houston, resulting in a four-hour stand-off with the unidentified man.

He gave himself up to police negotiators, who confirmed that he was unarmed when they took him in. He had sealed himself in the critical care unit, where his son was being treated.

The Harris County Sheriff's Office had earlier said they thought the man did have a gun - and that he had taken two hostages.

Scene: Police rushed to the Tomball Regional Hospital where the situation was unfolding Saturday night

Gearing up: A SWAT team was seen at the hospital, where the man is barricaded inside, and is thought to have a gun

Negotiators: Officers were trying to resolve the situation with a 'peaceful surrender'. The man is now believed not to have hostages 

The upset father was taken into custody at 10.45pm local time, officers said. Investigators are continuing to look into the situation, but the hospital has been taken out of lockdown. 

The confrontation with officials began around 7pm. Harris County Sheriff's officials said the man was 'distraught' but did no elaborate as to why.

Rooms next to the one where the man barricaded himself in were evacuated, but the majority of the hospital was not.

Officers on the scene told reporters that they thought the man was armed - but it later emerged he did not have any kind of weapon. 

Assembled: Multiple police vehicles had pulled up outside the complex. Sheriffs initially said a two people were being held hostage
