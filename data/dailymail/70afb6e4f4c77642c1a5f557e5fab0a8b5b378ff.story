England has been branded the divorce capital of the world with judges free to award generous payments to former partners, a survey has shown.

The flexibility given to judges presiding over divorce proceedings in England and Wales means spouses are more likely to receive generous maintenance payments than in 13 other countries, the research finds.

The survey examined spousal maintenance payments in jurisdictions across Europe, the US, South Africa and New Zealand.

New research has revealed England is the divorce capital of the world  when it comes to generous payments to ex-partners.  In 2008, Heather Mills was awarded £23.4million following her divorce from Sir Paul McCartney

The study, by City law firm Withers, revealed a wide range of issues that judges can take into account when deciding on a settlement, set England and Wales apart from other jurisdictions.

London's courts have long been earmarked as the divorce centre of the world following a raft of generous awards to ex-wives.

Generous settlements include that awarded to Heather Mills following the break down of her marriage to Sir Paul McCartney 2008. Following the four-year marriage, Miss Mills received £24.3million.

Last month Michelle Young was awarded a £20million sum after parting ways with her 'bankrupt' husband Scot Young.

In 2006 Beverley Charman, the former wife of insurance magnate John Charman was awarded a £48million settlement by the English courts in proceedings which took two years. Mr Charman appealed the decision but the pay out, which made legal history at the time, was upheld in 2007.

The businessman claimed he was penniless and could not afford to pay his ex-wife anything, prompting a bitter dispute after she alleged he was worth millions.

Suzanne Kingston, family law partner at Withers, said in other countries judges face more ridged rules dictating the affect the circumstances of the divorce has on a settlement, and the amount and duration of maintenance payments.

She said while common themes were found in the 'most basic aspects of setting maintenance' in some jurisdictions there are 'striking exceptions'.

'And of course, it is these differences that favour certain jurisdictions, such as England and Wales, ahead of others in forum rates on divorce,' Ms Kingston added.

In all the areas studied, courts had the power to order maintenance payments on the breakdown of marriage, but in Cyprus, Scotland, Germany and Switzerland, the length of time maintenance can be paid is strictly limited.

Most other jurisdictions give judges greater 'scope and independence in their decision-making' but Ms Kingston adds 'England and Wales stands out for the broad judicial discretion it applies in considering all aspects of each and every case'.

It is that freedom which 'frequently comes into play when deciding the quantum and duration of maintenance payments'.

In Germany the courts use official guidelines, the Dusseldorf Table, when deciding on the size of payments to ex-partners. The formula provides a degree of certainty and predictability in calculating maintenance.

Meanwhile the French take a more informal approach.

In many areas the concept of 'fault-based' divorce allows factors including adultery, desertion and unreasonable conduct, to be used as a reason to refuse a claim for spousal maintenance.

Ms Kingston added: 'England and Wales has an international reputation as an attractive divorce forum for the financially weaker spouse, and we should be proud of the courts’ efforts to reach a fair result in each and every case.

'However, the Law Commission is currently examining various issues in the family law arena, and changes to the law on the treatment of spousal needs, the definition of non-matrimonial property and the efficacy of prenuptial agreements are anticipated.

t will be interesting to see whether future reform impacts on the extent to which the system in England and Wales is attractive to international couples.'

The study looked at maintenance rules in California, Cyprus, England and Wales, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Jersey, Malta, New York, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland, South Africa, Spain and Switzerland.
