President Obama was today accused of 'stonewalling' after the White House refused to disclose who attended a controversial conference on 'violent extremism'.

The three-day summit has already been the focus of criticism after a repeated refusal by the president to call ISIS 'Islamic' during a speech and other remarks.

Today the row deepened as a government watchdog said the White House had a duty to disclose exactly who it had invited to the talks.

The president and federal officials this week welcomed representatives from more than 60 countries to Washington to discuss global efforts to wipe off the map extremist threats, namely ISIS and al Qaeda.

Boasting today that attendees came from every continent, speak different languages, were born of different races and ethnic groups, and belong to different religions, Obama said they were at the three-day White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism because they 'are united against the scourge of violent extremism and terrorism.'

President Barack Obama speaks at the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism at the State Department on Friday. In his speech Obama called on 'countries that are emerging and developing to create structures of governance and transparency' - even as his own administration was refusing to say who participated in the confab

Just before close of business that day the White House gave out the names of the heads of delegation to the confab. Among the attendees were Russian Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov, who announced Wednesday that he would participate

'If Russian FSB Director Bortnikov can attend the summit and know who is there, then the American people certainly deserve to know,' a government watchdog agency said Thursday

It released on Wednesday some names, but the National Security Council refused on Thursday to give Daily Mail Online a detailed list.

The State Department also sent out a list on Thursday afternoon but it didn't necessarily contain the names of all foreign officials who participated in that day's events.

A statement provided on Wednesday to reporters who cover the White House contained the names of 32 people expected to attend that day's activities - not the full audience.

It explicitly said that participants 'include' - making clear that it was a merely a partial list and not everyone it knew would attend.

Among them were Lisa Monaco, assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, Hans Bont, the mayor of Vilvoorde, in Belgium, and Robert Trestan of the Anti-Defamation League.

Daily Mail Online requested a complete record of attendees Thursday from the National Security Council. In an email exchange, a spokesperson for NSC suggested that the entire list had in fact been distributed to reporters and would not offer Daily Mail Online an additional copy.

The spokesperson also claimed that the State Department had released a list of its own on Thursday, but the Daily Mail found no evidence of that.

It was not until just before close of business on Thursday that State sent out a list of the 'heads of attending delegations' from foreign countries.

They included Russia's top spy, Alexander Bortnikov, director of Vladimir Putin's FSB.

British Home Secretary Theresa May, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Egypt Sameh Shoukry, Minister of the Interior of France Bernard Cazeneuve, and National Security Adviser to Israel Yossi Cohen were at the State Department gathering on Thursday.

Also attending were the Director-General of Counter-Terrorism for Iraq, Lieutenant General Talib Al-kenani, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense for Kuwait Khaled J M Alsabah, Minister of Foreign Affairs for Norway  Børge Brende, and Minister for Interior of Pakistan Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.

The release containing the heads of delegation came after Obama this morning called on ‘countries that are emerging and developing to create structures of governance and transparency' in a speech to foreign officials.

'The American people are owed a complete list of all persons attending the CVE summit. Anything less is an insulting stonewalling and a continuation of the Obama administration's hypocritical "transparency" policy,' Chris Farrell, director of investigations for Judicial Watch, told Daily Mail Online Thursday afternoon.

'If Russian FSB Director Bortnikov can attend the summit and know who is there, then the American people certainly deserve to know.'
