Sidra Fatima faces jail after conning seven men out of £35,000 after posing as a potential bride on a dating website

A honey trap conwoman posing as a potential bride-to-be on a dating website swindled seven men out of £35,000.

Sidra Fatima snared seven men on Asian marriage site Shaadi.com, posing as a willing and available bride 'looking for someone who knows the meaning of love'.

But the 33-year-old scarpered with the men's money and gifts they lavished on her before going through with their arrangement.

Fatima was already married and set up the scam with husband Raja Haider Ali, 45, who pretended to be her cousin or brother-in-law when he came face-to-face with their victims.

Claiming to be divorced and the mother of a child, Fatima described herself on the site as 'simple and sincere'.

She added that she was a 'simple person learning from life and finding myself, looking for someone who knows the meaning of love, someone who can touch my soul'.

In each case, Fatima arranged to meet the victim and in some instances his family while husband Ali, posing as a male relative, accompanied her.

Following their first meeting, she would agree to marriage, insisting the victim handed over money to pay for the wedding.

Prosecutor John Harrison told the jury at Bradford Crown Court the men had each stumped up a dowrie of around £5,000 each.

He said Fatima then demanded gifts for the wedding in addition to the money.

But once the money and gifts were handed over, Fatima would end the relationship either by telling the man she no longer wished to get married or by ignoring his phone calls.

Fatima, an unemployed mother-of-two, and her taxi driver husband Ali pleaded guilty part way through their trial at Bradford Crown Court on Wednesday.

After their arrests Fatima claimed she had been forced to take part in the scam by her husband while Ali suggested he was being blackmailed by his wife.

A jury heard earlier that the scams were part of a variety of fraud offences committed by the couple.

Fatima, who admitted nine counts of fraud - including seven relating to her misleading her suitors - also owned up to giving false details about her employment and income in relation to a £171,000 mortgage fraud involving a former home in Huddersfield.

The pair also admitted charges involving insurance claims for three 'staged burglaries' at the same property.

Ali, who goes under three different names, admitted six of the marriage deceptions committed  between May 2009 and January 2011.

He also admitted fraud charges in relation to money he obtained from a man who he thought would buy their house.

The jury heard Fatima, now of Dewsbury, had not worked since the couple settled in the Huddersfield area in 1999 while Ali, of Huddersfield, made a modest income as a taxi driver.

Judge Colin Burn will sentence the pair next month and bailed them with the condition they surrender their passports.

'You should both be under no illusion that the offences you committed are almost inevitably going to end in a custodial sentence,' he added.
