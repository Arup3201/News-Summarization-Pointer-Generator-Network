Hundreds of revellers gathered to give Grand National champion Neptune Collonges a hero's welcome as he returned to his home village today.

Villagers in Ditcheat in Somerset lined the sides of the road and burst into spontaneous applause as the grey champion came into view.

Neptune Collonges snatched a photo-finish victory at Aintree yesterday with jockey Daryl Jacob.

On his return home he was triumphantly taken on several tours around the small village and was met by at least 300 hundred people waiting to greet the winning team as they arrived outside The Manor House Inn village pub.

Landlord Simon D’Offay said the pub had been the hub of celebrations since yesterday’s triumph.

‘We must have sold between 40 and 50 bottles of champagne last night alone,’ he said. ‘I have been here three years and this is the busiest that I have ever seen it.’

Once the celebrations have died down, Neptune Collonges can look forward to a quieter life, as those who look after him have admitted the world’s most famous steeplechase on Merseyside would be the last race for him.

Head Lad Clifford Baker, who has tended to the horse for many years, told Sky News, ‘He is basically retired now so he won’t race again. He deserves his break – I am pleased for him.’

The horse’s triumph was marred by tragedy after Gold Cup champion and big favourite Synchronised, as well as another hot contender According to Pete, were put down after falls.

Neptune Collonges trainer Paul Nicholls admitted the deaths had overshadowed the horse’s victory a bit.

‘Instead of concentrating on what a wonderful win, we got a little bit of negative press,’ he said.

‘You just look at all these people, all the well-wishers who have come to see him and all of them watched the race. There has been some negative press but let's just enjoy the moments like this and just see how popular the whole thing was.’

Meanwhile the owner of According To Pete, Peter Nelson, said he would not be entering a horse in the Grand National again.

‘It’s terrible, he was a family pet, part of the family,’ he said. ‘Everybody’s absolutely upset. We’ve had loads of people knocking on the door. We’ve had loads of telephone calls and flowers given and bottles of wine. But all of that doesn’t bring him back, does it?’

The deaths of According To Pete and Synchronised bring the number of horses killed at the Grand National in the past 50 years to 36. Including Saturday’s deaths, 41 horses have been killed on UK racecourses this year.

Director of Animal Aid Andrew Tyler said, ‘The Grand National is a disgusting and shameful spectacle masquerading as sport.

‘There is nothing sporting about an event that routinely kills so many horses. For anyone who genuinely cares about horses, watching this race was an utterly depressing and melancholy experience.’

Julian Thick, managing director of Aintree Racecourse, said: ‘We are desperately sad at these two accidents and our sympathies are with the connections of both.

‘Since last year's race we have made further significant changes to the course and there have been four races run over the course without serious incident since then. We will, as always, be looking at all aspects of this year's race to see how we can improve safety further.’

Two of the jockeys who took part in yesterday’s race also suffered injuries, it was confirmed today.

Irish jockey Noel Fehily fractured his right leg in three places after falling from State of Play, while Brian Hughes suffered facial injuries – possibly a fractured cheekbone – when he fell from Viking Blond at the first fence.
