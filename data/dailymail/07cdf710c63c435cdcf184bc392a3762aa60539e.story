Nine women in Sweden have received womb transplants and will soon try to conceive. Derya Sert (pictured), from Turkey, had a transplant in August 2011 and subsequently conceived but she miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy

The first baby from a donor womb could be born next year after nine childless women received transplants.

The women, who were born without a womb or had it removed due to cancer, received organs donated by close relatives.

They will soon try to become pregnant through IVF in a pioneering trial in Sweden that gives hope to thousands of childless women in the UK.

The new wombs, taken from a mother or other living relative who has completed her family, will not only allow the women to experience the joys of pregnancy but will mean they have babies that are genetically their own.

Those whose mother was the donor will be using the womb that carried them for nine months to carry their baby.

The groundbreaking transplants bring hope to at least 15,000 British women of childbearing age. However, the method is controversial because it involves taking wombs from living donors. The Swedish team favours it because the organs are generally in better condition and a better immunological match.

Other surgeons in the same field do not believe it is right to put a living donor through such a major operation when it is not  life-saving. They say the best option is to use an organ from a dead donor. This allows them to transplant extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy.

Dr Mats Brannstrom, of the University 
of Gothenburg, who spent more than a decade perfecting the complex 
surgical techniques needed, said: ‘This is a new kind of surgery.’

He
 added that the women who received new wombs are doing well and will 
soon try to become pregnant using IVF – but there are no guarantees of 
success.

Richard Smith, head
 of Womb Transplant UK, says the charity is ready to give five British 
women wombs from dead donors, subject to receiving ethical clearance  
and raising the £500,000 required to cover the cost of surgery. ‘We are 
good to go, save for the fact we haven’t got any money,’ he said.

Mr
 Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon, described the Swedish 
breakthrough as ‘amazing’ and said a successful birth would bolster 
similar projects around the world. Any babies the Swedish women bear are
 likely to be delivered by caesarean section and the new wombs will be 
removed after only one or two pregnancies.

The
 women are on powerful immunosuppressant drugs but the biggest worry is 
how well a transplanted womb will cope with the strains of pregnancy, 
during which the womb swells from the size of a pear to that of a melon.
 Critics question the process, with fertility expert Lord Winston saying
 the risks are too great and some women should accept that they will 
never bear children.

The women will not be able to conceive naturally as their wombs are not connected to their fallopian tubes. They will have IVF treatment to allow them to become pregnant with embryos they previously had frozen

Those in favour say it is the only way for some women to fulfil their deep-seated yearning to have a baby.

Experts say the operations will only be considered a success on the birth of a healthy baby.

Dr
 Yacoub Khalaf, medical director of the Assisted Conception unit at 
Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital in London, said: ‘What remains to be seen 
is whether this is a viable option or if this is going to be confined to
 research and limited experimentation.’

The
 world’s first womb transplant took place in Saudi Arabia in 2000. 
However, the woman’s body rejected the donated organ after four months.

Turkish doctors performed a successful transplant in 2011, but patient Derya Sert lost her baby during pregnancy last year.

The women were either born without a womb or had theirs removed because of cervical cancer - they received the transplants from living relatives

@highlight

They will now have IVF treatment to implant embryos into their wombs

They are not able to conceive naturally as the wombs were not connected to their fallopian tubes - but they have previously had embryos frozen

Previous attempts to transplant a womb - one in Saudi Arabia and one in Turkey - both failed to produce a baby but the Turkish woman did conceive

She later had a miscarriage after two months of pregnancy
