Fitbit's new range includes the $129 fitbit charge, the $149 chargeHR while also has a heart rate sensors, and the $249 Surge which has GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality.

If given the choice, would you rather a Fitbit smartwatch or an Apple watch?

'Featuring 8-sensor technology that combines all-day fitness tracking with GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality.

'Surge is ideal for users committed to training, dedicated to health and consistently looking to improve progress.' 

Earlier this month details were revealed in marketing materials leaked to website's Chris Welch by a ‘tipster’.

Other features of the wristband include a more advanced sleep tracker, and a silent alarm that wakes wearers up using vibrations.

Current FitBit models track runners using the GPS on a connected phone. 

The Charge is a new version of the Force.

Fitbit describes it as a 'high-performance wristband that delivers all-day activity tracking, real-time fitness stats and Caller ID right on the wrist for people who want to step up their everyday activities to improve their overall health.

It can track steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned and floors climbed

The $129 fitbit charge is available from today

Automatic sleep detection monitors sleep quality using motion analysis to understand sleep and wake times; also features a silent, vibrating alarm

Caller ID to helps users stay connected to incoming calls; the wristband vibrates and shows the caller’s name or number when a smartphone is nearby

Exercise tracking to easily record workouts, see real-time exercise stats and have summaries appear automatically on the Fitbit dashboard.

The $149 Charge HR will be available next year

The Charge HR adds Fitbit’s proprietary PurePulse optical heart rate technology, which provides continuous and automatic wrist-based heart rate monitoring, without an uncomfortable chest strap.

PurePulse uses safe LED lights to detect blood volume changes right on the wrist to deliver heart rate monitoring 24/7.

It was rumoured that the Californian firm would release a standalone heart rate monitor called PurePulse, but this technology has been built into the new products. 

This is expected to provide real-time workout data, and statistics - including heart rate, calories, steps, pace, elevation and distance - will sync wirelessly to a smartphone via an app.

And the leaked reports revealed the watch will be available in black, grey and orange.

These were revealed in a patent application, filed earlier this year, which detailed a wearable device called FitBit Charge that includes, among other features: ‘Pedometers; altimeters;  devices for displaying [and] measuring, time, date, steps taken, calories burned, distance travelled, floors climbed, active time, elevation, altitude, speed, pace, hours slept, quality of sleep, heart rate, routes, navigational information, and weather information.'

The fitbit Surge will compete against Apple's smartwatch

The application also continued that Fitbit's patented devices will link to phones to 'control volume and notify users of incoming calls or messages.'

This suggests the devices will feature ‘smart’ notifications, including call and text notifications, on the wrist, and will let wearers control music from their wrist – in a bid to take on smartwatches.
