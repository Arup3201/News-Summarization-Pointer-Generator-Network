Barcelona returned to training on Wednesday just a day after losing 3-2 to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.

The Catalan giants - who were unbeaten under new boss Luis Enrqiue until Tuesday's Champions League defeat - were put through their paces at the club's training ground less than 24 hours after playing in the French capital.

Luis Suarez, who is still banned after appearing to bite Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, was also present for the training session.

Manager Enrique will be hoping Barcelona return to winning ways swiftly against Rayo Vallecano in La Liga on Saturday.

Goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who is yet to concede a goal since arriving from Real Sociedad in the summer, was left on the bench as Marc-Andre ter Stegen was preferred between the sticks for Tuesday's Group F encounter. 

Barcelona, who won the Champions League in 2011, went a goal down after just ten minutes as David Luiz struck to give PSG the lead. However, the lead lasted just a minute as Lionel Messi levelled the scores.

Laurent Blanc's side lead 2-1 at half-time courtesy of Marco Verratti and extended their lead through Blaise Matuidi.

Neymar pulled a goal back for Barcelona just two minutes later but the La Liga side were unable to find an equaliser as PSG held on for all three points - without the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic - to top the group.
