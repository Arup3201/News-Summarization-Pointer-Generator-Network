The Duchess of Cambridge may have access to a collection of dazzling jewels that date back hundreds of years but the royal prefers to stay true to the designers she's championed for years.

Last night was case in point as she stepped out at the Royal Variety performance in a dazzling pair of Lola Blue Topaz Hoops by Kiki McDonough.

The £3,200 earrings comes in 18ct white gold and promise to add a splash of colour to any outfit.

Kate is a loyal fan of the brand and has been spotted at various royal outings wearing the bold designs by the Chelsea-based designer.

Speaking about Kate, Kiki, who's been designing pieces of jewellery for around for 25 years, told MailOnline: 'She wears my pieces as they should be worn. She obviously enjoys wearing colour on her ears as opposed to pearls and diamonds all the time.'

Kiki thinks the earrings complemented the black Diane Von Furstenberg dress 'beautifully' last night by adding some colour.

Staying true to her thrifty reputation, Kate  has previously worn them with a pale blue coat dress to the Olympic Opening Ceremony reception and on another occasion with a lavender cocktail dress.

'My jewellery is very wearable so it is easy for her to put it with jeans, skirts and dresses - so it is suitable for every occasion,' added Kiki.

Intriguingly, Kiki's designs were once worn by William’s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, as well as the likes of actresses Rosamund Pike and Emilia Fox. 

Kiki thinks Kate is an ideal customer. She said: 'She is a busy working mother like me, and I design jewellery that goes with that lifestyle. My designs have always reflected the way we live now, dashing from work to an event.

'I will quite often keep the same pair of earrings on for a week and they go with me wherever I am going (from the theatre to a football match) and that seems to be something that my clients appreciate.'

Kiki's collection aims to showcase her love of vibrant colour and wearable designs and she always uses the most vibrant semi precious stones in daring colour combinations, which Kate clearly loves.

'I like to see ordinary, stylish women who appreciate fine jewellery that they can wear all the time wearing my piece. They don’t have to be celebrities,' she added.

Undoubtedly the best-known item in Kate's jewellery collection is her £28,500 engagement ring, which once belonged to Princess Diana. The blue sapphire, which sparkles with 14 diamonds, was bought at the former Crown jewellers Garrard of Mayfair for a staggering £28,500.

When it comes to choosing her own accessories, Kate does, however, prefer more simple pieces like her £1,090 Annoushka Pearl Drop earrings and more modest £275 Links Hope earrings.

She's even a fan of cheap but chic jewellery, which she snapped up from Made In Chelsea star Amber Atherton's myflashtrash website and wore while on her Diamond Jubilee tour of the South Pacific.

Kate hand-picked seven different pieces, including earrings, bracelets, and necklaces, from the company that is run by the E4 reality TV star.

Founder Amber told MailOnline: 'We are over the moon that Kate has been supporting British business by wearing trinkets from myflashtrash.com.'

In 2012, Kate wore a delicate pair of imitation diamond-and-pearl earrings to the Diamond Jubilee service at St Paul’s Cathedral.

The £48 fake pearl and cubic zirconia earrings were part of a range of jewellery sold on her website Heavenly Necklaces - an online business selling convincing, understated fake jewels.
