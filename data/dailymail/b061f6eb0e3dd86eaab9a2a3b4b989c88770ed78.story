If you’ve ever wondered what it would feel like to walk up your very own stone staircase and hear your footsteps echo around a castle every day, then this could be your chance.

From its period fireplaces to authentic ironwork and antique furniture, a tower where monks plotted to reverse the Scottish Reformation is offering buyers a slice of the high-life for less than £600,000.

Abbots Tower, which is located in New Abbey, Dumfries, was built around 1580 in the latest French ‘chateau’ style, now known as Scottish Renaissance, with pepperpot turrets and candlesnuffer roofs.

Life-changing property: Abbots Tower, which is located in New Abbey, Dumfries, was built around 1580

Outstanding: The tower features a double planked clenched oak entrance door with handmade ironwork, stone staircases, gunloop windows, exposed beams, original wooden floors and period fireplaces

Beautiful: The accommodation lies over four floors, accessible by stone turnpike staircases leading up the tower. The kitchen has a hand-crafted island bench, antique dresser, a range cooker and Belfast sink

Restoration: This could be your chance to walk up your very own stone staircase and hear your footsteps echo around a tower

Bathroom: There are four bedrooms within the tower over the four floors, and the master bedroom has an original fireplace, exposed beams and a window seat - as well as an en-suite

The home, which also features crow-stepped gables and wide spiral staircases, was built by a John Broun, who died in 1613. His son Cuthbert fell on hard times and eventually mortgaged the estate.

By 1627 it was owned by John Hay of Edinburgh, before it was abandoned as a residence around this time and gradually fell into disrepair. Restoration began in 1990 and took two decades to finish.

The current restoration includes a painted ceiling - popular in Scotland during the reign of James VI.

Plenty to see: A formal room on the third-floor has extensive views, including sight of Skiddaw in the Peak District on a clear day. A 'secret' staircase leads to the Garret which is currently used as an attic bedroom

Rooms with a view: The village of New Abbey in which the tower is set was built around the 13th century Sweetheart Abbey, founded by Lady Devorgilla in 1283 to commemorate the death of her husband

The accommodation lies on four floors, accessible by stone turnpike staircases leading up the tower.

Gilbert Broun, the last abbot of the nearby Sweetheart Abbey, is said to have used Abbots Tower as a base for his efforts to reverse the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century.

The European Reformation began in 1517 when German monk Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to a church door in Wittenberg.

He rejected the Pope's authority and all of the Church's practices not written in the Bible.

His ideas soon spiralled into the Protestant movement, and many Scots were impressed by this when Lutheran books began to appear in their Catholic country in the 1520s.

England converted to Protestantism in 1534, before Scotland broke from the Catholic Church in 1560 and banned Mass being held.

Abbot Broun fought the reformists, fortifying his abbey and continuing to celebrate Mass there. He was imprisoned, exiled and died in Paris.

The village of New Abbey in which it is set was built around the 13th century Sweetheart Abbey, founded by Lady Devorgilla in 1283 to commemorate the death of her husband - the former King of Scotland, John Balliol.

From then, the order of Cistercian Monks who occupied the abbey named it 'dulce cor', meaning 'sweet heart' in Latin.
