DNAinfo Chicago reported that police with the Town Hall Police District stated that the SUV was stolen and its driver is now in custody.

Cometas Dilanjian, told DNAinfo Chicago, president of the cab company City Service, said the cab driver told him the SUV refused to stop and give information.

He said the SUV caused more than $3,000 worth of damage to the cab alone and the driver has to pay a $500 insurance deductible and is missing at least a week's worth of work due to the damage.

He said the driver has been disciplined for confronting the SUV driver.

'There's no reason why things like this should escalate,' Mr Dilanjian said. 'That's how people get hurt.'
