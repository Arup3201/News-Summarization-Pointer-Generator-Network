Neiman Marcus customers look to be the latest victims of hackers targeting credit card information from big retail chains.

The Dallas-based retailer confirmed on Friday it had a cyber security breach in mid-December and an undisclosed number of customers' cards were compromised.

It is not yet known how many people have been affected, according to ABC Local.

The company says it is taking the necessary steps to notify customers with cards that have definitely been used frequently.

Compromised: Upmarket department store Neiman Marcus has been forced to admit they have had a credit card data breach after the story was unearthed on Friday

Much like Target, who have confirmed some 70 million customers of their customers were affected by a hacking scandal in December, Neimen Marcus say it is only in-store shoppers, not online shoppers, that have been vulnerable to the data breach

Neiman Marcus issued the following statement over the issue.

'We informed federal law enforcement agencies and are working actively with the U.S. Secret Service, the payment brands, our credit card processor, a leading investigations, intelligence and risk management firm, and a leading forensics firm to investigate the situation,' the statement said.

The hack was unearthed by independent security researcher Brian Krebs reported on Friday.

The news comes on the same day that Target announced its December security breach may have affected as many as 70 million customers - not the 40 million it initially had estimated.

Interestingly, the Neiman Marcus data breach happened at the same time as the Target scandal - mid-December.

Upscale retailer Neiman Marcus isn't yet saying how many customers might be at risk, but it is confirming that a breach of credit card data took place.

Also like Target, online shoppers don't seem to be affected, just in-store customers.

Neiman Marcus says it's started to contain the intrusion and is taking 'significant' steps to enhance its information security.

'The security of our customers' information is always a priority and we sincerely regret any inconvenience,' the statement said.

'We are taking steps, where possible, to notify customers whose cards we know were used fraudulently after making a purchase at our store.'

'Earlier this week, I began hearing from sources in the financial industry about an increasing number of fraudulent credit and debit card charges that were being traced to cards that had been very recently used at brick-and-mortar stores run by the Dallas, Texas based high-end retail chain,' Krebs wrote.
