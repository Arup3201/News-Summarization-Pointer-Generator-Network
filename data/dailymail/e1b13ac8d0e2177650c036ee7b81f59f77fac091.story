More than 100 members of far-right group the English Defence League gathered near the scene of the suspected terrorist attack last night.

Many were draped in St George’s flags and wore black balaclavas with the EDL logo on.

Riot police holding shields formed a cordon around the area as the EDL members waved flags and chanted 'no surrender to the Muslim scum', ‘Rule Britannia’ and ‘England’.

EDL leader Stephen Lennon - who goes by the name Tommy Robinson - addressed the 
crowd, saying: 'We have got weak leadership. They have allowed this to 
happen. People are scared to say the word Muslim. They are scared to 
offend them.

‘You know what? We are offended. People in this country are angry. They have had enough.’

They marched threw bottles at police before being dispersed by officers by 11pm.

A number of EDL supporters then headed to the local Queen’s Arms pub where they sang nationalistic songs.

Onlookers said a brick was thrown through a mosque window during the march.

A man, who gave his name only as 
Abdul, said: 'I'm not happy about it. It's a place of worship - a place 
of God. They have got Islam all wrong. The people who did this are 
nothing to do with the real Islam.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said he was not aware of any arrests at the protest.

Elsewhere, two men were arrested in separate alleged ‘revenge attacks’ on mosques following yesterday’s killing.

A 43-year-old man who reportedly 
walked into a mosque in Braintree, Essex, with up to two knives and an 
‘incendiary device’ was arrested at 7.15pm on suspicion of possession of
 an offensive weapon and attempted arson.

The man reportedly shouted 'Where is your Allah now?!' after bursting into the mosque and throwing an item which appeared to be a smoke grenade.

Vandalism: The Masjid Usman mosque in Bolton was targeted overnight

Spray paint: Vandals painted slogans on a car parked outside the mosque

Bolton: The mosque targeted by vandals is more than 200 miles from the scene of the attacks in London

The secretary of the Al Falah Braintree Islamic Centre, Sikander Saleemy, told Channel 4 News: 'The police said it's 
too early to try and link it to what happened in Woolwich, but those of 
us who were here feel that it was some sort of revenge attack.

'It was 
clear from the man's behaviour. We absolutely condemn what happened in 
Woolwich, but it had nothing to do with us.

'It was an appalling act of terror - 
but it wasn't "Islamic" in any way. I wish it wasn't described like 
that, because sadly people will now start to blame Muslims.'

'Local mosque in Braintree attacked by man with knives and incendiary device. Man arrested. No one injured'

Brooks Newmark, Braintree MP

It was reported the man started 
banging on the door at 7.25pm, shortly before evening prayer, shouting 
'I want to slit your throats'.

According to Mr Saleemy, only one worshipper was inside and he escaped through a window onto the roof.

Brooks Newmark, the local MP who reported the incident on his Twitter account, said: 'We cannot allow acts like that to drive us apart.'

More than 200 miles away in Bolton, 
Greater Manchester, a mosque was covered in graffiti by vandals in the 
hours following the Woolwich attack.

Phrases
 including 'Islam = evil' and 'terrorist training camp' were daubed on 
the outside of the mosque in red spray paint, while a nearby car had 
similar graffiti and the words 'terrorists inside' sprayed on.

Abdul Rauf, secretary of the Masjid Usman mosque, said the community was worried about further incidents.

He said: 'It has been a massive shock. Nothing like this has ever happened at the mosque before. We are all upset and we don't know if something else might happen. 

'We discovered the graffiti when we came to open this morning and rang the police straight away.

'The incident in London is nothing to with our mosque or Muslims in this
 country. I know people are upset but they should not target local 
Muslims.'

Speaking
 in Downing Street today, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'We will 
defeat violent extremism by standing together, by backing our police and
 security services and above all by challenging the poisonous narrative 
of extremism on which this violence feeds.'

Hoodie: A Help for Heroes top like the one the murdered soldier was wearing

The soldier killed by two crazed 
fanatics just yards from the Woolwich Barracks was wearing a Help for 
Heroes top when he was attacked.

The
 young serviceman was hit by a car and crushed into a road sign on the 
street in south-east London before he was brutally murdered.

Video
 footage showed the dead man was wearing a dark blue top with white 
writing on it - which is believed to be the same as the Help for Heroes 
hoodie (right).

The killers
 attacked him with a collection of weapons including meat cleavers and 
knives before waiting for police to arrive, their hands covered in 
blood.

Today members of the public were donating to the charity which helps wounded troops with their rehabilitation.

One
 man called Allan Beattie who donated to the charity wrote: 'In memory 
of the soldier brutally murdered yesterday - rest in peace - and a thank
 you to all of our brave service men and women who do so much for us'

Kelly
 Alexander, who also gave to the charity wrote: 'Last night a black 
cloud went over our country,it will never be the same again,Rip to this 
young man brutally slain in his home country.I salute you x'
