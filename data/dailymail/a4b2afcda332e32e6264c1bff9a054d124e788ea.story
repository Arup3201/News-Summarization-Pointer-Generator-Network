First there was the cronut, a calorific hybrid of doughnut and croissant which had sugar lovers across the world queuing outside bakeries for hours. 

And now two chefs have combined forces, and flavours, to create what they think might just be the next big thing in pastries - a doughnut filled with stewed beef. 

John Barrett and Ben Dass from Bristol have been perfecting their recipe for the 'moonut' for almost a year after the former was made redundant.

The moonut is a paprika-dusted doughnut filled with Guiness-stewed beef shin and shitaki mushrooms

'It was a bit of a gimmick to start, but as it turns out, it actually tastes quite good,' the 33-year-old said. 

After establishing themselves as The Feastie Boys, the pair tried a number of different combinations to no avail. 

'Back when we were thinking about making the business we were playing around with doughnuts and we decided to try to make something savoury.

'It's been trial and error. There have been some pretty serious fails - like the cheese and bacon one which was truly foul.' 

But the moonut, made with Guiness-stewed beef shin, has taken off.   

The chefs from Bristol sell their goods at Temple Quay Market every second and fourth Thursday in the month

After numerous failed attempts, they are happy to have come up with something they think the public will enjoy 

The chefs were inspired by the success of the cronut (pictured) - a combination of a doughnut and croissant 

'This one works because rather than having sugar on the outside we use powdered shitaki mushrooms and a dusting of paprika.

'It's been a mixed reaction. Some people have been really interested in it and others have just said "what?"'.

'But the feedback from everyone who has tried them has been really good.'

The moonut is sold every second and fourth Thursday at Bristol Temple Quay Market, and costs £3.50. 

It is sold alongside other locally sourced goods prepared by The Feastie Boys.
