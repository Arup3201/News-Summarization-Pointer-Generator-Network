They quashed speculation their relationship is on the rocks after throwing a star-studded Christmas party with a guest list to rival the Oscars.

And after putting their wedding on hold, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are now vowing to spend more time together in 2014  -  having even attended counseling sessions, MailOnline can reveal.

After being separated for work over the past few months, the couple have now made plans for a New Year sunshine break in Mexico.

A source said: 'Jen and Justin love each other, they are fully commited. they had hoped to be married by now but work commitments this year meant their plans went astray.

'They have had some counseling. They both regret not spending more time together this year and they're determined that next year will be different.'

What split? Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux quashed rumours their relationship is on the rocks as they attended a Christmas get-together at good friends Emily Blunt and John Krasinski's LA home on Saturday

Committed: Jennifer Aniston and fiance Justin Theroux, seen together in September, will spend New Year in Mexico

The couple recently moved into their newly renovated $21million Bel Air residence - where they threw a holiday bash earlier this month - but a friend said that Jennifer has conceded she will set up camp in New York when Justin begins filming HBO series The Leftovers next spring.

Their continuing closeness could be seen as Justin, 42, dropped, former Friends star Jennifer, 44,  off at pal Emily Blunt's baby shower in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon - stopping in to say hi to the Brit actress before picking up his fiancee a few hours later.

Engaged since August 2012, they have been discussing wedding plans, as the source said: 'Jen and Justin are looking at it like it's a party for their friends. They've downgraded the scale of their wedding.

'Justin is adamant it will happen in 2014 but that it will
 be more 'spontaneous and organic ' than they'd previously wanted.'

While promoting her movie, We're The Millers, this summer, Jennifer insisted: 'We already feel married,' adding: 'We're really just happy and in love.'

Interestingly, Jennifer is believed to have taken advice from Gwyneth Paltrow - who dated her ex-husband Brad Pitt before she married him - after the Oscar winner managed to pull off a quiet, no-fuss wedding to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin a decade ago.

Gwyneth and Chris attended Jennifer and Justin's holiday party alongside friends including Courteney Cox, Chelsea Handler, Robert Downey Jr., Kathryn Hahn, Jason Bateman, Tobey Maguire, Isla Fisher and Will Arnett.

Although Jennifer will spend Christmas with family in LA and Justin will be on the East Coast with his family, they will see in the New Year together in Jennifer's favourite vacation spot, Cabo St Lucas.

The pair vacationed in the same spot last December with Devil Wears Prada star Emily - now six-months-pregnant - and husband, Office actor John Krazinski, alongside Jimmy Kimmel and his wife Molly McNearney.

Expecting: Pregnant actress Emily Blunt keeps up her fitness by taking her dog for a hike in Hollywood on Saturday

Something to smile about: The couple arrived at the house each carrying a small present wrapped in lilac paper with a white bow on top before leaving a little while later with Jen in particular looking to be in good spirits

Jennifer joined a star-studded guest list at Emily's baby bash, including Kristen Bell and Amy Adams.

A source told US Weekly that despite the obvious star power, the shower was 'very small and intimate', with only about 15 guests.

'It was an intimate shower for a few close girlfriends,' an eyewitness said: 'It was very small and low key.'

Snacks and Perrier water were provided for the attendees, according to the magazine, and pink balloons decorated Emily's Hollywood Hills home. There was also a raspberry fruit cake tart for dessert, and each of the guests gave a little toast to the mom-to-be, raising glasses of Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label to her.

Things started winding down around sunset, the eyewitness noted: 'Jennifer Aniston was greeted by Justin Theroux, who came back to pick her up. She was the first guest to leave. Everyone else left soon after.'

Earlier that day, the 30-year-old mom-to-be enjoyed a hike at Hollywood's Runyon Canyon with her dog as she stays in tip-top shape during her pregnancy.

Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night: Despite the visors of their Mercedes-Benz partially obscuring their faces, it was obvious from their smiles that both had had an enjoyable afternoon as they headed home as night began to fall

Who needs a reason to party! While their hostess is pregnant with her first child, it seems unlikely the friends were celebrating the impending birth as she is only six months along, instead probably a festive catch-up and exchanging of gifts

House Of Lies star Kristen Bell, who welcomed her first child, daughter Lincoln, on March 28, arrived bearing a gift.

The 33-year-old flew solo, leaving Parenthood star husband Dax Shepard, whom she wed on October 17, to care for their daughter.

Stylish entrance: Actress Kristen Bell was also invited to the soirÃ©e and arrived looking glamorous in deep plum leather pants, brown ankle boots, a white blouse and cream and navy blue colourblock coat
