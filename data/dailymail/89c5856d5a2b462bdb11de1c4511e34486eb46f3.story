Just days after staff at a Florida Dunkin' Donuts were berated by a disgustingly rude customer, a man has been caught on tape delivering a vicious spray of abuse to a poor Wendy's drive-thru cashier because someone put cheese in his hamburger.

The footage shows the belligerent customer banging the ledge outside a drive-thru window aggressively with his fist as he yells at the attendant, who, while not visible in the video, is sure to be a third of his age.

'I need my money back and I want it fast,' the angry man screams. 'Is there cheese in hamburger? There is no cheese in hamburger. When you have a cheeseburger you have a cheeseburger, when you have hamburger you have a hamburger.'

Rude: The vile customer, pictured, is caught on tape abusing Wendy's staff over his wrong order

The shocking confrontation was filmed and posted on YouTube by Jacob Donnelly, who appears to be sitting in a car behind the indignant customer.

'I want my money back, I want it back now and I want it fast,' the vile man continues, getting increasingly worked up at the cashier who almost certainly didn't make his meal.

'There's not even bacon on this, or onion on this, there's not anything that I asked for. This is such incompetence and it happens every time I come here.'

When the worker appears to try to calm him down, the man barks, again banging his fists in a threatening manner: 'I am losing my s*** because this happened the past three times I've come. Please be competent for once in your life. Once. Take an order and fill it.'

He is then given back his money, as requested, and the attendant quickly shuts the window, probably fearing a punch in the face. But even then the customer is not content.

'... damn it, I paid more than this, I want ten bucks you G** damn sons of b****es, G** damn sons of b****es,' he yells before storming off into the night.

Threatening: The poor cashier, who is probably a teenager and almost certainly didn't make the man's meal, is dished a vicious spray of abuse

Wendy's: The incident occurred at a Wendy's, thought it's unclear where it was located

Donnelly praised the poor Wendy's staff in a comment underneath the video, which has garnered more than 55,000 views since it was uploaded on June 13.

'Props to the hard working folks at Wendy's for showing restraint when this whack job loses his mind over a wrong order,' he said.

The disgusting behavior comes hot on the heels of 27-year-old Taylor Chapman's disgraceful tirade. The Broward County woman filmed herself abusing Dunkin' Donuts employees in an apparent attempt to exact some kind of consumer justice.

Chapman, however, only succeeds in appearing rude, ignorant and racist in the video, which she posted on her Facebook page.

The imagined slight occurred the night prior, when a Dunkin' Donuts employee apparently forgot to print Chapman's receipt. In what Chapman seems to have construed as a mortal insult, the employee offered Chapman her entire order free the next time she entered the store to make up for the oversight.

This more than generous offer 
apparently boiled Chapman's blood, and she entered the fast food outlet 
the next day armed with a camera phone and a bad attitude.

To the credit of Dunkin' Donuts 
staff, they are unfailingly polite to Chapman, despite the insults, 
swearing and racial slurs spat at them.

In
 between orders of bacon and cheese croissants (bacon extra crispy), 
iced coffee with extra cream and extra sugar and a Strawberry Coolatta, 
which Chapman mistakenly thinks the workers have forgotten.

The
 eight minute and nine second ordeal begins with Chapman warning the 
male employee who serves her, 'This is all being under video 
surveillance, OK?'

She then
 tells him her complaint: That a female employee the night before forgot
 to print out her receipt and then 'turned into a complete rude b*tch'.

She
 neglects to explain exactly how the employee did her wrong though. 'She
 told me, OK, you can get your order free next time. So you know what I 
told her? I want the whole f****n' menu, b***h. Twice.'

According to Chapman, her lawyer is 
'already on it' and she says she'd spoken to someone from the store 
earlier that day who told her she could have her order free.

The
 employee explains that he doesn't know what happened the night before 
but reassures Chapman he's happy to give her what she wants.

She begins to order, asking for the Strawberry Coolatta, which she admits was not one of the items she ordered the day before.

Chapman tells a fellow customer, 'I just want my bacon crispy and my people nice, you know?'

'Cos
 I literally thought this was the best one in the city, and I gave you 
guys so many good, like, remarks online because I have a business degree
 and, like, I really did until that b***h just completely p****d me 
off,' she explains, reasonably.

Chapman attempts to engage her fellow customers in the video, but they aren't forthcoming.

'That's
 your issue,' says one man. 'I've got my own issues.' A receipt ain't 
one, though, as he tells Chapman that he is always given his receipt at 
Dunkin' Donuts.

'I'm from Indiana in Kentucky,' 
Chapman tells the man, 'And up there this s**t doesn't happen,' she 
says, but goes on to mention that 'One time they p*ssed in my fries 
where I'm from at home. Literally I could smell the p*ss.'

Viral: Before making her obscene Dunkin' Donuts video, Chapman's YouTube channel was devoted to marketing videos, including this one for Happy Wok

'So I know they're probably sh*ttin' and p*ssin in it, because they really don't give a sh*t,' she says loudly.

'That's why I'm not eating this food, I'm giving it to my boyfriend.'

The worst is yet to come, though, when Chapman spies the woman she believed was rude to her the night before.

'Well, guess what? This s**t’s about to go live, b***h. Right on Facebook,' she rants.

'Cause I already posted what your dumb ass did last night. So I hope 
you’re happy with your little f****g sand n****r self. Cause I’m about 
to nuke your whole f****g planet from Mars. You think ya’ll are tough 
big fat Arabs bombin’ the Trade Center? I’ll show you tough,' she yells 
to the woman, who calmly goes about her business behind the counter.

Chapman's LinkedIn profile says she's currently the marketing manager for Comfort Care Medical Equipment, but according to The Smoking Gun the company says she hasn't worked there for more than a year.

Chapman,
 whose LinkedIn profile says she went to Nova Southeastern University in
 Orlando, also has a YouTube channel on which she has posted numerous 
marketing videos of low production quality.

Expressing her excitement at posting the
 video, she says, 'Hi Facebook, this is what you have to do in life, it 
f*****g sucks. Blow my brains out,' a sentiment shared by many who have 
seen the video.
