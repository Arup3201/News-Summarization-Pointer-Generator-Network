New York Giants' cornerback Prince Amukamara is enjoying his best season yet - and defensive back Antrel Rolle thinks he knows why.

Rolle told NJ.com that it's no coincidence that Amukamara, a devout Catholic who previously said he would abstain from sex until marriage, is playing so well just months after getting hitched. 

'He's married, so he's (enjoying some things that he wasn't experiencing before he's married),' he said.

'For a man, that could definitely help him out... He walks around with a little more swagger, which is something that we need, which is something that we love.'

Wedded bliss: Prince Amukamara, a devout Christian who said he wanted to abstain from sex until marriage, wed wife Pilar earlier this year and since, he has been playing better than ever

Whatever the cause, it's paying off. In  four games, Amukamara, who was picked in the first round of the 2011 draft, has already set a career high with two interceptions, as well as 25 tackles.

'When he goes out there playing, you definitely see him being more aggressive, capitalizing on his opportunities and he's accepting challenges. He's winning those challenges,' Rolle said.

His coaches said that the 25-year-old has shown steady improvement in his four-year career.

'Prince is a young man who's improved year in and year out,' coach Tom Coughlin said last week. 'And he's improved this past year to this point.'

He would not say outright that having sex was responsible for his latest boost.

Together: They met    at a Manhattan nightclub and he initially did not tell Pilar that he was a footballer player

'He's just developing more as a man and accepting challenges and being the dominant player that we need him to be that we know he's capable of,' Coughlin said.

Amukamara, who hails from Nigeria, has always been open about waiting for marriage before having sex. He also does not drink alcohol.

In an interview with Muscle & Fitness last year, he revealed that his clean lifestyle led some of his teammates to call him 'the black Tim Tebow' after his fellow Christian NFL player.

He met his now-wife Pilar in a Manhattan nightclub three years ago. In the interview, he said that even though his friends were encouraging him to talk to her, he wasn't sure what to say.

Later on, she walked past and he stated talking with her.

'I asked her for her e-mail address because when someone asks for your number, it might be too personal and you might not want to give it,' he said. 'But if you ask for their e-mail address, they'll give it. I was right.'

But he admitted that he initially hid his job from her.

He told the magazine that he has pretended to be a construction worker or a manager at Gap when meeting people in the past - and one teammate has even claimed to be an astronaut.

He added that he realized he had to tell Davis the truth when the Giants went to San Francisco for the conference championship. He knew he would have to come clean if he wanted her to visit him.

'So two days later, I said "Hey, I play for the Giants",' he recalled. 'She thought I meant San Francisco Giants. That's when I thought she might be a keeper.'

He proposed to her on stage at a Jabbawockeez show at Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 19 last year and they married in Phoenix, Arizona in February.
