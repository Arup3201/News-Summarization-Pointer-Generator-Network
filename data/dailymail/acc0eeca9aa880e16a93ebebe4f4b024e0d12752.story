He is regarded as one of Britain’s greatest inventors after creating the wind-up radio in the 1990s.

But 20 years on, Trevor Baylis says he is ‘totally broke’ and has to sell his beloved home.

Despite the success of the wind-up radio, the 75-year-old says he has received very little of the profits.

Trevor Baylis, pictured in his workshop at his home on Eel Pie Island, Twickenham, said despite the success of his wind-up radio invention he is now living in poverty and will now need to sell or remortgage his beloved home

He claims a quirk in patent law meant
the business which manufactured the radio was able to tweak his design 
and take control of the product.

Now Mr Baylis, who was awarded the OBE in 1997, wants the Government to introduce stronger legal protection for inventors.

Under current laws, patent infringement is a civil rather than a criminal offence.

The pensioner, who lives alone on Eel 
Pie Island in Twickenham, South-West London, said: ‘I’ve got someone 
coming around in the next couple of weeks to do a valuation on my house.

‘I’m going to have to sell it or remortgage it – I’m totally broke. I’m living in poverty here.’

The inventor lives in a one-bedroom home overlooking the Thames with his pet labrador.

He built the house, which boasts its 
own mooring berth and a five-metre swimming pool in the entrance hall, 
in the 1970s for £20,000.

A keen jazz fan, he was drawn to Eel 
Pie Island because of its reputation for hosting influential jazz and 
blues artists in the 1960s.

Some 120 people live on the island.

Mr Baylis, who was recently named 
among the 50 greatest inventors in British history, said:  ‘If people 
are not going to be rewarded for their inventions, then why should they 
invent at all? This nation was built on inventions and manufacturing.

He created the radio so third world countries could learn about AIDS prevention without needing batteries

‘People such as James Dyson have done 
very well, but not many of us have all the business skills we need to 
bring a product to market. Students need to be taught about intellectual
property in schools.’

After inventing the wind-up radio, Mr 
Baylis went on to produce wind-up versions of a torch, mobile phone 
charger and MP3 player. He has invented more than 250 products, 
including a shoe that generates enough electricity as you walk to charge
a mobile phone.

He called on the Government to 
introduce tougher laws, in line with the US and Germany, which would 
allow people who steal intellectual property to be jailed.

Mr Baylis added: ‘The Government 
should offer financial support, advice on developing people’s 
inventions, and help to keep that manufacturing here in the UK.

‘It would make money for the British economy.’
