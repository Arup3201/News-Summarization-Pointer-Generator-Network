James Milner may yet remain at Manchester City, despite strong reports linking him with a move away from the club.

The England international's contract at the Etihad Stadium expires at the end of the season.

And after talks with City over a new deal continued to drag the 29-year-old looked set for pastures new.

James Milner could yet sign a new Manchester City deal despite being linked with a move away from the club

Milner arrived at the Etihad Stadium in 2010 from Aston Villa for a reported fee of £26 million

The England midfielder's contract situation has attracted interest from clubs both at home and abroad 

But Sportsmail understands both club and player have not yet given up on reaching an agreement that would see Milner extend his stay in Manchester.

Negotiations are set to re-open in the near future and much will depend upon assurances over playing time. While this season Milner has made 11 first team starts in the Premier League compared with 12 in the whole of last season, he is under no illusion that the impact of injuries and and non-availability of the likes of Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri have helped his cause.

In City's last two matches Milner has started in his preferred central midfield position and would welcome more opportunities at the same spot.

The player is known to have options at home and in Spain and Italy.

However, it is understood that signing a pre-contract deal with a foreign club is unlikely.

Regardless of how talks with City pan out, Milner is thought to be keen to stay at the Etihad for the rest of the season and to honour his previous deal.

The fact that he is an England international available for free means he is in a strong position as he looks for a new deal at the age of 29 but playing time, rather than cash on the table, is thought to be the main incentive.

It is understood that regular first-team football will be Milner's main priority when deciding his future

Meanwhile, City declined to comment on whether they have a plane on standby to bring Ivory Coast pair Toure and £25m new boy Wilfried Bony home from the Africa Cup of Nations should their side lose to Cameroon on Wednesday night and be eliminated.

The club are reluctant to discuss the prospect out of respect to the Ivory Coast.

Should a defeat transpire, though, both would no doubt be welcomed into the fold by Manuel Pellegrini ahead of Saturday evening's title race showdown with league leaders Chelsea.
