The widow of a Sky TV executive killed in a speedboat accident has spoken for the first time about trying to rebuild her life.

Victoria Milligan lost her husband Nick, 51, and daughter Emily, eight, in the tragedy during a family holiday in Cornwall.

Mrs Milligan, 42, lost a leg, and the couple’s other three children – Amber, then 12, Olivia, ten, and Kit, four – were injured in the incident near Padstow on May 5 last year. Kit had to spend ten weeks in hospital due to his injuries.

She spoke yesterday about rebuilding her life and raising thousands of pounds for good causes.

Mrs Milligan, who has a prosthetic 
limb but has returned to work as a fitness instructor, said: ‘My whole 
life was completely planned and sorted with my lovely husband and my 
four children, and the rug has been pulled from underneath me.

'I only had my little girl for eight years.

'Anniversaries, birthdays, Father’s 
Day, the anniversary of the accident, everything – you just look at a 
black hole and you don’t want to contemplate it because it is just too 
awful to think about.’

Speaking to Radio 4’s Today programme, she said: ‘People go through all sorts of horrendous things.

'Losing a parent, or looking after a sick child, whatever it is, we don’t know what life is going to throw at us.

‘And it makes you realise what true joy is, in a way, because you have hit rock bottom.’

Mrs Milligan still finds it too painful to discuss exactly what happened that terrible day.

A report by the Marine Accident 
Investigation Branch found that Mr Milligan, managing director of Sky’s 
advertising sales division, was killed after taking control of the 
steering from his wife.

Mrs Milligan was standing by the helm 
of the boat, but was not attached to its kill cord – a safety device 
designed to cut power in an emergency.

The boat then rolled violently, tossing the couple and their children into the water.

As the unmanned and out-of-control 
boat circled the family at full power, Mr Milligan and his daughter 
Emily were fatally wounded by the propellers.

Mrs Milligan said that they had received full training before the accident and that her husband was ‘hugely safety conscious’.

She's already raised £250,000 for Cornwall Air Ambulance but hopes her latest feat will amass £300,000 for the RNLI and Child Bereavement UK

‘What happened to us was a horrific 
accident,’ she added. Interviewed near the crash scene recently, she 
said: ‘Looking at that beautiful beach and the beautiful sea, and 
remembering what happened there is really, really tough.’

Appealing to other boat users, she said: ‘Please always wear a kill cord. Just be aware you are driving a powerful machine.’

Earlier this week, after months of 
low-key fundraising, Mrs Milligan presented Cornwall Air Ambulance with a
 cheque for £250,000. Their new helicopter will be named after her late 
husband and daughter.

Yesterday morning 125 of her friends 
started a bike ride from Cornwall to London to raise £500,000 for Child 
Bereavement UK and Cornish lifeboat stations. They are scheduled to 
finish tomorrow.
