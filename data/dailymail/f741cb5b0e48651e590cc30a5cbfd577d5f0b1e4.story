A cat is showing signs of improvement after undergoing urgent surgery for having an arrow shot in her eye which went through her skull.

She was brought into an Auckland vet clinic late last night with a metal arrow 'quite deeply imbedded' in her right eye, veterinarian Dr Jess Beer told 3 News.

Dr Beers believes this was an intended attack and the incident is being investigated by animal welfare.

A cat is surprisingly recovering well after having an arrow shot in her eye which went through her skull

The young female cat was taken to the Maunkau After Hours Veterinary Clinic

She was brought into an Auckland vet clinic late last night with a metal arrow 'quite deeply imbedded' in her right eye, veterinarian Dr Jess Beer said

The young female cat was rushed to the Maunkau After Hours Veterinary Clinic when her owners discovered her with a metal arrow in her eye when she came back to their Howick home, east of Auckland.

'The bolt came out with no major complications and fingers crossed, we are actually hoping that eye will be saved,' Dr Beer told 3 News.

'It was directly in her eye, someone was aiming for her head, so I can't imagine this being an accident.

'Unfortunately, there are some people who consider cats a nuisance and I would hate to think this is the outcome of those sorts of attitudes.' 

Dr Beers believes this was a deliberate attack and the incident is being investigated by animal welfare

Dr Beer says she will find a new home for the cat once she makes a recovery from surgery

Dr Beer says she will be monitoring the cat for 10 days before making a decision on whether the injured pet can undergo a second surgery to take out its wounded eye.

The attack is being investigated by Auckland SPCA, who are appealing for information into the incident. 

Chief executive Chris Kalin told 3 News there has been two other similar cases in the area in recent years.

The clinic had to perform the surgery for free as the cat's owners could not afford to pay the medical bills. 

Dr Beer says she will find a new home for the cat once she makes a recovery from surgery.
