A South Dakota teen may have become the youngest person to fly solo around the world.

Nineteen-year-old Matt Guthmiller completed the more than 29,000-mile
 journey in a single-engine airplane Monday night when he touched down 
at Gillespie Field in El Cajon, California.

Guthmiller's flight began May 31.

Going places! Matt Guthmiller, the youngest pilot to fly solo around the world, arrives at Gillespie Field in El Cajon, Calif. on Monday

Record-breaker: The young pilot's progress was tracked in real time at Limitless Horizons

Success: The 19-year-old student from South Dakota, left May 31 from Gillespie Field to circumnavigate the globe in a leased 1981 prop-powered, single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza A36

His final, 16-hour leg took him from Honolulu, Hawaii, over the Pacific Ocean to El Cajon.

The Aberdeen, South Dakota, native was greeted by reporters and his mother in El Cajon as he said: 'It's great to be back.'

Shirley Guthmiller was at the front of the crowd having flown in from Aberdeen earlier that day.

As the family had an exclusivity contract with 'The Today Show,' she told U-T San Diego she would not be able to comment at length to any other media.

'It was a lot of fun,' Matt said before being whisked into a private area in the High Performance Aircraft's main building.

Proud: Guthmiller said little to reporters besides that 'it was fun' before being whisked back to a private staging area at the airport

Father Allen Guthmiller told reporters that he was extremely proud of his boy but not at all surprised

'This
 was a kid that was afraid to go into the basement,' he 
said.

'He's not afraid of the dark now. He flew a lot of miles at night.
 He had everything planned out since day one. Matt has that engineer's 
mentality that all the kids at MIT have. He's always been a step ahead. 
And when he says he's going to do something, he's going to find a way to
 do it.'

The previous record was set by Australian Ryan Campbell who was 19 
years, seven months and 25 days old when he completed the 
circumnavigation last year.

Guthmiller will be that age on July 24.

Guinness World Records didn't immediately respond to a message early Tuesday.

The freshman from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, South Dakota, began his 29,000 mile journey in California.

'Can't say flying alone over the Australian outback is quite how I usually spend the Fourth of July,' he wrote on his Facebook page as he hit the halfway mark in his 1981 Beechcraft A36 Bonanza.

Matt made 25 stops in 14 different countries across five continents during his journey, including London in the UK, Rome in Italy, Athens in Greece, Cairo in Egypt and Bangkok in Thailand.

'Nothing is impossible,' he wrote on the website during the journey.

'And Iâ€™ve never been the kind of person to just hang around and wait for great things to happen. If you really want to achieve something great you have to go out and get it.'

Homesick: Matt Guthmiller said he did not expect to be spending his American fourth of July celebrations flying solo across Australia

His love of flying dates back to the days he logged hundreds of hours on flight simulator games as a child.

'My real goal is to inspire other young people to attempt things of a similar magnitude. That's what I hope to accomplish with this flight,' he said.

Matt documented his adventure through Limitless Horizons, a non-profit fundraiser.
