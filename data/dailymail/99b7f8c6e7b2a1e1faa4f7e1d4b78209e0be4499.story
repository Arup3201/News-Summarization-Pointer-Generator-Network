Xabi Alonso has introduced himself to the Bayern Munich faithful in the best possible way - by having a stellar debut at centre-back and then donning trademark Bavarian Lederhosen.

The Spanish midfielder, who signed from Real Madrid for £5million last week, made an impressive first appearance in an unusual centre-back role in Bayern's 1-1 draw away at Schalke.

He completed the most passes (66), made the most touches on the pitch and covered the largest distance as he slotted straight into Pep Guardiola's side.

And the 2010 World Cup-winner seemed determined to fit in with his new team-mates during the filming of a beer advert for Bayern's sponsors Paulaner.

The 32-year-old appeared awkward at times during the filming of the advert, looking sheepish while standing in the traditional German dress and holding a glass of beer.

Alonso appeared to struggle with part of the Lederhosen outfit, getting caught as he tried to remove the top part over his shoulder.

The summer signing was then pictured later minus the top part of his garment, as were some of his team-mates, during a photoshoot. 

Hard worker: Alonso also ran the furthest distance on the pitch against Schalke and had the most touches
