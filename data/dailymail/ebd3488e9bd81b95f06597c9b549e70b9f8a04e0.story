Louis van Gaal confirmed Radamel Falcao has no work permit or visa issues, and the Colombian striker is available for Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

As in Daley Blind who is happy to play in defence or midfield - wherever he can help the team, he says.

FALCAO, BLIND, MARCOS ROJO AND LUKE SHAW COULD ALL DEBUT VS QPR

We've had the lot. All you need to do is scroll down for a timeline of today's events as Manchester United unveiled Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind at Old Trafford.

We'll have every single photo that drops so don't go anywhere..

Louis van Gaal on whether Radamel Falcao is right for Manchester United: 'Today, he had one chance and it was in the goal. He confirmed it in his first training session.'

Manchester United's press conference told us a lot, but what exactly? Were the questions answered about Falcao's fitness, Van Gaal's favoured XI and Blind's position?

1) FALCAO SAYS FITNESS IS NOT AN ISSUE: Radamel Falcao, speaking in good English, explained how his fitness has not been an issue and that he's excited to get going. A Queens Park Rangers debut beckons. Robin van Persie is also 'fitter than ever'.

2) BLIND IS HAPPY AS A DEFENDER OR MIDFIELDER: Daley Blind is happy to be a defender or midfielder, and the versatile player will do whatever's he's told by Louis van Gaal.

3) VAN GAAL WON'T LOSE SLEEP OVER PICKING HIS XI: Van Gaal says he won't have a problem picking a starting XIbecause Manchester United let a sufficient number of squad members leave during the summer, too.

4) VAN GAAL IS PREPARED TO GIVE YOUTH PLAYERS A CHANCE: Van Gaal is prepared to give youth players a chance and says it is a proud legacy of Manchester United which he feels he must protect.

5) FALCAO SAYS CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUALIFICATION IS HIS MAIN AIM: Falcao is not fretting about missing out on the Champions League. The striker's key aim this season is Champions League qualification and he insists it's well within reach.

'I hope so because they have to perform our philosophy. That philosophy is not so easy to perform.

'We've seen it already, but I think the players we have selected take that on better. Otherwise, we don't have to buy these players, I don't think.'

'I feel very, very good in myself. I'm very happy to be here. I've had a great welcome. When you're talking of a settling in period, real quality and real top footballers makes it easier. It's something I'm looking forward to getting started.

'I think I will not need too much time because Manchester United has very good players and that reason makes it easier to play football. I'm used to life in cities like this. I think I don't have a problem for adaptation.

'Every player wants to play Champions League. This year is not possible in Manchester, but we are confident to achieve the qualify for next season for next Champions League.'

'How to fit in these players is not so difficult, I think, when you let go 14 players. Six players coming in. We need also the youth education. That's the policy of Manchester United also, and when you don't let go of players to another club, then you are never allowed to give a youth player a chance. Because of this policy, we give youth players a chance.

'But the question is, if they take the chance, it's of course more risky but I think it's the only way to do it in Man United. Man United has always grown up players in the squad. That's the only way to do it.'

'For me it's important I can in both positions - defence and midfield.

'I want to play and if it's on the left or in defence or in midfield, it's up to the coach.

'I try to do my best wherever I play.'

'Good afternoon. I'm very happy to be here, it's a big challenge for me, for my career. I always dreamed to be in a club like Manchester United.

'I feel well. I started to play two months ago with Monaco and I've improved in the last month a lot. I scored goals, that's important to strikers. And I'm confident with my physical form. I'm comfortable with my knee.

'It's a new process, new team. This year come some players, and I think Manchester United build a big team this season, and then future seasons. And I would like to be here and be part of the project.'

Daley Blind, Louis van Gaal and Radamel Falcao! Here we go!

It shouldn't be too long, folks. I'm ready, I hope you are too!

Think I was too cheeky to Anderson there? What do you think the score in Manchester United vs Queens Park Rangers will be at Old Trafford on Sunday?

The QPR fan sat next to me in the office says score draw! Will they be so lucky?

Herrera: 'You're joking? Anderson is still here?'

Di Maria: 'Quiet, Ander. He's right behind you!'

Louis van Gaal wanted to get rid of Anderson (second from the left) but failed to do so during the summer transfer window. The flop was wanted by Porto in August.
