Scam: Lisa Harrison, 34, promised customers low currency rates on US dollars and special deals

A wedding planner who stole £80,000 from couples in a bid to satisfy an 'out-of-control' online gambling addiction has been jailed.

Lisa Harrison, 34, began taking money from her clients in summer 2013 by enticing them with low currency rates on US dollars and flight upgrades.

She took money from 19 couples who had entrusted their savings to her after being promised the wedding of their dreams.

It is understood that the company she worked for, iPlan New York, specialised in weddings in New York City.

Her website iplannewyork.com, which has been taken down, said: 'iPlan New York was set up to create and style the perfect tailor made wedding for couples travelling to New York to get married!

'We are passionate about what we do and passionate about New York! We have experience in planning NYC weddings for couples from all over the world.'

But she was arrested in December last year after eventually coming clean to her victims in an email and saying she had been forced to close her business.

Police soon found she had taken £80,107 from the couples and spent a staggering £77,933 on gambling sites Paddy Power and William Hill.

The business' Facebook page has also been deleted, but outraged victims have shared their victims on a wedding forum.

One victim called Jennifer wrote in November 2013: 'I had previously given Lisa a positive review because our vow renewal went wonderful.

'Little did I know until last week that she didn't even pay the vendors that helped with our ceremony.

'I am so disgusted and can't fathom such an act. We paid her in full and to think that our photographer didn't even get paid is just astonishing to me.

'I feel so horrible for the other couples that had their perfect day planned and this woman decided to perform such an act.

'I pray for each of you in hopes that you will be able to move on from this and live a healthy and happy life with your significant other.

'I can't believe this woman took our money and did such an unthinkable act. God bless all of you and I hope this mess gets corrected quickly.'

While another anonymous victim posted a copy of the email they claim they had been sent by Harrison when she admitted the scam.

It read: 'I have to announce the closure of iPlan New York.

'For some time now I have been battling against a gambling addiction that has seen me lose all of the company money including money paid to me by you for services and dollars.

'I cannot go on another day with this situation as this illness has taken me over completely and I have to both face up to the consequences of my actions and seek help for the debilitating addiction.

'I am extremely ill with it and need to seek help as soon as possible.

'I am completely devastated that not only have I lost money of yours but betrayed your trust as a wedding planner.

'Right now I am uncertain as to what the future holds with regards to future weddings already planned, I will be in touch with the suppliers in NYC to inform them also.

Sentence: Harrison, of Earith, Cambridgeshire, was jailed for two years at Peterborough Crown Court, above

'I will today be having my computer and all electronic devices ceased (sic) under an intervention and handing myself into the police to give a statement and to tell them everything.

'No doubt you will be informing the police too and for those purposes it will be the Cambridgeshire Constabulary and my full name is Lisa Harrison and I will be handing myself in after sending these emails.

'I won’t be able to reply to any emails or calls for the time being as I will not have access.

'I am truly from the bottom of my heart so sorry for everything, as with addictions I thought I had everything under control and was in denial that I could put everything right, which I have been trying so desperately to do.

'As soon as and if I am able to communicate further about any outstanding issues I will do so. Lisa.'

Posting on an online review site for the wedding service, one former customer said: 'We are due to go in less than 48 hours and we have nothing!! She has now closed down her website too! She has left us devastated!'

Another, using the name Shaun, wrote: 'Alarm bells rang for me when she asked for all our spending money cos she had a deal on a currency card.

While one woman, using the name Andrea, said: 'I am absolutely devastated for anyone who has used iPlan New York and subsequently been let down'.

She added that she had a 'gut feeling' not to pay upfront.

Harrison, of Earith, Cambridgeshire, admitted fraudulent trading and was jailed for two years at Peterborough Crown Court on Tuesday.

Det Sgt Iain Moor, from Cambridgeshire Constabulary, said: 'This was an extremely distressing case for the 19 couples who lost life savings and had their dream day ruined by Harrison.

'I hope the victims received some comfort in the prison sentence imposed on Harrison, meaning they can now start to re-build their lives.'
