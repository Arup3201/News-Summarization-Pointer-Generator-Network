Arsenal legend Ray Parlour believes that Arsene Wenger and the club need to start spending more if they want to have any chance of competing for the Premier League title in the future.

The Gunners bought Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista for £11.2million and signed 17-year-old midfielder Krystian Bielik in a £2.4million deal from Legia Warsaw during the January transfer window.

However, Parlour believes that the club still need to invest heavily in the summer, despite the saying Arsenal squad is in good health.

Parlour wrote on Sportlobster.com: 'The squad they have now is very good, but the signings are important. The age of the squad is very good. 'This summer is going to be so important. They will get back to winning stuff. 

'They could overturn Manchester City and Chelsea if they bring in the right players. It is time to kick on from last year's FA Cup win.'

Arsenal have repeatedly been linked with a defensive midfielder, including Southampton's £24m-rated Morgan Schneiderlin. 

However, Parlour believes the unexpected rise of Francis Coquelin, who starred in the 2-0 away win against Manchester City, will make Arsene Wenger think twice before signing a midfield enforcer.

The 23-year-old Frenchman has been featuring regularly for Arsenal ever since the December win over West Ham United, but he is out of contract in the summer.

Parlour added: 'It is great to see Coquelin play well. A lot of the plaudits go to attacking players, but he's taken his chance very well. 'Wenger is loyal so, if you play well, he will keep on playing you. He's become an important player for Arsenal. 

'He probably thought it was his last chance and he's certainly done brilliantly. 'It will be interesting to see what he does in the summer.'

Arsenal are currently on a five-match winning streak, including victories over Hull City and Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup.

Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez have scored in recent games and so Parlour believes Wenger has been dealt with a selection headache in attack.

Parlour added: 'At the moment, Cazorla is playing so well that he has to play. Sanchez has to play.

'If everyone were fit, I would have Ozil on the left, Cazorla in the middle and Sanchez on the right. Olivier Giroud is my striker.

'Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would be on the bench. It is a good problem to have, though. 'Having said this, I like Theo's pace and he's something different to the others.'

The form of Alexis Sanchez, Ozil and Cazorla is likely to see Theo Walcott on the bench in upcoming games
