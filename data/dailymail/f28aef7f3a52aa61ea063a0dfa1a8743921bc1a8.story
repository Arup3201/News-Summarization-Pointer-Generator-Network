The Spain striker agreed a two-year deal with the Rossoneri over the summer but has struggled to find form at San Siro. 

He is due to receive an award in Dubai on Monday but is then expected to travel to Madrid to complete the formalities of medicals with his boyhood club Atletico.

Italy international Cerci will go in the opposite direction and is due at Milanello for medical tests on New Year's Eve.
