A judge branded Snoop Dogg a 'misogynist wretch' as he launched into a bizarre rant at the rapper while sentencing a female fan for drunkenly punching a policeman.

Simone Campbell, 18, drank eight glasses of wine and 'a quantity' of Captain Morgan spiced rum on the night of a Snoop Dogg concert at Ebrington Square, Derry, in October last year.

Campbell admitted punching a police officer on the ear, as well as resisting arrest as she tried to make her way home from the gig.

At the hearing at Derry Magistrates' Court yesterday, judge Barney McElholm took a moment to vent his views on the controversial rapper, the Belfast Telegraph reported.

Giving Campbell a 12-month probation order, the judge said: 'Despite the bad behaviour espoused by his lyrics there was no excuse for this.

'Why any woman would want to go to a concert to listen to this misogynist wretch escapes me. 

'Why he was allowed into the country in the first place is another matter.'  

Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus Jnr and is also known as Snoop Lion, was banned from the UK in 2006 after an altercation at Heathrow Airport which led to him spending a night in the cells.

He was allowed back into Britain in 2010, however some of his entourage are still said to be banned from flying with British Airways.

His visit to Derry, part of a wider tour of the UK, was slammed by women's groups who called for the concert to be cancelled.

A spokesman for Foyle Women's Aid said at the time: 'His lyrics are demeaning and they objectify women and he has a history with drugs.'

Judge McElholm has a history for odd remarks during court cases, saying in 2011 that young men are too fascinated by martial arts and 'Ninja Turtles' as he sentenced a man for putting a police officer in a headlock.

The late judge James Pickles was known for his colourful remarks

Judge McElholm is not the first judge to appear out of touch during a court hearing.

The late judge James Pickles was well-known for his colourful remarks, particularly when is he is said to have asked a barrister: 'Who are the Beatles?'

He also jailed the mother of a 10-week-old baby for six months, saying that he did not want women believing they could avoid custody by becoming pregnant.

The sentence was later reduced to a probation order.

In 2003, Judge Huw Daniel demanded a juror leave Mild Crown Court for wearing a shirt with the 'FCUK' logo.

Once the juror had been stood down, Judge Daniel explained his actions.

He told the court:  'I stood one of the jurors down. He didn't take the oath properly.

'Secondly, the mode of dress was a potential source of distraction.

'The mis-spelling of a basic Anglo Saxon word on a garment hardly dignifies the court proceedings.

'It is beyond me why anyone can think that they should wear anything like that in public, particularly in court.'
