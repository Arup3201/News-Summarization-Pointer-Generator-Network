On trial: Andy Coulson faces court after being accused of perjury during the trial of former MSP

Andy Coulson is to go on trial after he was today accused of lying under oath during the court case of a Scottish socialist outed as a swinger.

Coulson was editor of the News of the World in 2004 when the tabloid reported Tommy Sheridan had visited a sex club and cheated on his wife Gail.

Sheridan - an MSP representing the Scottish Socialist Party at the time - was awarded £200,000 in defamation damages but ended up on trial for perjury and was found guilty in 2010.

He was convicted and jailed for three years for lying under oath about visiting Cupid's swingers' club in Manchester and his sex life during his 2006 defamation case.

Coulson gave evidence that led to Sheridan's conviction and told the court that he did not know about the hacking of phones by the News of the World.

Coulson was formally charged with three counts of perjury at a hearing in Glasgow today. He did not appear in court.

It is alleged that Coulson, 46, made false claims in December 2010 while under oath as a witness at the trial of Sheridan and his wife Gail. Mrs Sheridan was cleared.

The indictment claims that he falsely said that he had not heard of convicted hacker Glenn Mulcaire and did not know that royal editor Clive Goodman made payments to him.

It also alleged that Coulson said he was not aware of a culture of phone hacking at the News of the World, apart from a 'very unfortunate case' involving Goodman.

According to the indictment, Coulson was in fact aware of a number of instances of phone hacking at the News of the World between April 1, 2002 and August 8, 2006 while he was editor and acting editor of the newspaper.

It also claims that between December 1, 
2002 and January 26, 2007, while editor and deputy editor of the 
newspaper, Coulson understood that payments had been made to corrupt 
police officers by Goodman.

NOVEMBER 2004: Sheridan sues News of the World after it publishes series of stories alleging adultery and visits to a swingers' club.

AUGUST 2006: Politician denies allegations in court and jury awards him £200,000 in damages against News Group Newspapers.

OCTOBER 2006: His testimony seems to be blown apart after News of the World publishes secretly-recorded videotape in which Sheridan admits having visited sex club.

DECEMBER 2007: Sheridan arrested as he leaves Edinburgh radio station and charged with perjury.

FEBRUARY 2008: Gail Sheridan, who acted as supporting witness to her husband, also charged with perjury.

OCTOBER 2010: Couple's perjury trial begins.

DECEMBER 17: Gail Sheridan acquitted.

DECEMBER 23: Tommy Sheridan convicted of perjury.

JANUARY 26 2011: Sheridan jailed for three years.

August 6 2014: Andy Coulson told he faces trial for perjury 

The payments included £750 in or around December 2002, £1,000 in or around January 2003 and £1,000 in or around June 2005.

These were made to procure a 'green book' or other similar directories containing information including telephone numbers relating to the Royal Family and their members of staff, the indictment states.

During Sheridan's trial, where he defended himself, he had called Andy Coulson to give evidence. This is when he is alleged to have lied under oath about hacking.

Sheridan - who previously served time as part of an anti-poll tax campaign and then over an anti-Trident protest at Faslane nuclear submarine base - maintained his innocence through the trial.

He claimed he was the victim of a 'vendetta' by the police and a 'conspiracy' involving the News of the World and colleagues within the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP).

The former SSP leader said 16 former allies were lying as part of a 'political civil war' when they told the High Court in Glasgow that he had admitted at a 2004 meeting having been to Cupid's swingers' club in Manchester. 

But the jury found him guilty of perjury during the 2006 civil defamation case and lying about having an affair with SSP member Katrine Trolle.
