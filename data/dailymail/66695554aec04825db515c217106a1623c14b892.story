A 19-year-old died in a car crash while she was looking for her boyfriend after the two had a fight in the early hours of Mother's Day, an inquest heard.

Emily Morfitt, 19, died instantly after her blue Ford Ka left the A1174 on a bend at Woodmansey, at around 4am on Mother's Day.

The car smashed into a concrete post and flipped over a 8ft-high hedge, before coming to rest in a field close to Lakeminster Park, near Beverley, East Yorkshire. 

Jack Davies and his girlfriend Emily Morfitt, who died when she crashed her car while following him after a row

An inquest into her death heard how she had been arguing with her boyfriend of around a year, Jack Davies, 21, following a night out with friends at The Sugar Mill in Hull. 

The teenager, who worked in the restaurant at Brown's department store in Beverley, suffered head, neck and abdominal injuries. 

On the night, Mr Davies had visited Napoleon's Casino, also in the city centre, with his friends. 

Giving evidence, Mr Davies told how he had arranged for a taxi to collect him and Emily from outside Bodrum's takeaway close to the nightclub his girlfriend had visited.

Emily did not know where the takeaway was, so Mr Davies walked to The Sugar Mill where he saw his girlfriend and her friend being 'chatted up' by a group of men.

He said: 'I did not like what I saw.'

Her friend took a separate taxi home, while Mr Davies and Emily took the taxi back to her home.

Mr Davies said there was a 'strained atmosphere' in the car and said his girlfriend had 'nipped' his arm on the journey home, while taxi driver Neville Huntley said Mr Davies was verbally abusive to her.

Back at the house an argument broke out between the two and Mr Davies went to sit in his car outside the house.

He claimed Emily had got into her own car and drove up the road, negotiating a roundabout, before returning home.

Mr Davies then said he drove on to The Robin pub in east Hull, before returning to Emily's home, where he parked up. She was not there, and so he sat parked and waited for her.

He woke a few hours later to a phone call from his girlfriend's father John Morfitt telling him of the accident. 

The inquest also heard from Emily's mother Joanne, who had confronted her daughter in the house as she was rushing off to 'stop' Mr Davies.

Mrs Morfitt said she and her husband John had expected trouble between the two that evening.

She said: 'They were both intently jealous of each other. We were dreading it.'

Mrs Morfitt said she was woken at 3.37am by the sound of a car engine.

'I went downstairs,' she said. 'Emily passed me in the hallway. She was in a rush. I could see that Emily had been crying. She had mascara all over her face.

Emily Morfitt had been drinking but was not over the legal limit when she got behind the wheel, police said

'I said to her, "Emily, what are you doing?"' She said: "I am going to my car".

'I told her she can't. She had been drinking. She said: "It's OK. I've not been drinking but Jack has. I need to stop him".'

'I saw no sign that she had been drinking. She kept saying, "I need to stop Jack".'

Mrs Morfitt said she opened the front door and saw her daughter and Mr Davies sitting in their respective cars.

'Emily had her lights on and the engine was running.

'I thought this was not right so I went to get a coat. My intention was to get the keys for both cars. When I went back outside they had gone. I thought about ringing Emily on her mobile phone, but realised she would be driving.'

She and her husband were visited a few hours later by police who informed them their daughter had died in a crash.

Emily had 76mg of alcohol in her blood, which 'may have affected cognitive functions', say police. The legal limit is 80mg per 100ml of blood.

Checks on the car showed insufficient tread on one tyre, but crash investigators said this would not have caused the accident.

Officers believe it was likely Emily, described as an 'inexperienced driver', was travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.

Police also noted four calls had been made from her iPhone to Mr Davies shortly before 4am, although it is not clear if she had made these while driving. He did not answer the calls.

Rosemary Baxter, deputy coroner for Hull and the East Riding, returned a verdict of accidental death.
