A preview segment for NBC's Nightly News turned into a sweet father-son encounter when anchor Lester Holt met his own son on-air.

Stefan Holt, who has followed in his father's footsteps and anchors the local news in Chicago, said 'Hi, Dad!' before handing over to the national host for a preview of that evening's stories.

Lester responded 'proud of you' before going on to walk viewers through what was coming up later that evening.

The two also traded jokes about Stefan's bedtime, as the younger Holt was already 'up late' covering the evening newscast for a colleague.

Indeed, both Holts crossed paths on the airwaves because they were filling in for somebody else - Lester Holt for the scandal-hit Brian WIlliams.

Holt, previously the Nightly News weekend anchor, stepped up to the weeknight job after Williams was yanked off the flagship newscast by NBC bosses.

It followed repeated revelations that Williams had lied about his personal involvement in stories, including being hit by an RPG over Iraq.

NBC, which said he had violated the trust of their viewers, suspended Williams for six months without pay. He is one month in to the punishment.

In his absence, Holt has managed to keep ratings steady at the Nightly News program.
