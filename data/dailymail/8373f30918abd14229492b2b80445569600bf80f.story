Caught out: Noreen Khan, 44, from Derby has been jailed for nine years

A mother-of-two has been jailed for nine years after she was caught with up to £70,000 of heroin hidden in the soles of her sandals.

Noreen Khan, 44, from Derby, was trapped after a UK Border Agency spotted the packages in two pairs of her shoes at Coventry Airport.

The officer became suspicious about the package because it did not have a customs declaration attached to it, according to prosecutor Avik Mukherjee.

Further investigations revealed that 250g of heroin was hidden in the sole of each sandal.

Each shoe had been glued back 
together and wrapped in a plastic bag, concealed by clothes.

An undercover officer for 
the Border Agency replaced the heroin with a harmless substance.

The package was delivered to the destination on the label - Khan's home address on March 25, 2011. 

Although it was addressed to a Khajar Akhtar, Khan answered the door at the home she shared with her daughters aged 17 and 22.

She claimed the parcel was for her cousin, but still signed for it.

A few minutes later, police raided Khan’s home and found the unopened package on top of a kitchen cupboard.

When Khan was arrested she told the officers: 'I’ve got to call two big men before 4pm to collect the package.'

Officers then waited outside and Mujahid Ali arrived at the house to collect the parcel.

Ali of Newport, Gwent, was then tracked down and arrested on March 31.

In mitigation at Derby Crown Court, Olajide Lahlehin said 
Khan had not been the final person for the heroin to be delivered to and she had not opened the package.

Strong words: Sitting at Derby Crown Court, Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: 'You didn't learn your lesson last time, I don't know if you will this time'

The sentencing comes just three years
after Khan was released from an eight-year jail sentence for smuggling 
2.2kg of heroin, also in a pair of sandals and hollowed-out books.

Sitting at Derby Crown Court, Judge 
Ebraham Mooncey said: 'You didn’t learn your lesson last time, I don’t 
know if you will this time.

'Your children will be even older when you come out.'

The court heard that Ali was a heroin addict and he was also jailed - he received a five year sentence.

Detective Sergeant Jonathan Smith, of Derbyshire police, said: 'The operation has significantly disrupted this particular supply network within the UK and the sentences today indicate the significance of the people involved.
