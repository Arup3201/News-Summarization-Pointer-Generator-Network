A well-known New York City fashion designer who tailored suits for stars like Robert DeNiro and was last seen leaving a swank nightclub thrown by Paris Hilton was found dead Sunday.

The body of Michele Savoia was discovered in the Hudson River after a frantic search that began when the 55-year-old failed to meet with his girlfriend on Valentine's Day.

His body was recovered not far from where he was last seen Thursday and just a few blocks uptown where he lived on a classic yacht docked on the Hudson.

RIP: Michele Savoia, a New York City designer to the stars who was reverently called The Tailor by many, was found dead in the Hudson River on Sunday

Friends of the designer were gravely concerned for Savoia despite a police search of the Hudson that initially turned up nothing, shining some light on the state he was in leading to his death--the cause of which authorities have not revealed.

'Cops this morning, they searched the Hudson River and the port and they found nothing – thank god – but that doesn’t mean undercurrents didn’t play a part,' Savoia's friend Felix Rodriquez told WCBS-TV.

'I fear the worst,' he said. 'I fear the worst.'

Famous clientele: Savoia had many famous clients including Ricky Martin, Matt Dillon and Robert DeNiro but the 55-year-old had apparently fallen on tough times

Savoia was a father and well-known figure in the New York City fashion community

On Sunday morning, a body was found in the river near 15th street. While police did not immediately identify the body, a friend confirmed to the local CBS station that it was Savoia's.

The last few years had reportedly not been kind to the man known to many as The Tailor.

A few years ago, he moved his boutique to the Lower East Side where he was brutally beaten and robbed.

Then, in 2012, he lost his boutique 'due to another greed-driven landlord,' he wrote on Facebook.

And just last month, he appeared on WCBS-TV in a report about high-end pawning in which he described how he used a classic motorcycle as collateral to pay for the yacht on which he lived on the Hudson.

Tragic: A body was found in the Hudson not far from here Savoia lived

Friends and family initially took to Facebook to aid in the search for Savoia and some, including his friend Joan Daidone, paid tribute to him there,. too.

Daidone writes:

'Farewell to a brilliant, talented and lovely man. I'll always remember his magnificent shop in the EV and seeing him out and about at The World and other clubs.

'He worked so hard for so many years at his art. It's so sad for him to leave the world so tragically. RIP Michele. Prayers to family and friends.'

Savoia owned a Lower East Side boutique where he sold his House of Savoia collections. In the days leading to his disappearance, he was seen at several New York Fashion Week events
