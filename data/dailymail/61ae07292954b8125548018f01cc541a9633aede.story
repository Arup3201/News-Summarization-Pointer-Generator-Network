Eating cats and dogs   is largely heavily frowned upon, and in most cases illegal, across Europe.

But archaeologists have found that our ancestors likely ate these small carnivores during famines or food shortages.

The finding of bones with human teeth marks dating back 3,100 to 7,200 years ago suggests the diet of Europeans once included these animals.

The discovery was made at the El Mirador cave (shown) in Atapuerca, Spain. Archaeologists found bones with human teeth marks in them. The animals in the 'diet' included dogs, wild cats, foxes and badgers. Lead researcher Dr Patricia Martin said they may have been eaten during times of famine and food shortage

The discovery was made at the El Mirador cave in Atapuerca, Spain by archaeologists from the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution (IPHES).

In July 2014 an expert claimed that eating dogs shouldn’t necessarily be discouraged, and in fact adding the domesticated pets to our menus could be beneficial.

In an opinion piece for CNN John Sutter said eating dogs is the equivalent of eating pigs, another intelligent creature. 

He cited figures from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) that said 1.2 million dogs are euthanised every year in the US.

And he suggested eating them could be helpful in disposing of euthanised dogs.

The remains of certain animals recovered from Neolithic and Bronze Age times suggest they were eaten by humans.

In total 24 fossils were found indicating dogs and other animals were eaten. 

El Mirador was used to shelter flocks such as cattle, which were often eaten by the cave dwellers.

But it appears small carnivores were also eaten, based on cut marks, bone breakage and signs of culinary processing found in the page.

‘In El Mirador Cave, the dogs were disarticulated, defleshed and boiled,’ said Dr Patricia Martin of IPHES, who led the findings.

She said it was a possibility that humans only resorted to such meals during times of famine and food shortage.

However, she added that in some cultures such as in Asia, ‘it is considered dog meat as a rich source of protein and/or as a delicatessen meat.’

Therefore, she said: ‘It cannot be excluded that in some cases the objective was to obtain the skin of these animals.’

It’s also possible that some of the other animals, like wild cats and badgers, were boiled and consumed by accident given the difficulty of hunting wild carnivores.

‘However, neither it's possible to reject the option of being used as an extra source of food in times of shortage,’ said Dr Martin.
