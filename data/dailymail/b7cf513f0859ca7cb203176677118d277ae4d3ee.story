Eugenie Bouchard will become the new queen of Wimbledon if she wins Saturday’s final - and she is primed to surpass Maria Sharapova as the richest female athlete in the world.

The 20-year-old has just over £1million in career earnings and will take home at least £880,000 from her run to the final, which she reached by beating Simona Halep 7-6, 6-2 on Thursday.

But her on-court earnings are set to be dwarfed by endorsements. ‘When Sharapova is ready to give up her crown, Bouchard will be ready to take it,’ said Rupert Pratt of sports marketing agency Generate.

‘There is no doubt she can earn tens of millions per year. Sharapova is at the top of her game commercially.

'There was a lot of hype around Anna Kournikova when she arrived and that never got backed up. You need success on the court as well for longevity.

‘As long as Bouchard keeps doing well she will keep growing in marketability. She is Canadian and if she can open up the North America market that is highly lucrative.’

Bouchard said: ‘When you have more success, you have more requests off court. But during a tournament I don’t really pay attention to any of that stuff.’
