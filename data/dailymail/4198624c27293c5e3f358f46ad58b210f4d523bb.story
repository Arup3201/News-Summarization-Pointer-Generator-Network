Police were called to a salon to settle a dispute over hair dye after an enraged woman refused to pay for her treatment.

Suzanne Zahran rushed to Alan Rene salon in Blackburn, Lancashire, on Wednesday after a home dye kit went wrong.

Two stylists spent several hours trying to fix the henna - which had apparently burned her hair, leaving it red, brown and blonde - and agreed to finish the job with a second appointment the next day.

Strong arm of the law: Five police officers were called to Alan Rene salon in Blackburn, Lancashire, to settle the dispute after Suzanne Zahran refused to settle her £107 bill for her hair dye

But when they presented her with a bill for £107 at the end, she refused to pay, claiming she preferred it before.

Eventually, as the dispute escalated, the salon called 999 - and five officers - including three PCSOs - arrived at the scene.

The team negotiated with the pair for 15 minutes before telling them it was a civil matter to be settled in court.

New do: Ms Zahran leaves the Alan Rene salon after refusing to pay - two stylists spent hours over two days working on her hair colour

Hairdresser Hafiza O’Connor said: 'It’s actually cost us money to do her hair. It was a disaster because of some henna she had used.

'She had brown roots, very dark red in the middle and blonde ends. We explained that fixing it was a big job, at least £100 and we couldn’t guarantee the result.

'We got it looking really good, but she 
just refused to pay. Throughout the entire process she had been trying 
to haggle with us. A cut and blow dry alone is £35 and a bottle of 
prelightner is £10. One colour foil is £35 and she had needed two.'

Mrs Zahran, a medical technologist at Blackburn Hospital, tried to leave the salon on Wednesday night without paying for the first half of her dye, the salon said.

The next day, she did not show for the next three-hour appointment then later called saying her hair was falling out.

Eventually she came in to have it fixed - but declared she would not pay.

Ms O'Connor said: 'The first appointment needed two of us and we spent four hours on it. We were open late but she needed to go and she wanted to leave without paying.

'However we asked her to pay £54 for the first stage.

'The next day she didn’t show for an appointment we had set aside three hours for. Then she called us up saying her hair was falling out.

'Of course I was panicked and I opened up the shop for her on my day off. But there was nothing wrong with it. Hair wasn’t even coming off onto the brush.'

Mrs Zahran’s husband Fayez Zahran, also a medical technologist, said: 'She was very upset and her hair had been falling out.

What's all this then: Two police officers and three PCSOs negotiated with the pair for 15 minutes before telling them it was a civil matter to be settled in court

'There
 had been nothing wrong with the henna dye, she had just fancied a 
change of colour. She had showed the hairdresser the picture she wanted 
and the result was nothing like it. Her roots were too light.

'Throughout,
 the hairdresser was incredibly rude, saying my wife shouldn’t have had 
her done in Jordan and that the henna used had caused problems. My 
wife’s really upset and will be going elsewhere.'

Lancashire Constabulary declined to comment.
