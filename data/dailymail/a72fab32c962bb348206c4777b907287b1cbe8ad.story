Roy Hodgson has confirmed he will pick Harry Kane for his next England squad, but that Wayne Rooney remains his favoured striker in the international set-up.

Kane has burst on the scene this season, scoring 23 times for Tottenham in all competitions, and Hodgson revealed last Thursday he was willing to bring the England Under 21 striker into the senior set-up.

By contrast Wayne Rooney has been frozen out of his favoured attacking position for Manchester United for much of the campaign, and in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Preston on Monday he scored his first goal since Boxing Day.

But Hodgson, who was speaking on the BBC as a pundit for the FA Cup fifth round tie at Deepdale, admitted that he admires the quality of strikers he now has at his disposal compared to when he took over from Fabio Capello in 2012.

Hodgson said: 'We think back two or three years when I started but up front we didn’t have enormous depth.

'We saw quite a few youngsters but not that many. Charlie Austin? He's done very well. You have to wait until the 19th to see if I pick him, as well as Berahino. I really do admire them all.

Kane is already a big player at Under 21 level for England and his form has caught the eye of Hodgson

'Harry Kane? He is an all-round centre forward, can play right up there against a centre back, or come off and see a pass.

'He's got technique, he’s always looking to get on the end of crosses, that header against Arsenal was a really classy header. I thought that was a wonderful.

'If all goes well and he stays fit I’m pretty sure he’ll be in the next squad.

But despite playing midfield for much of the campaign, Hodgson has stated Rooney is still his first choice England striker. Above Rooney celebrates scoring in a friendly against Scotland in November

Even though Hodgson admitted his pleasure at seeing strikers showing form to earn a call-up, the England boss added that Rooney was still key to the Three Lions playing as a striker.

'At the moment I'd like to see him [Rooney] as a key figure for us as a centre forward, it would take a lot before I’d start to think along those lines [Rooney as a midfielder].

'He’s our captain and nearly the record goalscorer. It would take a lot from a 19 or 20-year-old to replace a man up front with over 100 caps, there’d be a lot of pressure.'
