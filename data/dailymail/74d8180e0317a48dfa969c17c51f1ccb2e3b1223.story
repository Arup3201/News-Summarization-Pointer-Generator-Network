Jordan Henderson insists Liverpool will go into their clash with Chelsea full of confidence.

The England midfielder cited the need for Liverpool to be brave as they seek a positive result at Anfield.

The 24-year-old acknowledged that Chelsea are in fine form, but the task of beating them is not insurmountable if they work as a team.

'We know it will be a difficult game because Chelsea are a top side, but I think we can still go into it with plenty of confidence.'

'It will be a big game for both teams and one that we're really looking forward to. It's a big opportunity for us to go out there and show how good we can be, especially against top opposition.

Henderson knows that Rodgers' side need to play to their maximum on Sunday. Chelsea beat Liverpool 2-0 at Anfield last season which ended an 11 game winning streak for the Reds.

'You've got to make sure every single person is working as hard as possible, collectively as a team, and that we're defending very well. Also, creating opportunities in the final third, being brave to take someone on or get a shot off. If we do those things, we can get a good result.

'The crowd always play their part, it doesn't matter what game it is - they are always up for it and always cheering us on. With Chelsea coming to town, they'll be buzzing for the game and another big game for everyone. I'm sure the crowd can help us in that sense.'
