He said: 'You want to run up and hit it as flat as you can, with a bit of top spin to get it up and over the wall. Hopefully the air moves the ball and it deceives the keeper a bit.

'You need to hit it with the thickest part of your foot - on your laces - but not too hard. Let the ball move with the wind instead of it going too quickly.'

Bale has scored nine goals in 22 games for Madrid so far this season and will be looking to add to his tally in the Champions League clash against Ludogorets on Tuesday.
