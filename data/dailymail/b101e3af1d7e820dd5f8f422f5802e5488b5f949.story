Seven baggage handlers are charged with swiping electronics, jewelry and other goods from checked luggage at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, authorities said Wednesday.

The total value of the stolen goods is over $20,000, authorities said.

The thefts occurred between March 2012 and June of this year, Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown and Port Authority Chief Security Officer Joseph P. Dunne said in a release.

28-year-old Khaleed Maynard was named as one of the defendants -- along with Sheldon Theodore, 22; Ryan Phillips, 35; Levi Miller, 47; Romero Hendricks, 30; Tihafade Esdaile, 29; and Keston Austin, 31.

Maynard, Theodore and Phillips were Swissport employees while Miller, Romero and Esdaile were Aircraft Services International Group employees. Austin was a GSI employee in Terminal 7. The others worked in Terminal 4.

Five of the defendants allegedly reached out to an undercover police officer posing as a 'fence' and the other items ended up at a pawn shop.

The passengers the defendants allegedly stole from were traveling to or from Japan, Johannesburg, London, Bangkok, Dubai and Milan and U.S. cities.

'The defendants have been caught red handed and will now face the consequences of their alleged illegal acts,' Brown said. 

iPads, iPhones, MacBooks, Samsung Galaxy tablets and phones, Toshiba laptops, Asus laptops, and a set of earrings were stolen, along with other electronics, he also said.

Brown, citing criminal complaints, stated in the release that the handlers chose the costs for the stolen merchandise, as well as rendezvous points both on and around the airport grounds and pledged to filch more goods. 

Theodore, Phillips, Miller, Hendricks and Esdaile may spend as many as 4 years behind bars if they are convicted. Maynard and Austin could spend as many as 7 years behind bars.

The defendants face charges of grand larceny and criminal possession, and were waiting to be arraigned, the release stated. 

'The Port Authority Police will continue to aggressively investigate complaints of baggage theft and arrest those, whether Port Authority employees or outside contractors, who violate the trust given them in handling property of the traveling public,' Dunne said. 

'We applaud the efforts of our law enforcement partners in the office of the Queens District Attorney for their dedication in bringing these violators to justice.'
