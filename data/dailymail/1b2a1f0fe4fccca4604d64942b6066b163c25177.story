David Cameron is facing an angry backlash from Tory MPs for failing to prevent Nick Clegg wrecking plans to cut the cost of childcare.

The Deputy Prime Minister yesterday revelled in his success in blocking proposals drawn up by the Department for Education to give nurseries the option of increasing the number of toddlers they care for, as long as better qualified staff were taken on.

Its analysis suggested the reforms could save parents an average £1,329 a year per child.

'They thought this was a bad idea': Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, told listeners to his weekly radio call-in show that his consultations had shown that parents and nursery staff were opposed to the proposals

But Mr Clegg told his weekly radio phone-in yesterday that the department’s analysis was wrong and that the reform could even push up costs - and also denied Tory claims that he had previously signed off the plans.

Tory sources said childcare minister Elizabeth Truss - who drew up the blueprint for reform as a backbench MP -- had been told when she was appointed by the Prime Minister to go ahead and implement them in full.

One senior MP said that since the reforms did not require legislation, Mr Cameron should have insisted on them going ahead anyway and was ‘spineless’ for not doing so.

Another source said: ‘When the coalition started we thought the Lib Dems would have influence over policy in proportion to the number of MPs they have in the Commons. Instead it seems the balance of power at the top of the Government is something like 49 per cent Tory and 51 per cent Liberal.’

The row over childcare has plunged 
coalition relations to a new low, with Tories in Downing Street accusing
Lib Dems of deciding to torpedo the plans before discussions had even 
been concluded in ‘revenge’ for aggressive Tory moves this week on union
funding and wind farms.

Foiled: Childcare minister Elizabeth Truss, right, had been told when she was appointed to go ahead and implement the changes in full, Tories said

But Mr Clegg told LBC radio: ‘What we said was we would consult people on this idea and then we would react to how people responded.

‘What I said very explicitly within Government is that you can only decide on this when we’ve heard the responses from people who frankly know better than any politician what it’s like to look after four, five, six two-year-old toddlers.

'The response, not just from nurseries, but overwhelmingly from parent groups was they thought this was a bad idea. They thought it was a bad idea for a number of reasons but the one I focused on was the claim initially made that it would somehow reduce the weekly childcare bill for families. I, like everyone desperately want to do whatever I can to bring childcare costs down.

‘What came back was a really clear answer that there was no real evidence that this would reduce childcare costs. In fact at one nursery after another that I visited, they said, "To be honest Mr Clegg", they would say to me privately, "It might well drive costs up because we’re going to have to spend more money on more higher-qualified staff".'

From September, the ratio for under-ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four. Each adult would be able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four. But the ratio for three-year-olds was to stay at eight or 13 children per adult, depending on whether a qualified graduate was present.

Earlier this week Mr Clegg met the Prime Minister to inform him that he was opposed to the plans and would be blocking them. However, he did not tell him when he would be making any announcement.

Other reforms to childcare, including a generous tax break for working couples to be introduced in 2015, are still going ahead.

Senior Tory minister Michael Fallon 
betrayed the growing frustration in his party at being in a coalition 
Government, saying ‘life would be a lot easier’ if the Conservatives 
were not sharing power with the Lib Dems.

Mr
Fallon, the Business and Energy Minister, said being in coalition meant
getting agreement across Whitehall was harder and the process of 
government could be ‘tedious’.

But
the minister, the senior Tory in two departments led by Lib Dems, did 
praise the junior coalition partner for sticking to the coalition’s 
commitment to getting the deficit down.

Relaxation: Under the proposals one childminder would have been able to look after four babies under the age of one instead of three, and one adult would also have been able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four

In an interview with political magazine The House, Mr Fallon said: ‘Life would be a lot easier if we didn’t have the coalition.

‘The process of coalition for both sides is time consuming, bits of it can be tedious, there are an awful lot of people to be consulted, getting agreement across Whitehall is made doubly difficult by the coalition.

‘But then if we didn’t have the coalition we would be stuck with the rest of Europe, way behind on our fiscal plan. The great strength of the coalition is that it is a five-year programme which we have struck to, of getting the deficit down.

‘Fair play to the Liberal Democrats, they have never wavered in that central purpose.’
