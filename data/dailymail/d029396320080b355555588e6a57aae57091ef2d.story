Before they carried pistols and knives, the Krays were kept entertained through less sinister means.

Dominoes, a train set and an accordion are among some of the old-fashioned children's toys which once belonged to the notorious gangster brothers, set to go under the hammer later this week.

The unusual collection, which even also a set of Royal Doulton bunnykin figurines, is expected to attract keen interest from Krays enthusiasts at the Greenwich Auctions Partnership in London.

Toys: Among the collection of items belonging to the Kray twins going up for auction this weekend is a model train set

Musical: This Spanish-style guitar and an electric guitar are also on offer to Kray memorabilia hunters

Auction: This dominoes set, owned by Ronnie Kray, still has its Wandsworth Prison release ticket

Feared: Reggie and Ronnie Kray in 1965. The twins were kings of the East End criminal underworld during the 1960s

The items, which range from the luxurious to the strange, are expected to attract keen interest.

The collection displays the twins' interests outside of their criminal activities, and may come as a surprise to some. China figurines, antique furniture, a medal, artwork and even toys are part of the sale.

The historical value of the items is huge, although the list prices for the auction are within reach for many buyers.

Reggie Kray's acoustic Spanish-style guitar with its original prison release label is estimated to fetch between £40 and £50, while his badminton racket, which also has its prison release label, is listed at £20 to £30.

A backgammon set which also belonged to Reggie Kray is in the auction priced at between £30 to £40, while Ronnie Kray's Bible is expected to go for between £25 and £30.

Strange: These Royal Doulton rabbit figurines are also among the collection going under the hammer

Religion: A Bible belonging to Ronnie Kray and an ornate clock are to go under the hammer

Coffee: A china coffee set is also among the items on offer for those wanting to get their hands on a piece of Kray memorabilia

Collectable: This strange china figurine of a boy in a car with a dog will be seen by some as a piece of East End history

Games: This chess set is one of several board games and toys among the eclectic mix of items

Other items owned by the Kray twins on sale at the auction include an Edwardian leather ladies' purse, estimated at £10 to £15, a mahogany double wardrobe for £350 to £400 and a leather-bound brass naval telescope for £20-£30.

An electric guitar, 14-piece coffee set, draughts 
set, racing bike, gent's watch, fur coats, Dinky toy cars, Reggie Kray's 
badminton trophies from prison and various pieces of furniture are also on offer.

A spokesman for the auction house said today the
items were 'from a private collection,' owned and used by 
Ronnie Kray'.

The Krays achieved notoriety in the 1960s due to their ownership of West End nightclubs and criminal activities.

They mixed with many actors and musicians of the day, including Diana Dors, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland.

The darker side of the Krays' life was their involvement, through their gang, in armed robberies, arson and protection rackets and murder

Sale: These toy model race cars are still in their boxes in perfect condition. The collection contains a number of toy vehicles

Art: Various paintings and other artwork are among the collection, including pieces painted by the Krays themselves

Attraction: This medal and brooch are expected to catch the eye of those attending the auction

Good condition: Another part of the train set , still in its box with the tracks, engines and the control box

Antique: The items include some impressive pieces of antique furniture, including this Victorian-style seat

Kitchenware: Cooking pots and a frying pan are among the less expected items up for grabs in the sale

The darker side of the Krays' life was
their involvement, through their gang, in armed robberies, arson and 
protection rackets and murder.

They were arrested on May 9, 1968 and 
convicted in 1969. Ronnie Kray remained in Broadmoor Hospital until his 
death in 1995, while Reggie was released from prison just before his 
death from cancer in 2000.

Reggie's death attracted hundreds of mourners from throughout the East End, including current members of the criminal underworld.

Ornate: This decorative mirror should catch a few eyes among buyers. At their peak the twins built up significant wealth from their criminal activities

Eye catching: A pack of playing cards still in their ornate packaging is in the sale. All of the items have their own historical importance

Music: Among the musical instruments belonging to the Krays in the collection was this old accordion

Exercise: This racing bike, belonging to one of the notorious gangsters is also for sale

Aged: Another item of interest to collectors is likely to be this radio belonging to the Krays. It has signs of wear and tear, but that will not put off buyers
