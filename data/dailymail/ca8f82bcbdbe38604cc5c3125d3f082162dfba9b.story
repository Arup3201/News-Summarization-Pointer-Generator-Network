Threats have been made to kill NYPD officers ahead of New Year's Eve celebrations tonight, according to reports.

Several threats have been made relating to the start of the new year, DNAInfo reported. There are currently 23 open investigations over threats, a source told the website.

The NYPD reported that there have been 70 investigated cases and 16 arrests.  A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Online on Wednesday that the force will remain vigilant and investigate the origins of all threats as well as adjust security measures accordingly.

According to DNAInfo and The New York Post, gang members had posted sinister messages on social media including 'Bullets give them wings' and 'Keep Calm And Bury A Cop.'

Ominous hashtags have also spread online, such as #@deadcopseveryday, #onlydeadcops, #wingsonpigs.

Thousands of  officers prepared for protests in Times Square against excessive police force as an enormous crowd of revelers gathered there under unusually tight security for the nation's biggest New Year's Eve celebrations. 

In the hours before the giant crystal ball drops at midnight, bomb-sniffing dogs and counter-terrorism units joined uniformed officers posted on the streets around the famed Manhattan crossroads. Other officers were stationed on rooftops and at area subway stations. 

Police told DNAInfo it will safeguard party-goers along with those who wanted to demonstrate. 

Police Chief Jim O'Neill said at a press conference on Tuesday: 'Times Square is probably the safest place in New York City on New Years's Eve.'

And NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton added his vote of confidence on Wednesday. 

Bratton tweeted: 'Stopped by the @NYPD114Pct to thank the members for their hard work & wish them a safe New Year's Eve tour.' 

All threats made against law enforcement were being taken extremely seriously by investigators following the brutal slayings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on December 20.

Killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley walked up to the two officers in their car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn and shot them at point-blank range before turning the gun on himself. 

Prior to the killings, Brinsley had posted threatening messages on social media including a vow to 'put wings on pigs'.

The NYPD have acted quickly following recent threats including the arrest of Elvin Payamps of Queens after he was overheard talking on his cell phone about wanting to murder two white officers.

Payamps allegedly told a friend that he wished the two cops assassinated in Brooklyn had been white and vowed to 'make it right' by shooting more officers. Unbeknown to Payamps, 38, his threats were overheard ex-NYPD officer Charles Otero who was standing nearby,  the New York Post reported. 

Otero called 911, and Payamps was later stopped by the police. He was found to have marijuana on his person and taken into custody. 

At Payamps' house, officers found a Jimenez Arms 9mm pistol and a Mossberg Maverick 12-gauge shotgun with defaced serial numbers, as well as two bulletproof vests and brass knuckles.

Payamps allegedly confessed to stealing one of the vests from the Brooklyn Detention Center and to making the threat against officers.

He was ordered held in lieu of $500,000 bail on felony weapons charges, along with charges of felony aggravated harassment, unlawful use of a police uniform and pot possession.
