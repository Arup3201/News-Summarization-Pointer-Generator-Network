A five-year-old girl was treated to a royal surprise when she received an extra special letter through the post.

After writing to her idol the Duchess of Cambridge, Scarlett Gillis was delighted when she received a letter back from Kate Middleton herself.

Scarlett, from Didsbury, Manchester was chosen for the role of Kate Middleton in a school play where she dressed up to re-enact royal occasions alongside her leading man, Joshua Rogers, five, who played Prince William.

Scarlett Gillis wrote the Duchess of Cambridge a letter after having played her in a school play and was delighted when she received a personal reply from Kate herself 

Scarlett, a pupil at St Bede's College prep school in Whalley Range, enjoyed playing the royal so much she decided to write the duchess a letter.

Scarlett told her about appearing in the school's play, A Tale Of Two Birthdays, and how she loved wearing dresses just like Kate's. 

She also attached a picture of herself to the letter, so Kate could see just what Scarlett looked like. 

And the polite little girl, who addressed the letter to 'Your Royal Highness' was even thinking about the future of the monarchy.

The budding royalist wrote: 'My name is Scarlett and I am 5 years old. My school is called St Bedes. In my nativity I played you. I got a new red dress just like yours. I hope you like the picture of me.' 

She finished her letter by writing: 'I can't wait for you to be queen. I think you are lovely, yours sincerely, Scarlett xxxx.'

In her letter Scarlett told the Duchess about playing her in the nativity and attached a photograph of herself

In return Scarlett received a letter from Claudia Spens (the head of general correspondence for the Office of TRH) on behalf of the Duchess of Cambridge which included a photograph of Kate 

Scarlett had never expected a reply from the duchess, and her family were astounded when a letter, sealed with a red royal crest, dropped through their letterbox.

The letter was written on behalf of the Duchess by Claudia Spens (the head of general correspondence for the Office of TRH).

In the letter Claudia expresses how touched Kate was to receive Scarlett's letter. 

'It was most kind of you to enclose the photographs of yourself wearing your wonderful red dress for her to see.

'She was interested to learn that you played the part of her in your school play.

'The Duchess of Cambridge hopes that you had a most enjoyable time.'

The five-year-old was thrilled to hear back from kind Kate and says she thought the Duchess would be too busy to reply to her post.  

'I was amazed, I didn't really think she would have time to reply to all those letters, but I was really happy and glad when I saw the letter and photograph of her she'd attached. 

'I thought she was beautiful.'

Teachers at St Bede's College said Scarlett was a natural when it came to playing Kate on the stage. 

Head of prep Claire Hunt said: 'Scarlett played the part very well and enjoyed every minute of it.

'She even wore jewellery that had been bought from a gift shop during a visit to the Tower of London. 

'We were all very impressed with Scarlett's letter. It was beautifully written and we're delighted she got such a lovely response.'
