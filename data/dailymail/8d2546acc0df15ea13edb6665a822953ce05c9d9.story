DJ Gardner got married standing on one leg.

Struggling to stay upright, the 36-year-old managed to light a candle and slide the ring on his wife's finger - with his feet.

That's because Gardner was born with no arms.

Because Gardner has learned how to do everything with his feet, getting married armless wasn't a big deal.

'Standing on one leg, nervous you know, 
trying to do that and trying to light the candle of course the same way,
and so it was really nice. It was different,' he told KSLA. 'Physically different, maybe, but not in spirit and mind.'

He wears his ring on a chain around his neck.

'I run into obstacles where people you 
know, they have doubts in my abilities right off the bat and they don't 
even know me,' Gardner said.

'I actually cook, I clean, I'm able to wash dishes. Doing all kinds of things with my feet.

'I didn't get out of anything [growing up]. None whatsoever.'

The father manages his uncle Les Gardner's carpet cleaning business, looking after schedules, answering calls and managing staff.

Les Gardner said his nephew's disability has never held him back, including when he first learned to swim.

'I 
want you to jump in right here. It's very deep, but I want you to jump 
in here. And before I could finish, he was in the water,' Les Gardner said, recalling when he taught DJ how to swim.

'Learning
to swim, I remember them playing catch with me in the pool. I was like,
that's not really the way you teach somebody to swim, but ok!

'He blesses so many people. I mean, just every day. He's a shining star.'

DJ said that, growing up, he didn't
have an excuse to get out of anything.

Preferring not to wear heavy prosthetic limbs, Gardner uses his feet for everything.

He can change diapers, cook, clean, wash and draw. He's entered art contests and won.

At the shooting range, he uses his feet to pull the 
trigger.

In paintball bouts with his cousins and friends, he uses his chin
and shoulder to shoot the paintball gun.

The inspiring man is president of a non-profit camp for children, Camp BILLY: Building Integrity Love and Leadership in Youth, and coaches a 10-year-old and 12-year-old football league.

'Anyone who's going through an obstacle right now, don't let that obstacle stop you. There's always a way around it, through it, over it, under it, whatever you need to do to accomplish a goal that you set, it can be done,' Gardner said.
