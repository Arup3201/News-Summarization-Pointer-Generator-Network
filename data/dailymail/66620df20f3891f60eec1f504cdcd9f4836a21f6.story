The Duchess of Cambridge isn't the only European royal who raids her wardrobe for special occasions.

Queen Letizia of Spain wore an elegant grey dress by Spanish designer Felipe Varela at an an official gala dinner for the Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos and his wife, Maria Clemencia Rodriguez de Santos on Monday night.

She and husband King Felipe VI hosted the Latin American leader at the splendid Royal Palace in Madrid, with full pomp and state.

Letizia wore a blue-grey tiered dress with lace overlay adorned with thousands of tiny crystals which she last wore in September at the inauguration of King Willem Alexander of the Netherlands.

She teamed the long-sleeved, high-necked gown again and accessorised with a blue sash and fleur de lis diamond brooch, along with matching satin peep-toe platform heels and a slim grey clutch.

And topping off the look was her stunning piece from the country's crown jewels, the Spanish Floral Tiara.

The dazzling headpiece is comprised of five flower designs complete with stems and leaves and it can be converted into a necklace, while the centre flower can be worn as a brooch.

The tiara was given to the former Queen of Spain, Princess Sophia when she married Juan Carlos in 1962.

Queen Letizia last wore it at a gala dinner for the President of Chile in October and in honour of Mexico's president in June before that. 

King Felipe swapped his usual grey suit and blue tie for white tie and the jewellery and regalia of state.

The royals, who welcomed President Santos and his wife to Spain in an official ceremony on Thursday, hosted the dinner in their honour.

The Colombian First Lady looked glamorous in a floor-length blush dress with a sheer black patterned overlay with a sash tied at the waist.

Like Letizia, she wore her hair in a chic up-do.

During the dinner Felipe gave a speech to 100 invited guests which included Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, in which he assured President Santos that he can rely on 'the full support of Spain' in the 'noble proposition' of achieving peace with FARC guerillas in Colombia, reports Fox News Latino.  

Santos, who travelled to Madrid with his wife and six Cabinet ministers, said that his state visit reinforced the 'excellent' relationship between his country and Spain. 

He said: 'Spain is a nation that has always been by our side, always supporting us, always accompanying us.'

On Thursday Felipe and Letizia welcomed Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos to Madrid with an official  ceremony at El Pardo palace outside Madrid.

Letizia, 42, who looked chic in a nude skirt and blouse with black detailing, walked with the Colombian first lady Maria Clemencia Rodriguez during the event.

The mother-of-two teamed a nude blouse with a nude and black patterned pencil skirt and patent nude heels.

Her coat was an elegant tailored wool affair and she held a discreet black leather clutch.

As usual, the Spanish royal opted for small pearl drop earrings, while her hair was worn in a simple side parting.

Her South American counterpart went for a grey dress with matching pearl-studded biker-style jacket.

The women walked behind their husbands and seemed to have plenty to talk during the stately event which was then followed by an official luncheon at La Zarzuela Palace.

The foursome reviewed the troops and listened to their national anthems to kick off Santos's three-day long visit to Spain. 

No doubt Letizia, a former top newspaper and TV journalist had much to discuss with Santos, who is the former deputy director of El Tiempo, the main Colombian newspaper.

Just last week, art-lover Letizia and her husband attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital, which will feature Colombian artists this year.

The royals admired huge sculptures, including an untitled art work consisting of a  bronze swirl of metal extending out of metal dome, alongside the nation's education, culture and sports minister Ignacio Wert and the Mayor of Madrid, Ana Botella. 

At the event, which will run until 1 March, Letizia gazed at one piece made up of a vast canvas covered in red paint, nailed to the wall, which appeared to drip into a red pool on the floor where lay clustered a paint roller, pots and brushes.
