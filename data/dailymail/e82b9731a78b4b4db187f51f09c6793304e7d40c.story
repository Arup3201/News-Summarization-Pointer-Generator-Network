Controversial: Mike Hayhurst made the comments at the 17th annual Creston Classic Rodeo

A rodeo clown has landed in hot water after making a racist quip about Michelle Obama over a PA system.

Mike Hayhurst of Barstow, California, joked  at the 17th annual Creston Classic Rodeo 
about the First Lady should be a National Geographic model, according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune.

Hayhurst, whose website promises 'good clean family comedy always,' told the audience that Playboy had offered Mitt Romney's wife Ann' $250,000 to pose in the magazine.'

He then added that 'the White House is upset about it because National Geographic only offered Michelle Obama $50 to pose for them,' reported Gawker.

His remark outraged audience members and the Creston Classic Rodeo board member Mike Barrett, told the newspaper: 'We probably won’t be using his services in the future.'

There were reports that several spectators booed at his joke.

The
 San Luis Obispo Tribune reported that Mr Barrett, who spoke on behalf 
of the rodeo’s nine-member board, said they are not responsible for the 
joke but will ask Hayhurst for a letter addressing the issue and 
offering an apology.

It
 was originally reported that the racist joke about Michelle Obama was 
made by the rodeo announcer Ed Kutz, but the board later confirmed it 
was Hayhurst.

Hayhurst was unavailable for comment following the incident as he was in
 the hospital, - the reason was unconfirmed but it was possibly due to injuries he sustained during the rodeo when
 he was tossed around by a bull.

When Kansas City rang
 Hayhurst on his phone on Sunday and asked whether he wanted to 
apologize for the joke or explain his comment.

Hayhurst replied: 'I cannot 
believe how insensitive you are. I am in the hospital,' before swearing 
and hanging up.

Last 
month a Spanish magazine landed themselves in the middle of a racial 
controversy over a Photoshopped picture of First Lady Michelle Obama on 
the cover of their latest issue.

The picture places Mrs Obama's face 
in a 1800 portrait of a slave with an exposed breast, and Magazine de 
Fuera de Serie likely knew the image was going to stir up controversy.

The editors may have had a different 
message in mind given the historical context of the particular painting,
 but that sentiment was overlooked by online viewers who found the 
composite offensive and racist.

The portrait in question was 
initially released 1800, when French artist Marie-Guillemine Benoist 
exhibited the painting, titled Portrait D'Une Négresse, at the Louvre's 
annual salon.

It was viewed as a inspiring image 
because the country had abolished slavery six years prior, and the 
portrait was thought of as an uplifting symbol of both women's and black
 people's rights.
