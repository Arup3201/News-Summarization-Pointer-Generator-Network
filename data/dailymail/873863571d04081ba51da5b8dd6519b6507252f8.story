Love triangle: Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer pleaded guilty to two counts of assault and received a two-year suspended sentence

A sheriff's deputy pleaded guilty to beating his father yesterday after he allegedly caught him having sex with his wife.

Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, 33, admitted two counts of assault and received a two-year suspended sentence, 24 months probation and $800 in fines.

Brewer, of Moab, Utah, assaulted his father Wesley 'Corky' Brewer, a respected local fire chief, after he allegedly found him having sex with his wife Logan in their son's bed. 

Seventh District Judge Lyle Anderson told Brewer at Moab's 7th District Court: 'I understand why you would have been very angry on the night of your criminal conduct.

'You understand that you can't accomplish anything with violence', reported The Salt Lake Tribune.

Brewer apologized to the court, adding: 'I take full responsibility for [my actions].

'I'm not a violent person. I wasn't before and I'm not now', the local paper reported.

The assaults happened on July 11 when Brewer invited his father over for dinner.

According to police details published by TPM, Brewer cooked dinner for the trio before his wife went to put one of their children.

After she did not return, he went upstairs to check on and allegedly found her 'on top of his dad' on their son's bed. 

Brewer then fought with his father and his wife raced to her parents' house.

Wesley Brewer then returned to his own home 'to find a firearm'.

However when his 
distressed wife, Cindy Brewer, tried to hide the gun in the car, Wesley Brewer allegedly 'grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed himself two 
times, puncturing a lung and slicing his liver'.

He was rushed to Moab Regional Hospital eventually had to be flown to a Colorado hospital for surgery. 

The father and son were among several law enforcement officers in the extended Brewer 
family, which includes multiple police officers and local sheriff’s 
deputies.

TPM reported the sheriff's deputy went to the hospital to 'kill' his father, and was initially confronted by his uncle, Curt Brewer, who is also a sheriff’s
 deputy, in the parking lot.

When police arrived, intoxicated TJ was not wearing a shirt or shoes and 'stated several
 times that he wanted to kill his dad, that he wanted his gun to ‘finish
 the job'.'

Police wrote in their report: 'TJ
 made numerous remarks to each officer and deputy that arrived, about 
all of us being stupid, dumb asses, and at one point stated we needed to
 call someone with a brain to come and talk with him.'

He then assaulted a police officer, according to Salt Lake Tribune.

Brewer was arrested and charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault, two 
counts of domestic violence in front a child, assault on a police 
officer, intoxication, and disorderly conduct by Grand County officers.

Violent: Police say TJ Brewer went to Moab Regional Hospital to 'kill' his father, Wesley 'Corky' Brewer

However, because of the Brewers' law enforcement ties in Grand County, the investigation was passed onto the Utah County Sheriff’s Office who reduced the charges to two class A misdemeanors - assault and assault against a 
peace officer.

The Utah Attorney General prosecuted the case rather than the local 
district attorney.

Since his arrest, Brewer has resigned as sheriff's deputy at the Grand County Sheriff’s Department.

His father also resigned from the fire department where he had been
 chief since 1989.
