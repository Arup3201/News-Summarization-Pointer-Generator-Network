A hate-filled American church group has labelled Australian comedian Adam Hills 'corrupt' in a vile rant after he decided to donate money to the late Robin William's favourite children's hospital instead of paying for them to fly to Iraq.

Westboro Baptist church member, Benjamin Phelps, is angry that Hills did not give money to the church to fly to Iraq and picket ISIS like he originally joked during his British comedy show The Last Leg.

'You idiots can't do anything right ... the only reason you parted with any of your money was out of spite and hatred for Westboro,' Phelps said.

Hills has so far raised over $100,000 for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, after his public spat with Westboro Baptist Church last week.

He donated the money and urged his fans to do the same. 'Not only will it help a child, it will really piss of a bigot,' he said.

Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is an American unaffiliated Baptist church that believes Williams spent his life 'mocking God and promoting sin' and 'pushing flagrant debauchery, and hedonism.'

The funny man declared his feud with Westboro over in a segment of his comedy show on Channel 4 this weekend after becoming embroiled in a Twitter battle with the church when they claimed 'Robin Williams was in hell' for staring as a gay character in various films and supporting US troops.

On Wednesday, in a disturbing video published on YouTube, Phelps said: 'Recently an Australian comedian named Adam Hills threw a hissy fit regarding our comments on the demon-possessed pervert Robin Williams.'

Phelps is the eldest grandson of the church's original founder Fred Phelps and in 1995 was convicted of assault and disorderly conduct after spitting upon the face of a passerby during a picket.

Comedian Adam Hills said he is still receiving abuse from people despite donating money to a good cause

In his shocking diatribe he accused Hills of making 'a big show by donating money to St Jude Children's Research Hospital'.

After quoting the Bible, he continued: 'He made an oath in front of God and everyone that he would purchase these tickets first class so they least he could do is stop being so stingy with his money.'

Phelps claimed he still wants the first flight out to Baghdad from Kansas for his 75 church members on Friday.

'If I'm doing my math right that comes to $904,425. You can't pay your way out of hell Adam Hills, but you ought to put your money where your big mouth is or cough up the fill amount to St Jude's. Amen.'

The threat to pick Williams' funeral originally angered Hills and he fired a shot at the church on his television show, offering to fly members 'first class' to Iraq to picket extreme Islamists instead.

'If you really believe in standing up to those threatening the Christian way of life, Westboro Baptist Church, how about putting your money where your mouth is, taking a direct flight to Iraq and picketing the people threatening to behead Christians if they don’t convert?,' he said.

Then on Saturday's show he said; 'We did seriously look into this and took onboard the advice of both the US and UK governments, neither of which were too happy about us sending professional s**t stirrers into a war zone.'

Westboro Baptist Church seemed enthusiastic about the idea of going to the Middle East. They tweeted Hills saying: 'Cough up the tickets funny man, we got our bags packed. Iraq needs some preaching.'

'These guys are so desperate for attention they make Lady Gaga look like Salman Rushdie.' Hills joked.

The Australian comedian said he wants to spread 'love not hate'

The Westboro Baptist Church said Hills should provide their plane tickets to Iraq or be quiet

Instead of giving the church the publicity they wanted Hills said he is going to 'fight hate with love'.

His Crowd Rise fundraising page, set up by charity Planting Peace, says: 'Our neighbors at the Westboro Baptist Church have announced their intention to protest the funeral of Robin Williams.

'In keeping with our philosophy of addressing acts of hate and intolerance with compassion and love, we are inviting the public to show their respect and support of a man who spent his life making others smile, who was always there for others in their time of need, and who supported the greater good through works of service and charity.

In response to Hills rant, the Westboro Church claimed it had picketed in Iraq before

'Please join Planting Peace in counteracting the WBC’s message of hate through a fundraising event benefiting St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a cause Mr. Williams passionately and publicly supported.'

Hills said there was one or two things he believed would happen to church members in Iraq, if they chose to fly.

'Either you’ll die while defending your beliefs and you’ll be carried away to heaven by a gold chariot to sit at the right hand of God for all eternity.'

'OR if I’m right, and I’m willing to bet a dozen first class flights that I am, God will be standing at the pearly gates alongside a 5ft 8 hairy American comedian dressed as a middle aged Scottish nanny saying, ‘Heeeellllooooo’.

Robin Williams played an openly gay character in the film The Birdcage, one of many gay characters he portrayed.

The Westboro Baptist Church members failed to show up to Williams’ memorial service, which was held in San Francisco on Tuesday, but they did respond to Hills on Twitter, saying, 'Iraq here we come.'
