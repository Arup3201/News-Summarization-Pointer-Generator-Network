Unsuspecting people walking through a field in the Netherlands are having their heads turned by one very strange bird. 

An over-familiar owl has taken a liking to landing on the head of anyone walking through the greenery within the town on Noordeinde. 

Now photographer Menno Shaefer has paid a visit to the spot after hearing about the European eagle owl's unusual behaviour.

Unusual: Photographer Menno Scheefer travelled 68km to the northern Netherlands town of Noordeinde to photograph the own, after hearing about its strange behaviour

The 48-year-old, of Zaandam, Netherlands, says: 'I had heard a lot about the owl and decided to visit the site to see it in action for myself.

'It was a very funny thing to watch, however I'm just as confused as anyone as to why it does this.'

The wild owl, which weighs around 6lbs, spends an average of one minute perched on the head of innocent bystanders, before flying off looking for the next perch.

Clearly unhappy sitting on a fence or a tree, the owl searched for its next landing spot multiple times during Menno's short visit to the field near Noordeinde Palace.

The European eagle owl is one of the largest species of owl, and females can grow to a maximum total wingspan of 75 cm.

The bird is found in a number of habitats but mostly lives in mountain regions, coniferous forests, steppes and other relatively remote places.

'Amused': Photographer Menno said people like the photographs he takes of the owl perching on them 'vey much'

Menno said: 'When I show people these photographs they like them very much, they are as amused as I was.

'Whilst photographing the owl, it did try to land one my head once.

'However, as soon as I lifted my camera to get a shot, the owl flew onto my neighbour standing by my side.'
