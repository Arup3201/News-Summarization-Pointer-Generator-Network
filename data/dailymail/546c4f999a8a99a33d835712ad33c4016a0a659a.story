Of all the reasons to lose weight, fear of not surviving a zombie apocalypse because you are too fat has got to be one of the most unusual. 

But that is exactly what inspired an obese mother-of-one to drop nearly 7st and become fighting fit. 

Siobhan Maccow, 27, went on her brutal 'zombie apocalypse diet' as a tribute to her favourite character from television show The Walking Dead.

Siobhan was inspired to change her body by the character Michonne (pictured), played by Zimbabwean-American actress Danai Gurira in the hit AMC series The Walking Dead 

Ms Maccow, who has a six-year-old daughter, Milly, was 17st 7lb and wore size 18 clothing when she decided she wanted to emulate Michonne, played by Zimbabwean-American actress Danai Gurira in the hit AMC series. 

She began an intense exercise regime and overhauled her diet to slim down to the 11st size 12 she is today.

Ms Maccow, a care worker, said: 'Michonne inspired me. I decided that I was going to get fit enough to survive the zombie apocalypse.

'Danai Gurira plays the character brilliantly - she has such a good body, and is so strong. I wanted to be just like her.

'Whenever I'm in the gym and I work really hard at my cardio exercises. I imagine being Michonne, and that getting fit is really important for surviving zombie attacks. It keeps me motivated.

Thoughts of surviving a zombie apocalypses helped keep her motivated through her training and diet

'I put Nicki Minaj on and pretend that I'm running through a zombie wasteland.'

Ms Maccow, of Slough, first started to pile on the pounds when her daughter started school. She began to binge-eat as a means of coping with her boredom while unemployed.

By the time she reached adulthood, Ms Maccow was subject to unkind comments about her weight, sometimes even from her own daughter.

Ms Maccow said: 'I remember when Milly and I were in the changing rooms at Primark - I was trying on a new dress when I was at my fattest and my daughter said to me 'Mum, that dress is too skinny for you.'

'The whole changing room laughed at me. I was so embarrassed, that I knew I had to change.'

The mother-of-one dropped from a size 18 to a slim and toned size 12

Siobhan says her new fight fit  physique means she is confident of surviving a zombie attack 

Before losing weight Miss Maccow did not eat breakfast but ate a full English fry-up for lunch. She typically two Fray Bentos pies for her evening meal and snacked on portions of takeaway fried chicken and oven chips during the day.

From July 2012, when she began her fitness regime, she began eating Weetabix for breakfast, tuna pasta salad for lunch, and homemade soup for dinner. When she snacked, she ate cashew nuts or dried cranberries.

She also began running at the gym for at least 25 minutes every day and began weight training to tone her muscles.

Today, having slimmed down three dress sizes, she wears size 12 clothing and weighs 17st 7lb, a total weight loss of 6st 7lb.

She said: 'Getting into fitness has influenced my daughter, who is now keen to live healthily, and inspired my mum to lose some weight too.'

'I was watching the Walking Dead again recently, and every time I saw Michonne I couldn't stop grinning.

'I know I'm going to survive the zombie apocalypse.'
