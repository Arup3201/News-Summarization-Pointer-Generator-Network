A father has condemned the NHS for double standards after he was refused a surgery on his chest due to his gender, he believes. 

Gareth Edwards pleaded with the NHS for surgery after one side of his chest became bigger than the other, resembling a breast.  

The 24-year-old suffers from gynecomastia - swelling of the breast tissue in men, caused by an imbalance of the hormones oestrogen and testosterone.

Gareth Edwards, 24, suffers from gynecomastia - swelling of breast tissue in men. The condition has led to his chest becoming asymmetrical 

The father-of-one says the stress of his condition is making him ill - and he desperately wants surgery 

The condition can can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly. While it isn't a threat to health, it can cause great emotional distress to those affected. 

Mr Edwards, a father-of-one, says he is so distressed by his appearance he can no longer go to the gym or show his chest on the beach.

He is now desperate to have surgery to make his breasts more symmetrical.

However the NHS has refused to fund the op because there is no demonstrable health benefit to having it.

Mr Edwards, from Bovey Tracey, Devon, said has now been told it will cost more than £3,000 to have an operation privately - money he does not have.

Mr Edwards believes he has a right to have surgery on the NHS - but has been refused the op 

The hotel chef, who weighs 9st, said: 'About six months ago I noticed one side of my chest was bigger than the other.

'It's now got to the point where I can't go to the gym, or the beach on a sunny day and take off my T-shirt. I'm scared people are staring at me.

'My friends were shocked I had a boob and said I should seek help.

'I was told it is fatty tissue that needs removing - and it's only going to get bigger.'

He insists private surgery is not an option due to his personal circumstances. 

'I have a young son and a family to feed and clothe - I don’t have that kind of money. I need the operation to remove the lump and gristle, which is causing the problem.'

He added: 'I pay taxes and National Insurance. All I’m asking is for the NHS to do its job and fix my issue, which I shouldn't have to pay for. The stress of it all is making me ill.

'Women get boob jobs on the NHS but I can't get help - it's very upsetting.'

A spokesman for South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group said: 'When making these decisions we have a responsibility to take into account ethical issues, safety, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, balancing the needs of the majority with the differing needs of the individual.

'We are not unsympathetic to any individual who wishes to change their appearance.

'However when there is no demonstrable health benefit to the individual the NHS is unlikely to agree funding.'

The breast is made up of two main components, glandular tissue (firm and dense) and fatty tissue (soft). The ratio of glandular to fatty tissue in any breast varies from individual to individual and in gynaecomastia there may be an excess of both. If there is predominantly a diffuse fatty enlargement of the breast, liposuction is the usual treatment.

This involves sucking out the tissue through a small tube inserted via a 3-4mm incision. If excess glandular tissue is the primary cause of breast enlargement, it may need to be excised (cut out) with a scalpel. This will leave a scar, usually around the nipple edge.

This excision can be performed alone or in conjunction with liposuction. Major reductions that involve the removal of a significant amount of tissue and skin may require larger incisions that result in more obvious scars.

Most operations for gynaecomastia take about 90 minutes and are performed under general anaesthetic, or in some cases, under local anaesthesic with sedation.
