Rory McIlroy took time out from his busy golfing schedule to watch the Denver Broncos on Sunday night, and met star quarterback Peyton Manning afterwards.

McIlroy, who had been in Denver for the BMW Championship, where he missed out on the win after an embarrassing four-putt on Saturday, was a special guest at the Broncos game.

The Northern Irishman signed autographs, posed pitchside, and even had a picture with Manning in the locker room.

Denver, who lost in the superbowl last season, got this year off to a good start by beating the Indianapolis Colts 31-24.

Manning, playing against the team where he enjoyed 13 successful seasons, connected with tight end Julius Thomas for a touchdown three times in the first half. 

McIlroy will now go on to Atlanta for the next stage of the FedEx Cup, where he lies fourth in the oiverall rankings.
