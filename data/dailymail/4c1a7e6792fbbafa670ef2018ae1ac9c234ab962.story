Twitter users warn the change is another step towards the 'extinction' of the apostrophe

For 30 years it has been a sight to gladden the hearts of all who like to see punctuation used correctly.

Now, however, the bookshop chain founded by Tim Waterstone is dropping the apostrophe from its name.

Waterstone’s said it is phasing out 
the apostrophe in its logo because it is no longer ‘practical’ in the 
age of the internet and email addresses.

'Plain wrong': Angry punctuation experts say the move is grammatically incorrect

But the move sparked outrage among customers and punctuation experts who insist that the apostrophe should remain.

John Richards, chairman of the Apostrophe Protection Society said: ‘It’s just plain wrong. It’s grammatically incorrect.

‘If Sainsbury’s and McDonald’s can get it right, then why can’t Waterstone’s?

'You would really hope that a bookshop is the last place to be so slapdash with English.’

James Daunt, who became managing director last year when the chain was sold to a Russian billionaire, said: ‘Waterstones without an apostrophe is, in a digital world of URLs and email addresses, a more versatile and practical spelling.’

But the adjustment also appeared to be a slight to Tim Waterstone who founded the chain with a single store in Kensington in 1982.

Mr Daunt said the change ‘reflects an
 altogether truer picture of our business today which, while created by 
one, is now built on the continued contribution of thousands of 
individual booksellers’.

The
 former investment banker started his own chain of bookstores, Daunt 
Books, in 1990, but with only six stores it is dwarfed by Waterstone’s 
296 outlets nationwide.

Twitter users warned that the change was another step towards the ‘extinction’ of the apostrophe.

‘Seeing as Waterstone’s thinks the public is too stupid to manage apostrophes, maybe it’s time they just stopped selling books,’ one user wrote.

‘Waterstone’s is now officially called Waterstones. You sell BOOKS, idiots. As in language and proper grammar and all that stuff. Remember?!’ wrote another.

The bookseller announced the removal of the apostrophe at the same time as it revealed a U-turn on a previous rebranding.

The retailer’s logo will revert to 
its old Baskerville typeface after a trendy redesign a few years ago 
resulted in the ‘W’ being in lower case.

The latest attempt to reverse the chain’s decline in sales comes after HMV sold it to Russian businessman Alexander Mamut last year.

Mr Waterstone launched the store in 1982 with £6,000 of redundancy money from WH Smith, before selling it to his former employer for £47million 11 years later.

He tried to buy back the chain in 2006, but failed.
