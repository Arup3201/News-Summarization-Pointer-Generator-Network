A cancer survivor has been able to pay off his $50,000 medical bill after winning twice the amount on Million Dollar Minute.

Andrew Skarbek, of Hawthorn in Melbourne's east, endured a six month battle with mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma but spent his entire life-savings on medical treatment for cancer.

But on Channel Seven's quiz show yesterday, the 47-year-old wiped tears of relief as he pocketed $100,000 and is now in the running to win the million dollar jackpot.

A debt free Mr Skarbek believes he now has a second chance at life. 

'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow out on medical bills with my six month cancer treatment… Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said.

A spokeswoman for the quiz show said $75,000 is now guaranteed as a safety jackpot so Andrew has decided to play on for the next step to the magical million dollar jackpot.  

'In the week I finally beat cancer and was medically given the all clear, I was called up to go on Million Dollar Minute. I feel like this is all happening for a reason,'  Mr Skarbek said.

'My illness happened for a reason and it has made me a stronger person. 

'I haven't come into this aiming for the million, but if everything works perfectly, in a perfect world, I might have a shot to get far enough to at least put myself if in that position.

'If I win the million we will completely change our lives.' 

Mr Skarbek says he will share any surplus cash leftover from his medical expenses with his wife, Jenny, and his 78-year-old mother, Sophie.

He returned to the show on Wednesday night and missed out on the $200,000 prize but will be back tomorrow for another shot.
