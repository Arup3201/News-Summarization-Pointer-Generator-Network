British firms are forced to hire foreign staff because workers here are too lazy, Eastern Europeans claimed yesterday.

They are not prepared to stand in a factory for eight to 12 hours and find it easier to live on benefits, recruiters said.

Sandwich maker Greencore Group – which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda – is seeking staff from Eastern Europe because it cannot find locals willing to do the work.

Yesterday the Hungarian company it has hired to recruit workers suggested Britons are less likely to put up with low-paid manual labour. 

Tanay Marcell, of Euwork employment agency in Budapest, said about 100 Hungarians – many of them graduates – had already applied to make and package sandwiches for Greencore in Northampton.

Even those with a degree can earn three times what they would at home. Mr Marcell said working at the factory would involve ‘standing eight and 12 hours long’, which was ‘not an easy thing’. While Hungarians were happy to do this, many Britons would not do so because they were used to different conditions.

‘These Hungarian people will do the same badly paid jobs in Hungary. To them it is worth it because of the good salary,’ he said.

Greencore employs 1,100 staff at its current Northampton base but is looking for another 250 workers for a new £35million factory due to open in early 2016.

Yesterday’s Daily Mail story, in which the firm said it had struggled to recruit because it was ‘not always the kind of work’ locals wanted, sparked fierce debate over whether Britons are too reluctant to take low-paid jobs that are eagerly snapped up by Eastern Europeans.

Sir Michael Rake, president of the Confederation of British Industry, told the BBC: ‘That is a story I have heard many, many times from companies right across the country who are unable to find the people who are skilled enough or are willing to do the work. That is the issue – even to make sandwiches.’

He said many businesses had no choice but to recruit staff from Eastern Europe and claimed capping EU migration would leave UK firms with a ‘huge’ staff shortage because many Britons do not have ‘the same skills and willingness to work’. He added that the lack of vocational training and even basic literacy and numeracy skills in the UK brought shame on our schools and workplaces.

David Cameron vowed to ensure the welfare system ‘rewards work’ and is not so generous that it encourages Britons to choose a life on benefits over full-time work.

The Prime Minister also said Britain must ensure its young people had the necessary skills to compete with EU migrants in the workplace.

There were still too many who lacked these skills, he added.

He told the CBI conference: ‘We need to have proper immigration control. But the flipside of the coin on immigration is a welfare system that rewards work and an education system that turns out people with the skills necessary to do the jobs that we are creating in our country today.’ Mr Cameron has vowed to limit net migration to Britain from Europe and reform freedom of movement rules if he wins the next election.

Critics questioned yesterday why Greencore could not find staff in Northampton, where 8,000 are unemployed.

Hungarian employment agency EUWork, which recruits Hungarian workers for British jobs. In Hungary, the average wage is little more than £7,000. Earning the minimum wage in Britain would mean a salary of £13,520

David Mackintosh, leader of the borough council, told Channel 4 news: ‘It’s great to have the jobs in the town but actually I don’t think they can have looked hard enough if they are having to go to Eastern Europe to find them but I don’t think actually recruiting in Hungary helps to address the problem and could potentially create future problems for our town.

‘We already have an infrastructure that struggles to cope, we’re a growing town, and as people struggle to get access to our public services we need to bear that in mind before we encourage more people to come here.’

Greencore said it sponsored a Northampton jobs fair in September which yielded ‘decent’ interest and held a recent recruitment event in Corby, from which 50 staff out of 500 who had been made redundant from a local sandwich-making factory were hired.

But it still cannot find enough workers locally.

A spokesman said: ‘We have already started a range of recruitment initiatives locally and have been pleased with the response.

‘However, we will also be considering applicants from further afield, including Hungary, and will be conducting interviews with suitable candidates in due course. We are extremely proud of the diversity of our workforce and, as always, will be hiring on a strict equal opportunities basis.’

In Budapest yesterday, Rita Kovago, 32, was interviewed for a job at the Northampton factory and told she would earn the minimum wage of £6.50, plus extra for night shifts.

Miss Kovago, a sales manager for a heavy industrial goods company, said: ‘It is not a lot of money for you but it is a lot of money for us.’

In a message to British workers who might lose out, she said: ‘It’s their problem. If they don’t want to do the job, they shouldn’t be against foreign workers coming.’

In Hungary, the average wage is little more than £7,000. Earning the minimum wage in Britain would mean a salary of £13,520 – which can be topped up by generous tax credits and other benefits.

George Robert, 47, who owns a sandwich shop in central Budapest, said his sister, a university historian, worked in a factory for years after moving to Britain.

‘It took her 18 years to get a job like the one she had at a university in Hungary,’ he said.

‘It is the dirty jobs that the English people don’t want and for us the same jobs are fantastic. It is sad.’
