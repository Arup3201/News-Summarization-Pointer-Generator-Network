A supporter of Julian Assange sparked anger last night by appearing to name one of the alleged victims on BBC2's Newsnight.

Craig Murray, 53, former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, said the name twice during a debate claiming it was in general circulation, sparking a rebuke from host Gavin Essler.

Mr Murray said: 'I think incidents which are dubious themselves as to what has happened, and Julian Assange has denied the accusations against him, are being seized on as a political agenda.

'It's well worth people going online 
to discover what they can about the allegations, about how they were 
made, who made them, what the people who made them did afterwards, and 
look at what happened.

'Let us look at the conduct of these women. I'm going to say some things I know to be true.'

Mr Esser told him: 'You should not be 
naming a potential rape victim. People can look at it on the internet, 
but please do not name a rape victim on television, thank you.

'If you want to make a point, then make a point, and do it anonymously.'

The father-of-three is married to 
Nadira Alieva, whom he left his wife of 20 years for after meeting her 
at a lap dancing club in Uzbekistan in 2003.

Not rape: Galloway backed Assange against rape allegations made by two Swedish women as the Wikileaks founder spoke on the balcony of Ecuador's London embassy on Sunday

Bad manners: Respect MP George Galloway said Assange should not face a rape charge in Sweden as he was only accused of 'bad sexual etiquette' on his video podcast Good Night with George Galloway

Mr Murray's diplomatic career ended 
when he was sacked by the Foreign Office in 2004 after blowing the 
whistle on state-sponsored brutality in Uzbekistan.

Louise Mensch, ‏outgoing MP for Corby 
and East Northamptonshire, said on Twitter: 'You can tell a lot about a 
man by his supporters. #Assange has #Galloway and #CraigMurray. Nice 
#feminism.'

Another viewer added: 'Craig Murray could not be behaving more inappropriately here. Absolutely staggering.'

'Already in the sex game': Galloway said that the way Assange treated one of his accusers, who had consensual sex before allegedly raping her, 'might be really bad manners'

The circus surrounding Assange’s 
extradition had descended even further into farce yesterday as George 
Galloway waded into the row.

The Respect MP claimed Assange should not be facing a rape charge in Sweden as he was accused only of ‘bad sexual etiquette’.

In
 a lengthy diatribe on his video podcast, Good Night with George 
Galloway, the MP for Bradford West said he did not believe the two women
 who had accused Assange of rape and sexual assault.

He added: ‘Even taken at its worst, 
if the allegations made by these two women were true, 100 per cent true,
 and even if a camera in the room captured them, they don’t constitute 
rape.

‘At least 
not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it. And 
somebody has to say this.’

In their Supreme Court ruling, Britain’s most
 senior judges said the accusations made against the WikiLeaks founder 
in the European arrest warrant amounted to rape.

One of his accusers, a WikiLeaks 
supporter, admits she had consensual sex with Assange in August 2010 but
 woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again, 
without using a condom.

Mr 
Galloway said this could not be rape, as the pair had already had sex 
and were ‘already in the sex game’.

He went on: ‘It might be really bad 
manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said, “Do you mind if
 I do it again?”.

‘It might be really sordid and bad 
sexual etiquette, but whatever else it is, it is not rape or you 
bankrupt the term rape of all meaning.’

Assange
 denies all the allegations against him but claims he cannot return to 
Stockholm to defend himself at trial because of fears Sweden would 
extradite him to the U.S.

Supporters of fugitive sex suspect Julian Assange have launched cyber attacks on Government websites.

The hacking group Anonymous sent codes designed to clog up the Ministry of Justice, 10 Downing Street, the Home Office and the Department of Work and Pensions websites.

One automated programme allowed users to automatically bombard the Prime Minister's official website with 1,000 service requests per second - launching the programme with a 'Fire!!!' button.

The software assaults - known as denial of service attacks - were announced on Twitter by hackers using the phrase 'Tango Down'.

Graham Cluley, a security expert at anti-computer virus firm Sophos, said: 'The attacks clog up the websites and make them difficult to use - imagine 15 fat men trying to get through a revolving door.

'These attacks have been used by Anonymous before and they may still be doing this now ready to launch another attack.

'It is one of the easiest ones they can do, which is why they do it.'

Most sites were not vulnerable to the attacks and seemed to be working normally this morning, but the MOJ admitted it had been affected by the hacktivists' assaults.

It would be 'suicide for Great Britain' if authorities tried to enter Ecuador's embassy to reach Julian Assange, the country's president said.

Rafael Correa said that if the British authorities forced their way into the London site to arrest the WikiLeaks founder, then other people should be able to gain access to British embassies in foreign countries.

Mr Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for questioning on sexual assault allegations, has been seeking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for two months, sparking a diplomatic row between the South American country and the UK.

Speaking on state television, Mr Correa said such a course of action would be 'suicide for Great Britain because then people could enter their diplomatic premises all around the world and they wouldn't be able to say a thing'.

He added: 'While the United Kingdom hasn't retracted nor apologised, the danger still exists.

'Remember that David beat Goliath. And with many Davids it's easier to bring down a number of Goliaths.

'So we're hoping for clear and coherent backing because this violates all inter-American law, all international law, the Vienna Convention and all diplomatic traditions of the last, at least, 300 years on a global scale.'
