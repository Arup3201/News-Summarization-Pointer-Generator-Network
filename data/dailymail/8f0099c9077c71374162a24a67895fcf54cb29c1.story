An extreme cold snap has seen a white blanket of snow covering parts of Victoria and NSW and causing some chaos in the process.

Farmers have been warned there was a high risk of losing sheep and lambs due to the icy conditions as a severe weather warning remains in place for Gippsland's west, south and east in Victoria after temperature dropped to freezing proportions overnight on Thursday.

Heavy snow caused problems on roads between Bathurst and the Blue Mountains and the closure of Orange Airport in NSW while strong winds were predicted to cause six metre waves off the coast in NSW.

Huge waves are also expected off the Illawarra, Batemans and Eden coast, with storm-force winds to whip up heavy surf conditions of up to three metres along the shoreline.

The Bureau of Meteroogy has also issued gale-force wind warnings for Sydney Harbour, Botany Bay and the Coffs, Macquarie and Hunter coasts.

Further south, blizzard conditions have been forecast for the Snowy Mountains in areas above 700 metres.

The snow also fell in outer Melbourne and near Ballarat as temperatures dipped as low as 2.1 degrees at Ferny Creek in Mount Dandenong at 11pm last night.

While below freezing temperatures were being experienced in the state's alpine regions with Falls Creek at -5.6 and -4 at Mount Baw Baw.
