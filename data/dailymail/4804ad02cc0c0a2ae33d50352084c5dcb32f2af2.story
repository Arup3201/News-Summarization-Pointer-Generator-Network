Zara Phillips is still hanging on to her Olympic hopes after moving into third place yesterday at the Bramham Horse Trials - the final event before the British eventing team for the Games is announced this week.

One spot is still believed to be up for grabs and Zara's clear round on High Kingdom in the show-jumping part of the competition in North Yorkshire put her right back in contention.

'The Olympics Games are on home turf so everybody wants to be there and I'm no different,' said Zara, 31, ahead of today's final event, the cross-country.

'Obviously, everyone is fighting to get on the team. It’s probably tougher for the ­ selectors than anyone else because the competition is so strong.'

The Queen's granddaughter added: 'We need to get through this weekend and see what happens.'

Zara has been written off by almost everyone, even her husband, rugby star Mike Tindall, warning against optimism.

With William Fox-Pitt, Mary King, Piggy French and Nicola Wilson virtually guaranteed selection, Zara is battling other leading riders for the one remaining place in Britain’s five-strong team.

And after following up an impressive dressage on Friday with a faultless round of jumping, Zara, who missed out on the Olympics in Athens and Beijing, is in the thick of the fight.

She said: 'There's more pressure now because [selection] hinges on one event.'

Ian Stark, one of three British team selectors, admitted that Phillips is in contention for the Games.

'Zara's been one we've been watching,' he said. 'Today hasn’t done her chances any harm, that’s for sure.

'Her horse is getting stronger and stronger.'
