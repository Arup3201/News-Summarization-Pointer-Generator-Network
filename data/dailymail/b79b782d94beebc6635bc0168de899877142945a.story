Adam Lallana was back in Liverpool training ahead of his possible debut against Aston Villa this weekend.

The 26-year-old joined the club in a £23million summer move but picked up a knee injury after returning from the World Cup and has not featured since.

The former Southampton man is now back to full fitness and could make his first appearance for the club in their clash against Villa in the Premier League on Saturday.

Paul Lambert's side have made an impressive start to the season, sitting third in the table having won two of their three games.

Brendan Rodgers' task has been made harder by the news that Daniel Sturridge could miss up to two weeks with the thigh strain that caused him to sit out the recent England game against Switzerland.

Mario Balotelli will likely lead the line in Sturridge's absence but Rickie Lambert could also feature after an impressive cameo against Switzerland.

In the absence of Daniel Sturridge Liverpool will be increasingly reliant on 19-year-old Raheem Sterling
