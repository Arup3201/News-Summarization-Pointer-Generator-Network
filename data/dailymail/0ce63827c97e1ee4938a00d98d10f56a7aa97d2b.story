An employee has been crushed to death today after a SUV fell six feet from a lift and trapped him at a parking garage, authorities said.

The man, named as Victor Victorino, 45, was working at Icon Parking in the Tribeca area of lower Manhattan around 8am this morning.

Emergency crews responded but the man was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the New York fire department.

Investigation: The NYPD has launched an inquiry after a man, named locally as Victor, was killed in a horrific accident on Monday morning

Mr Victorino is a father-of-three and a cancer survivor, friends told the New York Daily News.

His family, who live in the Bronx, arrived a short time after the tragic incident and were taken into a nearby building.

Icon Parking garage is close to the city's financial district and is popular with commuters who live outside of Manhattan.

The company is one of the biggest operating in Manhattan and has built up more than 200 parking locations in its 50 years in business.

Police were investigating the fatal incident at the underground facility. Early reports said that Mr Victorino had elevated the vehicle and was getting out of it when it rolled on top of him.

Vehicle lifts are used in garages across the city to save space by allowing one vehicle to be parked under another.
