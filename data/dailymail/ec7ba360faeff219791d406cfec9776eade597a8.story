An Egyptian-born mother of twins who believes women are hindered by ‘a sticky door’ rather than a glass ceiling yesterday landed one of the biggest financial jobs in Britain.

Dr Nemat Shafik [corr] will become only the second female deputy governor of the Bank of England in August.

The 51-year-old, still known by her childhood nickname of ‘Minouche’, will be taking on a job on which every family’s fortunes in Britain depend.

Nemat Shafik, 51, will become the second ever female deputy governor of the Bank of England in August

As well as helping to set interest 
rates, the Bank said Dr Shafik must also mastermind the ‘eventual exit’ 
from its £375billion quantitative easing programme, more widely known as
 ‘money printing’.

It is the
 latest extraordinary twist in the meteoric career of a woman whose 
childhood experiences might have thwarted others’ ambitions.

She
 was born in Alexandria, Egypt but her family forced to flee at the age 
of four to escape General Nasser’s nationalisations of the 1960s.

Robbed
 of their possessions, they fled to America, and Dr Shafik has 
subsequently said the traumatic experience has left ‘a strong legacy’.

She said: ‘My father in particular, I think, never got over that, having lost everything.’

But
 her career has been spectacularly successful ever since, becoming the 
youngest-ever vice president of the World Bank at the age of just 35.

After
 leaving the World Bank, she moved to the Department for International 
Development, rising to become its permanent secretary between 2008 and 
2011.

Since April 2011, she 
has been the deputy managing director of the International Monetary 
Fund. Asked about the glass ceiling, Dr Shafik, who has ten-year-old 
twins, said the metaphor is ‘not a good one’.

At just 35 she became the youngest-ever vice president of the World Bank, and most recently worked as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund

In
 an interview in 2009, she said: ‘I know the concept of it is that it is
 supposed to mean that there is an invisible barrier. But it also 
implies that, if you could break through it, then everybody could get 
through and it is not quite that simple. In my experience it is more 
like a sticky door.

‘In 
order to get through it, you have to give it a nudge because it won’t 
open automatically. And it helps a lot if you’ve got allies on the other
 side of the door giving it a pull.’

Dr
 Shafik, who speaks English, Arabic and French, used to be married to 
the super-wealthy Mohamed El-Erian, the former chief executive of Pimco,
 the world’s largest bond house.

In 2002, she married Raffael Jovine, with whom she had the twins, and is also step-mother to his three daughters.

She
 has spoken of the struggles faced by mothers trying to combine a career
 with a busy family life, saying she is often ‘guilty’ of working in the
 evenings at home.

She said:
 ‘The fact is I can get home, have dinner with my kids, put them to bed 
and then do some work after they’ve gone to sleep.’

Dr Shafik, who is a national of Britain, America and Egypt, will be paid a basic salary of around £260,000 by the Bank.

She
 will also be eligible to receive up to £78,000, equal to 30 per cent of
 her salary, if she chooses not to join the Bank’s generous pension 
scheme.
