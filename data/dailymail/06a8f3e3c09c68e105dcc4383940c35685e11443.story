A father delivered his wife's baby outside a Royal Mail sorting office - just minutes after watching a TV drama on midwives.

Sean Kirk, 35, had to spring into action after his wife Learose, 30, realised baby Adele Cara was going to arrive before they reached the Bristol hospital.

Mr Kirk, from Yate, was driving his wife the eight miles to the maternity ward at Southmead when Mrs Kirk told him they were going to run out of time - and he turned around to see the baby's head already visible.

He pulled into a layby next to the 
Bristol Royal Mail sorting office and had to deliver his wife's baby on the spot.

Bizarrely, the couple had watched BBC programme Midwives just minutes before they were caught up in their own delivery drama.

Mr Kirk, an emergency services worker, said: 'We watched a programme about Midwifes on TV coming up to the labour and I was at the births of our three older children as well so I knew roughly what happened.

'It was just a stroke of luck that the baby was not breech or stuck, or she was not breathing or something.

Desperate measures: The husband and wife had to stop beside the Royal Mail regional sorting office near Bristol because the baby was already crowning

'With the other babies it took maybe 12 hours of labour but this happened within the space of 20 minutes and I was not expecting that at all. I thought I was in for the long haul.

'I had hoped that as we were only ten minutes away we would make it to the hospital but Learose said the baby was coming and I had a look and I could see the head.

'It was all quite surreal really.'

Baby Adele arrived two days early, on August 9, weighing a very healthy 6lb and 12oz.

Mrs Kirk said: 'It was all rather shocking. Sean was driving rather fast because he was trying to get me to hospital in time when it suddenly dawned on me that I was going to have the baby where we were.

'We were nearly at the hospital when I told Sean, "it’s coming, it’s coming".

'We pulled up and by the time Sean had run to the other side of the car where I was sitting in the passenger seat, the baby’s head was coming out.

'There was no time to find the phone or anything. We had just watched Midwives on television and luckily nothing serious happened. It was just a really strange scenario.'

Adele is the couple’s fourth child, after Aiden, five, Annabelle, three, and Aliyah, 19 months.

The midwife team at the hospital leapt into action thinking Learose was about to give birth when the couple arrived.

But, having realised they had missed the crucial moment, they allowed Mr Kirk to cut the umbilical cord.

Mrs Kirk added: 'Sean had to point out to me where Adele was delivered when we were on the way home from the hospital because I had been in so much pain.

'He is so smitten by Adele and I think he does feel more of a special bond because he delivered her. His friends are now calling him midwife too.'
