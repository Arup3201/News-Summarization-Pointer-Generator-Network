Choosing to get up on stage to tell jokes for a living while battling anxiety would be the job from hell for most people but not for Felicity Ward - she sees it as a gift. 

‘I really love being on stage - it’s a lot of fun making people laugh it’s a really good job,’ she said.

‘Sometimes I was just performing for my life thinking “I’ve just got to get through this” but now I’ve got a dream job – sometimes they don’t laugh at me but that’s alright.’

Working as a comedian hasn’t always been enjoyable for the 34-year-old, who spends half her time in Europe and the other half at home in Australia, she had to hit rock bottom before climbing her way back to the top again.

Felicity Ward takes up the challenge of breaking down the stigmas around mental health

Ward's life began to spiral completely out of control three years ago almost ending her award-winning career

A self-confessed binger drinker, Ward made the tough decision to give up alcohol more than seven years ago because she was simply sick of feeling sad.

Then slowly but surely anxiety began to creep into her life until three years ago when she turned 30 and her life began to spiral completely out of control almost ending her award-winning career.

‘I had this other heckler in my head talking incessantly telling me that I’m a piece of sh** and that I should get off stage, and that I’m going to wet myself, and that these people hate me, and I should just leave,’ she said.

‘I would always be drawn to the green exit light in every venue, so I had to not look at that or the little voice in my head would say "get off stage - run through that door" so that was happening for 15 minutes of an hour-long show for months.’

In Ward’s ‘craziest’ period she began having angry conversations with herself before going on stage.

‘I was telling my anxiety that it needed to p*** off for an hour and if it wanted to come back double strength that’s fine,’ she said.

‘You find yourself cutting deals with your mental illness, so that just got unbearable and I was going to stop doing stand-up so I had to go and get help.’

Ward sought help and used her anxiety as part of her stand-up act in her comedy show, Honestly, a few years ago.

She has also learnt that regular sleep and exercise is vital for her frame of mind. 

‘Seeing a therapist was nothing short of a miracle from how bad it was to how good it got so quickly with her,’ she said.

‘I think the biggest fear is that if you go to see one it is validating that you are insane but the thing is it’s fine to have a mental illness.’

‘One in five Australians had a mental illness in the last 12 months – that’s 20 per cent of our country – that’s a national emergency.’

She has learnt to embrace her mental health and to manage it through regular sleep and exercise.

She also feels privileged that she had chosen a job that gives her the platform to speak candidly about her condition.

Her candidness about the topic led to the ABC approaching Ward to do a documentary on anxiety and she jumped at the chance.

Hence Felicity’s Mental Mission was born, where she takes up the challenge of breaking down the stigmas around mental health. 

Teaming up with Mental Health Australia, Ward bravely takes on a mission to get 3,000 promises on their online ‘promise wall’.

If her campaign is successful, she promises to face her fears and fly upside down in a stunt plane.

Ward was frustrated to discover that when she started telling her comedy pals about her anxiety that many of them also suffered from the condition but had never discussed it with her

A study in the U.K of 500 comedians showed that the people who worked on the stage had high levels of psychotic personality traits.

‘We are often highly neurotic and sensitive – we just need a hug,’ Ward said.

Ward was frustrated to discover that when she started telling her comedy pals about her anxiety that many of them also suffered from the condition but had never discussed it with her.

‘When I started to get well I told them about it and I was so angry that they didn’t tell me,’ she said.

‘I just wanted them to tell me so I didn’t feel like a freak - that’s when I realised how little we talk about this.’

It’s not just fellow comedians who share their stories in the two-part documentary but also Australian musicians Missy Higgins and rapper 360.

‘I’m very grateful and felt very privileged that I got to speak to them and they felt comfortable enough to speak to me about it,’ she said.

‘Missy experienced pretty full on depression as a teenager and she had a breakdown while she was at school and she spoke plainly about how she has been on and off medication at different points in her life.’

Hip hop artist, 360, spoke about starting to get anxiety attacks when he first rose to fame.

‘Exercise has become imperative to him – he’ a really big advocate of that and he stopped drinking as well because he was using it to medicate for his anxiety,’ she said.

The most confronting moment while filming the documentary was when Ward had a panic attack on camera after she was asked to sing a song with two other comedians.

‘I walked up to the director and said I was having a panic attack and that I couldn’t do it and she said “I know this sounds insensitive but would you mind going with you diary cam”.’

Surprisingly, Ward did not find it daunting to talking through such a personal moment on camera.

‘I just talked about my anxiety attack and just tried to explain the physical and mental effect that it was taking ,how it was caused and what the repercussions are so that people understand what it is like to have an anxiety attack,’ she said.

Although Ward has learnt to manage with her anxiety – she still goes for the occasional ‘top–up’ with her counsellor every now and then when she starts to see the cracks showing.

‘Things as simple as I found myself stuttering a lot when I was on and off stage and that was a little indication that I was getting mentally loose or I wasn’t getting enough sleep – I learnt a couple of little red flags,’ she said. 

Felicity's Mental Mission airs on Monday, October 6 at 8.30pm on ABC2 and also an encore screening Thursday, October 16 at 9.30pm on ABC.
