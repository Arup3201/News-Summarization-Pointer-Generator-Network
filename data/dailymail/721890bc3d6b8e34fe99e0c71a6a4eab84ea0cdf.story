Faced with two young children desperate for the lavatory during a visit to the opticians, Avril Tye discreetly asked if they could nip to the loo.

But staff at Specsavers recommended she leave the premises or risk the children wetting themselves – because using the staff toilet was impossible for ‘health and safety reasons’.

Mrs Tye, 43, took her three children – Bethan, eight, Lottie, seven, and William, four – to her local Specsavers in Hertford last Monday.

Having come straight from school, Bethan and William complained they needed the toilet. But the staff suggested Mrs Tye take the youngsters down the road to Starbucks to relieve themselves instead.

Mrs Tye, a writer, said: ‘It sounded so incredible. I said to them, “surely you can bend the rules for a child?” It was bonkers.’

As the branch was running late for Bethan’s eye appointment, Mrs Tye thought there would be no problem in letting the pair use the toilet.

She said: ‘I asked the girl on the desk, but she said they only had the staff toilet and customers couldn’t use them.

‘She then asked an older woman, who was very matter of fact and said no. She was quite curt.

‘I sat down again for another five minutes, and by this time Bethan was feeling quite uncomfortable and embarrassed.

‘I knew that if little William wet himself there would be tears. We didn’t have any spare clothes for him, so I was wondering what I was going to do.

‘It’s a very uncomfortable situation to put a mum with three children in to.’

As Bethan went in for her eye test, Mrs Tye became desperate and called the Specsavers press department in head office on her mobile phone.

She told them she was sitting in one of their branches and that staff had banned her children from going to the toilet.

She said: ‘I asked them whether it really was their corporate policy to force me to leave my child behind and run the other two down the road.

‘He stuttered a bit and then said there may be boxes in the corridor which posed a Health and Safety risk and that was why.

‘I told him they were putting health and safety above children’s needs, and then he said he would call the shop.

’Five minutes later, the store manager emerged, having spoken to head office.

‘She confirmed that for health and safety reasons, she was unable to let customers use the staff toilets,’ Mrs Tye said.

‘She asked me whether I would take legal responsibility for the children if she made an exception, and I just burst out laughing at the absurdity of the situation.’

At this point, the two children were allowed to relieve themselves and head outside after their ordeal.

Mrs Tye said: ‘At 8 years old, Bethan would have been mortified to wet herself and William would be sobbing.

‘I honestly think the whole episode was crazy, given the store prides itself on being family friendly.

‘This was a store full of female staff, all presumably mothers and yet they didn’t have the common sense to let young children go into the back and use the toilet.’

A Specsavers spokesman said: ‘We are sorry for any inconvenience caused to Avril and her children.

‘The health and safety of our customers is always at the forefront of our minds. The store does not have a designated customer toilet.

‘The only staff toilet has access issues as it is located off the shop floor. Under the circumstances a decision was made to let the customers use the toilet at their own risk.’
