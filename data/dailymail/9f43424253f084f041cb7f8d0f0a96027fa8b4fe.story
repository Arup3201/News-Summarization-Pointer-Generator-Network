Before and after: Joanne and Tony Young were both clinically obese, left, and suffered health problems, but after joining Slimming World they lost six stone each in 18 months are now say they are happier than ever, right

The couple, who have a son Bradley, 11, lost six stone each after joining a weight-loss programme 18-months ago, which pushed them to swap crisps and takeaways for fruit and salad.

Joanne, 34, who is nine weeks pregnant and expecting her second child in January 2015, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I found out that I was pregnant. I was crying as it was so overwhelming.

'We had been trying for a baby for eight years and nothing was happening. We knew that there was nothing wrong with our fertility and I was devastated that I couldn't get pregnant.

Happy: Tony, left, is now 18st 9lbs and Joanne, right, is 14st. 'We have totally transformed our eating habits and I feel so much better,' says Joanne, who feared her heavy weight would lead to diabetes

'I had resigned myself to the fact 
that I wasn't going to have another child. We are just so excited and 
can't wait to have our baby at the beginning of next year, it's 
amazing.'

NOWBreakfast: 35g of porridge oats made with  water and semi-skimmed milk, with blueberries and strawberries. Coffee.Lunch: Omelette with lean ham, full tin of baked beans, fruit.Dinner: Kebab meat, fresh salad of red and white cabbage, red onion, cucumber, chips.Snacks: Fruit, yogurts, vegetable sticks with homemade dips, lean ham spread with pease pudding and a packet of crisps.

The couple's 
weight had gradually increased over the years as they slipped into bad 
eating habits, eating regular takeaways and junk food.

When Tony began to suffer severe pains
 in his chest and struggled with back and leg problems, the pair made 
the move to seriously slim down.

'I
 was told by my doctor that if I carried on as I was then within a few 
years I would be dead,' says Tony.

'I was petrified about the thought of
 leaving my wife and young son behind.'

Tony had considered undergoing weight-loss surgery but Joanne felt the risks of the operation were too great and she was keen for her husband to drop the pounds naturally.

They signed up to their local Slimming World and began eating healthily and exercising.

Tony is now a lighter 18st 9lbs and 5ft 9ins Joanne is 14st.

'We have totally transformed our eating habits and I feel so much better,' says Joanne, who feared her heavy weight would lead to diabetes.

'At my heaviest I was tired and 
depressed. I used to put on a front of being happy when I was out with 
friends.

'I felt I had to be the funny and outgoing one as I thought 
everyone was looking at me.

'Now
 I can go shopping and pick up any item of clothing without having to be
 in a plus-size shop.

'Since I've lost the weight everything that I've 
wanted has happened.

'I'm at a really good point in my life.'

THEN:Breakfast: Cup of tea with biscuits.Lunch: Toasted cheese sandwich on white bread, bag of crisps, chocolate bar.Dinner: Pizza and chips with garlic sauce and can of Coke.

NOW:Breakfast: Two slices of wholemeal toast with a tin of beans. Coffee.Lunch: Homemade vegetable soup, fruit salad with a yoghurt.Dinner: Chilli, with rice and side salad, roulade with berries.Snacks: Fruit, vegetable sticks dips, yogurts, lean ham or chicken, Freddo chocolate bar.

Tony,
 who is 6ft, used to wear clothes size XXXXXL as his waist was 68ins. He
 is now a size XXL and his waist has dropped to 42ins.

But the biggest benefit for the 
dad-of-one is that his slimmer figure means he will be able to do more 
activities with his new child, something that he missed out on with 
Bradley.

Tony said: 'I'm over the moon at 
losing weight as I have more energy and do more activity.

'Before I 
couldn't even walk to the shops without being out of breath.

'We
 have always wanted a brother or sister for Bradley and when we found 
out that Joanne was pregnant I broke down in tears. I'm happy that I'm 
now at a weight where I will be to do more.

'I was so heavy that I could not kick a 
ball with Bradley and I do feel guilty about that, I wish I had lost the
 weight many years ago.

'It feels like I've been given a new lease of life.'

The pair would like to thank their Slimming World consultant, Hilary Donnison, for her help and support.
