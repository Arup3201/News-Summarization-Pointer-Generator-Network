A farmer's daughter who says she was left at home ‘with a muck fork’ while her sisters went out dancing has triumphed in her fight for a fair share of her family’s £7million estate.

Eirian Davies, 45, who was nicknamed the ‘Cowshed Cinderella’, claims she was assured by her parents that she would ultimately take over the thriving farm and its pedigree milking herd.

But following a row they began proceedings to evict her, while she began a legal campaign to secure what she said was her rightful share of the farm in South Wales.

Eirian Davies won her legal campaign to secure what she said was her rightful share of the farm in South Wales. Her parents have now seen their challenge against that decision dismissed at the Appeal Court

Miss Davies won her case and yesterday a challenge by her parents, Tegwyn, 75, and Mary, 76, was dismissed by the Appeal Court.

Lord Justice Floyd, sitting with Lords Justice Richards and Underhill, said he hoped the family would now resolve their differences in relation to her entitlement ‘without recourse to further costly and divisive litigation’.

Miss Davies told the original hearing that she missed out on going to Young Farmers’ Club dances with her two sisters, Enfys and Eleri, as a teenager because she had to stay at home to deal with her chores at Caeremlyn Farm.

Her parents apparently told her that her patience would be rewarded. ‘They always told me that the farm would be left to me,’ she told the hearing.

‘Even on my birthday, when the other girls were having things, they would say, “You will have the damn lot one day, it will all be yours”.

She claimed that her sisters once paraded through the poultry shed in their ball gowns while she prepared turkeys for Christmas.

Her father would regularly warn her ‘not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg’ if she complained about her treatment, she added.

Miss Davies claimed that until she reached the age of 21, she was paid nothing at all for her work on the farm and, after that, there was a period when she was paid just £15-a-day for milking the cows, although sometimes she received more.

She was said to have a ‘passionate interest’ in the herd and, by 1989, was the only daughter at the farm after her sisters began other careers. And, when she left to work elsewhere, her father was said to have begged her to return.

Although there was evidence that her parents had ‘pinned their hopes’ on Miss Davies over the years, they became increasingly annoyed by her relationships with men.

Lord Justice Floyd said this concern was not so much the men involved but ‘any children that they had and how that may impact upon their duties to keep the business in the family’.

‘Her mother referred to a string of men, to whom she referred as “wretches”, with kids behind them,’ said the judge.

Despite their deteriorating relationship, Miss Davies claims she was shown a draft will in 2009 that left the lion’s share of the farm to her.

However, her parents subsequently proposed to place the farm in trust for the benefit of all three sisters equally.

Family relations hit rock bottom in August 2012 during an altercation during which milk was thrown over Miss Davies by her mother, and she and her father ended up entangled on the floor, where she bit her father’s leg.

It led to the legal battle in which Mr and Mrs Davies sought to evict their daughter from the farm cottage, where she still lives close to her parents’ farmhouse, while she fought for her share of the farm.

At the original hearing, Judge Milwyn Jarman QC ruled that Miss Davies had relied on her parents’ promises and thrown herself into working on the farm. She was thus entitled to a ‘beneficial interest’ in the business.

Dismissing her parents’ appeal against the ruling, Lord Justice Floyd described the dispute as ‘in many ways a tragic case’.

‘The bitterness between the parties was such that each had few, if any, good words to say about the other,’ he said.

‘The fact remained, however, that between them they had over the years built up a prodigious Holstein pedigree milking herd and a highly successful business.

‘It is greatly to be hoped that they might now be able to resolve such remaining differences as they have in relation to Eirian’s entitlement without recourse to further costly and divisive litigation.’
