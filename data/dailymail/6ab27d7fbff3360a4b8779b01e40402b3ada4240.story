Manchester United are watching £30million-rated Palermo striker Paulo Dybala.

Club scouts were present at their weekend game against Inter Milan where they also watched Inter striker and Chelsea target Mauro Icardi who scored twice in a 3-0 win.

The 21-year-old Dybala, who has been tipped as the new Sergio Aguero in Argentina, can play as a striker or right winger and has impressed in what has been his breakthrough season.

Dybala has impressed this season and has been watched by representatives of Manchester United

The Argentine has netted nine goals in 17 appearances this season and that has not gone unnoticed by those at Old Trafford. 

Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool have also been represented at games this season and Palermo president Maurizio Zamparini is resigned to his departure in the summer but has hit out at his purported agents.

'This year he has exploded, but I already knew that he was very good,' said Zamparini.

'The boy is now in the hands of some people who don’t wish him well. It’s difficult to see him staying at Palermo. 

'He’s a great lad, who has been corrupted by bad advice. Now he’s advised by people who only see him as money making tool and nothing else.

'Dybala is worth over €40m but I won't sell him until June. Many foreign clubs asked after him, including Manchester United.

'I told the English side that he is not for sale right now, but we can talk about it again in six months. In my view, he is the best striker in Europe at the moment.'

United, meanwhile, who agreed a new two and a half year contract with defender Paddy McNair, 19, yesterday, retain an interest in Paris St Germain defender Marquinhos also.
