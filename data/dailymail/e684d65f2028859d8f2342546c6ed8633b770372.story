A Garda spokesman said:  'Gardai were called to meet the aircraft following an allegation of an assault on a female Aer Lingus air hostess. A Garda was also assaulted during the course of the arrest.'

The Irish Times reports the air hostess' foot was fractured after O'Riordan allegedly stamped on it during the incident.

She was taken to the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick for assessment and treatment. 

It was also alleged that she headbutted and spat at the arresting officer, who did not require hospital care.

O'Riordan's agents did not respond to a request for comment.
