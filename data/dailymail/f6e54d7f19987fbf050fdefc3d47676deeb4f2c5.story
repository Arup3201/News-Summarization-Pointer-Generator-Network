Victim: Kayla Ann Hendrickson was found shot to death along Highway 6

A 16-year-old girl found killed on a motorway died of gunshot wounds, Oregon state police said.

Kayla Ann Hendrickson, from Beaverton, Oregon was found dead along the Highway 6 east of Tillamook, late Friday night.

The only suspect involved in her death, Jacob Allen Green, 24, reportedly shot himself in his car the following day.

According to police Ms Hendrickson and Mr Green, from Newport, knew each other.

Mr Green, who worked for a Newport area logging company, shot himself in
his parked car in Humboldt County, California.

He later died in hospital and is so far the only suspect in 
the investigation into Kayla Ann’s death.

His vehicle matched the one seen by witnesses on Highway 6 around 10.15pm Friday night.

It was described as an unknown make or model late 1980′s to early 1990′s
full-size pickup was observed stopped on the north side shoulder of the
westbound lane on Highway 6 between milepost 18 and 19.

Two people, a man and woman, were seen along the highway near the car.

About 25 minutes later another witness reported ‘suspicious 
circumstances’ at the same spot, where the responding state trooper 
later found Kayla Ann Hendrickson’s body.

Oregon state police said in a statement that Mr Green 'shot himself and died later at an area hospital.

'The joint investigation between Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and Tillamook County Major Crime Team confirmed the deceased male is known to Hendrickson and is tentatively believed to be involved with her death.'

Police ask that anyone with information about the case, including anyone
who was traveling in the area at that time,  call state police at 
800-452-7888.

Investigation: Police are still investigating the two deaths although it has been established they knew each other (file photo)
