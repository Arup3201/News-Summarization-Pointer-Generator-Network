A video posted to YouTube takes pranking to a horrifying new level as a young man who accepts a lift from a Los Angeles bus stop witnesses what he believes to be a mafia hit.

The prankster, Josh Paler Lin, has a YouTube channel dedicated to his passions - 'house music, comedy and pranks' - and the video has been viewed more that half a million times in two days.

For his latest prank, Lin took one very unlucky passenger on a terrifying ride in which he pretends to be a mafia hitman.

So far, so normal: Josh introduces himself to Josh Lin, the prankster

While waiting at a bus stop, a young man known only as Josh is approached by another commuter who introduces himself as Cody and makes small talk.

The two discover they're waiting for the same bus when a driver, Lin, recognizes Cody pulls up and offers him a lift. Cody asks if his new friend can come with them, and though Josh demurs at first, he finally accepts the ride from Lin.

Early into the drive screaming and banging can be heard coming from the trunk.

Lin tells Cody it's a man who owes his boss $60,000 and that, 'he's not supposed to wake up,'

Pure, authentic fear and panic begins to appear on Josh's face.

Lin pulls over to quieten down the man in the trunk, baseball bat in hand, and returns to the car satisfied there won't be any more noise.

'Y-you can... I can just like... I can like call... Call somebody and...' Josh stammers.

'Don't call anybody,' orders Lin as he cleans 'blood' off the baseball bat.

As the trio continue, Josh looks around wildly as he is driven to what can only seem to Josh at this point as his demise.

'Um, excuse me,' he says in a barely audible voice.

Strange noises: Josh hears screaming and banging coming from the trunk of the car

Silent treatment: Lin emerges from the car and appears to violently beat the person in the trunk

Strike: A horrified Josh catches sight of the bloodied baseball bat as Lin returns to the car

'Where are we going?'

Lin tells him they're dumping the body and that he will drop him off at his destination after.

Josh's eyes are huge with fear and disbelief.

'I'll dump the body, and then I'll drop you and Cody off. Relax! We're almost there,' Lin says.

They eventually pull over in remote looking scrub to 'dump the body.'

As Cody and Lin carry the body, wearing a very bright red bloodied t-shirt, the boy puts a shocked hand over his mouth.

It becomes too much for him and he tries to get out of the car but discovered the doors have been child-locked.

Cody and Lin get back in the car after dumping the 'victim' on the side of the road. Lin grabs a gun from the glove box, to Josh's horror, and heads back out to the victim.

Horror: Josh looks on as Cody and Lin dump the 'body' by the side of the road

Getaway: He tries to make his escape but the car's child safety locks are on

Money shot: Poor Josh looks on as Lin appears to shoot his victim

Josh breathes raggedly and looks around in desperation for a way to escape.

Lin stands over the body as the boy begins to murmer, 'Oh no, oh no, no, no,' before the sound of a shot fired echoes.

The boy sits upright, staring out the window and not looking at Lin or speaking a word.

Lin makes a call to his 'boss' then begins questioning the boy as to whether he was in Colombia last week and if he is working for the Anti-Mafia Organization.

The boy, flinching, says he doesn't know what that is and he was not in Colombia last week.

Terror: When Lin gets back in the car, Josh can't even look at him

Jig's up: Lin and Cody finally give up the pretense and tell Josh he's the victim not of the mafia but of a prank

As Lin threatens Josh with the gun, he starts laughing. Cody in the back seat also starts laughing and the boy looks at them in surprise before Lin informs him that he's being pranked and that there's a camera on the dashboard.

The boy looks unconvinced, looking towards the bloodied body on the roadside.

'He's an actor, he's an actor,' Lin says, calling, 'Hey!' to the corpse, which rolls over and gets up.

'He's an actor bro, this is a fake gun, dude,' Lin says putting it in his mouth.

Rising from the dead: The corpse miraculously returns to life after appearing to have been viciously beaten and then apparently shot

Hilarious? There aren't many people who would be amused by such a malicious prank being pulled on them, but Josh looks extremely relieved

With the dawning realization that the horror he had just witnessed wasn't real, the boy's face floods with relief.

The next shot is the bewildered boy being asked to sign a release form so that Lin can use the video and the boy can 'be on YouTube.'

The video ends as Lin promises to take the boy out to eat at a buffet - small payment for the ordeal he's just been put through in the name of fun.

Lin posted the video Tuesday, writing that it was 'one of the hardest and craziest pranks' he's ever pulled.

He said it took two weeks to find someone who would actually agree to get in the car with Cody and that they took poor Josh to a restaurant after the prank.

'He said he will NEVER jump in to a stranger's car EVER again,' wrote Lin.

'Lol.'
