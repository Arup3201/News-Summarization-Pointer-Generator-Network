Country sensation Taylor Swift caught major waves at the Teen Choice awards last night, scooping up six surfboard trophies including one for Ultimate Teen Choice.

Swift, who soared to popularity in 2006 at age 16 with her self-titled debut album, won a total of six awards: 
choice female music artist, country female artist, female red carpet 
fashion icon, country single for 'Mean' and break-up song for 'Back to 
December.'

The 21-year-old crooner was also 
honoured for her contributions to entertainment with the Ultimate Choice
Award, the show's version of a lifetime achievement award.

Top of the board: Taylor Swift emerged as the top winner at the Teen Choice Awards tonight, scooping six gongs - seen here collecting the Ultimate Choice Award

Accepting her Ultimate Teen Choice 
surfboard onstage, Swift thanked her fans and joked: 'It's been a long 
time since I was a teenager, like two years.'

She noted how teenagers often are 
teased by adults because they are 'intense' or 'romantic,' but she 
encouraged kids in the audience and watching at home on the Fox TV 
network, saying: 'I think all those things are amazing things, and to 
all the teens watching, I hope you never lose those things.'

The
Teen Choice Awards are an annual stop on Hollywood's award circuit and 
give actors, musicians and other artists who are popular with kids the 
chance to thank their fans.

On the crest of a wave: Taylor collects a gong from actress Emma Stone

Selena
Gomez, who performed her hit single I Love You Like a Love Song with 
her band The Scene, won five awards, including choice TV actress in a drama for her role in 
Wizards of Waverly Place.

She was also named choice 'hottie,' 
and The Scene scored the award for top band and for single of the year 
with their song Who Says.

The
19-year-old Gomez also saw her boyfriend, Justin Bieber, scoop up four 
surfboards. Despite arriving separately, the couple sat together at the ceremony and kissed, putting to bed rumours they had split.

Adding to his collection: Justin Bieber, 17, was named top male artist and earned an acting award for his recent work on television, seen with friend Sean Kingston onstage

Bieber picked up four surfboard-shaped trophies as 
choice male music artist, male hottie, twit and TV villain for his 'CSI'
guest starring role.

But perhaps the most poignant honour 
was not a Teen Choice surfboard, but a special 'Inspire' trophy that 
went to Demi Lovato, an 18-year-old singer and actress who late last 
year pulled out of a concert tour to enter rehab for abuse issues.

Since
then, Lovato has talked openly about her problems with eating disorders
and cutting herself that she linked to being bullied at school when she
was younger.

Look what I've got: Cameron Diaz accepted the award for Choice Movie actress, seen right host Kaley Cuoco

Something to get their teeth stuck into: Vampire Diaries stars, from left, Michael Trevino, Kat Graham, Nina Dobrev, and Ian Somerhalder accept the Choice Sci-fi/Fantasy TV Show award

Thank you: Gossip Girl Blake Lively won the trophy for TV actress while a smiling Demi Lovato won the Inspiration award after a difficult year

And she started a foundation called Love Is Louder Than the Pressure to be Perfect to help kids combat peer pressure.

'You guys are what got me through this
last year,' she said to screaming fans at the Teen Choice Awards. 'Love
is louder, I love you guys so much.'

'The Big Bang Theory' leading lady 
Kaley Cuoco hosted the 13th annual extravaganza at Universal Studios 
Hollywood's Gibson Amphitheatre.

Congratulations: Twilight hunk Taylor Lautner presented the award to Lively, who looked stunning in a tight orange dress

Between dispensing awards like candy,
Cuoco battled 'Chuck' star Zachary Levi in table tennis, danced 
alongside 'America's Best Dance Crew' winners Poreotix and jokingly 
quizzed teenagers about current affairs.

There were moments of seriousness 
amid the silliness. Sean Kingston made his first live televised 
appearance since recovering from injuries he suffered after crashing a 
watercraft into a Miami Beach bridge in May.

Other winners who picked up 
surfboard-shaped trophies included Cameron Diaz as choice movie comedy 
actress for 'Bad Teacher,' Ellen DeGeneres as choice comedian and Ashton
Kutcher as choice romantic comedy movie actor for 'No Strings 
Attached.'

Goofing
around: Ashton Kutcher, who won the Movie Actor award for his romcom No
String Attached, started singing Katy Perry's Teenage Dream during his 
acceptance speech

Off,
off, off! But Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was no amused by the 
performance. Kutcher beat Fergie's man Josh Duhamel, who was also 
nominated in the category for Life As We Know It

Before leading the crowd in a singalong of Katy Perry's 'Teenage Dream,' Kutcher provided some topical advice.

'Don't ever charge anything on a credit card if you don't already have the money in the bank to pay for it,' he said.

The ceremony ended with a tribute to the 'Harry Potter' film franchise.

The final two instalments apparently 
bewitched online voters, winning such categories as choice 
sci-fi/fantasy movie, liplock, villain for Tom Felton and summer movie 
star for both Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe, who accepted his 
surfboard via satellite from New York.
