Jenna-Louise Coleman plays Clara Oswin Oswald

When it comes to wooing women, the Doctor might do well to take a leaf out of Matt Smith's book.

While the lovestruck Time Lord struggles to develop a deeper relationship with his new travelling companion Clara Oswin Oswald in the new series that starts this week after locking lips with her in the Christmas Special, Matt won over the actress who plays her with a simple blend of kindness and enthusiasm.

Or, as the actress who plays Clara, Jenna-Louise Coleman, puts it, 'He totally blew me away. I'd worked on all these carefully prepared ideas and accents for my audition, but everything just went out of the window when Matt started to talk and move around in the rehearsal room.

He was like a hurricane, full of fantastic ideas and spontaneity. He started playing different characters I could bounce off and made me feel as if he were auditioning himself, he got so into it.

'I remember thinking how fantastic it would be if I actually got the part, how great it would be working with Matt. And that's exactly what's happened. Matt's the perfect leading man and sets such a lovely tone on set, making the atmosphere wonderful. There's really not much more you could ask for in your co-star.'

In typical Doctor Who fashion, Jenna's introduction to the series has been anything but straightforward. She made her debut in an episode last September, playing a character called Oswin Oswald who was trapped inside a Dalek.

Then she reappeared in last year's Christmas special as Clara Oswald, a Victorian barmaid who met an unfortunate end. Her 'third entrance', as she calls it, sees her playing Clara in the present day, now a governess in a London suburb to two children who've lost their mother.

'She meets the Doctor when he turns up on her doorstep dressed as a monk, so that's her first impression and I had to treat it as a completely clean slate. But this is the Clara, or at least  the essence of her, that you'll see from now on,' says Jenna, 'for the rest of the current series and into the next one too. And after that? Who knows...'

The big question, of course, is how far their fledgling romance that began with that Christmas kiss will go. Jenna's not about to spoil it for the fans (although she does refer to the Tardis as 'a kissing booth' in this week's episode), but reveals Matt Smith was keen to stoke up some chemistry between them.

Once she'd landed the part, he suggested she watch some classic Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy movies such as Woman Of The Year and Without Love that made much of the sexual frisson between the two actors.

'He thought they'd be useful in understanding the rhythm and pace of a relationship between a male and female lead, and they were. He also suggested I watch some Indiana Jones films - which I'd never seen before - because the main character's always accompanied by various women on his adventures.'

Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy famously had an off-screen affair, but that won't be happening with Jenna and Matt. The lantern-jawed actor may have recently revealed he's single again after his on/off romance with model Daisy Lowe ended and he hasn't been slow in paying Jenna compliments, describing her as 'hot' and 'stunning-looking on screen'.

But Jenna's been in a relationship with Game Of Thrones star Richard Madden for the past couple of years, and when the cameras aren't rolling she and Matt seem more like conspiratorial friends than anything else, a couple of mates enjoying being involved in one of TV's most popular shows.

They take particular delight in welcoming guest stars to Roath Lock, the studios in Cardiff where the show is filmed. Matt's introduced Jenna to a game called The Uncomfortable Touch, where he greets a guest on their first day on set with what might be deemed an over-familiar display of affection - a hand on the arm, shoulder, perhaps even bottom, just to gauge their reaction.

This kept Matt and Karen Gillan, the Doctor's former assistant Amy Pond, amused for hours. Some people though, reveals Jenna, are exempt. 'There were no liberties taken with Dame Diana Rigg when she turned up for an episode later in the series, Matt and I just watched her from afar, fascinated by the dynamic between her and her daughter Rachael Stirling, who also plays her daughter on the show.'

Jenna-Louise says filming Dr Who is always enjoyable, 'even when it's soggy'

Rubbing shoulders with dames was the last thing on her mind when Blackpool-born Jenna, now 26, began her career as Emmerdale's Jasmine Thomas, a part she landed at the age of 19 and continued in for almost five years. After a stint on BBC1 drama Waterloo Road, the role of cheeky Cockney maid Annie Desmond in Julian Fellowes' Titanic brought her to a wider audience. But it's Doctor Who, with  its loyal fans ('Although I can honestly say I haven't received a single love letter or marriage proposal since I joined,' says Jenna) and the almost iconic status his assistants assume, that will cement her in the nation's consciousness.

After a pretty gruelling schedule she's now putting the finishing touches to the current series before taking a well-earned rest this summer while Matt Smith travels to Detroit to film his role in the Ryan Gosling movie How To Catch A Monster. Then it'll be back to work for the star-studded 50th anniversary special, which is rumoured to have lots of old doctors on board and due to be shown in November. 'It's been tough at times,' admits Jenna.

'The third episode in this current run, called Cold War, is set on board a Russian submarine and marks the return of the classic Doctor Who monsters the Ice Warriors. Before every take in that episode they'd come and spray us with water, so we were soaking wet for two weeks.

'But Doctor Who is always hugely enjoyable, even when it's soggy. There's a scene in tonight's first episode where the doctor comes revving out of the Tardis on a motorcycle and he and Clara travel across London. I'm sitting there with my hands around Matt's middle, riding across Westminster Bridge on a motorbike with the Houses Of Parliament in the background and thinking, "This is fun, this is really good fun."'

The most difficult thing about the job, she says, is trying to keep the vow of secrecy that's a prerequisite for anyone involved with the show - something Jenna got an early taste of when she first went for the part and was forced to throw friends and family off the scent by telling them she was auditioning for a TV comedy in Cardiff. 'I've had to learn to say a lot - because there's so much interest in Doctor Who - without giving anything away. It's the nature of the programme. It's based on surprises and reveals, so the last thing you want to do is give away anything that might spoil it for the viewers.

'All I can say is that the Doctor sees Clara as a work in progress and a subject of both endless fascination - and frustration too,' she says. 'There's nothing the Doctor hates more than an unsolved mystery and Clara Oswald is exactly that. He won't stop until he finds out the truth about her. And that could take a while.'

Doctor Who, tonight, 6.15pm, BBC1.
