Surveillance video showing the tragic moment a 14-year-old autistic boy escapes from his Queens, New York, school only to turn up dead in the East River months later has been released for the first time.

An energetic Avonte Oqundo, whose distraught parents are suing the Department of Education for negligence, is seen in the footage bounding down the halls of his Long Island City special needs school and out of the double doors that were carelessly left ajar by an unidentified man more than 30 minutes earlier.

A security guard then comes to close them just three minutes after the teen slipped away.

Tragic moment: An energetic Avonte Oqundo, pictured, is seen in the footage bounding down the halls of his Long Island City special needs school and out of the double doors

Apart from a brief sighting on security 
video from outside the school, the heart-breaking October 4, 2013 
footage is the last time the teen is seen before he was reported 
missing. A massive manhunt failed to find the child, whose remains were 
eventually discovered in a nearby section of the East River this month.

Investigators are still awaiting test results to determine his cause of death.

However, the New York Post quotes police sources as saying they believe he fell into the water by accident and drowned.

The latest video shows the man, possibly a teacher, walking down the corridor at 12:08 p.m. and pushing through the double doors as he leaves. He fails to properly shut the doors behind him, leaving them ajar.

A little over 30 minutes later, Avonte runs down the same hall as if drawn to the crack of light between the open doors.

He pauses at the doors for a fraction of a second and then disappears through them.

Just three minutes later, a school security guard notices the doors aren't shut and closes them.Police released the previous video showing Avonte running from the Center Boulevard School once through the doors, during the search for the boy.

'Never again. Don't let children leave school between bringing them to school and getting them home. They can't disappear,' the family's lawyer, David Perecman, told ABC TV.

The family is suing the city, alledging school security was responsible for keeping Avote safe and failed. They also believe a search took too long to begin. However, the NYPD maintains that safety agents did nothing wrong.

Earlier this week, U.S. senator Charles Schumer proposed a new law in the name of the disabled teenager, which would fit autistic children with tracking devices.

He said 'Avonte's Law' would make it easier for authorities to find children with the disability who had gone missing.

Under the proposed legislation, a state-funded voluntary scheme would see children's clothes fitted with a small GPS system.

Standing with Avonte's mother, Vanessa 
Fontaine, and grandmother, Doris McCoy, Sunday, Senator Schumer said the
 family was going through a 'nightmare' and that steps needed to be 
taken to prevent a similar incident happening again.

Avonte, who had a form of autism that made him non-verbal, had been missing since October 4, when he walked out of his school toward a park overlooking the river.

His body was found in the river about 11 miles from where he vanished earlier this month. His disappearance sparked a massive citywide search that saw volunteers join forces with police.

In a program that would cost around $10 million and be overseen by the Justice Department, schools and parents would be issued with tiny GPS chips.

Currently in the US a similar system is used for locating Alzheimer sufferers.

Somber closure: Avonte Oquendo's mother Vanessa Fontaine seen through the casket of her son, Avonte, as it is brought out of Saint Joseph's Church in the West Village after a memorial service

River of tears: Weeping family and other attendees of Avonte's funeral lay flowers over his casket at it is prepared to leave for the burial

Outpouring of support: Dozens of the volunteers who handed out flyers with Avonte's picture on them and helped the search effort were on hand at the church Saturday

'There is no reason the same program 
that's been successful with elderly people with Alzheimer's who wander 
cannot be used for kids like Avonte who have autism and wander,' Senator
 Schumer said in New York, according to the The Wall Street Journal. 'The only barrier is the funding.'

Perecman backed the proposal, which he said could save lives.

Hundreds
 of grieving relatives, friends and sympathetic strangers came together 
Saturday for a funeral marking the tragic end of a three-month search 
for the missing autistic New York City teen.

The former Roman Catholic archbishop 
of New York, Cardinal Edward Egan, presided over the ceremony at the 
Church of Saint Joseph as Avonte's parents and brothers sat stoically in
 a front pew, next to a white casket holding the boy's remains.

'This
 morning we are grateful to God for Avonte Oquendo, for his life, for 
his courage, and for the acts of goodness and kindness that his life and
 his tragic disappearance evoked among us,' Egan said Saturday.

Heartbreaking task: An NYPD dive unit searches for Avonte's remains after an arm and legs were discovered along a rocky shoreline in Queens January 17

Case solved: The child's remains, including a skull, were found about 11 miles from where he vanished

'We
 know that he is safely in the embrace of the father in heaven and we 
thank that father in heaven for the years we had with him in our midst.'

A
 funeral home covered the costs of the service and a family-only wake 
beforehand, where about a hundred relatives sat together in a room full 
of white flowers watching a slideshow of the teen's photos.

'Nobody
 really wanted to speak,' said Roberto Colon, 49, whose wife's cousin is
 Avonte's mother. 'We couldn't fathom what to say.'

Vanessa Fontaine wept through the entire service, and neither she nor Avonte's other relatives spoke.
