Flight restrictions relating to drones and national parks, military bases and near airports are clear and strict.

But since unmanned crafts have become more popular, homeowners and businesses are increasingly concerned about the drones flying over their private property.

To allay these fears, a pilot from California has teamed up with drone makers to create a global database that lets anyone set up no-fly zones above their homes and offices.

To add a zone, users need to enter the location, their name and an email address to verify the request. This address is converted into a latitude and longitude point which is then sent to drone makers and added to a no-fly database. Many drones have technology that automatically prevents them flying over listed regions

To add a zone, users must enter their location, name and an email address to verify the request.

This address is converted into a latitude and longitude point, as well as a series of points that accurately marks out the edges of a property.

For the first property the site doesn’t ask for proof of residence, but for subsequent addresses users need to show a form of identification or utility bill.

The address is then sent to drone makers and added to a no-fly database used each time a drone takes off.

Many drones have technology that automatically prevents them flying over registered regions, for example. 

People who live near a blocked property and wish to fly their own drone, for example, must provide proof of residency.

NoFlyZone will unblock that airspace upon request, and people can unblock their property at any time.

At launch, founder Ben Marcus has partnered with manufacturers Horizon Hobby, Yuneec, Hexo+, PixiPath, Ehang, Drone Deploy and RCFlyMaps. 

By partnering with Mr Marcus, these makers promise to adhere to the registered zones but are not under a legal obligation to do so.

And the size of the zone depends on individual makers, although Mr Marcus recommends it covers 500ft (152 metres) around each property.

Other drone manufacturers are not obliged to comply to the no-fly zone you have established, however. 

Legally, drones can’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks, military bases and within a five mile (8km) radius of medium and large airports.

Commercial drones are additionally subject to stricter laws and regulation.

‘Evolving technology is allowing drones to have a positive impact on everyday lives through many applications. However, drones may also affect lives in a negative way,’ explained Mr Marcus.

‘Many people are concerned about their privacy and safety [and] NoFlyZone.org offers these people a method to control the airspace above their property and to prevent drones from flying over.

‘While the FAA and other similar regulatory agencies around the world struggle with implementing rules about drones, drone manufacturers and operators want to take a proactive step to self-regulate and deliver quality products and services while minimizing negative consequences.

‘Our service physically prevents drones from flying over opted-out property by including those areas in the drone's no-fly database.’

People who live near a blocked property and wish to fly their own drone, for example, must provide proof of residency.

NoFlyZone then unblocks that airspace, and people can unblock their property at any time.

The updates to the database aren’t made automatically, however.

The site sends the database to drone partners on a monthly basis, and any new drones produced after drone manufacturers are sent the latest database will include the latest properties. 

‘It could take some time before all in-service drones are updated to include your property in the no-fly database', continued Mr Marcus.

‘In the future, when drones are connected by internet, we plan to update your privacy settings by pushing the information to the drones over internet in near-real time.’
