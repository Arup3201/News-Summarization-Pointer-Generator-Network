Just days before TV doctor Phil McGraw will announce the results of Rebecca Zahau's second autopsy, it has been revealed that the twin sister of Jonah Shacknai's ex-wife was at the mansion in the hours leading up to her death.

Nina Romano, whose sister was married to Miss Zahau's Billionaire boyfirend before they divorced several years ago, said she went to the house in San Diego to get answers about six-year-old Max's death.

That same day, on July 13, Miss Zahau, 32, was said to have committed suicide at 3am  after hearing that her step-son Max - who 
had been injured in an accident at the Coronado home days earlier - was about 
to die.

Mysterious: The family of Rebecca Zahau are working with TV psychologist Dr Phil to investigate her death

Tragic: Max Shacknai died after his fall but a doctor allegedly said he may have suffocated

Miss Zahau's naked body was found 
hanging from the mansion's balcony with her ankles and wrists bound. Her
death was later ruled a suicide but her family have always maintained she was murdered.

The Zahau family attorney previously 
claimed that it was Mr Shacknai's ex-wife Dina who was at the mansion, but a 
source close to the investigation told Radar there was 'irrefutable 
evidence' that she was actually at the hospital by her son's bedside.

Nina Romano told the CBS affiliate in 
San Diego earlier this week that she went to the house to get answers 
about Max's accident.

She was staying at her sister's house, which is 
in close proximity to the mansion.

New evidence? Ms Romano, 41, was at the mansion shortly before Miss Zahau's death, but said she knocked on the door and left shortly after no one answered

Conflicting reports: An eyewitness has told police he saw Max's mother, Dina, and not her twin sister, at the mansion that night

Recalling a conversation she had with 
Miss Zahau two days before her body was found, she told CBS: 'I said 
to her, "Rebecca what happened? I heard Maxie was walking up the stairs 
and he had a cardiac arrest. That makes no sense to me".

'I said, "He's a six year old boy. He's a 
healthy boy. He plays soccer. He plays sports. I don't understand".

'And 
(Rebecca) just looked at me and she said, "I know". And I said, "Okay, well, where did he fall from? Did he fall from the 
first set of stairs, the little landing, the stairs going up, the top 
landing by the bedrooms, where did he fall from?"

'She said twice, "He fell from the bedroom. He fell from the bedroom".

'And I looked at her and said, "How do you know that? I thought you 
didn't see him." And there was no answer.'

During the two-hour interview 
detailing events, the 41-year-old said that she simply went over there that night 
for an explanation and for Miss Zahau to show her where she found Max.

She said: 'I just wanted to see for 
myself. That's why I went there. I just wanted her to show me how she 
found him because I didn't understand.

'I went up to the front door and rang the bell, nothing; rang the bell a second time, nothing. I knocked on the door.

'I looked through the glass, nothing. It didn't look like anybody was home. The kitchen was dark, everything was dark.

'So I thought, that's kind of strange 
because her car's here; that light's on, that's weird. So then I just 
thought, "Maybe she just doesn't want to talk to me".

'So, I turned around and I left right away and I walked back to my sister's house, got ready for bed and went to sleep.'

Nina Romano was the last person to text Miss Zahau, asking if she could come over. Miss Zahau did not reply.

On Monday and Tuesday Miss Zahau's family will appear on the Dr Phil show, along with the family attorney.

A source told RadarOnline: 'There will be new developments that have been discovered that will be revealed during the shows.'

Although authorities closed the case 
into Miss Zahau's death, they have said if new evidence comes to light 
they will reopen it.

Max Shacknai was found unconscious at 
the base of the stairs at his father's vacation home in California.

Getting involved: Psychologist and TV personality Dr Phil Mcgraw is hoping to solve the mystery of Rebecca Zahau's death

The boy's death was determined to be an accident by the San 
Diego Medical Examiner.

However, the boy's physician, Dr Brad
Peterson of Rady’s Children’s Hospital, was quoted in a search warrant 
saying suffocation may have occurred prior his fall.

In search warrants that were just 
released by a San Diego judge, the Coronado Police Department quoted Dr 
Peterson saying Max's visible injuries were not consistent with the 
cardiac arrest and brain swelling he suffered.

His neck was broken and he was found not
breathing and with no pulse by Ms Zahau at the bottom of the stairs 
after she heard a noise and came to look.

Miss Zahau and her teenage sister Xena 
were the only people at home at the time of Max's accident.

Police contend
that Rebecca was in the bathroom at the time of Max's accident, and 
that Xena was in the shower.

Mr Shacknai has two children with his 
first wife, Kimberly. Max was his only child with his second wife, Dina,
whom he divorced in 2008.
