If Diego Costa had cost £100million he would still be worth it. What an introduction to English football the Spain international has made.

He took his goal tally to seven in four games since arriving from Atletico Madrid for £32m with a hat-trick against Swansea, the only other club with a 100 per cent record going into this clash, as Chelsea stayed top of the Premier League.

No wonder Roman Abramovich was on his feet beaming like a child on Christmas morning by the time Costa had completed his treble. Chelsea have searched for two years to find Didier Drogba’s replacement. Needless to say they have found it.

‘If the team plays well, he has to score goals,’ said Jose Mourinho. ‘Seven in four is maybe too much. It is something that is not normal. We cannot expect that after eight matches he will have 14 goals.

‘Everyone knows now why Chelsea did well to wait for him rather than buying one in the midwinter last season, just to buy a striker.

‘Didier had a fantastic career at Chelsea. Diego has shown he can have that same profile of career, but we don’t need to compare careers.’ All this after a week of recuperation at Chelsea’s Cobham HQ following a hamstring strain sustained on international duty.

However, the ease of Saturday's win was certainly not reflected in their start, as Garry Monk’s side stormed into an 11th-minute lead. It was slick too. Left-back Neil Taylor latched on to Ki Sung-Yeung’s defence splitting pass before rolling in a low cross from the left.

The Welshman’s pass was destined for Nathan Dyer at the back-post but John Terry, in attempting to cut out the cross, thumped the ball past Thibaut Courtois into his own net.

The travelling support were in a frenzy. Their manager, however, was motionless on the touchline. He must have been bubbling over inside though, as his side’s excellent start to the season showed no sign of letting up. Bafetimbi Gomis and Wayne Routledge both went close to increasing Swansea’s lead as Chelsea struggled during the opening exchanges.

Dyer, in front of England manager Roy Hodgson who was watching in the stands, and Gomis in particular were causing Chelsea problems.

If Swansea had gone 3-0 ahead, Mourinho could have had little complaint.

The visitors were bright, inventive and dangerous. Chelsea on the other hand were lethargic, sloppy and inefficient.

Slowly but surely, however, Mourinho’s men awoke from their Saturday afternoon slumber.

Andre Schurrle and Cesc Fabregas wasted free-kicks, both won by Eden Hazard, in threatening positions, before Oscar failed to direct a header goalwards following a cross from Branislav Ivanovic.

The Brazil international then saw his low effort from the edge of the penalty area saved by Lukasz Fabianski, before Hazard fired a cross-come-shot wide after an excellent pass by Fabregas. Chelsea were not merely turning the screw, they were tightening it. So it was no surprise when the home side pulled level in the final minute of the first half. The scorer was not a surprise either.

It was, of course, Costa with the simplest of headers from Fabregas’s corner after some slack Swansea marking, as the Spaniard became the first Chelsea player to score in his first four games for the club since John Meredith in 1928.

Costa nearly scored again in the 52nd minute but his goalward volley from another Fabregas corner deflected off Hazard before flying wide. 

But he did not have to wait much longer — just three more minutes in fact — finishing off an attractive move to score his sixth of the season, one more Premier League goal than Fernando Torres scored in the whole of the last campaign.

Fabregas and Hazard cut Swansea’s left-hand side to shreds with some intricate passing, leaving Costa to fire the Spaniard’s cut-back past Fabianski to put Chelsea ahead.

Their abject start was a distant memory now; Chelsea were vibrant and threatening, looking every inch title contenders.

And Costa sealed all three points for Mourinho’s men with another simple finish, tapping past Fabianski after Ramires’ mishit shot from the edge of the area.

The striker was given a huge ovation, perhaps the biggest round of applause coming from owner Abramovich, as he was replaced by debutant Loic Remy with 20 minutes remaining.

And it took the France international just 10 minutes to open his account following his move from QPR, firing an unstoppable right-foot drive past Fabianski after Oscar’s pass.

Jonjo Shelvey scored a consolation for Swansea four minutes from time. ‘Maybe we should have added one or two after going ahead but second half you saw the power and quality Chelsea have. We couldn’t quite contain them,’ said Monk.

‘We were committed, had a good attitude and tried to play well but I think they’ll be champions.’

It is hard to argue with the Swansea manager on this evidence.

Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas combined to devastating effect as they continue to prove just why so many felt Chelsea won the summer transfer window. Costa now has seven goals in his opening four Premier League games, with Fabregas recording six assists.

LINK UP

Fabregas laid on for two of Costa’s three goals in a display that showed an underlying understanding the pair have already manufactured. Even though they are both Spain internationals and have played together fleetingly before, the sharpness with which they already read each other’s games will be alarming to title rivals.

LOOKING UP

Fabregas’ first movement when picking up possession in midfield is to look for the run of Costa. The striker can come short as well as spin off defenders, offering different options for his midfielder.

TEMPERAMENT

Statistics rarely lie: Costa now has a remarkable seven goals after 14 attempts on goal this season. Fabregas, therefore, knew not to panic when the Blues went one down. There is a calmness about both that means Chelsea rarely lose sight of the bigger picture - even if behind in games.

THE MOURINHO EFFECT

Jose Mourinho noted Fabregas’ willingness to get forward during a dispiriting first half during which the Spaniard was caught out of position all too often. The manager pushed Fabregas further forward at half-time and he enjoyed the run of Stamford Bridge.

BETTERING CHELSEA

It’s fairly simple how Chelsea have already benefitted from the pair signing at the Bridge. Costa now has more league goals than Fernando Torres managed throughout last season while Fabregas intuition in the final third has lessened the creative burden on Eden Hazard.
