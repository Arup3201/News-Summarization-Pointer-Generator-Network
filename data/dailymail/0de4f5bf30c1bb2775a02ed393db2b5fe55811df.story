Allowed to stay: Killer Jermaine Rutherford, 29, has avoided deportation to Jamaica by saying he would be in danger in the 'homophobic' country

A second Jamaican has escaped deportation at the last minute by claiming he is homosexual – despite being convicted of murdering a schoolboy.

Jermaine Rutherford, 29, stabbed the 15-year-old to death over a £10 debt while in England on a temporary visa.

He was due to be sent back to the Caribbean upon completing his prison sentence. But while awaiting deportation – ten years after a judge said he should be kicked out – Rutherford belatedly declared he was gay, and would be in danger in ‘homophobic’ Jamaica. The Home Secretary said his claim should be rejected ‘on credibility grounds’ – but the Court of Appeal ruled that he could stay in London.

The Mail told yesterday how another Jamaican thug, Alvin Brissett, avoided deportation at the eleventh hour when he claimed to be a homo-sexual while sat in handcuffs at Gatwick airport. The father of two has won the right to remain here due to his human right to a ‘family life’ – despite a string of convictions for drugs possession, assault and robbery.

The success of Rutherford is even more shocking, given his conviction was for murder. The full details of his case can only be revealed after the Daily Mail challenged a judge’s anonymity order.

A woman claiming to be Rutherford’s ex-girlfriend says he ‘is not gay’, and even told her while he was behind bars that he planned to avoid deportation by claiming to be homosexual.

Kay Carroll, 23, said: ‘He came out of prison a year and a bit ago and I’ve seen him quite recently. We were boyfriend and girlfriend. He’s not gay as far as I know.

‘He always made out as if he loved the girls – but I do remember when he was in prison he said something about planning he was going to say he was gay.’

The details of the killer’s victorious appeal emerged amid concern that the number of foreign criminals avoiding deportation rose by 50 per cent last year. The figures prompted the Conservatives to draw up plans to limit the role of the European Court of Human Rights in Britain.

Rutherford won the right to stay in the UK at the Appeal Court in April, which ruled he could not be sent to Jamaica as he could face inhuman or degrading treatment for being gay.

Three judges rejected an appeal from Home Secretary Theresa May, who had been fighting to send him back to the Caribbean ever since his release from jail in late 2012.

Catherine Rowlands, acting for the Home Secretary, argued that ‘the claim of homosexuality was contrived and brought as a last resort to avoid deportation’.

But the Court of Appeal heard ‘compelling’ evidence from Rutherford’s mother, who said she ‘knew all along’ that her son was gay, and that his ‘late disclosure’ was ‘prompted by societal attitudes, particularly that of Jamaicans towards gays’.

Ruling in favour of Rutherford, Lord Justice Kay said: ‘This case turns on its specific and quite unusual facts. It should not be seen as providing more general succour to others convicted of grave crimes.’

The parents of Rutherford’s victim, Abdul Maye, were last night too upset to comment.

Rutherford was 16 at the time of the crime, and had come to England from Jamaica on a temporary visa to visit his mother.

He and a 14-year-old friend sold cannabis to Abdul, but when Abdul failed to pay up, the pair felt they had lost face. Armed with large knives, they attacked Abdul in front of his classmates at the school gates. They denied murder but were convicted at the Old Bailey.

At the time, the trial judge said Rutherford had to be deported after leaving prison, saying: ‘You are a Jamaican national and within months of coming to this country you committed murder. I am of the view that your continued presence in this country will be detrimental to its citizens.’

No comment could be obtained from Rutherford, but he is understood to deny that Miss Carroll was ever his girlfriend.
