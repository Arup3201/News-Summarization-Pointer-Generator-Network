A housewife called the RSPCA animal cruelty hotline for help when her husband refused to get out of bed to take their pet dog for a walk, it has been revealed.

The request was released on a list of the charity's top 'silliest calls', which ranged from a person complaining her cat was not responding to calls to come home, a woman who wanted the RSPCA to come out and teach her dog the green cross code and a man who was worried about a bird perched on a telephone line.

Other calls included a confused motorist who called them instead of the RAC and someone who wanted to know where to get a CD full of bird sounds.

The RSCPA has seen a rise in the number of silly or prank calls, which is stretching its resources in the busy summer months

The list was released as the over-stretched charity asked people to think carefully before calling.

A person complaining her cat was not responding to calls to come into the house.

A caller who wanted the RSPCA to go out and teach her dog the green cross code.

A caller who was worried about a bird perched on a telephone line.

A person who was watching a film where an animal had been attacked.

A caller who was angry because she had seen a report which said children were behaving 'like animals'. She was disgusted because 'animals don't behave badly'.

A confused motorist who called them instead of the RAC.

Someone who wanted to know where to get a CD full of bird sounds.

A woman who couldn't get her husband out of bed to walk the dog.

Someone who thought they had spotted Bigfoot.

A concerned woman who witnessed animal abuse - in a film more than 40 years old.

A spokesman for the RSPCA said staff always expected a higher level of calls in summer months, but crank or silly calls wasted their time.

The hotline has seen an increase in calls of 65 per cent since January.

The spokesman said: 'Calls about stubborn cats, mythical creatures and birds on a wire put unnecessary strains on services during the summer.

'This is at a time when the RSPCA get more calls about dogs in hot cars, animals wounded in airgun incidents or animals dumped in the holidays - all of which must be a top priority for the charity and increase during the lighter summer months.'

RSPCA chief inspector Dermot Murphy said: 'Summer has always seen surges in demand but like many charities we are facing a big rise in calls at a time when our resources are under most strain.

'Much as we would like to help, we simply haven't got the staff to personally investigate each and every issue that the public brings to us, so we must prioritise to make sure we get to the animals most in need.'

The charity advised callers that local authorities dealt with stray dogs and police needed to be involved with animals left in hot cars, while injured wildlife should be taken to a vet and information on the RSPCA website should be consulted first before calling the charity.
