Teenage heptathlon star Morgan Lake has pulled out of England’s team for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, partly because her father is not allowed to stay in the athletes’ village.

Lake’s father, Eldon, is also her coach and would therefore have been eligible for accreditation, but would have only been allowed day passes into the athletes’ village.

Team England will provide chaperones for all athletes at the Games who are under 18 — including 13-year-old diver Victoria Vincent and weightlifter Rebekah Tiler, 15 — but there is no scope for parents or guardians to stay among the expected 6,500 athletes in the village.

Disgruntled: Teenage heptathlon star Morgan Lake has pulled out of England's team

Team: British heptathlon star Lake with her father and coach Eldon Lake

Lake, 17, has just finished her AS Level exams but has already broken Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s British junior heptathlon record. She is also second behind Johnson-Thompson on the Under 20s all-time list after scoring 6,081points in Gotzis, Austria last month.

Lake’s preference this summer was to do the heptathlon at the World Junior Championships in Oregon, USA and then the high jump in Glasgow, but British Athletics would not allow her to double up.

She will now hope to be selected for Great Britain’s team at the World Juniors from July 22 to 27, — a single-sport, much smaller event than the Commonwealth Games. This would allow greater contact with her father and might also be a better option for her exciting long-term prospects.

But Lake cleared a high jump personal best of 1.93m in Loughborough in May, the second highest jump by a British athlete this year, and could yet earn her first senior international vest this year at the European Championships in Zurich next month.

The reasons behind Lake’s withdrawal from the Commonwealths should enable England to call up another athlete to replace her and compete alongside Jessica Taylor and Johnson-Thompson, the favourite for gold, if required.

Meanwhile, marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe has announced she will race competitively for the first time in more than two years as she targets one final attempt at the London Marathon on 2015.

Foot surgery ruled Radcliffe, 40, out of the London Olympics, but she will run in the Worcester City 10k on September 21.
