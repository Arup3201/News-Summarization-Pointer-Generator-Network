Over the years, the French have often sought safety by fleeing over the Channel to Britain.

But a book by a Frenchman who has lived in London for 13 years complains that those in the UK are unwelcoming and unfriendly towards them.

Author Josselin de Roquemaurel says that not only is England expensive, the public services are inadequate and the natives look upon them mockingly.

Author Josselin de Roquemaurel said the British love visiting France, but that French people moving to the UK find it expensive and to have inadequate public services

He said while the British love visiting France and revel in French culture, an age-old rivalry prevents them from being fond of its people or accepting them into their community.

‘The Englishman doesn’t really want to see us,’ de Roquemaurel writes in La Reine, la City et les Grenouilles (The Queen, the City and the Frogs).

‘He has no desire to include us in his social universe.’

De Roquemaurel, 35, from a wealthy Parisian family, has lived in London nearly half his life.

He says it is fashionable for French residents to claim they have one or two English friends.

But the so-called friend often turns out to be half French, married to a French person or someone fluent in the language.

He claims a French bachelor in London is more likely to marry a Mexican or a Pole than a Briton,

Mr Roquemaurel, an executive in a private equity company, draws on his own experience having met his French wife in London.

His book, which appears in French shops this week, warns those intending to move to the UK to expect mockery of their heavily accented English, which can prevent success in the business-world if you want to be taken seriously.

‘A banker cannot afford to make his interlocutors laugh or even smile,’ he writes.

Mr Roquemaurel said he thought of London as more like a French 'border town' because of the number of French people living there

Mr de Roquemaurel, who has two young children, also criticised how English people cannot speak French properly.

‘They study French as though it were Latin, a dead language,’ he writes.

He complains that his surname is commonly mispronounced and is told his first name, Josselin, sounds more like a girl’s.

The former banker comments on the British obsession with property, struck by how newspapers, he claims, are full of gratuitous references to the value of people’s homes.

He was surprised to be quizzed by a taxi driver about how much his property was worth. ‘I can’t imagine having a conversation like that with a taxi driver in Paris,’ he said.

However, he does acknowledge that London has become the capital of global finance — his main reason for being there — and describes it as the heart of the art world.

He admits the restaurants aren’t as bad as the French may think and that fashion industry is getting better.

But just as you thought he was giving the UK the credit it may deserve, he claims much of Britain’s success is based on the efforts of talented foreigners - many of them French.

A lot of Britain’s top chefs were taught by French masters and many of the football stars in the Premier League are French, he writes.

He adds that living in London is more like a French ‘border town’, given the volume of French people living there.

De Roquemaurel says it is common to hear French complain about how expensive London is and how the NHS doesn’t live up to their own healthcare system – despite many still using it.

But the father of two has no intentions of returning to his homeland and even told the Sunday Times last week that he was thinking of putting his children into an English school.

He has acceded to the property craze too, buying a home in ‘little France’, otherwise known as Kensington, west London.
