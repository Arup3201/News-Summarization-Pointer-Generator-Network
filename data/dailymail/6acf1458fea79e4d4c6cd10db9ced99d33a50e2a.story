An estate agent is accused of raiding $500,000 worth of possessions from a $7.6million house he'd just sold to a New York socialite.

Gallery owner Tina Kim and her husband Jae Chung bought their home in West 81st Street, New York City, with the help of realtor David Kim last December.

But the family never changed the locks on the doors, allowing the 42-year-old to allegedly let himself in and empty the property of their belongings.

Art lover: Tina Kim's gallery is on the third floor of this building on New York City's West 25th Street. The socialite's family home was allegedly emptied by her real-estate agent after she went on holiday in the Hamptons

Ms Kim and her husband, who employ a maid, nanny and personal driver, were relieved of possessions including rare artworks, high-end fashion accessories and credit cards.

A police source told the New York Post that Kim, who is no relation to Ms Kim, 'decorated his apartment by framing the artwork on his walls.'

The suspect, who was arrested last week, is said to have stolen almost everything from the victims' home, 'even humidifiers, cigar boxes and all the woman's purses', including one worth $90,000.

Kim knew the family was leaving New 
York City for the Hamptons on August 16 and crept into their town house 
through the service entrance, police sources said.

High fashion: Pricey Louis Vuitton accessories were said to be among the possessions Kim helped himself to from his client's family home

Over three consecutive days he is said to have taken away possessions including Louis Vuitton accessories, a Gucci wallet, a crystal pen, electronics and artwork, storing the haul at his apartment in the same block.

Court records claim that on seven occasions he also used one of the victim's credit cards to make $50,000-worth of purchases in various shops.

The family called police after returning home on August 19 to find their home plundered. Officers are said to have recovered the stolen property from David Kim's apartment.

Lance Fletcher, the suspect's private attorney, said: 'There’s been no evidence linking him to the apartment where the burglary occurred except for the alleged proceeds from the burglary.'

Ms Kim has run the Tina Kim Gallery in Chelsea since 2007, after first setting up in Manhattan's 57th Street five years earlier.

She has said that if she was not an art dealer 'I would probably be on the other side, as an art collector.'
