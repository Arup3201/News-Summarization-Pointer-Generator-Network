Kung-fu kicks are a common theme in this Holland World Cup squad.

Klaas-Jan Huntelaar’s exuberant celebration after scoring Holland’s winner against Mexico was the latest in a trilogy of kung-fu antics, as he acrobatically followed in the footsteps of midfielder Nigel De Jong and boss Louis Van Gaal.

Their kung-fu kicks were in slightly different circumstances though.

VIDEO Dutch party rumbles on

Four years ago De Jong’s flying lunge into Xabi Alonso’s midriff in the World Cup final somehow only merited a yellow card from referee Howard Webb, while Van Gaal has also got previous when it comes to performing amateur martial arts inside a football stadium.

So outraged was he that his Ajax side were not awarded a free-kick during the 1995 Champions League final against AC Milan, he mimicked Marcel Desailly’s high-foot challenge, jumping into the air in front of the fourth official and karate-kicking thin air.

Painful: De Jong's studs go straight into Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso's stomach during the 2010 final

Patrick Kluivert was a member of that 
Champions League-winning Ajax team, in fact the Dutch striker scored the
 winning goal against Milan, in the 85th minute.

And Kluivert is now 
part of Van Gaal's coaching staff for the national side. After the final
 whistle Huntelaar went straight to Kluivert and the pair embraced on 
the pitch at Estadio Castelao.
