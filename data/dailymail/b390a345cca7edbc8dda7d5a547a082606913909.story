A woman serving a 22-year sentence for her role in a deadly attack on an elderly man when she was just 14 years old has had her sentence reduced.

Washington state's clemency board recommended on Friday that Marriam Oliver should be released in three years.

Oliver, who is now 26, has already served 12 years for her part in a group attack on a 64-year-old man who was beaten and stabbed to death in his Everett home in 2001.

After a two-hour hearing that was packed with family members and supporters of Oliver, the state's Clemency and Pardon's Board unanimously voted that Oliver should be released in three years, as long as she doesn't have any infractions on her prison record during that time.

The recommendation will be sent to Governor Jay Inslee, who will have the final say but it is not known when he will make that decision.

Oliver was one of five teenagers and an adult, Barbara Marie Opel, who pleaded guilty or were convicted in the trial for the fatal attack on Jerry Heimann in his home.

Although she was 14 at the time of the 
attack, Oliver was tried as an adult and received the lower end of the 
sentencing range for first-degree murder.

She was found guilty of taking part in the attack, helping her friend and Opel's daughter Heather, stab Mr Heimann, who had cancer.

As the teenagers stabbed and beat their victim, Opel was said by prosecutors to have waited in the basement with her two youngest children, shouting encouragement, according to Komo News.

At the trial of Opel in 2003, prosecutors said the 38-year-old had promised the teenagers, including her own daughter, money and gifts if they attacked her landlord, so she could steal $40,000 he had made from the sale of a house.

Opel's daughter Heather was to be given a dirt bike and her friend, Oliver, skate money, according to Seattle Weekly.

At today's hearing Oliver, who testified before the four-member board by telephone, cried and had to pause frequently as she recounted the crime.Â
