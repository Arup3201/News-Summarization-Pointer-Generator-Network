Bayern Munich are on the verge of launching a surprise move to sign Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, reports in Germany are suggesting.

The 23-year-old playmaker, who has been heavily linked with both Real Madrid and Manchester United this season, would be the third major Dortmund star in the last two years that Bayern had attempted to wrestle away from their rivals. 

Gundogan’s contract expires in the summer of 2015, and with a long-term back injury leaving his future form uncertain, Dortmund will certainly be considering cashing in on an estimated transfer fee of £25million this summer.

Real Madrid had previously been leading the race, with United also in the running, but according to German news magazine Focus, sounding-out talks have already begun at Bayern to investigate the possibility of the transfer. 

The news comes as a surprise, with Bayern having suggested only a few weeks ago that they were not looking to buy any more players from Dortmund.

Major transfers such as those of Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze – as well as the failed bid to lure Marco Reus to Munich when he left Borussia Monchengladbach – had left the relationship between the two clubs sour, with everyone from the chief executive to the stadium announcer at BVB accusing Bayern of attempting to weaken their rivals through financial muscle alone.

On Monday though, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge clarified that Dortmund players were 'not taboo' as transfer targets for Bayern. It would seem so, with Bayern now reportedly after Gundogan's signature.

The midfielder, who has not played since sustaining a back injury in Germany's 3-3 draw against Paraguay last August, may be lined up as a direct, long-term replacement for Bastian Schweinsteiger. 

Madrid remains the most likely destination for Gundogan if he is to go, with a swap deal for Nuri Sahin a strong possibility.

United, meanwhile, have also been linked with Gündogan. The Germany man would severely strengthen their midfield, and many are pointing to the similarities between this case and the transfer that saw United buy Shinji Kagawa from Dortmund two summers ago.

Like Gündogan, Kagawa had a year remaining when Dortmund chose to offload him to United, and had also gone through a long-term injury while at the Westfalenstadion.
