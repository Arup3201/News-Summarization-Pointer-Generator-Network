There can be no greater contrast between their respective sports.

One is genteel and elegant, the other two brutal and frenzied.

But yesterday Charlotte Dujardin, Nicola Adams and Jade Jones all found themselves in the same position, making Olympic history for Britain.

Winning women: Yesterday Nicola Adams and Jade Jones found themselves in the same position, making Olympic history for Britain

Dujardin won gold in the individual freestyle dressage, Adams became the first women’s boxing champion and last night Jones triumphed in taekwondo.

In a bizarre twist, the latest gold rush came on a day when it emerged that staff working on BBC News bulletins had been sent a memo urging them to focus more on the achievements of other countries, and not just Team GB.

The message was sent by head of news Helen Boaden, following a complaint by Director General Mark Thompson, who is said to be ‘increasingly unhappy’ with the patriotic tone of the news coverage of the Games.

The BBC has been widely praised for 
its Olympics programmes, hosted by sports presenters including Clare 
Balding, Gary Lineker and Gabby Logan.

Last night a BBC source told the Mail: 'This is most definitely not 
about the sports coverage – it has been flawless – and it is certainly 
not meant to denigrate the sterling work of the presenters.

'This is about our Six O'Clock and Ten O'Clock news. We want to make sure the entire games is covered.'

The memo irritated staff and last night the
6pm news still began with the news of the British success, although the
10pm bulletin led on Usain Bolt’s success in the 200m.

After a Wednesday without any medals,
the triple win reinvigorated Team GB’s campaign, taking the number of 
golds won by the host nation to 25, the highest for 104 years.

It also raised the overall medal tally to 52 – well above the target of 48.

Memo anger: The message was sent by head of news Helen Boaden, following a complaint by Director General Mark Thompson.

Dujardin, 27, who already had a gold 
medal from team dressage, was the last competitor to go in the packed 
Greenwich Park arena.

She
rode her horse Valegro to victory accompanied by movie themes including
the Great Escape and Live And Let Die, and patriotic British tunes such
as Land of Hope and Glory and I Vow to Thee, My Country.

‘It
is unbelievable,’ she said. ‘It is always something I’ve known the 
horse could achieve, but I didn’t really know how I was going to find 
the atmosphere and the expectation.’

She pipped Dutch rider Adelinde Cornelissen while Britain’s Laura Bechtolsheimer, another team gold medallist, took bronze.

Dujardin
became only the fourth British woman to win double gold at one Games 
after Dame Kelly  Holmes, Rebecca Adlington and Laura Trott.

Over
at the ExCeL centre, the Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Anne and David 
Cameron were all among the crowd to see 29-year-old Nicola Adams, from 
Leeds, pull off an unexpected win by outclassing three-times world 
champion Ren Canan.

Winner: Dujardin came first in the individual dressage and her fellow Team GB rider Laura Bechtolsheimer took the bronze

History: Great Britain's Nicola Adams becomes the first woman to win Olympic boxing gold after victory over Ren Cancan at ExCeL

Proud: Jade Jones became Britain¿s youngest Olympic champion at London 2012 as the 19-year-old nicknamed the 'Head Hunter' claimed taekwondo gold

Later at the same venue, 19-year-old 
Jade Jones became GB’s youngest gold winner when she beat China’s Hou 
Yuzhuo 6-4 in the final of the taekwondo under-57kg featherweight 
category.

Britain’s 
third sailing medal is also assured as Luke Patience and Stuart Bithell 
are guaranteed at least silver in the 470 class.

The
pair are due to go for gold today against an Australian crew after 
their final race was delayed owing to lack of wind at Weymouth 
yesterday.

In the message to BBC staff, titled 'An order from
the DG', director of news Helen Boaden wrote: 'Mark Thompson is 
increasingly unhappy that we are focusing far too much on Team GB's 
performance to the exclusion of all else.

'This is also becoming a theme within the Press.

'As editor in chief, he has issued a 
directive that this needs to change from today. So you need to get 
cracking on making that shift.'

BBC news editors were irritated at the tone of Miss Boaden's email.

One insider told the Mail: 'We never get direct orders like this.

'It is only natural that our viewers 
and listeners want to hear about Team GB's successes. All the other 
countries celebrate their own medal winners.

'It would be a shame if we had to water down our coverage to satisfy an abstract notion of fairness.'
Indeed, last night's Six O'Clock  bulletin led on the two golds for boxer Nicola Adams and dressage rider Charlotte Dujardin.

Result! Kate beams as she applauds the victory as she sits with MP Nick Clegg and rower Sir Steve Redgrave on one side and Sir Timothy Lawrence and Princess Anne on the other

Raised the roof: David Cameron was also among the thousands of spectators who roared Adams to victory in London's ExCel

The Olympics coverage has come as a welcome success for the Corporation 
after its Diamond Jubilee presentation in June was attacked for being 
inaccurate and banal, and attracted almost 5,000 complaints.

Writing on the BBC's own online message board, viewers were quick to 
defend the BBC's coverage of the Games against charges of 'jingoism'.

One wrote: 'If you can't blow your own vuvuzela when you're the host nation, when can you?

'I think it's been a great games so far ... exceeded all expectations 
for me, and though the Beeb messed up the Diamond Jubilee on a grand 
scale, they have redeemed themselves with the fantastic coverage this 
week.'

Last night Mr Thompson said: 'I am as delighted as our audiences and the
whole BBC team about the brilliant performance of Team GB, and it is 
quite wrong to suggest otherwise.

'The BBC has been right to focus on sporting achievements which the 
whole country has been celebrating, and we will continue to do so with 
pride.

'We can do that while at the same time making sure that our news 
programmes fully reflect some of the other great sporting achievements 
and human stories of the London Games.'
