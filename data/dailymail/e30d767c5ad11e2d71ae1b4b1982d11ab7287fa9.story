If you didn't boast about it on Facebook, did it ever happen? The holiday brag is as common on social media as baby photos and cringe-worthy 'over shares'.

And with a honeymoon being the ultimate holiday for most couples, it has become a regular occurrence to share envy-inducing photos and 'check in' to the destination when they arrive.

Using this data, it has been discovered that Las Vegas is the most popular honeymoon destination in 2014 for Facebook users.

What happens in Vegas: Las Vegas is the most popular honeymoon destination for Facebook users, according to a new report

Checking in: The findings have been based on honeymooners 'checking in' to a destination on Facebook

The Nevada party capital topped lists for honeymoons both worldwide and within the United States, while Hawaii destinations featured prominently - taking up five of the top ten US destinations for Facebook check-ins.

Facebook based its findings on couples who 'checked in' somewhere more than 20 miles from their home location within two weeks of posting a marriage event on the social media site.

Surprisingly, no European destinations feature in the list of top ten worldwide honeymoon check-ins.
