Rhode Island is the marijuana capital of the U.S. according to new state-level research compiled in the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

According to the researchers, 13 percent or just over 1 in 8 of residents in the country's smallest state - also known as The Ocean State - smoke marijuana monthly.

The rate of toking in Rhode Island is more than three times the rate in Kansas, where only 4 percent of residents regularly indulge, while the national average was about 7 percent.

Other states where pot smoking is very popular included some more obvious candidates such as Colorado and Washington which have both legalized the recreational use of marijuana this year.

Western states tended to have the highest rate of usage, at 9 percent, while the South has the lowest overall rate at 5.83 percent, reports The Washington Post.

States in the highest group included were Alaska, Colorado, Montana and New Mexico, while states that partook least when the joint was being passed included Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia.

The most popular age group using marijuana on a regular basis was unsurprisingly those aged between 18- to 25-year-olds.Â 

Almost 19 percent of this age group has used marijuana in the past month, according to the NSDUH.

However the state-by-state variations in those numbers could be considerable.

In Vermont, more than one third of 18-25-year-olds regularly used marijuana, but the figure was less than 10 percent of the same age group in Utah.

Usage rates drop off considerably amongst people aged 26 and over and only 5 percent of people over that age said they still smoked marijuana on a regular basis.

Alaska was the state with the largest number of people aged 26-and-over who continued to regularly use marijuana, at 11.18 percent.

Together with Oregon, Alaska has marijuana legalization measures on their ballots this fall.
