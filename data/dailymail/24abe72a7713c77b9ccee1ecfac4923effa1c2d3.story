A year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, sales hit nearly $700million as 17 tons of the recreational buds were bought by consumers in the state's first year of full legalization.

However sales for medicinal pot still outstripped the recreational sales by almost 50 tons, according to officials.

In its first annual report, it was revealed that 49.7 tons (109,578 pounds) of medical marijuana flowers were sold in 2014, while 17.5 tons (38,660 pounds) were sold in the retail market, said the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division.

Sales hit nearly $700 million last year, with medical marijuana accounting for $386million and recreational pot bringing in $313million.

But recreational sales of pot-infused edible products, such as candies and cookies, outstripped medical sales by about 2.85million units to 1.96million, according to the report. 

In total, 4.81million units of edible marijuana were sold - which would equal giving one edible to almost every resident in Colorado, according to 9News.

In a national first, voters in Colorado and Washington state opted to legalize recreational marijuana use by adults in landmark twin ballots in 2012, and the first retail stores opened in Colorado on January 1, 2014.

States such as Oregon and Alaska, which have now also voted to legalize recreational pot as well as others where lawmakers face proposals to do so, are watching the Colorado results closely.

Findings also showed that 322 retail stores were licensed at the end of the year, up from about 200 six months earlier, while 833 licenses were issued to retail businesses in general, and 1,416 medical marijuana businesses were approved by the state.

It said medical businesses were cultivating around 300,000 marijuana plants on average each month during 2014, while the number of retail plants rose steadily from fewer than 25,000 in January to nearly 217,000 during December.

The report noted that more than twice as many Colorado jurisdictions had 'completely opted out' of allowing either retail or medicinal pot businesses to operate than had permitted them.

The state's marijuana laws have been challenged in federal court by neighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma, which argue weed is smuggled across their borders. Some Colorado residents said the pot industry has hurt their families, businesses or property values

Sixty-seven jurisdictions allow medical and retail licensees, 21 permit only medical, and five only retail, while 228 jurisdictions prohibit them both.

Supporters said voters have chosen to take the trade out of the hands of criminals, and a Quinnipiac University Poll this week showed that 58 percent of Colorado residents support marijuana legalization, versus 38 percent against it.
