A bullet signed by former Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle has been auctioned for $24,000, eight days after he was shot dead. 

Kyle, 37, who completed four tours in Iraq and wrote the best-selling book 'American Sniper', is believed to have been killed along with his friend by a fellow veteran earlier this month while at a North Texas gun range. 

Kyle was considered the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history.

A bullet signed by Kyle was bought by Lubbock lawyer Allen Adkins after local Texas businessman Ron Betenbough offered it to him but only if Adkins could match his bid of $12,000. 

Adkins did exactly that, taking home the same type of bullet that was used in his 1.2mile kill of an enemy holding a rocket propelled grenade in Iraq.

'I cherish this in the sense that I'm honoured to be, even in a remote way like this, associated with a great American like that,' Adkins told American news channel KCBD. 

'He was a very heroic person. He usually had one shot and if he didn't make his shot then he could be killed himself.'

The bullet was donated for the auction by Congressman Randy Neugebauer before Kyle's death on February 2, but Adkins says that he would have paid the same amount regardless.

'I will tell you that whether he had passed away or not, I would've done the same thing. He was a hero while he was alive and I respect him just the same.'

All of the money will go directly to the Heartline Women's Clinic which provides free services for women who are facing an unplanned pregnancy. 

Adkins said buying the bullet was honouring Kyle's legacy and that it was sad for the country to lose a hero. 

'I put him on the caliber of George Washington. He was a very brave soldier, and hard times bring forth great men and that's what he was. He's a great man.'

Kyle's flag-draped coffin was taken in a white hearse from his hometown of Midlothian, about 25 miles southwest of Dallas.

Around 200 vehicles followed the procession.

Many motorists pulled to the side of roads to watch the procession that included motorcycles, motor coaches, police cruisers and other vehicles throughout moments of light rain and even hail.

In Austin, hundreds of people gathered on roads stretching nearly a mile from the cemetery.

Many who came to watch the procession were combat veterans in leather jackets who parked their motorcycles three wide around the permitted area of the gravesite.

Others were businessmen in suits on their lunch break from the nearby Capitol, families with strollers and at least one jogger taking a break from an afternoon run.

An Iraq War veteran, Eddie Ray Routh, 25, has been charged with the killings of Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield.

Routh's brother-in-law told authorities that Routh had recently been diagnosed with PTSD.

Authorities say Kyle, Littlefield and Routh arrived together at the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, on the afternoon of February 2.

Routh later fled in Kyle's truck.

According to a search warrant, Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that the men 'were out shooting target practice and he couldn't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him.'

On Monday, some 7,000 people attended a two-hour memorial service for Kyle at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington. Kyle's coffin was placed at the Dallas Cowboys' star at midfield.

Crowds queued to enter the Cowboys Stadium so they could hear memories of a kind and loving family man, a practical joker and a proud veteran.

His widow, Taya Kyle, told the crowd she was broken but that her family would 'put one foot in front of the other' to get through their grief.

She said she told her two children that they will remember Kyle's silly side, Texas twang and the prayers they prayed together.

The couple's children wrote heart-breaking tributes to him on the memorial program alongside pictures of their parents wedding day.

'You are the best dad ever. I never wanted you to die, I miss your heart', one of the messages simply signed by 'Baby Girl' from Kyle's daughter read.

The other signed by 'Bubba' added: 'One of the best things that has happened to me is you. I love you dad. I always will.'

Kyle, who also received two Silver Stars, had worked tirelessly to support his fellow comrades since leaving the Navy in 2009.

The man dubbed the 'most lethal sniper in U.S. history' after killing 150 was the founder of a non-profit supporting veterans providing them with fitness equipment.

He and Littlefield, who wasn't a military man, regularly took veterans to the shooting range in order to support them.
