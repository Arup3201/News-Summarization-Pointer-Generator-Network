Casey Kasem’s second wife Jean will be handling funeral arrangements for the late DJ after his daughter Kerri agreed to her request to hand over his remains.

The pair had been at loggerheads in recent months as they battled in the courts over the broadcasting legend’s medical treatment.

Kerri Kasem had been granted custody last month over her father’s medical care, but that role expired when her father died Father's Day morning.

Broadcast legend Kasey Casem died on Sunday aged 82 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease and dementia.

An attorney for Kerri told TMZ that Jean's attorney had reached out to request the body be released to her. 

Kerri obliged immediately, and notified the hospice where Casey died that his wife would be taking care of funeral arrangements. The pair didn’t speak directly.

According to a recent filing of Casey's health directive he wanted a burial. Jean Casem will act as the executor of Casey's will.

Hiss death was announced on social media by his children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem. The message didn't include the name of
 his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly 
court battle over his medical treatment.

'Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,' the message read. 'Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken.

'Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad. With love, Kerri, Mike and Julie.'

Kasem died in a Washington hospital at 3.23am, spokesman Danny Deraney said in a statement.

In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and that his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia.

A judge in May temporarily stripped his wife of her caretaker role after she moved him from a medical facility in Los Angeles to a friend's home in Washington state.

Jean Kasem said she moved her husband to protect his privacy and to consult with doctors. Casey Kasem developed a severe bedsore while in Washington and was in critical condition by the time he was hospitalized in early June.

Kasem's transportation to Washington posed serious risks.

'She disconnected his G-tube, which provided his only source to nutrition and hydration,' Dr. Paul Leitner said in documents obtained by the paper. 'She was informed of the risks of doing so and was told she was placing Mr. Kasem in great bodily harm or possible demise.'

Jean Kasem had objected to a Wednesday ruling in a Los Angeles Superior Court that stopped her husband from being given food and drink over concerns it might be painful for him. 

'Right now, Casey Kasem's health is declining and (he) won't be with us much longer,' Danny Deraney said in a June 6 statement.

During 
temporary conservator Kerri Kasem's visit to see her father on June 1 in
 Washington state, Jean Kasem threw meat at her as he was preparing for a
 trip to the hospital.

'In
 the name of King David, I threw a piece of raw meat into the street in 
exchange for my husband to the wild rabid dogs,' she told NBC News.

Kasem's 'American Top 40' began on July 4, 1970, in Los Angeles, when the No. 1 song was Three Dog Night's cover of Randy Newman's "Mama Told Me Not to Come."

The show expanded to hundreds of stations, including Armed Forces Radio, and continued in varying forms - and for varying syndicators - into the 21st century.

He stepped down from 'American Top 40' in 2004 and retired altogether in 2009, completing his musical journey with Shinedown's 'Second Chance.'

While many DJs convulsed their listeners with stunts and 'morning zoo' snarkiness, Kasem would read 'long distance dedications' of songs sent in by readers and introduce countdown records with sympathetic background anecdotes about the singers.

'The idea from the beginning was to do the type of thing on radio that Ed Sullivan did on television, good, honest stories with human interest,' he told the Los Angeles Times in 1975.

Kasem's legacy reached well beyond music. His voice was heard in TV cartoons such as 'Scooby-Doo' as the voice of Shaggy and in numerous commercials.

'They
 are going to be playing Shaggy and Scooby-Doo for eons and eons,' Kasem
 told The New York Times in 2004.

'And they're going to forget Casey 
Kasem - unless they happen to step on his star on the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame. I'll be one of those guys people say 'Who's that?' about. And 
someone else will say, 'He's just some guy who used to be on the 
radio.''

Succeeding Kasem at the main 'American Top 40' show in 2004 was multi-platform star Ryan Seacrest, who has said he had been a fan of Kasem since boyhood and would imitate him in pretend countdown broadcasts at age 9.

Seacrest mourned Kasem's death in a statement on Sunday.

'It’s a sad day for the broadcasting community and for radio listeners around the world,' he said.

'When I was a kid, I would listen to Casey Kasem’s AT40 show every weekend, and dream about someday becoming a radio DJ. So when decades later I took over his AT40 countdown show, it was a surreal moment.

'Casey had a distinctive friendly on-air voice, and he was just as affable and nice if you had the privilege to be in his company. He’ll be greatly missed by all of us.'

Radio and television personality Carson Daly also offered his condolences.

'Long before MTV and the internet #CaseyKasem made sure you were hearing the best music out there,' Daly wrote on Twitter. 'Peace be to his family and RIP. #Respect.'

The son of Lebanese immigrants, Kasem was active in speaking out for greater understanding of Arab-Americans — both on political issues involving the Mideast and on arts and media issues.

'Arab-Americans are coming out of the closet,' Kasem told The Associated Press in 1990. 'They are more outspoken now than ever before. People are beginning to realize who they really are, that they are not the people who yell and scream on their nightly newscast.'

Kasem was born Kemal Amin Kasem in 1932 in Detroit. He began his broadcasting career in the radio club at Detroit's Northwestern High School and was soon a disc jockey on WJBK radio in Detroit, initially calling himself Kemal Kasem.

In a 1997 visit with high school students in Dearborn, Michigan, home to a large Arab-American community, he was asked why he changed his name to Casey.

'It didn't sound like a deejay; it wasn't hip. So we decided I'd be 'Casey at the Mike' — and I have been since,' Kasem said.

In the 1975 Los Angeles Times interview, he said he had been doing 'a regular screaming DJ show' in San Francisco in the early 1960s when his boss suggested he talk about the records instead.

He was unconvinced, since his screaming routine had brought him top ratings. But he said he had learned 'after a particularly unpleasant situation in Buffalo never to argue with general managers.'
