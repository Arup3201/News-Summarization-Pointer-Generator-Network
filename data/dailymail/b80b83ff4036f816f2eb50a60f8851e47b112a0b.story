Time and tide wait for no man, as the saying goes, especially if they have left their car parked close to a beach.

Teenager Andy Laird discovered this to his embarrassment when he returned from lunch to find his car had been submerged in the sea.

The 19-year-old parked his Vauxhall Corsa on the beach in the popular coastal town of Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, on Saturday afternoon.

Time and tide wait for no man, as the saying goes, especially if they have left their car parked close to a beach as teenager Andy Laird discovered to his embarrassment

The 19-year-old parked his Vauxhall Corsa on the beach in the popular coastal town of Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, on Saturday afternoon

He then walked up to the nearby Brean Down to enjoy a bite to eat and a drink with his family in the scorching temperatures.

But when he returned to the beach at 5pm, he found his car swamped in three feet of water from the incoming tide.

Video footage was taken by local 
rescue charity Burnham Area Rescue Boat (BARB) showing the stranded 
vehicle 50ft (15m) from the shore.

It was eventually rescued an hour later thanks to beach wardens and a team from BARB.

Mr Laird, who lives in Walsall, West 
Midlands, said: 'I was up on the Down enjoying a picnic and forgot about
the tide coming in.

'It was a shock to come back and find the car had been surrounded by the sea.

'I am grateful to BARB and the beach warden for their help.'

Hugh Lewis, 40, who owns a stall on the Burham sea-front said locals were left stunned by the unusual sight.

He said: 'We could see the tide coming in and we just waited for the worst to happen.'

The incident has prompted a warning to visitors to check tide times before driving onto beaches.Â

BARB spokesman Mark Newman said: 'We 
always advise motorists to check the tide times before driving onto our 
local beaches and to heed warning signs and not take unnecessary risks.

'We have a wonderful coastline that can be safely enjoyed by holidaymakers and locals if used sensibly.

Three other motorists had to be 
rescued from beaches in the Burnham-On-Sea area of Somerset on Sunday 
evening as high tides caught them out.

Two
motorists at Brean and one at Berrow were helped by beachwardens and 
Burnham-based rescue charity BARB shortly before high tide.

The vehicles became inundated by the 
incoming sea water shortly before 6pm when their owners misjudged the 
tide and left their cars unattended.

Burnham Coastguards also gave safety advice to the group of people who were seen attempting to push the vehicle from the sea.
