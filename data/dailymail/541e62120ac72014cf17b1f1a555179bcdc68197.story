Shocked: Police are still investigating the mystery shock that killed Christian Lorinczy, 13, after he touched the fence at a middle school football game

A Michigan teen has died after being injured by an electrical shock at a middle school football game, authorities say.

Christian Lorinczy, 13, of Ypsilanti, was playing catch with his friends during a middle school football game at the Ypsilanti Lincoln High School football field at around 8.30pm Tuesday when their football was thrown over a nearby fence,CBS Detroit reports. 

The eighth-grader went to retrieve the ball and was found, by his friends, lying near the fence. 

Authorities say that Lorinczy received an electric shock when he leaned against the fence on a metal ramp leading to the bleachers. 

Michigan Live reports that an off-duty Augusta Township firefighter and a nurse who were in the crowd immediately went to help the boy.

Lorinczy was then rushed to C.S. Mott Children's Hospital where he was listed in critical condition. 

Lincoln Middle School administrators shared the news of Lorinczy's death Friday morning on the Lincoln Consolidated School's website:

'Dear Lincoln Families,

We have some very difficult news to share. As all of you know, Christian Lorinczy, a student at Lincoln Middle School, was involved in a very serious accident on Tuesday night. We had hoped that he would fully recover, but unfortunately, this morning we learned that Christian has passed away... 

Our thoughts are with the Lorinczy family and the entire Lincoln community at this very difficult time.'

After the incident, CBS Detroit reports, the stands were evacuated, the football game was cancelled, and power to the field was shut off. 

Authorities are still investigating what could have caused the fence to deliver an electric shock.

Mystery: The mystery of what could have caused the fence to shock the boy is concerning parents and Ypsilanti community members

Ellen Bonter, superintendent at Lincoln Consolidated Schools, told Michigan live that Lorinczy's incident is the first she's heard of the fence being electrically charged.

However, a Lincoln High School freshman told Michigan Live that numerous students knew the handicap ramp's railing could deliver an electric shock.

A DTE energy spokesperson also told Michigan Live that crews were called to the scene shortly after the incident, but it was determined that the Michigan-based company's equipment was not involved in injuring the boy.  

The mystery of what could have caused the fence to shock the boy is concerning parents and Ypsilanti community members.

Parent Linga McClair expressed in an interview with Detroit Local 4 news her concern for her daughter and nieces who spend a lot of time at the school's football field. 

'It just seems really strange,' McClair said. 'So, it's concerning and so we want to find out why.'
