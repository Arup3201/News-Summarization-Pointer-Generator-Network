The hapless selfie-taking tourist who has become an internet sensation over footage of him being kicked in the head by a Peruvian train driver could be set to earn a substantial fortune from his recent misfortune.

Jared Frank, from Regina, Saskatchewan, has been offered thousands of dollars of advertising and licensing opportunities from media companies keen to take advantage of his hilarious video which has already attracted more than 23 million YouTube views.

On Monday, Frank, 22, signed with a California-based representative called Jukin Media, who has told him his video could earn in the range of $2 to $16 per 1,000 views and he can expect a 70 per cent share of the profits.

Here it comes: Jared Frank, from Regina, Saskatchewan, is set to earn a substantial fortune after his infamous video attracted more than 23 million YouTube views in a week

Precise details wonâ€™t be known until YouTube releases its mid-month report on view tallies, but he could generate as much as $250,000, reports CBC News. There is also a potential for additional revenues from licensing agreements.

'I'm a little worried, but I have a decent relationship with the licensing company, so I trust them,' he said on Monday. 'I did a lot of research first.'

Frank plans to use his earnings to pay for his recent trip to Peru and also to go to film school.

The student was making his way to Macchu Pichu, when the train's engineer taught him a valuable lesson which bruised his ego more than his face.

The student is shown standing beside the tracks just as the train approaches and he meets the business end of the engineer's black leather boot.

'I pressed play and was going to look at where the train was, but by that time, I already got kicked in the head,' he lamented.

The Canadian claimed the drop kick didn't hurt and was more of a shock than anything else.

He doubts that the engineer's intentions was towards helping him avoid more serious injury, or even possible death.

'If the train was going to hit me, it was going to hit me before his boot ever reached me.'

Despite not believing the conductor had good intentions, he did sheepishly admit that the video has made him look foolish.

'Honestly,
 even the truth is a little ridiculous and it does make me look stupid,'
 he said.

'But it was an accident and I got it on film and I think it 
would have been a shame to just throw it away.'

Speaking to the Leader Post, Frank dismissed the online criticism he has received.

'I
 ignore it, they're just faceless people on the internet,' he told the 
paper. 'I never really understood the term 'I love haters' until now. If I wasn't the one in the video, I'd be making those comments too.'

When he uploaded
 the video to YouTube six days ago, Frank attempted to explain that he 'tried to take
 a selfie while a train passed a 'safe' distance behind'. But conceded, 
'I guess I was still too close and got kicked in the head. I messed up'.
