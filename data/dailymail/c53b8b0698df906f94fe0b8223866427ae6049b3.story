As his wife continues to fight for her life in a Georgia ICU, Mark Rinehart is battling his own school board, hoping to use vacation time donated by colleagues so he can spend more time with her.

His wife Hannah, 32 - who has fought cancer twice - has remained at Northside Hospital in Cumming, Georgia, since July 2, after a rare bacterial infection ravaged her body.

To save her life, Mark had to make 
the heartbreaking decision to allow doctors to amputate her hands and 
feet after she suffered circulatory problems and went into septic shock.

Mr Rinehart, a high school teacher and member of the Georgia Army National Guard, knows that when his wife gets out of the hospital, he needs to be there for her day in and day out.

But with just 20 sick days, his fellow teachers stepped up, donating their own time off so he can care for his wife at home, while still collecting a paycheck and health benefits.

But the school district has no policy in place that will allow Mr Rinehart to use the donated days.

Rinehart was joined by friends, family and colleagues at a school board meeting on Thursday night, where he pleaded with Gwinnett County Public Schools to allow for him to use the time off.

According to Snellville Patch, Mrs Rinehart's father, Doug Johnson, told the board: 'As a little girl, [Hannah] would run and jump into my arms and give me a great big hug.

'Unfortunately that little girl no longer has hands or feet. In fact, she is currently fighting for her life in the ICU of Northside hospital.'

District spokeswoman Sloan Roach told CBS Atlanta that allowing Mr Rinehart to use the donated days would change policy, and the district would have to take the its 22,000 employees into consideration.

Fighter: Hannah was more susceptible to the infection as her immune system was weakened by two bouts of cancer - Hodgkin's lymphoma - and subsequent bone marrow transplants

Struck down: She has been in hospital for almost a month after being admitted with a temperature of 103

The school board did not vote on the 
policy change at Friday's meeting, but have said they are working with 
the district's human resources department to see what can be done.

Mr Rinehart said in a blog post on Saturday night that he has not heard any news from the board its decision.

Meanwhile, Hannah Rinehart's recovery is continuing.

Hannah Rinehart became ill after contracting capnocytophaga. It had a significant effect as her immune system had been weakened by cancer and two bone marrow transplants.

The rare infection is only usually a danger to elderly, infirm or those with underlying diseases.

Capnocytophaga is found in the throat of mammals and can be passed to humans through bite wounds.

The bacteria can cause septicemia, meningitis, rare eye infections and endocarditis - an inflammation of the heart.

Symptoms often include fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, confusion, muscle pain or malaise. It can also bring on septic shock.

When discovered, it can be treated with anti-microbial medications.

Doctors believe she contracted capnocytophaga,
an infection usually found in the saliva of dogs. Mr Rinehart said he 
did not know if their one-year-old puppy, Brownie, bit her.

Hannah has beaten cancer twice since the age of 18; she suffered twice from Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was in remission for seven years.

She underwent two bone marrow transplants, which weakened her immune system and made her more susceptible to the bacteria, MyFoxAtlanta reported.

Despite these struggles, her husband, a schoolteacher and national guardsman, said she has always been upbeat.

'You see people around who have had a 
tough time and are bitter about it,' Mr Rinehart told WXIA.

'She's not; she's 
always excited about living. She's a fighter, I married a fighter.

'It's just another stage in our life. I know when she comes out of this she's going to 
be smiling just as big as she was before.'

Another issue affecting the Rinharts is the cost of her care when she is out of the hospital, including prosthetic devices and alterations to their home and vehicles.

A fundraiser that will include an auction and blood drive is scheduled for September 29 at the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Atlanta.

Donations are also being accepted by Operation Appreciation, an outreach organisation dedicated to supporting the members of the Georgia Army National Guard, at www.OperationAppreciation.org.

Mr Rinehart said he has been given support and advice from other families who have also endured quadruple amputations and looks forward to being in touch with more.

'We are loved and supported by so many 
people I can't begin to send thank yous out but I can keep trying,' Mr 
Rinehart, who has been sleeping in the hospital, said.
