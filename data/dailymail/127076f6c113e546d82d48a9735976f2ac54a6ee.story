A woman cleared of causing her elder sister’s death in a car crash has tearfully described how she believed her sibling ‘would not have blamed me’.

Jennie Stone, 28, died after her Peugeot 206 collided with her sister Rosie-Ann’s Vauxhall Astra in February last year. Both had pulled out of a queue to overtake a slow-moving lorry on a road near Bridlington, East Yorkshire. 

Jennie’s car was sent careering across the road into a tree. The mother of one, who was studying at the University of Lincoln to become a social worker, died at the scene.

Now Rosie-Ann, 21, has spoken of her relief at being found not guilty of causing her sister’s death by careless driving – amid criticism of the Crown Prosecution Service for having brought the case at all.

She said that, during her five-day trial at Hull Crown Court last week, she was prepared for a nine-month sentence, but that serving time in jail would not have been as bad as the guilty verdict itself.

‘If I was found guilty, that would have meant Jennie’s death had been my fault. I would not have been able to live with myself,’ she said. ‘I was visualising her as she was when we were growing up together. I was thinking how she looked. How she smelt. Everything about her.’

She added: ‘During the trial, I looked at the jury – every one of them. I felt sorry for them. Some of them looked at me sympathetically. Some looked at me sternly.

‘I had no idea what they were thinking.’

But the jury ruled that Rosie-Ann was not to blame for the accident. She said that, as she left court after the verdict, a juror told her: ‘We all believed you. Live your life. Be happy.’

In the days following the accident, she had constantly apologised to her parents, Angie and Bob, while replaying the tragic events of that day.

‘I was thinking, “What if I had got up earlier that morning?” These are the type of things that were going through my mind.’

Ms Stone said her sister had been her emotional crutch after their brother, 20-year-old soldier Gregg, pictured below, was shot dead in June 2012 while serving in Afghanistan.

She helped her elder sister move to a new house in Bridlington the day before the accident, and  says the family was beginning to recover from Gregg’s death.

‘Life was slowly becoming more bearable for us all,’ she said. ‘I leant on Jennie a lot. She helped me cope with losing Gregg. Then it all fell to pieces again when we lost Jennie.’

The case itself was traumatic for the family, who had begged the CPS not to bring it to court.

Angie Stone, 56, the girls’ mother, wore a moonstone necklace in the shape of a heart, given to her by her dead daughter, to keep her memory alive. 

Mother-of-one Jennie Stone had been studying to become a social worker at the University of Lincoln  at the time of the accident. She was pronounced dead at the scene after her car ploughed into a tree

The accident occured just months after the sisters' brother Private Gregg Stone died in Afghanistan

‘Jennie bought it for me when she was just 16 years old. The day she was killed, I pulled it out of the drawer and I have worn it every  day since. Just because Jennie is not here, it doesn’t  mean she is no longer part of  our family.’

Her husband Bob, also 56, wore his son’s regimental tie with a lapel badge showing a tear on a Union Flag – a symbol worn by parents of fallen soldiers.

Mrs Stone said grief for Gregg was suspended when their daughter died. ‘We began the grieving process for Jennie. But we felt we were betraying Gregg somehow.

‘Then, when the Crown Prosecution Service announced it was prosecuting Rosie-Ann, we stopped grieving altogether.’

Mr Stone told the Hull Daily Mail: ‘Then we had the fight of our lives on our hands. 

‘And we were scared. More scared than we have ever been in our lives.

‘I cannot forgive the CPS for the pain, suffering and distress they put our family through. There have been no winners in this.’

When the verdict was announced, Mr and Mrs Stone stood, weeping, and embraced in the public gallery.

The CPS has released a statement defending the decision to prosecute in the public interest, though Judge Simon Jack said after the verdict he had concerns about the case.
