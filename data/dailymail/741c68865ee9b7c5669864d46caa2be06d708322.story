Hillary Clinton, a probable Democratic presidential candidate, is lending her support to a proposal that would give federal regulators more power over the Internet on the eve of a vote to enact the measure.

Commonly referred to as net neutrality, the measure would also ban Internet 'fast lanes' for some content producers while slowing down data arrival time for others.

Federal regulators plan to approve the set of rules on Thursday, setting up a years-long battle. The 'net neutrality' rules, which seek to guarantee equal access to all online services, are likely to spark fresh challenges in court and efforts in Congress to nullify or revamp the plan.

The latest attempt by the Federal Communications Commission to bring the Internet under its control followed public pressure on the independent agency from President Barack Obama.

Critics of the plan, which FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, has refused to release to the public before the vote, and of the Obama administration, have argued that president overstepped his authority in trying to influence the regulatory agency's activity. 

The FCC, they said, is poised to inappropriately spread its authority to a communications system Congress hasn't given it permission to meddle with.

Republicans in Congress has vowed to investigate the power play, and a GOP member of the commission, Ajit Pai, has warned that the 'secret' plan will give 'a Washington bureaucracy a blank check to decide how Internet service providers deploy and manage their networks from the last mile all the way through to the Internet backbone.'

Clinton on Tuesday said she believed that her former boss, President Obama, was 'right' to get involved.

'For the FCC to do what they want to do, to try to create net neutrality as the norm, they have to have a hook to hang it on,' Clinton said. 'It’s a foot in the door, it’s a value statement, I think the president is right to be upfront and out front on that.'

A former New York senator, Clinton said she would vote for net neutrality if she were in a position to 'because as I understand it, it’s Title II with a lot of changes within it, in order to avoid the worst of the utility regulation.'

Wheeler earlier this month unveiled the plan to regulate broadband Internet service providers as 'public utility' carriers, revamping the agency's rules struck down by a federal court last year.

The rulemaking effort elicited an unprecedented four million comments, with passionate arguments on both sides about the importance of 'freedom' and the need to encourage 'innovation' and investment.

The FCC's five member board will vote on the proposal on Thursday. It is comprised of three Democrats and two Republicans, with the head usually coming the president's party, giving his side more weight even though the agency itself is technically independent.

The Republican commissioners are expected to vote against the net neutrality measures. 

A Democratic commissioner, set to support the plan, had a change of heart this week and is now lobbying Wheeler to weaken the proposal and eliminate a provision that would give the commission authority over 'broadband subscriber access services.'

A fact sheet published by the FCC says the mandate would give it the ability to interfere with policies put worth by Internet providers if the agency believes they are 'not just and reasonable.'

That includes the existence of so-called Internet tolls that slow down the rate at which consumers are able to stream videos on sites like Netflix, which last year accused Comcast of purposefully slowing down the pace at which their subscribers could view content.

If adopted, the 'open Internet' rules would bar 'paid prioritization', blocking of legal content or 'throttling.' Commonly referred to as net neutrality, the measure would ban internet 'fast lanes' for some content producers while slowing down data arrival time for others. Federal regulators plan to vote on the rule change on Thursday

The House or Representatives' Energy and Commerce and Oversight and Government Reform Committees had plans this week to hold hearings on the FCC's plans but abruptly cancelled them on Wednesday after they say Wheeler refused to testify.

'We are deeply disappointed in Chairman Wheeler’s decision,' the committee's chairs, Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, and Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, said in a statement.

'As Chairman Wheeler pushes forward with plans to regulate the Internet, he still refuses to directly answer growing concerns about how the rules were developed, how they are structured, and how they will stand up to judicial scrutiny.

The Republicans chided Wheeler for insisting on 'secrecy' rather than transparency in evaluating the rule change and reminded him that he'll eventually have to appear before the lawmaking body.

'Chairman Wheeler and the FCC are not above Congress. This fight continues as the future of the Internet is at stake,' they wrote.

Meanwhile, net neutrality's backers continued to cheer Wheeler and his allies on the FCC on. 

'This is a big step forward for consumers,' said Chris Lewis at the consumer activist lobby Public Knowledge, which has been pressing for strong net neutrality rules.

Lewis said the rules would ensure 'an Internet where consumers can go anywhere they want,' without seeing services or applications blocked for competitive or financial reasons.

Senator Patrick Leahy also welcomed the effort, saying it will 'ban pay-to-play deals that could strangle innovation from startups and small businesses, creating an Internet divided between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots.''

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, has refused to release to the public before the vote. He's also evading Congress, accoording to two House committee heads. They warned him today that he is not above the legislative branch and will have to report to the lawmaking body at some point

The 'open Internet' rules, which would become final if adopted by the five-member FCC, would bar 'paid prioritization,' blocking of legal content or 'throttling' -- slowing a rival service which competes with one backed by the Internet provider. 

But critics say the Wheeler plan is heavy-handed, based on a 1934 law aimed at regulating phone companies, and claim it will stifle investment and cost consumers more, because broadband firms would not be able to generate revenue through special deals.

Michael Powell, head of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, which represents broadband cable operators, said the FCC was moving toward 'onerous regulation and could well depress investment and innovation.'

Powell said the move opens the door to rate regulation despite Wheeler's claim to steer clear of this.

Former FCC commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth said the agency faces a difficult legal path trying to classify broadband as a public utility without imposing other regulations imposed on telecom firms.

'I don't think the commission has thought this through,' said Furchtgott-Roth, who heads the Hudson Institute's Center for Economics of the Internet.

By selectively imposing regulations, he said, the FCC opens itself up to legal challenges.

And while FCC officials have not released details of the plan, Furchtgott-Roth said the reclassification will likely mean 'billions of dollars in new fees and taxes' which would be imposed either at the federal or state level.

GOP commissioner Ajit Pai tweeted this photo of himself holding the massive set of rules Democrats on the board of the FCC want to slap on internet service providers. Pai, who has seen and read the proposal, said 'the president's plan will lead to less competition and leave Americans with fewer broadband choices'

The FCC move also sparked criticism in the Republican-led Congress, which has the authority to nullify the rules or pass legislation to reverse some of the mandates.

Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte, head of the House Judiciary Committee, said Wheeler 'overestimates the FCC's authority to rewrite our nation's communications laws... and ignores the fact that his net neutrality rules almost certainly will be stuck in courts for years over questions of their legality.' 

The FCC action comes three months after President Barack Obama endorsed a strong net neutrality effort, saying no online service should be forced into a 'slow lane.'

As a result, some Republicans are denouncing the FCC move as 'the Obama plan' and questioning whether the president unduly sought to influence the independent rulemaking agency.

FCC commission member Ajit Pai said in a statement that 'the president's plan will lead to less competition and leave Americans with fewer broadband choices,' describing the effort as an 'approach imposed in Europe' which has led to less private investment.

Some 16,000 websites are endorsing the neutrality effort, in a coalition that includes Tumblr, Mozilla, MediaFire and online review site Yelp.

In a blog post, Yelp said that without FCC enforcement of open access, 'the Internet could fall victim to entrenched, monopolistic ISPs and gatekeeper companies who would control when, how, from whom and at what cost you view content online. This threatens the very core of American freedom and values.'

Twitter public policy manager Will Carty said the FCC rules would guarantee 'the ability for all users to 'innovate without permission'' and 'have important implications for freedom of expression.'
