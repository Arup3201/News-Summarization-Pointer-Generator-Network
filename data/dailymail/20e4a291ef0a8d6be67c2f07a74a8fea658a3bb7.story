A father of four who was sacked over comments he made on Facebook has been awarded more than £30,000 at an employment tribunal.

Alan Blue, 51, worked for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) as a meat hygiene inspector at Wishaw Abattoir in Lanarkshire.

But he lost his job on November 5 last year after he ‘liked’ a posting on the social media site that appeared to encourage violent behaviour towards the manager.

Payout: Alan Blue, who was a meat hygiene inspector for the FSA at Wishaw Abattoir in Lanarkshire, was sacked after making posts on Facebook that his bosses didn't like

Mr Blue said: ‘I was at home watching the telly and went on to Facebook on my phone.

‘I saw one of the guys from the abattoir put on that he was gutted he’d been sacked.

‘I hadn’t heard anything so I replied saying, “Sorry to hear that, hope you find something”. He then said one of the other slaughtermen, Willie, had also been sacked.

‘Then Willie joined in and said something daft that someone had hit one of the managers with his hard hat and I meant to put in “Aye right, u wish” and I hit the “i” button by mistake, so it came up “Aye right, i wish”, which was a genuine typo.

‘I never noticed at the time and the conversation went on and one of the guys said “I should’ve just f****d him over the head with a chair” and I ticked the “like” box.’

Almost two weeks later Mr Blue was approached by his manager who said there’d been a complaint from the abattoir concerning comments on Facebook.

Facebook problems: Mr Blue said the comment was ‘just banter’, adding: ‘As far as I was concerned it was a closed conversation.’

The FSA launched a disciplinary investigation, claiming the posts were a ‘breach of trust’ and ‘not professional’.

However, Mr Blue said the comment was ‘just banter’, adding: ‘As far as I was concerned it was a closed conversation.’

During the tribunal, the FSA claimed there had been a breakdown in trust and confidence between the agency and Mr Blue.

But employment judge Peter Wallington, QC, said: ‘There was no objective reason to believe that his performance would in the future be different simply because of his foolish participation in what he had mistakenly believed to be a private online conversation that had become more public.’

Mr Blue was awarded £32,799.13 for unfair dismissal but he says he has not received any of the money since the June ruling and would rather have his job back.

He added: ‘I regret liking the comment because I never meant to harm anyone.’

An FSA spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed with the tribunal’s conclusions but believe that the decisions managers took were the right ones given the circumstances at the time.’
