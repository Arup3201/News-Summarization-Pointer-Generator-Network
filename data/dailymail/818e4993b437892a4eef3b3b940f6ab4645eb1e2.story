Tyson Fury has been left in the lurch again after Dereck Chisora pulled out of their heavyweight  rematch on Saturday.

Chisora fractured his left hand during his final sparring session ahead of the British and European title clash in  Manchester. It is the third time Fury has seen a domestic fight cancelled after David Haye was twice forced to pull out of a contest last year through injury.

As a result, 25-year-old Fury has only fought once in the past 15 months and has seen his promising career stall.

Previous encounter: Fury won the original bout against Chisora on points back in 2011

Public apology: Chisora has taken to Twitter to tell Fury he is sorry for cancelling the fight

Chisora, 30, beaten by Fury on points in a European title fight in 2011, said: ‘I can’t tell you how disappointed I am to have to pull out of the fight but it is on the advice of my specialist. I’m sorry for the fans but once my hand is healed and I’m given the all-clear to train and punch again, I’ll be working on the new date.  

‘I was in fantastic shape and had a great training camp, probably the best so far in my career, and was looking forward to getting revenge on Fury, but that will have wait.

‘I’m sorry to have to pull out on Fury, as I know that he had been training hard and it was going to be a great fight between two top athletes. I hope we can get it on again soon.’

Fury later tweeted: 'Dereck Chisora is no better than David Haye, a pure s***bag! There is no injury, he dropped his balls.'

Promoter Frank Warren insisted the fight will be rescheduled and that Saturday’s show will still go ahead, with middleweight Billy Joe Saunders’s European title fight with Emanuele Blandamura topping the bill.

Warren said: ‘There’s no way that Dereck could fight with his hand fractured and there’s no way I would let him get into the ring and fight with an injury like that.’
