A celebrity wannabe dubbed the 'vainest man in Britain' claims to have been punched in a nightclub for being a Joey Essex imitator.

Sam Barton, 22, from Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, suffered a bruised lip after allegedly being attacked in a nightclub in Romford, Greater London, on Friday night.

During the altercation, the suspect allegedly shouted: 'You will need a new nose job before I have finished with you' in reference to Mr Barton's £5,000 nose job which he got done for free on the NHS earlier this year.

Mr Barton, who is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton, said: 'It started in the queue when four lads and girls started verbally assaulting me. 

'They said there was only one thing worse than Joey Essex and that was a Joey Essex wannabe.

'They pursued me for over an hour in the club before another lad joined them and said: "You will need a new nose job before I have finished with you" - and then he hit me.

'Fortunately, he didn't hit my nose. He just left me with a cut lip but it was still a very nasty shock.'

Mr Barton, who claims to be best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee, has been clubbing in Essex on a number of occasions with friends who live in the county.

However, the celebrity lifestyle seeker said it was the first time he had been out since revealing he was set to apply for free Botox and another nose job on the NHS.

Earlier this year, Mr Barton had a nose job on the NHS and last month he told doctors he needed more free cosmetic treatment to help combat symptoms of sweating caused by anxiety due to his 'new-found fame'

The celebrity lifestyle seeker referred to the incident to his 23,000 followers on Twitter over the weekend

He added: 'I will visit my friend again in Essex but I won't be going out again at night there.

'I have never had any problem on nights out in Birmingham. Everyone is really friendly to me here.

'I realise I am controversial and perhaps rub some people up the wrong way but there is no need to verbally or physically assault me.'

Last month, Mr Barton told doctors he needed further free cosmetic treatment to combat symptoms of sweating caused by anxiety due to his 'new-found fame'. He is expected to meet with medics for a consultation later this month.

If he is given the go-ahead from the NHS, the Botox treatment will cost around £3,000 per year for six injections every two months.

Mr Barton had the £5,000 nose job on the NHS (left) to look like 'the perfect man' and now hopes to receive more free cosmetic surgery, including a £3,000-a-year Botox treatment plan, to 'help combat a sweat problem'

Mr Barton, who works part-time in a bar and a supermarket, previously revealed he had spent £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man'.

But he has amassed hefty credit card debts of £25,000 in just four years in search of the glamorous Joey Essex look he hopes will make him a star.

He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment.

He has also had a nose job and a procedure to straighten his nose, together worth £10,400, although one was done for free on the NHS.
