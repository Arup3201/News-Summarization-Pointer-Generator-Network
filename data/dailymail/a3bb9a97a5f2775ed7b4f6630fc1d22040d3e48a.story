A 4-year-old boy died Wednesday morning after falling into an empty bath while being watched by a babysitter in a Times Square luxury high-rise.

Police responded to a 911 call at The Ritz Plaza apartment building at 235 West 48th Street and found the boy unconscious and unresponsive.

According to his 37-year-old babysitter, she had set the boy on a ledge in the bathroom of the eleventh floor apartment before leaving the room momentarily.

Too young: Police responding to a 911 call at The Ritz Plaza apartment building in New York's Times Square found a 4-year-old boy unconscious and unresponsive. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital

While she was gone she heard a loud noise, ran back into the bathroom and found the boy had fallen into the empty bathtub.

Paramedics rushed the boy to St Luke's Hospital on Roosevelt Island where he was pronounced dead.

Police sources told NBC New York that the boy had been found with cuts and burns on his face, burns on his genitals, as well as yellow foam around his mouth. Some of the burns were from cigarettes and the babysitter couldn't account for any of the injuries.

She said the boy's 37-year-old father had placed him in her care on December 18 before being arrested on a warrant in New Jersey. He is still incarcerated.

It was not immediately clear where the mother was, but according to the New York Daily News, she had lost custody. 

As of late Wednesday, the babysitter was still being questioned by police.

The medical examiner is expected to conduct an autopsy Thursday morning, and charges will be filed after that.

However, as the New York Times points out, these investigations can take a while. Charges have yet to be filed in the suspicious death of a Mexican consular official's 4-month-old son on December 10 after an autopsy proved inconclusive.

The Administration of Children's Services is also investigating, and isn't allowed to divulge whether the family has a record.

Sources told NBC New York that the babysitter doesn't have a history of child abuse or neglect.

The child's death came as a surprise for tenants in the 40-story luxury tower.

'I have a baby too...that's scary,' a woman pushing a stroller outside the building told the Daily News.
