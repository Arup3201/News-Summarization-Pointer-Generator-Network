In many families, music can be a calming force which brings people together.

But at home with Danny Fleming, the proud owner of more than 100 sets of bagpipes, his hobby has a less harmonious effect.

The Scottish police officer has 40 years of piping experience under his belt, and, unluckily for his wife and nine-year-old son, is as enthusiastic as ever.

Enthusiast: Danny Fleming, 50, has amassed 105 sets of bagpipes, believed to be the world's largest collection

At home: Mr Fleming's wife, Jane, has admitted that she would rather her husband were less of a bagpipe fanatic

Mr Fleming, originally of Arbroath on the eastern coast of Scotland, took up the bagpipes aged ten and racked up plenty of experience by serving in the Scots Guards for 24 years.

The police officer now plays in Humebrside Police's pipe band, and has established himself as a bagpipe connoisseur with his 105-strong collection.

Although the Guinness Book of World Records currently has no entry for the world's biggest bagpipe collection, it is not believed that Mr Fleming's collection has been outdone, and there are plans for him to be recognised in a future edition.

His vast, £130,000 collection features models which date from as long ago as 1918, and includes a set of pipes set in gold, silver and ivory worth more than £12,000.

All of his pipes also get a good hearing, as Mr Fleming makes sure to swap his current set every few weeks, and undertakes the mammoth task of cleaning his entire collection every three months.

Long-suffering: The couple said they have 'understanding neighbours'

Proud tradition: Mr Fleming's son Logan, nine, has yet to take up the passion of his father, who was only ten years old when he started playing

Resigned: Mrs Fleming said she 'knew what she was getting into' when she married her husband

Mr Fleming's wife Jan, 41, and 
nine-year-old son, Logan, are not great fans of bagpipe music, but have 
learned to live with his eccentricity.

Mrs Fleming said:  'It is absolutely ridiculous the amount of bagpipes Danny has. He can only play one set at once.

'But I knew when I married him that he came with the bagpipes - I knew what I was getting into.

'We’re lucky we’ve got very understanding neighbours.'

Military man: Police officer Mr Fleming used to be a member of the Scots Guards, and even visited the pyramids of Egypt in full regalia, right

Local character: Mr Fleming says he is known as a bagpipe enthusiast in the local community

Dedicated: Mr Fleming has dedicated 40 years of his life to bagpiping

The keen piper, who uses his talent to raise money for Macmillan, Help for Heroes and St Andrews Hospice by playing in charity events, also brought relief to his family by finding a more permanent outlet for his enthusiasm by joining Humberside Police's pipe band.

He said: 'Since joining the police band I play at home a lot less, which I think my wife appreciates.

'Jane would relish the thought of me selling them all, but there’s no chance of that happening. I’m too attached to them.'

Life's work: Mr Fleming says there is 'no chance' of him ditching the collection, and that whenevr he sells a set of bagpipes he regrets it

Mr Fleming said he became inspired by broadcasts of military processions her watched as a child.

He said: 'I saw Trooping the Colour on the television when I was a kid and thought the bagpipes were amazing.

'I started playing for the local band and after six months my dad bought me my first set.

'I have loved and collected bagpipes ever since.

'As a collector and a musician I am always searching for that very special instrument which has an even better sound.

Expensive kit: Mr Fleming has spent around £130,000 on his collection, including a single set of pipes, right, which is worth £12,000

'Some of my bagpipes I bought new and some are very old, my oldest set are from 1918 and therefore very rare.

'I swap pipes every few weeks, so I get to enjoy playing all of my collection.

'Although they’re all the same size 
they all vary in ornamentation and quality of sound, I even have a set 
made from plastic rather than wood.

'My most valuable set of bagpipes is 
worth over £12,000, it is set in gold and silver with ancient ivory. It 
has regimental battle honours engraved and the clan crest.

'I have sold some bagpipes in the past, and I always regret it.'

Danny said: 'In the local community people get to hear about things like this, I have become the bagpipe guy and if somebody is selling some, I’m usually the first to hear about it.'
