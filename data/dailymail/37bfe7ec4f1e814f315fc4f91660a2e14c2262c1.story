Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes said the police were guilty of an 'unforgivable' and a 'completely unacceptable failure' by not probing the full extent of News of the World payments to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.

Speaking at the Leveson Inquiry this morning, the deputy Lib Dem leader said the 2006 police investigation failed to look into whether it was 'appropriate to bring charges against other people' despite evidence that 'at least three' other senior News of the World journalists were involved in hacking his phone.

The MP, outed by the Sun after the paper said it had proof he used a gay chat line, settled his phone-hacking claim with News International for £45,000 earlier this month.

He
was named as a hacking victim in the 2007 trial of News of the World 
royal editor Clive Goodman and Mulcaire, who were both jailed after 
admitting to intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides' phones.

Mr Hughes told the inquiry: 'It struck me as fairly obvious once 
everything was revealed if you had seen the names of the other 
journalists from the same paper (in Muclaire's files) you would at least have asked some 
questions and got them in for questioning and investigate what their 
role was.

'You would also have pursued Mr Mulcaire and potentially other 
people and ask them what his relationship was with the other people.'

Mr Hughes said now the police have 'opened the box' six years later it should 'complete the task fully'.

He said: 'If there had been robust 
action in 2006 a lot of the illegal action might have been shut down and
a lot of the people who are now known to be victims might not be 
victims or might not have suffered as much.'

Mr Justice Leveson said there are several witnesses whose lives had been 'dramatically affected' by that delay.

Mr Hughes went on: 'I am 
frustrated even now that there wasn't comprehensive action taken then, 
that was the window of opportunity, a lot of pain and grief could have 
been spared.

'Police ... could have prosecuted those who were clearly in 
the frame ... We lost three or four years in which illegal activity 
continued.'

Mr Hughes said he did not know until May last year exactly what information was contained in Mulcaire's notebooks.

He said it included transcripts, friends' names and phone numbers, addresses, call data, and names of people he had not heard of.

Mr Hughes said: 'It was clear from September 2006 at the highest level the News of the World knew about this and therefore it was in the public interest that the News of the World and their employees should be held to account.'

He added: 'There was a whole range of people clearly acting in concert either directly or indirectly illegally and they were not touched. I find it impossible to find a good explanation for why that happened.'

Mr Hughes told the inquiry he had some concerns about his voicemails back in 2005 and 2006 after messages that he had not listened to were marked as 'read'.

He said he later received a call from the Sun newspaper who wanted to talk to him about a 'private matter'.

He admitted to the newspaper he had made calls to a gay chat line and gave an interview to the which was published in January 2006.

Mr Hughes told the inquiry that he went from 'odds on 
favourite' to take the Lib Dem leadership from Charles Kennedy to not winning following the coverage.

Mr Hughes said: 'There was
apparently a direct impact between that revelation and the consequent 
press coverage and my political reputation and chance of winning the 
election.'

Later on today the inquiry will hear from Crimewatch presenter and former police officer Jacqui Hames, retired teacher Christopher Jefferies, who was wrongly arrested during the Joanna Yeates murder investigation, and Guardian journalist Nick Davies.
