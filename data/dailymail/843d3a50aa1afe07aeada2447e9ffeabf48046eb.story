In the final tense days before the election, both presidential candidates have been pulling out all the stops in their bids for the White House.

Over in the Republican camp, nominee Mitt Romney has been surrounded by his adult sons, their wives and grandchildren. The children of his running mate Paul Ryan appear to be delighted by all the excitement, hamming it up for the cameras in campaign hats and T-shirts.

By comparison, Barack Obama's 14-year-old daughter Malia and Sasha, 11, have hardly been seen at all on the campaign trail in 2012 compared to four years ago. 

The girls were last seen in public on October 28 as they attended church in Washington D.C. with their father and godmother Kaye Wilson.

Last outing: The Obama girls were last in the public eye when they attended church with their father on October 28 in Washington D.C.

The girls appeared at the Democratic National Convention on September 6 in North Carolina, where they waved from the stage as their father accepted the presidential nomination.

However, the girls' public appearances seem to have been kept to a minimum. They did not appear at the presidential debates - unlike many of Romney's grandchildren.

In contrast, Romney is almost constantly accompanied by members of his large family, including his wife of 42 years Ann, his five sons and their wives and many of his 18 grandchildren, who are often photographed on his campaign jet.

Republican Vice President nominee Paul Ryan has also had his children along for the ride in the last days of the campaign.

His ten-year-old daughter Liza, who is close in age to Sasha Obama, has been pictured striking a number of comic poses while her father appears at events in swing states.

His son Charlie, eight, appears shy while the youngest, seven-year-old Sam, often steals the show with a beaming grin for the waiting press.

The trio appear to be enjoying the 
shift from their lives in small town Janesville, Wisconsin, to 
motorcades across the country, posing in Romney-Ryan hats and t-shirts 
and attending football games.

While
 Michelle Obama is a seasoned and prolific campaigner for her husband's 
cause, Malia and Sasha have been kept out of the public eye by their 
parents.

At the 
presidential debates, Michelle Obama supported her husband from the 
audience with members of his campaign team  - but without their girls. The Romney camp were pictured in the audience and following the debate with their grandchildren as they met the Obamas. 

Barack has spoken about his worries over his daughters as they grow up in the public eye. He told MTV last month that he was concerned about Malia going on Facebook because she was so well-known.

Obama said: 'I'm very keen on protecting
 her privacy. She can make her own decisions as she gets older, but 
right now, for security reasons, she does not have a Facebook page.'

In 2008, Obama's two daughters were by his side during a lot of the campaign, wearing T-shirts and being involved in events like packing boxes for overseas troops.

He drew criticism when he allowed his daughters to be interviewed by Access Hollywood four years ago. Malia and Sasha, ten and seven at the time, spoke on camera, in an interview which was then splashed across the TV networks.

When asked about the decision, Obama said he was surprised by the attention the interview had garnered before adding: 'We wouldn’t do it again and we won’t be doing it again.'

Although their father could be attempting to shield his daughters from the viciousness of the presidential campaign, there could also be one simple answer - both Malia and Sasha are mid-way through term at the private Sidwell Friends School they attend in D.C.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the White House.
