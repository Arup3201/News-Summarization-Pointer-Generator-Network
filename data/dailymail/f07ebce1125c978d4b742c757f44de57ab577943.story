A woman whose body was pulled from a canal died in strikingly similar circumstances to her boyfriend's room-mate, it emerged today.

Sarah Majoras, 39, was last seen in the early hours of Saturday leaving the same New Jersey bar as tragic musician David Anderson did 12 years ago before he was also found dead in a canal close to the frozen Delaware & Raritan Canal in 
Lambertville.

Anderson had left John and Peter's Bar in 
New Hope before heading to the home he shared with room-mate Adam Baker, who
is Majoras' boyfriend.

Macabre discovery: A body pulled from a canal in New Jersey is thought to be that of missing bartender Sarah Majoras (pictured), who disappeared after walking home alone in the early hours of last Saturday

Fearing the worst: Prosecutors said the body matches the 39-year-old's description, but say formal identification had yet to take place

Authorities reportedly found Anderson's body in the nearby canal three days later. His death was ruled as accidental.

Prosecutors said the latest body, which was 
found in the same stretch of water where the friend died 12 years ago, 
matches Majoras' description, but said formal identification had yet to take 
place.

The discovery came after a boot thought to belong to Majoras was found in the canal and shortly after prosecutor Anthony Kearns made a renewed appeal for information about her disappearance.

Kearns said they were investigating reports Majoras had been approached by a man hours before she was last seen.

Clue? Prosecutors said they were investigating reports Majoras had been approached by a man hours before she was last seen

Although he said foul play could have 
been a factor in her death, he said there was no evidence of such as 
yet, it was reported onÂ www.lehighvalleylive.com.

Local residents who recalled both incidents said that they, too, believed Baker's connection was simply a tragic coincidence and not something untoward, Philly.com reported.

'Everybody around here knows it's not a possibility,' said Joe Ujj, a community member helping to coordinate volunteer search efforts for Majoras.

'I work with Adam and have known him since high school. It's not that type of thing. I don't know how else to say it.'

Messages of condolence have already 
started pouring into the 'Find Sarah Majoras' Facebook page in a sign 
that her friends and loved ones are braced for the worst.

Kearns said her family were 'saddened and heartbroken'.

Workplace: Majoras was last seen after leaving John & Peter's Bar (above), where she had been drinking and listening to music with friends on a night off

Marjoras was last seen on 
surveillance video at about 2am on Saturday crossing into the city from 
New Hope, where she had worked at John & Peter's Bar for 15 years.

Cameras show her turning north onto Lambert Lane and walking toward her home in the 100 block of North Union Street.

She was not working on Friday night, but had been drinking and listening to music with friends.

Her boyfriend Adam Baker called the bar when she did not return home and she was reported missing at around 2pm on Saturday.

Short journey: Miss Majoras was believed to have been walking the one-mile route to her home in the early hours of Saturday when she vanished

Specialist divers have been searching 
the canal every day since her disappearance and a police helicopter has 
also been assisting in the search.

John & Peter's nightclub has also put up her missing poster on their website.

Majoras is described as 5ft 4ins and weighing 140lb.

She has blue eyes, blonde hair and was last seen wearing blue jeans, brown leather boots, white cap and a camouflage jacket.
