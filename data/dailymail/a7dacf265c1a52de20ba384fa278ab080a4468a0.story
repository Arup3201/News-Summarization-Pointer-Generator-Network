A British peer whose son died from a blow to the head while in Kenyan police custody has demanded a full Scotland Yard investigation.

Lord Monson spoke out on the second anniversary of the death of his son Alexander, who was arrested in the coastal town of Diani on suspicion of smoking cannabis and was later found unconscious in the police station.

The Kenyan police said Alexander died as the result of using drugs, but pathologists found a massive blood clot on his brain caused by a blow to his head, as well as bruising to his arm and groin.

Lord Monson said the senior arresting officer, Corporal Naftali Chege, 48, never faced thorough questioning, and that a local inquiry was cursory.

The peer’s MP, former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, has now written to the Foreign Office demanding that it formally ask the Kenyan government to allow Scotland Yard detectives to question the officers involved.

Lord Monson said: ‘In my view there has been a cover-up, but Scotland Yard cannot investigate without the approval of the Kenyan government.

‘Not a day goes by when I don’t remember my son.’
