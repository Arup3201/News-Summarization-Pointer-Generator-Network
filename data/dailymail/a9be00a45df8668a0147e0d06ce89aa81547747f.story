A woman rugby star who took up the sport after being teased by bullies for being ugly has had the last laugh after being crowned a beauty queen.

Amy Brown, 21, suffered cruel taunts during her school years because she achieved good grades and wore boy's clothes.

Amy, from the Forest of Dean, learned to cope with her tormentors after taking up rugby when she was 12 and played at least twice a week for her local club.

Amy Brown suffered years of bullying but now the rugby star has been crowned a beauty queen

Amy was crowned Miss Forest of Dean earlier this year after friends suggest she enter 

Last month her friends suggested she enter a local beauty pageant and two weeks ago she was crowned Miss Forest of Dean.

Amy, who stands 5ft 8ins tall, will swap her muddy boots for high heels when she competes in the semi-finals of Miss England in June.

Amy, who is studying Criminology at the University of Gloucester, says she never imagined that she would take so well to pageanting. 

Amy began playing rugby when she was 12-years-old 

'I never expected to come this far. I've never been into high heels and dresses.

'For me, it was always rugby and drinking with the lads in the bar afterwards. The closest I ever had to having a picture taken was doing a selfie.'

Amy says that after years of being told how unattractive she was she never thought she would go on to win a contest.  

Before winning Miss Forest of Dean, Amy had never entered a beauty pageant before 

'I never ever thought of myself as being particularly glam. Before I got into rugby I was bullied at school.

'I wasn't very popular and worked hard so the bullies called me "boffin" and "ugly". Even in my teens I didn't wear makeup and played rugby to deal with the name calling.'

Amy says that rugby helped to act as a release for all of her pent up anger towards her bullies.  

'It was a way I could get my frustration out but I really enjoy it. I'm in the second row so I'm in the thick of the action.

'I always get stuck in and I've got knocked out twice. I haven't got any cauliflower ears thankfully.'

Amy, who has a long-term boyfriend, gym instructor Ben Jones, 22, has beaten thousands of hopefuls to reach the semi-finals of Miss England.

Before winning Amy had no experience in beauty contests but says that she loves getting dolled up now. 

'I never thought I'd make it to the semi-finals of Miss England. It's been an amazing journey.

'Before the competition I'd never been on a catwalk. The first time I put on high heels I tottered about and almost lost my balance so I've had to practice loads.

'It's a great feeling to get glammed up now, especially when I think back to the abuse I got from the bullies. I do feel like I've had the last laugh.' 

Amy says that playing rugby was a way of releasing all of her pent up frustration towards her bullies
