As a 3-month-old girl with a brain tumor battles for her life, an unexpected outpouring of support has come to the Oklahoma newborn from all over America.

As her parents Michelle and Steve Dunn have shared their unthinkable struggle on social media like Twitter and Facebook, the internet has responded in kind with a dedicated hashtag, Facebook pages, and widespread fundraising that has so far raised thousands for the Dunns.

Now, as Tatum awaits surgery that could save her life, people who’ve never met the little girl or her family are praying for her recovery.

The nightmare began when the Dunns noticed their newborn’s head was swelling.

Doctors ran tests that brought terrifying results: Tatum had a tumor.

The family traveled to Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where doctors told them Friday that Tatum likely has desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, a rare type of brain tumor.

The tumors most often occur in the first two years of life and are most commonly, though not always, benign.

Terrifying: The Dunns' struggle began when they noticed Tatum's head was swelling. Last week, doctors at Memphis's Le Bonheur hospital confirmed her tumor

Surgery was slated for August 6. It was around this time when the remarkable shows of support began.

Family and friends sent their well-wishes and donations to the struggling family as they waited, away from home, in Tennessee.

Prior to the scary diagnosis, Steven Dunn first used the Twitter hashtag #pray4Tatum on Thursday. Tatum has since gotten her own Twitter account, Pray for Tatum.

The hashtag grew quickly. Thanks to Steve’s position as a high school football coach and recruiting coordinator, coaches from 22 states across the country have since tweeted and retweeted in support of the ailing little girl.

‘When you're a coach, you know you're a part of something special, something bigger than yourself,’ Steve’s brother, also a high school football coach, told The Oklahoman.

Hopeful: Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma most often occurs in the first year or two of life and is usually, though not always, benign and highly responsive to surgery

Still waiting: Tatum was scheduled for surgery Tuesday, just days after her diagnosis. However, complications with her blood transfusion forced surgeons to reschedule for Thursday

At Broken Arrow High School, where Steve coaches football in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, the cheerleading squad and football team raised $2,200 for the Dunns with a car wash.

When Tuesday finally came, the thousands who had tweeted, posted, and donated over just a few days were waited for the news.

And it came: Due to some complications with the blood transfusion, Tatum’s surgery was rescheduled for Thursday.

Widespread: Support showed outside the internet, too. This sign sits out front of the pharmacy where Michelle Dunn works in Oklahoma

Now droves of supporters must wait, though certainly not with the level of fear and uncertainty Tatum’s family must be feeling.

Michelle Dunn posted to her daughter’s Facebook Tuesday:

‘Thank you all for rallying behind us, but today was not the day. Had trouble during transfusion with IV access & time constraints would not have allowed her to go into surgery stable. New plan is 7am Thursday. As let down & exhausted as we are, it's not about us but what is best for Tatum. All in His timing.’

Waiting: Now, as Michelle and Steve await the pushed back surgery date, people across the internet and all over America wait with bated breath, too
