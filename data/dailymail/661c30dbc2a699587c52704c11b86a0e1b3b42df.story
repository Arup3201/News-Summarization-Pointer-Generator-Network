It's not unusual for traffic wardens to be on the receiving end of abuse from the public as they dish out parking tickets and clamp poorly-parked cars.

But when traffic stopped for a row in Tangshan, China, it was because it was between two traffic wardens.

The female officers were caught on camera as they fought on the job while they were supposed to be directing traffic during rush hour.

Bad day at the office? A fight breaks out between two female traffic officers in Tangshan, China

Giving as good as she got: One of the women pushes her colleague towards the ground as cars drive around the scene of the fight

Code of conduct: Instead of protecting pedestrians from lanes of busy traffic, the women are in a world of their own

Standing on a pedestrian crossing in the middle of a busy road, the officers grappled with each other for over a minute.

The pair hit and punched each other in the head and face, knocking off their white caps and ignoring the cars that honked as they drove past.

They are stopped by another female officer, who leaves her post across the road, marches over to the pair and grabs them by the arms.

As she reprimands them, the officers continue to grab each others' hair.

Vicious: The women slapped each other and threw punches. They were fired the next day because of their unprofessional behaviour

Break it up! Another officer intervenes to separate the women, who squirm under her grip

Dressing down: The women are reprimanded by their colleague, who wears the same white and navy outfit. She left her post directing traffic to resolve the fight

Calm after the storm: An officer in a navy uniform gives the women a stern telling off

According to Shanghai Daily News, the traffic police assistants were hired to help police direct the traffic and are not full time employees.

Assistant officers are used on the busy roads of China's major cities, which are prone to congestion.

The dispute, which turned into a street brawl, broke out just before 9am on July 8.

Local police told Shanghai Daily News that the women were fired following the fight.
