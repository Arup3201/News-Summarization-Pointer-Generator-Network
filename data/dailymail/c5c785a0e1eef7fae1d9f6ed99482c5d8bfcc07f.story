Hoping to head off a premature strike on Iran, President Obama sought to assure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday that America would ‘always have Israel’s back’.

The two leaders put on a show of unity before key talks at the White House on Monday.

The day after Mr Obama warned of ‘loose talk of war’ with Iran, he insisted there was still time for diplomacy to prevent the rogue regime from obtaining nuclear weapons.

In agreement: Both leaders affirmed their support for each others' countries; Mr Obama and Mr Netanyahu will meet in private to further discuss issues of Iran

Should America support Israel if it launches missile strikes on Iran?

If push came to shove, he said the U.S. would back Israel.

‘The bond between our two counties is unbreakable,’ he added.

But in one of the most consequential meetings between U.S. and Israeli leaders in years, Mr Obama appealed to allow more time for ‘crippling’ sanctions against Iran to work.

‘We believe there is still a window that allows for a diplomatic resolution,’ he said.

Sitting side by side and smiling at each other in the Oval Office, both leaders made a clear attempt to put the personal antipathy that has marked some of their previous meetings behind them.

But the more hawkish Mr Netanyahu made it plain that Israel would still be the ‘master of its fate’ in deciding how to deal with Tehran, which has called for the destruction of the Jewish state.

No games: Mr Obama said Sunday that 'loose talk' of war was only benefiting Iran

In talks: The talks between the leaders were genial and pleasant; they have publicly clashed in the past

‘Israel has a sovereign right to make its
 own decisions. It must have the ability to defend itself, by itself, 
against any threat,’ he added.

After weeks of mounting concern that 
Israel could pre-emptively attack Iran on its own, the two men were 
careful to present a united front.

'The bond between our two countries is unbreakable.'

-President Obama

Acknowledging there could be some ‘difficult months ahead’, Mr Obama underlined his earlier assurance that the US reserved ‘all options’ in dealing with Iran. He has made it clear that could include military action.

‘We do not want to see a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world,' he said.

‘We do not want the possibility of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terrorists. And we do not want a regime that has been a state sponsor of terrorism being able to feel that it can act even more aggressively or with impunity as a consequence of its nuclear power,’ he added.

Lots to discuss: The Prime Minister and the President spoke for nearly three hours on Monday in the White House

‘The agency continues to have serious 
concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear 
program,’ said International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano.

Recent moves to boost uranium 
enrichment at Fordo, an underground Iranian facility that may be able to
 withstand aerial attack, are of particular concern.

Though
 Mr Obama was overwhelmingly supported by Jewish voters in the 2008 
election, his campaign has noticed a sharp decrease of support as the 
president continues his term.

Last
 September, a majority of people taking part in the Public Policy Poll 
said Israel was ‘very important’ in determining their vote. However, 
only 22 per cent of Jewish voters said they agreed with Mr Obama’s 
stance on Israel, the Wall Street Journal noted.

Many pundits say the Jewish vote will be crucial to Mr Obama’s re-election this November.

‘As Iran is not providing the 
necessary cooperation, the agency is unable to provide credible 
assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and 
activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material 
in Iran is in peaceful activities,’ Mr Amano added.

In his speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Sunday, Mr Obama reiterated his belief that sanctions against Iran were taking effect.

‘Now is not the time for bluster,’ he said. ‘Now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in.’

The President framed military force as a last resort, not the next option at a time when sanctions are squeezing Iran.

He said just the talk of war has driven up the price of oil to the benefit of Iran.

The president and the prime minister 
have been on openly rocky terms since Mr Obama took office. At least 
year’s G20 summit in Cannes, Mr Obama and French president Nicolas 
Sarkozy exchanged candid words in a backroom that were picked up by 
others’ microphones.

Mr Sarkozy was heard calling Mr Netanyahu ‘a liar’ and said: ‘I can’t bear Netanyahu.’

To which, Mr Obama replied: ‘You’re fed up, but I have to deal with him every day.’

Though
 the exchange was hardly surprising, both leaders displayed earnestness,
 if not willingness, to move past their tumultuous relationship today.
