LeVar Burton's fundraising effort to bring Reading Rainbow to the online masses is a by-the-book success - and he can barely contain his excitement.

The beloved TV host launched a Kickstarter on Wednesday to bring the popular children's book series online, stating he needed $1 million by July 2 to launch the project.

But within hours, he achieved his target, with more than 23,000 donors pledging their support.

This means Burton and his team can share Reading Rainbow's extensive collection of digital books and videos with classrooms around the country for a low fee.

'I am overwhelmed. Thank you so much. This is going to enable us to really, really, really do a lot of good,' Burton, who hosted the adored reading program from the early 1980s until recently, said.

'I am so proud that this community 
has come together to support this effort. It's the people's thing. It's 
the five, it's the 10, is the 25, it's the $1 pledges,' he added, crying.

'It's
 unbelievable. Or, it's actually very believable. Thank you so much, we 
are literally changing the world one children's book at a time.'

Now, more than 48,000 backers have pledged over $1.9 million to the project.

'It was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could 'go anywhere' and 'be anything',' Burton said in a posting on Kickstarter.

Contributors can claim rewards ranging from autographed memorabilia to a private dinner with Burton to a chance to put on the visor that the actor wore on Star Trek: The Next Generation.

'We're not just getting pledges, but so much email love that our server froze,' said Mark Wolfe, Burton's business partner.

'I'm so happy to help. LeVar taught me to read,' is among the typical messages, he said.

Origins: Reading Rainbow began in 1983, using television to bring books to kids

A tablet version of Reading Rainbow was released in 2012 and became a top-selling education app.

It provides access to hundreds of books and Burton's videotaped 'field trips' to historic and other places, said Wolfe, who co-founded the for-profit RRKidz company with Burton.

The Kickstarter campaign is intended to help bring an online version to more children for a $5 monthly subscription fee, Wolfe said. Many more families have access to computers than tablets, he said.

An educator-specific format will be created for schools and made available free to at least 1,500 of the neediest classrooms, RRKidz said.

Burton and Wolfe hold the global rights to Reading Rainbow in partnership with the show's creator, public TV station WNED in Buffalo, New York, according to a release.
