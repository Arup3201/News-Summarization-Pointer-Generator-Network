Murder convict John Massey, who escaped from Pentonville Prison on Wednesday, was arrested today in Faversham, Kent

A convicted murderer who was on the run for 48 hours has been arrested in a house near his dying mother's care home.

John Massey, 64, accomplished his most
dramatic break-out two days ago using a makeshift rope to scale the walls of the 
Victorian-built jail Pentonville prison in north London on Wednesday evening.

But after two days in hiding, Scotland Yard said Massey was arrested in Faversham, Kent on Friday not far from his 86-year-old mother May's care home.

Neighbours reported several police vehicles and armed police officers surrounding the Victorian two-bedroom cottage around 5pm on Friday afternoon.

After a quick swoop two men were brought out of the house and taken away in the cars.

One of them said: ‘I realised there were several armed police officers in my back garden and I could see them in other gardens as well.

‘They must have thought Massey would try to escape out the back of the house. There were also two officers with guns in an alleyway around the side of the house.

‘I don't think they put up a struggle because it was all over quickly.’

Local sources said Messenger, known as Harry, has served time in prison for smuggling offences.

One source said: ‘Harry's friends are shocked to hear about this because
they thought he was looking to lead a more settled life now he's 
getting on a bit.

Another neighbour, a woman who did 
not want to be named, added: ‘I saw a big black four-wheel drive vehicle
outside and five men wearing plain clothes jumped out of it and went 
inside the house.

‘Then I saw one man being escorted out of the house and put in the car.’

An occupant of that house - said to be
a 70-year-old man named Henry Messenger - was arrested on suspicion of 
aiding and abetting Massey's escape.

Daring: Massey climbed over a wall at Pentonville Prison using a makeshift rope

Pentonville Prison has held some notorious inmates down the years.

The jail houses Category B and C prisoners - and not the most serious Category A cases.

Oscar Wilde spent time inside Pentonville before being transferred to Wandsworth in the late 19th century.

More recently, Pete Doherty (below) spent six weeks inside for possessing cocaine last year, while Boy George and George Michael have also been held there.

In 2008, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouse's then husband, was jailed at Pentonville for causing grievous bodily harm.

The prison, in Islington, north London, holds up to 1,250 inmates and has been used since 1842.

Convicted arsonist Julien Chautard escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of the security van he arrived in three years ago.

Both of Massey’s previous escapes were
to see ailing family members

Friends of his family said he had 
learned only a few days ago that May, who has Alzheimer’s 
disease, had been calling out his name at a care home in Kent.

A friend of his mother 
said: ‘May is getting very old now, she is in her eighties, and she has a
touch of Alzheimer’s. She has been crying lately and asking for John.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'John
Massey has this afternoon, Friday June 29, been arrested by detectives 
from the Metropolitan Police Service specialist crime and operations 
command.

'He has been taken into custody at a north London police station.'

Massey was found following an intelligence-led operation, the spokesman said.

A second male was arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting an absconder and was also taken into police custody.

The Prison Service is investigating how Massey managed to elude staff.

Massey was sentenced to life in 1976 
for shooting bouncer Charlie Higgins, 36, with a sawn-off shotgun after 
being thrown out of an East London pub for fighting.

He was also 
convicted of attempting to shoot a policeman dead after being chased in 
his Aston Martin getaway car.

An Old Bailey judge jailed the 
carpenter for a minimum of 20 years but he has become one of the 
country’s longest serving prisoners because of his repeated escapes.

The escape on Wednesday is a huge 
embarrassment for the authorities, not least because it is the third 
time Massey has slipped from their grasp.

Massey is suspected of hiding in the 
roof of the gym building as other inmates returned to their cells on 
Wednesday afternoon.

He then used a makeshift rope – 
believed to have been strung together out of sheets – and a pair of 
heavy duty gloves to scale the high  prison wall.

Guards monitoring CCTV cameras saw the
rope and raced to the perimeter wall at about 6.30pm but were too late.
They suspect he was assisted by someone outside.

A source said: ‘The guy went to the gym and then hid in the roof and just waited and then escaped from there.’ 

Prison staff have been banned from 
speaking about the escape, but one added: ‘He’s done this before, he’ll 
be back.’ Massey’s first escape was in 1994 during a home visit when he 
calmly walked out of a social club while his guards played pool and 
drank.

He fled to the Costa Del Sol and spent three years on the run before being caught and returned to Britain.

In 2007 he was released on parole but 
was told he must live in South London and could not stay with his 
family. But he broke the conditions by travelling to stay with his 
father, Jack, 82, who was dying at the Royal Free Hospital, in North 
London.

Afterwards, Massey said: ‘My dad had 
travelled the length and breadth of this country a thousand times in 30 
years in order to visit me in various god-forsaken and dingy prisons.

‘I could not fail him or my mother. To do so would have buckled my shoulders with guilt of unspeakable things to come.’

Two years ago he absconded from Ford 
open prison in West Sussex after being refused permission to visit his 
terminally ill sister Carol, who was in the same hospital where his 
father died.

She died two weeks later but rather than hand himself in Massey went to live with his mother and was not caught for ten months.

Last night, the sister of Massey’s victim said she was disgusted at his escape.

Mother-of-three Carol Spooner, 64, of 
Braintree, Essex, said: ‘I was stunned to hear it was the third time he 
had escaped. It is disgraceful.

‘As far as I am concerned, a life 
sentence should mean just that. 

'He should die behind bars. ‘I was very 
close to my brother and went to each day at court during the trial. I 
can still remember the jeers of his family, saying “At least ours is 
still alive”.’

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'This continues to be the subject of a thorough ongoing investigation and Mr Massey will be returned to prison custody as soon as possible.

'We always press for the heaviest penalties for those who escape or attempt to escape.'

Pentonville houses up to 1,250 category B male prisoners, rather than 
the most serious category A offenders.

Police last night carried out door-to-door enquiries in an attempt to find out where he had gone.

Pentonville was described by prison inspectors as one of Britain's most 
challenging jails to run last year, but the inspection also found 'no 
obvious problems with physical security'.

In 2009 a convicted arsonist escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of a security van.

Julien
Chautard was sentenced to seven years in jail at Snaresbrook Crown 
Court in February 2009, but spent just minutes inside Pentonville before
slipping out underneath the van he had arrived in.
