With their perfected poses, elaborate costumes and absolute stillness, they are a common sight at tourist hotspots across the world.

But one Italian man got more than he had bargained for when he stopped to photograph 'living statutes' in Rome.

The 39-year-old was chased and threatened by a gang of men after refusing to tip the street performers outside the Roman Forum.

Now, Italian police have arrested three Bangladeshi men - including one aged just 17 - in connection with the incident.

The tourist had already taken several photos of the 'statues' - who appeared to be 'levitating' while sitting on hidden platforms - when he walked away without paying a tip, according to  Il Messaggero.

However, he had only taken a few steps when he was set upon by five of the performers' colleagues, who had been waiting nearby.

The men - allegedly all from Bangladesh - chased the tourist down the Via 
dei Fori Imperiali, before surrounding and threatening him.

They then told the man he owed the 'statues' money and ordered him to hand over some coins.

However, the terrified victim - who has not yet been named - managed to flee the scene, before later reporting the incident to the police.

Officers launched a manhunt and have so far detained three of the five suspects. They are now facing charges of the attempted extortion of a tourist.

Influx: The incident comes as an increasing number of 'living statues' populate Rome tourist sites, including the Forum, the Colosseum (pictured) and the Pantheon. They are now almost impossible for tourists to avoid

The incident comes as an increasing number of 'living statues' populate Rome tourist sites, including the Forum, the Colosseum and the Pantheon.

The performers typically dress as recognisable or eye-catching characters, such as the Empire State building or 'levitating' mystics, according to The Telegraph.

They are now almost impossible for tourists to avoid, with locals complaining that they are cluttering up the capital's pavements.
