Way back when he first made a living as a disc jockey spinning turntables, it might have spelled disaster.

These days digital music means there’s not much Tony Blackburn has to do with his thumb, not even a badly injured one, except to give a cheery thumbs up to his diehard fans.

The 71-year-old DJ had a painful argument with his electronically controlled garage door - and came off worse.

DJ Tony Blackburn showed off his bandaged thumb during an appearance on Sky News. The 71-year-old accidentally caught it in his electronically-controlled garage door at his home in Hertfordshire on Monday

He got his left thumb trapped between the door and a wall when he was closing it on Monday at his home in Hertfordshire.

‘I quickly pulled it out otherwise I would have lost it,’ he explained yesterday. ‘I was very brave though.’

The broadcaster and former I’m a Celebrity ‘king of the jungle’ titleholder was rushed to the accident and emergency department of his local hospital by his wife Debra, where he was given nine stitches and a bandage.

Yesterday on Sky TV he praised the NHS, revealed that he didn’t cry - and that he ‘got a sweetie’ afterwards for being a good boy. 

Holding the cartoon-style thumb aloft he joked: ‘The great thing is that it isn’t noticeable.’

The veteran DJ, whose mother was a nurse and father a GP, began his career on Radio Caroline when the pirate ship began broadcasting in 1964 and spun the first disc to launch Radio 1 three years later. 

Tony Blackburn praised the NHS following his trip to A&E where he received nine stitches in his thumb following the mishap

He has since hosted a succession of radio shows and is the first person in the history of British radio’s top awards to win a lifetime achievement award twice.

Yesterday at home, where the offending garage door is visible from the road, he was recording an interview about his half century in broadcasting.

His agent Nick Canham told the Daily Mail: ‘He genuinely doesn’t know how it happened - he just shut the garage door and his hand became trapped in the side of it.’

Mr Blackburn was right handed, he confirmed - and would normally use that hand to spin discs anyway.

The mishap comes after another recent hospital visit, in which he was treated for sciatica in one leg.

He tweeted afterwards that he had watched ten ‘ten Corries’ while recuperating.

Yesterday he told his 34,000 Twitter followers what happened with his thumb and added: ‘Thanks NHS!’

Recent figures from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) suggest nearly 5,000 injuries a year are caused by electronic garage doors and of those, hundreds of victims needed hospital treatment.
