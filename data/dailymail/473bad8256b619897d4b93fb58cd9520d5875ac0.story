The father of Michigan's first surviving set of sextuplets has died at the age of 39 while playing with his children.

Ben Van Houten suffered a heart attack on Wednesday night shortly after setting up a trampoline at his home in the Holland-area in western Michigan. 

Mr Van Houten's wife, Amy, gave
 birth three months' prematurely to six children over three days at a Grand Rapids hospital in 2004.

Devastating loss: Ben Van Houten died on Wednesday at the age of 39. He is pictured with his family in 2008. From left, John, Ben, 15-month-old Drew, Nolan, Sammy, Kennedy, Peyton, wife Amy and Gerrit sit together in their home in Hamilton

Mr Van Houten's father-in-law said that he loved nothing more than spending time with his children (picture taken in 2006)

The newborns were tiny at birth; the largest was only 2lb 1oz. The sextuplets - John, Nolan, Peyton, Gerrit, Kennedy and Sammy - are all now ten years old. Two of the boys, John and Gerrit, have cerebral palsy and require special care.

'It's scary to think we're responsible now,' Ben Van Houten joked in 2004, when daughter Samantha was the first to leave the hospital.

Several years later, Mrs Van Houten, a preschool teacher, gave birth to a daughter Drew, now seven.

Father-in-law Calvin Reimink told The 
Grand Rapids Press that Van Houten was playing with his children when 
the heart attack occurred.

Mr Reimink says knowing Mr Van Houten even for one day was a 'blessing'. He added that the 39-year-old was always spending time with his children and was the best son-in-law.

The father-of-seven had worked for many years at UTV/SUD, a global testing company.

He was a deacon at the Calvary Baptist Church and a Christian youth program leader.

Mr Reimink said that Mr Van Houten's father John had died of a heart attack at just 40 years old.

Sue
 Herweyer of Dykstra Life Story Funeral Home in Holland confirmed the 
death and says the funeral home is handling arrangements.
