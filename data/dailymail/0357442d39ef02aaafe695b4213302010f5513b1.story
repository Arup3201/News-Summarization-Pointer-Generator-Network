Suicide: Stephen Gale, 57, a partner at a City law firm, drank two bottles of wine most lunchtimes

A top lawyer whose tax affairs were being investigated by HM Revenue & Customs committed suicide, an inquest has heard.

Stephen Gale, 57, a partner at City law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, was found in the bath of his penthouse flat in Islington, London, having taken a fatal drugs overdose.

He had invested in two tax syndicates which were being probed by HMRC, while his son Sam had been charged with a serious crime and was facing a lengthy jail term if found guilty.

Mr Gale’s personal assistant Samantha Andrews, who had worked with him for 12 years, said she had noticed a ‘big’ change in her boss in the months before his death in February.

She said that he had seemed distracted, drank two bottles of wine with a whisky chaser most lunchtimes and on one occasion walked around the office building in his socks.

Ms Andrews added: ‘He seemed to be running out of steam. He seemed aged all of a sudden - he was forgetting things and seemed to be getting to him. He was in his own little world. He told me he was at the end of his tether.

‘When I saw an email saying his son was in court on Monday, I thought “My God, this is going to finish him off”. I didn’t know what the charges were but it seemed serious - he could go down for a very long time.

‘I remember Stephen telling his mother she would probably never see Sam again. He had invested in a couple of tax syndicates which were being investigated by Customs - he was worried about that.

‘He was generally a happy person and we had a good laugh. But in the couple of months before his death he had changed. He started being rude, he would have outbursts and attack me for no reason.

‘Sometimes when I was speaking he would not grasp what I was saying - I had noticed the change in the past year. He was muddled and forgetful. It seemed sometimes I was thinking for him, as if he couldn’t be bothered, or couldn’t think for himself. I knew he drunk quite a lot.

‘He would drink a whiskey chaser and a couple of bottles of wine at lunch time when he was meeting clients, which was most days. He would think up excuses to get out of the office and he would drink at home.

‘On the Tuesday before his death, I noticed him walking around without shoes. He walked to the other building to get dinner without wearing shoes, which I and another colleague noticed.’

She said she rang the concierge of his flat, Charles Norman, after he had failed to turn up for work on the morning of February 13.

Mr Norman told the court: ‘I came out of the lift to find the door of his flat was wide open. I checked in all the rooms. The bathroom seemed shut but when I came back the other way I saw the door was ajar and a light was on.'

However, his wife told the inquest that she had noticed no change in the months leading up to his death.

The coroner at St Pancras Coroner’s Court, Mary Hassell, ruled Mr Gale had taken his own life after overdosing. She said: ‘Stephen Gale caused his own death and did so intending to cause his death.’

Mr Gale’s wife, Rebecca, who was at their house in Scotland at the time of her husband’s death, told the court that she had no idea he intended to take his own life.

Mrs Gale said: ‘He never suffered depression or unhappiness, he never talked about taking his own life and there was no change at all in his character in the time leading up to his death.

She told the court how in the days before his death, Mr Gale had made plans to cut wood with a friend the following weekend and had asked for fish pie for his dinner on the day after his death.

She said she phoned him the night before his death and he seemed ‘normal’. She said their adopted son Sam was due to appear in court and faced serious charges, but would not say what they were.

'He seemed to be running out of steam. He seemed aged all of a sudden - he was forgetting things and seemed to be getting to him. He was in his own little world. He told me he was at the end of his tether'

However she said she and her husband had taken her son’s trouble in his stride, adding: ‘He was not stressed beyond measure - it was more “Oh God, what will Sam do next”.’

In giving her judgement, Ms Hassell said there was a conflict between the image Mr Gale presented to the world and the internal suffering that had led him to take his own life.

She added: ‘There is a conflict here, he had a successful life and a happy marriage, there were so many things going for him and he never discussed taking his life.

‘But it is often the case with busy people he sees more of his PA than his loved ones. Her evidence showed he had changed, he was doing things out of character, he was drinking too much and was brusque to her to the point of being rude.

‘He told her he felt at the end of his tether. He was unhappy at the merger, he was involved in big cases, he was being investigated by HMRC and his son appeared likely to go to prison over very serious charges. I have no doubt but that he intended to take his own life.’

In a statement, his firm said: ‘Stephen was a talented restructuring and insolvency partner in our London Finance practice, with extensive experience of insolvency and corporate recovery around the world. Chambers recently described him a “world class” restructuring lawyer.

‘Stephen’s professional life saw him advising on many important and high profile matters for the firm, including acting for Ernst & Young as administrators of Nortel’s European, Middle Eastern and African entities.

‘He also advised JJB Sports on its groundbreaking restructuring and refinancing. In addition, Stephen acted for various Lehman creditors following that organisation’s bankruptcy.

‘He lectured widely on corporate recovery matters. He was also honorary professor in the Faculty of Law at University College London.’
