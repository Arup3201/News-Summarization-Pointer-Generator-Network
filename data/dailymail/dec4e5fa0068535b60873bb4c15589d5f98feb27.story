New York City will not offer a lifeline to Hatem Ben Arfa.

The Frenchman is looking to resurrect his career after his transfer from Newcastle to Nice was blocked under FIFA's three-club rule.

Ben Arfa has played for Newcastle United U21s and Hull City on loan so was prevented from playing for Nice as the U21s games are counted as competitive fixtures by the French Football Federation (FFF).

Hatem Ben Arfa has been told he must wait until the start of next season to make his Nice debut 

The former Newcastle United midfielder was released from his contract at St James' Park in January

The 27-year-old lodged an appeal but faces being inactive for the rest of the season. 

His representatives have contacted clubs in the MLS including New York City, as the league is not governed by the FIFA rule, however City head coach Jason Kreis has no interest in Ben Arfa whatsoever.

Ben Arfa does not want to kick his heels and be forced to wait until the beginning of the 2015-16 season in Europe to play football once again, but he has even contemplated retirement.
