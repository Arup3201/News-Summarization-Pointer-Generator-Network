Alex Oxlade Chamberlain expects to be out for two weeks. Scans showed the knee injury he suffered against Ecuador on Wednesday night was not as bad as first feared but it still leaves Roy Hodgson with a difficult decision to make.

Oxlade-Chamberlain has a slight strain in his medial ligaments and not a tear. It gives the 20-year-old Arsenal midfielder – who was seen leaving the team hotel for training with his team mates in Miami, with a brace on his right knee.

He has not given up hope of featuring in the World Cup. England’s first game is on Saturday week against Italy in Manaus but Hodgson must decide whether to gamble on the fitness of a player who has been beset by injuries this season.

The official England Twitter feed posted: '@Alex_OxChambo sustained a medial knee ligament injury against Ecuador. The team medics are continuing to monitor and treat injury.'

Oxlade-Chamberlain suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the start of the season and has been troubled by a groin injury during the final weeks of the season.

The game against Ecuador in Miami was his first start for nearly two months but he has been able to complete all the intensive England fitness work since the squad assembled last month.

He may lack match sharpness but looked in good touch during the 2-2 draw last night.

Hodgson may opt to take Oxlade-Chamberlain to Brazil and delay his final decision. The squad lists were lodged with FIFA earlier this week but teams are allowed to make changes if there is a new injury, up 24 hours before their first game.

There is nothing to stop the England boss calling in a player who is not on the stand-by list but Hodgson may well turn to Jon Flanagan or John Stones because they have been with the squad for more than two weeks and have done all the acclimatisation training.

There appear to be no plans to send him home at the moment.
