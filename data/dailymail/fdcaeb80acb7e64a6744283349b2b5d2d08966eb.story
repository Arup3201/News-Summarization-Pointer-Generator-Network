The widow of Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs is 'ready' for Hillary Clinton, and she's written a hefty check to prove it.

Laurene Powell Jobs has given $25,000 to the 'Ready for Hillary' super PAC, a political campaign organization that has raised more than $4 million to lay the groundwork needed for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's expected White House run.

Sharon 
Elghanayan Corzine, the wife of former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, also put $25,000 on the table. So did gay-rights philanthropist Tim Gill, who created the one-time desktop publishing software powerhouse Quark Xpress.

Laurene Powell Jobs' husband, the Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs, died in 2011 -- and now she's engaging in politics by backing Hillary Clinton

Clinton is still on the fence about a presidential run, but is raking in cash by giving public speeches. On Thursday a woman was arrested after she threw a shoe at Clinton while she addressed a Las Vegas audience

Hillary uses a Blackberry, but Mrs. Jobs probably doesn't mind; her late husband helped invent the iPhone, a creation that made him a multi-billionaire

Center for American Progress fellow Glen Fukushima and former California Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez matched their donations.

A source shared the list with Business Insider.

At the time of his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had a massive net worth of more than $11 billion, amassed largely through the sale of iPhones, iPads, Macintosh computers, and other innovative Apple products.

He and fellow tech enthusiast Steve Wozniak founded the company in 1976 in the Jobs family garage.

Ready for Hillary took in more than $1.7 million between January and March, including many token $20.16 contributions. All but 2 per cent of the PAC's 32,000 donors gave less than $100.

The committee set records for fundraising during its first six months of existence, only to be eclipsed months later by a committee to draft Ben Carson, the African-American conservative surgeon, into the Republican presidential primary race.

Neither group has an official relationship with its preferred candidate, but the war chests will be essential of Carson and Clinton decide to take the plunge.

Quark Xpress founder Tim Gill is the nation's foremost funder of gay-rights initiatives, and he's also put $25,000 behind Hillary

Federal Election Commission records show that Ready for Hillary has hauled in about $5.75 million overall, attracting the support of more than 55,000 financial donors. Nearly one-third of them donated more than once.

The average contribution to the group has been slightly more than $70.00.

Clinton, who was America's first lady and a U.S. senator before running the State Department during President Barack Obama's first five years in office, has hinted at running for president â€“ but has so far announced nothing publicly.

If she campaigns for the presidency, she will face difficult questions about her stewardship at Foggy Bottom before and after the 2012 terror attack that killed a U.S. ambassador in Benghazi, Libya.
