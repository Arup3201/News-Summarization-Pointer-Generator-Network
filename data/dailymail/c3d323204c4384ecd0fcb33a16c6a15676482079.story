Louis van Gaal admitted that Manchester United were ‘lucky’ to beat Burnley on Wednesday night and warned his players that they will go out of the FA Cup at Preston on Monday if they play that badly again.

Van Gaal confirmed that he will hold talks with United’s owners over the next couple of days to discuss his summer transfer targets, but he is still struggling to get the best out of the players at his disposal now. 

‘The first half was not a good performance and Burnley were the better team,’ said the United boss. ‘We could not keep the ball. I want to give all the credit to Burnley.

‘We cannot have that the next game because we’ll be out of the FA Cup. I think we were also lucky.

‘The second half was a little bit better. Not much better, but a little bit.’

Van Gaal admitted that he was concerned to hear rumblings of discontent among the Old Trafford crowd as his side struggled.

‘I heard the first whistles but also applause,’ he added. ‘That’s a concern because we are playing for the fans. They still supported a team that was playing badly, and I’ve never had that experience with my other teams.’

Wayne Rooney, who has been switched to midfield under Van Gaal, played even deeper in the second-half on Wednesday night after replacing Daley Blind at the base of the diamond.

The Dutchman said: ‘He wasn’t the Rooney that I want to see, but he has showed that he can play in every position.’

After the pre-match discussion about two long-ball teams, Burnley boss Sean Dyche was still able to keep his sense of humour in defeat.

‘The ball has been taken to hospital,’ was Dyche’s opening line after the game.
