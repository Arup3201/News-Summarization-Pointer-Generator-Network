Two of NASA's biggest contractors are teaming up with a European agency to create a 'space taxi' for when astronauts need a quick lift away from this planet.

Currently, NASA must 'catch a ride' from the Russian space agency when astronauts want to visit the International Space Station, following the retirement of the space shuttle last year.

Exactly what fare Russia charges NASA for the 260-mile trip is unknown, but NASA will certainly want to be less reliant on another nation for space jaunts.

So now NASA is funding space taxi research with four separate companies - Boeing, Space Exploration 
Technologies, Sierra Nevada Corp, and Blue Origin, a startup owned by 
Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.

NASA is reviewing bids for at least two design 
contracts, valued at $300 million to $500 million apiece.

The taxi service will be composed of recycled space shuttle parts along with a new NASA prototype spaceship.

The contracts for NASA's so-called Commercial Crew program, is scheduled to be awarded this summer.

ATK, which built the space shuttle booster rockets, teamed with Astrium, a company that is one of the manufacturers of Europe's Ariane 5 rockets, to bid for NASA space taxi development funds last year but was not selected.

The company continued to work on the project with its own funding, said Kent Rominger, a five-time shuttle astronaut who now serves as an ATK vice president and Liberty program manager.

ATK's new proposal adds a composite 
seven-person capsule, a launch escape system, propulsion module, 
avionics, an operations plan and other components for a complete space 
launch system.   

Rominger
said Liberty could be ready to fly crew to the station in 2015 for less
than what Russia charges for rides in its Soyuz capsules.

Rominger said: 'As a taxpayer, I want to get the best value out of what I've invested 
into our government. For example, Ares 1 (rocket program) was canceled, 
so to now pick up where the government left off is a very smart thing to
do. It brings us the best value as a nation.'

The Liberty rocket's first stage would be an extended space shuttle booster rocket, a design originally developed under NASA's now-canceled Ares 1 rocket program.

Liberty's second-stage engine would be provided by Astrium. The newly announced capsule, also named Liberty, is a composite spaceship developed by NASA as a potential alternative to the Orion deep-space capsule.

Liberty would fly from one of the space shuttle launch pads at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Depending on funding, test flights could begin in 2014.

Rominger said the capsules, which would parachute to a water landing, are designed to fly up to 10 times.

In addition to carrying seven astronauts, the rocket and capsule could carry cargo to and from the space station, as well as be used for satellite launches and other missions.

Rominger declined to say how much ATK and its partners have spent developing the Liberty system so far.
