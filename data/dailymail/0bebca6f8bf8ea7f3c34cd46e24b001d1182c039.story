After more than a week of silence from the bottom of the Indian Ocean, Australia's Prime Minister has conceded that the best leads will soon be exhausted - and the search for MH370 will have to stop.

Tony Abbott said that when all leads had been exhausted in about a week 'we stop, we regroup, we reconsider.'

The chances of finding the wreckage of the Boeing 777 in an area 1500 miles north west of Perth depend on the underwater drone Bluefin-21, which was today being prepared for its third launch after two earlier search operations deep in the Ocean found nothing of any significance.

The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre (JACC) today announced the drone had been forced to resurface to rectify a technical issue

The device was loaded back onto the deck of the Australian vessel Ocean Shield, where its data was downloaded before it was put back to work again

Mr Abbott told the Wall Street Journal that if the drone fails to locate wreckage, believed by analysts to be lying some three to four miles down on the Ocean floor, a rethink on the search operation would have to be made.

He remained confident, however, that the search was being conducted in the right area, based on electronic signals, possibly from the Malaysian Airlines' plane's black boxes - messages from the deep picked up by a 'ping' detecting device being towed behind the Australian ship Ocean Shield,

But while Mr Abbott held out what appeared to be diminishing hope, the use of Bluefin-21 has been criticised by the man who has been at the forefront of the search for the wreckage of the plane flown by aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart in 1937.

Mr Richard Gillespie, Founder of the International Group for Historical Aircraft Recovery, said that on one of his many trips to the Pacific Ocean searching for the wreckage of the Earhart plane he had employed the use of Bluefin-21 - and found it lacking.

'I can tell you, it didn't work for us,' he told CNN.

'We were very hopeful the Bluefin-21 would be the answer, the way to search for the very hard to find wreckage.

'What we found was that the Bluefin-21 couldn't perform reliably,

'We had extremely frustrating aborted missions, just as we have seen in the Indian Ocean.'

During this week's searches, Bluefin has had to be brought back to the surface early in each of its first two dives.

On the first occasion its safety programme kicked in when it reached a depth of about 3,000 miles and it came back to the surface.

When it was deployed a second time, it had to be brought back up to repair 'technical issues' before it was put back Into the water.

On each of the two dives it has found nothing that gives searchers any hope of locating the plane's wreckage.

The introduction of the Bluefin marks a methodical, slower paced new phase of the search, now in its 40th day and described by the search coordinator, retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, as the most expensive in aviation history

The drone was forced to end its first deployment early on Monday after it exceeded its 4.5 km (14,750 feet) depth limit in the remote stretch of ocean where search authorities believe the jetliner crashed after its disappearance on March 8 with 239 people on board.

U.S. Naval personnel have said the drone could take up to two months to scour a 600 sq km area where the plane is believed to have sunk.
