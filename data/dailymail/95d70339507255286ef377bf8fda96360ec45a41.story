But she has trained seven winners from a small team of horses on the point-to-point circuit.

Phillips has also helped tutoring the jumping of Michael Scudamore-trained Monbeg Dude, a chaser part-owned by her husband Mike Tindall who won of the Welsh National in the 2012/13 season and is due to have a second shot at the Grand National in April.

Phillips’ last runner on the official racing circuit was Manor Down, who was pulled up in a Hunter Chase at Cheltenham in May 2008.

Act of Kalanasi, once trained by Grand National winner Dr Richard Newland, ran in its first point-to-point for Phillips 20 days ago when seventh at the Royal Artillery meeting at Larkhill.

The Bangor contest is a tough assignment for the nine-year-old ridden by amateur jockey Tom David.

His 17 rivals include Teaforthree, the 2013 Grand National third, Pacha Du Polder, a one-time grade two chase winner with champion trainer Paul Nicholls, and Calgary Bay, whose biggest win came in the 2012 Great Yorkshire Chase.

He is in the care of Henrietta Knight, who retired as a professional trainer in 2012, after sending out over 700 winners including three-time Gold Cup victor Best Mate.
