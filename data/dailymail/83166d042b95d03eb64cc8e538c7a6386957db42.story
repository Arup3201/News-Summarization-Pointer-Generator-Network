Nico Rosberg will start on pole position for Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix after the stewards took no further action for an incident in qualifying that affected Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton.

On pole position by just 0.059secs from Hamilton after the opening laps in the final qualifying period, Rosberg locked up on the entry to Mirabeau on his second and final attempt, and was forced to take the escape road.

Behind the German, Hamilton was on a quicker lap, but with yellow flags being shown by the marshals due to Rosberg's incident, the championship leader had to abort a lap he has since claimed would have secured him pole.

Silence: But Hamilton admitted it was 'ironic' how Rosberg provoked yellow flags after his lock up

The stewards looked to see if 
there was any indication Rosberg's apparent error was deliberate, which 
in turn scuppered Hamilton's shot at pole.

They would have accessed all telemetry and data from Rosberg's car, in 
particular with regard to the 28-year-old's braking point compared to 
his previous laps during qualifying.

The FIA said a study of the data proved Rosberg had done nothing wrong.

'The stewards examined video and telemetry data from the team and FIA and could find no evidence of any offence related to the turn 5 incident,' the statement read.

It was reminiscent of the infamous 2006 incident in Monaco when seven-times
 champion Michael Schumacher was found guilty by the stewards of 
deliberately crashing his Ferrari at La Rascasse.

Like
 Rosberg, Schumacher was on provisional pole that day, but behind him 
championship rival Fernando Alonso in his Renault was quicker and poised
 to beat the German, but like Hamilton was forced to abort. It resulted 
in Schumacher's times being deleted, and subsequently he was demoted to 
the back of the grid.

The stewards did not find Rosberg guilty of any wrongdoing, and he retained the sixth pole of his career, and 
second in a row at Monaco after he pipped Hamilton to top spot on the 
grid last year.

Whilst
 Rosberg was naturally delighted, punching the air as he stepped from 
the cockpit of his car, Hamilton had a face like thunder.

It is yet more grist to the mill in the team battle that is unfolding 
between the pair this season, with just three points separating them in 
the championship standings.

Explaining the incident from his perspective, Rosberg said: 'No, it was not an ideal way to end qualifying.

Pace: Rosberg will start from pole for Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix after the stewards took no further action

Disappointing: Lewis Hamilton could only manage second place, and was denied his fifth consecutive pole

'I thought it was over, that the track would ramp up and someone else could beat my time.

'I'm happy it worked out. Pole at home is obviously fantastic. It couldn't be better.'

As
 for the fact Hamilton was behind and was two tenths of a second quicker
 before having to back off, Rosberg added: 'Of course I'm sorry for 
Lewis. I didn't know where he was. It's not great.'

Hamilton, in response, was terse as he said: 'I don't have an answer to that.'

Behind the duo will be the Red Bull pair of Daniel Ricciardo and 
four-times champion Sebastian Vettel, finishing three tenths of a second
 and half-a-second down respectively on Rosberg.Â

Then
 come the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen in fifth and 
sixth, with the latter an astonishing 1.4secs off the pace. Toro Rosso's
 Jean-Eric Vergne starts seventh ahead of a marvellous effort from 
rookies Kevin Magnussen for McLaren and Daniil Kvyat in his Toro Rosso, 
with Force India's Sergio Perez 10th.

The
 stewards, though, face a busy post-qualifying period as there are three
 other investigations to be considered, with all those incidents taking 
place in the initial 18-minute session.

Two
 concern a case of impeding, with Perez and Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez 
involved in one case, with the other involving Kvyat and Pastor 
Maldonado in his Lotus.

The
 final incident came towards the end, with Williams' Felipe Massa 
opening the door through Mirabeau for Marcus Ericsson in his Caterham to
 drive through.

The clumsy Swede, however, had too much power, running into the side of Massa and sending both into the barrier.

With
 Ericsson already at the back of the grid in 22nd, the stewards need to 
look at an alternative penalty as a loss of grid places will be 
meaningless.

As for 
Massa, although his time was good enough to get him into Q2, the 
Brazilian was unable to take part due to damage to his car and will 
unfortunately start 16th.

Ahead
 of him will be Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in 11th, followed by 
Jenson Button, comfortably out-qualified by team-mate Magnussen.

Williams'
 Valtteri Bottas and Romain Grosjean in his Lotus line up 13th and 14th,
 with the latter followed by team-mate Maldonado and then Massa.

The
 Sauber duo of Gutierrez and Adrian Sutil are on row nine in 17th and 
18th, followed by Marussia pairJules Bianchi and Max Chilton, with 
Caterham team-mates Kamui Kobayashi and Ericsson at the rear.
