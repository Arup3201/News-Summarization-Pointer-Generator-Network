Gold medals presented to winners at the Sochi Olympics will contain fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteorite that struck Russia last year.

The medals are not the official coins handed out in the Olympic ceremony, but special commemorative ones to be given out to the sportswomen and men who win on the anniversary of the meteor strike on February 15.

Ten medals will have a chip of the meteorite embedded in its centre, crafted by specialists at a workshop in Zlatoust, in the Chelyabinsk region, Russian media report.

By calculating the rate at which the jadeite must have solidified, the team were able to determine that the asteroid formed after a collision

The meteor fireball meteor that blazed across southern Urals last February was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century.

More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the 
explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs, as it
 landed near the city of Chelyabinsk.

The
 fireball measuring 18 meters across, screamed into Earth's atmosphere 
at 41,600 mph. Much of the meteor landed in a local lake called 
Chebarkul.

The 600kg rock, believed to be one of the largest pieces of this meteorite, is currently being exhibited at the Chelyabinsk Regional History Museum in the Southern Urals.

Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact

Destruction: Officials later said that if an early warning system had been in place, Russia would have been able to prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris

Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes  and measured 55 feet in diameter

The chunk was recovered from the bottom of Chebarkul Lake, some 60km west of Chelyabinsk, following a recovery operation in October.

Spanish
 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and 
claim it came from the large Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses 
passed Earth as it orbits the sun.

They
 added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused 
by the gravitational pull of the planets and the sun, or could have been
 caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit.

The Chelyabinsk government said it had struck 50 medals, which will be unveiled on Monday, and ten would be issued to the athletes who win finals on the anniversary of the strike.

The presentations will not be part of the official Olympic program.
