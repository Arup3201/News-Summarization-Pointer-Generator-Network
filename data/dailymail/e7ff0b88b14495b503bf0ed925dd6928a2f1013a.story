The National Security Agency may have the technology to collect and sift through massive amounts of electronic data produced throughout the world, but claims it isn’t capable of searching emails sent by its own employees.

In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the spying agency has claimed that it simply doesn’t have the correct technology to carry out such a search.

'There's no central method to search an email at this time with the way our records are set up, unfortunately,' NSA Freedom of Information Act officer Cindy Blacker told ProPublica.

The NSA, barely out of the news thanks to whistle-blower Edward Snowdon, claims that it doesn't have the technology capable of searching emails sent by its own employees

‘The system is 'a little antiquated and archaic,' she added.

A journalist for the website received the unexpected response when they approached the organization requesting to see correspondence between NSA employees and the National Geographic Channel regarding a documentary which had aired on the TV channel.

A few days after filing his initial request, Blacker called and was asked to narrow his request since the FOIA office can only search emails 'person by person,' rather than in bulk.

Blacker said he was bemused by the organizations response because it is quite common for large corporations to do bulk searches of their employees email as part of internal investigations.

The NSA has more than 30,000 employees.

'It's just baffling,' Mark Caramanica of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press told ProPublica.

'This is an agency that's charged with monitoring millions of communications globally and they can't even track their own internal communications in response to a FOIA request.'

On Tuesday it was revealed that intelligence sources now believe whistle-blower Edward Snowden was unable to access the 'crown jewels' NSA programs that secretly monitor telephone and online conversations worldwide.

After launching a wide reaching internal review demanded by President Obama, the NSA found that Snowden failed to see any ECI, or 'extremely compartmentalized information' according to one official familiar with the review.

The administration has said that it knows the material Snowden downloaded but sources told CNN that this does reduce the seriousness of the former freelance contractors actions.

Making a break for it: Edward Snowden's lawyer announced that it is in the leaker's best interest to stay in Russia for the time being before heading to a South American country for long-term asylum

'We are not downplaying it,' said one source to CNN about the amount of data stolen by Snowden.

The official spoke to CNN on background because the assessment is not fully completed.

On Monday Snowden revealed that he 
expects to be granted papers this week that will allow him to leave 
the Moscow airport and legally exit into the Russian city.

The
former consultant turned national security leaker has spent a month in 
the transit area of a Moscow airport and his Russian lawyer announced on
Monday that they hope it will come to an end very soon.

Anatoly
Kucherena, who helped the American file his bid for temporary asylum in
Russia on July 16, said Snowden thinks it is in his best interest to 
stay in Russia for the time being before heading to a South American 
country for long-term asylum.

Snowden reportedly believes it would be unsafe to try to travel to Latin America soon because of U.S. efforts to return him to the United States to face espionage charges.

Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena speaks to the media after visiting NSA leaker Edward Snowden at Sheremetyevo airport outside Moscow on Wednesday

'He should get this certificate (allowing him to leave the airport) shortly,' Mr Kucherena said.

Snowden's bid for temporary asylum in 
Russia may take up to three months to process, but he can pass through 
customs based on the initial response to his request, Kucherena added.

Snowden has not ruled out seeking Russian citizenship, Kucherena said.

Instead he is thought to be focusing his efforts on Latin American countries like Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua who have all said they would grant him political asylum.

The problem with those destinations, however, is that none of them are reachable by direct commercial flight from Moscow.

Snowden's presence at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since June 23 has strained U.S.-Russian relations, with President Obama publicly and privately calling on Prime Minister Putin to order his extradition to the United States.

Causing problems: The battle over Snowden has increased tensions between President Obama and President Putin, as the U.S. wants him back so the government can prosecute but Russia refuses

The drama between the two world leaders began shortly after it was revealed that Snowden flew from Hong Kong to the Russian capitol, with the white House claiming that there was a 'clear legal basis' to extradite Snowden.

Instead, Putin tried to deflect the issue at a press conference during a trip to Finland where he said: 'Snowden is a free person. The sooner he chooses his final destination, the better it is for him and Russia'.

President Obama has said he won't engage in any 'wheeling, dealing and trading' to get the leaker back on American soil in order to prosecute him for releasing top secret documents about NSA surveillance programs.

'I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get to a 29-year-old hacker,' President Obama said of the whistle blower during his trip to Dakar, Senegal.
