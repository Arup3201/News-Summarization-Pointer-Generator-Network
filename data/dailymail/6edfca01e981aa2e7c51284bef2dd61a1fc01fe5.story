However, social media users reacted angrily in light of the fact that they did not believe star player Rooney had lived up to his reputation as a footballing great.

Fans made retorts such as ‘Shame he can’t play football’ and ‘What’s there to be proud of?

Rooney, 28, was also trolled on Twitter with many users slamming his corner kick during the match and saying he was played in the wrong position.

Meanwhile, the Italian press yesterday gloated in their victory – even claiming that their WAGs are more attractive than those of the England players.

Gazzetta Dello Sport said that the WAGs of their team, including Mario Balotelli’s fiancée Fanny Neguesha and Michela Quattrociocche, the wife of former Liverpool player Alberto Aquilan, were more attractive the likes of Alex Gerrard, Coleen Rooney. Peter Crouch’s wife Abbey Clancy or Frank Lampard’s girlfriend Christine Bleakley.

Other famous Italian WAGs include 
Claudio Marchisio’s wife Roberta, a former tennis player, and Daniele de
 Rossi’s glamorous girlfriend Sarah Felberbaum.

However, the WAGs are not expected to meet each other in Brazil has Roy Hodgson has banned them from coming.

Despite this, Coleen is preparing to fly out to Brazil later this week with sons Kai, four, and Klay one.

She said: ‘I don’t want the boys to grow up and say, “How come you never took us to watch my dad play in the World Cup?”.’

She added: ‘I actually prefer watching the World Cup at home, especially when the weather’s fantastic.’

The England team schedule means she and the boys might not even get to see Wayne, but she said: ‘At least he knows we’re there and we’re going to support him.’

It is not known how many other WAGS will heed Hodgson’s ban but Alex Gerrard, 31, the model wife of England captain Steven, 34, was seen partying with friends on the beach of Spanish isle of Ibiza on Saturday seemingly without a care in the world.

The mother-of-three has previously revealed that despite Hodgson’s WAG-veto, she would travel to Brazil if England get through to the later stages.

At its peak, more than 15.6million watched the match in Britain, with many pubs staying open late after the Home Office allowed licencing laws to be relaxed during England matches.

England lost after Mario Balotelli scored Italy’s second goal with a header in the second half, cancelling out Daniel Sturridge’s equaliser against Claudio Marchisio’s opening goal.
