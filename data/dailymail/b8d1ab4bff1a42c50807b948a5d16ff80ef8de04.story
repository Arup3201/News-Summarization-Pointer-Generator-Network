Mischief managed: Rupert Grint is investing his Potter millions wisely

After rising to fame as Harry Potter’s sidekick, it seems Rupert Grint is working some magic of his own on his property portfolio.

The 24-year-old has set up a new company to manage the income from his multi-million pound housing empire, the Daily Mail can reveal.

And while his Potter alter-ego Ron  Weasley spent his time fighting the forces of darkness, Grint appears to have embraced his slightly more sinister side – by naming it Eevil Plan Properties.

The news comes as the star’s other  company, Clay 10 – set up to manage his film earnings – posted its first pre-tax profits of £8.6million.

The £12.9million Grint property empire is spread over a 20-mile radius in Hertfordshire, at the heart of London’s commuter belt.

The actor bought three properties around his home village for a combined £9.2million.

Another three, worth £3.7million, are registered in the names of his mother Joanna, 46, and father Nigel, 49, a former racing car driver listed as a co-director of Eevil Plan.

Grint, who is worth around £24million, lives in an 18th century mansion bought for £5.4million.

Set in 22 acres, it has five reception rooms, six bedroom suites and indoor and outdoor swimming pools.

His parents live in a nearby £3.35million mansion, also owned by their son and complete with a lake and putting green.

Grint and his father co-purchased another detached house for £495,000 which they renovated and now rent out for more than £2,700 per month.

Investment: This rambling Grade II-listed 16th century farmhouse has seven bedrooms and sits in eight acres of land, boasting a tennis court, swimming pool and stables

Family business: Rupert's parents' Hertford townhouse which they run as a boutique hotel

Following the success of the Harry Potter films, Mr and Mrs Grint paid £975,000 for a Hertford townhouse, which they run as a boutique hotel charging up to £150 per night.

They also own two large farmhouses worth a combined £2.7million, both in their names.

It is believed Eevil Plan Properties will manage the combined rental income from the properties as well as profits from any future sales.

Two other property investment companies owned by Nigel Grint – Wicked Ideas and Wicked Investments – are now dormant, presumably because he has gone into business with his son.

But while Grint’s property endeavours are thriving, the same cannot be said for his screen career.

Last year he appeared in box-office flop Into The White, in which he played a stranded World War Two aviation gunner.

And last month Super Clyde, a series pilot in which Grint played a fast food worker who inherits millions, was rejected by American network CBS.

It is a stark contrast to his Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, whose stage and screen careers have flourished.
