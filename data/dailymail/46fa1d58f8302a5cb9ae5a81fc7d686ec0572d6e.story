Her favourite is a 6ft, 100 pound 'gator named Peewee, who she grew up handling.

Samantha's father, Jay Young, 39, has lived among the animals since childhood.

He said: 'I gave Samantha her first alligator, Peewee, when he was a hatchling - they grew up together.

'She got her first bite at two because she poked him - he didn't break the skin but she cried.

'That's when she first learned that one end of the alligator is more dangerous than the other - after that she learned how to not get bit.'

After watching her father handle much larger alligators, Samantha learned the correct way to work with the creatures.

'Soon she was doing it too.'

At the age of five, Samantha was playing with 3ft long alligators.

While she has been bitten twice, she has not experienced any serious injuries.

Mr Young said: 'I know that she's going to get bit someday - I expect it, but she'll learn from it.

'The ones that she handles could at most take her finger, but she doesn't handle ones that could kill her.'

Until last year, Samantha suffered from hermivertebrae, a birth defect that caused her spine to severely curve inwards.

But her love for alligators meant six months after surgery she was jumping right back into the water.

Her father said: 'She had two rods put into her back, but she thinks she's invincible now.

'No alligator bite can compare to the pain she went through with that surgery.

'She jumped back into it, a little earlier than she should have - but she was itching to get out there and wrestle.

'She was sore the next day, but she didn't care.'
