A suburban New York police chief says a retired officer's suicide note indicates that the killing of his teenage daughters in their beds was a premeditated act.

Harrison Police believe Glen Hochman, 52, shot and killed his daughters, 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna, and himself on Saturday. His wife and a third, older, daughter Samantha were not at home.

Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said the note was found with Hochman's body in the garage of their home in the Westchester County town of Harrison.

Marraccini said Monday that former White Plains Officer Glen Hochman had no known health or psychiatric problems. He says there also were no indications of alcohol or drug use.

Dead: Glen Hochman, (back left) 52, a police officer of 22 years who only retired in January, is believed to have murdered his two daughters Deanna Hochman, 13 (front, right) and Alissa Hochman, (front, left) 17, on Saturday afternoon. Above, he is also seen with wife Anamarie (center) and eldest daughter Samantha (right)

Investigation: Police say that the couple was discussing separation at the time of the killings and that there had been a family discussion about the subject. They would not say if this was considered a motive

Scene: Police arrived at this home at 1 Adelphi Avenue in the Westchester County village of Harrison on Saturday night to find  Hochman and his two teen daughters dead

Marraccini said 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna apparently were asleep when they were shot sometime after 2 a.m. Saturday.

Their parents had discussed a possible separation in mid-January. Hochman's wife went to police on Friday to report a non-violent argument because an acquaintance had urged her to document such incidents.

And on the day before the killings, Glen Hochman's wife Anamarie had gone to police to report an argument over an $80 cellphone bill, said Harrison police Chief Anthony Marraccini, but there was no indication of violence.

'She didn't want us to pursue it, she just wanted to document it,' the chief said of the 50-year-old mother.

The chief said his investigation had turned up that there had been 'a family discussion about a possible separation.'

The girls' bodies were found in the main level of the home. Three dogs had also been shot to death.

Marraccini said Monday that the handgun recovered near Hochman's body, believed to be the weapon in the killings, belonged to Hochman. 

Family torn apart: Glen Hochman is seen here with his two victims, daughters Alissa (right) and Deanna (center). Anamarie and Samantha were not home at the time of the tragedy, police have confirmed

Killed: Alissa, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, and Deanna, 13, were found dead around 3.50pm

He and his daughters were were found dead about 3.50pm inside their home in the village of Harrison, about 20 miles northeast of Manhattan. 

Marraccini said police went to the home in the Westchester County village of Harrison after a person reported that no one was answering the door.

'It looks at this time that the father killed the two girls and then himself,' Marraccini said. He said Monday that there was not yet any official finding of cause of death.

White Plains Police Commissioner David Chong released a statement identifying the former officer as Hochman, and called the deaths 'an unfathomable tragedy'.

Chong said the department is 'shocked and horrified by the news', according to The Journal News.

'We can only pray for the family,' he said.

'Officer Hochman served this department and the city of White Plains with honor and integrity for over 22 years.'

Last year, Hochman won the department's lifesaving award for keeping an unresponsive man alive until paramedics arrived.

Hochman suffered an Achilles' injury in early May when he fell while helping a disabled motorist.

He had time off to recover according to his union lawyer, Warren Roth, who had known Hochman for more than 25 years, since both worked as EMTs with the Harrison ambulance corps.

He said Hochman sought a disability retirement because of the injury but had not been depressed over it as he was planning for retirement soon anyway

'It's just devastating to a lot of people,' Mr Roth said. 

Murder-suicide: Investigators worked through the night on Saturday inside the home. Police said they found a letter next to Hochman's body, and that the note 'gave some indication of motive'

Victims: The Harrison school district said that Deanna (left) and her sister Alissa (right) were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy'

'He was always a quiet, reserved guy, nothing ever seemed to unsettle him... And he was wonderful with his daughters, a devoted father. That's the scary part. There was absolutely no seeing this coming.'

Residents of the upper middle-class neighborhood discussed the shootings in quiet tones as they shoveled snow Sunday.

Howard Hollander, 52, an airline pilot who lives five doors down from the Hochmans, said Hochman 'was always taking care of the property, landscaping, cleaning up the yard.'

'The girls said hi whenever they passed,' Mr Hollander said. 'I remember one was learning to drive and beeped at us as she went by.'

He added, 'There was no indication at all of any problem, that something like this would happen.'

Another neighbor, Dante Garritano, 52, an engineer, said he went outside when he saw ambulances and police cars Saturday.

'I walked out and I heard a woman crying, screaming, on her phone, 'My God, they're dead. He killed himself,'' Mr Garritano said.

In a statement on the Harrison school district's website, Superintendent of Schools Louis N. Wool said Alissa, a high school senior, and Deanna were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy.'

He said the response of the district community to past tragedies has been inspiring and that he expects the students and staff will be no less resilient this time.

'In this awful moment, let us remember how proud we are of (the high school community), how much they have helped others and how much they will help others again,' Wool said.

Harrison High School, opened its campus on Sunday for grief counseling.
