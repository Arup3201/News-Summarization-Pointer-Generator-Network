A former Labour councillor who broke his girlfriend's wrist after she accused him of flirting with another woman at a civic function has been spared jail.

Matthew Fry, 34, shoved partner Ann Simmons, 41, into a door after they rowed about his 'flirtatious behaviour' at a council ball on Boxing Day last year.

A court heard the bust-up started after the politician attended the Stoke-on-Trent City Council event alone because Miss Simmons was unable to attend.

The next day she saw Facebook messages about his flirty behaviour at the party before accusing him of chatting up a woman and trying to sleep with her.

The councillor then lashed out and pushed her into a door causing her to suffer a broken wrist.

Magistrates also heard Fry punched Miss Simmons in the face while she was driving a month later on January 24.

The following day he attacked his partner again after turning up drunk at her home at 4am where he punched her twice in the face.

Fry admitted one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two charges of assault by beating at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on February 12.

But he avoided prison and was sentenced to 16 weeks in jail, suspended for 12 months at the same court.

Fry - who represents the suburb of Weston Coyney, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire - was also ordered to pay £1,000 compensation and attend a domestic abuse programme.

Prosecutor Edward Saulsby said the couple had been together for about one year and were planning to get engaged.

But the relationship became strained following the row following the Boxing Day function.

He said: 'Miss Simmons believed there had been a flirtatious incident at the ball between Mr Fry and another lady. It caused a row.

'This resulted in him storming off to leave and her blocking the door.

'Mr Fry said he attempted to move her out of the way by pulling her and he accepts running at her, connecting with her arm and the door.

'Her arm connected with the door which caused the injury - a fracture to the right wrist.'

Rebecca Dulson, defending, said: 'Mr Fry fully accepts responsibility for his actions and expresses remorse.

'He has voluntarily contacted a counselling service in an attempt to deal with the issues he has.

'He has no previous convictions.'

Fry left the Labour party in February last year and now sits as a non-aligned member of the council.
