Kim Smith, wife of Seth Adam Smith who wrote a blog post about his fear of commitment titled 'Marriage is not for you,' has admitted that her first reaction to the online article was negative.

But after Kim read the post, which has been viewed more than 24million times, she realized it was not what it seemed.

'I had the same reaction any woman would have when I first saw the title,' she told Good Morning America.

Kim Smith, wife of Seth Adam Smith who wrote a blog post about his fear of commitment titled 'Marriage is not for you,' has admitted that her first reaction to the online article was negative

When Seth began to struggle in his marriage of 18 months to Kim, who had became ever more dedicated to her graduate studies in theater, which led the couple to relocate to Florida, the Alaskan-native  said he felt isolated and began to push Kim away.

'We were living in the same house but we were growing apart,' he said.

When the tension culminated in an argument, Seth anticipated a blowout with a defensive Kim. But instead, his wife responded with compassion.

'I felt like I had two choices, I could react in anger and our 
relationship would get worse, or I could try and see past my own hurts 
and my own frustrations and try and see what Seth was feeling,' she admitted.

That moment reminded Seth of advice 
his father had shared before the couple married, when Seth felt 
'paralyzing fear' about whether he was making the 'right' choice'

After Kim read the post, which has been viewed 24million times, she realized it was not what it seemed

'I had the same reaction any woman would have when I first saw the title,' she told Good Morning America

'I'm going to make this really simple: marriage isn't for you,' Seth's father had said at the time. 'You don't marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy.'

So Smith turned to the Internet to share his experience.

'I realized that I had lost sight of what marriage was really about and 
was losing Kim in the process,' Seth admitted. 'As well as her hopes and dreams.'

'I could react in anger and our 
relationship would get worse, or I could try and see past my own hurts 
and my own frustrations'

Under the loaded title, 'Marriage is not for you,' Seth wrote on his blog: 'Having been married only a year and a half, I've recently come to the conclusion that marriage isn't for me.'

Seth, a Mormon, met his wife Kim when they were just 15 years old.

They were friends for ten years before their relationship became something more, and a year-and-a-half ago, they got married.

'The
 nearer Kim and I approached the decision to marry, the more I was 
filled with a paralyzing fear. Was I ready? Was I making the right 
choice? Was Kim the right person to marry? Would she make me happy?' he 
wrote.

But a conversation with his father put rest to any doubts Smith had about his upcoming nuptials.

'Seth, you’re being totally selfish. So 
I’m going to make this really simple: marriage isn’t for you. You don’t 
marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy,' 
Smith's father told him.

'More than that, your marriage isn’t for yourself, you’re marrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that nonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you raise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isn’t for you. It’s not about you. Marriage is about the person you married,' he said.

Seth, adding his own commentary to his father's advice, concluded: 'No, a true marriage (and true love) is never about you. It's about the person you love - their wants, their needs, their hopes, and their dreams. Selfishness demands, "What's in it for me?" while Love asks, "What can I give?"'

Initially, the blogger, who also edits a site called ForwardWalking.com, received criticism from some 
readers who feared he was forsaking his needs to tend to someone 
else, but he insists that misses the point.

Kim admitted she was touched by the post - and surprised when it went viral, with thousands of people commenting on her marriage.

One commenter wrote, 'Loved it! After 15
 years of marriage, and several near misses with that grey line in the 
affair department, my husband finally figured that out... I finally was 
ready to walk away...  He would now tell you he was so wrong and not 
thinking about that other ‘person’ he should have been taking care of – 
our marriage.'

Another tweeted, 'Thanks for posting 
that "marriage isn't for you" article it changed my mind on that 
archaic, disenfranchising, and oppressive tradition!'

It's also received backlash from cynics for what they called, an overly simplistic view of marriage.

'One of the most overrated institutions on the planet. Only makes sense if you don't have a Will,' wrote a commentator on HuffPost.

'Marriage isn't for men, with the divorce laws, child support and alimony what man wants to get married,' said another.

'And
 marriage isn't for women either, because in most cases you just end up 
being a nanny, nurse, housekeeper, second income, etc,' came the 
retort. 

'Sounds like a nice sentiment. Could 
not help but thinking though that it would have a lot more credibility 
if the author had made it past the 2 year mark first... It can be a lot 
more difficult than you ever expected despite good intentions and a lot 
of hard work. People can be unpredictable over the long haul,' wrote 
another.

Cosmopolitan magazine
 responded with an article entitled, 'Stop lying, marriage is for you,' 
which argued that marrying someone you love because it will make your life better isn't a bad thing.
