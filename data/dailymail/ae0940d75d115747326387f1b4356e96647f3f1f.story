A Scottish holidaymaker has died after suffering a suspected heart attack while scuba diving in Lanzarote.

Former paratrooper William Clephane was on a scuba diving course when he got into difficulties while submerged under water and had to be pulled from the sea.

Paramedics fought to save the 59-year-old, who was on holiday with his family at the resort of Puerto del Carmen, but they could not revive him and he was pronounced dead at the quayside.

A Spanish police source said: ‘The initial inquiries all point to him dying as the result of a tragic accident. It appears he became nervous and was waving his arms around and swallowed water.’

Mr Clephane, from Scone, Perthshire, was diving with four other tourists and an instructor when he got into difficulties.

The tragedy happened on  Saturday around 10.30am during a ‘discover diving’ course with British-run centre Safari Diving.

A spokesman for the centre said Mr Clephane was not a novice and had completed several dives. He refused to comment further until it became more clear what had happened.

Relatives were being comforted by friends at Mr Clephane's home.

William’s son, who did not give his name, told the Mirror: 'We don’t know exactly what happened yet and we are waiting to find out the results. It’s still very fresh.

'We know he was diving when it happened.'

An investigating judge in Spain has been put in charge of a  routine inquiry into Mr Clephane’s death.

A post-mortem examination took place over the weekend but the preliminary results have not been made public.

At Mr Clephane’s home in Scone yesterday, a man who confirmed he was the dead man’s son said the family was still coming to terms with the tragedy.

The man, who did not want to be named, added: ‘We don’t know exactly what happened yet and we are waiting to find out the results.’
