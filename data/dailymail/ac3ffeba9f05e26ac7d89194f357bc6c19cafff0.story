Beaten to death: Four-year-old Godrich suffered horrific injuries allegedly at the hands of his father who padlocked his mouth shut to stop him screaming during the attack

A Nigerian father has been arrested after he allegedly padlocked his son's mouth shut to stop him screaming while he battered him to death.

Chris Elvis, 30, allegedly accused four-year-old Godrich of being an 'Ogbanje' or 'child of evil' and blamed him for his bad luck in recent days.

The security guard beat his son, burned him all over his body with a hot iron and then locked him in a plastic drum, according to court documents.

The child's mother called police after returning from the market to find her son's horrific death.

Elvis
 tried to act mentally ill when he was arrested, but the authorities 
said his condition was normal, according to International Business 
Times.

He is being held in custody after being charged with murder.

The charge sheet 
reads: 'That you, Chris Elvis, on February 10, 2014, about 5pm at 7, 
Adetola Adelaja street, Meiran Lagos, in the Lagos Magisterial District,
 did unlawfully kill one Godrich Elvis, aged four years by using hot 
pressing iron to burn him all over his body and putting him inside a 
plastic drum and locked the drum with padlock and thereby committed an 
offence punishable under Section 221 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State,
 Nigeria, 2011.'

The alleged incident took place in the Meiran area of Lagos.
