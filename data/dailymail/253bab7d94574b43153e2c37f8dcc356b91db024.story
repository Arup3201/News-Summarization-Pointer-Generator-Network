A third of Britons would refuse to let their elderly parents move in with them if they needed full-time care, a report revealed yesterday.

But soaring numbers are choosing to take in a lodger – as long as they are willing to pay for it.

According to the research, just 28 per cent of adults would be happy for ageing parents to come and live with them if they needed 24-hour support.

Asked how they would feel if their parents went into a care home, responses included ‘sad, guilty, concerned or emotional’

But the overwhelming majority would not be so welcoming, with a third (32 per cent) saying they ‘would not let their parents move in’ and just over a third (36 per cent) admitting they ‘would have to seriously think about it’.

However when asked how they would feel if their parents went into a care home, responses included ‘sad, guilty, concerned or emotional’.

The report, by care home provider Care UK, touches on one of the biggest social problems facing Britain – the future of pensioners at a time when many are living longer than ever before.

As long as old parents are healthy and do not want to move in with their offspring, then all is well

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of centenarians in the UK has increased by more than 70 per cent over the past ten years, taking it to a record 13,350.

Meanwhile, the number of home-owners renting out a room to a lodger has almost doubled over the past five years, according to a separate report from financial services firm LV. The report said around 715,000 home-owners currently have a lodger, compared to just 369,600 in 2009.

In a sign of the financial pressure facing many Britons, the most common reason was ‘to help with the bills’, followed by boosting their savings and having more disposable income.

However unlike lodgers – who pay on average £3,000 in rent a year – many people’s elderly parents are ill, in need of care and are short of cash to pay for it.

Dr Ros Altmann, a leading old age expert, said she was ‘astonished’ that such a small proportion of children are prepared to have their elderly parents living with them. She said: ‘Family help should surely be give and take – not just one way.

‘Of course it is possible they feel their homes are not big enough to house their parents. There is so much loneliness among older people in this country and part of it seems to stem from more families living further apart. In other countries, there does seem to be a greater degree of concern for older family members.’

Around 2,000 people in the UK – whose parents are older than 60 – took part in the investigation about their willingness for their elderly relatives to live with them if they needed to.

Of those who said they wouldn’t let their parents move in, half said it was because their home was too small. Four in ten said they ‘would not be able to cope’, while one in five said they lack the ‘necessary skills to look after their parents’.

Common conditions among the elderly in need of care include dementia, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, heart disease or a general lack of mobility.

And the problem of care looks set to worsen over the coming decades.

For example, the Alzheimer’s Society predicts the number of over-60s with Alzheimer’s and related conditions could more than double from 800,000 to two million by 2050, putting huge pressure on both the NHS and social services.

Maizie Mears-Owen, from Care UK, said: ‘The thought of moving parents into a care home can come with great concern.

‘Often the decision is made at crisis point when parents need a level of care which families may not be able to provide.’
