Royal officials have submitted a secret planning application for substantial changes at the Norfolk mansion the Queen is reportedly planning to gift to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council is being asked to approve plans to re-route the existing driveway in order to make it more private as well as construct a new garden room at Grade II listed Anmer Hall on her private Sandringham Estate.

The application, which is described as a ‘major development’ in council papers, also involves converting a wood store into accommodation – which could be used for police guarding the couple - and extending an existing garage block to form an equipment room.

Queen's Sandringham House

The application was submitted by the 
Sandringham estate office on behalf of the Queen on December 10 last 
year, but details were only revealed today.

Earlier this week it was reported 
that the 10 bedroom residence was being lined up by the monarch as a 
country home for Kate and William, who are expecting their first child.

News of the new planning application 
will only heighten such speculation, particularly as attempts have been 
made to shroud it in secrecy.

Drawings and detail of the plans are not being revealed on the council’s website for security reasons in the normal way.

And anyone who wants to see the plans
has to be vetted by the police first and can only view them at the 
council offices in the presence of a planning officer.

A decision on whether to approve the 
plans is set to be made by council officers using delegated powers 
sometime before March 11,  instead of local councillors.

Residents in the tiny village of 
Anmer have been informed of the application, but no objections have been
listed on the council’s website.

Anmer Hall is one of the 150 
properties owned by the Queen on her 20,000 acre estate in north Norfolk
and is only two miles east of Sandringham House.

It is surrounded by estate farmland, giving William and Kate a high level of privacy as they gear up to start their own family.

It is believed that the couple want to change the driveway to give them more privacy and improve access to the hall.

At the moment the main entrance to 
the hall is about 100 yards down a tiny lane which is also used as a 
public road to St Mary the Virgin Church, where services are held twice a
month.

Anmer Hall which largely dates back 
to 1802 was one of the houses where Prince Charles and his then mistress
Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall, used to enjoy 
secret trysts, when it was rented by the prince’s friend Hugh van 
Cutsem.

William spent many childhood holidays playing in the grounds with the van Cutsem boys, who are all close friends. 

It was earlier leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house from 1972 until 1990.

The current tenant is James Everett, 
who owns a kitchen and timber company, and has leased the property until
2017, which means William and Kate’s son or daughter would be three 
years old when then move in.

The village of Anmer lies between King's Lynn and Hunstanton, on the edge of the Sandringham estate

The village of Anmer has no pub or 
shop and had a population of just 63 in the 2001 census, but it has a 
social club which is open on Friday evenings and Saturday lunchtimes.

The club is home to darts and 
dominoes teams and is the headquarters of the Anmer Mere Yacht Club, 
which has a Latin motto translating as 'Never make me sail'.

Villager Neville Warnes, 82, who has 
lived in Anmer for 74 years and has been in the hall several times, 
said: "I can't think that it would be anything other than good for the 
village.

'It's nice inside. It's got lovely 
frontage, facing south, and it's homely. It's got quite a lot of 
grounds. That's an ideal place for them to live and rear a family.

'It's isolated but surrounding the 
hall is the park where the child, or the children, will see the cattle, 
the sheep and get a general feeling of the countryside and rural life.'

Karen Melhado, who moved to the village from York in 2007, described the prospect of Royal neighbours as 'absolutely wonderful'.

She added: 'I would not move back to a town now I live here in Anmer. It's beautiful here all year round.

'Everybody gets on with everybody and
it would be nice if they would participate in some of the things that 
go on in the village.

'I would make them very welcome and I'm sure other people in the village would as well.'

William and Kate currently live in a 
rented farmhouse on Anglesey, where the prince is an RAF Search and 
Rescue helicopter pilot.

When they are not on Anglesey, they 
live at Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace in West 
London, which has just one bedroom and has been described as ‘cosy’.

However later this year they will 
move into the newly renovated Apartment 1A inside the palace itself, 
which was Princess Margaret’s home, while Prince Harry will have the 
cottage.

The new apartment will suit the couple’s growing family, as it boasts five bedrooms and three reception rooms.

The Sandringham Estate has been owned by the Queen since her accession in 1952 and by the Royal Family since 1862.

Although much of the land is open to 
the public, the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the Royal 
family relaxing there – making Anmer Hall even more of an attractive 
proposition to the Duke and Duchess.

Buckingham Palace has declined to comment.

A spokeswoman for King’s Lynn and 
West Norfolk Borough Council said: 'A full planning application has been
made and detailed drawings of the plans have been submitted.

'The drawings and detail of the plans are not being revealed on the council’s website for security reasons.

'Anyone who wants to see the plans 
has to be vetted by the police first and they can only view them at the 
council offices in the presence of a planning officer.

'The application has had its normal consultation period of 21 days and it will probably be dealt with under delegated powers.'
