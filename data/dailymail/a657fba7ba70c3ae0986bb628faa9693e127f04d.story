Furious animal-lovers are threatening to boycott the RSPCA after the charity abandoned a free service reuniting owners with missing pets.

Distraught owners who call Britain’s largest animal charity to report lost pets are now being directed to a little-known website where they have to pay to post details of their missing animals.

Until this month, people who reported lost pets or strays to the RSPCA national hotline or online would typically have the pet’s details passed on to the charity’s network of local centres and branches.

But now, callers are referred to the Pets Located website – run by  an animal-lover businesswoman based in Northamptonshire – which charges £12 to log lost pets, though listings for ‘found’ pets are free.

The RSPCA – which has been accused of ignoring the plight of animals while it pursues ‘naked political campaigns’ on issues such as fox-hunting – said the change was to free up its cruelty hotline to deal with calls relating to sick, injured or suffering animals.

But many of the charity’s supporters are mystified as to why it has entered into the new arrangement when there are numerous pet  websites already providing free lost and found services.

Di Fowler, an RSPCA volunteer in Hampshire, said: 'I don’t see why anyone should spend money on something you can get free. We work our socks off to fund raise funds and help people with pets. This will give the RSPCA a bad name.’

Dog-lover Belinda Bauer, 50, from Cardiff, is threatening to cancel her direct debit to the RSPCA. She said: ‘The Pets Located scheme charges distraught owners for listing their dogs, when there are well-organised sites offering this service for free.’

Critics have posted comments on social networking sites such as Facebook suggesting the new arrangement must be an RSPCA money-making ploy, a claim the charity has denied.

Nick Smith, from Guernsey, said: ‘It really does not go down well for the RSPCA to recommend a website which is charging people when they are most vulnerable.’

And Hannah Brighton complained on the Pets Located Facebook page: ‘Cashing in on distraught pet owners is disgusting. You guys should be ashamed.’

The change has also sparked confusion as to why the charity did not approach the UK’s leading pet matching service, Dog Lost, which has reunited 30,000 owners with their pets.

Dog Lost also traces cats, horses and other animals and has 10,000 volunteers who search for missing pets and help console owners.

Other free sites include Lurcher Search UK, Pets Bureau, Animal Search UK, Petpals, My Moggy,  K9 Search and Found And Lost Pets.

Caroline Key, 62, from Birmingham, spent £24 hoping Pets Located could help trace her beloved terrier, Rags, who has been missing since September 2011.

She said: ‘It’s a useless website. I’ve never had an email and I don’t know why the RSPCA is using it. It wouldn’t even let me register all of Rags’s distinctive markings and I got only nine possible matches.’

This compared with up to 40 matches on other websites, where no fees were charged.

Catherine Inglis, 43, who founded Pets Located and runs a separate telemarketing company in Daventry, Northamptonshire, insisted there were no financial ties between her companies and the charity.

She added: ‘It is possible someone only received nine matches. That could be because the person only asked to be told about close matches or it could be people have not found the dog matching that description.’

A spokesman for the RSPCA – which receives around £100 million a year in donations – said it had chosen Pets Located over a year ago as the only national service with ‘the most efficient website reuniting all animals with their owners, not just dogs or cats’.
