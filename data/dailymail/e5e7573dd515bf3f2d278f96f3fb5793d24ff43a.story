An NYPD cop being sued for sexual harassment by a former colleague has hit back, claiming the alleged victim was a willing participant who sent him sexy selfies and gave him oral pleasure in their police precinct.

Sgt. David John says Ann Cardenas sent him sizzling pictures, one of which shows the 29-year-old in a cleavage popping cat woman costume, during the two years they worked together at Brooklyn's 83rd Precinct. He claims her allegations are all a 
scam to get cash and now plans to sue the city for $35 million to 
compensate for his apparently ruined reputation.

But Cardenas' account are now being backed up by four other officers at the station-house, one of whom called John a 'manipulative, sick pervert' who created a 'hostile work environment for his staff.'

'I thought I was surrounded by friends and now I feel like Julius Caesar. They stabbed me in the back,' John, a 20-year NYPD veteran, told the New York Daily News.

His lawyer, Eric Sanders, described Cardenas as 'Poison Ivy' for her ability to reel men in and then 'kill,' and said he was intent on getting justice for his hard-done-by client.

'It's obvious she wasn't a victim,' Sanders told MailOnline. 'Look at the pictures, it's common sense.

'She's spanking his butt and sending him sexy cat pictures.'

The officer and other cops serving under John, 41, say the boss created a 'hostile work environment.

One, Peter Szumillo, described him to the Daily News as a 'manipulative, sick pervert' who regularly punched him in the chest for no reason and groped his private parts.

But John and Sanders believe the cops are simply out to make a buck from the lawsuit.

'They're putting it together to make money. They're schemers,' Sanders told MailOnline.

He added: 'These scheming opportunists make it less likely that real sexual harassment victims get justice.'

John has been placed on modified duty as the Internal Affairs Bureau and the Brooklyn district attorney's office investigate the claims. Sanders said he's fighting to get back his guns after they were stripped, forcing him to lose out on a chance for a security job he had in the offing following his retirement from the force.

Sanders admits that his client wasn't entirely innocent, however, though his mistake was failing to keep his staff at arms length rather than sexual harassment.

'He didn't follow his training, he got along too well with the troops. He may have been a poor supervisor but he wasn't a sexual harasser,' he said.

He said the female officer engaged in the locker-room antics like one of the guys and was intimate with her boss on about 10 occasions in an arrest processing room in the station-house before turning on him.

'She's a man eater, she uses men,' Sanders said.

'I want her job and those of the other complainants and I want city to compensate him because his reputation is ruined, his livelihood is ruined.

'I'm going to destroy her because they destroyed that man his reputation.'

But Cardenas' lawyer, Linda Cronin, has quashed John's claims, insisting her client was the victim.

'She was a victim of his aggression and intimidation and there are witnesses and evidence to support that,' Cronin told the Daily News. 'Any physical contact that there may have been (between Cardenas and John) was forcible.'

Cardenas' claims she was repeatedly groped and grinded against by the 300 pound sergeant who nicknamed her his 'work p****' in the discrimination suit filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the state Human Rights Division.

She says the 41-year-old showed her photos of his penis and crudely told her he wanted to have sex with her as well as rubbing himself against her while grunting.

The Brooklyn district attorney's office and the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau are also investigating the claims, which Cronin earlier described as the worst sexual harassment case she's seen.

'There was a frathouse culture in the precinct that was beyond the pale,' she told the New York Daily News.

The six-year force veteran describes an occasion in the summer of 2013 when she was sitting on a couch in the precinct and Sgt. John 'grabbed me, threw me down and held me down while trying to kiss me.'

The January EEOC complaint continues, 'He then climbed on top of me and would not let me up.'

The harassment allegedly went on for more than a year. 'He also showed me pictures of his penis and asked, "Is this big? It's bigger than your boyfriend's."'

In the complaint she alleged the harassment regularly took place in front of other officers.Â 

'Sgt. John often pulls his pants down in front of me,' she claims. 'He often sleeps in the office with his belt undone, and then will pull his pants down, grab his groin and say, "Ann, hold this for me."'
