Three fur-sellers tossed bleach and ammonia from a New York City roof onto animal rights activists below, police and online video show.

Lawrence Andrews, 35, Luis Justino, 40, and David Haber, 53, are charged with reckless endangerment, harassment and criminal mischief.

Prosecutors say the three men went to the top of a six-story Manhattan building and dumped bleach at an anti-fur protest happening on the street.

'You bleached a baby!' one person is heard yelling on a YouTube video of the incident.

 A number of other passersby were also struck by the toxic chemicals 

A few pedestrians were also struck by the cleaning chemicals. 

'It was definitely crazy,' animal rights activist Robert Banks told DNAinfo New York.

'All of a sudden gallons of bleach come crashing down — we saw a baby get hit, and it got on a lot of their furs, too.'

The child was not harmed, according to several reports.

Police say two of the men were caught inside the building with garbage bags reeking of cleaning fluid.

One of the men told police that he was told to 'go onto the roof and throw bleach and ammonia at protesters,' CBS New York reported.  

The men were arrested Dec. 20. They were released and told to appear on Jan. 26.

Gregory Gomez, an attorney for Justino, says his client denies any involvement in the incident and the allegations are unproven.

Haber suspects a set-up behind the charges.

'Why would we throw bleach on our own merchandise, on our own vendor, and on innocent people in the street?' Haber told CBS New York.

Activists say this man was one of the three people behind the bleach pouring that struck a toddler and several passersby 

Banks finds the charges ludicrous.

'It's pretty obvious who the troublemakers are,' the activist told CBS New York.

'We were just kind of looking at the cameras hoping that someone got it on camera,' Banks told the station.

'Luckily for us they did, because they could have blamed it on us.'

At least one protester was arrested on misdemeanor charges after a fur vendor reported being assaulted, according to CBS New York.
