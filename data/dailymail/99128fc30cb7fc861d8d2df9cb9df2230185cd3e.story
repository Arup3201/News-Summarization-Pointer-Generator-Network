Former Knicks guard Larry Hughes was reportedly led away from the Trump SoHo in handcuffs this afternoon as part of an investigation into a sexual assault.

Hughes was seen taken from the lower Manhattan hotel after a night of partying at the infamous club Greenhouse the night before, but police tell MailOnline he has not been arrested.

‘There is an ongoing investigation about a sexual assault,’ cops said.

Hughes, 35, was met by police at his door around noon, according to the New York Post.

He then agreed after a short discussion to leave with police ‘to be interviewed about an earlier incident,’ a source said.

‘It wasn’t me,’ he told the paper.

A hotel operations employee declined to comment on the matter when reached by MailOnline, saying only that they ‘respect the privacy of our guests’ before abruptly hanging up.

A source within the police department said that Hughes was not arrested and that the investigation is ongoing. He has been released from custody at this time.

Social media posts show Greenhouse was hosting a Knicks-themed season ending party Thursday night, Hughes reportedly attended.

It is not clear who attended, but no other players – former or current – were involved in the investigation.

A call to Greenhouse was met with a full voicemail box.

The six-foot-five, 184 pound swingman played 13 season in the NBA after being the eight overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1998 NBA Draft out of Saint Louis University.

He played with the Knicks from 2008-2010, and averaged 14.1 points over a career that saw him earn almost $85million, according to Pro Basketball Reference.
