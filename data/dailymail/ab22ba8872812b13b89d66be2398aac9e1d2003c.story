The Queen has gone green and started using hydro-electric power to light up Windsor Castle

The Queen has gone green and started using hydro-electric power to light up Windsor Castle.

In fact, nearly all the electricity at the historic castle is now being generated at a mini power station on a lock on the River Thames.

After a series of trials earlier this year, a deal to provide the green electricity has started, and two giant water turbines have been installed at Romney Lock on the river at Windsor to generate the power.

The Queen is the only customer and at times the generators produce so much energy that it is passed on from the castle to the rest of the town.

David Dechambeau, managing director of Southeast Power Engineering, which installed the turbines, signed a 15-year deal with the Royal Household.

‘I was in wellies and couldn’t go into Buckingham Palace, so I signed it on the marble handrail of a fountain in the grounds,’  he says. 

‘Fifteen years is a long time for a power contract. But it works as security for us and also for the Royal Household.

‘The turbines produce 2 million kwh per year, which is enough to power 400 houses — or one big castle.

‘To produce a similar amount in a conventional power station, you would have to burn  2 million lb of coal.

'There are times — during drought or flooding — when the castle will have to switch its supply, but the lion’s share is from the hydro-power turbines.’ 

Says a Palace spokeswoman: ‘The plant is providing a proportion of the castle’s daily requirements, but it is too early to say what proportion that will be over the course of the year, as the demand naturally varies between winter and summer.

‘The project is still in its infancy, so it is too early to assess the size of the carbon emissions saved.’

Phone hijack: Thieves ripped the iPhone 5 from Katie Melua's hands as she walked home

Sultry songbird Katie Melua has become the latest celebrity victim  of street robbers targeting smartphone users  in London.

Thieves ripped the singer’s iPhone 5 from her hands as she walked from a recording studio in Notting Hill to her home in nearby Holland Park earlier this week.

‘It was quite late, but with the weather being so gorgeous I thought a stroll would be great,’ says Katie, 28.

‘And because I’m not familiar with the backstreets, I was holding my phone out in front of me and following the directions on a map home.’ 

A shaken Katie, who last night sang for the Queen at the Coronation Gala at Buckingham Palace, tells me: ‘I heard running steps behind me and before I could turn to see who it was, I felt their hands grab mine and wrestle my phone out of my grip.’ 

Happily, the Georgia-born singer, who is married to superbike champion James Toseland, escaped unhurt. 

‘I was spooked and shocked, but I’m relieved they didn’t take my bag, too. Afterwards, I went up to a couple nearby and asked them to walk with me and help me find a taxi,’ she adds. 

In recent months, mugging victims have included Annette Mason, wife of Pink Floyd star Nick, who had her phone ripped from her hands as she walked across Hampstead Heath.

The affair between Leveson Inquiry lovebirds Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne, which has resulted in them both being investigated by the Bar Standards Board, has hit another snag.

Patry Hoskins has been unable to find a buyer for the house she shared in Islington with husband Mark Hoskins, from whom she is now divorced.

The elegant Victorian building has been on sale since December with a price tag of £4.1 million.

It boasts four bedrooms, a combined kitchen and living room, terrace, garden and laundry room.

Meanwhile, a senior member of the bar tells me the couple have been spotted holding hands in El Vino, the famous Fleet Street wine bar.

Hoofing it: Antalya Nall-Cain is the girlfriend of former matador-turned-writer- Alexander Fiske-Harrison

Last year, three people were gored. This year, two have been badly injured so far.

But it hasn’t deterred adventurous Antalya Nall-Cain from taking part in Spain’s famous but risky Pamplona bull run.

Antalya, 25, the daredevil daughter of Lord Brocket, joined a sea of runners as they sprinted ahead of a herd of angry bulls through the cobbled streets of the city during the San Fermin festival.

‘It was so scary,’ says willowy Antalya, who is also the girlfriend of former matador-turned-writer Alexander Fiske-Harrison, 11 years her senior.

Even a stiff drink after the adrenaline-fuelled event couldn’t calm her nerves.

‘Brandy is a must, although I felt sick afterwards, considering it was 8.30am,’ she says.

But Antalya, who is studying to become a nutritionist in London, is adamant she won’t be repeating her bull-running feat — made famous in Ernest Hemingway’s epic novel, The Sun Also Rises.

She adds: ‘I’m glad for the experience, but I’m not inclined to do it again. At least I earned the T-shirt.’

Seven years ago, TV explorer Ben Fogle and James Cracknell caused a stir when they completed the world’s toughest rowing race across the Atlantic — in the nude.

Now four polo-playing hunks are preparing to follow in their birthday suits.

They are Viscount Melville, former England polo captain Henry Brett, James Glasson and Jamie LeHardy, who will set off from the Canaries in December aiming to arrive 3,000 nautical miles later at Nelson’s Dockyard in Antigua in around 40 days.

Bobby Melville, 29, newly solo after parting from shoe heiress Melissa Lilley, is looking forward to the challenge for which he will raise money for children’s charity Right To Play.

‘It’s just as well I don’t have a girlfriend at the moment because, by the end, we’ll all have long hair and beards like Tom Hanks in Cast Away — which will be a scary sight,’ he says.

Adds Bobby: ‘James Cracknell has given us lots of useful advice, including sitting on sheepskin while we’re rowing to prevent chafing.’

Few are missing the late Lord Campbell of Alloway more than the bar staff at the House of Lords.

War hero Alan Campbell, 96, the oldest sitting member of the Lords, ascribed his longevity to a rigid diet of snifters.

At around 12.30pm every day he took three generous pink gins before getting stuck into some wine with lunch.

In the early evening, the heavy smoker would then sink four family-sized whiskies before toddling home, sometimes in his own car.

He married for the third time two years ago. He will be much missed.

PS Scottish Olympic swimmer David Wilkie takes a dim view of Alex Salmond’s saltire stunt in the royal box after Andy Murray’s tennis triumph at Wimbledon.

‘Bloody politicians. They’re always there,’ he says.

‘I thought it was a cheap, nasty political stunt.’ Stylish Wilkie, a gold medallist at the Montreal Games, says of his fellow Scot: ‘Salmond is using people for what they can give him.

'I’m sure he’s a cynical man and that shows the cynical part of politics. I don’t think it reflected well on Scotland.’
