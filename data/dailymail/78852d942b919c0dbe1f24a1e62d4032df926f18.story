A terrorist recruitment picture posted on Twitter showing seven British jihadis posing with AK47s has been ridiculed by other social media users who have called the group cowards for hiding their faces.

The men were captured in full combat gear, proudly clutching their rifles with balaclavas and rags covering their faces and hiding their identities.

An eighth UK-born terrorist, calling himself Khattab A Mujaji, posted the photo, which he had extracted from a nine minute propaganda video, and told followers: 'A few of the British brothers.'

Mocked: The photo showing seven British jihadis clutching AK47s was ridiculed by Twitter users who suggested that the men were cowards for hiding their faces

He claims to be part of Rayat Al-Tawheed, a group of militants who have travelled from the UK to fight for ISIS. 

The picture was supposed to inspire more Brits to join ISIS but was instead targeted by other Twitter users, who dismissed the gun-wielding terrorists as cowards.

One said: 'Such brave men and so proud that they dare not show their faces'. Another wrote: 'Pussies with masks'. 

Another Brit terrorist posted snaps of a sun-drenched lake captioned: 'Jihad is the tourism of the believers.'

But his comment sparked outrage, with one tweeting: 'Oh yeah, raping women, beheading prisoners, mass murdering is a great way to travel for evil.'

It has emerged that the British jihadis, responsible for holding prisoners including murdered US journalist James Foley and currently detained British journalist, John Cantlie, are known for their brutality.

In a recent video posted online, John Cantlie, a photojournalist and war correspondent who has worked for several national newspapers, said that he had been 'abandoned' by Britain. 

Propaganda: The picture was posted by an ISIS militant from the UK who calls himself Khattab A Mujaji

Speaking to the Daily Mail following the video's release, a source spoke of how James Foley and John Cantlie were tortured by British jihadis.

They said: 'The water-boarding was not every day – maybe two or three times. The British jihadis did the most appalling stuff in the world – they were psychopathic.’  

British militants forced hostages to take part in boxing matches against each other and the losers of these bouts were tortured. 

Reaction: Tweets show such of the comments posted by people in response to the British jihadi photo

The fights, which the hostages dubbed the ‘Royal Rumble’, were held almost entirely for the entertainment of their British captors, one of whom once claimed to have been a boxer in the UK before leaving to join the Islamic jihad.

During these forced gladiator-style bouts, the jihadis known as the ‘British Beatles’ watched from a skylight above in order to get a better view of the fighting below.

Security experts say ISIS is coming under increased pressure from Muslims horrified by its ultra-violent regime.

Many have begged them to free aid volunteer Alan Henning, 47, from Eccles, Gtr Manchester, after executioner Jihadi John threatened he would be the next hostage victim.

One source told the Daily Star: 'The fact these people are now being openly mocked on social networking sites proves they are losing the battle.'
