Compared to the multi-million pound super-yachts favoured by the likes of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and F1 presenter Eddie Jordan, this humble fishing vessel may not look like much.

However for former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, it hold precious memories of happy days with his first wife Linda before she tragically died on cancer.

Now he has made the heartbreaking decision to sell the vessel after a meeting with his children Stella, Heather and Mary.

Sir Paul McCartney is selling his 52ft converted fishing boat Barnaby Rudge anonymously for £60,000

The modest vessel is where McCartney spent time with first wife Linda before she died of cancer

According to a family friend the singer decided to part with the boat because it holds painful memories

The boat, named Barnaby Rudge after a Charles Dickens character, is being sold for £60,000 in Rye near McCartney's private recording studio.

According to a family friend, the adverts don't mention its connection with the pop star, saying only that the boat has an 'interesting history'.

Speaking to the Sunday Express, family friend Eric Green said: 'He has decided to make the break with the past and move on.

Paul McCartney married Linda Eastman in 1969 (pictured the same year, left) before the Beatles split up. The duo then formed pop group Wings which won several Grammy awards (right)

The couple enjoyed a happy marriage until Linda was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995

After a three-year battle with the disease, Linda died in 1993 on the couple's ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona

In happier times the couple spent a lot of time on the boat, and at this farmhouse in Mull of Kintyre, Scotland

'Paul no longer uses the boat because it has memories he does not want to dwell on because of the cruel way Linda was taken from him through cancer.'

A spokesman for McCartney said all proceeds from the sale would be donated to Oxfam.

Paul McCartney married Linda Eastman in March 1969 and the couple became virtually inseparable, often holidaying on their farm in the remote Mull of Kintyre, Scotland.

McCartney adopted Linda's daughter Heather and the couple had three more children, Stella, Mary and James.Linda was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995 and died just three years later.
