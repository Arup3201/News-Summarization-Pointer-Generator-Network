British aid money has been used by the EU to train Ukrainian soldiers in riot control.

Labour demanded an inquiry last night into whether the £1million project helped train troops accused of shooting innocent protesters during the overthrow of the Ukrainian government last month.

The revelation that money intended for the world’s poorest may have contributed to the violence came as David Cameron announced that asset freezes and travel bans will be slapped on allies of Vladimir Putin ‘within days’ over the conflict in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister said Russia should be excluded altogether from the G8 group of leading nations and that world leaders should set up a G7 meeting without the Russian president.

And he warned that the EU will act as early as this week to punish those responsible for the invasion of the Crimea if Russia continues to refuse to talk to the government in Kiev.

A hit list of Mr Putin’s henchmen who will have their money seized from Western bank accounts and face being banned from the EU will be drawn up today at a meeting in London involving officials from Britain, the US, Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Japan, Switzerland, Turkey and Canada.

Last night it emerged that the RAF will fly surveillance aircraft through Polish and Romanian airspace to monitor the situation in Crimea.

The AWACS planes will take off from bases in Lincolnshire and Germany to track Russian troop and flight movements across a 312,000 sq mile area.

If Russian jets were to enter Nato airspace they could be intercepted by US F-16s operating in Lithuania. The announcement was seen as a sign of a stiffening of resolve by Nato. The aid money sent to the Ukrainian government came from Britain’s £1billion-a-year contribution to EuropeAid, the EU’s overseas development programme.

Britain’s aid budget is supposed to be spent on tackling poverty in the world’s most impoverished countries. But Brussels has spent £2billion in Ukraine since 1991 to prepare the country for joining the EU. A document detailing where the money went includes a £1.29million programme to ‘help improve the efficiency’ of interior ministry troops in riot control in the run-up to the Euro 2012 football tournament, held in Ukraine and Poland.

Britain contributes around 14 per cent of the EU budget, meaning British taxpayers contributed around £167,000.

Calls for an inquiry: Labour international development spokesman Jim Murphy said it is important to find out whether those who received the EU-funded training were responsible for the brutal attacks on civilians

Meanwhile it has emerged RAF AWACS will fly over Poland and Romania to monitor the Ukraine situation. A file picture of a NATO AWACS plane landing at the Northern Italian air base of Aviano.

Some 240 Ukrainian soldiers were trained in ‘maintaining order in a soft manner’ and ‘techniques of restraining a person without beating’, according to a Brussels newsletter.

Hundreds of such troops were deployed during clashes in Kiev last month in which dozens were killed.

Labour international development spokesman Jim Murphy demanded an inquiry. ‘International aid money can be an important way of training overseas police and security forces so that they respect human rights and democracy,’ he said.

‘But we need to know if those that received it played any role in the brutal attacks on civilians carried out by government forces before the collapse of the Yanukovych regime.’

A European Commission spokesman defended the scheme, saying: ‘In the recent upheaval the vast majority of police officers did not resort to indiscriminate violence. With the full support of the UK, the EU provided funding to train Ukrainian police, not to beat people or abuse their rights.’
