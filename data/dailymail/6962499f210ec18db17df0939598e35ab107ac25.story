BP focused too much on small safety 
details instead of the big systemic hazards 
that led to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, a U.S. government safety panel has concluded.

The report also found the oil giant was not as strict on 
overall safety when drilling rigs involved other companies that they 
hired.

Eleven workers were killed in the 
April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig and around 200 million 
gallons of oil flowed into the gulf from the 
blown-out Macondo well.

The company had the lease on the well,
but the drilling rig was owned and operated by another company and BP 
has faulted drilling contractor Transocean.

Settlement reached: BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill released between 4 and 5 million barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico and claimed the lives of 11 oilmen in April 2010

That contractor-owner split made a 
difference in major accident prevention with the oil disaster, the U.S. 
Chemical Safety Board concluded in a presentation to be made at a 
hearing in Houston today.

'BP applied lesser process safety 
standards' to rigs contracted out than it does to its own facilities, 
safety board managing director Daniel Horowitz said. 'In reality, both Transocean and BP dropped the ball on major 
accident hazards in this case.'

The oil company 'did not conduct an 
effective comprehensive hazard evaluation of the major accident risks 
for the activities of the Deepwater Horizon rig or for the Macondo well'
because BP's large risk evaluation programme 'looked only at BP assets,
not drilling rigs that it contracted' to other firms for operation, 
investigators said.

A BP spokesman said the company 'stepped up' and developed more rigorous safety indicators following the accident.

The safety board said when BP looked 
at offshore endeavours it 'focused on financial risks, not process 
safety risks'.

And after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the company's 
own accident investigation report 'recommended requiring hazard reviews 
of BP-owned and contracted rigs', the safety board's presentation says.

'That's very disturbing because the 
Gulf of Mexico belongs to the American people,' said former senator Bob 
Graham of Florida, who co-chaired a different government oil spill 
investigation, one appointed by President Barack Obama.

A team of federal regulators concluded that BP has to bear the ultimate responsibility for the spill

A series of government investigations have spread blame for the disaster.

In January 2011, a presidential commission found that the spill was caused by time-saving and money-saving decisions by BP, Halliburton and Transocean that created unacceptable risk.

But the panel also concluded that the mistakes were the result of systemic problems, not necessarily the fault of any one individual.

In September 2011, however, a team of Coast Guard officials and federal regulators issued a report that concluded BP bears ultimate responsibility for the spill.

The report found BP violated federal regulations, ignored crucial warnings and made errors during the cementing of the well a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico.

BP has repeatedly said it accepts part responsibility for the spill and will pay accordingly, but has urged other companies to pay their share.

BP has established a $20 billion fund to resolve many of the claims out of court.

By mid January this year the Gulf Coast Claims Facility has paid out nearly $6 billion from the fund to more than 569,000 individuals and businesses.

BP waived a $75 million cap on its liability for certain economic damage claims under the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, though it denied any gross negligence.

The Chemical Safety Board's findings, 
which mostly mirror the report from Mr Graham's panel and another, 
pointed at a second standard for what BP owned and operated and what it 
did not. Mr Graham said he did not know that.

'If that's true, it's reprehensible,' Mr Graham said.

Congressional Democrats requested the 
safety board investigation. The panel usually investigates deadly 
industrial accidents and makes recommendations but has no power to 
regulate, much like the National Transportation Safety Board.

The panel has been criticised for its 
role in investigating the disaster. Transocean resisted complying with a
subpoena arguing that the spill fell outside the board's jurisdiction 
that involves industrial accidents onshore. An offshore rig is an 
ocean-going vessel that is motionless when drilling.

The board also had to push to gain 
access to the examination of the blowout preventer, and at one point 
demanded that the analysis stop, saying representatives of the companies
that made and maintained the 300-ton device have been getting 
preferential and sometimes hands-on access to it.

The board's presentation said there is
a difference between worker safety and making sure the entire rig and 
well are safe, and that's where owner BP and rig operator Transocean 
were 'inadequate'.

And that same lack of focus on the 
bigger picture of safety bore an 'eerie resemblance' to what the safety 
board found in its investigation of a 2005 explosion at BP's Texas City 
refinery that killed 15 people, safety board investigator Cheryl 
MacKenzie said.

That federal oil spill commission 
report, co-chaired by Mr Graham and former EPA chief William Reilly, and
a National Academy of Engineering found similar problems.
