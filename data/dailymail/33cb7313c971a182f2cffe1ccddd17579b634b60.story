Charlotte Jowett is devastated after a thief stole her handbag containing pictures of her critically-ill baby daughter

A devastated mother's online plea for help after a thief stole precious photographs of her critically ill baby daughter has gone viral.

Charlotte Jowett, 22, was heartbroken when she discovered hundreds of photographs of her 12-week-old daughter Olivia had been stolen - on the morning she was rushed into theatre for emergency surgery.

Ms Jowett accidentally left her bag in the canteen at Manchester Children’s Hospital a fortnight ago.

Despite being left unattended for just a few minutes, the bag had gone when she returned to retrieve it.

Inside the bag was her mobile phone, containing images of her daughter’s progress since being admitted to hospital 10 weeks previously.

Since posting an emotional appeal on Facebook, her words have been shared more than 100,000 times by social network users, who have branded the theft as 'despicable' and 'disgusting'.

Ms Jowett, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, posted: 'To the person who has stolen my bag from the hospital, if you see this, please can you hang my bag to security?

'You can keep my watch, the money - I just want the bag back, and the pictures of my critically poorly daughter who is only ten weeks old.

'Please can people share this and maybe someone will see it.'

She said the photographs, which have documented Olivia’s progress since being in intensive care, are 'irreplaceable' - especially as they contained the the  very first family photograph.

Ms Jowett said: 'We’ve lost hundreds of photographs and they were all very special to me.

'We very nearly lost Olivia so I’m always taking pictures on my phone trying to capture as many moments as I can.

'But one of the most precious to me was our very first family photograph. 'It was taken when Olivia was just a few hours old, before we knew about her condition and before she was rushed into hospital.  That’s been stolen and we can never replace it.'

She added that after Olivia was admitted, the large doses of medication she was on meant she slept for weeks.

'We took a picture of the very first time she opened her eyes after she was taken in and we’ve lost that too.

'Another photograph that was really special to me was a picture of her in an incubator when she was in intensive care. She was so tiny and had this little hat on - she looked so sweet.

'I can’t explain how much they mean to us,' she added. 'We almost lost Olivia and she has come such a long way since then - the pictures show just how far. I’m begging whoever has them to hand them in.

'I won’t be mad - I just want the photos back. They can do it anonymously and I won’t try and track them down.

'I really hope Olivia’s story appeals to their conscience. It’s an awful thing to have done.

'I’d been crying in the canteen that morning because Olivia had been rushed in and I hadn’t been thinking straight.

'I’m
 punching myself now for leaving my bag. Whoever took it has stooped 
very low - it’s a children’s hospital and nobody wants to be there.

'It’s
 hard for everyone and so many families are going through such a tough 
time. I can’t believe someone would steal from a place like that.'

Baby Olivia has been fighting for her life due 
to intestinal problems. Her mother now only has a handful of photos of 
her early days (pictured), donated by friends and family

'I’m normally a really positive person and look for the best in people but this has really shaken me.'

Baby Olivia was kept in hospital after suffering from intestinal problems following her birth in May.

And two weeks after her birth, she went grey and started vomiting, so was rushed into emergency surgery where doctors battled to save her life.

Her mother said: 'She wasn’t herself and she’d stopped eating. Then, all of sudden she lost all her colour and started vomiting faeces so we rushed her to hospital.

Ms Jowett (pictured with partner Nathan Lund) is now begging for the phone with the pictures to be returned, with no ramifications

'She was taken straight into surgery and doctors said had it been half an hour later, she wouldn’t have survived.'

Investigations revealed that when Olivia was born, the blood vessels to her intestines hadn’t formed properly.

'Instead, they had formed a growth which turned toxic and killed her intestine,' said Ms Jowett.

'She was in intensive care for a week and has had five operations, but now doctors are hoping she can be home by the end of September.

'Her intestine has been removed and she now has short bowel syndrome, which means she will always have to be on a special diet, but hopefully she will be OK.'

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We are investigating a case of a woman’s phone being stolen from Manchester Children’s Hospital.

'She left her bag in the canteen and when she returned it was gone.

'We are currently awaiting CCTV images from the hospital for further investigation.'

A Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS foundation trust spokesman said: 'We regret any distress caused and are sorry to hear of this incident.

'We encourage patients and visitors to keep their property safe and attended at all times.

'We would urge the person who may have possession of these highly sentimental photos to return them.'
