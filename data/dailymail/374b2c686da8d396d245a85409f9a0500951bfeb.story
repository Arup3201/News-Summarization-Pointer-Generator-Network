He has been investigated by police 40 times; has been accused of battery, car theft, boarding a plane with a loaded gun, and carrying drugs.

German Bosque is likely one of the worst repeat offenders in Opa-Locka, Florida - and he's a police officer.

Sgt Bosque, 48, who joined the force in 1993, has been arrested and jailed three times.

He has been disciplined, suspended, fined and sent home on full pay more than any other officer operating in the state.

Sgt German Bosque has been arrested and jailed three times and has been disciplined, suspended, fined and sent home on full pay more than any other officer operating in the state. He has now been sacked by Opa-locka police department in Florida

He has been accused of beating and stealing from suspects, ignoring direct orders and writing out false police reports, including one in which he hit himself to make an alleged fight appear genuine.

Bosque has been found driving with a suspended licence, with counterfeit money, and in possession of cocaine and crack pipes in his car. Girlfriends allege he has been violent.

Yet Bosque, who lives with his fiancée in North Miami, still manages to keep his job in one of the most notorious police departments in the state.

He has been sacked at least six times but each time he is reinstated. He is currently suspended pending an investigation into misconduct and is still reportedly picking up his $60,000-a-year pay cheque.

The Opa-Locka department has been the subject of multiple state and federal public corruption probes and a host of civil suits. Last year there were 41 internal investigations - the force only has 68 officers.

Sqt Bosque believes the campaign to get him permanently fired is a 'witch- hunt' and that the excessive force he used in some cases was necessary for his own and others safety.

He told the Miami Herald: 'Back then I was a big hot dog. I was catching bad guys, getting commendations while all the other guys were lazy.'

He added: 'I love being a
 policeman. I love looking in the mirror and the person I see,' before 
adding: 'I’m against police brutality.'

On
 his Facebook profile Bosque concedes: 'I'm conceited about only one 
thing in life, and that is that I'm an excellent Police Officer.'

Before he set foot in Opa-Locka, Bosque was kicked out of two police academies and two police departments.

Yet he is somehow always reinstated and is said to brag about his ability to play the system and exploit loop holes.

Even his police chief Cheryl Cason says Bosque 'is a time bomb that has now exploded'.

The
 Florida 
Department of Law, which reviews police misconduct, has repeatedly 
declined to kick Bosque out of the force for good. The department is not
 allowed to consider an officer's misconduct history when ruling on a 
specific case.

Retired 
North Miami Police Major, Bob Lynch, told the Herald: 'If a police chief
 doesn’t have the power to fire them he or she is helpless.

'It comes down to whoever has the final say, whether it’s the human resources director or the mayor. Plenty of police chiefs try to fire nasty cops and get stuck right back with them.'

Bad record: Last year there were 41 internal investigations at Opa-Locka in 
Miami-Dade County - the force only has 68 officers

One of the cases Bosque was disciplined for was for punching a 16-year-old in the face three times after police were called by the boy's mother after the pair had a row.

A fellow officer said he witnessed Bosque takte the teenager into another room and assault him, saying: 'I am the law, if I feel like right not I can f*** you up and no one will say nothing to me.'

Bosque admitted hitting the boy but the state attorney did not prosecute Bosque.

The police officer said the boy was 'trash, he had gold grills in his teeth. The kid is like a thug.'

Bosque was initially sacked after the incident but then re-hired. The boy's mother said Bosque did the right thing and even testified on his behalf.
