The mysterious patient who was quarantined in New York City with symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus has been revealed to be a 27-year-old humanitarian aid worker from Brooklyn who had just returned from Sierra Leone.

In an exclusive interview, Eric Silverman recounted to the New York Daily News the story of the three feverish days he spent at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital with diarrhea, a sore throat and headaches — plus the frightening feeling that he could have the untreatable and highly-infectious disease.

'It was surreal,' Silverman told the newspaper. 'Even my friends didn’t believe me when I told them I was the mystery patient. They thought I was joking.'

Silverman, of Prospect Heights, was on a four-month humanitarian trip in Sierra Leona earlier this year, doing agriculture and construction work in a village not too far from where Ebola began to spread.

He traveled back to New York on July 17 for his mother's birthday. Then last Sunday, just two weeks later, the symptoms began.

Silverman was on the Upper West side with friends when he started shivering.

'I turned up the heat in the car to 90 degrees and drove back to Brooklyn — then I got out of the car and I was freezing again,' he told the Daily News.

'My mother took my 
temperature and it was 104. When she called our family doctor, she said 
to get me to the emergency room at Mount Sinai.'

Silverman's mother, Sandra Schpoont, put him into a cab and they rushed to the Manhattan hospital, where they were greeted by emergency room staff wearing protective gear.

At first, Silverman thought his symptoms could be a recurrence of malaria, which he contracted in February.

But then on Monday, the first real scare came in.

'We have good news,' one doctor told him, according to the Daily News. 'The tests came back negative for malaria.'

Silverman knew that could only mean one thing.

'I saw people wearing these space suits and I realized they couldn’t 
rule out Ebola,' said Silverman, who next month will join Columbia University as a graduate student in international affairs, to the Daily News. 'They needed to quarantine me until 
they could confirm it wasn’t.'

Silverman's terrified family blocked off his room back home, just in case he'd left anything contaminated behind.

'It was a long wait — I felt really bad for Eric,' Schpoont told the Daily News. 'He was in isolation hooked up to all these monitors. Two days before he was riding his bike 40 miles around New York.”

Silverman's nurse, Margaret Kraus, compared the next 72 years to the night the hospital went on overdrive to house extra patients forced to evacuate another hospital during Hurricane Sandy.

'If he had the Ebola virus, we all knew how it could impact so many people’s lives,' she told the Daily News.

Then on Wednesday, the good news finally came in from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Silverman was going to be fine.

'We all had a huge sense of relief, for him and the staff,' Dr. Charles Powell, who treated Silverman, told the Daily News.

'It is a scary situation for so many reasons,' the doctor added. 'There’s a lot we don’t know, but we do know how deadly this can be. We were all worried that Ebola had arrived in New York City.'

Silverman, who lived in Africa for three months doing the Peace Corps., says he's planning on going back to Sierra Leone once the Ebola outbreak is under control.
