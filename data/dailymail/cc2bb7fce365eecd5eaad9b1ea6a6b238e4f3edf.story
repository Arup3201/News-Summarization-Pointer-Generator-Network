Obese patients and smokers face an immediate ban on routine operations according to a major NHS clinical commissioning group.

Patients in Devon will be told today that if they have a body mass index of more than 35 (morbidly obese), they will be required to lose either five per cent of their weight or reduce their BMI to under 35 before they  undergo surgery.

Smokers will have to have given up eight weeks before any planned operation in a bid to slash heath costs and improve clinical outcomes.

The North Eastern and Western Devon Clinical Commissioning Group is one of the largest groups in the country hand as almost 900,000 patients served by 130 GP practices.

In a statement it said: 'The CCG decided that for those patients undergoing hip and knee operations with a body mass index of more than 35 (morbidly obese) they patient would be required to have a BMI of under 35 or to lose five per cent of their weight before planned surgery, whichever is the lesser weight loss.'

The new restrictions will be extended to all non-urgent surgical procedures, however, it will not apply to cancer treatment or urgent cases.

The statement added: 'The CCG also confirmed that it would not be restricting IVF treatment or Caesarean sections on medical grounds at this time.

'The quit smoking and the BMI requirements will be introduced with immediate effect.'

Patients who have already been given a date for surgery will not be affected by the policy change although they will be offered support in losing weight or quitting smoking. 

Dr Tim Burke, chair of the NEW Devon CCG said: 'All of these temporary measures relate to planned operations and treatments, not those which must be done as an emergency or to save lives.

'Clinicians have carefully reviewed a number of measures, taking into account the impacts of their temporary withdrawal to decide which we will implement.

'We recognise that each patient is an individual and where their GP or consultant feels that there are exceptional circumstances we will convene a panel of clinicians to consider the case.

'We will continue to keep people informed about our decisions around the measures.'

Dr Burke said that he was being forced to curtail some services because the CCG is currently running a deficit of £14.5 million. 

The new restrictions imposed by the North Eastern and Western Devon Clinical Commissioning Group will affect all non-urgent surgical procedures, including hip and knee operations (file image) 

He said he was now going to restrict access to second hearing aids as well as certain expensive drugs. 

He said: 'Other measures encourage patients to take steps themselves to reduce their risks from surgery and to improve their outcomes, such as losing weight and stopping smoking.

'As part of the review we looked at how long a person should stop smoking for before surgery and based on that evidence we have increased the previously discussed time of six weeks to eight weeks.

'We don’t under estimate how difficult it will be for some people to lose weight or stop smoking and we will continue to support them. If they are able to do this it will also have long term health benefits for them.

'We are committed to being open about what we are considering and how the decisions are being made. We are publishing our decisions and producing information for the patients affected about the available treatment options for them.

'The CCG has a legal duty to live within its financial resources and the prioritisation of services is helping us to do that.'

It is understood that the CCG is expecting a new range of cuts.
