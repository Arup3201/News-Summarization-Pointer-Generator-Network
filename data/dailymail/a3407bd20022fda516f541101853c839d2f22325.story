The recent high-profile abandonment of two babies has prompted the NSW government to crackdown on mothers who try to hide the birth of their child and fail to register it. 

Attorney General Brad Hazzard has called on police, health and welfare officials to fix holes in the current system that allow for the birth of babies to go unregistered, the Daily Telegraph reports.

It comes after a baby boy was found alive in a drain at Quakers Hill in Sydney's west on November 23 and the body of a baby girl was found buried in the sand at Maroubra on November 30.

The NSW government will crackdown on mothers who try to hide the birth of their child following two high-profile abandonment cases, including this baby boy who was found in a drain in western Sydney

Under current laws, hospitals are required to notify the Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages within seven days of a child's birth and the parents have 60 days to notify authorities. 

Mr Hazzard said the new taskforce was about ensuring no child remained unregistered in NSW.

'The aim of the working party is to develop a consistent policy to improve the way we respond when a baby is born and not registered within 60 days,' a spokeswoman for Mr Hazzard said yesterday.

'Over experience is the overwhelming majority of parents are registering their babies within 60 days.'

The mother of the baby boy dumped in the drain has since been arrested and charged with attempted murder after giving birth at Blacktown Hospital

The taskforce, which is in the process of being set up, will include the Department of Justice, NSW Police, the health department, Family and Community Services and the Ombudsman's Office.

The Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages has technology to match hospital notifications of births with that of the parents, but it won't be up and running until the beginning of next year. 

Emails, letters and telephone calls are currently used by the registry to contact parents of babies who haven't yet been registered.

The body of a baby girl was found buried in the sand at Maroubra on November 30 just a week after the case in western Sydney

Police efforts to locate the parents of the girl found dead at Maroubra have so far found nothing, with hospitals unable to provide information about the birth

If the registry can't contact the parents, Family and Community Services are then called in.

The mother of the baby boy dumped in the drain has since been arrested and charged with attempted murder after giving birth at Blacktown Hospital.

But police efforts to locate the parents of the girl found dead at Maroubra have so far found nothing, with hospitals in the area unable to provide information about the birth.
