Attacked: Patricia Hughes, 77, said she was knocked unconscious after thieves cut through a mosquito net attached to her bedroom window and sprayed her with a chemical

A British widow claims she was gassed by armed raiders at her holiday home in Goa before they stole £25,000 of money and jewellery. 

Patricia Hughes, 77, said that she was knocked unconscious after thieves cut through a mosquito net attached to her bedroom window and sprayed her with a chemical in the town of Cavelossim, in Goa, India. 

The widow has regularly holidayed at the destination over the past 20 years after her husband Brian, 56, suffered a fatal stroke, and she has stayed in the same apartment in the town for the last five years.

On Saturday night, two weeks into her latest stay, she says thieves attacked her with the chemical spray and raided her safety deposit box. 

They stole £1,600 cash and valuable jewellery, the Express reports. 

Mrs Hughes, from Swansea, said: 'It's terrifying to think they were right by me, they took the keys off my bedside table to open the locked box which had all the money I have here. 

'When I realised they had sliced through the mosquito netting and climbed into my room with a knife in their hand right next to my bed it shook me up a little.

'It could've been so very nasty.'

The former council worker was unharmed in the incident and intends to continue her holiday despite the robbery. 

She said: 'I'm not going to run away just because of this.

Terror: On Saturday night, two weeks into her latest stay, she says thieves attacked her with the chemical spray and raided her safety deposit box 

'I don't think this was someone I know but it obviously must be someone who knows me and knows I had only just arrived and hadn't got round to putting my money in the bank.'

The crime has been reported to the Foreign Office in London.

A spokesman confirmed they were aware of an incident involving a British National on Saturday 15 November in Goa and said they were providing consular assistance.
