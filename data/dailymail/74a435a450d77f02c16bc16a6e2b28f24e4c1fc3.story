The Premier League will break extraordinary new ground this weekend when fans are taken inside the dressing room ahead of Arsenal vs Liverpool.

In a first for top-flight football, both pre-match teamtalks by the captains will be streamed live to the world from the Emirates on Saturday.

As they bid to keep track with the latest technology, the Premier League has convinced both clubs to take part.

But it was only rubber-stamped last night after the rivals agreed to a strict number of rules that will ensure neither side is left at a disadvantage.

Although the teamtalks by Per Mertesacker and Jordan Henderson will not be screened on BT Sport - who are covering the match live on TV - fans who own a smartphone will be able to tune in.

New social media tool Periscope - which was launched last week - will host both teamtalks as it bids to break into the sports market.

Arsenal and Liverpool were initially reluctant to take part in the broadcast - but Premier League chiefs have assured them it will not compromise their attempts to win the match.

Although Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers - who famously starred in the Being Liverpool documentary on Channel Five - was willing to take part, his counterpart Arsene Wenger was hesistant over fears of giving away his side's secrets.

However, a meeting between the clubs and Premier League officials has left both convinced it is a clever marketing idea as they aim to draw more fans from the United States and Asia.

Sportsmail understands that the rules agreed between the teams are:

Periscope are hoping they will have a combined 250,000 viewers for the two broadcasts which would set a new record for the app.

They have even deployed a special IT unit to ensure the broadcasts hold up with huge number of expected viewers.

If successful, they would then attempt to convince the Premier League to make it a regular feature on match days.
