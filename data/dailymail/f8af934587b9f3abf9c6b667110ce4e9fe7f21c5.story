Blackburn will try to tie their FA Cup hat-trick hero Josh King to a new contract after he did more to restore the club’s battered reputation than anyone has in recent years.

The feelgood factor returned to Ewood Park with King leading a remarkable victory against one of the Barclays Premier League’s most rugged outfits in Stoke City.

Yet the 23-year-old Norwegian is due to become a free agent in the summer and after this performance can expect a host of offers.

‘The club are in talks with Josh,’ confirmed manager Gary Bowyer after the best win of his managerial career.

‘When I took over the main aim was to keep out of the papers because the headlines were for the wrong reasons but hopefully now we are going to get some positive reports for our football.’

The irony is that King isn’t guaranteed to start in Tuesday night’s league game against Cardiff City due to the form of regular strike partners Rudy Gestede and Jordan Rhodes.

King started his career at Old Trafford and made two first-team substitute appearances before moving on to Preston, Borussia Monchengladbach, Hull and Blackburn.

After his first professional hat-trick, he said: ‘I don’t mind playing anywhere up front, right, left, middle. I just love attacking defenders. 

'I actually forgot I was meant to take the match ball home until Tony Grant, the assistant manager, reminded me on my way out.’

It was Stoke’s second consecutive 4-1 loss and midfielder Glenn Whelan labelled the performance the ‘worst I have ever seen’.

‘We didn’t want to fight or do the basics. We weren’t prepared to work hard enough,’ he said.
