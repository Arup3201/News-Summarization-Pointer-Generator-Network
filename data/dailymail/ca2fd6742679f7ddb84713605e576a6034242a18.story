A Tory MP allegedly reduced to tears by David Cameron after rebelling on Europe has announced he will not stand at the next general election.

Dudley South MP Chris Kelly is the ninth member of the 2010 intake of MPs to quit the Commons after a single term – sparking accusations that many are ‘giving up’ on the Prime Minister. It comes just days after rebel MP Douglas Carswell announced he was leaving the Tories for UKIP.

Mr Kelly denied reports in 2010 that he had burst into tears after a showdown with Mr Cameron over a vote on Europe. The MP was accused of being more scared of upsetting his millionaire father than Mr Cameron.

Veteran Tory MP Sir Tony Baldry will stand down at the next election, he announced today.

The North Oxfordshire MP, who represents the Church of England in the Commons, blamed the decision to fix the length of each Parliament.

He said: 'If I succeed in being re-elected at the forthcoming general election, given my age, most people will assume that Parliament will be my last.

'I think this creates a danger that I may be unable to be as effective as I would wish to be; and that the constituency will be distracted from more important issues by the need to choose my successor.'

Announcing his decision to step down last night, Mr Kelly said: 'I would like to thank all those who have supported me since I was selected for Dudley South in September 2007.

'I would especially like to thank all those who voted for me at the general election in May 2010 and all of the friends and supporters who helped me for that election, as well as those who have supported my efforts since.

'I am proud to have served the good people of Dudley South for the past five years.'

The Eurosceptic MP won Dudley South from Labour in 2010 with a majority of 3,856.

Fellow Tory MP Conor Burns said: 'Very disappointed my colleague Chris Kelly will not contest his Dudley seat at the next election. We are losing the wrong people.'  

Michael Dugher, Labour’s Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Kelly was ‘another Tory MP giving up on David Cameron’.

He said: ‘Confidence in the Prime Minister is collapsing even inside his own party, with MPs formerly loyal to David Cameron throwing in the towel rather than fighting on.

‘Hardworking people desperately need a government which will deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Instead we have a weak Prime Minister and a divided Tory Party turning in on itself.’

In 2010 Mr Kelly was among several anti-EU Tories subjected to a four-letter onslaught by Mr Cameron as he battled to contain a rebellion over Europe. But the Tory MP insisted he did not cry.

He told his local newspaper the Dudley News: ‘Man’s inhumanity to man and genocide is what makes me cry, not Prime Ministers.

‘There’s footage of me in the chamber completely dry eyed sat close to Bill Cash MP listening to his – and other members’ contributions – at precisely the time I was supposedly in tears or close to tears.’

Chris Kelly only entered Parliament in 2010, but has decided not to fight for re-election in 2015

Mr Kelly was among 27 Conservative MPs who defied Mr Cameron  amid reports that he was more terrified of upsetting his father, Tory donor Chris Kelly senior – a leading Thatcherite with robust views on Brussels – than his party leader.

Mr Kelly junior was being paid about £4,000 a month  for eight hours of work for his father’s truck dealership. It topped up his MP’s pay of £65,000 and helped him acquire a £30,000 BMW coupe, with his initials CDK on the number plate.

Mr Kelly joined the family firm Keltruck soon after finishing his studies and has carried on as a non-executive director after becoming MP for Dudley South at the last Election.

He resigned as a director of Keltruck Limited in April 2013. 

Mr Kelly was allegedly in a highly emotional state after he was summoned to Mr Cameron’s Commons office before the vote.

The Prime Minister told him: ‘You are making a bloody terrible mistake, Chris, it will do your career and reputation no good at all. 

'And you can bloody well forget about being a Minister.’

One MP said: ‘Cameron was effing and blinding at Chris and several others. 

'Chris took it badly. We thought he was going to defect to the Government – then he joined the rebels. The talk in the tea room was that he was more worried about upsetting his dad.’

Mr Kelly junior refused to reveal if Mr Cameron had sworn at him.

He said: ‘I was not close to tears at any stage.’ Asked if his father had intervened, he said: ‘What’s my father got to do with anything? I cast my vote according to my conscience and what is best for my constituency. That is the only thing I take into account.’

He added that it was ‘categorically untrue’ his father had made any threats, financial or otherwise.

When Mr Kelly senior was asked if he had urged his son to defy Mr Cameron in the EU vote, he said: ‘No. He is his own man and makes his own decisions.’
