DeAndre Yedlin is expected to join Tottenham Hotspur in January after the American right-back was granted a work permit.

The White Hart Lane club had agreed a four-year deal with Yedlin during the summer but he did not meet UK work permit regulations.

However, his work permit has now been approved on appeal and the signing is set to be confirmed when the transfer window reopens.

Yedlin, who is currently with the Seattle Sounders, caught the eye with impressive performances for the USA during the World Cup in Brazil.

The 21-year-old played for the Sounders against Spurs in the 3-3 friendly draw in Seattle back in July.

Yedlin had also received offers from Roma, Anderlecht and Werder Bremen but in the end opted to join Mauricio Pochettino at Spurs.
