Charged: Stanley Dishon, pictured, was indicted on Wednesday in connection with the death of his niece Jessica Dishon, who was last seen on September 10, 1999 at the family's Shepherdsville home as she got ready for school

A 55-year-old Kentucky man has been charged with kidnapping and murdering his 17-year-old niece 14 years ago.

Stanley Dishon was indicted on Wednesday in connection with the death of Jessica Dishon, who was last seen on September 10, 1999 at the family's Shepherdsville home as she got ready for school.

Her body was found beaten and strangled 17 days later in a dumping ground known as the Salt River bottoms, about seven miles from her home.

Bullitt County Sheriff David Greenwell, who was first on the scene 14 years ago, broke down in tears at a press conference as he claimed the cold case had finally been solved.

He said the investigation into Jessica's slaying was reopened six months ago based on strong tips but he refused to outline the new evidence pointing to Dishon.

However, he said he was confident indictment would stick and hoped the charges would bring closure to Jessica's family and the community, which was rocked by the tragedy.

Dishon had been serving a state sentence on sexual assault charges when he was moved to Bullitt County jail on new sex charges recently, authorities said.

The sheriff's office had identified the Dishon family's nextdoor neighbor David 'Bucky' Brooks as the prime suspect and arrested him January 18, 2001.

He was freed more than two years later after a judge declared a mistrial -- because a detective testified that Brooks had failed a lie-detector test, which is not admissible. The charges were dismissed.

Greenwell said on Wednesday he is confident the Brooks family had nothing to do with crime and that Dishon acted alone.

'As far as I'm concerned we have indicted the right person,' Greenwell said. He said Dishon has been cooperating with police.

According to Brooks' former attorney, John Spainhour, Stanley Dishon had been a person of interest in the case, but investigators chose to look at people who they thought were more involved.

Dishon occasionally lived with Jessica Dishon and her father Mike, who is his brother, before the murder, Spainhour told the Courier-Journal.

On Wednesday, Jessica's brother Michael Dishon, 27, wouldn't comment on the charges saying simply, 'We don't care who did it. We just want that person to be brought to justice.'
