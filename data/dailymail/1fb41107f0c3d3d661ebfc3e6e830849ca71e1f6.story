Sweating through 28-hour shifts in the malarial jungle of the lowlands of south-east Peru, prospectors brave the perils of collapsing earth and limb-crushing machinery to gather a few grams of gold.

Most of the wildcat miners in Madre de Dios come from impoverished Andean communities and barely earn subsistence wages for their backbreaking labour.

To ward off fatigue and avoid fatal accidents they chew coca, a mild herbal stimulant endemic to the region that is the basis of the drug cocaine.

Miners swish sands on carpets, filtering gold pieces that fall into the pool of water at their feet, in La Pampa in Peru's Madre de Dios region

An amalgam is melted to burn off the mercury, a process generally carried out with nothing to protect workers' health or capture waste or fumes

A stream of water passes above two miners known as 'Maraqueros' who remove stones and chunks of tree trunks that have been released with the aid of a rustic type of hydraulic jet known locally as a 'Chupadera'. The Chupadera aims powerful jets of water at earth walls, releasing the soils that hold the sought after flecks of gold

A miner stands next to a tube used to transport soil removed from a crater to a sluice-like contraption to filter gold. Artisanal gold miners began carving the lawless, series of ramshackle settlement out of the jungle in 2008. They are working up to the last minute, for they know they will be soon be evicted

Life is cheap in the mining camps. 
Deaths go unrecorded and the mercury they use to bind gold flecks 
compounds the risks. It doesn't just seep into the food chain. It 
poisons them and their families, too.

And
 now a new threat now looms for the estimated 20,000 wildcat miners who 
toil in a huge scar of denuded Amazon rainforest known as La Pampa, an 
area nearly three times the size of Washington, D.C.

Peru's
 government declared all informal mining illegal on April 19 and began a
 crackdown. It raided the older boomtown of Huepetuhe, dynamiting 
backhoes, trucks and generators.

Troops
 even destroyed the outboard motors of canoes used to ferry mining 
equipment across the Inambari river. In La Pampa, miners fear they are 
next. Their gasoline supplies have already been choked by authorities.

Some
 buried their equipment after the crackdown began, only to unearth it 
days later when no raid came. But come it eventually will, the 
government says, because no legal mining concessions exist in La Pampa.

A miner rests with a newspaper on top of a rustic sluice-like contraption. Engine noise is the characteristic sound of this Amazonian jungle territory nearly three times the size of Washington DC. There are no trees, only hills of moved earth and artificial ponds of brown water where gold is mined

Prisaida, 2, sits in the shallow waters of a polluted lagoon as her parents mine for gold nearby. The lagoon emerged as a result of miners bombarding the earth with jet streams of water in search of gold. It is likely to be contaminated with mercury, used to make amalgams of the gold flecks

Authorities are acting on international pressure to head off an incipient environmental catastrophe in the region.

The Amazon Conservation Association, an NGO, says the destructive mining methods raze trees, devastate habitats, contaminate waterways and endanger public health.

In Madre de Dios alone an estimated 30 to 40 tons of mercury are dumped into the environment annually, ACA claims.

The liquid metal, a potent neurotoxin, is used to amalgamate gold particles and then burned off – generally without even rudimentary technology to protect workers’ health or capture waste or fumes.

It also bleeds into the surrounding ecosystem. Mercury bioaccumulates throughout the food chain to become concentrated in top predators, such as large river fish and carnivorous birds.

The advance of the miners into the virgin forest has also led to conflict over land use rights, with many communities illegally invaded by prospectors looking for the next rich seam.

Last October, researchers using airborne mapping and satellite monitoring estimated that the area affected by illegal mining had increased 400 per cent between 1999 and 2012.

People in La Pampa say that if the authorities eradicate their livelihood, it must quickly make good on promises to provide new jobs.

'Motors are my life. I'm a mechanic. If the government comes and destroys them, then from what will I and my family live?' said Leoncio Condori.

The 51-year-old, a native of the Andes city of Cuzco, has been fixing motors in La Pampa ever since artisanal gold miners began carving out lawless, ramshackle settlements from Amazon jungle there in 2008.

It's not just miners who are threatened with economic catastrophe from the government's campaign to wipe out illegal mining operations, said a mining camp cook, who identified herself only as Gladis, fearing government retribution.

'For every miner there is a family that eats because he works,' she said.
