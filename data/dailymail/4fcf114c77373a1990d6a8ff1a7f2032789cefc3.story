From next year, children in Finland will not be compulsorily taught cursive handwriting. 

Instead of learning this skill, schools will be given the choice to teach keyboard typing in its place.

The country's education board said the change reflects how typing skills are now more relevant than handwriting, but experts claim the move could damage a child's brain development.

Instead of learning this skill, schools will be given the choice to teach keyboard typing in its place. The country's education board said the change reflects how typing skills are now more relevant than handwriting

The changes don't officially come into force until the start of next year's autumn term. 

Minna Harmanen from the National Board of Education told Savon Sanomat that 'fluent typing skills are an important national competence'.

It follows changes made to the Common Core Standards Initiative in the US, in September 2013, in which the US similarly removed cursive handwriting as a compulsory skill. 

As of last year, 43 states had adopted the standard, Maryland had endorsed it, Indiana had withdrawn, Oklahoma and South Carolina had repealed it, and the rest of the states were non-members or had not adopted it. 

North Carolina additionally passed the Back to Basics bill to reintroduce cursive into the classroom, which led to a number of complaints. 

A predominant criticism is that, while handwriting is important, cursive handwriting is no longer deemed necessary.

'Most [people] would agree that everyone should at least be able to pick up a pen or pencil and craft a message that others can read,' said Misty Adoniou, senior lecturer in language, literacy and TESL at University of Canberra. 

'But beyond legibility, does it matter how you form your letters when you hand write?'

She continued there is research linking fluent handwriting with better written compositions, 'but the key isn’t the quality, form or style of the handwriting, but rather the automaticity of the handwriting.'

Reports have found that by the age of eight, children can already type faster than they can handwrite. But, further research said that learning to write in cursive improves a person's motor and visual skills, eye-to-hand co-ordination, spatial awareness, hand and finger dexterity, cognitive function and brain development

Automaticity is the theory that the less a person has to concentrate on forming their letters correctly, the more brain space they can devote to getting their message right.

However, writing automaticity is just as easily achieved on a keyboard, and Ms Adoniou said it's more time efficient to teach a child to type than it is to teach them a particular handwriting style. 

In a recent study from Indiana University, researchers conducted brain scans on five-year-olds before and after receiving different letter-learning tasks.

In children who practiced writing letters by hand, the neural activity was more enhanced and 'adult-like' than in those who had simply looked at letters.

And, the brain’s so-called 'reading circuit' - a region of linked connections that become active when reading - was activated during handwriting, but not during typing. 

Reports have also found that by the age of eight, children can already type faster than they can handwrite.

But, as Ms Adoniou acknowledged, handwriting can play a crucial part in brain development.  

'Although the ease, speed and versatility of technology are widely acknowledged, handwriting proponents say that how we learn to write does indeed matter. 

'Research indicates that learning to write in cursive further improves students' motor and visual skills, eye-to-hand co-ordination, spatial awareness, hand and finger dexterity, cognitive function and brain development. 

'They say the physical act of handwriting also facilitates the retention of information and the flow of ideas.'

For example, in a recent study from Indiana University, researchers conducted brain scans on five-year-olds before and after receiving different letter-learning tasks.

In children who practiced writing letters by hand, the neural activity was more enhanced and 'adult-like' than in those who had simply looked at letters.

And, the brain’s so-called 'reading circuit' - a region of linked connections that become active when reading - was activated during handwriting, but not during typing. 

Graphology is the study of handwriting. 

Graphologists analyse the physical characteristics and patterns of handwriting and make assumptions about their identify, including the person's mental state, as well as personality traits.  

Writing consists of three things - movement, spacing and form - and a graphologist studies these variations and attaches interpretations to them.

Graphologist Adam Brand recently analysed the handwriting of the MailOnline Science team as part of the Signature campaign from Thomas Cook. 

Graphologist Adam Brand recently analysed the handwriting of the MailOnline Science team. He said: 'Rachel is a friendly, sociable and balanced', seen by the right slant of the script (1), close word spacing (2) and rhythmic nature. 'She has mental drive' seen by the long ‘t’ bar (3) and stubborn determination to do an accurate job', denoted by the ‘d’ structure (4) and the straight zone (5 and 6)

'Although prepared to look at the unfamiliar, represented by the high ‘i’ dot (1), Vicky is practical and likes to focus on short range projects' - seen in the low ‘t’ bars (2). 'She  is loyal (seen with close word spacing and structure (3 and 4) but wants to ensure she gets her point across' - seen with  'trumpet word endings' (5)

'We were all taught to write in a specific way when we were children at school, but it is evident that no one continues to write exactly the way they were taught and everyone’s handwriting looks different,' explained the British Institute of Graphologists. 

'The reason is that our personalities affect the way our handwriting develops after we were taught to write. 

'This is because handwriting is the pattern of our psychology expressed in symbols on the page and these symbols are as unique as our own DNA.' 

However, despite the fact it has previously been used in court cases as a form of forensic evidence, the practice is deemed controversial and has been dubbed a 'pseudoscience.' 

'Jonny is capable of determined concentration', seen by the down stroke cutting through the base line (2), 'and likes to take an intellectual approach to projects' (high upper zone at 3). 'He is unlikely to act impulsively' seen by the rising ‘m’ at (4) and is 'sensitive to criticism which motivates him to set high standards', represented by the open ‘t’ stem (6). His twisted slants (7) show he likes to verify ideas

Mr Brand's analysis said Sarah's style shows she's active, seen by a fast, right slant (1), who works well in fast-moving environments. This is represented by the right-placed 't' bar (2) and angles (3). He added that her writing falls below the line (4) suggesting she is weighed down by her responsibilities

Other points that Mr Brand noted during the analysis is that close and overlapping lines show a need to be involved in a mass of different projects. 

Ascending base lines show energy, enthusiasm and initiative, while extremely long 't' bars show a need to move forward with new ideas that come along. 

He added that small writing shows a good ability to concentrate but can also suggest an introverted person, and slant changes and a sudden upsurge in height shows impulsiveness. 

Curved, looped rhythmic writing shows altruism, friendliness and a sense of balance. 

And it pressure of the writing increases towards the end of words it symbolises increased commitment to a project as time goes on

A tall ‘k’ structure shows defiance, and if letters reach down into the lower zone that represents the area of materialism.  

In a recent study from Indiana University, researchers conducted brain scans (pictured) on 5-year-olds before and after receiving different letter-learning tasks. In children who practiced writing letters by hand, the neural activity was more enhanced and 'adult-like' than in those who had simply looked at letters

Earlier this year, LeapFrog’s learning designer Dr. Jody Sherman LeVos told MailOnline that schools are already ditching pens and paper for tablets.

She said there is an emerging focus on skills that go beyond the core curriculum, including skills such as collaboration, grit and perseverance, music and creativity, and problem solving skills.

‘Technology can encourage and support numerous child development and educational objectives, such as physical activity and health,' explained Dr LeVos.

'And there is a body of research supporting the notion that children learn best when they’re having fun.'

But as Ms Adoniou concluded: 'With so many things to do in a school day, it is hard to see why dedicated handwriting lessons persist.

'No matter how standardised we attempt to make handwriting, we all end up with our own style. 

'So perhaps there are better things to do in the school day than have children complete pages of handwriting exercises. 

'Perhaps we’d do just as well to let children play with drawing and writing implements and find their own style.'
