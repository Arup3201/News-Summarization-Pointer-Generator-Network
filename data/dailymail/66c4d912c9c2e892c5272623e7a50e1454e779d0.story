Alan Irvine was fighting for his job from day one. Supporters frustrated with a season of turmoil on and off the pitch were vocal in criticising the appointment of a man sacked from his two previous stints as manager, at Sheffield Wednesday and Preston North End.

Irvine, renowned as an excellent football coach, will be bitterly disappointed he failed to last longer than 22 games in charge of West Bromwich Albion.

But a record of five wins and 11 losses was viewed as unpalatable by chairman Jeremy Peace, whose instinct to pull the trigger decisively sees him about to embark on a fourth head coach in little more than a year.

Steve Clarke was sacked on December 14, 2013, while Pepe Mel left the Hawthorns in May after Albion finished one place above the relegation zone.

Stability seems a distant planet for this club right now.

The revolving door is not just used by the employee charged with training the squad and picking the team – for that is the role of head coach in West Brom’s continental structure.

The head-spinning extends to those on the pitch. A summer flurry like no other saw 10 players leave and 11 join. At times signings appeared slapdash. A significant number have failed to impress.

Chief among them is record purchase Brown Ideye, who cost £10million but has scored only twice in all competitions and looked off the pace.

Giorgos Samaras, Jason Davidson, Sebastian Blanco and Chris Baird have all made little impression, with the jury still out on Cristian Gamboa and Silverstre Varela.

Irvine had a hand in all these moves to varying degrees but is not intimately involved on the recruitment side. Recently he admitted to not stepping foot in the recruitment room since the summer.

The system Albion use on that front needs scrutiny. Technical director Terry Burton was appointed from Arsenal last summer tasked with bringing in a new head coach and overseeing transfers.

But his previous role was not dedicated to that and he started at West Brom playing catch-up. That left the club behind others and they are paying the price now.

Sporting director Richard Garlick sorts contracts and finances. Everyone is answerable to Peace.

Irvine was popular with players who respected his training methods – described as varied and interesting. But perhaps, to his cost, he was too nice – unable to provoke performances on matchdays.

Even though Irvine would work his fingers to the bone – in contrast to Mel, for example – this eventuality was all too predictable.

Peace grew increasingly concerned as results tailed off, with the current run at seven defeats in nine matches. Irvine could have been sent packing before the Aston Villa match but got a win courtesy of Craig Gardner’s late strike.

At Irvine’s peak during the 4-0 win over Burnley supporters chanted his name, but it was all too fleeting. The viciousness of the abuse aimed his way after the 2-0 defeat at Stoke on Sunday was impossible to ride out, Peace determined.

Peace must make his next appointment work. The turbulent nature of the Hawthorns dugout needs to cease.

Tim Sherwood, who came very close to getting the job after Mel, is the frontrunner. Talks collapsed last summer over his wage demands and his desire to bring in staff of Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey. Those hurdles could be overcome this time.

Sherwood would work within West Brom’s structure but provide a more outspoken voice to Irvine. It would be interesting to see how he functions in the role.

Tony Pulis is another option and a surer bet in the Premier League. Although whether the former Stoke and Crystal Palace manager would agree to West Brom’s model remains to be seen.

Assistant head coaches Rob Kelly and Keith Downing will take charge for the New Year’s Day clash at West Ham but their long term futures remain uncertain.

Late on Monday night West Brom released a statement. Tellingly, a replacement is expected by the weekend.

Irvine was praised by the club for his work to bring on Saido Berahino and Craig Dawson the imperative of staying in the top division was underlined too.

Whoever comes next will understand that necessity.
