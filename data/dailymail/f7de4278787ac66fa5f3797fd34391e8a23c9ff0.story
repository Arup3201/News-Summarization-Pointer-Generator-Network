The wife at the center of a nasty divorce with her investment banker husband who makes $7 million a year at Jefferies and Company in New York City is not just revealing the details of their now very public sex life in court documents, but also her and her husband's rampant drug use.

In an affidavit filed by Christina Di Mauro Kelly, she describes the last 12 years of marriage with her husband Sage as a nonstop drugfest, complete with cocaine, heroin, Molly, Ketamine, ecstasy and a whole lot of alcohol.

In fact, she claims her husband's drug use was so frequent, he had a special high end drug dealer who only worked with clients purchasing 'substantial quantities of illegal drugs.'

Children's welfare: Christina claims she and her husband did drugs while their children were present in their apartment in the city and their Hamptons vacation home

Christina says her husband kept cocaine and Molly around both their Manhattan apartment and Sag Harbor house at all times, with both parties using while their children, ages 10 and 6, were home, and with Sage storing the drugs in 'bags' or 'squirt bottles designed and manufactured to contain a nasal spray.'

That's not all her snorted either according to Christina, who recalls one time when her husband snorted heroin at a club in the Hamptons while they were dating.

She says afterwards he became 'disoriented' and then tried to walk home 'barefoot.'

Soon he moved on to other drugs claims Christina, among them Ketamine and mushrooms.

He had a "magic mushroom party" at their house in Sag Harbor in 2011, and consumed so many of the hallucinogenics that she says they hid the bag from him.

That did not stop him however according to Christina. 

She says in court papers, 'We were all stunned, therefore, at the sight of Sage– with his own blood purposefully smeared on his face in several long lines– walking towards us outside the home.

'After exclaiming, "I found the bag!," Sage popped yet another mushroom into his mouth.'

Then there was the time he did Ketamine and, again according to Christina, demanded to hold their daughter for several hours after getting depressed and going in to a K-hole.

She says Sage 'desperately clung to [then 3-year-old daughter] Cameron for several hours, causing Cameron to have palpable feelings of fear for her father's well-being.'

She also provided the court with photos that claim to show a giant mound of cocaine he consumed with a friend and Sage showing off a vial of cocaine during a party they had at their apartment while their daughters were home.

Denying claims: Sage has said of these claims, 'While [she] and I used recreational drugs on occasion at certain social events in the past, the Wolf of Wall Street tale she tells this court is a work of fiction'

One of her last claims is a wild trip Sage took to Las Vegas to celebrate the 'Bachelor Party' of Mark Hosny, a weekend that she seems to imply was filled with drugs, booze and hookers. 

'In May 2014, defendant and several of Defendant's drug cohorts engaged in a several-day, illegal "drugfest" in Las Vegas, Nevada in which they ingested various illegal substances, notably cocaine, and engaged in numerous forms of wild behavior, including but not limited to, engagement in sexual relations with prostitutes,' the papers claim.

She also names a host of men who also did cocaine and other drugs with her husband, from younger men about town in NYC to big name execs and bankers. 

Mr Kelly said in paper filed this summer of his soon to be ex-wife's claims, 'While [she] and I used recreational drugs on occasion at certain social events in the past, the Wolf of Wall Street tale she tells this court is a work of fiction.' 

Christina says she is now sober, attending meetings on a daily basis, and is dedicated to getting clean.
