Middlesex’s Dom Inglot went out of the Australian Open doubles quarter final today, but there was an impressive upset registered in the girl’s singles by Britain’s Katie Swan.

Inglot and Romanian partner Florin Mergea were unable to follow up their shock defeat of the Bryan brothers, going down 6-4, 7-6 (4) to Jean-Julien Roger of Holland and Mergea’s fellow Romanian Horia Tecau.

But Swann, a 15 year-old from Bristol, perked up the current bleak landscape of GB junior tennis by knocking out the top seed in the juniors, China’s Shilin Xu, 6-2, 6-2, mastering the windy conditions on the outside courts far better than her opponent.

With no British boys good enough to make the boys event Swan, who trains most of the time in Kansas, showed her promise by knocking out the world junior No 2 to make the quarter finals.

While by no means all the world’s top under eighteens play in this event, it was still a creditable result for Swan, one of three GB entrants in the girls’ event.
