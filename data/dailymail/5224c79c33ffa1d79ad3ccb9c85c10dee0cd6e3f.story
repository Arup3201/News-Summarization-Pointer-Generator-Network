Whether it's munching champagne truffles in Switzerland, or indulging in Mary Pralines in Belgium, chocolate lovers are spoilt for choice when it comes to travel.

But for real aficionados, finding the off-the-beaten-track cafes, or the places where the locals shop isn't always easy.

With that in mind, Love Home Swap has compiled this Chocolate Lover's Travel Guide - showcasing the world's most tempting must-visit destinations.

Cailler Dessert on the Chocolate Train in Switzerland gets a mention as does the apple strudel hot chocolate at the Chocolate House in Luxembourg.

Further afield there's Hershey's s'mores in Hersheypark in Pennsylvania, and chocolate fried chicken at Choco Chicken in LA.
