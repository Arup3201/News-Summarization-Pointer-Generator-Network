The Federal Aviation Administration is 'looking into allegations' that pilots on Justin Bieber's chartered plane were forced to wear oxygen masks because the star and his entourage smoked so much marijuana.

The aviation regulator also revealed today it would investigate claims that Bieber and his 38-year-old father Jeremy 'extremely verbally abused' a flight attendant until she was forced to hide in the cockpit.

Bieber, 19, his dad and 10 friends traveled on the leased jet from Ontario, Canada, to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey last Friday ahead of the Superbowl.

Accused: When Justin Bieber, pictured in New York on Monday, flew a 
private jet from Canada to New York City to watch the Superbowl he 
allegedly smoked to much marijuana on the plane the pilots had to wear 
oxygen masks

Despite several warnings, the singer and his father Jeremy would not stop verbally abusing the flight attendant, and she eventually hid in cockpit with the pilots to avoid the passengers.

‘The captain of the flight stated that he warned the passengers, including Bieber, on several occasions to stop smoking marijuana,’ the official report of the incident, obtained by NBC News, reads.

‘The captain also stated he needed to request that the passengers stop their harassing behavior toward the flight attendant and after several warnings asked the flight attendant to stay with him near the cockpit to avoid any further abuse.’

The New York Post reported that police detected 'a strong odor of pot' and sent drug sniffing-dogs on board.

According to a TMZ report,
 the singer was flagged by U.S. Customs officials upon landing in New 
Jersey because he has two criminal cases pending in Florida and in his 
native Canada. 

On the morning after the jet was searched, Justin Bieber was spotted out in NYC posing for pictures with his adoring fans in the snow

In trouble again? Justin Bieber, seen here on Wednesday, may have once again come under suspicion for using drugs

Under FAA regulations, 'No person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crew member in the performance of the crew member's duties aboard an aircraft', CNN reported.

Under a civil statute, violators face penalties of $11,000 to $27,500, the FAA said.

Under a criminal statute, violators face a maximum of 20 years in prison and fines up to $250,000.

CNN reported the agency declined to say whether they were alerted by complaints from the pilots, by media reports, or the investigating officers.

News of the latest incident tops off a week full of legal trouble for the Canadian star.

Last week, he turned himself into Toronto authorities after being charged with assault.

TMZ reported that the fight with the limo driver began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up.

The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself.

The driver swatted his hand away and then it erupted into a full-on smack fest as Bieber then hit the driver in the head multiple times.

He already faces a charge of driving under the influence after getting caught drag racing in Miami.

Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, resisting arrest without violence and driving without a valid license in the Miami case.

A preliminary toxicology report released last week showed that he tested positive for marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax.

Bieber told police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken a prescription drug, saying that his mother gave him the medication.

Bad week: Bieber was arrested for DUI in Miami last Thursday (pictured) and turned himself in on assault charges in Canada on Wednesday, but also has outstanding vandalism charges against him in California

His father was with him while they were in Florida and was at his side in Canada on Wednesday.

Late Thursday, Bieber posted a photo of his father, Jeremy, with a praise-filled caption.

'I have the greatest Dad in the world. He's taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my superhero,' he wrote on his Instagram photo.

In California, the singer remains under investigation for an egg-tossing incident that left his neighbor's house with thousands of dollars in damage.

If Bieber is charged in that case, a California judge may look at him more harshly in light of the Florida and Toronto cases, said Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles.

Bieber has not addressed the vandalism claim in California, and his attorney Howard Weitzman has said the singer's legal team believes their client is innocent in the Toronto case.

His court date for the Miami DUI incident has been set to March 3, two days after he turns 20.

A Miami-Dade County judge set trial for the three misdemeanors; driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an invalid license.

Bieber's lawyers have already filed a written plea of not guilty and initial trial dates are often delayed.
