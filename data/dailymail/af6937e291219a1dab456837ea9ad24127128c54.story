Jose Mourinho insists he has no regrets over his touchline spat with Roy Keane and will continue to antagonise opposition benches by attempting to shake hands before the final whistle.

Aston Villa assistant manager Keane claimed a Sunday league boss would have floored Mourinho if he had done that.

Mourinho said: ‘First I want to say that I appreciate the comments (from Keane), I think that they are both two great examples of polite and well educated people. Because I am a humble guy trying to learn every day. I appreciate their comments.

Lambert refused to shake Mourinho's hand and couldn't understand why the Chelsea manager was leaving the Stamford Bridge dugout before the full-time had been blown

Assistant manager Roy Keane was in no mood to get involved in any pleasantries with Mourinho either 

Asked if he would understand why people would be upset: ‘No’.

Asked if he would do it again, he replied: ‘Yes’. 

A week after the victory over Villa, Mourinho clashed with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger on the touchline during Chelsea's 2-0 win over the Gunners.

Having initially claimed he had nothing to apologise for, Wenger has since told French TV he 'regrets' the incident.

Asked whether he was pleased with the apology, Mourinho replied: 'I have no reaction. No reaction.

'I gave you my reaction after the match, saying nothing had happened. The reaction from everyone else was saying nothing had happened.'

Meanwhile, Mourinho dismissed Neil Warnock's claims comparing him to the late great Brian Clough.

The Crystal Palace boss believes the 'Special One' is cut from the same cloth as the former Nottingham Forest manager.

Admitting he was flattered, Mourinho said: 'I think there is no comparison. Mr Clough is a legend in English football. What he did, especially with Nottingham Forest, stays forever. He's a real legend. 

'I think it's a big loss for English football that he went so early. If Neil makes that comment, obviously it makes me proud, but I think the legacy of Mr Clough has no comparison here.'

Chelsea - the current Premier League leaders with six wins and a draw from the opening seven matches - travel to Selhurst Park on Saturday.
