If you have £18million to spare and could do with a little more space, how about buying your own Cotswold village?

The beautiful hamlet of Little Rollright, less than three miles outside Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, boasts a Grade II-listed ten-bedroom manor, a Grade II-listed three bedroom rectory, and five additional cottages lying in an estate of 509 acres.

Everything bar the Chapel is included in the sale of the village, which was previously owned by Oxford University's Lincoln College, and lies close to the megalithic monument, the Rollright Stones.

Up for grabs (if you've got the cash): The picturesque hamlet of Little Rollright, less than three miles outside Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, is for sale for £18million

The big house: The village is dominated by this Grade II-listed manor house, which has its origins in the 17th century and has ten bedrooms

Plenty of room: The dining room at the historic manor house has a huge open fire, stone-flagged floor, and large sash windows with views onto open countryside

It is dominated by a stone-built manor house, which dates back to the 17th century, since when it has been added to and modernised and turned into a substantial family home.

The manor has a large kitchen and family room with windows on three sides and French doors opening onto a south-facing terrace.  There are ten bedrooms, a cinema, playroom, wine cellar, study, dining room, and a lift which provides access to the lower ground, ground and first floors.

As well as the main house, Little Rollright also comes with a Grade II listed three-bedroom rectory, and five additional cottages.

There are a number of traditional barns and outbuildings within the 509 acre estate. The land is currently made up of 82 acres of pastoral and 332 acres of arable farming and there are also 62 acres of woodland and a lake.

The only thing which isn’t thrown in as part of the deal is the village chapel, which is owned by the Church of England.

Little Rollright, which also has extensive farmland and a lake, lies between the picturesque Cotswold towns of Chipping Norton and Moreton-in-Marsh.

It is only a few miles from the Four Shires Stone, which is the historic meeting point of Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire.

The village is the closest village to the megalithic monuments of the Rollright Stones, which are thought to be older than Stonehenge and are believed go back more than 4,500 years.

The sale of the village, which is being handled by upmarket estate agents Savills, includes everything - such as this lake - bar the Chapel, which is owned by the church

Also included: This Grade II-listed rectory is made of pretty local stone and has three bedrooms. Five cottages are also included in the price

The hamlet of Little Rollright lies near the ancient Rollright Stones, the origins of which remain unclear despite the efforts of several antiquarians

Additional accommodation: The pretty hamlet, which was once owned by Oxford University's Lincoln College, also comes with five cottages built from local stone

The village of Little Rollright used to be owned by Oxford University's Lincoln College, but has been owned by an anonymous British person for the last ten years

The church of St Philip in Little Rollright is the only building in the pretty Oxfordshire hamlet which is not for sale

If your budget for a new home is £18million but you'd rather stay within the M25, how about this detached house in sought-after Hampstead?

Set on the lower slopes of Hampstead Village, Greenaway Gardens is considered the most prestigious road in the area, and this house, currently on the market with Savills, is one of the best.

For £17,950,000 it offers 8,000sq ft , six bedroom suites, a 500-bottle wine cellar and 135ft west-facing garden designed by Chelsea Gold Medal winning designer, Bunny Guinness.

You'll be closer to the shops, and probably won't get snowed in in the winter, but unlike Little Rollright, you might bump into your neighbours.

They consist of a Neolithic stone circle known as ‘The Kings Men’ and a monolith known as ‘The Kings Stone’, with a further group of upright stones known as ‘The Whispering Knights’ which are believed to guard a 5,000 year old burial chamber.

Chipping Norton, known as Chippy by locals, is famous for the media and politics set who live around it.  Prime Minister, David Cameron, Top Gear presenter, Jeremy Clarkson, and former Blur bassist, Alex James, are among the celebrities with homes nearby.

Other neighbours include JCB heirs, the Bamfords, who have an organic farm at Daylesford, former tabloid editor Rebekah Brooks, and PR supremo, Matthew Freud and his wife, Elisabeth Murdoch.

This house in Greenaway Gardens, Hampstead, is for sale for just under £18million

Little Rollright has been owned by an anonymous Brit for the past decade, and has gone on the market with Savills - at £18million, it is still £3million cheaper than a three-bedroom flat in One Hyde Park, central London.

Giles Lawton, of Savills, said: 'It is a first for me, to be selling a village in the Cotswolds. It is a very special place and you would struggle to find something similar.

'The main home was a manor farmhouse and the owner has added a wing which was designed by Robert Adam.

'It is now a much more substantial home which has been beautifully done and really adds to the village.

'The old 
rectory is a very pretty place and then you have the cottages as well. 
It is very rare to have a village for sale and it would suit anyone who 
could afford it.

'It really is a wonderful place and we have already had a number of calls.'

The
 village dates back to at least 1086, when it featured in the Domesday 
Book in the Shipton Hundred.  Then it had 17 households, made up of 12 
villagers, three smallholders and two slaves

Little
 known because of its isolated position, it lies tucked between hills at
 the end of a permissive road.  But for those who can afford it, Little 
Rollright also represents a business opportunity, as much of the land 
could be rented out.

Research
 from Knight Frank shows the average value of English farmland rose by 
almost 6.5 per cent on the first three months of the year.

It
 now stands at £7,324 per acre - the first time prices have broken the 
£7,000 per acre barrier. In the area around Little Rollright, land costs
 £10,000 per acre.

The most expensive country home sold this year was Shakenhurst, in Herefordshire which went for around £16 million.

The drawing room at Little Rollright's manor house boasts a large bay window, wooden flooring and elegant fireplace, as well as original cornicing and picture rails

Glorious: The hamlet offers buyers with a spare £18million English countryside living at its most picturesque

Impressive space: There is also an orangery, where the new residents can while away the day gazing at their own rolling acres

Stunning countryside (and it looks like you'll get good phone reception, too): Little Rollright estate comes with 509 acres of Oxfordshire, including 62 acres of woodland

Privacy: Tucked away in the Cotswold countryside, the hamlet of Little Rollright would suit a buyer looking to hide away from the public gaze

Tranquil: The hamlet is an oasis of peace, but it has good transport links to London via mainline train services and the M40

Lying just outside the village of Long Compton, on the border between Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, the Rollright Stones date back to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, but despite several studies into the subject, their original purpose is still a mystery.

Consisting of three monuments made 
from oolitic limestone, they comprise the Whispering Knights, the King's
 Men and the King Stone - and are thought to be older than Stonehenge.

The
 Whispering Knights is a large dolmen, a 5,000-year-old stone burial 
chamber thought to have been part of a Neolithic long barrow.

The
 King's Men is a stone circle of 77 lumps of limestone dating back to 
the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and the King Stone is one 
strangely-shaped stone, likened by some to a seal balancing a ball on its 
nose.

This owes its shape to 19th century drovers who chipped small 
pieces off it to guard against the Devil.

The Rollright Stones date back around 5,000 years and comprise three stone monuments: The Whispering Knights, the King's Men (pictured) and the King Stone

The name Rollright is thought to derive from the Old English 'hrolla landriht', meaning the land of Hrolla, but there are few facts known about the stones.

While local legends suggested the stones were a king and his knights who were turned to stone by a witch, antiquarians in the 17th and 18th century suggested more feasible theories.

Writing in 1743, antiquarian William Stukeley thought that they would have been part of a Druidic temple, while others suggested they were a memorial for Rollo the Dane.
