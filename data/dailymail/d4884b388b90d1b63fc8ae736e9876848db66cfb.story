National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has revealed secrets about how British spy chiefs listen in on suspected terrorists

Edward 
Snowden has revealed so much about how British spies work he has left the UK wide open to ­Al Qaeda attacks, it was reported today.

Intelligence chiefs believe terrorists have changed their methods after the whistleblower exposed how GCHQ was listening in on them.

Britain's spy bosses have already warned he put agents' lives at risk by passing secrets to Russian president Vladimir Putin in return for sanctuary.

But now Government sources say MI5 and
 MI6 have lost their digital advantage, which allowed them to detect and 
foil terror plots.

A senior Whitehall source told the Sunday People: 'Parts of the radar have gone dark and that is very worrying. Snowden has ­committed the worst kind of treachery.'

Snowden, 
30, became one of the world’s most wanted men last June when he broke 
cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents from the
 U.S. National Security Agency.

He
 leaked details of attempts by state spy agencies – including Britain’s 
GCHQ – to illegally view citizens’ private information.

Snowden also claimed internet history, emails, text messages, calls and passwords were harvested.

And he made the highly damaging revelation that the U.S. had hacked 
Chinese computers and the communications of allies such as Germany and 
France.

The
 defence contractor, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence 
centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he 
could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in U.S. 
history, on a par with WikiLeaks whistleblower Bradley Manning.

Snowden is now stranded in Moscow as a fugitive after America took away his passport.

In
 the past, GCHQ agents could listen in as terrorists used email, in-game
 communication, social networking and chat-rooms to communicate.

Spy chiefs say Edward Snowden has left Britain wide open to terrorist attack. Pictured here is the number 30 double-decker bus in Tavistock Square which was destroyed by a terrorist bomb on 7/7

By analysing their propaganda, travel arrangements, money movements and attempts to ­radicalise individuals, Britain's spooks were able to build up a picture of their activities.

But Snowden revealed the UK was monitoring 
communications on a vast scale and claimed intelligence agencies were 
able to ­'listen' to millions of personal internet messages by using 
GCHQ's Tempora programme.

Snowden claims he acted after becoming 
convinced the US  government’s actions were a ‘threat to democracy’.

He 
fled to Hong Kong, then Moscow, where he was granted asylum and now 
lives in a secret location. Much of the stolen information was revealed by the Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post.

But there are mounting suspicions Snowden had been recruited – unwittingly or not – by foreign agents.

Intelligence chiefs believe he is now a ‘puppet' passing details of military capabilities, operations and tactics to Putin's henchmen, although he denies taking any classified material to Russia.
