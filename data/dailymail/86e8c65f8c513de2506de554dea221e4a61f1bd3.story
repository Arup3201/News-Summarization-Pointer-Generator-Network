A Russian actor has been 'outed' by Twitter addressing public meetings in Ukraine pretending to be an elected politician.

In a plot that could have come from the pen of Jack Higgins, Anton Kosenko claimed to be a 'People's Deputy' from the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk.

Kosenko was addressing a public meeting in Gorlovka, in eastern Ukraine when local journalists became suspicious and discovered that he was an actor from Moscow.

The actor, who claims on his agent's website that he is willing to perform in any country, addressed the crowd in central Gorlovka on Thursday afternoon.

According to eyewitnesses, Kosenko appeared confident while answering questions, claiming the People's Republic of Donetsk only wanted a referendum to split from Ukraine and join with Russia.

Small separatist groups have sprung up all over eastern Ukraine, looking to destabalise the country.

Pro-Russian activists have seized government buildings in 10 cities in eastern Ukraine.

Denis Pushilin, a spokesman of the self-appointed Donetsk People's Republic, told reporters that the insurgents do not recognise the Ukrainian government as legitimate.

Ukraine and Russia on Thursday agreed to take tentative steps toward calming tensions along their shared border after more than a month of bloodshed.

Mr Pushilin said he wanted a referendum that would allow 'self-determination of the people'.

On Thursday, thousands gathered at peaceful demonstrations in at least four eastern cities to denounce Russia for its perceived meddling in Ukrainian affairs. Political developments in eastern Ukraine have for weeks been dominated by a small but vocal and armed opposition to the interim government in Kiev.
