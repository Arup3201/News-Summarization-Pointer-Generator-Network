RuneScape, the world’s most popular free-to-play MMO adventure, is having a summer facelift and will be released on July 22.

RuneScape 3 will see a massive leap forward in technology, with a new fully HTML5 engine, improved graphics, longer draw distances, new audio, new design features and a world changing content update as the game moves into a new age.

Set in a richly detailed, medieval fantasy world, RuneScape’s traditional storytelling proudly draws its inspiration from classic role-playing games. 

It offers a fully featured free-to-play game, with a popular subscription option of even greater scale and ambition, both running directly within almost any computer’s browser.

Free's a crowd: With 200 million members the RuneScape update is likely to be receive a warm welcome

RuneScape’s distinctive role-playing style rewards players who think strategically and play smartly, resulting in more than 200million subscriptions to the game worldwide.

Thanks to its character-class-free skill system and elective gameplay, there are no limits to the hero players can become, no quest you cannot complete and no requirement to collaborate with others or face them in player-versus-player combat unless you so choose.

Full details of the update remain a closely guarded secret but RuneScape’s Executive Producer, Phil Mansell gave the community a teaser of what’s to come, saying, ‘RuneScape 3 is a massive update to RuneScape building on 12 years of content to make improvements on all fronts. RuneScape 3 is going to run faster, look better and feel so much more immersive.’
