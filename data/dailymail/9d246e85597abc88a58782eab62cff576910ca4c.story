A young couple who violently attempted to extort money from an amateur glamour photographer have been jailed for a total of nine years.

Garry Faulds, 21, and his fiancée Laura Colquhoun, 17, hatched a plot to force their middle-aged victim to give them hundreds of pounds or they would expose his allegedly sleazy lifestyle.

The High Court in Edinburgh heard how the man, who is in his 50s and cannot be named for legal reasons, took photographs of aspiring model Colquhoun at his home over the course of a year.

It was claimed that she had repeatedly performed a sex act on him and was receiving £150 per photo session.

But just before one sitting, the teenager allowed her boyfriend – dressed in a balaclava and boiler suit – to enter the local government employee’s Edinburgh house.

Once inside, Faulds bound the man’s arms, legs and mouth with tape before threatening him with a gas canister, repeatedly striking him and threatening him by claiming to be a member of an Ulster loyalist terror group who could do him serious harm.

Faulds also said he would tell the man’s employer that he was taking illegal photographs of underage girls.

Yesterday, temporary judge Paul 
Arthurson, QC, sentenced Faulds to six years in prison.

His girlfriend 
wept as she was handed three years’ detention.

Judge Arthurson said: ‘Given the extremely serious nature of the offence, which must have been truly terrifying for the complainer who was in own home, custodial sentences are inevitable.’

Last month, Faulds and Colquhoun, of Paisley, Renfrewshire, were convicted of robbing, assaulting and threatening to extort cash from the man on August 23 last year. Sentence was deferred until yesterday for reports.

The man, who works in a senior capacity for a local authority, has never been charged or prosecuted in connection with the allegations made by Faulds.

During the trial, the victim told how he had met Colquhoun in 2012 and had conducted a number of photo shoots with her.

Recalling the day of the attack, he said: ‘When I walked into the hall, there was a guy dressed in a balaclava with the eyes cut out. He was wearing a blue jump suit.

'He came towards me and he tried to overpower me. I fell backwards. I was screaming “help”.

'I was shouting as loudly as I could.

‘He sat there for a period of time presumably just to frighten me and I must say it was quite effective.’

The court heard that the intruder tried to access the photographer’s online bank account but failed.

The couple stole £800 and tried to extort another £500 from him.

Yesterday, Faulds’s advocate John McElroy said: ‘Mr Faulds regrets his actions. To paraphrase the words to a popular pop song, if he could turn back time, he would.’

Colquhoun’s solicitor advocate Liam O’Donnell said: ‘Social workers describe her as somebody who is naive.

'She made a seriously poor decision. She was very much the minor actor in the flat.

'The report describes her as being a vulnerable young woman who is keen to do well but is easily led.’
