To hear you have been badly behaved can be distressing enough for a child, but to hear it from Father Christmas himself is enough to upset anyone.

That's what happened to Tyler, 8, and Freya, 4, after receiving a letter from 'Santa' telling them that they were on the naughty list - and might not be receiving any presents.

Laura Cole, from Epsom in Surrey, devised the elaborate plan to encourage her  children to behave on the run up to Christmas.

The married mother-of-three wrote a letter posing as Santa Claus, addressed it to two of her children Tyler, Freya, but not Logan, who is only one, and filmed Tyler reading it out loud. 

In the footage, the young boy can be heard reading how Father Christmas had been 'watching' them for 'two weeks' and was 'certain' that both Tyler and Freya would be on his 'naughty list'.

'You have not been good children,' he writes and gives them '13 sleeps' to turn the situation around.

'If you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents I have for you both,' he ends. 

Tyler and his younger sister Freya looked crushed in the video, as the boy's voice quivers as he reads out the letter.

As he is reading, the little blonde-haired girl, dressed in a pink dressing gown, hugs her legs and looks upset, saying: 'We can't be on his naughty list!'

He continues reading as the Freya cries in the background, rubbing her eyes.

The offending letter was typed up by the children's mother and put in a stocking by the chimney

Dear Tyler and Freya,

I have been watching you for the last few weeks and I am certain that you will both be on my naughty list. You have not been good children.

I can see you have been fighting with each other and not treating each other well. This has made me feel extremely disappointed.

I am also not impressed with the lack of listening you do Freya and the attitude you have at the moment Tyler.

You have 13 sleeps to change this. I will be watching you both very very closely in a hope I can change you to the nice list.

If you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents I have for you both.

Remember only good children are on the nice list. I hope to see you on Christmas Eve.

At the end of the letter, Tyler and his sister look up at their mother, and the little boy throws the the piece of paper on the floor sobbing: 'What are you looking at us like that for - it makes me upset!

The mother says: 'You have 13 days to improve.'

To which Tyler says, indicating to his sister: 'I know, but she keeps annoying me!

'And I can't just stop her,' he adds, his face trembling and his arms crossed in front of him.

'We can work on this together,' the mother tells them, to which Freya says: 'I don't want to be on the naughty list.'

Laura, who lives with her husband Dennis, 32, said in her defence: 'From the moment they wake up, to the moment they go to sleep they’re fighting with each other, arguing and annoying one another.

'I wrote the letter and put it in the stocking that is hanging on the chimney, Freya was so excited when she found it and came running in at quarter to six, "mummy, mummy, a letter from Santa".

'Tyler opened the letter and that’s when I started filming. It’s not that I didn’t think he would take it seriously, but I just thought he’d brush it off.

Upset: Tyler starts to cry and his little sister Freya wipes her eyes after hearing the news

'When he started crying I felt like crying with him but I was just trying to focus on saying encouraging things about their behaviour.

'After reading the letter they were amazing, like angels, Tyler helped Freya get dressed and even held her hand on the way to school which was a big improvement. 

'Usually you have to tell Freya 10 times to get dressed, but that morning I only had to ask her once.

'I do feel bad though, and when we got to school I went in to talk to the teacher to tell her what I’d done in case he got upset in class!'

Laura, who works for Crystal Ski, said the letter has had the desired effect.

'He's always watching': Laura with Dennis and their three children Logan, Tyler and Freya visiting Santa

'One day on and their behaviour has been amazing - completely different to before they received the letter,' she said.

'They normally fight like cat and dog from the minute they wake up, but this morning Tyler helped Freya get dressed and walk her to school. And after school they played nicely together - they even wrote their Christmas cards together.

'We have left the letter from Santa on the side so they can see it.

'If they start to argue, we point to it and say "remember, he's always watching".

'My husband wasn't there when Tyler read out the letter, but the next morning they came and told him about it. My husband told them that they need to buck their ideas up.'
