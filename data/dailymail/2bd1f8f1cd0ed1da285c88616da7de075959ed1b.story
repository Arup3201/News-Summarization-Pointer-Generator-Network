Probiotic supplements help to boost Vitamin D levels, according to new research.

A study found that a taking a probiotic supplement boosted levels of the vitamin by more than 25 per cent.

It is the first evidence that probiotics play a role in maintaining levels of the bone-strengthening nutrient.

Taking a probiotic supplement boosts a person's levels of Vitamin D - the sunshine vitamin - by more than 25 per cent

Previous studies have shown the effect of the particular strain of a probiotic, called Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242, on 
cholesterol reduction, but its effect on the absorption of fat-soluble 
vitamins such as Vitamin D was unknown.

Researchers investigated the effects of the probiotics after a supplement had been taken by a group of adults for nine weeks.

They tested levels of Vitamin D by monitoring levels ofÂ  25-hydroxyvitamin D in the blood.

Vitamin D levels are of increasing concern as the numbers of children developing rickets, and the number of adults developing osteoporosis, increases.

Insufficient Vitamin D contributes to these conditions by reducing calcium absorption, and by in turn weakening the bones.

Researchers are also beginning to discover links between Vitamin D levels and protection 
against heart disease, autoimmune diseases and diabetes.

A variety of factors 
may reduce Vitamin D absorption, including limited exposure to sunlight,
dark skin, obesity, and problems with absorption or ability to convert Vitamin D to its active form.

'This study is adding to the body 
of knowledge on the microbiome (the community of bacteria in the gut) command and its role in human health,' said Dr 
Jones, lead study author and chief scientific officer at probiotic company Micropharma 
Limited.

'Although it has long been known that the gastrointestinal 
tract plays an active role in the absorption of Vitamin D, these 
findings showing improved Vitamin D status in response to an orally 
delivered probiotic are a first, and will inform the development of new 
products that may be beneficial for people with low Vitamin D levels.'

The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.
