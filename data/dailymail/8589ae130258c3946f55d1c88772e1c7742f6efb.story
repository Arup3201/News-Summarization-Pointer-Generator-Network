He has been seen in toast, pancakes, crisps and even ice cream.

Now, with Easter just a few days away, a California couple has been shocked by the ‘miraculous’ appearance of Jesus Christ... on their pine dining table.

Jaimie Beebe, 37, a casting director from Los Angeles, said: ‘We were having dinner with some friends when we noticed it. It just appeared that night, it was like a miracle.’

Her boyfriend Gary Ousdahl, 37, was also awed by its appearance on March 14. 

‘I’ve sat at this table a million times but never seen Jesus on it before,’ he said. 

Its deep spiritual meaning hasn’t stopped them putting the table on eBay with a $5,000 (£3,350) price tag - however it is yet to receive any bids.

In October, John Cranfield, 24, who lives in Manchester, inserted a slice of wholemeal bread into the toaster and was baffled when it popped out with the face of Jesus Christ.

Mr Cranfield, a Catholic, said he was sure it is a message from God, adding: ‘As a strong Christian I believe that this was no mistake, I believe that God himself had sent it to me to prove that he exists and that I should not give up my faith.’

Over the years, images of Christ have also appeared on crisps, pancakes, banana peel, pizza and ice cream.
