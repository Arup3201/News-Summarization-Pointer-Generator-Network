Held: Former News of the World legal manager Tom Crone who was arrested at his London home this morning

The News of the World's former legal adviser Tom Crone has been arrested over alleged phone hacking.

The 60-year-old was held at his home in south west London this morning on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and is being questioned at a south London police station.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The 60-year-old man was arrested at his
home address at approximately 6.45am,' but refused to comment on whether or not the suspect was a journalist.

Mr Crone is the 25th person to be arrested under Operation Weeting, the Met Police’s investigation into allegations of phone hacking.

The long-standing legal advisor, who left News International last July, had maintained that phone hacking at the NOTW was believed to have gone no further than a single 'rogue reporter' during a 2009 meeting with the culture, media and sport select committee. 

But when Rupert Murdoch appeared before the Leveson Inquiry into press standards earlier this year, he appeared to suggest Mr Crone was behind a cover-up at the company.

Mr Murdoch claimed a 'clever lawyer and drinking pal of the journalists' had stopped employees from talking about the alleged hacking and had kept the truth from senior executives.

Mr Crone later hit back at the comments, issuing a statement that said: 'Since Rupert Murdoch’s evidence today about a lawyer who had been on the News of the World 
for many years can only refer to me, I am issuing the following 
statement.

'His assertion that I “took charge of a cover-up” in relation to 
phone-hacking is a shameful lie. The same applies to his assertions that
I misinformed senior executives about what was going on and that I 
forbade people from reporting to Rebekah Brooks or to James Murdoch.

Cover-up: When Rupert Murdoch appeared before the Leveson Inquiry into press standards earlier this year, he appeared suggest Mr Crone had been involved in a cover-up at the company

'It is perhaps no coincidence that the two people he has identified 
in relation to his cover-up allegations are the same two people who 
pointed out that his son’s evidence to the Parliamentary Select 
Committee last year was inaccurate.

'The fact that Mr Murdoch’s attack on Colin Myler and myself may have
been personal as well as being wholly wrong greatly demeans him.'

Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Monday over charges linked to Operation Weeting.

Charges: Former NI chief executive Rebekah Brooks, left, is due to appear in court on Monday over charges linked to Operation Weeting, while David Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson, right, appeared in court earlier this month

She is accused of one general charge of conspiracy to illegally access voicemails, and two others relating to murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and former union boss Andrew Gilchrist.

Seven other people including David Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson appeared at the same court earlier this month to face phone hacking charges.

The group included six members of staff from the now-defunct tabloid the News of the World (NOTW), who all face the general charge alongside Brooks, as well as specific counts linked to individual people.

Former NOTW editor Coulson is accused, along with ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, former news editor Greg Miskiw, former head of news Ian Edmondson, ex-chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup.

Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire has also been charged.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
