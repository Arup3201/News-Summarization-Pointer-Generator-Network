A service station attendant has been left shaken after an axe-wielding armed robber held up the same premises twice in five days.

When the bandit, dressed in a hoodie and black cap, returned with the weapon for a second time on Wednesday, the worker had only just returned behind the counter after the first robbery.

Manager Anne Roa said his employee had been 'quite surprised because the guy came back' to the United Service petrol station on Les Darcy Drive, South Maitland, northwest of Newcastle so soon.

A man armed with an axed robbed the same service station, located in South Maitland, twice

The employee at the service station was surprised to see the man return for a second robbery

The first hold up happened on Friday, June 27 about 3.30am and the second on Wednesday, July 2 about 2.15am.

CCTV footage of the first raid showed the man approach the attendant before pulling the axe from beneath his jumper and lunging at the attendant.

He took the drawer of the till before walking out of the store.

For the second robbery, the man wore shorts, jumper and a beanie as he waited to be let into the shop.

Once inside, he again pulls out his axe and starts waving it at the attendant.

He again takes the whole drawer and walks off, before running back at the attendant, who had pressed a button to lock the doors. He then allowed the man to flee.

Police have released some images of the offender to help with investigations

The first hold up happened on Friday, June 27 about 3.30am, with the second hold, pictured, taking place on Wednesday July 2 about 2.15am

'About a year ago, a man tried to hold up the store, but was unable to. He came with a mask so when the staff realised he was a robbery, he didn't get through because they didn't let him into the store,' Ms Rao said.

'This time the man came in as a normal customer. He (the current attendant) didn't see a weapon and the man didn't pull out the axe until he was in the store.

'The second time he didn't recognise him because he was wearing different clothing. Again he came in as a normal customer and pulled out the axe.'

The man is of Caucasian appearance, aged in his early 20s, of thin build and wearing dark clothing and a beanie.

In the second robbery, the man wears the beanie and the CCTV footage shows him waiting to be let into the the petrol station shop and walking casually to the counter

The offender entered United Service petrol station on Les Darcy Drive in the suburb north west of Newcastle

Central Hunter acting crime manager Mitch Dubojski said while robberies are sometimes committed in the same area in a short period of time, this one was different.

'To have them come back in such a short period of time is very rare - it is very unusual for them to return to the same location and also disturbing,' he said.

He said although not injured, the attendant was shaken.

'He was just doing his job and trying ti do the right thing and serve people when he was attacked in his workplace,' he said.

Police have urged the public to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 with any information.

Despite being left shaken, the service station worker was not injured and has already returned to work
