Rishi Gosain, a former tax accountant who had a secret life as a pimp, controlling dozens of prostitutes

A respected accountant who had a second career as a pimp and controlled up to 50 prostitutes was jailed today.

Tax accountant Rishi Gosain, 41, also secretly filmed himself having sex with women during 'interviews' for work at his brothels, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

The defendant, formerly of Rotherwood Avenue, Stretford, Manchester, was jailed for two and a half years after pleading guilty to controlling prostitution for gain.

He also admitted eight counts of voyeurism and was jailed for four months for each offence, to be served concurrently.

Two of the girls were later found to have been 16 and 17 years old but the prosecution did not claim that the defendant knew they were under 18, the court was told.

Two charges of controlling a child prostitute were ordered to lie on file.

David Watson, for the prosecution, described the defendant as a 'controlling' influence who insisted the women have sex with him to 'test her skills' before they were employed.

He said: 'It was a feature of the defendant’s way of carrying out business that he would often insist during these interviews that the women would perform sexual acts with him.

'However, many of the sexual acts were videoed on his laptop. This recording took place without the permission and knowledge of the women concerned.'

Mr Watson said Gosain operated a number of escort agencies with names including Elvish Escorts, 24/7 Companions, Glamorous Escorts and Liverpool Incall Escorts.

But in reality they were fronts for the brothels, including one in Manchester’s City Heights apartment building and another at City Gate West, Liverpool.

Once the women were hired, he gave them false names such as Candy and Lolita, Mr Watson said.Mr Watson said: 'The defendant would take a fee, commonly 30 per cent to 35 per cent, which the girls would place in an envelope for him.

'There is evidence that between January 2010 and May 2012 a total of £94,730.67 in cash payments were made into bank accounts controlled by the defendant.'

In his police interviews, Gosain said he had as many as 40 or 50 women working for him.He claimed he only had sex with five or 10 of them.

Alastair Edie, defending, said in mitigation that Gosain had been a 'respected and highly qualified' tax and management accountant until his arrest in March last year.The defendant, whose wife gave birth to their first child, a son, in December, had since lost his job.

Passing sentence, Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said the prostitution business was a 'large scale and substantial concern'.

'Even on your own estimate, you had 40 or 50 escorts engaged in this business,' he told the defendant.

'It is clear from all of this that you had very close involvement and control in the prostitution.

'You also, on a number of occasions, covertly recorded yourself in the course of sexual activities for your own sexual gratification.

'You had, parallel of course to this unlawful enterprise, a professional career which has been terminated given the publicity associated with this prostitution.'

David Watson, for the prosecution, told Liverpool Crown Court the defendant was a 'controlling' influence who insisted the women have sex with him to 'test her skills' before they were employed

In addition to the jail sentence, Gosain was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register and given a Sexual Offences Prevention Order which prevents him from creating or maintaining websites which relate to escort or modelling agencies.

The prosecution said it will pursue Gosain under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize his illegal income.

After the hearing, Detective Inspector Chris Sephton of Merseyside Police said: 'Today is the culmination of a 12-month long investigation and the sentencing and on-going restrictions Mr Gosain has received reflects the serious nature of his offences.

'We would not have been able to bring this man to justice, had it not been for the brave witnesses who came forward and reported these offences.

'I hope today’s sentencing would also encourage other victims of such offences to come forward.

'Our message is that no matter what your situation is, we have systems in place, working with partner agencies, to offer support and guidance.'
