Fifty shades of wine: The South African dessert wine Vin de Constance is seeing sales boom

It's a wine mentioned in Dickens and Jane Austen — but when it appeared in the Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy sales really took off.

The South African dessert wine Vin de Constance is listed on the menu at a masked ball which lovers Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele attend.

Fifty Shades fans are now flocking to the Klein Constantia wine estate, ten miles from Cape Town.

Managing director Hans Astrom says: ‘We’re asked every day by people coming into our tasting rooms about the wine appearing in the book.

'It’s always been a favourite of emperors and kings.

'Thanks to author E.L. James many more people are discovering one of the great wines of the world.’

The bottle of wine, which is priced at around £30, was first made on the Constantia Estate in the late 1660s and was celebrated in Austen, Dickens and Baudelaire's novels.

The dessert wine is produced in the oldest winemaking area in the Western Cape from hand harvested, shrivelled grapes.

Sell-out success: The sell out novel is drawing wine fans to South Africa to get their hands on the tipple

Fresh and floral in taste with a hint of spice, the wine can age for up to twenty years and is recommended to be enjoyed with tarte tatin or creme brûlée.
