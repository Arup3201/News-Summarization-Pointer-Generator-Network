An ecologist who fell to his death at a beauty spot where he regularly went birdwatching was suffering depression triggered by a battle to land his 'dream job', an inquest heard.

Antony Wainwright, 42, from Westhoughton, Bolton, was said to have struggled to get the career he wanted after securing a 2.1 honours degree in ecology and environmental science at university.

The father of two died after he fell over the edge of Cox Green Quarry in Egerton, near Bolton, in August. 

At an inquest into his death in Bolton on Friday, coroner Alan Walsh recorded an open verdict as he described Mr Wainwright as 'a very intelligent man with an excellent degree'.

Antony Wainwright, 42, from Westhoughton, Bolton, was found at the bottom of Cox Green Quarry in Egerton, in August. The inquest into his death heard how he had suffered from depression since leaving university

The ecological consultant had been heavily involved with sports facilities, especially golf courses, and provided ecological appraisals, surveys and a range of wildlife-related reports including studies of migratory birds.

He was also a keen ornithologist and was the appointed recorder of birds for Greater Manchester, often visiting the quarry where he died to record bird sightings.

Last January, he eventually got the job he wanted as an ecologist at the Sports Turf Research Institute in Bingley, West Yorkshire, but within months his marriage broke down.

Shortly afterwards, he took an overdose of painkillers while on holiday in Malaga with his family.

However, his family were said to be unaware of the overdose and it only came to light after he told doctors upon his return.

After the breakdown of his marriage in June, he moved in with friends.

His estranged wife Lyndsey told the inquest: 'We had talked about a reconciliation.

'We said we would consider it but just not now.'

She said she knew he had suffered from depression and said it had centred on the fact he struggled to get into the career he really wanted.

She told the hearing: 'I knew he suffered from depression. I think it had always been there but started really after university when he struggled to into the career field he wanted.

'The job he had now is his dream job. He had got his dream job, he was doing want he wanted.

'He loved work. He would often go out by himself and watch birds as a recorder but also because it was his passion.

'He would travel abroad a lot with his job and would go to Ireland a lot. He was set to travel to Ireland the Sunday after he was found.'

The inquest also heard how Mr Wainwright was held in police cells in March 2011 after threatening to jump off a quarry following a drunken works party.

He was arrested for being drunk and disorderly after police went to the quarry following reports he had run away from his friends after a 'significant amount to drink' and made a comment that would jump off. He was kept in a cell for the night but freed without charge.

Ms Wainwright added: 'It was some work do. He was just drinking. I wouldn't say he intended to take any action - he had just been drinking far too much.'

She said she last saw him on August 1 when he popped around to their family home to collect his driving licence to take with him for a work trip to Ireland.

She said: 'I was at home with a work colleague and Antony returned home to collect his driving licence to go to Ireland.

'He was fine. He spoke to me and my friend, found his licence and left. He didn't contact me again.'

Phillip Coyle, a friend of Mr Wainwright, told the inquest that he was aware of the police incident in 2011 and said the pair had discussed the breakdown of Mr Wainwright's marriage.

He said: 'He told me once he got drunk with some do at work and he was at a pub near Cox Green Quarry and told police he was going to do something stupid.

'He told me he spent the night in a police cell to sober up. I think it was more of a joke to do with drinking too much basically.

'We had talked about his reconciliation. He said they were talking and had been going through peaks and troughs but good times were more than bad times. He seemed to be getting better.'

Mr Wainwright had been living with Mr Coyle and his girlfriend Joanna Bednarz at the time of his death.

Ms Bednarz told the inquest that he had seemed 'very happy' when she last saw him.

She said: 'I knew him before the marriage broke down and he was much happier then but as is normal with the breakdown of marriage he was sad.

'He never mentioned any suicidal thoughts. I spoke to him on the Friday and he seemed to be very happy.

'Then we had a conversation about what he had planned for the weekend.

'At 7.30am on Saturday morning I heard him moving down stairs. I didn't see him. I thought he had gone to get himself a drink. At 8.15am we went downstairs and he had gone.'

Mr Wainwright was found at the bottom of the quarry on Sunday August 3 after his friend put out a missing person enquiry. Police were alerted after a passerby reported seeing his car parked at the beauty spot for around 24 hours. He died from severe neck injuries.

Coroner Mr Walsh returned an open conclusion and said: 'I have considered whether he took his own life by jumping from the top of the quarry to the ground beneath.

'I am sure he did the act that caused his death as there was no third party involvement but I am not sure he meant to take his own life.. He left no notes and nor did he indicate his intent.

'He was a very intelligent man with an excellent degree. He was someone who wanted to work as an ecologist and wanted to work in the open and he had achieved this.'
