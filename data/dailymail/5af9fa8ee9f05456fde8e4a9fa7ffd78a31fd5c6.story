As police carted away evidence in brown paper bags, detectives refused to confirm reports that the 'suspicious package' found on a Sydney ferry was a bottle filled with liquid and nails.

Detective Inspector Dave Richard Sydney City LAC said police would not comment on the nature of the item as it was 'early in the investigation'. 

However he did reveal that it was a member of the ferry staff and not a member of the other public who made the discovery.

'Our investigators are combing Circular Quay for CCTV at the moment and we will see exactly what transpired', Det Insp Richard said.

NSW police deemed the object as 'not suspicious' around 3pm AEDT.  

The ABC reported earlier this afternoon that the item was a bottle with liquid and nails inside with wires hanging from the bottle.
