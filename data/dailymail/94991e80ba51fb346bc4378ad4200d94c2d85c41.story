Two muggers have been jailed thanks to a 'tracking' app used by police to trace an iPhone they snatched at knife-point.

Ziggy Cawley, 19, and his 18-year old cousin Patrick grabbed the smartphone at knifepoint not realising their victim had earlier installed the free 'Find My iPhone' app as a security measure.

Both were subsequently traced to a house 15 miles away after police were given log-in details of the missing mobile and activated the app using another device.

Ziggy Cawley, 19, and his cousin Patrick, 19, were each sentenced to 40 months in prison for the mugging

During the search officers were able to send a message to the stolen phone which then pinpointed its exact location.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Ziggy of Bury, and Patrick, of Heywood, were each locked away for 40 months after admitting robbery.

The phone was stolen when the Cawleys robbed three young people as they sat in a Seat car outside a McDonald's restaurant in Oldham last September 29.

The Cawleys threatened the driver with a Stanley knife and forced the victims out of the car, then drove away with their phones.

Officers tracked the GPS signal from the phone and found the Cawleys in the bedroom of a house in Bury.

Both men were in bed when officers sent a message to the stolen iPhone 4 - which made a sound from a drawer in the room.

Two other mobile phones stolen in the raid were also recovered by police.

Detective Inspector Dave Massey, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'I cannot stress enough how important it is to get one of these apps in case your phone is stolen.

'It was crucial in finding these offenders and if the victim hadn't had the app, it would have been extremely difficult to trace these two men.'

The Find My iPhone app is free to download from the App Store with an Apple ID.

Users of the app can also install it on other iOS devices, such as an iPad, an iPod touch, or a Mac computer.

The app can locate a missing device on a map, play a sound, display a message, remotely lock the device and erase all user data.

The software can give driving directions to help the user travel to the location of their phone.

Google has a similar app for Android phones, entitled 'Find My Phone' and Blackberry has created 'Blackberry Protect' for the same purpose.
