A young woman who vanished as a teenager may have been found hundreds of miles from home.

Ashley Summers of Cleveland, Ohio is believed to have been spotted in video footage taken from a bank ATM in Warwick, Rhode Island this January, eight years after the 14-year-old first was reported as missing.

This as the FBI has revealed she may be wanted in connection with check theft and identity fraud in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

NBC News reports that Summers' step-grandmother Linda stumbled across the photo when the FBI posted it online looking for information about the woman, at which point she immediately sent photos of Summers to the Warwick Police Department as they searched for leads in locating the woman. 

When that did not work, the FBI stepped in to launch a wider search, even posting billboards along the East Coast. 

Despite the young woman's possible criminal activity, this would be amazing news for the family as some believed Summers may have been a victim of Ariel Castro, the Cleveland kidnapper who held three woman against their will in his House of Horrors for years.

Michelle Knight, one of the victims, said upon her release that she remembered another girl being at the house at some point around the time Summers first disappeared on July 6, 2007.

Knight said the victim disappeared shortly after.

Authorities immediately believed the girl could have been Summers as she lived in the same neighborhood as Castro.

Summers' mother, Jennifer, has always been firm in her belief that her daughter was taken against her will and would never have run off from home on her own.

Summers was living with an uncle at the time of his disappearance, arguing with the man shortly before she vanished.

She may have called her mother a year later, who claims she received a call from a woman who said; 'It's me mom. Dont worry.'

And as the FBI calls on the public to help locate this woman, Summers' mother is hoping she will finally be able to see her daughter again after all these years and 'erase the pain' she has felt since that day in 2007. 

'There's nothing that tells us that it is her, but there's nothing telling us that it's not her either,' said FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).
