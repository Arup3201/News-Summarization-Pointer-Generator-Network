An Albuquerque, New Mexico dad who found a naked prowler peering into his young daughter's room will face charges after seriously beating the peeping tom.

Police say Emilio Chavez III found 29-year-old Dylan Maho naked and making noises near a little girl's window when he chose to exact vigilante justice and beat Maho so badly he was taken to the hospital.

While both men could be convicted of felonies, Chavez could potentially get a longer sentence for what he did to the intruder.

Furious: Emilio Chavez III was so angry when he found a naked man pepping into his daughter's window that he can't remember severely beating he man

Peeping tom: Pictured is the window where Chavez claims he found Dylan Maho peeping at his daughter while naked and 'making sounds'

'There's a naked man outside his daughter's window,' Chavez's neighbor Bill Morang told KOAT. 'I think he was well within his rights chasing him down and beating him.'

But
 the district attorney disagrees. Though police initially let the irate 
father go free after questioning, he is now charged with aggrevated 
battery, a felony.

Maho,
 who remained in the hospital Monday but was upgraded to stable 
condition, will be formally charged with felony voyeurism upon his 
release.

According to Justia.com, Chavez could be convicted of a third degree felony. That means he could face up to three years in jail.

Bloody: Solvent outside the Chavez home covers blood left by the incident that put 29-year-old Maho in the hospital, where he remained Monday

Support: Neighbor Bill Morang supports Chavez but the district attorney says he committed a crime in the eyes of the law

The charges against Maho, which amount to a fourth degree felony, a lesser charge than Chavez's, can mean between one and two years in jail.

Chavez told KRQE that he was so angry that night of the alleged intrusion that he doesn't even remember assaulting the man.

Meanwhile, this isn't the first run-in the neighborhood has had with the peeping tom.

'They call him the nudist around here' Morang told KOB.com. 'Apparently he's been looking in other peoples' windows.'

Morang, himself a father, believes the nude man is the same one he says holds sexual parties at a nearby home that he calls 'swinger' parties.

Morang also claims he's found condom rappers in the street and maintained Chavez did exactly what he should have done.

'I would've done a little worse than what happened to him and I think any man or dad would do the same,' Morang said. 'I feel bad for the other guy and I hope nothing bad happens to him for protecting his family. I think he did what's right.'
