David Cameron was hailed as a living god yesterday as  he was mobbed by mothers  of the disappeared in Sri  Lanka’s killing fields.

Families of hundreds of Tamil men and boys seized by the regime descended on the Prime Minister as he became the first world leader to visit the war-ravaged north of the country since Sri Lanka won independence in 1948.

Mr Cameron visited a refugee camp and a newspaper whose journalists have been murdered before reading the riot act to President Mahinda Rajapaksa at a heated meeting in the capital Colombo.

As many as 40,000 civilians are estimated to 
have died in the final months of the regime's 26-year fight with Tamil 
Tiger separatists in 2009, according to the UN

On seeing Mr Cameron in Jaffna, a group of 200 women brandishing posters of their loved ones who have disappeared broke through a security cordon.

Three women reached the car and tried to hand over information about the missing before being knocked to the ground by police.

Mr Cameron then travelled to Kannaki refugee camp to meet those whose loved ones are believed to have been killed by the regime at the end of Sri Lanka’s civil war.

Families have lived there for 23 years.

Human rights groups say that up to 40,000 civilians were slaughtered in the final offensive against the Tamil Tigers in 2009.

Camp spokesman Sutharshan Uthayaswriyan, said they had high hopes that Mr Cameron’s visit will improve the plight of the Tamils.

‘We believe in David Cameron,’ he said, adding: ‘He is a god coming down to this area.

‘We believe he can make a difference. He is a god and he is sent by God to us.’

Last night Mr Cameron confronted Mr Rajapaksa and his brother, defence minister Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, about claims of war crimes, an exchange the PM described as ‘a very lively meeting’.

Battle: Cameron went to the northern areas that saw the worst of the war between soldiers and ethnic Tamils rebels fighting for a homeland

Powerful: The Prime Minister said he had been confronted by 'incredibly powerful' images during his visit to the north

Voices were raised as Mr Cameron told the president his government should seek a reconciliation deal with the Tamil minority such as that thrashed out in Northern Ireland.

Mr Rajapaksa hit back, accusing Mr Cameron of trying to drum up votes with the 150,000 Tamils living in London.

One Cameron aide described it as the ‘liveliest bilateral I have ever seen’ – diplomatic code for a blazing row. Mr Cameron ‘pressed his points very directly and robustly’, a source said.

President Rajapaksa ended the meeting by asking Mr Cameron for ‘more time’ to make changes, but offered no specific pledges.

Meetings: Prime Minister David Cameron meets with the Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the British High Commission in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo

The meeting became most heated when the Prime Minister raised the case of Tamil newspaper Uthayan, which has had six of its reporters killed in recent years.

In Jaffna, Mr Cameron visited the newspaper’s offices and saw bullet holes in the walls and photographs of the corpses of the murdered journalists.

Tharumangan Tinesh, a 36-year-old reporter, said: ‘Our families are a bit scared to send us to work, but we are working for the truth.’

Mr Cameron said: ‘I think coming here, listening to these people, hearing these arguments, helps to draw attention to their plight. I think the spotlight has been shone on Sri Lanka and people can see the good and the bad.’

Mr Cameron will now lobby world leaders to bring pressure on Mr Rajapaksa to hold a new inquiry into alleged war crimes.
