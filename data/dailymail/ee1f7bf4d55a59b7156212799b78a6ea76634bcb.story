Hair style fads come and go, but braids of all shapes and sizes have held on tightly in the follicular popularity stakes for many a season now.

Which is perhaps why Instabraid - an Instagram account started by two then-15-year-old best friends in 2012 - now boasts a cult following of over one million braid-worshipers.

Shir Ben-Zikry and Sophie Rose, now both 18, from Boca Raton, Florida, posted the first of what would be many self-styled photos of pretty and interesting braids during a school trip two years ago, and have now turned the account into a money-making entrepreneurial success.

Run by teens: The account was founded in 2012 by then 15-year-old high school students and best friends  Shir Ben-Zikry (left) and Sophie Rose (right)

Of their very first post, Sophie tells Today.com: 'One girl in our school had one - she was the coolest girl in school - so Shir and I were like, "Why don’t we try to make an account, and see what happens? We’ll post this braid photo and see how it goes."'

Now, the girls post three to four braids each day, spend eight to ten hours per week on the account's upkeep, and have earned more than $16,000 from sponsored posts.

Some of the braids are selectively chosen from daily email submissions, others are regrams of photos tagged #Instabraid. The girls also post braid-sporting celebrities from time-to-time; Jennifer Aniston recently featured with her fishtail selfie, as well as Emmy Rossum and Paris Hilton - both of whom follow Instabraid themselves.

'Getting a braid is the ultimate way to instantly feel like a goddess'

Many of the unique braids are accompanied with step-by-step tutorials on their Instabraid offshoot website. This week, the girls also launched their own range of hair elastics in collaboration with online store Emi Jay; another entrepreneurial powerhouse run by teenagers.

So what is it about these interwoven hair styles that has brought Sophie and Shir such success, and holds such an enduring appeal for women?

Nikki Lee, co-owner of Nine Zero One Salon in West Hollywood, which opened its own Braid Bar three years ago says: 'Getting a braid is the ultimate way to instantly feel like a goddess.

'There are so many different styles you can do with braids. Just when you thought you've seen every braid, someone comes up with something new.'

Kayley Pak, a stylist at John Barrett's Braids Bar in New York, notes: 'I think braiding has remained such a popular trend because it is a quick and easy effortless style, which looks very natural and feminine. Braids make women feel youthful and fun.'
