Criticism: Judith Hackitt said the HSE would target officials who wrongly used health and safety to stop everyday activities

Misguided 'jobsworths' are robbing children of educational experiences and fun in school playgrounds by applying over-zealous safety laws for fear of being sued, experts have warned.

The chairman of the Health and Safety Executive accused employers of cynically using health and safety rules as a 'convenient excuse' for avoiding activities that might cost money or expose them to being sued for personal injury.

Judith Hackitt said school playgrounds have been turned into 'joyless no-go zones' which risk harming children's education due to bureaucrats' fear of being sued.

Warning that 'the gloves are off', Ms Hackitt warned that her organisation is ready to take on the officials who use health and safety rules as a scapegoat when they make 'daft decisions' to ban innocuous activities.

Health and safety rules were wrongly blamed for decisions to make children wear goggles when playing conkers, to ban running at a pancake race and to stop tennis fans watching the Wimbledon action on big screens from Murray Mount, she said.

Ms Hackitt told the Daily Telegraph that health and safety had become 'shorthand for someone, somewhere, stopping someone from doing something they want to'.

She sent out a message to anyone using it as an excuse: 'Don't use health and safety law as a convenient scapegoat or we will challenge you.'

Excessive and unnecessary application of restrictions on unfounded health and safety grounds threatens to spoil children's experience of growing up, said Ms Hackitt.

'The creeping culture of risk-aversion and fear of litigation... puts at risk our children's education and preparation for adult life,' she said.

'Children today are denied - often on spurious health and safety grounds - many of the formative experiences that shaped my generation.

'Playgrounds have become joyless, for fear of a few cuts and bruises.

Science in the classroom is becoming sterile and uninspiring.'

Ms Hackitt is no stranger to hazardous school activities, having previously set her hands alight in a Year 11 science class to spark teenagers' interest in the subject.

Her comments today were aimed at stopping the 'creeping culture of risk aversion and fear of litigation'.

In many cases, the people behind unreasonable rulings were 'well-meaning but misguided jobsworths' who have the public interest at heart but go too far, she said.

But she added: 'A trend of far more concern to me is the use of health and safety as a convenient excuse by employers and other organisations cynically looking for a way to disguise their real motives.'

'The creeping culture of risk-aversion and fear of litigation... puts at risk our children's education and preparation for adult life,' she said.

Ms Hackitt said that to a large degree, organisations imposed health and safety restrictions less from a concern for people's safety, but from fear of no-win no-fee lawsuits for personal injury.

Ms Hackitt's comments came as Education Secretary Michael Gove joined the HSE in announcing they were tearing up much of the red tape required for children to go on school trips.

Schools and local authorities have been told by the HSE to ditch 'unnecessary paperwork', in a move which the organisation hopes will dispel 'myths about legal action'.

The Department for Education, which has also updated its advice, says complex guidance that teachers previously needed to grapple with has been slashed from 150 pages to just eight.

Mr Gove said: 'Children should be able to go on exciting school trips that broaden their horizons.

'That is why we are cutting unnecessary red tape in schools and putting teachers back in charge.

'This new, slimmer advice means a more common sense approach to health and safety. It will make it easier for schools to make lessons more inspiring and fun.'
