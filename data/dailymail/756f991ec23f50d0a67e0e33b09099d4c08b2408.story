A teenager who was given just weeks to live at the age of four is celebrating after gaining an impressive 12 GCSEs.

Kirsty Howard, 16, from Manchester, was born with her heart back-to-front - a condition so rare it did not even have a name. Her parents were told she had only six weeks to live.

But the youngster, who has led a campaign
to raise £5 million for Francis House Children’s Hospice in Manchester,
has battled against the odds and is today celebrating exam success.

Exam joy: Kirsty Howard, who was given just weeks to live at the age of four is celebrating after gaining an impressive 12 GCSEs

Kirsty, a pupil at Newall Green High School in Wythenshawe, said: 'It was scary but it went OK.'

Kirsty said she had been out for a celebration lunch after having to spend most of the morning in hospital.

The teenager, who still suffers from the rare heart defect which could end her life at any moment, is determined to live life to the full and now intends to go to sixth form college and eventually go on to study Child Care.

The teenager has won a host of famous admirers during her lifetime.

Former England football star David 
Beckham was befriended by the youngster when she led out the England 
team at Old Trafford in 2001, for a World Cup qualifier against Greece 
in which her hero scored the winning goal.

A
year later, she met Beckham again as she handed over the Golden Jubilee
baton to the Queen at the opening ceremony for the Manchester 
Commonwealth Games.

She has also spent time with David and Samantha Cameron, as well as former prime minister and his wife Tony and Cherie Blair.

In 2004 she won the Helen Rollason Award for courage at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards.

Kirsty continues to do charity work through The Kirsty Club which aims to keep improving the Francis House Children’s Hospice.

Schoolgirl Kirsty Howard has defied all the odds to battle through against her heart condition

The extraordinary 16-year-old has won a host of famous admirers during her lifetime.

Former England football star David Beckham was befriended by the youngster when she led out the England team at Old Trafford in 2001, for a World Cup qualifier against Greece in which her hero scored the winning goal.

A year later, she met Beckham again as she handed over the Golden Jubilee baton to the Queen at the opening ceremony for the Manchester Commonwealth games.

'Weeks to live': Even now Kirsty, pictured here in 2004, said she knows she could die any second - but she has remarkably survived and continues to live a very full life

She was born with a back-to-front heart

Her heart problem has subsequently caused the misplacement of her internal organs

The condition is a form of situs ambiguus and can't be cured with an operation

As a result Kirsty needs a constant oxygen supply to keep her alive

She was is the only person in the UK, and only the second in the world, diagnosed with the condition in February 1999

She was initially only given only six weeks to live, but has defied the odds to reach her teens

Mingling with the stars hasn't gone to Kirsty's head, however, and just like many teenagers her age she loves going to the cinema with friends - with posters of her movie idol Robert Pattinson filling-up the walls of her bedroom.

In 2004 she won the Helen Rollason Award for courage at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards.

As a youngster, she was also chosen as the face of the £5million Kirsty Club appeal for the Francis House Children's Hospice in Didsbury, Manchester.

She continues to appeal through The Kirsty Club which aims to make the hospice even bigger and better.

The money raised by The Kirsty Club will be used to expand Francis House to help meet the needs of more than 900 families of children with a short life expectancy.

Having reached her teenage years she also has big hopes for the future.

She admits she doesn't have a boyfriend yet, but would love to have a big wedding with Beckham as the guest of honour.

She said in The People: 'I lead a normal life. I go to school. I have lots of friends. I spend every night texting, going on the computer and watching TV.

'I love Corrie and Eastenders and especially Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor. I've also started salsa dance lessons with my sister. I can get out of my wheelchair to do it. Its so much fun.Kirsty, who has had 11 major operations, added: 'It's not been easy, but this is who I am and its helped me do a lot of good for others.

'My secret is to be positive, not to let anything get me down.'
