It was a night to sip fine wine and puff on fat cigars, savouring the rewards of a job well done.

And as the crème-de-la-crème of Britain’s bailiffs loosened their belts and bow ties after a lavish dinner at a four-star hotel in Manchester, it was time for the evening's big winners to step into the spotlight.

As this was the Debt Collection Awards 2013, there should have been plenty of potential for unusual gongs.

Lavish: The Debt Collection Awards, held at the four-star Midland Hotel in Manchester - where rooms cost up to £379 a night - was organised by Credit Today magazine and is now in its seventh year

Entrance: The event last Wednesday was said by organisers to 'recognise the industry¿s outstanding efforts and commitment to best practice' and give more than 500 people in the industry the chance to network

In attendance: Police officers were called to deal with a group of protesters but no arrests were made

Sadly, categories at the event dubbed the Bailiff Oscars did not include Britain’s Best Granny Harasser, Fastest Door Dispenser and Giant 
Telly Seizer Of The Year.

Instead organisers Credit Today took a far more sensible approach and opted for worthy - if rather disappointing - categories with not even a hint of the clichéd skulduggery of old.

Firms 
trooped across the stage last Wednesday to collect awards for Best 
Customer Initiative, Best Use Of Technology and Compliance Team Of The 
Year from comedian Dave Spikey, star of Channel 4 show Phoenix Nights.

Meanwhile,
the real action was outside the £379-a-night Midland Hotel where a 
bunch of anti-capitalist protesters were attempting their own rather 
different form of enforcement.

Outside: People were photographed in front of the prestigious hotel, which was built in the late 19th century

Smoking: The ceremony included a silent auction - where bids are written on a sheet of paper - in aid of financial education charity The Money Charity, which raised more than £6,700

Witnesses
reported police being called to deal with a breakaway group who had 
infiltrated the imposing building, a 312-bedroom hotel which 
dates from the late 19th century.

However, by the time officers arrived after being called at 9.45pm, the group had dispersed and no-one was arrested.

The
Debt Collection Awards was established to recognise the ‘achievements 
of professionals working in debt collection, enforcement, compliance and
debt purchase’, according to publicity material.  

This
year’s ceremony included a silent auction – where bids are written on a
sheet of paper – in aid of financial education charity The Money 
Charity, which raised more than £6,700.

People who have stayed at the hotel or visited in the past include former prime minister Winston Churchill, Princess Diana, Princess Margaret, singer Paul McCartney and actress Sarah Bernhardt.
