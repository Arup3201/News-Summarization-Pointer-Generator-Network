Controversial: Homeowners should be given more freedom to improve their properties, planning minister Nick Boles, pictured, has declared

The Planning Minister has been caught on tape saying anyone can take advantage of George Osborne's Budget package to help home buyers.

Despite Coalition denials that the plan will help the rich buy second homes, Nick Boles told an audience of property developers he 'couldn't care less who owns the bloody things'.

He also claimed the Government was keen to create a house building boom, and pledged further relaxations of planning regulations to make it easier for people to extend or convert their homes without permission.

The Chancellor announced in his Budget that £15.5billion was to be set aside to guarantee mortgages to help 644,000 people buy homes over the next three years.

But Labour said that rather than helping struggling young people get on the housing ladder, it would subsidise well-off people buying second homes or buy-to-lets.

Mr Boles's comments undermine the Government's subsequent denial.

And his suggestion that ministers want to start a building boom will alarm green belt campaigners.

Dan McLean, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: 'On the one hand, there could be good efforts through the Budget to stimulate more housebuilding, but on the other it appears to be at the expense of weakening the planning rules.

'The worrying aspect about this is that Nick Boles seems to be suggesting controls on planning and development should be reduced.

'The Government seems to be moving a long way from the localism the parties pledged when they were elected.'

Mr Osborne said in his Budget on Wednesday that the Government would offer five-year interest-free loans worth up to 20 per cent of the value of new-build homes costing less than £600,000.

It will also offer £12billion of guarantees covering mortgages worth more than £120billion.

Just hours after the announcement, Mr Boles spoke at a reception for property industry figures hosted by Savills estate agents in Mayfair.

He revealed that planning laws will be
liberalised within weeks to allow them to begin a house-building boom 
backed by the Budget.

The minister said the planning 
permission requirement for many developments was to be axed, and he was 
prepared for an acrimonious battle with countryside campaigners.

He said: 'Property owners should be 
able to do some things without asking anyone. That's what property 
rights mean. We want to expand the number of things you can do without 
having to ask for planning permission.'

And he suggested that farm buildings and shops could be turned into homes without change of use being officially granted.
