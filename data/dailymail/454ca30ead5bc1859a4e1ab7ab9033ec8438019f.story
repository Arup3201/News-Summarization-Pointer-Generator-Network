David Cameron is preparing to warn German Chancellor Angela Merkel that he is prepared to take Britain out of the EU without major reform.

The Prime Minister will use talks in London tomorrow to set out his 'red lines' for renegotiation of EU membership, warning that without big changes he will rule nothing out.

They will tour the British Museum before meeting in Downing Street, when Mr Cameron will demand new safeguards for the single market, an end to ever closer union between member states, new 'red card' powers to veto Brussels rules and a major package of welfare curbs.

Mr Cameron has promised that if he is still PM after May's general election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before staging an in-out referendum before the end of 2017.

He has made clear that he thinks his plan will succeed, and he will then recommend staying in the EU.

If he fails he admits he will 'rule nothing out', raising the prospect that he will recommend exit from the 28-nation bloc.

However, Mrs Merkel has insisted that she will not support any moves to alter the fundamental principle of freedom of movement.

She wants Britain to remain in the EU, but senior figures in Berlin have repeatedly said they will not seek to do so at any cost.

The German chancellor will arrive in the UK tomorrow morning and they visit the British Museum to see an exhibition on the history of her country.

The museum's Germany: Memories Of A Nation exhibition traces 600 years of the history, with exhibits including works of art and a Volkswagen Beetle.

Downing Street said that the pair's talks would focus on the German presidency of the G7.

However Mr Cameron will reiterate his warning that if he fails to secure the reforms he could back Britain's exit.

'If I don't get what I want I rule nothing out. Ruling nothing out means just that,' Mr Cameron said at the weekend.

He used a major in November to set out key demands on banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels.

He said: 'EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here. UK taxpayers will not support them if they don't.'

However, today there were reports that the European Commission was preparing to block the move.

The Guardian said the commission is preparing to let Number 10 know that the proposal would be unworkable because it would be impossible to distinguish between EU jobseekers and tourists entering the UK.

Ahead of the visit, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'Germany is facing its own problems at the moment and would not want Britain to start turning away EU jobseekers, potentially redirecting them to seek work there.

'If Chancellor Merkel agreed that UK can close the door on EU jobseekers she would also have to recognise that a great many that were Britain bound would instead seek work in Germany as the continent's biggest economy, and that is a risk she is likely to be unwilling to take.'

Labour's shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden said Chancellor Merkel would not be driven by 'the need to pander to the eurosceptics inside today's Conservative Party'.

He added: 'Even once her visit is over, the gap between what David Cameron's eurosceptic backbenchers are demanding and what European allies such as Germany will accept, remains unbridgeable.

'Europe does need to change, but the tragedy for Britain is that since being elected, David Cameron has spent more time negotiating with his backbenchers than with other EU leaders.'
