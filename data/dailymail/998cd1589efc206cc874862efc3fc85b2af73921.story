A man who dressed up as a clown and entertained at children's parties was arrested after child porn was found on his home computer, police said.

Thomas Harold Morgan, or 'Sondance the Clown', was taken from his home by officers and computer hard drives seized, spokesman Steven Dooly said.

He was not in clown costume when he was arrested in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

The entertainer was tracked down by a police forensic team after they discovered someone downloading the explicit images of children over a file-sharing network.

After following his Internet Service Provider, police found themselves at Morgan's home. Analysis of the material is expected to take several weeks.

Police arrested Morgan on a count of 
distributing, possessing or viewing of matter depicting sexually 
explicit conduct involving a child.

No charges had been formally filed by the prosecutor, Officer Dooly told MailOnline. Morgan was being held at Sebastian County Jail without bond.

Officer Dooly added that police had come into contact with Morgan once before in October 2010. He had turned up at the Arkansas Oklahoma State Fair in his clown costume without being properly registered as a performer.

Officers who noticed him, and had not seen him over the other nights at the event, asked him to leave the carnival.

Morgan's website said he had spent more than 20 years perfecting his craft and studied childhood development so he knew 'how to interact with kids'.

Morgan wrote that he had performed in circuses and bills himself as being available to perform at childrenâ€™s events.

His special clowning talents include balloon sculptures and pocket magic. Morgan has performed at Wal-Mart and Target in Fort Smith and family-friendly venues including Pizza Hut, Red Lobster and Krispy Kreme along the west coast.
