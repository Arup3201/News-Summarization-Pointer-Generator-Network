A Chinese man who was impaled on a steel rod after a fall on a building site has been told he will make a full recovery

Li Dehua, 47, was working on a construction site in Xi’an, west China’s Shaanxi province, when he fell from a window 20 feet up, and onto a protruding steel rod - headfirst.

The rod pierced his head, but somehow missed his brain.

Lucky escape: Li Dehua, 47, from Xi¿an in west China,  fell 20 feet from a window on a construction site and was impaled through his head - but the steel rod missed his brain

The steel rod went in to his face through his left lower jaw, and exited on the left side of his head.

Although
 doctors initially told his family it was unlikely he would survive, 
they discovered during surgery that his brain had miraculously been 
spared.

After 18 days of treatment, Mr Li is now expected to make a full recovery.

He
 said from his hospital bed: ‘It was one of those freak things whereby 
the rod must have missed the key bits of my brain.

'It did a lot of 
damage to my face which still feels stiff, but essentially it missed the
 important bits of the 'computer' above.

Up and running: Although Mr Li's family were told he was unlikely to survive, he is now expected to make a full recovery

Miracle: Doctors operated to save Mr Li's life and discovered that his brain had not sustain any major injuries

‘The pain was not that intense at first. It was almost like I shut down.

‘It was when they moved me that the pain first kicked in. It was terrible.

‘But then I underwent a series of operations so I knew nothing about it.’

He was wearing a safety helmet at the time of the accident but, as he landed on his face, it did nothing to lessen his injuries.

Doctor
 Chung Hsieh, who operated on Mr Li, said: ‘The human brain is an 
amazing organ, it has the potential to absorb enormous damage and still 
survive.’
