More than 1,000 protesters, including fashion icon Vivienne Westwood, have started arriving at a small Sussex village for a five-day anti-fracking camp.

Hundreds of extra police are being deployed at the Balcombe drilling site to cope with the ‘Reclaim the Power’ event.

Organisers have started pitching tents, bringing in food and building make-shift building toilets in preparation.

Among those attending will be veterans of the violent Dale Farm eviction in October 2011, where travellers living illegally on land in Essex, were removed after ten years of contention.

So far, 44 people have been arrested in the protests, but clashes are likely to escalate this weekend, with many new arrivals feared to be intent on confrontation with police.

Surrounded by activists, Dame Vivienne called for a public debate on fracking as she believed it could store up trouble financially and environmentally for generations to come.

'I'm anti-fracking and I'm here to protest. There has been no debate. They are trying to rush this thing through, for what?' she said.

'It's not going to go away. We don't know whether it will do good or bad. I'm sure it's bad and the only people who are going to benefit from it is this energy company who are associated with the Government.

'They all have vested interests. It's kind of a club. They just do it to boost the companies. It will never go into our bills.

'In fact it won't supply energy security whatsoever. It will actually store up trouble for the future, financially as well as environmentally.'

Raising the banner: Activists set up their Reclaim the Power action camp, which is set to last for about five days

Dame Vivienne added: 'I'm really against the idea that the Government is trying to push through legislation so that the councils can't even stop them.

'Who do they think they are when I would say most of the country is really against fracking, particularly at this point in time when we don't know what is at stake.

'You can't push it through.'

Sussex police's deployment of extra officers and the cost may soar to more than £500,000.

Drilling company Cuadrilla is building a 20ft steel wall around its site and will suspend operations. 

It is currently doing exploratory drilling, but many fear fracking could follow. 

Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure underground to split shale rock, releasing oil and gas.

Leaders of campaign group Occupy, which camped at St Paul’s Cathedral, called for ‘a huge show of force’.

Senior
 Tory MP, Tim Yeo, thinks local communities like Balcolmbe should be forced into supporting shale gas drilling - for their own good. 

Mr Yeo said today that small towns have a lot to gain from fracking which could significantly reduce energy costs.

'Local concerns have to be 
respected, but we must compel communities to accept this new method.

There are reserves here we can exploit in the best interest of the country.'

Police have held talks with protest organisers No Dash for Gas, but it is hardline splinter groups they are most worried about. 

A source said: ‘Professional anarchists will travel from towns and cities across Britain hell bent on causing trouble.’

Alison Stevenson, chairman of Balcombe Parish Council, wrote a letter to activists warning trouble makers to stay away.

She said villagers supported peaceful demonstrations, but said they had fears about the intentions of the camp. ‘If the No Dash for Gas group is coming here in the full knowledge it intends to break the law then it should stay away,’ she added.

But other residents welcomed the protests, saying they feared millions would be wiped off property prices in the area if fracking were to go ahead.

Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, has voiced concern about safety on the site and has called on protesters intent on breaking the law: 'Please don't do it.'

Around 1,000 protesters are planning to descend on Balcombe for a five-day camp next week. Anti-fracking protesters are pictured at the site on Monday

He told ITV News: 'I'm quite worried about safety on the site. We have a group who are relocating a camp to the site, who have said publicly that they will be taking direct action against the site.

'It's a small site. There are a small amount of workers on the site. We are doing something that is legally approved and I am worried about the safety implications for our workers, for peaceful protesters.'

Mr Egan's sentiments were echoed by Sussex Police.

Superintendent Lawrence Hobbs said: 'We will continue to facilitate peaceful protest, but newcomers to the site should be aware that if they commit criminal offences, then we will collect the evidence and they will be arrested.'
