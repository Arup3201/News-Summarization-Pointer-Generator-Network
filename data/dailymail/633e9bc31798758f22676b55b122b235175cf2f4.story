Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic have stoked the fire ahead of Chelsea's clash with Liverpool on Saturday by mocking the Merseysiders for their reaction to losing at Anfield back in April.

The match is regarded as the defeat that ultimately ended Liverpool's title challenge and after the game manager Brendan Rodgers quipped that Chelsea had 'parked two buses' in front of the goal.

Midfielder Matic has stuck the boot into Rodgers' side ahead of the game, insisting that Chelsea regularly come up with a solution to beat opponents that defend deep.

'Many teams this season have tried to park the bus in front of the goal against us, but we still win,' the 26-year-old said in The Sun.

The former Benfica midfielder also took a veiled swipe at Liverpool's inability to keep clean sheets - they have only managed two all season.

'It's not easy, if you defend you have to know how you defend.'

Meanwhile, Matic's fellow Serbia international Ivanovic suggested Liverpool failed to cope with the pressure of the occasion back in April.

'It was three games to go, they were fighting for the title and they wanted to win, but they struggled in a must-win match.

'It was 2-0 and in that game we showed we had quality. But nobody's happy when you lose and they weren't happy after that game.'
