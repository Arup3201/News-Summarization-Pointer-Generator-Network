In court: Dane Bowers arrives at Norwich Crown Court today where he admitted common assault

Singer and former Big Brother star Dane Bowers must perform community service after admitting common assault during a drunken night out.

Norwich Crown Court heard how Bowers led a group of men in a violent confrontation against another group, including two black men, outside a nightclub in the city.

During the attack, the 33-year-old former partner of glamour model Katie Price, grabbed a man by the neck and 'shook him around', the court heard.

Witnesses said they heard Bowers shouting racist language but when challenged he told them: 'Don't accuse me of being racist, my father's black'.

Other witnesses said somebody else may have shouted the abuse.

When arrested Bowers told police that he was '8 out of 10 drunk' with 10 being a state of total drunkenness.

He had been due to stand trial today accused of two counts of assault on separate victims and one of harassment - all allegedly racially aggravated.

But today Bowers, who wore a grey shirt, waistcoat and tie in court, admitted one count of common assault and one of threatening behaviour, both without any racial element.

Judge Stephen Holt ordered that he compete 120 hours of unpaid work for the community. He must also pay Â£1,000 in legal costs.

Prosecutor John Farmer said the other charges would not be proceeded with.

Mr Farmer said the incident happened after 5am on June 2 in Prince of Wales Road, Norwich's nightclub district.

'The defendant was with a group of friends and much drink had been consumed,' he added.

'There was a confrontation and Mr Bowers was then the front runner in a group of young men driving up Prince of Wales Road as another man backed off.'

Kevin Molloy, mitigating, said that Bowers was 'many degrees away from somebody who could be deemed racist'. He added that his grandfather is Jamaican.

Bowers is involved in charitable work including with the Sodje Sports Foundation which develops grass roots sport in Nigeria and with tackling racism in football, Mr Molloy added.

'Whatever was said was said by somebody not in his group,' he added.

Mr Molloy pleaded that a curfew, which would mean Bowers must stay home during certain hours, not be imposed so as not to interfere with his musical career.

Bowers, from Coulsdon, Surrey, had two previous convictions for drink driving and was cautioned for common assault on New Year's Eve, 2005.

Judge Holt told him: 'You got thoroughly drunk, putting it politely, and got in all sorts of trouble.

'It seems highly unlikely that you, given your background, would have made racist remarks.

'Putting that to one side, problems on Prince of Wales Road are a constant thorn in the side of this city - young men go out and get drunk and cause a great deal of problems.'

It is understood Bowers had been enjoying a stag night with friends at the time.

The singer, now a DJ, rose to fame with boy band Another Level in the 1990s. He appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2010.
