Roberto Martinez has hailed Samuel Eto'o's impact on Everton's squad and described his signing as a 'gift from the footballing Gods'.

Eto'o's influences on Everton's team has been growing with each week and he was outstanding in last Sunday's 3-1 win at Burnley, scoring twice and coming within the width of a post of collecting the match ball.

Martinez moved late to sign the Cameroonian in the final days of the transfer window, taking the chance to recruit him as a free agent after Liverpool opted to pursue a £16million deal for Mario Balotelli instead.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez has said the signing of Samuel Eto'o is a 'gift from the footballing Gods'

The deal already looks smart business as Eto'o has scored four times but, more than anything, it is the impact he has had on Everton's dressing room that has so impressed Everton's manager.

'Nothing changes from our point of view in terms of how we will use him,' said Martinez. 'Having Samuel Eto'o here is like a gift from the footballing Gods for us. He is the perfect ingredient for our young players, a phenomenal example.

'The way he has been working to get his fitness is pristine. He is a player of the highest, highest calibre. To see his performance on Sunday – and every role he has played so far – has been so exciting and his knowhow has been very important, particularly in European games.

'But the way he took his finishes at Burnley was like the old days. I hope he can enjoy his football here and we are working hard to make that happen. I think he is enjoying it and that is very important.

Samuel Eto'o worked his socks off in Everton’s win at Turf Moor. Far from his more familiar role as a target man, he played as an attacking midfielder in support of Romelu Lukaku. 

Though  playing down the left, he moved across the width of the pitch, as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows (below). And he put in a shift in his own box for corners too. Not too shabby for a 33-year-old.

'He has that stimulation to win things. He comes in every day with the highest standards and he wants more work. I think Everton can give him an important chapter in his career.'

Eto'o could retain his place on Saturday when Everton seek their third consecutive win in the Barclays Premier League against Swansea, the club with whom Martinez started his managerial career.

He expects Romelu Lukaku, who suffered what Martinez called 'a couple of heavy knocks' at Turf Moor last Sunday, to be in contention and Martinez is thrilled with the attacking options Everton have.

'We started the season well in terms of our attacking play,' said Martinez. 'We have been able to score in every game and there have been eight different scores so far. The goals we scored against Chelsea showed we have the potential to hurt anyone.

'We were a bit soft at the back early on and conceded some goals that affected results. Rom is getting stronger game by game and we are very happy with the squad. I just want them to be in the best physical shape for the second half of the season.

'But we are a lot tighter now, we have had back-to-back wins and it has been good to enjoy good performances in Europe. We have now got a massive game against Swansea and we will have to play as we did against Aston Villa to get anything.'
