Paul Mitchell was this week appointed as Tottenham's head of recruitment and analysis, but head coach Mauricio Pochettino has indicated he had nothing to do with his departure from former club Southampton.

A week after high-flying Saints opened their £33million training ground, reports emanated that the 33-year-old would be following the former Argentina international to White Hart Lane.

Pochettino penned a five-year deal as head coach in the summer and on Wednesday it was confirmed that Mitchell had also made the move to north London.

Tottenham are believed to have paid Southampton compensation for the former Wigan and MK Dons player, who links up again with the coaching staff he worked with at St Mary's.

Pochettino, though, suggests it was others at the club and not him that took the decision to hire Mitchell.

'I never spoke about the new appointment,' the Spurs boss said.

'I know Paul from Southampton but only I say all the best and good luck in his job.'

Asked if he had any role in the appointment, Pochettino said: 'No. The club find him and proposed the job.'

Mitchell's arrival at Tottenham will further complicate an already politically charged structure, with director of football Franco Baldini and chairman Daniel Levy both prominent in transfer negotiations.

It also leaves a void at Southampton, yet manager Ronald Koeman is unfazed by the exit of the man that has headed up the club's scouting and recruitment department since January 2012.

'I think it more of a reflection of what he did and what the club is doing over the last few years,' Koeman said.

'Okay, we would like to keep everybody in, but it is football, it is life. There are changes, not only with the players but managers, with technical directors, with chairmen - as well in the position of Paul Mitchell.

'Good luck to him, and we have to look for another one to bring in.'
