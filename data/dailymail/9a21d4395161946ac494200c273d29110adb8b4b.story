Punk legend Chrissie Hynde has supported a campaign to ban horse-drawn carriages from New York City and replace them with $450,000 'vintage' eCarriages.

The Pretenders singer arrived in one of the electrically-powered carriages outside the Beacon Theatre on Broadway before a recent show.

The singer is backing a plan by animal rights charity NYCLASS, who want to remove all the horses from the city streets.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he wants horse drawn carriages - clip-clopping rides through Central Park are a famous tourist attraction - gone from city streets because they are cruel to the animals.

While he initially promised to get rid of the carriages within a week of taking office at the start of the year, he now expects a ruling on their future by the end of the year.

According to CBS New York, Hynde said: 'If you want an historic trip through the city of New York, and a romantic trip through Central Park, we suggest you use of these instead of the carriage horses — and we hope we see the end of them very soon.'

She arrived outside the theatre accompanied by two men wearing horse masks. 

The charity is planning to lobby City Hall on November 13 for an immediate ban. 

However, Schindler's List star Liam Neeson has opposed idea, claiming the horses involved are well cared for.

Writing in the New York Times, he said: 'I have been a New York City resident for over 20 years, and have enjoyed Central Park for as long. As a horse lover, I grew up riding and caring for two horses every summer on my aunt’s small farm in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. I have continued to enjoy working with horses in a professional context over the years, appearing in a couple of Westerns and what I call “cowboys in armor” movies.

The $450,000 eCarriage can carry a maximum of eight passengers and features a vintage design

'I can appreciate a happy and well-cared-for horse when I see one. It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working. Horses have been pulling from the beginning of time. It is what they have been bred to do.'

NYCLASS said they have people who are willing and able to adopt every horse currently used in the carriage trade, and not one would be sent to the slaughter.

They claim the new eCarriages would provide work for the drivers. 

The prototype horseless eCarriage cost $450,000 and has a top speed of 30mph and a range of 100 miles. 

It is powered by a lithium ion battery, which would take six hours to recharge. 

The eCarriage debuted at the NYC Auto show in April.
