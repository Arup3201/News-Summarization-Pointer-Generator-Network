Killed: Kayla Peterson, 22, with her daughter

Three teenagers allegedly gunned down a 22-year-old mother after she told them to 'get a job' after they tried to get a cigarette from her boyfriend.

Kayla Peterson was shot at around 3pm on Saturday as she stood outside her home with her boyfriend, William Bailey.

Police are still searching for Todavia Cleckley and Marcus Velasquez, both aged 14,Â  who will be tried as adults for the murder in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania on Saturday afternoon.

A third boy, 13-year-old Kyle Goosby, is already in custody and has been charged with conspiracy to commit homicide.

Two of teenagers posted pictures of themselves brandishing guns on Facebook hours after the crime.

The
boys had followed Bailey from a nearby store asking for cigarettes and 
got into an argument with him and Peterson, according to court 
documents.

One teen pulled out a gun and fired a single shot, Beaver County police Chief Charles R. Jones Jr. told the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.

Ms Peterson, who had a young daughter, was flown to Allegheny General Hospital but died from a single gunshot wound to the abdomen two hours later.

'Words were exchanged and then gunfire,' Jones said. 'It's disheartening
juveniles this age were involved in an incident like this, and have 
guns.'

On Sunday, less than 12 hours after 
the shooting, a blurry photograph of two boys pointing guns at the 
camera was posted on Cleckley's Facebook page.

The
page already showed him posing with two guns - a semi-automatic pistol 
and a revolver - as the profile picture, which was uploaded last week. 
The page has now been taken down.

Jones told the Times Online
that the boys were 'no strangers to us. We've dealt with them before'. 
He added that he was not aware of the teenagers having contact with 
Peterson before the killing.

The boys have all had previous run ins with the police.

Velasquez, who has been involved with
at least five alleged incidents, is still awaiting a hearing for two 
disorderly conduct citations from November, the Times Online reported.

Cleckley pleaded guilty on November 8
to 
violation of compulsory school attendance and was fined, while Goosby 
has been found guilty of disorderly conduct and also fined.

Scene: The boys followed the couple home from this convenience store in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania

Investigation: Police cars surround the scene of the crime

Crime: The woman was then killed with a single shot to her abdomen outside her home, pictured

Velasquez is charged with criminal homicide, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and conspiracy to commit homicide in this latest crime. Cleckley is charged with conspiracy to commit homicide.

'They're armed and dangerous,' Chief Jones said. 'I'd like to see them off the street.'

Beaver County District Attorney Anthony Berosh said he will prosecute both teens as adults.
