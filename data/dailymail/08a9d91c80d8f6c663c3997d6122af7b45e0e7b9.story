There have been some weird and wacky kits down the years but two Spanish sides have released three contenders for the most unusual - with designs inspired by tuxedos, octopus tentacles and a pint of beer.

Segunda Division B side Cultural Leonesa arguably win the contest with a jersey designed to look like a tuxedo.

They will surely be suited and booted for the new season with the design being mainly black but opening up to resemble a white shirt, black buttons and black bow tie.

Suited and booted: Spanish Segunda Division B side Cultural Leonesa have unveiled a kit resembling a tuxedo

Looking smart: Leonesa will take to the pitch in the black design complete with bow tie and white shirt

Weird: Spanish Segunda Division side CD Lugo have also released some unusual kits for next season

Lager top: Lugo's home kit will resemble a pint of beer, inspired by their main sponsors Estrella Galicia

Wrap around: Lugo's away kit is all black with a huge octopus tentacle in honour of the Galician delicacy

CD Lugo meanwhile, who play a level higher in the Segunda Division, have unveiled two unusual kits.

Their home kit has been inspired by their main sponsors, beer company Estrella Galicia, and resembles a pint of lager with the main colour being amber and the top being white like the froth.

But their away kit is plain black and is adorned by a giant octopus tentacle in order to display one of the main cuisines of the region of Galicia in northwest Spain.

Changing style: Leonesa's kits (right) have traditionally been fairly normal and non-discript

Eccentric: Lugo's kit designs have traditionally been fairly loud but this year's have gone even further
