Carmelo Anthony has ended speculation over his NBA future by agreeing a new deal to stay with the New York Knicks.

The 30-year-old All-Star was linked with a move to a number of teams, including the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers, but decided to stay in New York.

The Knicks didn't release details of the new deal, but president Phil Jackson said in a statement: 'After three months of questions around 
Carmelo Anthony's return to the New York Knicks, we are now happy to 
know that we have the cornerstone of what we envision as a "team of 
excellence.'"

Knick at heart: Carmelo Anthony has agreed a new deal to stay with the New York Knicks

Jackson added: '(General manager) Steve Mills and I have
 assured Carmelo through our conversations, that we share the vision and
 the determination to build this team.'

Anthony will join the Knicks on their trip to London when they take on the Milwaukee Bucks at the O2 Arena on January 15.

The 
30-year-old was part of the USA team who won Olympic basketball gold at 
the London 2012 Games, and also travelled to England at the beginning of
 2013 when the Knicks brushed aside Detroit Pistons 102-87.

After committing his future to the Knicks, Anthony said: 'I am a New York Knick at heart. I am looking forward to continue my career in Orange & Blue and to work with Phil Jackson, a champion who builds championship teams. Madison Square Garden is the Mecca of basketball and I am surrounded by the greatest fans in the world.'

The future of Anthony and LeBron James had dominated the NBA free agency agenda after both confirmed that they would opt out of the final two years of their contracts with New York and Miami respectively.

However, after James announced he was returning home to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, Anthony also ended speculation about his future.

Anthony averaged 27.4 points last season for the Knicks, but will hope he can help improve the team's form after they missed out on the NBA play-offs.
