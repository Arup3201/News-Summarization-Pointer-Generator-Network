Britain's most senior civil servant has been lavishly wined and dined by energy chiefs and bankers.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood last year accepted hospitality from a series of bosses of major firms, calling into question his supposed neutrality.

As well as expensive dinners, he enjoyed trips to the opera, music recitals and private gallery visits.

Many of those with whom he dined, including energy firm Centrica and bankers Goldman Sachs, are directly affected by government policy.

The civil servant – dubbed Sir Cover-up after preventing the Iraq War inquiry from seeing messages between Tony Blair and George W Bush – also met people from a company set up by bankers from Morgan Stanley, where he used to work.

The meetings, reported in Private Eye, will cause concern that such businesses have too much influence among unelected mandarins in the corridors of power.

As the head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy is supposed to be scrupulously neutral. Critics will say it should be politicians – not Whitehall mandarins – meeting such figures.

Labour has promised a freeze on energy bills and has accused the Government of not being hard enough on the Big Six firms. Revelations that Sir Jeremy met with Centrica will only add to such accusations. In addition, the Government opposed European calls for a crackdown on bankers’ bonuses and the way the City operates – at a time when Sir Jeremy was meeting investment bankers and City lobbyists.

Last night Labour’s John Mann, of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘He would be better off meeting British lorry drivers in Calais, patients waiting for operations and victims of crime. It’s all too cosy at the top of government.’

Sir Jeremy is seen as David Cameron’s right-hand man, making sure policies get through, and was Tony Blair’s Principal Private Secretary from 1999 to 2003.

In May, it emerged Sir Jeremy had vetoed the release to the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War of letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George W Bush.

Contents of 150 messages – thought to reveal why Mr Blair dragged Britain into war – will be censored from the £10million inquiry, thanks to a backroom deal by Sir Jeremy. The latest official registers show that he is a prolific junketeer, happy to dine with powerful firms with a direct stake in government policy.

They reveal he enjoyed a dinner and music recital from Centrica, which owns British Gas – one of the firms lobbying against government efforts to clamp down on fuel bills. 

From Goldman Sachs Sir Jeremy accepted dinner, despite the fact HMRC was accused of letting the bank off over millions of pounds in tax thanks to a ‘sweetheart deal’.

He and wife Suzanne were treated to ‘refreshments, opera and dinner’ by Robertson Robey, an investment banking firm set up by bankers from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Sir Jeremy also went to the annual dinner of management consultancy McKinsey – where Mrs Heywood is a director.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said Sir Jeremy ‘acts at all times in compliance with the Civil Service Code’, adding: [He] meets a wide range of external contacts in the course of doing his job … Occasionally he attends breakfasts, lunches or dinners which are typically working occasions or charitable events.’
