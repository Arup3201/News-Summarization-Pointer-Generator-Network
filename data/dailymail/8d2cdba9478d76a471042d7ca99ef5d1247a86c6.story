A Fresno baby experienced life in the fast lane after being born on the way to hospital.

First-time mother Leigh Anna Gibbs delivered her son in the front seat of the car as her husband sped towards the hospital.

The couple thought they were in for a long night at the hospital when Mrs Gibbs went into labor, but 48 minutes later they were welcoming their son, Warner, to the world.

Quick delivery: Leigh Anna Gibbs at home with her baby, Warner, who was born in 48 minutes

'It was my first baby so the contractions were strong,' Mrs Gibbs said. 'Looking back I went from zero to ten in five minutes.'

Mrs Gibbs had to deliver Warner herself, with no pain relief, while her husband Sam frantically tried to reach Clovis Community Hospital in California.

She said: 'I told Sam, "I think 
I'm having this baby in the car" and he said, "You're fine, just take deep
breaths. We'll get there".'

But it was too late.

'At this time, the heads out and I'm 
like "Oh gosh let's get moving",' Mr Gibbs told ABC30. 'I ran a couple of red lights.'

As soon as their son was born, Mrs Gibbs says she 'scooped him up in my arms and put him up against my chest'.

The couple arrived at the emergency room a few minutes later.

'I just had such an adrenaline rush,' Mrs Gibbs said. I was so scared that he wasn't going to be OK. I didn't 
even think about the pain.'

Her unusual labor has not put the first-time mother off, however.

'Once we got to the hospital I told Sam this 
wasn't too bad I could do this again,' she said.

Although every pregnancy is different, labor usually lasts between 10 and 20 hours for a first-time mother. When a labor lasts three hours or less, it is known as precipitous or rapid labor.

While it is more common in women who have had children already, a precipitous labor is unusual for for first-time mothers.

Warner, who was born two weeks early, arrived so quickly that at first the couple's family did not believe he had arrived in 48 minutes.

'When I called my mom when we were in 
the hospital a couple of hours later and it was said and done she said, "No you're lying, stop it." And I finally had to tell her eight, or nine
times that no, we had a baby in 48 minutes,' Mr Gibbs said.

After Warner's dramatic entrance on May 13, the couple are now looking forward to moving down a gear and getting to know their new son.

Warner will also have a lasting reminder of his unusual entrance. On his birth certificate, under place of birth, it lists 'Automobile, Route 168', according to ABC30.
