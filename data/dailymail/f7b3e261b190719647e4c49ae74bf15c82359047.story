Britain’s most expensive tea room has gone on sale - but with an asking price of nearly £1million you'll need pots of money to afford it.

Along with the elegant seating area, the Grade II listed Georgian building in Topsham, Devon, boasts ten bedrooms, a courtyard and a walled flower garden. 

Run by husband and wife Heather and Gerald Knee, the understated property has featured on the BBC's Great British Menu and Escape To The Country.

For sale: Britain's most expensive tea room has gone on the market, in Devon, for £940,000

The stylish setting has also been voted 'Best Tea Room' by Devon Life magazine seven years in a row - and last year was awarded a Certificate of Excellence, while ranking well on Tripadvisor.

The building, which is on the market for £940,000, is being sold through Estate agency Saleboards.

A spokesman for the firm said: 'This fine property is a Grade II, three-storey, five-bayed, red brick house built in 1776, in the beautiful and very highly regarded town of Topsham.

'Currently used as a ten-bedroom guesthouse, this beautiful piece of Georgian architecture is multi-functional and would suit anyone searching for a fine and spacious property in the Topsham area.'

Mrs Knee, 70, said she was extremely sad to be saying goodbye to the 240-year-old building.

She said: 'I have met such lovely people and have been here for 25 years.

'My best experience was meeting Lynda Bellingham - she was travelling round the country visiting old houses. She was really interested in what we were doing and was so nice.

'Michael Caines also came down and I showed him how to make clotted cream - he said he was going to use it for one of his recipes.'

The couple have no idea what they will do next.

Mrs Knee added: 'It has become such a big part of our lives. We will need to get another little tea room.'

The property also features an entrance hall, two private living rooms and a basement.

In 1842, author F.W.L. Ross, who was a temporary resident at property, described the tea room as 'decidedly the best in the town'.

Little has changed. Among the reviews on Tripadvisor, one user says: 'Visited Topsham specifically for cream tea and it was amazing.

'The scones, clotted cream and jam were just divine. Tea was also great, and the cups it came in were adorable. Really great atmosphere. Highly recommended.' 

Topsham is around four miles from the cathedral city of Exeter and was once one of the largest ports in the area before Exeter's ship canal was constructed in the mid 16th century.

The harbour was once an important centre of cotton importing and the town maintains strong maritime links with its sailing club and several quays along the river.
