Broadchurch star Eve Myles says that she is happier than she has ever been being mother to her two daughters 

Eve, mother to Matilda, five, and 10-month-old Siena, said: 'If I had my way, I'd keep going until I couldn't have any more. I love being a mum. It's been the making of me.

'I am a bit of a home bird. I like to get back even if it's just to give the girls a good-night cuddle. 

'I just love the simple things - making dinner, bath time and waking up in the mornings and seeing them.' 

From appearing in Torchwood and Merlin, she is now playing  Claire Ripley in the second series of the popular crime drama.

But she almost missed out on the part and says she had no idea they were casting because she was lost 'in pregnancy world'.

So in a last minute attempt to get the part she filmed an audition from her home in Cardiff on Bradley's mobile phone.

'The whole thing was just hilarious, with the baby, we'd literally had no sleep that night,' she said.

'It was a nightmare with me trying to read these lines from a scene with her crying.'

It's no wonder that Eve was 'surprised' when she got called to London to meet the crew behind the smash hit show which stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman.

She said: 'I spent most of the time on the train in the toilets using a breast pump and arrived there with about seven bottles of milk.

'It was bizarre. But in some ways, it was the perfect time. I suffer so terribly with nerves but because I was so tired, I didn't have a nerve in me.'

During filming Eve brought baby Siena on to the set in Dorset with her but most days involved waking up at 3.30am to make the drive to the west country and driving home again by 7pm.

In the show Eve plays Claire Ripley, she says she loves the simple things in life like cooking dinner and looking after her children
