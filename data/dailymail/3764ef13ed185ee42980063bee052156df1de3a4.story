The decisive World Cup clash between Germany and the USA will be played despite two months’ worth of rainfall hitting Recife in one night.

Flash floods have transformed the streets into a apocalyptic scene, as 42,000 supporters attempt to navigate their way to the Estadio Pernambuco, with fans deserting their vehicles and walking miles to make it in time for kick off on Thursday evening.

As things stand, FIFA insist that the match will go ahead and Uzbekistani referee Ravshan Irmatov has inspected the pitch and passed it fit to play ahead of the game between Jurgen Klinsmann’s US outfit and his native Germany.

Stadium officials decided the conditions do not place supporters in danger, despite the deluge showing little sign of easing up as kick off approaches.

The path leading directly to the stadium is clear but the challenge facing supporters is to break through the gridlock in the city that is slowing down access.

A draw will take both sides through to the knockout stages but defeat for the USA could hand an opportunity for Portugal or Ghana, who play at the same time in Recife, to capitalise and earn a place in the next round.

Ghana’s plans for this evening’s decisive World Cup clash against Portugal have been catapulted into chaos after two players – Sulley Muntari and Kevin Prince Boateng – were suspended indefinitely and ordered home.
