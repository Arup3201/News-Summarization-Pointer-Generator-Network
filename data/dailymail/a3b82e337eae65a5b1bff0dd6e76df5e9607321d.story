Richard Hammond (pictured) raved about the Porsche 911 GT3, saying it was 'so good, I had to buy one myself'

Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond is being warned not to use his brand new Porsche after two of the limited edition £100,000 sports cars mysteriously burst into flames.

Hammond, 44, is known for his love of all things Porsche but is among the 100 British  911 GT3 owners who have been warned not to drive their supercars by the German manufacturer.

Hammond, nicknamed 'Hamster', recently wrote of his love for the GT3, saying it was 'so good, I had to buy one myself'. But just a few weeks after he made the comments Porsche has put a halt on deliveries and recommended owners of the 196mph cars stop driving them.

The shock move comes after two of the European sports cars caught fire without explanation - prompting James May and Jeremy Clarkson to ridicule their mate, who had just taken delivery of his car.

Porsche has now released a statement about the potential issue with its flagship 911.

A spokesman said: 'Porsche is informing the owners of the affected vehicles directly and recommending that they stop using their vehicles.

'The company is offering to pick up the vehicles and take them to a Porsche Centre immediately.

'Safety is the number one priority at Porsche, and the company takes its responsibility seriously.'

Hammond is one of around 100 Brits left without their cars while an investigation into the model takes place, although the presenter does have a garage full of other supercars to choose from.

The Porsche 911 GT3 can go from 0-62mph in just 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 196mph

When the pint-sized presenter road-tested the Porsche 911 GT3 he said 'there are no bad points about this car'.

However, two models have since burst into flames on the continent.

But Porsche are not the only manufacturer to experience this kind of trouble.

In 2010 Ferrari were forced to recall almost 1,250 of its 458 Italias after a number of the supercars caught fire.

The Porsche 911 GT3 was unveiled last year and to buy it new costs £100,540 including VAT.

It has a manual six-speed gearbox and is powered by a 3.8-litre flat six engine developing 475bhp.

The Porsche can go from 0-62mph in just 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 196mph.

It is four-and-a-half metres long and 1.9 metres wide

It also gets a surprisingly efficient 23 miles to the gallon meaning with a standard 16.9 gallon tank it could go 388 miles between fuel stops.

The 911 GT3 will also lap the legendary 
Nurburgring in less than 7 minutes 30 seconds.
