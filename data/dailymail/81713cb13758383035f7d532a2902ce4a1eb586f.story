These extraordinary pictures give a glimpse into the daily lives of the women who form an all-female battalion, which provides aid and security in war-torn Aleppo in Syria. 

Pictured as they sit in shooting positions and walking the streets in uniform, the women operate as a full military unit as well as managing two field hospitals for injured fighters.

But one woman is seen performing ordinary tasks like crocheting while working in a hospital and others hold up the peace sign as they pose for pictures in cars.

The group of women - known as the Mother Aisha battalion - took up arms to support the Free Syrian Army in the fight against President Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria's civil war. 

The women who make up this force operate as fighters on the Old Aleppo frontline, but are also in charge of two medical field hospitals and a police station for women detainees. 

Armed and dressed in full camouflage, the members patrol the streets of Aleppo alongside their male counterparts.

Earlier this week, at least 19 people were killed by Syrian rebel fire on government-controlled parts of Aleppo.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the dead included at least five children, three of whom were killed with their mother when a rocket hit the car they were in.

The Britain-based group said at least 32 people were also wounded in Thursday night's rocket attack in the western part of the city.

And on Friday, three people including a pregnant woman were killed by a ground-to-ground missile fired by government forces at a rebel district in eastern Aleppo, the Observatory said.

Aleppo was once Syria's economic hub, but the city has been ravaged by fighting that began in middle of 2012.

The city is divided with government forces controlling the western part and rebels controlling the east.

However, government forces have advanced steadily around the eastern outskirts of the city, threatening to besiege opposition-held districts.

More than 200,000 people have reportedly been killed in Syria since the beginning of the conflict in March 2011.

Responsible for providing aid and security, the group, controlled by the Free Syrian Army, carry weapons as they walk the streets of Aleppo
