These newborns looks like they belong in the nursery of Downton Abbey as they nod off - head-to-toe in 1920s dress.

The babies are each  dressed in outfits straight from the Jazz age.

The images were all captured by photographer Neli Prahova, who spends up to three hours at a time moulding the infants into each position.

Londoner Neli Prahova spends up to three hours positioning babies in the pictures. They are easiest to work with at ten days old, as they mostly sleep. Neli then decorates them with 1920s accessories

Bulgarian-born Neli, 32, from London, said: 'I absolutely love Downton Abbey so it was lovely to recreate the era with each outfit. 

'I think they look just the part and would fit right in on set. You could really see them in the Downton nursery with George and Cybil.'

Neli researches every detail in depth and uses numerous household items to perfect the looks, including paper plates, bottle caps, scarves, cut-out flowers and vintage pearls.

She said: 'Taking the pictures is quite a lengthy process but finding the props takes much longer.'

All of the babies in Neli's work are around 10 days old because they sleep a lot of the time and their limbs can be positioned in poses

She continued: 'You have to get every item exactly right so that the pictures have the right look and feel.

'I constantly keep an eye on props that I might use for new ideas. It's all about the idea and then you start brainstorming.'

She said: 'You're told never to work with animals or children, but newborn babies can actually be remarkably easy to work with.

'They can be asleep or awake really and because they haven't learned how to roll over yet, they're quite happy to lie in a certain position.

Neli takes her inspiration from Anne Geddes and Adele Enersen - both of whom are renowned for their quirky baby photography projects

She continued: 'But with newborns, it's all about patience as it takes often a long time to rock them into sleep in order to take those photos.'

Neli, who takes her inspiration from Anne Geddes and Adele Enersen - both of whom are renowned for their quirky baby photography projects - said she combines her photography expertise and being a mother to create the newborn images. 

The mother-of-one said: 'The images make perfect souvenirs and gifts for friends and family.

'I started taking photos as a hobby when I was 14, and when I turned professional I mainly focused on wedding photography.'

She continued: 'But when I became a mother myself two-and-a-half years ago, I could feel my creative desires changing, urging me to use my new skills as a parent to create wonderful images that other new parents would treasure forever.'

Alongside her Downton Abbey images, Neli has also created more collections of baby photography, from traditional poses with blankets and pillows, to bees, angels, and also Santa.

She added: 'I wanted to do something different and it's fun to involve babies who have got the cute factor.

'The images bring a lot of joy to parents, and although it can be a challenge at times, I really do love my job.'
