Labour has drawn up plans to ‘decapitate’ the Liberal Democrats by ousting Nick Clegg from Parliament at the next election.

Ed Miliband yesterday issued a humiliating public rebuff to the Lib Dem leader after he hinted he would like to form a coalition with Labour after the next election.

And a source on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee told the Daily Mail the party was now ‘pouring resources’ into Mr Clegg’s Sheffield Hallam constituency in a bid to get him booted out by the voters next year.

‘We are going to go after Clegg hard,’ the source said. ‘We are already pouring resources in because although he’s got a big majority it is very soft.

'A lot of them are students and there is a huge amount of anger locally about the Coalition’s cuts.’

Another Labour source said the party was aiming to produce a ‘Portillo moment’ - a reference to Michael Portillo’s shock defeat at the 1997 election which ruled him out of the subsequent Conservative leadership contest.

The revelation threatens to plunge relations between Mr Clegg and Mr Miliband into the deep freeze at a time when the Lib Dem leader is trying to reach out to Labour about the possibility of forming a coalition after next year’s election.

In an interview for a BBC Radio 4 documentary broadcast yesterday Mr Clegg said Labour had ‘changed’ and suggested the party was becoming more responsible on the economy.

The Lib Dem leader was also scathing about his Tory coalition partners, saying they had lurched to the right and lost touch with the concerns of ordinary voters.

‘They’ve become much more ideological,’ he said. ‘They’ve returned much more to a lot of their familiar theme tunes.

‘I think it would be best for everybody if the Conservative Party were to rediscover a talent for actually talking to mainstream voters about mainstream concerns.’ Mr Miliband yesterday rejected Mr Clegg’s overtures, saying he was focused on securing a Labour victory next year.

‘I think what I’m looking for is a majority Labour government,’ he said. ‘There are such big issues that the country faces, I think Nick Clegg should be worried about the Liberal Democrats.’ When pushed on whether he would consider a coalition with the Lib Dems, Mr Miliband said: ‘I don’t think the parties, in advance of elections, should be engaging in this. I think what they should be engaging in is how are we going to change the country? What are we offering the country? And that’s what I’m interested in.’

Many senior Labour figures see Mr Clegg as an obstacle to a potential coalition deal. They argue it would be impossible for a man who has propped up a Conservative Prime Minister for five years to ever be accepted into a Labour-led government.

Previous efforts: The last party to attempt a 'decapitation strategy' was the Lib Dems, who tried to oust the then Tory leader Michael Howard during the 2005 election

Removing Mr Clegg from Parliament would force him to quit as Lib Dem leader, leaving Labour to deal with a more palatable figure if the election produces another hung parliament.

Mr Clegg has one of the safest Lib Dem seats in the country, with a majority of 15,000. Labour has never won the seat.

But the constituency also has one of the highest concentrations of student voters in the country. Labour believes many of them remain furious with Mr Clegg for his betrayal over student tuition fees.

Ironically the last party to attempt a ‘decapitation strategy’ was the Lib Dems, who tried to oust the then Tory leader Michael Howard and senior figures, including David Davis and Oliver Letwin at the 2005 election.

The initiative was largely unsuccessful after Tory activists flooded the targeted constituencies to shore up their vote.
