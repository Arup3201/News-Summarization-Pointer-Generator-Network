A blogger has claimed that the Youtube video showing an eagle 'swooping in' on a toddler and trying to fly off with him is a hoax.

The viral video is the work of some creative students at the Montreal-based Centre NAD.

A blog post owned up to the fact that the video was the work of pupils studying the school's 3D Animation and Digital Design program.

In the video, a massive golden eagle circles a park before swooping down and appearing to grab a toddler with its claws and trying to fly off with him.

Scroll down for video

The eagle - with a roughly six-foot wing span - was videoed apparently snatching the toddler and lifting it a few feet off the ground

This grainy close-up shows how the huge feathered beast, one of the world's deadliest birds of prey, appears to get hold of the youngster

The clip shows the child's parent looking on in horror as the
feathered beast, one of the world's deadliest birds of prey, apparently
snatches the boy and lifts him a few feet off the ground.

Footage then shows the eagle dropping 
the child, whose name and age are unknown, on the grass a few feet away.
However, YouTube posters Suggested the video is an elaborate hoax with 
several claiming to have proved it's a fake.

The students took to a blog to explain how they fooled their astonished audience.

'Both the eagle and the kid were created in 3D animation and integrated into the film afterwards,' the school wrote, revealing that students Normand Archambault, Loic Mireault and Felix Marquis-Poulin were behind the clip.

Youtube user lonelygirl15 fooled fans into thinking on a videoblog about the life of teenager Bree Avery was real - when actually it was the work of a 19-year-old actress named Jessica Rose.

Hoaxers convinced many people into plugging their iPod charger into an onion, dazzling them some questionable 'scientific facts' to persuade them you could charge an Apple with the vegetable

A tearful confession about a love for cats by a woman called Debbie drew a huge - if mocking - audience. But dating website eHarmony admitted the heartfelt tribute was a hoax.

'The production simulation workshop 
class, offered in fifth semester, aims to produce creative projects 
according to industry production and quality standards,' the blog added.

The Centre boasts that it has trained more than 1,500 CGI professionals since it opened its doors in 1992.

This isn’t the first time Centre 
NAD’s work has created a buzz: students in the program have previously 
created hoax videos that have also gone viral, including one showing an 
escaped penguin from the Montreal Biodome.

Video of the apparent incident starts with footage of the eagle - with a roughly six-foot wing span - flying over a public park in Montreal, Canada.

But when the eagle swoops down the French-speaking man filming the incident zooms in.

After swearing in English, he races over to comfort the bewildered child, who starts crying but does not appear to have been seriously hurt.

'A golden eagle tries to snatch a baby in Montreal! What if he got away with it!?' reads a caption under the video, posted by MrNuclearCat.

The video had more than five million views by Wednesday evening.

However, many YouTube posters were already suspicious before the blog revealed it was a fake, realising that it was a CGI hoax.

One user Cyatek 
broke the video down and claimed special effects were used to fake it and there is lack of shadow in some frames.

The golden eagle is the largest bird 
of prey in North America, and can dive at its quarry at speeds of more 
than 150 miles per hour, according to the U.S. National Geographic 
Society.

The clip starts with footage of a golden eagle flying over a public park in Canada

The camera follows the eagle as it swoops down near the ground, and towards a child, seen here in the centre

This is the moment the giant eagle grabs the child by his winter coat as he sits on the grass in a park

Incredibly, the bird takes off with the child in its claws, lifting it a couple of feet off the ground. At this point the parent hasn't noticed

Horrifying: The parent notices and and tries to run after the eagle, but there is little anyone can do

The eagle, pictured showing it's huge wingspan, loosens its grip on the child and drops it from a few feet in the air

Back down to earth: The child falls down onto the grass as the eagle, who must have mistaken the little boy for prey, flies off

After the incident: Thankfully the child wasn't seriously hurt by the eagle, although the child does look shaken
