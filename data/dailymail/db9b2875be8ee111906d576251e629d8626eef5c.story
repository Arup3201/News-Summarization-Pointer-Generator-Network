A woman who spent eight years battling infertility has received an incredible Christmas present after delivering four healthy baby girls.

The two sets of identical twins - Indie, Esme, Scarlett and Evangeline - were born on Sunday to Ashley and Tyson Gardner by Cesarean section in the 29th week of pregnancy.

The babies were delivered at 5pm and weighed around 2lbs each. Proud father Tyson posted that the new mom and four daughters 'were doing incredible' after the birth which was a one-in-70-million chance.

Mr Gardner, from Pleasant Grove, Utah, also thanked the doctors and nurses who delivered the babies.  

The couple have been sharing messages on a Facebook page charting the pregnancy, saying they are 'overjoyed' and that all four girls appear to have inherited their father's dark hair. 

The Gardners also shared that they will be featured on a TV series on the TLC network about the pregnancy, birth of their 'quad squad' and adventures over the coming months. 

Mr Gardner wrote: 'We can’t wait to have you all along on this journey!'

Doctors made the decision to deliver the babies by C-section after Ashley started experiencing  contractions early on Sunday.

The couple became an internet sensation after they made a video earlier this year showing their startled but ecstatic reaction to the news that they had four babies on the way.

Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by their friend, Alicia Hallock, and later uploaded online.

Footage shows the couple gazing open-mouthed at the screen, before Mrs Gardner places her hand on her forehead and breathes out. 

The pair then start laughing in delight, while the mother-to-be holds up scans of her four babies.  

The couple posted a picture shortly before the birth with the message: 'Santa let the elves take over for a bit today so he could come visit us in the hospital!! #happy29weeks'

Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets. 

The couple wrote in a Facebook post: 'We were so blessed to be able to do IVF the month of June! They put 2 eggs back and both split! That's right, we are having quadruplets! The odds of both eggs splitting are literally 1 in 1 million.' 

Since then, the couple have posted regular updates on the progress of the pregnancy, including themed snaps of Ashley in costume for Halloween and Christmas.  

The quadruplets' survival was called a 'miracle' after emergency surgery was needed to stop  contractions when Ashley was around 20 weeks pregnant.

The couple flew to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery in late October.

Doctors managed to stave off the earlier delivery after an intense operation, which allowed the unborn babies vital extra weeks to bolster their chances of survival. 

Mr Gardner said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. 

Surgeons also managed to cure two of the girls of their twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which could have resulted in developmental problems.

In October, the Gardners posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, ''This has been a good day!''

'Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!!' 

The couple, who say the babies are doing 'great' and receiving 'fabulous care', have promised more updates when possible.
