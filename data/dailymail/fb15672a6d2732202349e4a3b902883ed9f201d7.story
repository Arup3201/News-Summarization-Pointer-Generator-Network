Harrison Ford may have been survived Thursday's plane crash without life-threatening injury, but the actor's distraught wife is now urging him to take the hint and stay grounded permanently after his lucky escape.

Ford has a passion for flying, but wife of five years, Calista Flockhart, 50, is strongly urging her 72-year-old husband that now is the time to call it quits because he might not be so fortunate next time.

Ford suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured pelvis and broken ankle, when he crash landed his 1940s aircraft onto a Californian golf course, but he is expected to make a full recovery.

'Calista is devastated. Thank goodness Harrison is OK but it could have been much, much worse,' a friend of the actress told The Mirror.

'It is a worry for her and his children that he has this dangerous hobby. 

'Whether or not he will pilot a plane again remains to be seen but everyone around him certainly hopes he will take a break – or give it up for ever. It is ­obviously a huge worry.'

Flockhart isn't the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend, Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher has also urged him to 'take a break' following his plane crash and take it easy.

Addressing Harrison, she told PEOPLE magazine: 'I know you have incredible bounce back, please take a bounce break for awhile. Can I drive next time?' 

Fisher, who plays Princess Leia in the films, told The Mail on Sunday that she had a car smash in Los Angeles last Sunday – and now fears that one of her other co-stars will also suffer an accident.

'Things happen in threes,' she said. 'I'm about to call Mark Hamill [who plays Luke Skywalker] to make sure he's OK. I have a horrid feeling there's a curse going on here.'

Ford, 72, remained in hospital last night after crashing his vintage single-engine plane on Thursday. It is believed he suffered a pelvic fracture, ankle injuries, and multiple bruises and cuts.

The superstar was hailed as a hero for avoiding a densely populated area of Los Angeles after the engine failed. He brought the plane down on a golf course.

Fisher, 58, met Ford when they starred in the original Star Wars film in 1977, in which he played daredevil Han Solo.

They have remained close friends and appear in the next instalment of the franchise. It was filmed in the UK last summer and is due for release in December.

Fisher, who is known for her eccentric views on life, said: 'What is funny is that last Sunday it was raining hard in LA. I was driving to the art store and I got into an accident.

'It wasn't that serious and I wasn't hurt but it's the first car accident I've ever had. I drove home and that's when the wheel came off my BMW. My assistant told me I could have died if the wheel had come off when I was on the freeway.'

Laughing, she added: 'Then I was watching the news and saw Harrison had his crash.

'I'm a bit worried it's the curse of Star Wars.

'The thing about Harrison is that he's always the coolest dude in the room. He just oozes manly manliness. I'm not surprised he landed the plane in one piece and survived.'

Fisher has not spoken to Ford since the crash, but has sent him some beer. She explained that on one occasion they were planning to fly together. 'I was messing around and he said, 'Look, do you want to fly or can we have a beer?'

'He wouldn't have a drink if we were going to fly. It became something of a joke between us that I chose to have a beer that time rather than fly. I sent him some beers to the hospital with the message, 'You should have had a beer this time.'

She added: 'He's primal. As a woman you feel safe with him. I fully expect he will be back up there soon – even if he's told he's not allowed to. Harrison isn't someone who follows the normal rules.'

According to the Los Angeles Times, Ford is 'uninsurable'. In 1999 the father of five crashed his helicopter in the desert north of Los Angeles after the motor failed. A year later he was forced to crash-land a plane in Nebraska.

Fisher said Ford's accident last summer on the set of Star Wars VII – when the door of the Millennium Falcon dropped on to his leg, shattering it – was 'more serious than was let on'.

She added: 'It could have been billions of times worse.'
