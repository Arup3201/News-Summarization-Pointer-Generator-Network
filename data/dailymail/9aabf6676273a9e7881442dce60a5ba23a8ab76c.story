The former mayor of Bucharest has said he is facing ruin after a property he rented out in the Romanian capital was allegedly turned into an illegal brothel by its tenants.

Viorel Lis, founder of the nationalistic New Generation Party, and his wife Oana were initially targeted by police after officers discovered the building was being used as a massage parlour and brothel.

They were dropped from the investigation however after police said it became clear the couple were unaware what the property was being used for.

The mayor, 70, and his wife, 35, have now said they are facing ruin after the police raided the property.

The couple have said the loss of revenue from lack of rent income and the money spent on repairing the building has driven them to the brink of ruin, according to Central European News.

Mr Lis is also said to have been made ill with stress and worry.

Mrs Lis said: 'We are really broke, of course the best thing to do to get some money coming into our bank account would be to rent it again, but it's all in such a mess and with no electricity or water we don't even have that option.

'It's a struggle to survive now, I never thought it would get to a situation where our only income was my husband's meagre pension. 

'I am even allowing my image to be used to promote a hairdressing salon just so that we can both get our hair done for free. It really is a nightmare.' 

The electricity and gas in the property has been cut off after the tenants failed to keep up with the payments.

The pair became famous for their fancy dress costumes in the past, including Shrek and Princess Fiona

Mr Lis is a regular figure in the Romanian media, while he and his wife were a regular fixture on Bucharest's social scene, also often appearing on television.

The pair were particularly famous for their fancy dress costumes in the past, including Shrek and Fiona, Morticia and Fester from the Addams Family, Spiderman and Wonderwoman and Fred and Wilma Flintstone.
