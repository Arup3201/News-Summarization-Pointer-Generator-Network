Real Madrid are stepping up interest in Liverpool midfield prospect Pedro Chirivella.

The Spain U18 captain was signed by Liverpool from Valencia a year ago when he was 16, beating off competition from Madrid and Barcelona as they struck a compensation deal for a bargain £200,000.

Chirivella has been compared to his idol, former Madrid and Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso, and has been training with Liverpool’s first team this season.

The holding midfielder has figured in Liverpool’s UEFA Youth League squads also where Madrid have tracked his progress. 

Chirivella was signed by former academy director Frank McParland, now at Brentford, who nicknamed the 17-year-old ‘the computer’ for his ability to select the right pass and read the game. He is on a four year deal at Liverpool and is highly regarded.

European champions Madrid though are on a recruitment drive aimed at improving the quality in their youth set-up.

They have agreed a deal for Ajax forward Mink Peeters, 16, they are signing one-time West Ham target Marco Asensio from Real Mallorca and are confident of beating Manchester United and Liverpool to Norway’s !5-year-old Martin Odegaard of Stromsgodset.

Spaniard Chirivella though is their next target and Liverpool will do well to resist what bids arrive in the coming weeks.
