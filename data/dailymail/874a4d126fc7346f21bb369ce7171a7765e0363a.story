North Korea today called the use of its flag during U.S.-South Korean military drills last week a serious provocation and evidence of U.S. hostility that justifies the growth of Pyongyang's nuclear arms program.

The statement from an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman came on the 62nd anniversary of the start of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, leaving the Korean Peninsula still technically at war.

Animosity between the rival Koreas and between Pyongyang and Washington has deepened since a North Korean rocket launch in April that Seoul and Washington called a cover for a test of banned long-range missile technology.

North Korea says the rocket, which broke apart shortly after lift-off, was meant to put a satellite into orbit.

Pyongyang has since threatened to 
attack Seoul's conservative government and media if it doesn't get an 
apology for perceived insults against the country and its new, young 
leader, Kim Jong Un.

The U.S.-South Korean drills on Friday 
were the allies' biggest since the Korean War, and South Korean military
officials called them a warning to North Korea. A huge North Korean 
flag on a hill disappeared behind flames and smoke as South Korean jets 
and U.S. helicopters fired rockets. The flag wasn't hit.

'It is an extremely grave military 
action and politically-motivated provocation to fire live bullets and 
shells at the flag of a sovereign state without a declaration of war,' 
said the North's statement, which was dated Sunday but was released by 
the official Korean Central News Agency early today.

The Foreign Ministry spokesman called 
the North's nuclear program 'an all-powerful treasured sword for 
preventing a war and reliably protecting peace and stability on the 
Korean Peninsula'.

North Korea 'will further bolster up 
its nuclear deterrent for self-defense as long as the U.S., the world's 
biggest nuclear weapons state, persists in its hostile policy'.

The drills on Friday coincided with 
several days of joint naval exercises involving the nuclear-powered 
aircraft supercarrier USS George Washington and separate U.S., South 
Korean and Japanese naval rescue drills.

On Sunday, F-18 flights arrived and departed every few minutes on the carrier as a light drizzle fell over choppy seas.

During a ceremony in Seoul, South 
Korean Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik said his country 'must focus on 
strengthening our national defense and security awareness in order to 
prevent another Korean War from happening again'.

Opening fire: The drills on the North Korean border involved jet fighters, tanks, Apache attack helicopters, A-10 'tank-killer' aircraft, missiles and multiple rocket launchers.
