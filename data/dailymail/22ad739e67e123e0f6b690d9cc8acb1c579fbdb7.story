The wife of former German president Christian Wulff is taking legal action to prevent Google from spreading rumours that she once worked as an escort girl.

Web users who type Bettina Wulff’s name into Google’s search engine receive suggestions including ‘prostitute’, ‘escort’ and ‘red-light district’.

Rumours were reportedly circulated by political opponents of her husband, who resigned in February following a loan scandal.

Bettina Wulff, the wife of former German president Christian Wulff is taking legal action to prevent Google from spreading rumours that she once worked as an escort girl

'I was never employed as an escort,' Mrs. Wulff swore in her statement at her attorney’s office in Hamburg.

A click on the German version of Google throws up numerous references to 'call girl,' 'red light,' 'prostitute' and 'escort' in relation to Mrs. Wulff.

The case is unique in Germany in being the first lawsuit ever launched by a former first lady in a bid to salvage her reputation.

German and foreign bloggers - as well as 34 media outlets in Germany - have signed declarations over the past few months pledging to cease and desist from citing such allegations after strongly worded letters were despatched from Mrs. Wulff’s legal team.

Her lawyers said; 'In recent months 
many publishers, journalists and Internet activists desisted immediate 
upon request, without even trying to justify the false representations'.

It is understood everal media outlets have had to pay compensation to the tune of tens of thousands of euros to her.

Her
lawsuit is also aimed at German chat show and Who Wants to be a 
Millionaire host Guenter Jauch who refused to sign the declaration never
to mention the red-light rumours.

Jauch denied he ever slandered her 
and pointed out that the reference he made to her on air was credited to
the newspaper it appeared in.

And Google on Sunday said it will fight her bid to censor it.

Kay
Oberbeck, spokeswoman for Google Northern Europe, said the displayed 
terms about her are 'algorithmically-generated result of objective 
factors, including the popularity of the entered search terms'.

Google has already faced five similar cases in Germany - and won them all

She said Google 'is not proposing these terms - all terms that appear have been previously entered by Google users.'

Google has already faced five similar cases in Germany - and won them all.

While Mrs. Wulff might want to erase any mention of her past, her present situation meant she woke up on Sunday plastered over the newspapers in her homeland because of the legal moves.

Jauch’s TV show had quoted a newspaper article regarding the rumours in Berlin and Jauch had also questioned the deputy editor of the mass-circulation newspaper Bild about the affair.

The lawsuit states that in Wulff’s view, Jauch had 'played a central role... in the destruction of her reputation.'

The lawsuit against Google aims to stop words such as 'red-light past,' 'prostitute' or 'escort' appearing as search suggestions when Bettina Wulff’s name is entered in the search window.

Wulff will also try to counter the allegations when she publishes a book about her life this month,

The Sueddeutsche newspaper said its investigations had revealed that Christian Democratic Union circles in Hanover started spreading the rumours in 2006 to target her husband who was state premier of Lower Saxony at the time.

The rumours spread multiplied in the days leading up to his taking the presidential post in 2010 with several news outlets taking them seriously.

Wulff resigned this February after a string of money-related allegations came to light – including that in 2008 while he was Lower Saxony state premier, he failed to declare a soft loan of €500,000 from a prominent regional businessmen.

The Wulffs were married in March 2008, two months before the birth of their son, Linus. Bettina Wulff, who had studied media management in Hannover, worked as a publicist before becoming Germany’s First Lady.

A ruling about the validity of her lawsuit is expected at the Hamburg State Court within weeks.

Typing in ‘Bettina Wulff’ on to Google.de, autocompletes the search with terms like 'escort' and 'prostitute.'

In fact it throws up ‘prostitute, escort and past’ before a single search term has been entered.

Of such ‘hits’ there are an astonishing 61,800 for prostitute, 1.46 MILLION for ‘rotlicht’ - red light - and 157,000 for her ‘past.’

The allegations were a source of routine gossip in political and media circles for years; one rumour which did the rounds was that Wulff met her when he hired her for the evening as an ‘escort.’

Some media outlets have published details of the place where she was supposed to have worked - and she claims she never was employed in such a manner.

A court in Hamburg is considering Mrs Wulff’s claim.
