A one-time den of iniquity has been transformed into a house of worship by a determined pastor and an army of church volunteers.

Platinum Showgirls was shut down in 2009 after it was raided by a SWAT team and found to be selling drugs and allowing dancers to charge for sex acts.

The club was left abandoned in Boynton Beach, Florida and had become an eyesore until the  Evangelical Assembly of Christ stepped in.

The 250-strong congregation spent $100,000 fixing up the place - tearing out stripper poles, painting a fresh color scheme and laying carpets. 

Pastor Dumont Pierre told News Channel 5: 'It was dark when we came here. But with our Bibles in hand, our Bible was our leader.'

The church leader of the mostly Haitian congregation also planned to start a youth group to keep teenagers off the street.

Prayers answered: The 250-strong community volunteered for a year to work on their church

Warfield Alexandre, 24, is an active member of the church but used to sneak into the venue in his teens.

He told local news: 'There would be like a little bar on this side and then on this side there would be DVDs of pornography, CDs and everything.'

The city has praised the efforts of the church for taking a vacant and rundown building and bringing it back to life.
