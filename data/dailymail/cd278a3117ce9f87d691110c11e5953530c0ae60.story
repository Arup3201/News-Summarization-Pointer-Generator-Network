World champion boxer Floyd Mayweather has taken down a controversial Facebook post where he shared his ex-fiancée’s alleged sonogram and claimed that he broke up with her because she got an abortion.

Mayweather posted the photo of the sonogram to his Facebook and Instagram accounts Wednesday before receiving thousands of negative comments and taking it down.

'The real reason me and Shantel Christine Jackson @missjackson broke up was because she got a abortion (sic), and I'm totally against killing babies. She killed our twin babies. #ShantelJackson#FloydMayweather#TheMoneyTeam#TMT' he wrote as the caption.

Outrageous: Floyd Mayweather posted this photo of a sonogram- the details of which have been blurred by MailOnline but states that it shows multiple fetuses- and he claimed that it was that of his ex Shantel Jackson

TMZ took a grab of the Instagram posting and Jezebel has a screenshot of the Facebook post where the comments of outraged fans are visible.

Mayweather and Shantel Jackson dated for four years and got engaged in 2013 when he proposed with a $10million ring.

In April, the undefeated boxer who has signed a deal that will net him $200million, he announced that they were calling off their engagement.

'You always want a strong, beautiful woman that you can share your everything with. But I have to go my separate way (sic),' he told MLive at the time.

Retaliation: Jackson promptly posted this photo of her and Nelly, effectively confirming that they are in the beginning of a relationship which had been rumored in the days leading up to Mayweather's posting of the sonogram

Bitter punch: Mayweather responded to the Nelly pictured by posting this undated shot of Jackson- before taking it down

Pointed response: Jackson posted this clear message on Thursday afternoon

'She's focusing on her career in L.A.,
 which is acting. And I'm focusing on my career, which is boxing. 
Sometimes people can outgrow one another, but we're still friends.'

Relations
 between the two seem to have gotten significantly more tense as Jackson
 effectively confirmed that she is now dating Nelly, the rapper, by 
posting an intimate shot of the two of them Thursday morning- just hours
 after Mayweather shared the sonogram.

'Look
 up MO say cheese... Lol You encourage me to smile and laugh through all
 my BS. Thank You. #Realfriend P.S You are truly a comedian. LMAO... 
!!!' she wrote as a caption to the photo, which has Jackson giving a 
smirk to the camera while Nelly looks down towards her.

Sparking rumors: Nelly brought Shantel Jackson to the Charlotte Bobcats game against the Miami Heat on Monday, which was their first public outing amid speculation of their relationship

Causing speculation: Jackson posted this cryptic Twitter message after being spotted at the game in Charlotte

Rumors of a relationship
 between Jackson and the rapper began when Nelly allegedly posted a 
photo of the model as his 'Woman Crush Wednesday'. That photo has since 
been taken down.

Hip 
Hollywood reports that they were then seen together at the Miami Heat 
basketball game against the Charlotte Bobcats on Monday.

Mayweather couldn't help but throw 
another (photographic) punch, and three hours after Jackson shared the 
intimate snap, he posted an old photo of her where he claimed to have 
paid for undisclosed plastic surgery for his ex- that he now wants back.

He has since taken this 
photo down as well, but Hip Hollywood took a grab of it and reported 
that the caption read: '#tbt @missjackson Before all the plastic surgery
 I had to pay for. I’m a Indian giver I want my money back LOL 
#ShantelJackson #FloydMayweather #TheMoneyTeam #PlasticSurgery #TMT'.

Earlier times: Mayweather proposed to Jackson (pictured in both photos) in
 April 2012 with a ring estimated to cost $10million and they 
didn't break up until this April (pictured in April 2012, left, and September 2013, right)

Criminal past: Mayweather (seen with Jackson in August 2012) has a history of domestic abuse with other exes

Breaking ground: Mayweather's fight is part of a $200million multi-fight deal and he was seen at a groundbreaking ceremony for MGM Resorts International on Thursday

Mayweather, who has a history of domestic abuse and was most recently released from jail in August 2012 after being found guilty of assaulting an ex-girlfriend, who is the mother of three of his children.

His domestic and social media disturbances are not the only reason he has been in the news this week as he suggested that 'a group of billionaires' join together the buy the LA Clippers in the wake of the Donald Sterling scandal.

He also has a fight against Marcos Maidana on Saturday, which will net Mayweather $32million.
