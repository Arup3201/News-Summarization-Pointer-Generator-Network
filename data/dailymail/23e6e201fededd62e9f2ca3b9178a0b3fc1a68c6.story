A 14-year-old Sacramento girl who was given only a one-percent chance of surviving a life-threatening condition is looking forward to a trip to Disneyland.

Paid for by the kindness of strangers donating to her gofundme page, Zoe Deibel suffers from a condition known as fetal hydrops, which causes fluid to collect on her lungs.

Delivered by emergency Cesarean section at 33-weeks old, doctors told Zoe's mother and father that her chances of living much longer were almost non-existent.

Bravery: Zoe Deibel has battled fetal hydrops since her birth. Doctors told her parents she had a one percent chance of survival at birth

Fighter: Zoe has always dreamed of traveling to Disneyland and has had to abort one attempt to get there in the past

Sick: Fetal hydrops affects Zoe's lungs and means she only has half the capacity of another 14-year-old girl

'Every year they said she wasn't going to make it. And every year she proved them wrong,' mom Christine Deibel told KTLA sister station KTXL on Saturday.

Since then, brave Zoe has been on life support multiple times and had six surgeries to repair his legs, which also suffer because of her illness.

Indeed, her condition has meant that she once got to Disneyland only to be forced to turn around because she was too sick.

Her lungs are so underdeveloped they only received about half the air she needs.

Mom, dad and Zoe: Doctors told the Deibel's that they should say good bye to their daughter shortly after she was born 14-years ago. She is still going strong now

Resolving to get Zoe to Disneyland and to also get her the portable oxygen concentrator tank she needs, the gofundme page is almost at its $10,000 target.

Zoe told KTXl what the oxygen tank would mean to her.

'Go to my friend's house randomly, just stay after school or be able to do recess or something more often,' she said.

The godfundme page tells Zoe's story and Jack Allen, the man who set it up, said his phone is going like crazy.

'From everywhere. My phone beeps all the time of 'you have another donation coming in,' Allen said.

Once she has visited Disneyland, Zoe told KTXl that she wants to be a chef someday.
