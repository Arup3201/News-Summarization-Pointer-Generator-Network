Prince Harry is today celebrating his 29th birthday, reportedly at a private event with close friends.

Harry, who was pictured at a the wedding of James Meade and Lady Laura Marsham in Norfolk, yesterday, is expected to mark the occasion with his girlfriend Cressida Bonas and close friend Guy Pelly, among a few others.

Then tomorrow, the Prince, who is a patron of the Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge, will resume his charitable duties, as he takes part in a 24-hour Cold Chamber Training Exercise with the British Team.

His Royal Highness will join the team inside MIRA's whole-vehicle environmental test chambers which simulate the extreme conditions they will face in the South Pole.

In the cold chamber, the team will practice their routine for the South Pole using cross trainers to simulate skiing. They will be skiing for two hours at a time before breaking for around 10 minutes and repeating this activity for 12 hours when they will set camp for the night

The past year has seen Harry hit the headlines on a number of occasions showing just how much the young Prince has matured in 12 months. 

Last Summer, he was famously snapped naked at a Las Vegas hotel with a mystery blonde.

The leaked pictures were taken on a riotous boys-only pre-deployment holiday to Vegas last summer, weeks before he flew out to Afghanistan.

Their publication provoked a debate over whether Harry violated his own privacy in showing such a lapse of judgment, and raised questions over the role of his taxpayer-funded Scotland Yard protection officers.

Under the patronage of Prince Harry, the Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge launched on 19th April 2013

In an interview earlier this year he spoke of his feelings about the decision by one tabloid newspaper to print the naked pictures.

He said: ‘Yes people might look at it going, “Yes it was letting off steam, it’s all understandable now, he was going off to Afghanistan”.

'Well, the papers knew that I was going out to Afghanistan anyway, so the way I was treated by them I don’t think is acceptable.’

Shortly after the pictures emerged the Apache pilot embarked on his second tour of Afghanistan, during which he later admitted he had killed Taliban insurgents, adding: 'Yeah, so lots of people have.'

Upon his return he threw himself into his charitable work with a visit to the southern African kingdom of Lesotho to see the work his charity Sentebale carries out.

On Friday Prince Harry told a delighted Nikki Christou had just seen Prince George smile for the first time

In May, he revealed the fruits of his hard work at the Chelsea Flower Show to unveil the Sentebale garden which paid tribute to his late mother.

The garden, which was co-designed by award winning landscape designer Jinny Blom, features Princess Diana's favourite hearts and crown motif on a stone worked terrace.

This year has also, of course, seen Harry become an uncle for the first time, and it seems he could not be happier after William and Kate welcomed baby George into the world.

The Prince proudly told crowds at an awards ceremony on Friday evening that he had just seen baby Prince George smile for the first time.

Speaking at the WellChild Awards, where he paid tribute to brave children battling serious illness, his face was said to have 'lit up' when he spoke about his seven-week old nephew, despite having just traveled  back from Norfolk with Prince William where they had attended the 
burial of their close family friend Hugh van Cutsem.

He was said to have 'beamed' when one nominee, Nikki Christou, nine, from Enfield, North London, told him that she shared the royal baby's July 22 birthday, her dad was called George, and her brother Alexander - one of the baby's middle names.

'Wow, very, very weird," Harry said. 'I've just literally seen him. Normally when I see him he's either sleeping or crying but I've just seen him smile. It was the first time I've seen him smile.'

It was also revealed this year that Harry has a steady girlfriend in socialite and actress Cressida Bonas.

Harry sparked rumours in August when he whisked Cressida off on a romantic African safari, just like his brother William did with Kate in 2010 when he asked her to marry him.

Sources claimed the Prince proved how serious he is about their relationship by taking her to Africa to show her the work he does with anti-landmine charity the HALO Trust in Angola.

It was a cause championed by his mother and is also one close to his heart. Diana visited minefields being cleared by the charity just before her death in 1997.

Their safari trip to Botswana also echoed the holiday Prince William and the future Duchess of Cambridge had in Kenya when he proposed to her in October 2010.
