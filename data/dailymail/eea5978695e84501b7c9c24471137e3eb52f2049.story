A student has almost died after being given an 'alcohol enema' at a college fraternity house.

Alexander Broughton, 20, was rushed to hospital unconscious after a rubber tube was inserted into his rectum and alcohol poured in.

The practice, known among students as 'butt chugging', took place during a party at  the Pi Kappa Alpha House on the grounds of the University of Tennessee.

Using the enema speeds up the process of alcohol entering the blood stream because it bypasses the liver's filters.

The 20-year-old was found to have a dangerously-high blood alcohol level of 'well over' 0.4.

Hospital staff treating the unconscious student at first thought he was the victim of a sexual assault when they examined his body.

They later discovered from his friends that he had been given the crude alcohol enema at the frat house in Knoxville.

Doctors at the UT Medical Center said the student had ingested so much alcohol he could have died from alcohol poisoning.

Investigators who later went to the frat house found three other students passed out in their rooms from drinking. They also found boxes of empty boxes of wine strewn around the Pi Kappa Alpha House.

University officials have now suspended the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity while police investigate the drinking party.

Broughton, who is from Memphis, was taken to hospital by a friend in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to a police report.

The student appeared to be 'extremely intoxicated and showed signs of physical and possible sexual assault'.

He was transferred to the hospital's critical care unit after his blood alcohol reading was put at 'well over' 0.4.

Broughton was discharged from the hospital on Monday. Police discovered that the 20-year-old and others at the frat house had been taking part in 'butt chugging'.

Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk said: 'Upon extensive questioning it is believed that members of the fraternity were using rubber tubing inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol as the abundance of capillaries and blood vessels present greatly heightens the level and speed of the alcohol entering the blood stream as it bypasses the filtering by the liver.'

A spokesman for the University of Tennessee said: 'University officials are currently conducting an investigation into allegations involving the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity chapter and incidents that occurred over the weekend.

'Due to the gravity of the allegations, interim sanctions have already been imposed upon the chapter and will remain in effect until the investigation is concluded and final reports are available.'

It is not the first time the PIKE chapter has been involved in trouble at the university.

In 2008, the chapter was placed on administrative suspension after a hazing incident where pledges were allegedly asked to do push-ups on broken glass.

Three students were later hospitalized with staph infections. A member of the fraternity said pledges were asked perform a 'lateral ab movement' known as 'bows and toes' on the bathroom floor.

The university's Office of Student Judicial Affairs charged the chapter with hazing and it pleaded guilty.

After completing its suspension, the chapter served several months of probation. The international PIKE organization investigated and kicked out 25 of the chapter's active members.
