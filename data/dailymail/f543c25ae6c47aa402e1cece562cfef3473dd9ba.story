A massive flood that carved canyons in Idaho 46,000 years ago could explain similar gorges on Mars.

Researchers claim the resemblance between ‘amphitheatre’ canyons in this region and those on Mars reveal important clues about the red planet’s watery past.

U-shaped amphitheatre canyons, such as those in Idaho’s Malad Gorge State Park, are relatively rare on Earth but common on the Martian surface.

A number of explanations for how these canyons formed have been offered with the most common being a slow and steady process of erosion from upwelling springs.

Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, California Institute of Technology professor, Michael Lamb, argues the canyons were created by an enormous flood rather than gradual erosion.

He has calculated that the brief flood was at least nine metres (30 feet) deep, flowing at a rate of around 1.25 million litres per second.

Two canyons in Malad Gorge, Woody's Cove and Stubby Canyon, are characterised by tall vertical headwalls, roughly 150 feet high that curve around to form an amphitheatre

The latest study builds on a body of research that has provided a clearer image of Mars' watery history.

Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived on Mars in 1971.

Mariner 9 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs.

Viking
 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on 
Mars by showing how floods of water broke through dams, carved deep 
valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of 
kilometers.

Mars is currently in the middle of
 an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present 
time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the 
past.

In June this year, Curiosity rover found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars.

Two canyons in Malad Gorge, Woody's Cove and Stubby Canyon, are characterised by tall vertical headwalls, roughly 150 feet high that curve around to form an amphitheatre.

To understand how they formed, the researchers conducted field surveys and collected rock samples from Woody's Cove, Stubby Canyon, and a third canyon in Malad Gorge, known as Pointed Canyon.

‘These blocks are too big to move by spring flow, and there's not enough time for the groundwater to have dissolved them away,’ Professor Lamb said ‘which means that large floods are needed to move them out.

‘To make a canyon, you have to erode the canyon headwall, and you also have to evacuate the material that collapses in.'

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered the amphitheatre-headed canyons of Malad Gorge formed at the same time as the amphitheatre-headed Box Canyon, about 18 km (11 miles) to the south 46,000 years ago.

A brief, powerful flood could have created these amphitheatre-headed canyons by exploiting fractures in the rock causing rapid erosion. 

These insights into ancient megafloods on Earth could reveal clues about what may have occurred on the surface of Mars millions of years ago

The amphitheatre-headed canyons originated around the same time as the volcanic eruption that led to the creation of the nearby McKinney Butte Basalt.

This suggests the megaflood that carved them was caused by lava flows diverting an ancient river.

These insights into ancient megafloods on Earth could reveal clues about what may have occurred on the surface of Mars millions of years ago.

The researchers are now developing models simulating canyon formation by megafloods.

‘We intend to test the model against our data at Malad Gorge and to apply it to specific examples on Mars,’ Professor Lamb told Live Science.

‘Using Earth as our guide, the early history of Mars surface environments, including the amounts and duration of flowing surface water, is waiting to be discovered through careful analysis of the landforms and sedimentary deposits on the red planet.’
