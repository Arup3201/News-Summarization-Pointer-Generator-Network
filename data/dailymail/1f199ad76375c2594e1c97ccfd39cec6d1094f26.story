Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has sold his luxurious waterside pad after three years on the market for $2.55 million - in the same 24 hours that he scored a century on the field.

The skipper’s Lilli Pilli property in Sydney's south sold to a young family from the eastern suburbs on Tuesday during day one of the Test between Australia and India.

The next day, the 33-year-old capped arguably the most remarkable Test match in his long and successful career by bringing up a hundred as the cricket world paid tribute to his 'little brother' the late Phillip Hughes.

The Australian cricket captain meanwhile sold his Lilli Pilli home in Sydney's south on Tuesday

Clarke defied painful back spasms to bat again - after a night of intense physiotherapy and painkilling injections - and joined Steve Smith at the crease when play resumed on day two at the Adelaide Oval.

The cricketer paid $2.87 million for his waterside residence in 2006 but reduced the asking price for the home to $2.4 million in November after it failed to sell.

He accepted thousands below what he originally purchased the house for after he and his model wife Kyly bought a luxurious $8.5 million mansion in Vaucluse in the eastern suburbs in March this year.

The house in south Sydney boasts picturesque views over the bay but spent a long time on the market

His celebration was subdued at first, kissing the helmet and hugging Smith before allowing himself a small smile

In the house he just sold, there is a  stunning 'Caesar Stone' gourmet island kitchen with walk-in pantry

The mansion offers a vast open plan main living area with high vaulted ceiling and picturesque water views

The Lilli Pilli property was up for sale by McGrath Real Estate.

The five bedroom, four bathroom pad on the banks of Gannon's Bay offers a vast open plan main living area with high vaulted ceiling and picturesque water views.

Sitting on a sizeable 1,667 square metre of block, the idyllic hideaway has been completed with modern finishings and features large windows that bath the interiors with natural light.

It boasts a swimming pool and jet spa, personal gym, a boat shed and a number of terraces, including majestic river views to the national park. 

A spacious kitchen complete with stone-top benches is elevated above a living and dining area

One of the four bathrooms - the ensuite-  features a double basin and large bath tub

The indoor space flows outside with french doors opening out onto a balcony that overlooks the bay

The multi-level home features ducted air conditioning, full security and integrated sound, with excellent access to the triple lock-up garage, which allows internal access to the house.

An immensely impressive family sanctuary offers high end finishes and stunning 'Caesar Stone' gourmet island kitchen with walk-in pantry.

In the past Clarke, used the home as somewhat of a retreat to escape from the publicity attracted by his relationship with bikini model Lara Bingle, before their split in 2010.

The luxury pad was the cricketer's first property investment and is one of a number that make up his burgeoning portfolio.

The middle order batsman also owns an apartment in Bondi valued at an estimated $6 million, and purchased a $3.5 million property in the Southern Highlands in 2012.

He and his wife Kyly, 32, moved into their Vaucluse mansion in June after temporarily living in the Bondi apartment the sportsman once shared with former fiance Lara.
