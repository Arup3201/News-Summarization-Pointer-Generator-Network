Research found that while standard-class carriages are packed with standing passengers, almost half of first-class seats remain empty

It's a sight guaranteed to infuriate commuters packed like sardines into overcrowded train carriages.

With standing room only in standard class, there are rows of empty first-class seats.

But this could soon change, following fresh calls to scrap first-class carriages after research indicated many of the premium areas remain half empty in rush hours.

Critics insist the comfort of commuters, who pay a high price to stand, should come before the train companies’ quest to maximise profits.

The research by a newspaper focused on trains arriving at London stations Paddington, Waterloo, Liverpool Street and King’s Cross between 8am and 9am on three consecutive weekdays.Trains typically had three first-class carriages and five in standard class.

Only about 50 per cent of first-class seats were occupied on these trains. 

Less than a fifth of the first-class carriages were full or nearly full and some had only three or four people in compartments with 48 seats. 

In almost all cases, passengers were standing in standard-class carriages, which seat 80 people each.

All but one of the train operators contacted refused to disclose their own figures on first class or failed to respond.

East Coast said its first-class carriages were, on average, 40 per cent full.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘It is sensible to think about the mix of first and standard-class carriages on our railways and it is something we are looking into.

'It is right to ask the question of whether it could deliver a better passenger experience.

'Equally, it is important to be absolutely clear that it is not a solution to the serious capacity issues we face.'

When setting the terms of the train firms’ contracts, the Transport Secretary and his department can specify detailed criteria which must be met if bidders for each new franchise are to be successful.

This could include adding more standard-class seats at the expense of first class.

Anthony Smith, of independent rail watchdog Passenger Focus, said: ‘A balance needs to be achieved between the number of standard and first-class carriages a train has.

‘It’s clear that where passengers are being squeezed into standard-class carriages while there are plenty of empty seats in first class, this balance is not being achieved.’ 

A spokesman for consumer watchdog London TravelWatch said: ‘Where there are overcrowded trains and still space in first class, operators should do what they have done in the past and be flexible and change the allocation.’ 

Government figures released in July showed one in five London-bound commuters have to stand during morning rush hours.

The service from Henley-on-Thames to the capital squeezes in nearly double the number of passengers it is designed to carry.
