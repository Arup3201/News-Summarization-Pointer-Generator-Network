It is a yearly occurrence in the Rhondda Valleys, South Wales, but these stunning images show the devastating impact that deliberately lit grass fires have on the local environment.

The fire, which took hold of a mountainside in the valleys yesterday, threatening properties between Penrhys and Tonypandy.

Eight hectares of trees and grassland were destroyed by the fire, with four fire engines from surrounding towns battling for two hours to calm the snake-like flames.

Yearly occurrence: The grass fires happen every Easter holiday period in South Wales, with nine out of ten of them being deliberately lit

The initial call at 3.26pm was one of
75 calls to the fire service about grass fires yesterday, with 265 
calls being made in the last week.

Each
year during the Easter holidays the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service
deal with hundreds of grass fires, nine out of ten of which they say 
are lit deliberately.

The fire service say that their resources are stretched to the limit every years as they attempt to deal with the fires.

Although it is difficult to 
determine, those involved in fighting the fires believe that it is local
youths who are off school who are responsible for the fires.

To help combat the problem the local fire service launched a campaign called Project Bernie.

It aims to explain the impact that fires in the area can have to local the local people, and the environment.

Project Bernie uses a combination of social marketing techniques in 
education and enforcement to address the issue of deliberate grass fires.

Group Manager Rob Morris, Head of Community Safety and Partnerships for 
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The people responsible for 
starting these types of fires need to understand that the fires severely
damage much of the countryside surrounding their communities and they 
are putting lives in danger as it can take us a few minutes longer to 
respond to incidents in the towns and villages of Caerphilly county 
borough if we are on top of a mountain tackling a forest fire.'

Project Bernie uses 'Bernie' the cartoon sheep as its logo, together with the strapline 'Grass is green, Fire is mean'.Â
