New EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker faced shock new claims about his drinking  last night.

A
 former Tory Foreign Office Minister who has worked with him closely 
said he drinks so heavily he ‘dribbles’ during meetings and is often 
‘incapable of working after lunchtime’.

And a newspaper in Mr Juncker’s native Luxembourg carried lurid details of a drinking binge he allegedly embarked upon.

The
 prominent British politician, who served as Minister for Europe, told 
The Mail on Sunday: ‘All the stories about Juncker’s drinking are true. I
 know because I had to work with him. He is a complete drunk.

‘I
 regarded it as pointless talking to him after 12 o’clock because at 
times he seemed incapable of working, so drunk you couldn’t get any 
sense out of him. It is every bit as bad as people say. I have seen him 
so p****d that he  was dribbling.

Mr Juncker is said to have drunk one Campari, three glasses of wine and three Sambucas in an hour

‘Everyone
 in Brussels knows that Juncker drinks far too much. I would call him an
 alcoholic. Talk to European politicians in private and they will all 
tell you about his drink problem.’

The
 politician, who spoke  to The Mail on Sunday on condition of anonymity,
 said Mr Juncker’s drinking was not the only reason he was unfit to be 
EC President.

‘He
 is totally wrong for the job and isn’t any good. I was talking to a 
senior French politician only the other day and he agreed with me that 
Juncker is useless.’

Mr Juncker, 59, has been dogged by rumours of a drink problem for years.

Summit
 tables were said  to have been awash with alcohol during his 20-year 
tenure as Prime Minister of Luxembourg. He resigned as a result of a spy
 scandal last year.

The newspaper Letzebuerg Privat (Luxembourg Private), has referred to him as the country’s ‘drunken stupor premier’.

Last
 year it ran a front-page report, accompanied by a photo of him guzzling
 drinks, in which it was alleged that he quaffed ‘a Campari, three 
glasses of wine and three Sambucas in only two hours’.

German journal Der Spiegel said: ‘Juncker no longer cares what others think about him.

‘When
 he has to take a leak during a summit meeting, he says with a smirk he 
goes to the ladies’ room, because the men’s room  is too dirty for him. 
His image fluctuates between two extremes, Mr Euro and Mr Idiot.’

Despite
 being a member of the EU’s Centre-Right political grouping, Juncker has
 been called ‘the most socialist Christian Democrat there is’. 

He
 has also been accused of arrogance and admits being deceitful when it 
suits his political purposes. ‘When it becomes serious you have to lie,’
 he said while handling the Eurozone crisis.

Another
 German publication, Junge Welt, called him ‘a ruthless opportunist’ who
 had done more for the EU’s bankers than for its people. ‘Juncker is not
 a Democrat in the strict sense. He is a master of the back stairs,’ it 
said.

Juncker’s own comments would appear to lend credibility to the claims. In 2011 he said: ‘Monetary policy is a serious issue.

‘We should discuss this in secret, in the Eurogroup. I am for secret, dark debates.’

He
 is a multi-millionaire through several bank and political jobs, has a 
£2m townhouse in Luxembourg city and a property in the country. He is 
married but does not have children.

He
 is not the first EU President from his country to have a reputation for
 drinking. Jacques Santerre, the Luxembourg-born Commission President 
from 1995-1999, was known as ‘Jacques Sancerre’ due to his supposed 
fondness for fine French wines.

Mr Juncker’s office refused  to comment.
