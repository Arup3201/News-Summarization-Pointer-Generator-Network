It seems that risking his life as he crosses the Chicago skyline 50 stories in the air isn't enough for daredevil Nik Wallenda, as the tightrope walker has revealed he will complete the feat blindfolded.

Wallenda broke the news this morning while appearing on Today,  shocking Matt Lauer when he made his big announcement.

'Why?' asked the morning show host.

Big announcement: Tightrope walker Nik Wallenda has revealed he will cross the Chicago River 50 stories in the air while blindfolded

Dizzying heights: Wallenda will begin at the Marina City West tower and walk a wire strung at an uphill 15-degree angle across the Chicago River to the Leo Burnett Building (seen above)

'It’s about challenging myself and through challenging myself, inspiring other people,' Wallenda told Lauer.

'I’ll not only need incredible physical strength to complete this walk, but laser-focued concentration,' he added.

The daredevil performer first revealed the plan for his latest feat in an interview with Outside, and it is not for the faint of heart.

He said he will begin at the Marina City West tower and walk a wire strung at an uphill 15-degree angle across the Chicago River to the Leo Burnett Building. 

And's that's not all.

Thrill of the chase: Wallenda is seen above crossing the Grand Canyon, over 1,000 feet in the air

Then he'll come down to ground level, walk back to Marina City West, and cross another wire to the Marina City East tower.

It is all set to go down on November 2, and, of course, will air as a live-TV special on Discovery.

This setting is shockingly urban for the tightrope walker, whose last two nerve-racking feats involved him crossing the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls.

The city also presents challenges that seem to make Wallenda a bit nervous.

'It’s gonna be cold. It’s gonna be windy,' he said.

'That’s the challenge. The other walks were enjoyable, peaceful.'

Seeing as those previous two 'peaceful' walks took place 1,400 feet in the air, it is safe to say the performer has a far different definition of the word than most.

Wallenda will be untethered for the walk, which he prefers.

He was tethered for the Niagara Falls walk, but was not for his performance in the Grand Canyon, meaning that any slip would be fatal.

Seven members of his family have fallen to their death, most recently Nik’s great-grandfather Karl during a 1978 walk in Puerto Rico.

That fear of possible death is what brings in the audiences however, says Wallenda.

'The public is fascinated with a guy on TV that could die at any second.'

He quickly added, 'Now, do they wanna see me die? I don’t think so.'
