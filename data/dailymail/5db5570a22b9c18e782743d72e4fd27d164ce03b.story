Arsenal are close to signing Argentine wonderkid Maxi Romero - who has been dubbed the next Lionel Messi.

The Gunners are in advanced talks with Velez Sarsfield over a £4.5million swoop for the teenage sensation.

Arsenal are confident of completing a deal for the 16-year-old in the coming days.

'Arsenal have made a big offer for Maxi Romero. I don't want to talk figures just yet but it's a big offer,' confirmed Velez president Raul Gamez.

Romero's agent Rolando Zarate said: 'I met with Arsene Wenger twice in London. They heard about Maxi through their scouts in South America. He is the player who has most impressed him.

'Maxi has huge potential but he is going to complete apprenticeship at a great club like Velez.' 

The Argentine wonderkid has been dubbed the next Lionel Messi and would stay at Velez on loan

Romero is expected to remain with Velez, on loan, for at least two more seasons before coming to England to begin his career with Arsenal.

The youngster is yet to make his senior debut for Velez but has trained regularly with the first team.

Arsenal are always on the lookout for young talent to join their ranks.

In January they signed defensive midfielder Krystian Bielik from Polish club Legia Warsaw.
