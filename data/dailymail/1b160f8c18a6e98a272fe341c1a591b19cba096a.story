A controversial New York Jets player is being sued for child support for the second time in two years after fathering another love child with a different woman.

Fashion blogger Ashton Whittington is taking wide receiver Braylon Edwards, 29, to family court in Manhattan after she gave birth to their son last year, the New York Post reported.

Model Nik Pace successfully sued Edwards in 2010 after she also had a child by the player.

Ashton Whittington, the latest claimant against Edwards, gave birth to a baby fathered by the NFL star that very same year.

The boy, called Ashton Arthur Whittington, is now 18 months old, according to the Post. 

'Braylon and Ashton had a relationship, and around the time he was arrested in September 2010 [for DWI], she became pregnant,' a source said.

'They are no longer together. He knows about his son and is paying interim child support, but Ashton is suing for a more formal child support agreement.'

Edwards’ lawyer told the Post that his client is 'honoring his financial obligations, and there is an agreed 
[temporary] order in place.'

But Whittington has hired Lauren Mallin, the same top attorney who had previous success against Edwards in a similar case. 

In 2010 Mallin represented Nik Pace, a finalist on America’s Next Top Model in 2005. Pace also sued Edwards for child support.

His legal team tried to hold the case in Georgia, an act described by Pace's lawyers as a 'cold, calculated act to pay less money' as that state generally awards less in child support payments.

But the litigation was held in New York and Pace won the case, though it was reported that she was awarded less than her $70,000-a-month demand.

Edwards has settled down with new girlfriend, Victoria Bow. On Bow's birthday in March he tweeted a series of messages of undying love to her.

'I've never felt like this. I don't deserve her. Victoria I will never let you down. You are my world and it's official,' he said.

Edwards acknowledged his bad-boy history in another tweet: 'It's not about a past or a perception it's about the live she gives to me and I give to her.'

The NFL player has regularly made negative headlines. He has been in trouble with police for speeding violations, drink-driving incidents and allegedly punching a friend of NBA star LeBron James outside a nightclub.

Edwards recently rejoined the New York Jets after leaving the team in August 2011. He was resigned by the club last week, despite calling the Jets' management 'idiots' on Twitter at the start of December. 

He is expected to make his debut against the Tennessee Titans tonight.
