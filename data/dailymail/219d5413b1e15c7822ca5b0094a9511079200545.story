Google has
denied it ever deleted - and then reinstated - a MailOnline story about a
notorious child killer under the controversial ‘right to be forgotten’ European
Court ruling.

The search
giant had informed MailOnline earlier this month that a story about killer
Ronald Castree, which appeared on the website in November 2007, had been
removed from European search results.

The father
of Castree's 11-year-old victim Lesley Molseed had described the removal of the
article as 'appalling'.

Father
Fred Anderson said: 'He hasn’t got the right to be forgotten - it’s terrible.

'He’s
locked up in prison for life and he keeps coming up with things. We’ll never
get peace, this has been going on for 40 years.'

Killer: The story Google has denied ever deleting relates to the 2007 conviction of paedophile Ronald Castree, 61, (left), for the murder of Lesley Molseed, 11 (right) in 1975

Lesley's father Fred Anderson (pictured) said: 'He hasn’t got the right to be forgotten - it’s terrible'

The ruling by European judges gives 
people the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about 
them wiped from the web, which led to the search engine being bombarded 
with requests.

The article about the conviction of Castree, 61, is just one of thousands Google has removed from search results and just one of numerous MailOnline articles affected by the ruling.

A story about a millionaire banker blamed for helping cause the global financial crisis was among the first to be hidden as was an airline accused of racism by a Muslim job applicant.

However, a spokesman from Google early Saturday said that while the article HAD been removed from some search results it was NOT at the request of Ronald Castree.

And he said the request had been granted to someone else mentioned in the article but that the story would still appear if Castree was used at the search term.

Under the right to be forgotten rule, stories are not entirely deleted by Google, rather they simply will no longer appear if a certain search name is used.

The spokesman refused to say who had asked for the article to be removed and thus granted the right to be forgotten.

The body of Lesley Molseed being removed from the windswept moor where Castree left it in October 1975

Castree, a book dealer and married father of one, snatched Lesley off the street near her home in Rochdale as she went to buy bread for her mother in October 1975.

He had been on the way to visit his wife and her new baby in hospital.

Castree killed Lesley in a frenzied attack, stabbing her 12 times, once through the heart, before leaving her body on a lonely moor in West Yorkshire.

He then kept quiet when an innocent man, Stefan Kiszko, was tried, convicted, sentenced and served 16 years for a crime he did not commit.

The real killer was only captured in 2006 when a DNA sample Castree had given in relation to an attack on a prostitute in 2005 was found to be an exact match for sperm found on Lesley's underwear.

In 2007, he was found guilty of murder at Bradford Crown Court and told he would not be considered for parole until 2037, by which time he will be 84.

He attempted to appeal his conviction in 2008, but was rejected.

Jim Killock, Executive Director of Open Rights Group, said: 'It is deeply problematic that a private company can make decisions about things that get censored, as they will end up making mistakes.'

The BBC's economics editor, Robert Peston, was affected by the ruling when he had a 2007 blogpost about the former Merrill Lynch boss Stan O'Neal excluded from some search results.

He said today of the MailOnline's story: 'It does not seem to be in the public interest for the "right to be forgotten" to be applied to stories such as this one.'

Paedophile convicted of Lesley Molseed murder - after evading justice for 32 years

Original article that was published by MailOnline on 16 November 2007.

Lesley Molseed was abducted and stabbed to death by Ronald Castree in October 1975

Ronald Castree, 54, will serve a minimum of 30 years for what the judge called 'a truly dreadful crime', adding that he accepted the killer would probably die in jail.

Lesley Molseed, from Rochdale, was abducted and killed in 1975, in a case which resulted in one of Britain's most notorious miscarriages of justice.

Her body was found on Rishworth Moor in West Yorkshire and Stefan Kiszko, a lonely misfit, confessed to the crime under duress.

He was jailed and served 16 years before he was cleared in 1991 when it emerged that sperm samples taken from her clothes could not have been his, as he was infertile. He died the following year.

Forensic scientists used new techniques to produce a DNA profile in 2000. And last year they found that Castree, who had given a sample after being arrested in 2005 on another matter, was a one-in-a-billion match.

Court records also showed that days before Mr Kiszko stood trial, Castree had abducted a nine-year-old and subjected her to an indecent assault which led to a conviction.

At the murder trial, Castree tried to have this conviction kept from the jury. He also argued that the sample from Lesley's clothes must have innocently become contaminated with his DNA.

But the jury at Bradford Crown Court was not taken in. Mr Justice Openshaw told Castree, a trader in comic books: 'You kept quiet whilst an entirely innocent man was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced for this murder.'

Lesley's mother April Garrett, left, said justice had been done when Castree was convicted of her daughter's murder - not before innocent man Stefan Kiszko, right, spent 16 years in jail for a crime he did not commit

Afterwards Lesley's mother, who has reverted to her maiden name, April Garrett, said: 'We are relieved that after so long our quest for justice for Lesley is now over.'

He appeared to all the world as a caring father - and a hard-working, self-made man. But for 32 years, Ron Castree lived with a terrible secret.

Behind his respectable facade, he was a paedophile and serial sex attacker who eventually progressed to child murder.

While his wife and her baby were in hospital in 1975, Castree snatched Lesley Molseed off a street in Rochdale as she went to buy bread for her mother.

He drove the 11-year-old, who had learning difficulties, to a windswept moor, sexually assaulted her and stabbed her to death in a 'frenzied' attack.

The EU's ‘right to be forgotten’ legislation allows European citizens to request that links to ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant’ information be removed from Google search results.

In short, Google must remove articles if the impact on the individual’s privacy is greater than the public’s right to find it, the European Union Court of Justice found.

The landmark case that led to the new legislation was brought by a Spanish man who complained that an auction notice of his repossessed home on Google's search results infringed his privacy.

Since the legislation was introduced in May, Google has said it has received more than 120,000 requests from across Europe ranging from serious criminal records, embarrassing photos and negative press stories.

An online form was launched to allow EU citizens to ask for personal data to be taken down.

The form requires links to the material the person wants removed, their country of origin, and a reason for their request. Individuals also have to attach a valid photo identity.

Google then assesses each request individually, before deciding whether to remove information from search results.

Since May, MailOnline has had several articles taken down.

Among the most high profile articles removed was one from May 2009 describing the captivity in which Josef Fritzl kept his family.

It has also included a September 2010 article about multi-millionaire Tory MP Jonathan Djanogly, who admitted hiring private eyes to spy on his local party members.

A December 2003 column on how the schoolfriend of Prince William, Edward Stanbury, was jailed for nine months after 43 ecstasy tablets, 4.2 grammes of cocaine and three-quarters of a kilo of cannabis were found at his London flat.

A March 2004 column by Richard Kay, also on Mr Stanbury, about how just weeks after he had been allowed home from prison, the Old Etonian had put his university studies aside and sold his flat.

A July 2007 story about teenager Kyle Ivison who was given an ASBO for committing 40 per cent of the offences in Clitheroe, Lancashire.

An article from 2008 about drunken University of Bristol student Alex Fiallos, who drove his Mini Cooper round the university campus like a scene from the Italian Job.

An article from February 2011 about Muslim airport worker Salim Zakhrouf who accused airline Cathay Pacific of racism after he was refused a job interview – only to be offered one when he applied two days later using a fake white British-sounding name.

A story about Scottish referee Dougie McDonald, who admitted lying to Celtic manager Neil Lennon about the awarding of a penalty in 2010
