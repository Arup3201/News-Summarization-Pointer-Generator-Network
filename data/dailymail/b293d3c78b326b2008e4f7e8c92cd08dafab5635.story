Five people have been killed after a plane carrying a group of skydivers crashed and burst into flames as family members of those aboard watched in horror.

Witnesses said the Cessna 206 disintegrated in a fireball after coming down shortly after taking off from the Caboolture airfield, north of Brisbane, Australia, about 11.30am on Saturday.

Police said there were five people on board and no survivors. A couple from New Zealand who leave behind six children are believed to have been on board.

Rahuia (Rahi) Hohua died alongside fiance Joseph King and three others when the plane crashed.

Hohua,
from Hamilton, and King - from Auckland - lived in Logan, Queensland, 
and had six children between them. Hohua was a mother of two and King a 
father of four.

Police have
yet to release the names of the dead, but the three others on the plane
were understood to be skydiving instructors Glenn Norman and Juraj 
Glesk and the pilot.

A police spokesman said it was believed some of the families of those killed were at the airfield to watch the skydive.

It's understood two skydiving companies operate from Caboolture airfield, which has been shut down by police.

Two
investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau were 
travelling to Caboolture from Brisbane and three more were due to arrive
from Canberra later on Saturday.

A bureau spokesman said they would examine the wreckage, interview witnesses and study the weather to find out what went wrong.

Airport safety officer Bryan Carpenter said he saw the crash, adding that the plane, which was loaded with high-octane fuel, was destroyed by flames within a minute of impact.

He said the plane veered to the left after take-off before plunging to the ground and catching fire.

It took firefighters 10 minutes to douse the inferno, with another witness saying the fire was out of control when he arrived on the scene.

'It was hard getting close. You can't put that type of fire out with hand-held extinguishers,' Mark Thompson from the Caboolture Warplane Museum said.

Both Carpenter and Thompson said it was the worst crash they'd seen at the airport.

'They've had a couple of incidents here but nothing like this,' according to Thompson, who ran about 200 metres to the scene after hearing a loud thud and seeing a plume of smoke.

Carpenter, who has worked at Caboolture for 14 years, said the crash could have been caused by any number of things.

'One of the things one would expect would be an engine failure, but the engine was delivering power on touch down," he said.

'So it's something mechanical I would say ... or the pilot could have blacked out â€“ any number of scenarios; it's a bit like MH370 at the moment, we just don't know.'

Meanwhile,
air crash investigators failed to find out three years ago why a plane 
associated with the company involved in Saturday's accident conducted a 
forced landing on a gravel road, leaving two skydivers severely injured.
