The Washington Redskins helped round out a humiliating year with a stomping from the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday that left stands nearly empty by halftime.

Blizzardy conditions drove fans away last night in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but the faint dusting of snow at FedEx Field left the Skins with no excuse.

And most all the footprints in what little snow did fall were on Robert Griffin III's side of the field, proving yet again the once-promising quarterback's team has lost its mojo.

Barely snowed: Fans all but abandoned the Washington's FedEx Field on Sunday after the home team's brutal first half against the Kansas City Chiefs

It was the fifth straight loss for the Redskins, and it was enough to make even the toughest players lose faith.

'It's a terrible game to be a part of,' Redskins linebacker Brian Orakpo said.

Griffin, too, was forced to be honest with himself and whatever Redskins fans who remain after the devastating season.

'None of us played good today,' Griffin said. 'I didn't play well. We all have to play better. I have to play better.'

Nothing to play for: Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III walks off the field after the humiliating game, which his team lost 45-10. Griffin, who was the 2011 Heisman winner and number 2 draft pick of 2012, was replaced by backup Kirk Cousins in what became the team's fifth straight loss

'None of us played good today,' Griffin admitted. 'I didn't play well. We all have to play better. I have to play better.'

The Chiefs were already trouncing the Redskins 38-10 at halftime, when the stands all but cleared out despite the weather being far better than it was in snowy Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Sunday.

In fact, fans deserted what was Washington's first snowy home game in decades, and those that stayed had plenty to boo. The Chiefs took the opening kickoff and gained 8, 9, 22 and 13 yards on their first four plays.

The Redskins were a team with nothing to play for, and they looked like it. Shanahan eventually pulled the plug on Griffin, inserting Cousins for the final quarter.

Meanwhile, everywhere else: Fans in Baltimore stuck to their seats despite far snowier conditions than in nearby Washington, DC during this game against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday

Far snowier: Eagles fans in Philly seemed to stick around, too, as major snow crept up the East Coast on Sunday while they hosted the Detroit Lions

Pittsburgh: The Steelers game against the Miami Dolphins in Pittsburgh also got more snow, and stirred more excitement, than the Redskins trouncing

It was perhaps the least interesting among all the East Coast games affected as the powerful, wintry storm that chilled much of North America through the previous week.

Griffin, the 2011 Heisman trophy winner, has had a terrible year following his horrifying fall during January's losing game to the Seattle Seahawks, which knocked the Redskins out fo playoff contention.

Since the injury, the final among several that unltimately left RGIII with two torn knee ligaments, the number 2 draft pick of 2012 has only fallen further.

Bad year: RGIII has seen nothing but drama since this cringe-inducing fall in January ended what could have been a triumphant 2012 season for Griffin

Marital woes? What could have been a good day, the day RGIII was married in July, ended up being terrible for the quarterback after a Hooters waitress exposes purported proof he sent her racy messages on his wedding day

Speculation swirled immediately following his cringe-inducing fall around Coach Mike Shanahan's decision to play the already visibly weakened RBIII him in the first place.

Even the day of his nuptials to Rebecca Liddicoat in July only remained a happy one briefly.

Rumors soon spread online, along with purported visual proof, that RGIII had been sending racy messages to a Virginia Hooters waitress on the very day of his wedding.

Griffin has also enured weeks of 
questions about his relationship with Shanahan, who is rumored to take 
issue with Griffin's relationship with the team owner Dan Snyder.

Shanahan appears the odd man out in the triangle of coach, owner and franchise player.

While
Shanahan has failed to even deny rumors he planned to quit last season,
the Washington Post reports that Griffin was recently overcome with 
emotion as he discussed the off-the-field speculation and chatter.

'I’m
getting frustrated now, and trying to hold everything back,' Griffin 
said as his eyes watered. 'Some things are allowed to happen, and we can
cut a lot of this stuff out, and it is not being cut out. I don’t know 
what else I can do about that.'

Deepening rifts? Griffin (right) has also been forced to fend off continued rumors about his embattled relationship with head coach Mike Shanahan (left, leaving after Sunday's losing game)
