Life-saving operation: Jade Lucas, 20, almost died when fluid began spurting out of her head during an emergency operation

Jade Lucas, 20, almost died when a huge cyst in her brain filled with fluid - and burst when surgeons drilled open her skull to operate.

The fluid began to pour from Jade's brain during the operation, but doctors carried on with the surgery and saved her life.

Jade has had an arachnoid cyst and excess fluid in her brain since she was born.

She has undergone brain surgery 15 
times at Great Ormond Street Hospital - but has now been told by doctors
she is unlikely to need any more major surgery for years.

The
college student, from Horley, Surrey, said: 'I couldn't believe it when
I was told what had happened during my surgery - I don't think the 
doctors had ever had to dodge brain fluid during an operation before.

'I'm
told I was lucky to survive after such high pressure in my brain. I 
can't thank the doctors and nurses who saved my life enough.'

Despite
making a full recovery, Jade still relies on a shunt inserted into her 
brain to keep her alive - which drains fluid directly into her heart - 
to prevent it collecting in her skull.

Her condition is so severe that doctors spotted a dark mass on her brain before she was even born - on an ultrasound scan.

Just months after she was born, Jade's mum noticed one side of her head growing faster than the other - and a brain scan revealed she was suffering from an arachnoid cyst.

The cyst was already too big to remove, and surgeons inserted the shunt into Jade's brain to drain the fluid.

Jade said: 'I've known about my condition all my life, so I've been used to going in and out of hospital for operations.

'I went for a routine check up the day before I started college, and doctors noticed a lot of pressure behind my eye - and discovered my optic nerve had been bleeding.

Jade is still suffering, she said: 'One day I'll feel perfectly normal, but the next I might not be able to get out of bed due to blinding headaches'

'I'd already had a shunt implanted in 
my head as a child that was supposed to drain fluid away - but it had 
somehow broken, and fluid was building up fast.

'They told me I needed an emergency operation for surgeons to release the pressure, as the cyst was growing bigger and bigger.

'If it got any bigger, it could have caused brain damage.

'If my shunt stops draining, I have four hours to get treated before things get very dangerous.

'I've since found out there was so much fluid under pressure in my head it had literally exploded when surgeons opened up my skull.

Recovery process: Jade has undergone brain surgery 15 times at Great Ormond Street Hospital, but still manages to stay upbeat

A shunt is a delicate piece of equipment that's prone to malfunction, usually through blockage or infection.

It's estimated that up to 4 out of 10 shunts will malfunction in the first year after surgery.

Sometimes a scan carried out after the operation shows that the shunt isn't in the best position, and that further surgery may be needed to reposition it.If a baby or child has a shunt fitted, the shunt may become too small as your child grows, and it will need to be replaced. As most people need to have a shunt for the rest of their life, more than one replacement may be needed.It's estimated that most children with hydrocephalus may have an average of two procedures for shunt problems before they're 10 years old.A shunt blockage can be very serious because it can lead to an excess build-up of fluid on the brain, which can cause brain damage.Â 

Shunt infection is also a relatively common complication. The risk of infection can be around 3-15% and is more likely to occur during the first few months after surgery.

'When I'd recovered, a nurse told me 
the minute the surgeon had drilled into my skull, the fluid came 
spurting out - and he had to jump out of the way.'

Jade slipped into a coma following the operation, and doctors told her terrified mum she might not survive.

Over the next week, she had four further operations on her brain, but amazingly, managed to pull through.

Surgeons were eventually able to fit another brain shunt. And after a further 15 months of operations and hospital appointments, she was finally able to start a college course.

Jade said: 'I try to just get on with things, but the condition does affect my day-to-day life quite a lot.

'One day I'll feel perfectly normal, but the next I might not be able to get out of bed due to blinding headaches and pressure behind my eyes making it painful to see anything bright - even daylight.

'Sometimes I wake up with a headache and feel well enough to go to college, but within a few hours I have such a crippling pain in my head it feels like it is going to burst.

'However, my new shunt has now been problem-free for two years, which is a good sign, as 50 per cent of shunts fail within 24 months.

'I hope now I'll be one of the lucky ones - and my shunt could last me a good 25 years before I'll need another operation.'
