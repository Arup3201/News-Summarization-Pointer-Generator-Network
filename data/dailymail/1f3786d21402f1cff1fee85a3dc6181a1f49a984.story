A British mother was accused of abducting her two daughters after U.S. immigration officials refused to believe the family were related... because they have different surnames.

Katie Percival, 13, was travelling with her mother Victoria Turner, who is divorced and uses a different surname.

When they landed at  New York's JFK Airport, Ms Turner presented her divorce papers, birth certificates for Katie and her sister, her previous passport with the surname Percival and her proof of marriage.

Victoria Turner, right, was accused by U.S. border officials of abducting her daughters Katie, pictured, and Ella Percival because she had a different surname to the children

But officials demanded a letter from the girls' father giving permission for them to be taken abroad, and even threatened to send them back before finally relenting.

Katie, of Bromley in Kent, has now launched an online petition urging the Home Office to put the names of both parents (where known) on the passports of under 18s.

Her mother, Ms Turner, is Katie’s main carer after she and Katie’s father divorced 11 years ago. But because of the divorce she has a different surname to Katie.

When the pair, who were travelling with Katie's younger sister 12-year-old Ella, where stopped in June the border officials refused to believe the trio were related.

Katie, 13, has launched an online petition calling on the Home Office to change the rules and include the names of both parents on a child's passport

Katie said: 'I was at JFK airport in the USA with my family. The immigration officer looked at my mum’s passport, then my sister’s.

'He looked up and said: "You have different surnames, where’s the father?"

'My mum said that he was in England. He then asked for proof that my mum wasn’t abducting us.

'I was shocked. My mum showed him her divorce papers, our birth certificates, her previous passport with our surname and her proof of marriage.

'He wasn’t interested and said that if we were entering the USA we would need a written letter from our dad giving permission for my mum to take us abroad.

'He even threatened to send us home. I was staggered. We were eventually allowed through, but it marred the start of our holiday and is something I will not forget.'

Katie came up the idea for a petition in late October when she was attending an event run by Girlguiding UK and change.org.

The event was to mark the launch of Go For It - Be The Change, an activity pack written by young members of Girlguiding struck by the lack of female representation in government.

Katie added: 'The event was showing us how to make change for women.

'They were showing us how we could make petitions for women’s rights.

'When I got home I told mum my idea.

'I remember in America it had been really scary, the immigration officer kept looking at us and questioning if we were mum’s daughters.

'I really think that this should happen. It is a really big issue if you think about it.'

Katie Percival has urged the Home Office to alter the rules and add the names of both parents, where known, to the passports of under 18s.

Her petition entitled Put The Names Of BOTH Parents On The Passports Of Under 18s, to the Home Office, states: 'They
now say that 50 per cent of marriages end in divorce, and the number keeps 
rising. So what happens to the children? They tend to take their 
father’s last name, regardless of which parent they live with.

'The
majority of children with divorced parents live with the mother, for a 
variety of reasons.

'HOWEVER, if the mother wants to take the children 
abroad for a holiday, she has to seek written permission from the father
to be allowed permission.

'What
happens if the mother doesn’t have any contact with the father or he 
refuses to give permission? Why should the main carer of the child have 
to seek written permission from a secondary carer to take their child on
holiday?

'My parents are 
divorced and we have this problem 90% of the time. So I have started 
this petition to raise awareness of this issue. There needs to be a 
sense of equality in this aspect of parenting.

'Having
the names of both parents (where known) on passports of under 18s would
alleviate this problem and save a great deal of stress for many 
families.

'I may not have 
chosen one of the world’s "big issues" but it’s one that matters to me 
and a lot of other children and young people today.'
