We’ve all been there: you’re out on the town, it’s 1am, you’ve lost your friends and your contemptible mobile phone battery dies just when you need it most.

But a new handbag-turned-phone-charger is hoping to put an end to battery woes and become a woman’s ultimate night out ally.

The Mighty Purse describes itself as a ‘glamorous solution to this seemingly hopeless conundrum’ and promises users that they can charge their phone on the go without compromising on style.

Girly gadget: The £84.99 Mighty Purse, a leather tote with an in-built charger, hopes to be a woman's night out ally

Made from real leather and available in three different finishes, the purse contains a built-in high-capacity battery that claims to recharge your poor energy-sapped phone up to 2 times per charge.

The purse, which is compatible with all Micro USB smartphones and iPhones, can be charged up ahead of your night out via your computer.

The gadget, which is being sold at Firebox.com, also has an internal 4-LED indicator so you'll always know how much juice the charger has left.

The purse has room for all the usual girly essentials such as cards, keys and make-up but Facebook status updates, Instagram snaps and late night calls come at a price – the Mighty Purse will set you back £84.99.

Ben Redhead, buyer at Firebox.com, said: 'The flat smartphone battery is one of the 21st century's most common afflictions and more often than not, your most prized possession will run out of juice when you need it most.

'The Mighty Purse aims to bring a glamourous end to the dreaded dead phone battery, leaving you to enjoy your day or night out safe in the knowledge that not only is your phone fully charged, you look damn good whilst charging it.

'Your smartphone will work long into the night, so you can still send those incoherent text messages, snapchat your friend’s silly antics, or make those 3am Saturday night phone calls to your heart’s desire.’
