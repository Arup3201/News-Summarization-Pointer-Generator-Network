Friends and family of a Georgia teenager abducted in the night yesterday are scrambling to gather a ransom now being demanded by her kidnappers.

The two strangers who wrenched Ayvani Hope Perez from her suburban Atlanta home want $10,000 for the 14-year-old’s safe return.

The men are making the rare ransom demand despite taking Perez only after the family had no money or jewelry to give Tuesday.

'She's safe!': Home invaders stole Ayvani Hope Perez, 14, away from her family Tuesday. The teen was returned to her family safe and sound Wednesday

A vigil of 150 people gathered late Tuesday evening, but Perez’s aunt Suky Guerrero told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution she was still unsure where the money was going to come from.

‘My brother doesn’t have a clue. He doesn’t have any money like that,’ Geurrero, the sister of the girl’s father, told the Journal-Constitution.

A law enforcement source confirmed the ransom demand to the Atlanta paper. Meanwhile, local officials have publicly denied knowledge of a ransom.

'We haven't heard anything about a ransom, I don't know how that got out,' Clayton County police Sergeant Kevin Hughes told Mailonline.

Sergeant Hughes said the county is now working in conjunction with state and federal officials. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesperson said the FBI has now taken the lead on the case.

A call to FBI's Atlanta division was not immediately returned Wednesday morning.

Terrified: The 4-foot-9, Hispanic teen was wrenched from her terrifying mother around 2am Tuesday while she was still wearing her Star Wars pajamas. Police say she is in extreme danger

‘He was devastated, not knowing what to do,’ Guerrero said of her brother.

Alberto Perez, 47, was en route to Atlanta as his daughter’s terrified friends gathered at Dutchtown High School in Hampton, Georgia for a prayer vigil.

‘She's so nice,’ one friend told 11alive.com. ‘I don't know why people would do this to her. I'm praying just to get her home safely.’

Another classmate was struggling to come to grips with the situation.

‘I don't get it,’ said Sydney Chaquir. ‘It's not clicking in my mind why somebody would do this to her. It's like a dream.’

Senseless: Two black males in dark clothing broke into Perez's Ellenwood, Georgia home at 2am Tuesday. When her mother had no valuables, they shot the dog and took Ayvani

Clayton County Georgia police spokesman Phong Nguyen said the invasion appears to be completely random.

‘It didn’t appear that they knew each other,’ he said. ‘They just moved in about a month ago.’

Nguyen said the two African American males smashed through a back door of the home and Maria Perez quickly tried to hide her children, but the men found Ayvani.

The men wanted money and jewelry, but Maria had none to give, so they took the girl instead.

Relief: Around 150 of Ayvani's classmates and former classmates gathered at a Hampton, Georgia high school for a Tuesday night prayer vigil. Their prayers were answered Wednesday

Spreading the word: Many friends and even concerned strangers quickly took to social media to spread word of Ayvani's kidnapping and to gather information

Alert: Clayton County police monitor Brookgate Drive, a suburban street full of families where Ayvani had lived for just one month before she was snatched

Now authorities are doing what they can to get her back.

‘This is the time for the Clayton community and the community as a whole to come together,’ Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter said. ‘We’re trying to make sure that we bring her some safely.’

The abductors escaped with Perez in a grey Dodge or Chevrolet sedan and were described as wearing dark clothing.

Perez is believed to be in extreme danger and a Levi's Call—Georgia's version of the Amber alert—was activated.

erez is Hispanic,  4-foot-9, 93 pounds, and has brown eyes and brown hair.

She was last seen wearing blue and grey Star Wars pajamas and a superhero sweatshirt.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation released sketches of the two men who kidnapped Perez from the 3800 block of Brookgate Drive.

Clayton County police urge anyone who may have information to call (678) 610-4781 immediately.

The search: Investigators quickly fanned out across Georgia with police checkpoints and helicopters searching for Ayvani on Tuesday
