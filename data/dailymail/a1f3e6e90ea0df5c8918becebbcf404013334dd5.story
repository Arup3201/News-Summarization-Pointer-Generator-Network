Covered in blood and with a haunted look of fear in their eyes, the people of Douma are shell-shocked following deadly air strikes that decimated the city.

At least 66 people were killed on Thursday as Syria's regime pounded the rebel stronghold with air strikes after a barrage of opposition fire hit the capital Damascus.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 12 children were among those killed in Douma, which is in the opposition-held Eastern Ghouta region just outside Damascus.

More than 60 air strikes battered the city, with locals running for their lives as the bombardment continued.

Photographer Abd Doumany, who took the pictures, said the assault caused chaos and said: 'This is the worst day in Douma in four years.'

He added: 'The situation in the hospitals is very bad. There are shortages of everything.'

He said medics had been wounded in the shelling and terrified residents were forced to hide out in their basements.

Local field hospitals were overwhelmed by arrivals, some of whom lay on the floor to receive treatment.

Douma, in Eastern Ghouta, is a key rebel bastion on the outskirts of Damascus and has been under siege for nearly two years.

Since mid-2012, the government has carried out frequent air raids on rebel-held areas. It is accused by human rights groups of indiscriminately killing both civilians and insurgents.

But an anonymous military official warned: 'If the terrorists think that by shelling Damascus they will ease the pressure on them, they are making a big mistake.

'We will continue to hunt them down and destroy them.'

Zahran Alloush, the leader of rebel group Jaysh al-Islam (Army of Islam), said they would continue to attack government positions in downtown Damascus.

During the attack on Damascus, a barrage of at least 120 rockets and mortar rounds fired by rebel forces killed 10 people, among them a child.

The assault left usually busy streets of the city deserted and prompted Damascus University to close for the day, sending students home.

Devastated: More than 200,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, which began with anti-government protests in March 2011 and escalated into a civil war

Elsewhere in the country, the Observatory reported that at least 16 members of the Islamic State jihadist group were killed in strikes by the US-led coalition fighting the group.

The strikes in northeastern Hasakeh province hit a building containing a weapons and explosives depot, where secondary explosions were reported.

More than 200,000 people have now died in the Syrian conflict, which began with anti-government protests in March 2011 and escalated into a civil war.
