With a display of almost extravagant reverence, here is Autumn Phillips curtseying deeply for the Queen at the Royal Windsor Horse Show yesterday.

Watched by her husband Peter, Princess Anne’s Canadian daughter-in-law followed protocol to the letter as Her Majesty approached in her Range Rover.

The Royals are known to take the rules surrounding curtseying very seriously.

Respectful: Autumn curtseying for The Queen as she drove into the Royal Windsor Horse Show

Family outing: Peter Phillips, the son of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, rides the carousel with his wife Autumn and their daughters Isla and Savannah at the Royal Windsor Horse Show

All smiles: Peter Phillips, wife Autumn and their daughters Isla Phillips & Savannah Phillips enjoy the rides

They are set down in the Order of Precedence.

This dictates which members of the family should curtsey to whom.

Montreal-born Autumn, 36, who has retained her Canadian citizenship since settling in London after marrying the Queen’s grandson in 2008, was later seen looking more relaxed as she and her husband and their daughters, Savannah, three, and two-year-old Isla, hopped aboard a merry-go-round for a ride.

Prince Philip, 92, also attended the event.

He looked in good shape after his recent health problems as he extracted a fold-up chair from the back of his car and set it up without assistance before settling down to a packed lunch.

An onlooker said: ‘He stayed for nearly five hours, sitting next to two other judges. He seemed  remarkably content.

‘Every so often during the afternoon the Queen wandered over to see how he was getting on.’
