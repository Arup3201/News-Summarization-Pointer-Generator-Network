Imagine a diet on which you were permitted to stuff your face with biscuits while still losing weight.

Have you imagined it? Right. Well, now you can stop imagining, because there is one eating plan that claims to let you do precisely that.

The only catch is that you're only allowed six, specially formulated biscuits per day. So no reaching for the custard creams. And the biscuits are instead of meals. So put down that cutlery.

Dr Siegal's Cookie Diet, founded by Miami-based weight-loss expert Dr Sanford Siegal in 1975, is a retro, meal-replacement eating plan of the same ilk as Slim-Fast. And it's coming to Britain.

Can you lose weight by eating biscuits? Dr Siegal's diet claims to let you lose weight by eating low-calorie meal-replacement biscuits

The diet involves swapping breakfast, lunch and any snacks in between for just six of the brand's special 90-calorie biscuits - available in flavours including butterscotch, cinnamon oatmeal, chocolate brownie, blueberry, banana and maple syrup - or nine of the little 60-calorie ones.

You are permitted to eat a healthy, sensible dinner - just so long as your daily calorific intake does not top 1,200 calories.

The cookies - which, according to Madonna, made her then-husband Ritchie lose his sex drive in 2008 - are made from fibrous grains such as oats, fruit and amino acids. A week's supply will set you back upwards of £41.50, and the diet claims to help you drop 10lb per month.

But nutritional therapist Jo Lewin doesn't believe that nutritionally restrictive diets of this nature are the key to long-term weight loss:

Speaking
 to MailOnline, Jo said: 'Eating six cookies a day, with only one proper
 balanced meal is not seen as a healthy approach to weight loss.

'Restricting calories on a diet like 
this is unlikely to lead to long-term weight loss and may result in 
nutritional deficiencies. Since when has balanced nutrition been 
represented by a biscuit?

'This
 looks like another fad diet which is misleading to the public. 
Restricting the diet and food choices like this is more like to hinder 
our health than help it.

'For sustained, healthy weight loss you need adherence and compliance with a pattern of eating that works for you over time.

'You're
 better off starting a food diary, watching portion size and cutting out
 high sugar snacks than reaching for the cookie jar.'

Durable and portable: Dr Siegal says he chose to make his low-calorie food take the form of a biscuit because they are easy to carry and fit in a handbag

Speaking to MailOnline about whether 
he believes his diet is a healthy way to lose weight, Dr Siegal said: 
'Decidedly, yes. Any diet that safely takes weight off someone and gets 
them to their proper weight is a safe diet, because nothing is more 
unhealthy than being overweight.

'People on the Cookie Diet are not 
getting the nutrition they need, but that's the purpose. To lose weight 
you need to eat fewer calories than your body needs.

'But there's no question they are 
getting the vitamins and minerals they need becasue one of the 
instructions is to take a multivitamin - and in the US we give free 
vitamins with packs of cookies.

'As far as remaining healthy I have 
enough evidence of that over the years. I've been treating obesity for 
50 years and using the cookies since 1975. I've treated half a million 
patients and we have yet to have the first case of someone not getting 
enough vitamins.'

Dr Siegal's son Matthew, CEO of Dr Siegal's Cookie Diet, added: 'As long as you're eating fewer calories than your body needs to maintain it's weight, you will lose eight.

'And as for whether people will regain all the weight they lost when they resume "normal" eating.... well, if "normally" means their previous eating habits that got them overweight to begin with, then of course they will gain weight. But I'm a big believer in exercise as a means of maintaining goal weight.

'One of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to losing weight quickly is that once come off the diet you will regain the weight immediately. That's just silly. Once you 
reach your goal weight the only thing that will determine whether you gain 
weight is what you do from that point on.

'The method by which you lose weight has nothing to do with whether you go back to being overweight after.

'The Cookie
Diet takes you to a goal weight quickly and safely, but what you have beyond
 that is a lifetime of weight maintenance through healthy eating and 
exercise.'

Writing on his blog, Dr Siegal said: 
'In the early 1970's, after treating overweight patients exclusively for
 more than a decade, I came to the conclusion that hunger is the primary
 cause of diet failures.

'Through trial and error, I had 
determined that 800 calories a day produces the fastest rate of true fat
 loss and is quite safe under the supervision of a trained physician.

'Of course, without strong hunger 
suppression, an 800 calorie diet would be difficult to follow due to 
hunger. I knew that, if I could control their hunger, I could help my 
patients faithfully follow the low calorie diet that I favored.

'I decided to try to create a food that was particularly controlling of
 hunger while relatively low in calories. After several years of 
experimentation in my home kitchen, I developed a blend of particular 
amino acids (food proteins) that proved to be quite hunger suppressing 
and I baked it into a cookie.

'I
 chose a cookie because it's durable; doesn't need refrigeration; fits 
in a purse or briefcase; and is enjoyed by nearly everyone. I was 
careful to make my cookie taste good but not too good.'
