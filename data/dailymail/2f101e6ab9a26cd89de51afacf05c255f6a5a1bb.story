CLAXTON By Mark Cocker (Jonathan Cape £14.99) 

A Jay perched on a stump in Norfolk woodland

Claxton is a small village eight miles south-east of Norwich and, when naturalist Mark Cocker moved there 13 years ago, the population numbered just 244.

Yet that simple statement is wholly deceptive — for what are a few human households compared with the teeming world of plant, insect, bird and animal life that also inhabits the area?

At the end of this series of Field Notes From A Small Planet, Cocker supplies complete lists of the species he has recorded in his parish: fungi, plants, slugs, snails, millipedes, spiders, grasshoppers, butterflies, moths, micro-moths (yes!), beetles, flies, ants, bees, wasps, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. And more.

Like a geek I started to count them all, then abandoned the task. But it won’t come as a surprise to any gardener to know there are 11 sorts of slugs and snails. Cocker finds fascination and majesty, if not beauty, in everything.

In light of what we know about how species are threatened, this Norfolk richness might seem miraculous — yet there is more to this story than numbers. Claxton is a beautifully-written account of one man’s passion for the natural world, a collection of precise, monthly observations, but also subtle warnings that unless we treat nature with respect, we will pay the price.

In that context, the author’s meticulous lists are a form of evidence. I have no doubt that, within 20 years, he and his friends will be checking to see what remains unthreatened.

Mark Cocker has written nature columns for many years and locates the reader by his side on his walks through the Norfolk countryside

Cocker has written nature columns for many years, and while this is, in some ways, a collection of that journalism, it is much more. Observations from different years are arranged month-by-month to build an overview of how the year turns in the author’s beloved place.

He explains: ‘It is also a celebration of the way in which a particular location can give shape and meaning to one’s whole outlook.’

So inspiring is this process, so completely does Cocker locate you by his side on his walks, I confess that the few excursions outside Norfolk didn’t work for me; you really don’t want to be dragged from his East coast world to Morocco, Greece, Buxton or the M6 near Birmingham.

Cooker describes the ‘dog-like calls’ of geese overhead and takes in his natural surroundings in perfect prose

What you do want is imaginatively to stand beside him as (in January) he hears the ‘dog-like calls’ of geese overhead (how precise that is) and watches thousands of rooks roosting — recording their movements in masterly prose: ‘And they fell earthwards, almost uncontrollably, so that they reminded me of some last bonfire of a lifetime’s papers, each charred page rising, falling and twisting in a vent of boiled air.’ Magnificent.

In March, he watched lapwings ‘twist and rock crazily over the Earth’ and their wild cries remind him of a beloved friend who has recently died. The joy he sees in the birds’ movements has a profoundly healing effect. Yet, Cocker adds sadly, ‘as a society we have yet to value truly or to find a means to harness fully’ the succour the natural world can offer to human sorrow.

Cocker is mad about the humblest moth, views trees as infinitely generous in their gifts, marvels at the fact that jays plant 5,000 acorns every autumn (for later retrieval) and even counts the radials on a spider’s web, calculating that she had linked her silk lines 1,332 times to make the sphere.

In March, he watched lapwings ‘twist and rock crazily over the Earth’ and their wild cries remind him of a beloved friend who has recently died

His powers of patient observation are thrilling, and he lures you outside, wherever you live — that’s his intention: ‘My hope is that readers might be inspired to look more closely at their own immediate surroundings.’

He is no sentimentalist. On the contrary, he rages against ignorance and neglect. Noting that half our thrushes have gone in the past 30 years, he asks: ‘Why are we so complacent about our loss of wildlife? What price should we put on the song thrush’s priceless song? How dare we not make that song a political issue?’

Do politicians care about our wildlife? He thinks not — which is why I’d give every MP this exceptional book in their Christmas stocking.
