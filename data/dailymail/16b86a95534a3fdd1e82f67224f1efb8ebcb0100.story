The Union of Fans have demanded the Rangers board clarify reports that the naming rights to Ibrox had been sold to Mike Ashley for £1.

Sportsmail had revealed in March last year that a deal had been struck with the Sports Direct owner. However, it was reported on Thursday that the rights had been given away for next to nothing - provoking fury and disbelief among some elements of the Rangers support.

‘The Union of Fans are extremely concerned at newspaper reports suggesting that the naming rights to Ibrox have been sold to Mike Ashley for £1,’ read a statement issued on Thursday night. ‘We would ask the board to clarify as a matter of urgency whether the naming rights have indeed been sold and if so whether they have been sold for £1.

Change? Rangers' Ibrox stadium could be renamed the Sports Direct Arena by Newcastle owner Mike Ashley

Controversial figure: Ashley, who has shares in Rangers, bought Ibrox naming rights two years ago

‘The board cannot allow this type of accusation to go unanswered on a very important topic to fans.’

Meanwhile, another major fans group says it will take part in the club’s upcoming £4million share issue.

The Rangers Supporters Trust says it does not want to see it’s current 0.86 per cent stake in the club diluted when the open offer closes on September 12.

The crisis-hit Ibrox outfit have warned that should existing shareholders not take up the 19.8million new shares being put up for sale then the ‘future of the company will be uncertain’.

It comes after season-ticket sales dropped to 23,000 - down from 38,000 last season.

Back on the brink: If the shares issues fails to reach at least £3m then Rangers' future could be uncertain again

But now the RST has followed rival supporter group Rangers First by announcing it will take part in the share offer.

In a statement, the group said: ‘As shareholders in Rangers International Football Club (RIFC) we have decided unanimously to partake in the upcoming open offer. This will be carried out using funds from our BuyRangers fan ownership scheme.

“Whilst we still have deep concerns about the current situation at the club, as a board we believe that given fan ownership is the raison d’etre of the organisation it is in our members interest to participate in the open offer to maintain our current shareholding.’

Failed attempt: Ashley has twice tried to rebrand Newcastle's St James' Park ground

No go: Newcastle fans strongly protested against Ashley's stadium rebranding before it was changed back
