British spies today admitted they can access  mobile phone and email records without a warrant - if they are handed over by American or other foreign intelligence agencies.

The Government has until now insisted its GCHQ eavesdropping centre does not use information gathered in the States to bypass restrictions on the what information can be gathered in Britain.

But in court documents released today, GCHQ admitted it scoops up information of 'unanalysed intercepted communications content' from its US intelligence partner without a warrant.

Special relationship: British spies at GCHQ are allowed to mine American citizen's telephone calls and emails without a warrant and with the agreement of the NSA 

Campaign group Privacy International said the revelation exposed 'a huge gap in protection for British people'.

A spokesman for the organisation, which is suing the UK spy agency alongside Liberty and Amnesty International, said: 'The British public had been consistently persuaded by government over the last year that GCHQ are not using the NSA as a backdoor to sidestep protection in the law.'

It means UK spies can help themselves to data collected by the US National Security Agency without any oversight. GCHQ - which has refused to comment - has not revealed whose phone and email records it has trawled through.

The agreement between the NSA and GCHQ allows the UK to store anything discovered in the data for up to two years.

But this deadline can be extended unilaterally by 'senior UK officials' if they believe it to be necessary for national security purposes.

GCHQ was forced to draw back the veil on some of their top secret policies during a legal challenge to their practices following whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations about the NSA last year. 

Amongst the legal challengers were Amnesty International and the British civil rights advocates, Liberty.

'We now know that data from any call, internet search, or website you visited over the past two years could be stored in GCHQ's database and analysed at will, all without a warrant to collect it in the first place,' said Privacy International deputy director Eric King to the Guardian.

Revelations: Edward Snowden exposed the full extent of the NSA and GCHQ's surveillance on British and American citizens

'It is outrageous that the government thinks mass surveillance, justified by secret 'arrangements' that allow for vast and unrestrained receipt and analysis of foreign intelligence material is lawful.'

Generally, the UK's intelligence gathering and data sharing is governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which generally demands a warrant for private data interception.

However, the legal challenge has exposed the fact that the British and GCHQ do not deem a warrant necessary every time.

'A Ripa interception warrant is not as a matter of law required in all cases in which unanalyzed intercepted communications might be sought from a foreign government,' states the document made public and sent by GCHQ to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which is the British intelligence watchdog.

Following the revelations of U.S. intelligence worker Edward Snowden, GCHQ has been on the defensive over how it shares data with American spies.

British lawmakers briefed by the agency have assured the public that a warrant was in place 'in each case where GCHQ sought information from the U.S.'

A Government spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.'
