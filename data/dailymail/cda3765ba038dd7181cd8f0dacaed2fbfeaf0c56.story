Everton's players appeared in buoyant mood ahead of Thursday evening's Europa League clash with Dynamo Kiev.

Roberto Martinez's side hold a 2-1 advantage going into the second leg of their last 16 tie and were full of smiles as they boarded the plane to Ukraine on Wednesday morning.

The rest of the Blues squad also seemed to be in a good mood after Everton - who have struggled in the Premier League this season - eased lingering relegation fears with a confident 3-0 victory over Newcastle on Sunday.

Aaron Lennon, who is ineligible having played for Tottenham earlier in the competition, travelled with the squad as did Aiden McGeady and John Stones who both missed the victory over the Magpies. However, Kevin Mirallas was not seen to board the flight.

Dynamo Kiev, meanwhile, have announced that the Olympic Stadium, which holds 70,000, has sold out for the visit of the Toffees bar the section closed off by UEFA following crowd trouble in the previous round against Guingamp.

With some suggesting a European campaign can have an adverse affect on a side's Premier League form, Everton have experienced mixed fortunes when playing straight after a fixture on the continent this campaign.

The Merseysiders have won three of their matches played directly after a Europa League fixture, drawing two and losing four.

However, despite finding things tough domestically, Everton have impressed in the Europa League - getting the better of Bundesliga high-flyers Wolsfburg in the group stage before beating Swiss side Young Boys 7-2 on aggregate - and will be hoping to go all the way to Warsaw for the final in May.
