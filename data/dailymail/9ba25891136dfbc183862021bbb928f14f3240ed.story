Venus Williams continued her encouraging form with a 6-1 6-4 victory over Swiss Timea Bacsinszky.

The elder Williams sister has enjoyed her best season for some time, reaching the final in Montreal earlier this month, and next meets Sara Errani, who she has never lost to.

It is the first time Williams has made it through to the third round since 2010, when she went on to reach the semi-finals.

The 34-year-old said: 'The last couple of years I fought really hard and I really played red-hot opponents. So it wasn't like I didn't try.

'Sometimes you don't win them. That's why you get up and you live to fight another day. So that's really what it's about for me.

'I'm happy I won a match again. Finally I did something I couldn't do the last couple of years. That's good stuff.'

Powerful: Williams has faced some 'red-hot' opponents in the opening rounds in the last few years
