These dramatic images show the moment a six-year-old boy tried to climb to his fifth floor home - but then became stuck on a building ledge 60ft above the ground.

The boy attempted the climb after getting locked out of his home in Suining, southwest China's Sichuan Province.

But when he reached the sixth floor roof ledge just above his apartment, the boy became stuck.

He was spotted shivering on the slim ledge, with his back pressed tightly against the building, by concerned neighbours who called emergency services.

Firefighters arrived at the scene and one officer had to climb out on to the ledge to reach the boy.

He then managed to pull him to safety.Â
