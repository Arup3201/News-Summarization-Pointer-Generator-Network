A couple who were doing more than catching up on their paper work in a Christchurch insurance office unwittingly also gave patrons of a nearby bar a proper night’s adult entertainment.

The office sex romp took place last Friday night in the Marsh Ltd offices when the two employees left the lights on in the building on Papanui Road while they got to know each other better. 

Unfortunately for them their fun was filmed and photographed by revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery across the street who posted images on Facebook and Twitter.

The young couple get to know each other in the Marsh Ltd offices in Christchurch 

The couple had gone into the office after it had closed thinking they'd get some privacy when they were actually being watched by patrons across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery

Before long the pair start to undress in the office unaware that they were being watched

The couple even enjoyed a glass of wine as they enjoyed their own private party

Customers across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery got a front-row seat for the show

Stuff.co.nz reported that the photos have attracted thousands of likes and hundreds of shares.

'The whole pub knew about it and was watching, while they were totally oblivious to it. And afterwards celebrating with wine,' one man posted.

'They should have turned the lights out,' said another. 

Some patrons even said that the band stopped playing while most of the bar watched out the windows.

It got so steamy that the band even stop playing in the Carlton Bar and Eatery as the action continued

Marsh Ltd chief executive Grant Milne said the company was taking the matter seriously.

The man and woman had been identified and an employment investigation was under way.

'We know who is involved. It's obvious from the photos,' Milne said.

Milne would not say if the man and woman had returned to work, but that they were taking the matter very seriously and they may end up losing their jobs.

'It's not the type of behaviour we condone. It's very disappointing,' he said.

All the unwanted online publicity was also embarrassing the company and this was not how they wanted to be portrayed.

Revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery posted images on Facebook and Twitter of the couple

'One of the challenges of social media is the inability to control things,' he said.

Carlton owner James Murdoch said the bar had been in contact with Marsh Ltd.

'Obviously they're customers and we're working through it with them,' he said.

The couple could still escape with a warning if a disciplinary inquiry finds that the encounter did not amount to serious misconduct.
