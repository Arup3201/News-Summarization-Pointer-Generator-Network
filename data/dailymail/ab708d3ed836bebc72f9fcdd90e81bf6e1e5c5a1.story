Zimbabwe has defended its decision to send 62 baby elephants to zoos in China, France and the United Arab Emirates, saying the country is 'overpopulated' with the animal. 

Buyers from China want 27, the UAE 15, and France between 15 to 20, in deals that conservationists have described as 'ethically unconscionable'.

Jerry Gotora, head of Zimbabwe's parks and wildlife management authority, said its elephant population was not sustainable. The country had 80,000 elephants, but only had a 'capacity' for 42,000, he said.

Frank Pope, from the charity Save The Elephants, said elephants are among the 'most intelligent and socially conscious' in the animal kingdom and the effects of taking babies from their mothers are 'awful to contemplate'

According to The Times, Walter Mzembi, Zimbabwe's tourism minister, has said money from the sales would help to fund the country's national parks.

The volume of sales pale in comparison to the 30,000 elephants that are killed illegally each year to meet China's demands for ivory. 

But the sale has further highlighted the stark differences of opinion in the wild animal trade.

South Africa, is campaigning to legalise the trade in rhino horns. The country is home to 73 per cent of the world's wild rhinoceroses and claims that the existing ban has failed and if the trade was legalised it would poaching less attractive.

Conservationists claim that would only increase demand in Asia for illegal sales, something they claim happened after the Convention on International trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) authorised two one-off sales in ivory in 1999 and 2008. 

Frank Pope, from the charity Save The Elephants, said elephants are among the 'most intelligent and socially conscious' in the animal kingdom and the effects of taking babies from their mothers are 'awful to contemplate'. 

Cynthia Moss, director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants said separating baby elephants from their mothers was 'despicable'.

At least one of the elephants calves exported from Zimbabwe in a similar shipment two years ago lives alone in a cage in Taiyuan zoo, China.

Trading in African elephants is prohibited as the animal is critically endangered.

Zimbabwe is one of four countries, with South Africa, Botswana and Nambia, that were granted an exemption by Cites in 1997.

Cites told the newspaper that they do not consider African elephants in Zimbabwe to be 'threatened with extinction'. 

Since 1997 Zimbabwe has been allowed to 'trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations'.
