colourWhite: The celebrity chef is definitely not in the pink after being told to repaint his 15th century hotel

When Marco Pierre White chose to repaint his 15th century hotel a shade of pink, he perhaps thought it would add to the colourful palette used on old buildings in Suffolk villages.

But the chef is being forced to repaint his historic hotel after locals complained that the Grade-II listed building looked like 'blancmange' as he has not used the traditional Suffolk Pink.

Villagers had asked planning officials to investigate after the outside walls of the Angel Hotel, which dominates the market place in the medieval village of Lavenham, were changed from cream to pink.

One of the upset local residents said: 'It looks as if someone has got their history badly wrong - Suffolk pink is a traditional colour here and has been for centuries. But it is not that chocolate-box pink that people think it is.

'Real Suffolk Pink dates back to the 14th century or earlier. Then paints were coloured using whatever was to hand, and ox-blood was used to produce the colour properly recognised as Suffolk Pink.

'There is a rich pageant of old colours in this village - from red to yellow and rust to mustard -  and frankly the Angel looked ridiculous pink.

'It has changed colour over the years but no-one here can remember it being such a twee colour.' 

Another resident who lives just yards from the Angel said: 'It is a ghastly inappropriate colour and totally out of place in the middle of so many other buildings painted in proper sympathetic heritage colours.

'The job was done in a couple of days using cheap trade paint that was just slapped on - it's not even lime-wash which is what should be used on property in Lavenham.'

Parish council chairman Roy Whitworth, who once ran the Angel which Mr Pierre White took over two years ago, said: 'Villagers were generally appalled by the new colour - no-one liked it.'

Mr Pierre White upset villagers within days of taking over the hotel and pub when he refused to serve lager or Guinness, claiming it encouraged the wrong sort of people to the establishment, which was built as a tavern in around 1420.

'People here are already fairly cheesed off with Mr White because of the changes he made at the Angel and they would be very upset if he was allowed to get away with things,' said Mr Whitworth.

The controversial cook also made the headlines earlier this year when a judge branded him a 'wealthy idiot'.

Last night the hotel confirmed that the hotel would be repainted.

Manager Rob Jackson said: 'The building needed freshening up and Marco chose the colour but we have agreed to change it and instead have a much darker pink.

'We didn't need permission to change the colour but we are happy to change it and use one recommended by English Heritage.'
