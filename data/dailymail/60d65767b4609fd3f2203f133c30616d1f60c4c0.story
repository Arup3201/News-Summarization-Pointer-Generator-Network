There was no jackpot winner in Saturday's Powerball drawing and the estimated jackpot has surgedÂ  to a massive $400 million.

The giant jackpot will tie for the fourth largest of all time if a lucky resident of one of 43 states holds the golden ticket with all six winning numbers in Wednesday night's drawing.

It will also be the first winner in months after a string of 15 no-winner drawings marked a drought for most but a potential windfall for someone soon.

That winner, if there is one, will receive a projected $227.8M cash sum.

Saturday's numbers were 2, 9, 14, 21 and 23 with a Powerball of 3.

While
 the lottery made it official early Sunday that no one won the full 
prize, there was a spattering of smaller prize winners across the 
nation.

A $2 million ticket was sold in 
Texas, officials say.

Wednesday's jackpot could be the fourth largest Powerball win ever. Here are the top 10 largest draws:

And tickets worth $1 million were sold in Florida, Georgia, Iowa,
 Michigan, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

To win the million dollar prizes, players had to match all five regular number but miss out on just the Powerball number.

Powerball
 officials said in a statement that the previous estimated jackpot total
 was an annuitized $330.8 million, or $188.4 million as a cash option.

The odds of matching all six numbers in the game are 1 in about 175 
million, according to the Multi-State Lottery 
Association.

The last Powerball winner was Kevin Carlson, who bought his ticket at a Missouri convenience store and hit for $71.5M on Christmas Day last year.

Powerball
 is played in 43 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Tied for fourth: Bob Knowles buys a Powerball ticket prior to the last $400M drawing back in September
