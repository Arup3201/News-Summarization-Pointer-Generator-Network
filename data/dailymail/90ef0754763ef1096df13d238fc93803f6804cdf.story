The president of the United States is a man few would dare to offend.

But when you are the greatest basketball player the country has ever produced, it is possible to get away with a light-hearted jibe.   

According to a recent New York magazine interview, former presidential adviser David Axelrod (now strategic adviser for the Labour Party) said he wanted to get Barack Obama something special for his 50th birthday. 

Given the president had strong roots to Chicago, Mr Axelrod contacted Jordan (a Chicago Bulls legend) in the summer of 2011 to try and get him to sign a greeting for his boss. 

Former basketball star Michael Jordan signed a poster for the president spelling his name 'Barrack' 

When he received the signed poster, the president said 'I can't put this up, he misspelled my name!' 

He said: 'When the president turned 50, I wanted to get him something special...so I sent it to Jordan to have him sign it for me.

'To Barrack: you still owe me dinner. Wishing you well, Michael Jordan. 

'I gave it to the president, and he said, "I can't put this up, he misspelled my name!" So I said, "Fine, I'll take it.'" 

This is not the first time the basketball star has made fun of the US President.

Last year the NBA legend - who has a golf handicap of three - made a quip about Mr Obama (who is trying to get his handicap below 18) describing him as a 'hack' on the golf course.

He said: 'I've never played with Obama, but I would,' he said, before promptly changing his mind. 'But no - that's OK - I'd take him out. He's a hack. I'd be there all day playing with him.'

'Do you really want to say that?' former NFL star Ahmad Rashad asked, looking at the camera, bemused. 'He's the President of the United States - he's a hack?'

Jordan added: 'I never said he wasn't a great politician. I'm just saying he's a s***ty golfer.'

In the past, Mr Jordan has referred to the US President as a 'hack' on the golf course and a 's***ty golfer'
