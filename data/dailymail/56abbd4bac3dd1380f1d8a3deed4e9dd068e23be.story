San Lorenzo captain Juan Mercier was a little bitter after his side lost the Club World Cup against European champions Real Madrid on Saturday.

The 34-year-old has labelled the Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Co 'wimps' for falling to the ground every time they were touched at the Marrakesh Stadium in Morocco.

Real won 2-0 thanks to goals from Sergio Ramos and Bale, and Mercier has not taken defeat well.

'Every time you touched one of the wimps, they went tumbling over,' Mercier told Marca.

'You went in hard to close them down - foul. You threw yourself into a challenge - foul. 

'They should come and play over here for a while. We played the way we know how: they're not used to physical contact'.

He did, however, reserve some praise for Real's all-star forwards - Bale, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema.

'You realise that the three forwards never stand still for a moment. They run in front of you, then behind you, then one comes into the picture and another drifts away,' Mercier continued. 

'They're constantly on the move. The other day they didn't play the way we're used to from when we watch them on the telly.'
