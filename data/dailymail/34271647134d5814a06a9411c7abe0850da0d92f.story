Police have taken cadaver dogs to search sand hills on the NSW Central Coast after they received fresh leads on a man who disappeared 18 years ago in mysterious circumstances,

Ronald Penn, a 61-year-old railway worker, vanished from his Bateau Bay house on October 12, 1995, a short time before he was due to give evidence in court on a violence case.

Two weeks after his disappearance, Mr Penn's white Mazda van was found burnt-out in nearby bushland.

Fresh clues: After receiving a new lead police took a cadaver dog to the sandhills at Tuggerah Lakes to search for the body of railway worker Ronald Penn who vanished shortly before he was due to give evidence in a violence case

Sighting: A witness has come forward and told police that two indigenous men and a a Caucasian man were seen leaving the site of a burning Mazda van in the bushland area where missing Ronald Penn's burnt out vehicle was found 18 years ago

After receiving fresh information last month, police began a search of sand hills in the Tuggerah Lakes area.

Detectives from Strike Force Rankmore, which was formed to investigate Mr Penn’s disappearance, have interviewed a witness who said three men may have been in the near vicinity of Mr Penn’s car shortly after it was set alight around 10pm on October 27, 1995.

The witness described two of the men as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander appearance, and a third man as Caucasian.

All three were seen leaving the scene of the burning Mazda van in a red Ford Laser hatchback.

Detectives also received information suggesting Mr Penn’s body may be buried in the sand hills where they commenced their search with a cadaver dog.

Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Command crime manager, Detective Inspector David Waddell, said his detectives would continue their inquiries in the ensuing days and weeks.

'We are absolutely committed to solving this case and putting those responsible for Mr Penn’s death behind bars,' Inspector Waddell said.

'Mr Penn’s family and friends have suffered for far too long; they need to know what happened to Ron.

'The information and support we have received from members of the community has been invaluable, and we are very grateful for the help they have provided.

'If there is anyone else out there who can assist detectives, please do get in touch. We don’t need to know who you are; all we need is the information you have to hand. You can contact Crime Stoppers anonymously and your call will be treated in the strictest of confidence.'

Investigations have revealed Mr Penn had his clothes and personal belongings with him when he vanished. None of his bank accounts have been accessed and his driver’s licence has not been renewed since he went missing.

In a separate case, police divers in central Queensland are preparing to search for the remains of a couple who have been missing, believed murdered, for more than a year.

Acting on a public tip-off, the divers will search Lake Awoonga near Gladstone for the remains of Chantal Barnett and Robert Martinez.

Detective Senior Sergeant Scott Moon says the Rockhampton couple were last seen in late February or early March last year. Police believe they were murdered.

Detective Moon called for anyone with information about the whereabouts of Ms Barnett and Mr Martinez to come forward.

'We are very confident that people residing in Rockhampton know what happened to Robert and Chantal,' he said in a statement.

'Regardless of how trivial you think the information might be, please come forward and speak with police.'
