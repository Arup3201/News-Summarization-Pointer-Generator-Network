A 48-year-old Montana man arrested for running a child-pornography ring told the FBI that the online community was his family and all he had in the world.

Paul Wencewicz started the 'Kingdom of Future Dreams' in 2009 from his home in smalltown Polson, Montana after another site he belonged to got shut down.

Over the course of two and a half years, members in the online community shared over 300,000 lewd images of children - mostly underage girls.

Ringleader: Polson, Montana resident Paul Wencewicz started a child pornography website in 2009 and now faces more than 20 years in prison. Above, his last known address in Polson according to public records

About 40 men were members of the site, and were organized into a hierarchy with Wencewicz at the top and new members branded 'castle dwellers' on the bottom, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports.

Conspirator: Jonathan Godson of the Isle of Jersey took down the Kingdom of Future Dreams after receiving a tip from Wencewicz. But the Channel Islands resident kept a backup of the site at his home and it was confiscated about two weeks later

Castle dwellers were vetted before they were allowed to work their way up the hierarchy to gain access to the most disturbing images on the site.

One of the most active members in the community was 57-year-old postal worker Steve Humiston, who Wencewicz told authorities participated for the attention.

The Tacoma, Washington resident and Air Force veteran joined the site in November 2009 and posted more than 4,500 times before the site was shut down.

He posted so much that Wencewicz confronted him, telling him to scale back for fear of attracting too much attention.

Apparently Humiston just wanted to be appreciated for all of his hard work tracking down 'rare collections'.

'I’ve come to the realization in the past that I do this for myself and for the few that may appreciate it,' Wencewicz said in a note to Humiston.

'You are very hard to keep up with sometimes, and that ain’t a bad thing!' Wencewicz continued. 'I will say that you don’t get NEAR enough credit to all the hard work you do.'

But all of that came crashing down on March 14, 2012 when the FBI raided Wencewicz's beer bottle strewn home in Polson.

After his arrest, Wencewiz told authorities that he 'felt like his entire family was taken away when the bulletin board was shut down' and that the Kingdom was all he had.

Initially Wencewicz handed over the site to the authorities, but soon after posted on a music board warning another site operator - Richard Godson - that he had been caught.

'Castle dwellers': Thanks to Godson's back-up of the site, federal authorities were able to bring 15 of the some 40 members to justice. Above, Ian Nosek (left) and Jeffrey Wooley (right), two of the men caught in the ring

Godson, a resident of the Isle of Jersey in the Channel Islands, quickly destroyed the site but decided to keep a backup on a hard drive at his home.

Authorities raided Godson's home some two weeks later and arrested him, taking into their posession the hard drive which they used to arrest a total of 15 men involved in the ring.

So far, 13 of the men arrested have either plead guilty or agreed to plea deals. Mo

Humiston was arrested on April 17, 2013 - about a year after the raid on Wencewicz's home.

Wencewicz is set to be sentenced on July 10 at face at least 20 years in prison, while Humiston will receive his on July 24.
