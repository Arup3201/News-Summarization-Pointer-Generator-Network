The Court of Arbitration for Sport has lifted Morocco's ban from the next two editions of the African Cup of Nations that was imposed by the Confederation of African Football.

The North-African nation was expelled from the 2017 and 2019 tournaments and was fined $1 million by the CAF. 

The CAF also demanded a further $9 million in compensation, after the country pulled out because of fears related to the Ebola epidemic.

CAS said that the sanctions have been set aside, 'with the exception of the fine, which is however reduced to $50,000.'

Morocco was disqualified from this year's tournament after withdrawing as host just two months before the start of the competition. 

Their national federation cited health risks from fans travelling from Ebola-affected regions. 

It asked for a delay but CAF refused and the tournament was moved to Equatorial Guinea.
