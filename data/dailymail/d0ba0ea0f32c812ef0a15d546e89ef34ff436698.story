Furious: Fiona Cunningham, Theresa May's spin doctor, was said to be incensed by attacks on her lover Charles Farr

The feud between two senior Cabinet colleagues may centre on toxic allegations about ministerial failure to address the threat of terrorism and an alleged refusal to heed warnings of a plot by extremist Muslims to take over several schools in Birmingham.

But behind it lies a fascinating tale of two Home Office civil servants who are having an affair together.

One of those involved is a no-nonsense Scottish divorcee, Fiona Cunningham, 40, who is Home Secretary Theresa May’s devoted spin doctor. For two years, she has been in a close relationship with her colleague Charles Farr, 54, a former spy chief who runs the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism in the Home Office.

When they were both criticised by officials in Michael Gove’s Education Department, Miss Cunningham went into full-blooded attack mode.

I’m told she immediately mounted an operation that would have been worthy of the attack dogs once employed by Gordon Brown, who conducted smear campaigns against not only opposition Tory MPs, but against people on their own side, too.

Miss Cunningham is a former journalist with Sky TV who is now one of the most powerful figures in the Home Office, advising on everything from policy to Mrs May’s clothes and trademark designer shoes.

Under fire from Mr Gove’s officials, who had accused the Home Secretary of being reluctant to confront the threat of terrorists strongly enough, Miss Cunningham was particularly furious that, by implication, the reputation of her lover (who, as a civil servant, is unable to answer his critics in public) was being maligned.

Mischievously, BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, suggested on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday that the relationship between the ex-spy chief and the adviser was a ‘complicating factor’ in the war of words between the two Ministers.

His report caused outrage in the Home Office, which is convinced he was put up to it by Mr Gove’s officials, a charge both Robinson and Gove’s camp deny. Whatever the truth, the relationship between Miss Cunningham (whose marriage to a journalist ended in divorce six years ago) and Mr Farr has caused a stir in Whitehall.

‘If the person who is giving the advice is in love with the individual who is meant to be considering the merits of the advice, it is understandable that it is a cause for some alarm,’ says one official.

Indeed, Mr Farr, who worked for MI6 in the Eighties, is not popular among colleagues.

He has even upset the mild-mannered Shami Chakrabarti, director of the pressure group Liberty. Having described herself once as ‘an irritant to six democratically elected secretaries of state’, she said she was ‘generally treated with courtesy and even kindness in their [the ministers] company.’ But she added: ‘By contrast, Mr Farr is the only person ever to shout at me in the Home Office.’

Mr Farr wears thinly rimmed spectacles that give him an owlish appearance and once led the Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, to describe him as ‘a grown-up Harry Potter’.

Educated at Monkton Combe, a private boys’ school in Somerset, and Magdalen College, Oxford, Mr Farr did a PhD in the philosophy of aesthetics — not maths or modern languages, the normal subjects for a spy.

After university, he joined MI6, working in southern Africa and the Middle East. He was once assigned to fly round Afghanistan in a helicopter, with thousands of dollars in cash, trying to persuade farmers not to grow opium.

He has never married and, typical of his character, his relationship with Miss Cunningham has been conducted discreetly. They don’t live together and are rarely seen in public together.

The other pair in this poisonous feud - Mrs May and Mr Gove - have history, too. The slow-burning fuse that finally resulted in yesterday’s explosion was lit when they first became Cabinet Ministers in 2010.

She was a surprise choice to be Home Secretary, having never held the brief in Opposition. For his part, Mr Gove has a long record of calling for an uncompromising hard line on Islamic terrorism.

In his book, Celsius 7/7, published in 2006, the year after the terrorist bombs in London, the former Times journalist accused the West of spawning extremist terror through a policy of appeasing fundamentalism.

Crucially, he believes the Home Office is guilty of this charge.

Indeed, the two Ministers clashed at a recent meeting of the Extremism Task Force, which was set up after the murder of drummer Lee Rigby by Islamic extremists in Woolwich last year.

Mr Gove considered the Home Office had not acted firmly enough against hardline Islamic preachers.

However, his position was opposed by Mrs May – backed by loyal aide Mr Farr – who believes in a more softly-softly approach.

As a result, Mr Gove was out-manoeuvred by Mrs May, who is well-known for fiercely resisting any attempts by fellow Ministers to ‘encroach’ on her policy area.

Not to be outdone, Mr Gove contacted the Prime Minister, who is a close friend, to put his case.

Mrs May duly found out much later - and has been spoiling for revenge ever since.

But it’s not just differences over the response to Islamic terrorism that have Mr Gove and Mrs May at daggers drawn.

Although Gove regards her as a competent Minister who can master a complex brief, he sees her as incapable of innovative and independent thought. This, he believes, rules her out as party leader.

As for Mrs May, she regards Mr Gove as an intellectual snob who spends too much time scheming and plotting. She is angry, too, that he does not accord her the respect she thinks her more elevated Cabinet position deserves.

Nothing stops her, though, ‘encroaching’ on his turf. Last spring, she made a speech that ranged beyond her Home Office brief, suggesting that people who run Mr Gove’s much-loved ‘free’ schools should be allowed to make profits for themselves.

The speech was seen as a signal of her leadership ambitions.

Mr Gove was incensed, and during a Cabinet session a few days later, he angrily declared his ‘shock at seeing some around the table participating in leadership speculation’. Everyone in the room, including David Cameron knew he was referring to May.

Despite the provocation, a furious Mrs May remained at the table stony-faced. However, she was even more enraged when a word-perfect account of the exchange was leaked to the Press.

To add to the explosive mix, it was revealed this week that Mrs May has, for the first time, topped a ‘league table’ of Cabinet Ministers after Tory activists were asked to give an approval rating - edging George Osborne and Mr Gove into second and third place.

She is also ahead of Boris Johnson, in the same poll, over who should eventually succeed Mr Cameron.

She scored 35 per cent, Mr Johnson 23 per cent and Mr Gove 7.9 per cent, down from 15 per cent three months ago.

The drop in the popularity of Mr Gove, who professes no leadership ambitions and backs Mr Osborne to succeed the Prime Minister, could be because he is perceived as being involved in too many unnecessary controversies.

This feeling will undoubtedly increase after the Queen’s Speech was overshadowed by the row between him and Mrs May.

Significantly, it was Mr Gove whom No 10 officials ordered to issue a conciliatory statement yesterday.

As for his bitter rival, Mrs May may not be an intellectual titan - but we’re quickly learning that she is a formidable political bruiser whom colleagues cross at their peril.
