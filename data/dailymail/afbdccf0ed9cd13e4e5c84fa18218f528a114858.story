An aspiring model who was turned down for a smear test because doctors said she was too young to get cervical cancer has died from the disease.

Sophie Jones, 19, from Eastham, near Liverpool, was initially told she had Crohn's Disease when she went to the doctor complaining of stomach pains last February.

But she was diagnosed with cervical cancer last November after being admitted to hospital when her condition worsened, and died early on Saturday morning.

Now her family and friends have launched an online petition calling for smear tests to be offered to women from the age of 16, rather than 25.  Entitled 'Sophie's Choice', the petition has been signed by more than 45,000 people since its publication on Saturday,and 10,000 of them in a three-hour period this morning.

'The life and soul of everything': Sophie Jones, 19, has died of cervical cancer after being refused a smear test

Last Facebook picture: Miss Jones, who posted this photo two weeks ago, died early on Saturday morning

Miss Jones was described by her sister, Stephanie, as 'a very calming influence on everyone around her'

While the disease is the most common cancer in women under 35, it is so rare in those under 25 that screening for it is not offered to women until they are 25.

Today Miss Jones' mother, Peri Jones, 47, said it was 'just ridiculous' that smear tests were only offered routinely to those over 25.

She said: 'At the very least people should be given a choice.  The cost of what Sophie has been through on the NHS is far more than a smear test - however many months ago would have been. 

'Sophie knew something was wrong, she knew her body was telling her something but because of her age it wasn't even considered.'

She added: 'She was the person that kept us all together as a family, stopped us falling out and was there for everyone.'

She said her daughter, who did PR for nightclubs, had been trying to launch her modelling career when she was finally diagnosed with cancer, by which time it was too late.

Mrs Jones said: 'Sophie was amazing - she was more concerned about all of us than she was about herself.  Her positive attitude was incredible.'

Sophie' sister, Stephanie Jones, said she had vowed to fight the disease 'to the end'.

She
 said: 'She was still in high spirits even on the morning she died; she 
was the life and soul of everything, and just lit the place up.

Killer disease: Miss Jones, from Eastham, was admitted to hospital in November after her condition worsened

Model: The teenager had suffered from stomach pains and was initially told she probably had Crohn's Disease

Miss Jones, pictured with her boyfriend Jake Molyneux, was 'in high spirits' the day she died, her sister said

'She was always a very calming influence on everyone around her, and she loved being with her friends.'

She added: 'This should never, ever have happened to her.  Sophie said she would fight it all the way to the end.

'It’s
 totally wrong that people are getting refused even when they know 
something isn’t right. Everybody knows their own body, and Sophie knew 
she wasn’t well.'

The family had been fundraising to take Miss Jones on a final holiday, but she died before she had the chance to go.

Should routine cervical smear testing start younger than 25?

Should routine cervical smear testing start younger than 25?

Now share your opinion

Now her family and friends have launched an online petition demanding that the 
minimum age for having a smear test be lowered
 to 16.

The lower age limit for routine testing in England is 25 because the condition is so rare. No girls under the age of 20 died from the disease between 2009 and 2011, according to Cancer Research UK’s most recent statistics.

Dr Claire Knight, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, told MailOnline young women should be reassured that cervical cancer is so rare in women under 25.

She said:  'It is very rare for women who are still in their teens to be diagnosed with cervical cancer; there have been around 25 in the last decade.

'But it’s important to go to your GP if you notice anything unusual, like pain or discomfort during sex, bleeding in between periods, after sex or after the menopause, or unpleasant vaginal discharge.

'It may well be caused by something much less serious than cancer, but it’s a good idea to get it checked.'

The Sophie’s Choice online petition has already collected more than 39,000 signatures since it was started on Saturday.

Miss Jones' family say her death should never have happened and want younger girls to have cervical screening

Miss Jones' family and friends are now calling for younger women to be offered cervical cancer screening

Family friend Pamela Keelan, who set up the petition on the day Sophie died, said she hoped to prevent other girls suffering the same fate.

The petition reads: 'A friend and amazing young girl, our Sophie has had her life cut short after experiencing symptoms for over a year and being in horrendous pain and even asking for a smear.

'But because of her age - 19 -  she was refused time and time again and now she has terminal cervical cancer.

'Out of loads of doctors, it took that one to say "We will check you properly", but then it was too late.

'Our Sophie has been failed in the worst way, and I need 500,000 signatures to be heard, one million to get this changed hopefully.'

Screening: The test is currently offered to women aged 25 or over

The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years.

It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb).

A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis.  Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment.

Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young.  According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011.

The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good.

The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety.

Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland.  In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year.  In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active.

Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later.  Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.
