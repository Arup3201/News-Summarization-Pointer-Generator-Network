As rock ’n’ roll neighbours they are already embroiled in an inharmonious war of words but now Robbie Williams has upped the ante in his feud with Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page.

The former Take That star has submitted further planning proposals for his new home, which include building a huge basement complete with swimming pool.

His first submission to modernise the £17.5million property is the subject of a strongly-worded complaint by Page. As the Mail reported last week, the veteran guitarist, 71, claims the works could damage the surrounding mansions in Holland Park, West London.

Undoubtedly he will be raging at the new plans, which will entail many weeks – if not months – of heavy drilling and excavation work if approved by council officials.

In his submission, Williams says he is trying to turn the 46-room house into a modern family home. The singer lives in the building with his wife Ayda Field, 35, and their two children, daughter Theodora Rose, two, and three-month-old son Charlton Valentine. 

The Grade II-listed Victorian property last belonged to film director Michael Winner, who died in 2013. Nearby is Tower House, Page’s Grade I property, which was saved from demolition in the 1960s following a campaign led by John Betjeman and Evelyn Waugh.

Williams, 40, submitted his initial plans last month, which include a car park in the garden, a new recording studio and lift, partly filling in a swimming pool and adding a window.

He said the building works would last for nine months.

But father of five Page, who has lived in Tower House for four decades and considers it one of the most important buildings in the borough, has sent an official complaint to Kensington and Chelsea Council.

In a stern letter, he stated the window would overlook the side of his home and thus have ‘significant impact on the amenity of the house and its garden’.

He was also ‘extremely concerned’ the works would create an eyesore in the area and that the vibrations caused by them could damage surrounding properties, including his own. 

The famous pair have lived next door to each other for more than a year but have fallen out over the plans

Williams bought the house - which is the former home of Michael Winner - with his wife Ayda Field in 2013 

Page - pictured (left) recently with his girlfriend Scarlett Sabet, 25, and (right) in Led Zeppelin's 1970s heyday - says Williams' home is Grade II listed and its exterior should be treated as 'sacrosanct'

And he insisted that the Grade II status of Williams’s home should mean its exterior is ‘sacrosanct’ and protected from change.

But Williams has refused to be cowed and this week submitted more plans. These would see a ‘like for like’ rebuilding of a first-floor balcony and a 3,600sq ft basement tunnelled out under his back garden.

The enormous extension would be more than four times the average size of a new-build home in England and Wales.

Page, who is dating aspiring actress Scarlett Sabet, 25, has not yet commented on the latest plans. But in his original letter he wrote: ‘I have been responsible for the protection of the Tower House for over 40 years and I am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the wellbeing of this important heritage asset.’

The council is expected to make its decision on the initial plans next month. Williams and Page declined to comment.
