Republicans have muscled a $1.1 trillion bill financing government agencies through the House after President Barack Obama phoned Democratic lawmakers and urged them to back the measure.

The House approved the measure late Thursday by 219-206, hours before a midnight deadline, avoiding a government shutdown. 

The compromise bill keeps agencies funded through next September.

After the measures passed the Republican's House leader John Boehner said with relief: 'Thank you and Merry Christmas'.

President Barack Obama phoned Democratic lawmakers and urged them to back the$1.1trillion bill that will keep government agencies funded through next September 

Many conservatives opposed it because it did not block Obama's recent executive actions on immigration. 

A large majority of House Democrats opposed it because of provisions easing some restrictions on banks and allowing higher political contributions by big donors.

Obama backed the bill and called wavering Democratic lawmakers to persuade them to help it pass.

The bill must now be approved by the Democratic-run Senate.

Funding for federal agencies was expiring at midnight. Lawmakers were ready to pass short-term legislation keeping government doors open. 

Earlier this week, Democrats complained bitterly in public about a portion of the $1.1 trillion measure that eases regulations imposed on big banks in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown — even though 70 members of party's rank and file supported an identical provision in a stand-alone bill late last year.

After a closed-door meeting, Democrats also chorused objections to separate section of the spending bill that eases limits on campaign contributions to political parties. 

The measure was passed hours before a midnight deadline - narrowly avoiding a government shutdown
