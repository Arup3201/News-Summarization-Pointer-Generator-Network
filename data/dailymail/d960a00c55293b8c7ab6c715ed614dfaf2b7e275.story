John Emery, 36, was ordered to pay back just £154,412 within six months - that would see him avoid a further two and a half years in prison

A fraudster involved in a £60 million 'Wolf of Wall Street' worthless share scam has been ordered to pay back just £154,000. 

Jon Emery, 36, from Romford in Essex, was part of team of conmen who set up an elaborate scheme in Madrid to sell over-valued or even worthless shares in companies. 

The deception - similar to the type orchestrated by Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort - played by Leonardo di Caprio in the Hollywood film - allowed the fraudsters to live a life of luxury, with yachts, private jets and a huge portfolio of plush mansions across the world. 

Emery was convicted last year of conspiring to defraud investors by dishonestly making, causing or permitting false representations between March 2003 and August 2007 and was jailed for five years. 

But he was ordered to pay back just £154,412 within six months - that would see him avoid a further two and a half years in prison - following a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Southwark Crown Court. 

The scheme was the brainchild of Australian Jeffery Revell-Reade, 49, and Anthony May, 48, who spent the cash on a lavish lifestyle including private jets and yachts.

Revell-Reade set up the business, under which sales entities operating from Madrid sold shares in US-listed companies on a fraudulent basis.

It was deliberately set up in Madrid as it was outside the immediate control of UK authorities and the Financial Service Authority.

Investors in the companies bought shares that had restrictions on their resale for a 12 month period.

When the investors came to sell the shares after the expiry of this period, they often found that they were unable to do so as they were worthless, and that the shares were in shell companies or companies that were not operating at all.

Revell-Reade and May recruited Emery, Daniel Gooding, 39, Gooding's sister, Emma Farmer, 40, Philip Morris, 38, Ian Hughes, 33 and Shaun Rumsey, 33, to reel in clients through hard-sell, cold-calling techniques.

The six fraudsters telephoned potential buyers in the UK to trick them into investing in the worthless companies.

In June this year, Revell-Reade and May were jailed for nine years and six months and seven years six months respectively for conspiracy to defraud. 

Last year, their six salesmen were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and jailed for a total of 29 years. But their convictions were only revealed this year when reporting restrictions were lifted.

The defendants were arrested between 2007 and 2009 and were charged in 2010. 

Last week, one of the six conmen, Hughes, was ordered to pay back £8,000 within six months or face a further five months in prison.
