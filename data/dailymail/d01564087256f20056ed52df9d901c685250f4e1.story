Not to be confused with the A66: Brewer Pete Fenwick had to change the name of one of his beers after Lodestar Anstalt said it infringed copyright on their trademark named after the iconic US route, pictured

You might have thought it would be difficult to confuse an icon of American culture with a trunk road in the north of England.

But drinks giant Lodestar Anstalt has threatened action against North Yorkshire micro-brewery Mithril Ales over its Route A66 real ale, claiming it infringes Lodestar’s own Route 66 trademark.

‘I’ve had to re-badge the ale as A66,’ said Mithril’s owner Pete Fenwick.

‘We’re just a little brewery and I can’t afford to fight it.’

Mr Fenwick said it was ‘ludicrous’ to suggest the A66, which runs east of Middlesbrough to Workington, could be confused with America’s 2,448-mile Route 66.

Trademark attorney Vicki Bennett, of Saunders & Dolleymore, which represented Lodestar, said: ‘The trademarks Route 66 and Route A66 are visually, phonetically and conceptually similar.

'Mithril Ales’ use of the mark for the sale of beer creates a likelihood of consumer confusion.’

Mr Fenwick, whose brewery is based near Darlington, received a letter from Lodestar's lawyers requesting that he change the name of his beer.

The letter also invited Mr Fenwick to offer a proposal for financial compensation to the firm.

He said that his beer still tastes the same but just has a different logo now.

Mr Fenwick said he was most offended by Lodestar's accusation that he was making a premium lager rather than his traditional ale.

The Lodestar Route 66 brand is registered in Europe for a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

Offence taken: Mr Fenwick was particularly offended that lawyers said he was producing a premium lager and not a quality real ale
