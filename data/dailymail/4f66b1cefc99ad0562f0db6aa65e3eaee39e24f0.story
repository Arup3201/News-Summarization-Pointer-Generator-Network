Motorists in Kansas are being targeted by a gunman who has shot at an estimated 20 cars injuring three people.

Police and FBI sources said they cannot confirm the exact number of attacks as investigators try to hunt down the main suspect.

On woman said she was driving down the road with her three-year-old child when a figure in a ski-mask driving beside her opened fire, narrowly missing the youngster.

Kansas City Police and the FBI had been offering a $7,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the unidentified suspect

Witness Tom McFarlane said he thought he heard a noise and when he pulled over, he found a bullet hole in his door

Witness Tom McFarlane told KMBC-TV: 'I was just driving down the highway and heard a loud noise. Something hit the car, didn't know what it was, so I pulled over at my first opportunity to kind of see if there was any damage and that's when I saw the bullet hole.'

Kansas City police believe many of the shootings may be linked but are trying to determine a motive for the attacks which have occurred along stretches of Interstates 435 and 470.

Local police called in help from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

A $7,000 reward has also been offered for information leading to the capture of the attacker.

The first incident was reported to police on March 8 and so far investigators have failed to identify the suspect.

Luckily, no one has been killed but two victims have been hit in the legs and a third received a gunshot wound to the arm.

Jenny Baugher said: 'It's really scary to think that somebody is just out here with no regard to what could happen.'

Another victim, Ginny Bauer said she was driving a friend home when she was hit by a bullet.

'There wasn't another car in sight and we were in the right lane and hit on the right side," she said

Former ATF assistant director Rich Marianos said such incidents are a great concern to the law-enforcement community.

He said: 'Anytime you have a random shooter with no reason or mindset behind them that [is] just taking rounds and putting them into cars is causing a problem for everyone.'
