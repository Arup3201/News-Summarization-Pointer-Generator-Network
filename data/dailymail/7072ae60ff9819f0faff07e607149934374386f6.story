If you’ve ever been worried about your dog getting lonely while you’re away, then this gadget could be for you.

iCPooch, an Internet-enabled device powered by a Raspberry Pi computer, allows dog owners to video chat with their pets and deliver dog treats from afar.

The device is the invention of Brooke Martin, 15, from Spokane, Washington.

‘My dog Kayla suffered from separation anxiety, so I thought it would be really cool to be able to video chat with her while I was away from home to make sure she was OK,’ Miss Martin told GeekWire.

‘The idea of delivering her a treat seemed liked it would really make her happy if I could figure out how to do it.’

The group describe the iCPooch device, which is still in the prototype stage, as ‘a combination of a miniature vending machine and a computer.’

The device is the invention of Brooke Martin, a 9th grader at North Central High School in Spokane, Washington. As well as selling the device, Miss Martin said she also plans to sell her own dog treats

The computer is attached to a motor which is activated when the owner of the device gives it the ‘drop treat’ command from a remote computing device.

A removable sleeve inside the device houses the treats, and one treat is pushed out by the motor arm each time the motor is activated.

Software for the system is also run in the cloud, allowing an owner to log in to a personal account.

According to the iCPooch team, an estimated 13 million dogs suffer from separation anxiety, as well as many pet owners.

The company has launched a Kickstarter campaign, looking to raise $75,000 and has so far received over $7,000 towards its goal.
