Ethan Roberts, one, suffocated to death after getting trapped between his cot and the door while left for 15 minutes without his parents 

A one-year-old boy left at home alone for 15 minutes suffocated to death after getting trapped as he tried to climb out of his cot, an inquest heard today.

Ethan Roberts was found hanging two feet above the ground after his head became stuck between the end of his cot and the door in the family's mobile home in Aldermaston, Berkshire. 

An inquest into his death heard Ethan and his twin brother Mitch had been left alone by their parents while they marshalled a race day at the family-owned racetrack.

The pair were stationed just one minute away from where the mobile home was based, the court was told.

But his mother Ginny only realised what had happened when she heard Mitch crying over the baby monitor she was carrying.

She raced back to the mobile home, where she found Ethan motionless. 

The young boy was given CPR and driven to hospital in an ambulance, but died of catastrophic brain injuries three days later.

He had been due to celebrate his second birthday six days later.

Today, a coroner at West Berkshire Coroner's Court in Newbury recorded a narrative verdict into the young boy's death, describing the incident as a 'tragic accident'.

During the inquest, the court heard the youngster had been put to bed along with his twin brother in the mobile home in July this year.

In a written statement, Mrs Roberts told the court that the young boys, who had been left with their ten-year-old brother Joshua, were less than a minute away from where she was stationed.

She also described how she was carrying an ultra-sensitive baby monitor which was connected to a receiver under Ethan's cot.

The hearing heard how Mrs Roberts usually placed Ethan's cot right up against the door so that the youngsters could not get out if she ever left the mobile home. 

But she said the weather was so hot that the family decided to move the cot slightly further away from the door. She also unlocked the door so a breeze could go into the mobile home.

But, when Mrs Roberts heard crying through the baby monitor, she rushed back to the mobile home.

There, she found Mitch crying while Ethan was found hanging, motionless.

The statement read: 'It must have been about 1pm, I heard crying and screaming through the baby monitor.

'I heard Mitch calling me and he was crying. I saw my bedroom door was open and Mitch was sat there crying. Ethan was there, blue and motionless, between the cot and the door frame.

'Ethan's head was facing down and his neck was on the door frame and his body was hanging over the ledge.

'I think he tried to climb out of his cot the wrong way and has fallen wrong and he's ended with his head and shoulders between the cot and both sides of the door frame and he couldn't move.

An inquest found that the toddler's death in July this year was a 'tragic accident'

'I pushed the cot away and picked him up and legged it. I screamed for help and my brother-in-law came to me and took Ethan across the race track to the paramedics who were on site. I ran across to the ambulance and they were resuscitating Ethan.'

She told the hearing how the twin babies had already overcome adversity just to be alive.

Mitch was born with a heart condition while Ethan had undergone extensive blood sugar level tests in his short life.

As Mrs Roberts fought back tears, Assistant Coroner for Berkshire Emma Jones told her: 'You were a very vigilant mother.

'You took them to the doctor's whenever you had any concerns to do with their health.'

Ethan was rushed first to the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke and then to the specialist paediatric intensive care unit at Southampton General Hospital. He died there on July 16 this year.

The court heard the twins slept in cots in a partitioned off section of their parents' bedroom. They also shared the mobile home with their older brother Joshua and sister Amy, seven.

Members of the family including Ethan's paternal grandparents, Gwen and Colin Roberts, and his aunt and uncle, Christopher and Marianne Roberts, also live and work at the Aldermaston Raceway site. The track hosts up to 20 amateur races a year.

The family wept uncontrollably today as they heard the tragic series of events which led to the youngster's death.

In a statement to the inquest, the boy's father Mitch Roberts said: 'When it all happened I was on the other side of the track. I didn't expect to see what I saw - Ethan being given CPR by the ambulance crew.

'Ginny was in a state she was screaming. Ginny said that when she found Ethan his head was stuck between the door and the cot. He was half in and half out of the door.

'I think that somehow the twins have opened the door and Ethan has tried to get out squeezing through the gap and got his head stuck.'

Grandmother Gwen told the coroner: 'I was stood by the door in race control and I heard this horrific scream, something I will never forget. I saw Ginny running and screaming.'

Her son Malcolm Roberts took Ethan's lifeless body from his mother's arms and rushed him across the racetrack to the waiting ambulance after she rushed out of the mobile home screaming and wailing.

He said: 'I took Ethan off Ginny - he was limp and unresponsive. Ethan wasn't breathing and I began shouting and screaming for Mitch. I was hysterical, I'd done all I could.

Mitch's sister, Kerry Roberts, told the hearing in a statement that she had been helping Joshua look after the boys that morning and put them to bed.

She said: 'I thought about moving the cots further away from the door because I thought "What if they get out of their cots and no one heard them, they would bang their heads." That's the worst I thought would happen so I moved the cots around one foot away from the door.'

She said she heard the screaming later on when Ginny came rushing out with Ethan in her arms.

'Ginny said, "He's dead, he's blue, he's not breathing." From this moment it was bedlam - everywhere I looked there were family members standing looking stunned.'

On site paramedics James Bishop and Neil Morgan, who were overseeing safety at the race day, told the hearing they had performed CPR and mouth to mouth resuscitation on the youngster, whose oxygen supply could have been cut off for more than 10 minutes before he was found.

Mr Bishop said he asked Mr Roberts, who he did not initially know was the youngster's father, to drive the ambulance to nearby Basingstoke Hospital so they could continue their efforts to revive Ethan en route.

Despite doctors being able to get the Ethan's heart running again when he arrived at hospital in Basingstoke, on July 13 this year, a CT scan revealed he had suffered fatal brain damage caused by the oxygen supply to his brain being cut off.

Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said: 'This was a tragic accident caused by Ethan becoming trapped by his neck between his cot and the wall of his home address and dying of asphyxiation.'
