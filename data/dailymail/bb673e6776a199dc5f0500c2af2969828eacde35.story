Swansea and West Ham are considering Hoffenheim striker Anthony Modeste, who wants a return to the Premier League.

The 26-year-old had a brief, unproductive loan spell with Blackburn Rovers in 2012 when the club were on the point of relegation. 

But he moved to Bastia then Hoffenheim and has averaged a goal every two games. Hoffenheim will sell for £5million this month.

Hull and Crystal Palace are also interested.
