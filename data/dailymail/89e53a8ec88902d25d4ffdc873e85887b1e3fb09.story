Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has revealed his surprise at Louis van Gaal's decision to sell Danny Welbeck to Premier League rivals Arsenal.

Manchester United academy graduate Welbeck sealed a £16million move to the Emirates Stadium on deadline day after Van Gaal deemed the England international to be surplus to requirements at Old Trafford.

Queens Park Rangers ace Ferdinand has since questioned Van Gaal's decision to cash in on Welbeck - who he feels was frustrated at Manchester United as Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney were always ahead of him in the pecking order.

Ferdinand, speaking to The Sun on Sunday, said on Welbeck's move to Arsenal: 'I cannot believe United let Danny go, especially to Arsenal. That seems mad to me.

'He's a real threat to defenders and, if Arsenal use him right, he will be very dangerous for them.

'I think he felt frustrated at United because, even if he did well, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney would be ahead of him. I do wonder if they will live to regret not keeping Danny.'

Ferdinand's next game for QPR will see him come up against Manchester United for the first time since ending his 12-year stay at Old Trafford.
