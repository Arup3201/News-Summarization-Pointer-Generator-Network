A US Marine has been held in the Philippines after he was named as a suspect in the murder of a transgender Filipino woman he met in a bar.

He was in the custody of American military officials aboard USS Peleliu in connection with the case, the U.S. Navy Times said.

A police report said the 26-year-old victim, Jeffrey Laude who went by the name Jennifer, was found strangled on Saturday.

US troops had been taking part in a 10-day military exercise with the Philippines.

The 26-year-old victim, Jeffrey Laude who went by the name Jennifer, was found strangled on Saturday 

She was found with her head down a toilet in a hotel room in Olongapo City, the town outside Subic famous for its sleazy bars.

'A U.S. Marine has been identified as a possible suspect in the ongoing investigation,' the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. 'The United States will continue to fully cooperate with Philippine law enforcement authorities in every aspect of the investigation.'

Dindi Tan, of the Association of Transgender People in the Philippines, said: 'The victim must be given justice. The case must not be swept under the rug, especially because the victim is a transgender.' 

Emmi De Jesus, representative for the Gabriela Women's Party, said: 'I condemn the heinous barbarity behind the hate crime committed on the defenseless transgender woman'

Emmi De Jesus, representative for the Gabriela Women's Party, said: 'I condemn the heinous barbarity behind the hate crime committed on the defenseless transgender woman. 

'We maintain that the US military basing in communities worsens prostitution, trafficking, drugs, and spread of diseases.' 

The United States and the Philippines in April signed a new 10-year security pact that allows for a larger U.S. military presence in the country as it struggles to raise its defence capabilities amid territorial disputes with China.

'We are committed to do our part to ensure that justice is served,' Philippine Foreign Ministry spokesman Charles Jose said after being informed about the crime.

In 2005, a U.S. Marine was accused of raping a Filipino woman in Subic Bay. He was convicted by a lower court but an appeals court reversed the ruling after the woman recanted her statement.
