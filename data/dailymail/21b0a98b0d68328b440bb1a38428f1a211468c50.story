A female High Court Judge in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been sacked after she stripped off naked and laid down on her office desk to sunbath.

The scandal was revealed when paperwork detailing a hearing into her actions was leaked to local media.

It revealed that she had been spotted in her office at 8am where she could clearly be seen exercising in the nude, and later she had laid on the table, either to relax or sunbathe.

But the naked judge was photographed by another early riser at the council offices across the road in Sarajevo.

The photograph, which did not name the young woman, was published in local media, where an internal enquiry at the court building revealed her identity, and that she was a senior judge.

The matter ended up with the disciplinary commission of the Supreme Court, and she was fired after it ruled her behaviour had 'damaged the image of the Supreme Court'.

'Her behaviour as a senior judge was not acceptable,' the report added.

The woman said however that her office door had been locked, and she was entitled to exercise as a way of warming up for the day ahead.

She said she had not expected any staff to be in the building opposite at that time.
