A Us postal worker saved the lives of two infants caught in a fire by catching them as their father threw them off the third floor fire escape of a burning Bronx, NY apartment.The two 11-month-old boys, Ishmael and Isreal, landed safely into the arms of third floor resident, mailman Jermaine Shirley, 30, who had managed to escape the fire with his wife and baby. Shirley smelled smoke at 7 a.m. at 870 E.220 St. in Williamsbridge coming from the second floor and knocked on his neighbors doors to warn them of the fire.Shirley heard Everdean Codner, 32, panicking as he stood on the fire escape with his two boys. Codner was stuck in the burning building with his babies and his wife Nikalia.

'I opened up the side windows and I saw a lot of smoke,' Codner told the New York Daily News.

'I tried to make it through the front door but there was nothing but smoke, I couldn't get through it so we went to the back window,' he continued.

Shirley, who delivers mail in Greenwich, Connecticut, was prepared to catch the babies whom Codner quickly dressed in onesies and brought outside.

'I told him, ‘Drop the baby,' Shirley said to the New york Daily News.

Shirley climbed up to an extension of the building so that he could be closer to the children.

'I was ready to catch. One of them, he kind of flipped a little because he was in a full "onesie" suit, but I catch him,' Shirley told the NY Post.

Codner stood on the fire escape and was able to drop his babies down to Shirley who waited below

After Shirley caught one baby safely, Shirley handed the baby to Codner's nephew, Euwan Lynch, 25.

Shirley then caught the other baby and jumped down from the building's extension.

'They dropped the babies down and I catch them. I just thank God that everyone is safe – my wife and kid – everyone is safe. I would want everyone to do the same for me,' Shirley said.

The Codners then jumped down to safety.

'I had to jump from the third floor fire escape, my wife had to jump from like half way down the ladder,' Codner told the New York Daily News.

Codner
 said that fact that he was home to help his family escape the fire was a
 blessing. He was supposed to be at work at the time but he overslept by
 accident.

'I was supposed to be at work when it happened,' Codner said to The New York Daily News. 'God put me here today, not getting to work, for a reason.

Codner called the event, 'more than a miracle.'

Codner is grateful to his neighbor Shirley and his nephew Lynch, who helped saved his young boys.

'I thank Jermaine for saving my babies. Now I have a second chance to be a father to my sons,' said Codner to the NY Post.

'It's the best holiday gift you could ever ask for,' Codner said.
