A five-year-old has released his inner anger by beating up a huge stuffed Mickey Mouse toy... in a bid to release the sweets stored inside.

The hilarious footage shows the youngster furiously beating the toy, which is suspended from a line, with a multi-coloured stick.

Adults watching the spectacle are shown in fits of laughter as one woman cries: ‘Stop making him mad. Where is all this rage coming from?’

The funny video has become an internet hit, after being watched nearly 40,000 times on YouTube in just five days.

The young boy is taking part in the Mexican tradition of breaking open a piñata to release sweets stored inside.

And most children opt to use the decorated stick they are given to crack open the toy.

However, this raging five-year -old tosses the stick to one side and opts for fist power as he punches the ever-smiling Mickey.

Unfortunately for him, despite resorting to pummelling the Mickey Mouse container, he cannot break the piñata and the game is fruitless.

The youngster resorts to pummeling the Mickey Mouse pinata with his fists as part of the Mexican  celebration

The traditional Catholic interpretation of the piñata is based on the struggle of man against temptation.

The participant beats the sweet-filled piñata which represents evil, symbolising the struggle against temptation.

When the toy breaks, the treats inside show the rewards of keeping the faith.
