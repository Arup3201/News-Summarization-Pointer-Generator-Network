As George Osborne delivered his ‘giveaway’ budget today, it wasn't just his generous economic measures that got people talking.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer appeared to be in the final stages of an image overhaul, adding the finishing touches to his new slimline figure and modern haircut with a trendy suit.

And as he stepped out of Number 11 Downing Street this morning, he was snapped with what appeared to be a face of makeup.

Mr Osborne's suit divided opinion on Twitter today for being ill-fitting

Mr Osborne’s new look is a far cry from his appearance when he first took up the government post in 2010, when he was significantly heavier, with a middle-aged haircut and a frumpy style.

However, thanks to a lifestyle makeover – which included lots of jogging and fasting twice a week on the 5:2 diet – the Chancellor today cut a trimmer figure.

The 43-year-old's new haircut was also compared to Hollywood movie star Antonio Banderas’s in his early days, with a miniature wispy fringe edged over his forehead.

But it was Mr Osborne's new suit that really drew reaction, with comments flooding on social media.

Mr Osborne's new look echoed that of Hollywood actor Antonio Banderas 

Mr Osborne was wearing a thick layer of make-up to present the budget 

Critics called the ensemble a strange cut – and said it appeared too large around the shoulders and too short in the length of the trousers.

It also featured large stitching around the lapels that gave it a childlike quality.

But it was the decision to go for the old-fashioned, three-button suit that really got people talking on Twitter.

Jack Harvard Taylor posted: 'Not a fan of George Osborne's suit - strange cut.'

While Jon Pace tweeted: 'My old boss was on Jury Service and was convinced a man was guilty on the basis he was wearing a suit like George Osbourne's!'

And Kenny Farquharson added: 'Osborne controversially going for three-button suit, against gentlemen's outfitters orthodoxy.'

Twitter was awash with comments about George Osborne's suit today 

MailOnline fashion expert Simon Glazin said: 'He may be delivering the budget, but I didn't realise George Osbourne was shopping on a budget.

'This suit screams cheap to me. You can tell by the strange stitching and the high-cut, sloppy lapels. Also a big give away is the wrinkling material.

'It definitely looks budget to me. And a three-button jacket is a very old school, strange choice.

'Maybe his expensive suits were all at the dry cleaners.

'Bad timing, and bad choice, for one of his biggest and most-covered speeches in the Commons.'

Fortunately for Mr Osborne, the suit took the attention away from the fact that his face was seemingly covered in a thick layer of foundation.

Despite a few setbacks, the Chancellor's style transformation has been a vast improvement on his original look of five years ago. 

The style overhaul has been thanks to one of his senior government aides, Thea Rogers, who used to work as a producer for BBC political editor Nick Robinson before Mr Osborne hired her to manage his image.

As well as his new look, she has also been responsible for the increase in appearances at places like building sites to make him appear more down to earth.

Ms Rogers was responsible for his new haircut and also for putting him on the 5:2 diet, which saw him slim down dramatically over the course of a year.  

The diet requires Mr Osborne to limit his intake to 600 calories two days a week and eat normally on the other five. 

It has been reported that the new look has been tailored to give him the best possible chance of  succeeding David Cameron as Prime Minister when the time comes.
