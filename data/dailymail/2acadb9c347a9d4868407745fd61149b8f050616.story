A third of cereal is eaten for meals other than breakfast, only five per cent of Americans have three square meals a day and Dunkin’ Donuts is shifting masses of chicken salad sandwiches before 9am.

The U.S. food industry is adapting to huge changes in the eating habits of Americans, with two in five snacking more than once every day and several thousand McDonald’s opening for 24 hours a day.

One in five of all cookies and apple pies sold by the fast food chain are at breakfast and other food outlets are launching innovative ideas such as French toast ice cream and the Maple Bacon sundae.

Changing trends: Kellogg’s is targeting Special K Chocolatey Delight cereals as a snack for after dinner and Dunkin’ Donuts is shifting masses of chicken salad sandwiches before 9am

‘I don't think my kids have eaten a real meal since last Thanksgiving,’ Stan Frankenthaler, of Dunkin' Brands - which owns fast food chain Dunkin' and ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins - told USA Today.

The University of California, Berkeley, is finding less than three in 10 students are on its 'all-you-can-eat' meal plan, which is around half the proportion just a decade ago, reported the newspaper.

‘Eating weird is the new normal,’ Shawn LaPean, of the college’s Cal Dining service, said. ‘If students eat any square meals per day it might be one. The rest is filled with snacks and food on the go.’

The three biggest trends USA Today found is that Americans are eating what they want when they want, skip meals without a second thought and want food tailor-made to their exact preferences.

McDonald’s, a chain synonymous with American over-indulgence but also product innovation, is launching a popcorn-size chicken snack called McBites next year after a trial in Washington D.C.

Its restaurants are finding one in five customers buy their cookies and apple pies for breakfast and more than 20 per cent of their oatmeal portions are sold at meal times other than breakfast.

McDonald’s offers more than a dozen sauces to allow customers to have exactly the flavour they desire - especially on McNuggets, which many want to taste like chicken wings, reported USA Today.

Meanwhile Kellogg’s is targeting Special K Chocolatey Delight and Rice Krispies cereals as snacks for after dinner, and Stonyfield is finding 20 per cent of buyers eat yoghurt in place of an evening meal.

Trends expert Nancy Kruse told USA Today deserts are often eaten before breakfast, lunch and dinner are being merged into ‘linner’ and breakfast and dinner are coming together for ‘brinner’.

USA Today picked the case study of 
California student Ashwin Aravind, 20, who eats a muffin and Tater Tots 
for breakfast at 10am, a rice bowl at 2pm and McDonald’s cookies with 
fries at 3pm.

He will not eat dinner until 11pm when he has pizza and a bowl of rice later. ‘Most of my friends skip breakfast altogether,’ he told USA Today.

The investigation into odd eating habits will prompt accusations this is encouraging the U.S. obesity problem. A study in August found 15 per cent of households say they cannot afford nutritious food.

One in four people in 36 states are seriously overweight. In stark contrast, no state had an obesity rate above 25 per cent in 2000. The issue is something IHOP’s Cup O' Pancakes will not be helping.
