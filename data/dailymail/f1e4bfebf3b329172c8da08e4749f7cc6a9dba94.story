A council candidate's campaign poster - which urges residents to 'vote for the black guy' - has sparked a race debate within an Adelaide community.

African-born Nkweto Nkamba is vying to be the representative for the Parks ward on the Port Adelaide-Enfield council - in Adelaide's north-west - and wanted a way to stand out from the crowd.

Against the advice of friends who thought 'it wasn't a good idea', Mr Nkamba - also known as NK - went ahead with the idea of using the memorable slogan.

But he was adamant the posters were not racially motivated and so far it had attracted a good response.

'I think it's an education [for] society of what racist is,' he told ABC Radio.

'I'm actually coming out in a humble way, I'm an easy-going guy, if you like me, vote for me.' 

The posters have earned him so much recognition that strangers have even started stopping him on the street, with some asking him to pose in photos with them.

His poster has sparked a debate in the community, with some asking if it was politically correct

'This guy comes out of his house, I don't even know him, and he's like, "Hey, it's the black guy",' Mr Nkamba told 7News with a laugh.

Supporters have also taken to the 32-year-old's Facebook page to voice their amusement at the tongue-in-cheek campaign.

'I love the humour, a light way to look at serious issues,' Eugenia Torrealba wrote.

Julie Pearce said: 'If you were in my area NK I'd vote for ya, but then I think you already know that.' 

But some residents have questioned whether or not the posters were politically correct.

'The world you live in now, you can't say "black" anymore, can you? Can you still say that?' one voter told 7News.

But Mr Nkamba said the response has been generally positive within the Port Adelaide-Enfield community

Mr Nkamba - who works an accountant - said he had moved to Australia to fulfil his long-desired dream to study overseas.

'I learnt of this beautiful place and it's the best decision I ever made. I feel really appreciated and loved in this country,' he told ABC Radio

In his candidate profile, Mr Nkamba said he aimed to install more CCTV camera, stop hooning and illegal dumping as well as keep up the maintenance of public places and streets. 

'Once the appearance of our neighbourhood is degraded, it's an invitation to crime,' he wrote.

'By this voluntary service, I want to show my gratitude to Australia for taking me in as a migrant... and [I] think our area has huge potential if sensibly managed by people who care for it.'

Voting for South Australia's local government election will be done by post and closes in November.
