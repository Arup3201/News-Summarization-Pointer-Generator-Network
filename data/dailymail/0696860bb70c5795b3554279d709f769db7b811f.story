Chelsea inflicted Maribor's first defeat in nine Champions League games this season with a show of strength at Stamford Bridge.

Didier Drogba scored his first goal since his return to the club from the penalty spot after Loic Remy's opener. John Terry added a second before the break before a Mitja Viler own goal and two strikes from Eden Hazard put the icing on a big win.

The only bad mark on the night for the Blues was an injury to Remy - likely leaving veteran Drogba to start against Manchester United on Sunday with Diego Costa also suffering from injury.

CHELSEA (4-2-3-1)

Petr Cech - 6.5

Had little to do on his return to action in place of Thibaut Courtois. Went the right way for Agim Ibraimi's penalty but could only watch as it rebounded away off the post.

Branislav Ivanovic - 6.5

Got forward as usual and won the penalty for the first of Hazard's double.

Kurt Zouma - 6.5

A simple start to his Champions League career. Zouma dealt well with what was thrown at him, particularly in the air, but bigger tests are to come.

John Terry - 7

Untroubled at the back so was free to play his part at the other end. An assist was followed by a goal as he galloped up-field to knock in Cesc Fabregas' cut-back.

Filipe Luis - 7

With Maribor fielding two full-backs down the right flank, Luis had plenty of chance to get forward. Did brilliantly to evade a challenge and cross for the Viler own goal.

Cesc Fabregas - 7

A class act again in midfield - linked up brilliantly with Hazard especially for Terry's goal. Another assist in blue.

Nemanja Matic - 7

Provided a solid base but gave away a penalty before Viler hit the post.

Willian - 7

Mourinho has asked him to improve his end product. Came close by hitting the bar and was constantly a danger.

Oscar - 7

Looked dangerous again after an impressive performance at Crystal Palace but no goal this time.

Eden Hazard - 8

Two late goals capped an impressive performance - Hazard was everywhere and Maribor struggled to get to grips with him.

Loic Remy- 7

Good effort for the goal but pulled up lame and now likely to miss trip to Old Trafford.

SUBSTITUTES

Didier Drogba - (for Remy, 16 mins) 6.5

Emotional moment with his first goal back at Chelsea but still not quite the presence he once was.

Nathan Ake - (for Fabregas, 60 mins) 6

Replaced Fabregas in midfield and looked confident. Good pass for Hazard's second.

Dominic Solanke came on as a substitute for Oscar to make his debut on 73 minutes

Made some smart runs but not enough time to make an impact.

Gave the kids a chance and will now look forward to a tough trip to Old Trafford.
