Ashley is sick of women being made to feel guilty for having a  baby 'too late'

At some point in the past few years, for me at least, Fertility has really become the F word.

It's a notion that inspires guilt and regret in those of us over 40 as we are pummelled daily in the press for 'leaving it too late' and panic for those in their 20's and 30's, regularly admonished to forgoe both financial and emotional security in order to have babies immediately, in particular by successful, insanely wealthy television presenters who did nothing of the sort.

For women in the thick of it, it's getting to be rather ugly. 

Regularly patronised by (predominantly male) doctors and lectured by smug married, financially well off mothers who offer unsolicited advice – fertility just isn't fun anymore.

Additionally, I think the words that most of us associate with fertility with are other F words, like failure or fear. 

The failure to establish a stable relationship with a man who also wants children in his early 30's (which by the way is almost none of them) or the failure of your body to do what you always believed it could do.

As a first time mother at 40, I understand these feelings all too well. 

Having your fertility tested, prodded, talked about and analysed at the same moment you are passionate about having a baby is utterly terrifying, no matter what your age or challenges. 

As an older woman who wants to get pregnant it is especially unpleasant. You are often made to feel as if you did something wrong. You know what? 

You didn't. Life and opportunities happen the way that they do for some of us and some things are simply out of our control. That is, if you believe in creating a child with someone you love, who is stable and emotionally involved, which I did. 

As I headed like an unstoppable bullet train towards 40, fertility became the word I most dreaded reading in newspaper headlines, most of which were heralding yet another new study outlining yet again how the odds were stacked against me.

The sad truth of the matter though, as it is with most unpleasant realities, these things can't really be avoided; they exist whether we like them or not. 

And whilst It's undeniable that there is a lot of fear surrounding this word 'fertility', waiting to develop courage to tackle it is just another form of procrastination. 

As someone once said, the most successful people take action while they're still afraid.

Next week is National Fertility Week aiming to help couples who are trying to get pregnant 

And so, if you're like me, National Fertility Week, kicking off October 27-November 2nd is something you approach in equal parts scepticism and trepidation.

From what I can gather, the thinking behind it is well intentioned. It's a week-long endeavour offering both men and women information geared to help increase understanding of fertility issues, which affect one in six couples in the UK. 

Susan Seenan, Chief Executive of the Infertility Network UK, says, 'Almost everyone will know someone who has experienced difficulties conceiving, which hopefully will encourage people to support the week.'

There are some good resources available, if you know where to look. It's not all hype and it's not all bad news. And so, if you are someone for whom the word fertility has taken on a particularly unpleasant connotation, perhaps it's time to gently nudge yourself back into the conversation.

Three of the UK's top female fertility experts are getting involved. And their voices are worth listening to.

For the first time ever, mini-clinics will be offered free of charge to the public, giving women and men the chance to ask questions and gain insight into fertility options

During the week, the UK's leading fertility expert and 'Eat Yourself Pregnant' author Zita West is taking questions and offering advice at Crussh, Fit Food & Juice Bar locations all around London. 

For the first time ever, mini-clinics will be offered free of charge to the public, giving women and men the chance to ask questions and gain insight into fertility options. 

These mini-clinics will cover all aspects of fertility: including the role of nutrition, fertility MOTs and IVF information, as well as prepping for IVF. 

In honour of the event, Crussh will be designing a Zita West 'fertility juice', (from 'Eat Yourself Pregnant') and 50p from the sale of every Deep Cleanse Green Juice will go to the Infertility Network, the UK's leading infertility support network. To get dates and times contact ZitaWest.com or crussh.com

Zita says, 'My aim is to bring fertility awareness to the high street through consultation, in an environment where women and men can have their questions answered by me and my team of experts.' Zita's clinic, under the leadership of the renowned fertility expert Dr George Ndukwe has one of the highest IVF success rates in the world, if that is bit of a push.

Launching October 31st, The Baby-Making Bible author Emma Cannon's new e-book, 'Fertility to Family.' Emma says, 'A major part of what I do as a practitioner is to support couples through fertility treatment; giving the patient some fine-tuning with acupuncture, helping the body and helping to create a calm mind. 

'I know that food and thought are two of the core pillars that underpin a foundation for health. The process of going through IVF provides it own challenges and there is much you can do to support that process through preparation and during IVF treatment itself.' 

Emma outlines a healthy eating plan that assists with natural conception as well as a week by week diet for those going through the IVF process, available from October 31 on Amazon.

Champneys in Tring is doing a fertility retreat with fertility specialist Dr Marilyn Glenville. The author and expert will offer those attending the 21-23 November course information on how to improve their chances of getting pregnant naturally. 

Marilyn, who wrote the best-selling Getting Pregnant Faster says: 'I see so many couples in my clinics struggling to conceive, it's always satisfying to help individuals better understand their bodies and what factors can affect their fertility, ensuring they are in the best possible shape to conceive.'

Whether we like it or not questions and issues surrounding fertility are here to stay. The announcement this week that some companies are going to pay for female employees to freeze their eggs merely proves that these conversations are just beginning.

When asked about overcoming fears on the road to finding success, Bill Cosby once said, 'Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it.'

That's what I'll be doing during National Fertility Week anyway.
