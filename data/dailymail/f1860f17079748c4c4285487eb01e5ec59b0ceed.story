Wellwishers cheering the Queen were startled when a soldier she’d just spoken to suddenly sat down in the road.

Many thought he’d collapsed with heat exhaustion during the royal tour of Kendal, Cumbria.

But Her Majesty knew exactly what was going on and didn’t bat an eyelid.

Sitting: Sgt Rusiate Bolavucu sat on the ground as a mark of respect for the Queen as she visited Kendal, Cumbria

The monarch understood what the crowds didn’t - that it was Fijian mark of respect for royalty.

Sgt Rusiate Bolavucu, 32, representing the Burma Company, part of the 1st Battalion Duke of Lancaster Regiment, was following an ancient tradition from his South Pacific homeland.

He said: 'It is a traditional and cultural thing for people from Fiji to do when they meet a head of state. It is a way of showing respect.

'The Queen has been to Fiji so she knows about it, and she had asked me where I was from, so she smiled when she saw what I was doing.'

It is very important to show respect to one’s elders or to those in authority in Fijian culture.

This is done through a variety of actions taking into account body posture and position, clothing and gestures.

In Fijian culture it is thought that good things come through the head and are passed down to the feet. It is important to make sure that one’s head is not above others in the room.

Respect: The soldier raised his cap as the monarch passed him, a tradition common in Fiji

Men sit cross legged as it is rude to draw one’s knees up to the chest.

He was among other solders from the 
1st Battalion, who had just returned from Afghanistan, and those from 
4th Battalion the Duke of Lancaster Regiment, who all managed to say a 
few words to the Queen.

Thousands
 came out in the sunshine to catch a glimpse of Her Majesty and Princess Anne, as they stopped at Kendal, Burneside, Bowness and 
Windermere.

Oxenholme station was packed with well wishers as the duo pulled up in the Diamond Jubilee Royal train, before heading to Kendal town centre where ten-deep crowds waited in anticipation. 

The atmosphere buzzed with remarks of admiration as the pair chatted to dignitaries, cadets, members of the Royal British Legion and soldiers.

Councillor for Kendal Parks, Phillip Walker, also got to talk to Her Majesty, and he made sure she did not leave without a bar of the famous Mint Cake. 

Mr Walker, who had been in the town centre at 8am to make sure he got a glance of the Royals, said: 'I gave the Queen some of Romney’s chocolate covered mint cake.

Unusual: He stands after the Queen passes him. The monarch was not fazed as she knew that it was an act of respect

'She thanked me for it and I said 
thank you for visiting Kendal. She seemed really friendly and smiley and
 it was so exciting to see her, and the Princess Royal, in my home 
town.'

Mint Cake was not the only foodie treat that the visitors left with, as both were given a hamper of goods from Made in Cumbria. 

And the Queen seemed pleased to receive one product in particular.

Retail manager Tracey Graham, who presented the hampers, said: 'She said that she was definitely going to keep the damson gin for herself! 

'Princess Anne was also thrilled with the gift and said that she hoped the Mint Cake we included would see her through the day.'

After receiving posies from Kendal school pupils, Amelia Nicholl and Harry Coward, the Queen, who was wearing a green and blue floral dress with a plain green coat, and her only daughter headed to Burneside. 

There they gave the Royal seal of approval to a new multi-million pound plant at specialist paper makers James Cropper.

Her Majesty and the Princess Royal 
were given an insight into the business’ daily operations and met young 
apprentices before unveiling a plaque to open the new £5m recycling 
plant. 

'They were both really interested in what we were doing and asked lots of questions,' said Mark Starrs, a colour co-ordinator. 

'I was put at ease very quickly.'

The Royal Party then travelled to Bowness, where they were greeted with flags, bunting and a very excited crowd. 

Those
 assembled clamoured for the chance to speak to Her Majesty, who was 
presented with gifts and posies, before setting out on old-fashioned 
steamer, MV Teal.

Her Stewart Parvin outfit was complemented by the sparkling waters of Windermere on the 15-minute sail, which took her to the Lake District Visitor Centre at Brockhole.

There, she met several local 
dignitaries and told schoolchildren she hoped Prince William and the 
Duchess of Cambridge’s baby would be born ‘soon’. 

The visitors did not go home hungry after lunch at Miller Howe Hotel, Windermere. 

On
 the menu was local smoked salmon with Morecambe Bay potted shrimps, 
Cumbrian spring lamb and for dessert, raspberry and lemon tart.

Manager Nigel Williamson said: 'We had cheated a little because we looked up online what the Queen did and did not like, and found that lamb was her favourite. 

'But they both seemed to enjoy all of the dishes, and spoke to all the staff afterwards. It was such an honour.'

After a day packed with smiles and laughter, mother and daughter embraced before making separate journeys home.

Smiles: The Queen met the players before start of play of the second Ashes test match between England and Australia

Hand shaking: Queen Elizabeth II was introduced to all of the players in both teams before the game began

Respect: The Queen shakes hands with England's Kevin Pietersen at Lord's Cricket Ground, London

Her Majesty once again boarded the Royal train and waved goodbye to station staff, police and members of the public, while the Princess was ushered into an escort car and driven away. 

England and Australia's cricketers were also all smiles as they met the Queen before going head-to-head in another eagerly anticipated Ashes Test match.

The monarch walked out on to the famous pitch at Lord's cricket ground to meet the batsmen and bowlers who were lined up ahead of the day's play.

The famous ground is the home of cricket and is owned by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game.

Delighted: Members of both teams were seen to be ecstatic to have met Her Majesty

Greeting: Queen Elizabeth II is introduced to the Australian team by captain Michael Clarke

Privilege: Queen Elizabeth II meets MCC members inside the Committee Room of the Pavilion at Lord's Cricket Ground

It will celebrate its bicentenary next year after being established by cricketer and businessman Thomas Lord in 1814.

As the last of the sell-out crowds took their seats for the second Test, England captain Alistair Cook introduced the Queen to his players.

Among the team were the leading performers of the first Test at Trent Bridge which England won - bowler Jimmy Anderson, who took the last wicket in a nailbiting finish, and batsman Ian Bell, who scored a century.

As much as the Queen will have enjoyed the respect shown by the Fijian soldier yesterday, there have sadly been several other occasions where royal protocol have been ignored by those meeting her.

In 2011, then Australian prime minister Julia Gillard was accused of disrespect over her failure to curtsey to the Queen.

A rule concerning the sovereign has also been set in stone for generations:
 'Whatever you do, don't touch the Queen,' courtiers often warn.

But during
 a G20 reception at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Michelle Obama put her 
hand around the Queen for about 10 seconds (below).

Finding 
herself next to Mrs Obama, the Queen had remarked on their height 
difference. As she did so, her hand edged towards the small of Mrs 
Obama's back. Mrs Obama responded - and even rubbed the Queen's shoulder
 - before both women moved gently apart.

In 
May 2011, during the Queen's first official visit to the Republic of Ireland,
 Irish president Mary McAleese, like Miss Gillard, greeted the Queen 
with a simple handshake.

Miss Gillard, however, is not even the first  Australian prime minister to have breached royal protocol.

In
 1992 Paul Keating (right) was given the nickname of 'Lizard of Oz' after he 
touched the Queen's lower back with his arm as he guided her through a 
crowd of people.

In 2000 another Australian premier, John Howard, denied touching the monarch as he introduced her to MPs at a VIP reception

In 2010, while visiting Canada, racehorse owner Don Romeo put his hand on 
her back as she handed a trophy to the owner of the winning horse at the
 Queen's Plate Stakes in Toronto.

His 
breach of protocol was swiftly corrected, however, when his 
Jockey, Eurico Da Silva, executed two bows so low that his head was 
level with the Queen's waist (below)

So how should one behave?

There 
are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen or members 
of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe tradition.

For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women execute a small 
curtsey.

For those who prefer, it is in fact perfectly acceptable simply to shake hands.

On 
presentation to the Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' 
and subsequently 'Ma'am'. For male royals the same rules apply, with the
 
title used in the first instance being 'Your Royal Highness' and 
subsequently 'Sir'.

For other female members of the Royal Family the first address is 
conventionally 'Your Royal Highness' followed by 'Ma'am'.
