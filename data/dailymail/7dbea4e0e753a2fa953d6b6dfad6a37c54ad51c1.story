Two British soldiers are believed to have committed suicide in Afghanistan yesterday, taking the number of British fatalities for the week to four.

The names of the servicemen have yet to be released by the Ministry of Defence, but next of kin have been informed.

One of the men was from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers based at Camp Bastion, the UK headquarters in Helmand province.

Prince Harry is based at the UK headquarters in Afghanistan, where a soldier died from a suspected suicide

A second serviceman is thought to have shot himself a few miles away from the base.

Defence sources say an investigation has been launched into the suspected Camp Bastion suicide, the camp at which Prince Harry is based - it is not thought to be the result of hostile action.

The Ministry of Defence said the 
soldier was a member of 104 Force Support Battalion and was attached to 4
 Close Support Battalion, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers 
(REME).

Lieutenant Colonel 
Richard Parry, spokesman for Joint Force Support (Afghanistan), said: 
‘It is with deep sadness that I must report the death of a soldier from 4
 Close Support Battalion, REME, at Camp Bastion, Helmand Province.

‘The
 condolences of all personnel serving with Joint Force Support 
(Afghanistan) are with the soldier’s family and friends at this 
extremely difficult time.’

Hours after his death was announced the MoD also announced the 
death of a soldier from 28 Engineer Regiment, attached to 21 Engineer 
Regiment at Forward Operating Base Shawqat, Helmand province.

A spokesman said: 'The soldier was 
involved in a shooting incident at a forward operating base in the 
district of Nad-e Ali. A full investigation is ongoing and the 
circumstances are not being treated as a hostile action.'

Spokesman for Task Force Helmand, 
Major Laurence Roche, said: 'I am very sorry to report the death of a 
soldier serving with 21 Engineer Regiment who was involved in a shooting incident at Forward Operating Base Shawqat this morning.

'This is a tragic day for everyone 
serving with Task Force Helmand in Afghanistan as we mourn this sad loss
 of life. Our thoughts are with the soldier's family and friends during 
their time of grief and loss.'

The deaths bring the total number 
of members of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan 
began in October 2001 to 432.

They follow the murder of father
 of two Sergeant Gareth Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, of 3 
Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington’s).

Prime Minister David Cameron has visited British soldiers at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, where the soldier is suspected to have committed suicide

The men
 were shot at a checkpoint in the south of Nahr-e Saraj district in 
Helmand when a man dressed as an Afghan policeman feigned injury so they
 would help him.

When they 
approached he opened fire with an automatic weapon. Their deaths are the
 latest to result from a so-called ‘green on blue’ incident in which 
supposedly friendly Afghans turn on allied troops.

Last Friday, Lance Corporal Duane Groom, 32, of 1 Battalion Grenadier Guards, was killed by a roadside bomb in Nahr-e Saraj.

A total of 51 coalition soldiers have died in such incidents this year, including nine British servicemen.
