These beautiful images may look like something from an alien world - but they were actually created using a special type of infrared film, which one photographer has started stockpiling due to its increased rarity.

Sean Lynch, from New York, began experimenting with infrared photography when he was in South Asia, five years ago.

Having originally shot infrared images through digital camera, Sean decided to try and take similar shots with infrared film rolls, which he said was a far more difficult task.

With most people now using digital cameras, the likes of Kodak discontinued their infrared film range around six years ago.

Infrared film is extremely tricky to 
work with, as there is very little latitude between highlights and 
shadows before images become over exposed.

Humans see what's known as 'visible light' - a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be seen by the eye.

Beyond
 this range there are other waves that are not visible to humans - 
infrared film is engineered to be responsive not only to what humans can
 see, but also what cannot be seen, capturing infrared rays from certain
 materials, such as foliage.

Intensity: The use of rare infrared Kodak film enables the photographer to produce images, such of this in Central Park, New York, which appear more like paintings

Colourful: Few visitors, of the human kind, will have seen these shades of colours during a walk through Central Park in New York

Mr Lynch said: 'The thing I find most 
fascinating about infrared photography is its ability to transform 
something real to something surreal, without looking altered.

'I can't tell you how many people have asked me, 'Was it really that red?'

'Getting
 the perfect shot with infrared film requires a bit of trial and error -
 taking a series of shots at various exposure settings in the hope that 
one of them gets it right, as, since it's film, you can't immediately 
see if you were on the spot with your settings.

'With many infrared films now 
discontinued, to the dislike of my wife, my entire freezer is filled 
with hard to find Kodak films, most notably Kodak EIR, Kodak HIE, and 
Kodak Ektachrome.

'I have 
seen prices range up to $150 for a roll on the web. The issue is not so 
much the price - although steep - but the availability, as infrared 
films were gobbled up and stockpiled upon word of discontinuation.

Testing: Using infrared film presents the photographer will the added difficulty of trying to judge the amount of exposure when viewing contrasted landscapes such as this view over a lake in Central Park, New York
