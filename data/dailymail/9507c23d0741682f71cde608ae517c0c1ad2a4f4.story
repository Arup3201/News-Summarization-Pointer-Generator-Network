A bitter memory of her father being stopped by police and her own brushes with cops rushed back to  Daniele Watts when the actress ended up in cuffs over refusing to hand an officer her ID

The Django Unchained star wrote Saturday in an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel how a memory of her father being stopped without cause made her unwilling to cooperate with police responding to a 'lewd behavior' call in Los Angeles.

'When I was 16, my father was driving me home from a school play when we saw flashing lights,' Watts explained. 'We hadn't been speeding. I remember my father asking the police officer what was wrong. The officer ignored his question and demanded identification.' 

Refused: Daniele Watts was not allowed to leave the scene when officers were called to respond to a charge of 'lewd behavior,' where she refused to give ID

The officer did not explain why he had pulled them over. Instead he asked Watts's father questions such as 'Who is she?' while adding a disparaging remark about Watts's costume.

Watts explains her father felt he 'was powerless to stop the questioning or protect me from the officer's judgments,' but still handed over his license to avoid the officer making 'life very hard.'

So when Los Angeles police approached Watts and her partner Brian Lucas - who is white - earlier this month following a call of 'lewd behavior,' she recalled that memory, she said.

She refused to turn over ID to officers after being spotted in a car with Lucas, when she said that the couple was just kissing, though TMZ claimed photos were of something more extracurricular.

An audio recording obtained by MailOnline caught audio of when police walked up to Watts to demand identification.

'It is a constitutional right that we do not have to present ID to any member of law enforcement unless we are being charged with a crime,' she's heard saying.

Tape: Watts spoke of having police called on her and her partner Brian Lucas because of their races, which brought on a backlash when tape and photos of the incident surfaced

Star: Watts played the role of Coco in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, and she's had roles in shows like Californication

She later walks away from the scene and is detained in handcuffs, in spite of officers not charging her.

Watts claimed that the officers grilled her about her relationship with Lucas and made her feel like a prostitute.  

The audio led many to criticize Watts for 'crying wolf' over racial profiling when it emerged that she is the first to mention race during the interaction with police. 

In her op-ed, she says that when she said 'Do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black?' she thought of three recent episodes that echoed the one with her father.

During a stop for speeding in Texas, Watts says an officer removed her from the car and interrogated her about how she and Lucas knew each other and why they were traveling together.

In California, she watched a police car pass by her and Lucas talking in a parked car, then double back with lights flashing to check out a call of 'suspicious persons' due to a 'flurry of robberies.'

Another time Watts says she and Lucas were sorting through his father's garage and were stopped on 'concerns about robbery,' when Watts says she adamantly refused to provide ID.

The Daily News reported the officers involved are the subject of a probe by the LAPD for charges including biased policing and conduct unbecoming, though there are no official allegations.

As for Watts, she says she couldn't have 'turned my back on the 16-year-old who watched her father' embarrassed by police by turning over ID when she says she had the right not to.
