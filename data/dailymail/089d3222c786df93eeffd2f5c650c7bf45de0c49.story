One of Germany's most famous fortune tellers is fighting for her life in intensive care after being stabbed repeatedly by a man unhappy with her advice.

The fortune teller Zagorka Jovanovic, 68, who advertises on white magic websites as Esmeralda aus Bilk, charged hundreds of euros for a sitting in which she claimed to use the spiritual world to settle relationship disputes.

But she was stabbed outside her flat in Dusseldorf, a city in western Germany, by Turkish man Metin Kolkilic, after advising his lover to leave him.

Zagorka Jovanovic, 68, who goes by the name of Esmeralda aus Bilk, is fighting for her life in hospital after being repeatedly stabbed on her doorstep by a man unhappy with one of her readings

According to police 43-year-old Kolkilic had started a relationship with a local woman after she had walked out on her previous partner.

Police are hunting for 43-year-old Metin Kolkilic, who is believed to have attacked Jovanovic after she told his lover to leave him

Knowing that she was superstitious, her ex persuaded the woman to visit Esmeralda. She advised the pair to get back together if the young woman wanted to have a happy future.

As a result she walked out on Kolkilic and returned to her previous lover.

Kolkilic flew into a rage when his lover told him she was leaving him because of the psychic.

He went to see the fortune teller himself, and after she opened the door he stabbed her repeatedly before running off.

The fortune teller's husband, who heard her screaming from the hallway, said she was already lying on the floor in a pool of blood with no sign of her attacker by the time he found her.

He called an ambulance and medics say it was only thanks to a speedy emergency operation that she is alive.

Kolkilic has gone on the run. Police officers are still looking for him and believe he may have fled back to Turkey.

The fortune teller became famous in Dusseldorf after she signed up a number of prominent clients including the local mayor Joachim Erwin.
