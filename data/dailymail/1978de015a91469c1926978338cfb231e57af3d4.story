A British woman is fighting for her life after falling 80ft from the balcony of her holiday hotel room in Majorca.

Chantelle Serginson, 24, plunged from the sixth floor after a row with her mother Kimberley, according to police sources.

She suffered multiple head and leg fractures and last night was in a critical condition in hospital.

The life-threatening accident is the latest devastating event to strike a family plagued with tragedy.

It comes six years after Kimberley had her throat slashed in front of her daughter during an horrific knife attack at her home and almost 13 years since she lost a seven-year-old daughter Katie to a brain tumour in 1999.

Chantelle, from Middlesbrough, was on holiday in the party resort of Magaluf with her mother and sister Jessica, 15, when this latest incident happened at the three-star Hotel Marina Barracuda at about 6pm on Friday.

A source at the Civil Guard police said: ‘We are treating this as a tragic accident.

‘Witnesses have  told us that Chantelle was rowing with  her mother in  the hotel room.

‘She went out on to the balcony and for some reason climbed up on the railing.

‘We believe she lost her balance and fell, landing on a first floor balcony below. We do not believe that she threw herself off intentionally.’

Three Britons have fallen to their deaths from hotels in Magaluf in the past six weeks.

In 2006 Kimberley, 44 today, had her throat cut by neighbour Mark Smorthwaite.

He was jailed indefinitely for wounding with intent.

Speaking after the sentencing, the hairdresser, who was 38 at the time, spoke of the devastation the attack had caused the family.

‘Me and my daughter were watching the television and saw someone getting their throat cut. Even though you know it's fictional I felt sick to my stomach because you know what it really feels like.

‘I have flashbacks and dreams. Sometimes it's not even him doing it. You just hope that in time they will go away,’ she told the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette.

During the trial Teesside jury were told how Smorthwaite, who lived over the road from Mrs Serginson in Park End, had stormed over ‘fuming with anger’, brandishing a knife and sliced the blade across her neck.

Mrs Serginson required extensive plastic surgery to allow the deep wound to heal.
