Alan Pardew wants to take the Crystal Palace team for the first time in their the New Year’s Day fixture at Aston Villa.

Although Pardew is unlikely to take the Palace squad for Wednesday’s training session, he has intimated that he wants to be in the thick of it at Villa Park on Thursday.

Newcastle are still waiting for Palace to finalise their package with Pardew before announcing the former Eagles midfielder as their new manager. Palace are likely to go public on Wednesday.

With Palace involved in a battle against relegation from the Barclays Premier League, Pardew wants to lead the team out for the first time at Villa Park.

Ironically his first game as Palace manager is also the same stadium where Pardew scored the winner for the Eagles in their 1990 FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool.

Pardew was at Newcastle United’s training ground on Tuesday where he said goodbye to his players and staff.

The 53-year-old arrived via the club’s academy to avoid photographers and camera crews at the entrance to the first-team headquarters.

Newcastle’s reserves were playing a behind-closed-doors friendly with Gateshead and Pardew – wearing a hoodie – shook hands with Peter Beardsley’s side, which included Jonas Gutierrez, before returning across the training pitches and to the academy.

Pardew has been on Tyneside since news broke of his decision to quit Newcastle for Palace on Sunday night.

He met club officials on Monday and the terms of his departure have now been finalised. His exit – after four years in charge – is thought to be amicable and both parties have wished each other well.

John Carver and Steve Stone will now take charge of the New Year’s Day visit of Burnley and Saturday’s FA Cup third round tie at Leicester.

Meanwhile, Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen is unsure whether he or Pardew will take charge of the New Year's Day trip to Aston Villa. 

Millen is preparing the Palace squad assuming he will be in charge of the away dugout at Villa Park.

'I am planning on picking the team against Villa,' Millen told a press conference on Tuesday, 'I said to the chairman that I can do the job [permanently] but he has been busy talking to Newcastle.'

He added: 'We will be ready for the Villa game - whoever is in charge.'

Millen, who is in his third caretaker stint at Selhurst Park since joining the club in November 2012, revealed he is unsure whether Pardew will keep him on the backroom staff.

He said: 'I don't know that will be Alan's decision. I would be happy to work with the football club, depending on my role.'

Asked if he was surprised by Pardew's decision to leave St James' Park, Millen said: 'I wasn't surprised. Alan has played for this club, he has a lot of fond memories. It means a lot to him.

'Palace is a good job for someone. The chairman wants to build on the success we have had.'

Reflecting on Neil Warnock's time as Palace manager, Millen said: 'It would be difficult for whoever came in after Tony Pulis.'

Pulis guided Palace to an 11th-placed finish in May but they are currently in the relegation zone.

Warnock was sacked after three wins in 18 league matches.
