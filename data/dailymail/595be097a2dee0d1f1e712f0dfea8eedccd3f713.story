The going got so tough for Barbados’ rugby sevens side yesterday that they were prompted to call on the son of soul star Billy Ocean.

But when Anthony Bayne-Charles ran on to the field as a second-half substitute, the tannoy announcer at Ibrox was not quick enough to put together a melody of Ocean’s greatest hits, which included, ‘When the going gets tough, the tough get going’ in 1990 and ‘Red Light Spells Danger’ in 1977.

Outside chance: Barbados were always going to be in for a tough ride at the Commonwealth Games

Unfortunately for the son of Leslie 
Sebastian Charles, Ocean’s real name, it was more a case of ‘There’ll be
 Sad Songs’ which was a hit for his dad in 1986 as his team never won a 
match, losing  56-0 to Scotland and 68-5 to Canada.

Despite the defeats, he still enjoyed the experience of playing in front of the biggest crowd of his rugby career.

‘My
 dad is on tour at the moment so he couldn’t come to Ibrox but it was 
great for me to run out in front of more than 40,000 rugby fans at the 
Commonwealth Games,’ said Bayne-Charles, who is eligible to play for 
Barbados because his mother, Judy, was born there.

‘At times like this you have to just take your chance and do your best.

‘I am musical and studied music at university but rugby is my passion; I have been playing since I was seven.

‘I am musical like my dad and when I retire I might do more of it but I am playing rugby at the moment and loving it.’

England beat Uganda 40-0 to register a second victory without conceding a point following their 57-0 thrashing of Sri Lanka.

Wales
 thumped Malaysia  52-0, while Scotland, after losing 17-14 to New 
Zealand, hit back by thrashing Barbados and Lee Jones said: ‘We’re 
playing well and if we keep doing what we’re doing then we can be 
confident of coming through.’
