The arrival of Prince William’s first child is to be marked with a commemorative coin.

The £5 silver coin will feature an image of St George and the Dragon first seen on a sovereign designed by Italian engraver Benedetto in 1817.

It was used last year on a limited edition coin to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Celebration: The arrival of Prince William's first child is to be marked with a commemorative coin. He is pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge last month

A source told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The 
Royal Mint’s plan is to announce it will be bringing out the silver coin
when the royal baby is born.’

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do not know the sex of their baby, which is expected imminently.

Photographers and reporters have been camped for days outside St Mary’s hospital in London, where the Duchess is imminently due to give birth to the future heir.

The Royal Mint has already revealed that babies born on the same day as the new prince or princess will be given a ‘lucky’ silver penny.

Bookmakers have revealed they have taken a large number of bets on the potential name of the Royal couple's child.

One of the names which many members of the public believe the baby could be called is George.

Bookmakers give the odds of the baby being called George at 10-1.

If William and Kate named their child George, it would become King George VII.

It is believed the Royal Baby could result in a £250 million boost for Britain's shops.

Speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge was expecting an early birth was quashed earlier this week after it emerged that Prince William plans to play in a charity polo match tomorrow. 

The father-to-be will take part in the game at Cirencester Polo Club in Gloucestershire but he will not be accompanied by his heavily pregnant wife. She will not want to leave her London ‘safety zone’ so close to her due date.

Kate herself let slip earlier this year that their baby was due in mid-July, a fact which has since been confirmed by palace officials.
