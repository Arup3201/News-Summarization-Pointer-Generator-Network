As it stands, US technology lovers can only take their instructions from a woman while those in the UK are given directions by a man's voice.

But all that is about to change.

Apple unveiled earlier this week that its latest software update for the iPhone will see users able to choose whether the phone's built-in personal assistant Siri speaks with a male or female voice.

For the first time, users of the phone will have a choice which sex Siri takes the form of when it tells them where the nearest takeaway is or puts an appointment in your mobile schedule.

And according to Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University in the US, research has shown that iPhone fans may trust male Siri's answers more than those that come from his female counterpart.

Nass, who studies people's interaction with technology, said: 'Female voices are seen, on average, as less intelligent than male voices.

'It’s safer in a sense to have a male voice in the sense that you’re not going to disappoint people as much.'

The new option offers users another opportunity to customise their phones, similar to options that allow users to customise their ringtones or chose an individual picture as their screen background.

The male voice which will be introduced for the first time to US users will already seem familiar to them as it is used on the Apple Support hotline and the United Airlines hotline, according to the Huffington Post.

The original creators of the technology behind Siri, which was snapped up first by Apple, are said to have envisaged multiple Siri characters and wanted to install technology that would see the iPhone mimic it's user way of talking.

But Nass said that Apple risks alienating customers by offering a choice of male or female Siri.

He told the Huffington Post that men and women tend to use different dialect as well as sounding different.

He said that unless the software sees separate dialects recorded for the male and female Siris then users won't trust the interface.

Leila Takayama, a research scientist at Willow Garage, a robotics firm, said that having a choice of voices may lead users to see Siri as more of a technology than a personality.

Experts claimed when Siri was initially launched that dominant gender stereotypes in different nations dictated whether a male or female voice was used.
