An Instagram account that openly mocks people on the street has been slammed on social media.

The account called The Murder Mall publishes pictures of people at the Surry Hills Shopping Village in inner city Sydney accompanied by cruel captions such as ‘dressing like a pork roast’.

Almost 2,000 people follow the account which pokes fun at those less fortunate, as well as police officers, overweight people and anyone else who the account’s owner and contributors deem as providing good comic value. 

This picture of a man sleeping on a wine box was captioned: 'Saturdaze. #sleep #in #grind #sav #plonk #mole #41winks #devon #murdermall'

The Murder Mall Instagram account was set up in September and already has almost 2,000 followers

Amongst the pictures is a photo of an apparently homeless man with an unbuttoned shirt sleeping on a park bench with the caption ‘spent. #tooearly #dozer’.

A close up of a man in a red t-shirt’s marked arms is captioned ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. #morning #dose #forearms #triceps #strength #motivation’.

An image of a bearded man holding a newspaper close to his face is accompanied by the line ‘should have gone to specsavers #space #cadet #zoned #reading #eyespy’.

While a sleeping elderly man with his head propped up on a box of wine is poked fun at with the caption: 'Saturdaze. #sleep #in #grind #sav #plonk #mole #41winks #devon #murdermall.’ 

'Quick shuteye in between meatings. #bad #gurls #meatpackers #hydepark #fieldtrip #noddinghill #murdermall,' the caption on this photo reads

This photo of a man eating is captioned: 'The Saturday Neanderthal breakfast. #dribble #boy #paleo #redfern #fieldtrip #murdermall'

'Lean back and relax. #ibiswhisperer #chill #friday #lifelong #holiday #murdermall,' this caption of a man lying on a wall reads

At the time of publishing this article there were 270 images posted on the account, including one of four police officers looking at some meat captioned ‘Pork meeting #pig #spit #acac #office #bbq #meating #surryhills #murdermall’.

A photo of a woman touching her face which has welts on it is titled ‘icepick’.

After the offensive account was flagged by the website Concrete Playground, one Instagram user commented: 'You are all f***ing spoilt garbage humans without an iota of empathy between you. Decent people are disgusted by you.'

Another disgusted social media user wrote: 'May misfortune strike you down so that you might learn compassion and respect for your fellow human beings.' 

Instagram user Amie Claire Thomas wrote: 'Perhaps you think it's cutting edge and super ironic to make fun of others for their disadvantage. But no, it's sick and disgusting.' 

And Twitter user Eddie Sharp wrote: 'I'm pretty disgusted at the amount of people I know who follow themurdermall on insta so they can laugh at homeless people. I can see you.'
