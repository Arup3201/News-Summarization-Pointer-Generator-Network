In a new interview, the Navy SEAL who claims he shot and killed Osama Bin Laden is saying that it doesn't matter who ultimately took down the terrorist.

'The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am The Shooter,' O'Neill said.

'Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him.'

What's done is done: Bin Laden shooter Robert O'Neill (above) said in an interview it doesn't matter who killed Osama, just that he is dead

Under fire: This comes as many are attacking O'Neill for making his identity as a Navy SEAL public

This was all revealed in a series of recorded interviews O'Neill had with journalist Alex Quade that were aired on Friday's AC360. 

He also revealed in these interviews that he and his fellow SEALs did not think they would make it out alive after raiding bin Laden's hideout. 

'Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,' O'Neill said of their acknowledgement that this would likely be the end for them.

'(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool.'

O'Neill's move to go public has been met with mixed response, and heavily riticzed among his fellow SEALs.

He sees it differently however, pointing out how films like Captain Phillips and Zero Dark Thirty both made his work very public, and that high ranking officials have no spoken openly about both incidents.

'Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,' he said.

'I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think.'

Public guy: O'Neill seems fine with his detractors these days in interviews, saying he doesn't care if people think he is 'full of s***'

As for those who question him, he is not letting it bother him.

'Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,' he said.

'You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.'
