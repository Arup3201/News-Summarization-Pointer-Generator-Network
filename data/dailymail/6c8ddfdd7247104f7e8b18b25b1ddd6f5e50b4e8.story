More than half Australian households are struggling to stash cash away each month while more than a third don't have $1000 cash on hand.

A survey of 1,500 households found 54 per cent were not saving and claimed they were going backwards in their finances, savings, loans, credit or equity and felt they couldn't raise $1000 if there was a financial emergency.

As well as the lack of cash and savings, employees also listed low wages, moderate job prospects, rising unemployment and a lack of job security were rated as one of the biggest concerns, according to ME Bank's biannual Household Financial Comfort Report.

The survey found 10 per cent of households were not saving and going backwards in their finances, savings, loans, credit or equity and feel they couldn't raise $1000 if there was a financial emergency

The high rise in households lacking cash savings is the biggest in three years, while only 46 per cent reported the ability to save each month.

ABC
 reports savings rates jumped to double-digit after Lehman Brothers 
collapsed, and have remained around 10 per cent since, even as interest 
rates were cut to record lows to encourage more spending.

The bank's economic's consultant Jeff Oughton told ABC that not only are many people struggling to put money aside, a large group do not have savings built up to meet an 'unforeseen large expense.'

'Of the order of 40 per cent are breaking even at the end of each week and another 12 per cent are actually overspending and drawing on their savings,' he said.

Meanwhile, with record low interest rates, even those who are financially stable saw 17 per cent are expected to rely on their own savings during self-retirement.

The report found 25 per cent of young singles and couples are more likely to fund their own retirement, while 23 per cent expect to rely on the government pension. The survey also found men put away more fund for their own retirement than 14 per cent of women.

Mr Oughton said the study shows older households with more assests have typically fared well in the current low interest rate environment.

'The financial comfort amongst the asset rich households has risen to record levels thanks to rising share and house prices,' he said.

'The best example there is the financial comfort of self-funded retirees - that's up 8 per cent to 7.8 out of 10, the highest of any household segment.'

He said the federal budget had a major negative impact on how people rated their financial position over the year ahead.

'67 per cent of households expect their financial situation to worsen during the next financial year because of the federal budget,' he said.

The report also found 45 per cent of Gen X are most likely to focus on paying off their mortgage, while working single parents and students were likely to be saving for a raining day.
