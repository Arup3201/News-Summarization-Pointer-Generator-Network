Since becoming part of the country's most influential family, she has been thrust into the media spotlight

But being centre stage has not stopped the Duchess of Cornwall from knowing how to fool around.

During a visit to a charity bric-a-brac store, Camilla posed for photographers while looking through a pair of makeshift binoculars.

Guess who: The Duchess of Cornwall posed with the makeshift binoculars during a visit to the Wiltshire Scrapstore and Resource Centre in Lacock

Having fun: During the visit the Duchess was presented with a book for The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby and also took arts and crafts materials for her grandchildren

The centre's staff were surprised when the Duchess spontaneously picked up the two matching pieces of pottery and held them to her face whilst laughing.

She was later given a present ahead of the royal baby birth at the Wiltshire Scrapstore and Resource Centre in Lacock.

She had joined a storytelling 
session when she was handed a book called The Best Present Ever as a 
gift for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby.

The fairytale, about the birth of the 
baby of a King and Queen, was written by the patron of the Scrapstore 
and Wiltshire-based children's author Neil Griffiths, who told the 
Duchess 'You might want to keep this until July'.

Hello: Camilla meets firearms and drugs sniffer dog Eric the black Sprocker and owner Stuart Phillips, during her visit to Community First's Youth Action Wiltshire programme at Langley Burrell Village Hall

Wheely impressed: The Duchess of Cornwall watches a mountain bike mechanics course run by Community First's Youth Action Wiltshire programme, whom she is Patron of, at Langley Burrell Village Hall

During the visit, which is near the 
Duchess's Wiltshire home, she toured the building - an Aladdin's cave of
unusual materials - filling a sack of arts and crafts materials for her
five grandchildren.

She met some of the 50 volunteers who run the charity by by knitting and sewing items for sale in the shop.

The volunteers also made the 
Duchess two chicken doorstops - one each for her and her husband - which
were labelled Charles and Camilla.

Camilla, who is passionate about the 
importance of reading and is patron of a number of literacy charities, 
then joined the storytelling session with a number of local children and
families in the newly-finished community room.

After officially opening the room, 
Camilla said: 'It's wonderful to find a gem like this on my doorstep. I 
will definitely be bringing my grandchildren here in the future.'

Jane Wheeler, chief executive of the 
Scrapstore, said: 'Thank you so much to Your Royal Highness, it's 
amazing that you are here to share this special day with us.'

After the visit Neil Griffiths added: 'It's such an honour to have this visit.

'There are over 50 amazing 
volunteers keeping this place going and for them to have this royal 
recognition spurs us on in these difficult times. It's great that the Duchess has put us on the map.'
