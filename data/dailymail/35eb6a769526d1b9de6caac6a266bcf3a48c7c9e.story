Her face said it all - Angela Merkel loves football.

And after watching her national side thump Portugal in their opening match at the World Cup in Brazil, the German Chancellor looks as chuffed as a 10-year-old fan as she posed with the team in the dressing room.

The team's star striker Lukas Podolski even posted a happy selfie with the Germany's leader following the 4-0 drubbing.

The 59-year-old football fan threw her arms aloft in celebration as she watched the ruthlessly-efficient Die Mannschaft from the stands in Salvador.

The dignitaries around her - which included former France star and current Uefa chief Michael Platini - were more controlled.

But not Merkel, who is renowned for showing her passion for football at matches.
