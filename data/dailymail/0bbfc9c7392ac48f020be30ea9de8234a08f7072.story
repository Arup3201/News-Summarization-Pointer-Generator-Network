Victim: Jamie Dack, 22, was found dead in a bin with his body burned

A former model shop worker was beaten with a baseball bat before being stabbed to death and set on fire in an industrial bin by four people he knew in a plot to to steal his credit card, a court heard today.

The body of Jamie Dack, 22, was discovered on Sunday morning by firefighters tackling a blaze in Southampton.

The remains of the poker fan who had recently quit his job, were so badly burned that officers were initially unable to identify the body's gender.

Donna Chalk, 20, Ryan Woodmansey, 31, Lee Nicholls, 28, and Andrew Dyer-Skeats, 25, appeared in court today charged with his murder.

The four suspects also face two charges of imprisonment and conspiracy to rob and the three men are additionally accused of causing grievous bodily harm.

Nicholls faces a further charge of racially aggravated assault for a separate matter.

Prosecutor Mark Gammon today told Southampton Magistrates Court: ‘The allegation is the defendants were acquaintances of the deceased and formed a plan between them to rob him of his cash card.

‘He was assaulted with a baseball bat, repeatedly stabbed and a doctor has found stab wounds in his neck.

‘Having been killed he was put in a domestic wheelie bin and taken to a large industrial bin where the body was burnt.

Evidence: Bins are removed from the Empress Road industrial estate, Southampton, after one was set alight and human remains were found inside

Grisly: A lorry carries the bins away as officers continue investigations and strive to identify the body. Three men aged 31, 28, and 25 and a woman aged 20 have been arrested on suspicion of murder

‘In interviews the defendants have either made denials or answered no comment.’

District judge Loraine Morgan ordered 
the public gallery from the court after a woman began screaming at the 
defendants as they were led from the dock.

Earlier, his family, who described the
crime ‘horrendous’ and paid tribute to the ‘loving son and brother’ who
was a ‘good natured young man who liked to chat and made friends 
easily’.

In a statement they said: ‘Jamie was well liked by everyone and he will be sadly missed.

‘He liked to chat and made friends easily and had a trusting nature.'

They added: ‘His whole family are devastated by his untimely death.

‘He was a young man who should have 
had his whole life ahead of him. This has been cut abruptly short by 
whoever committed this horrendous crime.

‘We would urge anyone who knows 
anything about Jamie's murder to get in contact with the police and let 
them know what you know. It could make all the difference and help them 
find who did this to Jamie.’

Mr Dack had worked for a shop that sold Airfix kits and model railways but quit five weeks ago, his former boss said

Andy Parratt, the manager at ModelZone in Southampton, said: ‘Jamie was a great worker and his death is a complete shock.

‘He was very passionate about the things we sell and was sociable and good with customers.’

He added: ‘He was a very clean-living person and I have no idea why anybody would want to kill him.’

A barmaid at the Saxon Inn, in nearby 
Totton, Hampshire, also said Mr played in their poker league but would 
not comment further.

Chalk, Nicholls, and Dyer-Skeats are from Southampton and Woodmansey is of no fixed abode.

They were remanded in custody to appear at Winchester Crown Court on Monday, April 16.
