At a glance, Montana Coughlan looks like a normal teenager with no worries in the world.

The 16-year-old One Direction fan loves singing, spending time with her friends and trying on make up and new clothes.

Yet she knows her health could change in a moment. At any point the teen could be struck down by violent bouts of sickness, vomitting up to 20 times an hour for days on end.

Montana, from Sheldon in Birmingham, suffers from a rare condition called Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome which can be triggered by anything from stress to excitement.

When struck by a bout of sickness, Montana Coughlan can vomit up to 20 times a day, for days on end

When in the midst of a painful cycle she will be sick repeatedly, day and night and suffer migraines and abdominal pain.

Yet despite her debilitating illness, which has meant long periods off school, she is determined to study for seven GCSEs.

Montana said: 'For me, tiredness, stress or worry can trigger a cycle.

'I can start throwing up at 11pm and vomit up to 15 to 20 times an hour.

'It’s really hard to deal with because I’m up all night throwing up and then I feel tired during the day.

'My cycles are random now but frequent. They can last for three weeks and then I will be OK for a week.'

Before she was struck by sickness, Montana went to stage school and appeared as an extra on the BBC 1 programme Waterloo Road.

But everything changed in five years ago when she was in year six.

The teenager, pictured with her mother Jackie Coughlan at the home in Birmingham, has been diagnosed with Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, which can be triggered by excitement and stress

CVS is characterised by recurrent, prolonged attacks of severe vomiting, nausea and lethargy, with no apparent cause.

It is thought there might be a genetic link.

Vomiting persists at frequent intervals, five to six times an hour at the peak, for periods ranging from hours to 10 days or more. It most commonly lasts for between one and four days.

Symptoms include: Severe and consistent nausea up to six times an hour, pallor, headaches and abdominal pain, lethargy and dizziness.

The onset of CVS can occur at any time but most commonly develops between the age of three to seven years and can persist for periods of time ranging from months to decades.

Her mother Jackie, 51, a hairdresser said: 'It just seemed that every month she had a bug, she was throwing up and it was to the day every month. It would last up to a week, she would vomit three times an hour.'

Doctors initially suspected a virus and prescribed Gaviscon.

But when Montana’s condition worsened she was referred to Heartlands and then Birmingham Children’s Hospital where specialists said it could be Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (CVS).

She was issued with a passport letter which meant if she had another sickness episode she would be admitted to a ward to see a consultant straight away.

Ms Coughlan, who is also mother to Daniel, 20, said: 'That letter was important because every time we had been to A&E, they would assume that it was anorexia, bulimia or was is it bullying, or a cry for help?

'I would say no. I would have to justify it. It was frustrating.'

The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, faces a daily dose of a number of different drugs to help control her condition

Because of the CVS, Montana missed family trips to Venice and London and spent a two-week break to Tunisia in a hotel room being sick. Her studies also suffered.

She said: 'I was missing so much school and then going back after long periods. At that age, I really struggled to catch up.

'A vomiting cycle felt like I was being punched in the stomach, I felt like I was being choked and I would have a bad migraine.

'There was no food in me and I would be drinking water because I would dehydrate so much and it would come straight back up.'

Montana said she is envious of her friends and just wants to get on with her exams and move on to Sixth Form

Distraught Ms Coughlan eventually got in touch with the Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association who recommended Dr Sonny Chong, a specialist at Queen Mary’s Hospital in London.

He ordered extensive tests and then prescribed tablets and vitamins.

The mother-of-two said: 'Montana got better for long periods of time and the vomiting wasn’t severe and manageable.'

Yet last October the teenager started suffering severe bouts again.

Ms Coughland said: 'Dr Chong feels that her body has become used to the tablets. For Montana to be sick is now natural to her, it’s part of her.'

Montana has now been prescribed a tablet which is used for chemotherapy patients to cope with severe sickness.

She returned to school on a reduced timetable last autumn and plans to take her GCSE exams this month, but in a separate room in case she falls ill.

Montana said: 'I want to go to sixth form and do exams with no worry. I’m so envious of my friends who are constantly in school and not missing anything. I want to do coursework and just do normal things.'

Meanwhile, Ms Coughland is raising funds and awareness of CVS. She holds raffles at her Castle Bromwich salon and recently organised a 5km sponsored walk at Sheldon Country Park attended by family, friends and local MP John Hemming, which raised £650.

She said: 'I want more people to be aware of CVS, some poor person might be suffering from this and think they just have a bug.'
