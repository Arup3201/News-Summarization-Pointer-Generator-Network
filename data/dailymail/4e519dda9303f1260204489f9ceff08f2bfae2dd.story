A Minnesota man who heroically stopped to help the victim of a car accident two years ago has finally returned to work after a long road of rehabilitation following the loss of his leg.

Keith Barnes, 39, has had sporadic contact with Alicia Kaufenberg, a 23-year-old college student who also lost her leg after Barnes and another man, Marcus Andary, attempted to carry her to safety and were struck by a drunk driver.

Both Barnes and Kaufenberg suffered serious injuries and required leg amputations; Andary, 21, died as a result of his injuries.

Barnes says that if he had the opportunity to do it again, he would never have gone to Kaufenberg's aid.

He spoke to Pioneer Press from the barber shop where he finally returned to work three months ago after almost two years of rehabilitation.

'I'm no hero,' said Barnes, who is a father of six from St Louis Park.

'My decision, it wasn't the best one. Next time, I'll call the police and stay put until the police come.'

Barnes' selfless action in going to the aid of someone in need had unforeseen consequences for everyone involved, not least Barnes himself.

Brave: Barnes lost his left leg when hit by a car while pulling a woman to safety from a rollover accident in December 2011

A truly tragic chain of events was set in motion the night of December 18, 2011 as Barnes was driving onto Interstate 94 by Lexingon Parkway.

Suddenly the car in front of him, driven by Kaufenberg, swerved to avoid a pick-up truck, driven by Andary.

Huge price: Barnes said he's not used to his prosthetic leg yet: 'I walk slowly because I haven't gained confidence,' he said

According to the Star Tribune, Andary had been attempting to change lanes when another car blocked him, so he veered back into Kaufenberg's lane.

The two cars struck and Kaufenberg lost control of her vehicle, which rolled over and landed on its roof.

'I know you see it in movies, but to actually see a full-sized car flipping in front of you, I was just shocked,' Barnes told Pioneer Press.

'It was terrible.'

Barnes, acting on instinct, parked his car and ran across the freeway to help Kaufenberg.

Her car had come to rest in the highway's west-bound fast-lane and she was struggling to crawl from the wreck.

Andary also ran to the aid of Kaufenberg and together he and Barnes pulled her from the car and began carrying her to safety when further disaster struck.

Eugene Michael Farrell, 63, was driving after drinking in a bar and had a blood-alcohol reading of 0.09, just above the state's legal limit of 0.08.

His Chevrolet Venture minivan traveling at 63mph hit Barnes, Kaufenberg and Andary, killing Andary instantly and claiming the left legs of both Barnes and Kaufenberg.

According to the Pioneer Press, Barnes sustained head trauma, internal injuries and fractures to his legs, wrist, shoulder and pelvis.

He was placed in an induced coma and his leg was amputated below the knee. Barnes said doctors told his family that he may never smile again.

'The doctor kind of hurt my feelings,' said Barnes.

'The doctor said I was never going to be able to cut hair again. Because of my arm. I really do believe the more I use it, it'll go back to normal. It's already starting to.'

Kaufenberg has not spoken publicly about the accident but she and Barnes were both disappointed to learn that Farrell, who has a previous careless driving conviction, was sentenced to just one year in prison.

Recognition: Barnes denies being a hero, but many disagree, including the Minnesota Board of Barber Examiners who honored him for his bravery and selflessness

All in all, it's a harsh outcome for two men who were acting on their instinct to help.

Barnes denies being a hero, butÂ  many friends and supporters disagree - including U.S. senator Al Franken, who stopped by the barbershop to thank him for his courage and sacrifice.

Barnes says he knows Kaufenberg may have some unresolved issues towards him about the results of his intervention.

According to Minnesota state law, a 
person is generally protected from legal consequences for stepping in to
help the victim of a crime and accident and making the situation 
unintentionally worse.

The Good Samaritan law varies 
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to who is protected from liability and in
what circumstances.

Barnes told Pioneer Press that Kaufenberg visited him at the Courage Rehabilitation Center but that the two haven't spoken in-depth about what happened.

'I've been wanting to,' he said.

'Just so we can sit and have a conversation, just so we can talk about it.'
