Three men were forcibly ejected from a cultural festival in Saudi Arabia amid concerns they were 'too handsome' for women to resist.

Religious police in the conservative Islamic kingdom removed the trio, all from the United Arab Emirates, from the Jenadrivah Heritage and Culture Festival in Riyadh on Sunday.

The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vices in Saudi - where there are strict rules governing interaction between men and women who aren't related - had the men deported back to Abu Dhabi in case women should 'fall for them'.

The men were at the festival as part of a delegation from the UAE, according to a report in The Telegraph.

It cited a report in Arabic newspaper Elaph which said: 'A festival official said the three Emiratis were taken out on the grounds they are too handsome and that the Commission [for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vices] members feared female visitors could fall for them.'

The UAE released an official statement indicating that the religious police were concerned about over the unexpected presence of an unnamed female artist in the pavillion.

'Her visit to the UAE stand was a coincidence as it was not included in the programme which we had already provided to the festivalâ€™s management,' the head of the UAE delegation to the festival, said in a statement.
