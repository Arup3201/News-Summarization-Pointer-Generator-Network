This hiker takes his life in his hands as he walks across one of the world’s most deadly hiking trails -by unhooking the harness that's holding him secure above a 7,066ft drop.

Balancing precariously on a three-foot-long wooden plank, the daring traveller pretends to step off the path and dangles a foot above the drop.

Tentatively putting one foot ahead of the other, he carefully shuffles along as he films the entire scene on a camera mounted on a selfie-stick.

Daredevil: The hiker unhooking the harness which is keeping him from falling 7,000 feet down

The daredevil is attempting the stunning plank walk on Mount Hua Shan, just outside the city of Xi'an, in China.

One of China's Five Great Mountains Hua Shan is classified as having five main peaks, of which the highest is the South Peak, which can be reached by a short gondola ride. 

And at the end of the ride is the famous Cliffside Plank Path hike.

The trail includes steel rod ladders, toeholds carved out of the cliff and the narrow wooden plank walks.

Precarious position: The man films himself with the help of a selfie stick as he walks down the narrow path

Risky behaviour: The traveller leans over the edge of the plank 

The total length of the path is only a few hundred feet long but it is very dangerous as there are nothing but planks to walk on and a rail of chains to hold on to.

A slim harness keeps walkers from falling but there is no one to ensure that walkers wear their safety gear.  

The bold hiker films himself leaning over the edge of the plank, tethered to side of the mountain only by the slim harness which is clipped to the thin wire that runs down the side of the mountain.

Stunning views: One of China's Five Great Mountains Hua Shan is classified as having five main peaks of which the highest is the South Peak, where the plank path starts

But then he decides to unclip the the two straps that hook him to the from safety line and casually walks across the narrow plank.

‘Nah, don’t need it,’ he says to his camera before panning it around to show the undoubtedly stunning views around him.
