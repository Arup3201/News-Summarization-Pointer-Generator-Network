When planners in China were asked to construct a new railway line in a residential area, they came up with an ingenious way of getting round the problem of demolishing people's homes  – by building the track so it runs right through them.

The astonishing train line runs right through the middle of the building in Chongqing, known as Mountain City for its countless skyscrapers, and is one of the most heavily populated areas in China with nearly 33 million people.

Planners behind the monorail said they were forced to come up with the plan to cope with overcrowding in the city. There is even a small station which is captured in the footage shot by a passenger on the train.

But instead of blighting residents’ lives with the sounds of trains passing through, planners claim the train line has increased the value of the apartments because it is so convenient for transport links.

According to them, the trains produces just 60 decibels of noise as it passes through the building — about at loud as a dishwasher.

City transport spokesman Yuan Cheng told the Daily Star: ‘Our city is very heavily built upon and that can make finding room for roads and railway lines a real challenge.

All aboard! This train runs right through a block of flats in one of the most densely populated areas in China

Coming through: Locals say there is limited noise produced by the train and it has boosted property prices

‘Sometimes there just isn't room on the ground so we have to think about going under, or over, or - in this case - straight through.

‘In a city as fast paced as this it was clear people wanted to get around quickly. Extending the railway line this way was a gamble, but it was one that paid off.’

The news comes as hundreds face having their homes bulldozed in the UK with the development of HS2, a high-speed railway line with trains running between London and Birmingham.
