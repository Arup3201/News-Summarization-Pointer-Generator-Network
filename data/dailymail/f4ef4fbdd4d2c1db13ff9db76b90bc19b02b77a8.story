One hundred years of commercial airline flight will be marked tomorrow with a re-enactment of the very first fare-paying journey.

On January 1, 1914 the St Petersburg-Tampa Airboat line was able to make a 23-minute flight across Tampa Bay in Florida - and tomorrow, a replica of the first airboat will take off and fly the same route.

The 18-mile flight - which was 11 hours quicker than travelling between the two cities by train - safely transported 1,200 passengers across the Bay in a Benoist Model XIV aircraft with a 75HP engine.

But it was forced to close at the end of March 1914 after just three months in operation because it did not have a continuing subsidy from St Petersburg or a steady income from tourist traffic.

The re-enactment starts a year of celebrations backed by the International Air Transport Association.

As preparations got under way for the replica flight, Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways’ parent company IAG, hailed the success of commercial aviation’s first 100 years.

He said: ‘Aviation is a miracle. It’s truly wonderful. Everybody who lives finds it somehow touches their lives. Without question, aviation is a force for good.

‘There are issues we must address such as the environment where our performance must improve, but it’s a fantastic industry.’

Mr Walsh highlighted the rise of the low-cost airlines in recent years, saying ‘now everybody expects to be able to fly’.

He went on: ‘I generally believe we are at an exciting stage in aviation where we can improve our environmental and financial performance.’

Iata director general and chief executive Tony Tyler said: ‘Over the last century, commercial aviation has transformed the world in ways unimaginable in 1914. The first flight provided a short-cut across Tampa Bay.

‘Today the aviation industry re-unites loved ones, connects cultures, expands minds, opens markets, and fosters development.

The Model XIV was purchased from  aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist (right) of Missouri.

It could carry only one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit.

Former St Petersburg Mayor A.C. Phiel paid $400 (£240) to be the first passenger, and the first flight was conducted by pilot Tony Jannus.

The aircraft was powered by a Roberts 75HP, six-cylinder, water-cooled engine.

The plane had a 44ft 6in wingspan and a top speed of 64mph, weighing 1,299lbs (589kg).

Flights on the airboat cost $5 (£3) per trip and there were two journeys each way every day.

‘Aviation provides people around the globe with the freedom to make connections that can change their lives and the world.’

Iata today released statistics which showed that on average, every day more than eight million people fly.

In 2013 total passenger numbers were 3.1billion - surpassing the three billion mark for the first time.

That number is expected to grow to 3.3billion in 2014 (equivalent to 44 per cent of the world’s population).

Iata also said about 50 million tonnes of cargo is transported by air each year, which is around 140,000 tonnes daily.

And it added that aviation supports more than 57million jobs with the industry’s direct economic contribution being around £337billion.

Global airline industry turnover is expected to be around £464billion in 2014, with an average industry profit margin of 2.6 per cent.
