Clutching an AK-47 and pointing to the sky, this 13-year-old schoolboy is believed to be ISIS' youngest jihadist and has joined a 5,000-strong army of European teenagers in Syria.

Younes Abaaoud, from Belgium, followed his older brother to the front line and is believed be among dozens of child-fighters in the war zone from Europe.

A series of images of the schoolboy posing with various weapons came weeks after the seven-year-old son of Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf was pictured in Syria holding a decapitated head.

Brussels-born Younes is said to have travelled to Syria with his brother Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 27, earlier this year.

Is this ISIS' youngest fanatic? Younes Abaaoud, 13, from Belgium, has fled his home to fight in Syria

Belgium's media has claimed they are the sons of Omar, a Moroccan shopkeeper who moved to the European country around 40 years ago.

The picture is one of several of Younes to surface online in weeks.

Another image shows the youngster in a similar pose, with a gun in hand and finger pointed upwards. 

Younes Abaaoud's identity has been tweeted by Shiraz Maher, an academic and senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College, London.

He wrote: 'One of the youngest foreign fighters we know of Younes Abaaoud, who was 13 when he left Belgium to join ISIS.'

The tweet has prompted shocked reactions from other Twitter. 

Photographs reportedly showing Abdelhamid, who is said to go by the alias Abou Omar Soussi, have also emerged.

One was tweeted by a Belgian journalist who claimed its showed the fighter with a German militant named Abu Azzam.

He also posted a picture which he said showed Abdelhamid pointing a gun while sat in a car tyre.

The older brother, pictured, has also been used as a poster boy for ISIS to recruit more people from Belgium

Britain has among the highest number of extremists fighting for ISIS - at least 500 - but Belgium has the highest proportion based on its population. 

Two girls, aged 15 and 17, are under investigation in France for allegedly making plans to join jihadis in Syria.

The Paris prosecutor's office said today that the girls, one from Tarbes in the south-west of the country, the other from the second city of Lyon, were placed under investigation a day earlier for criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise - a standard charge in terrorism cases in France.

The girls are under strict judicial control, according to the prosecutor's office. It wasn't clear whether they were returned to their families.

According to the French media the two girls were in contact with a third 14 year old girl, who headed for Syria last June.

About 60 investigations are currently in progress in France concerning would-be jihadis or those who have left for the battlefields. 

Some 900 French are implicated in the phenomenon which has spread across Europe and is deeply worrisome to authorities.

The Lowland country's security services said earlier this year that between 4,000 and 5,000 teenagers with EU passports may have left their home countries for Syria.

ISIS has also been kidnapping Kurds and other nationalities in the warzone. 

In June more than 140 schoolchildren were taken and 'brainwashed' into becoming suicide bombers for Islamist militants after being kidnapped in Syria.

The Kurdish pupils, aged between 14 and 16, were being held hostage in the ISIS-controlled city of Manbij, where they are being forced to take lessons in radical Islamic theology.

One 15-year-old boy, known as Mohammed, said masked fighters made him watch a video of fighters beheading a man on their first day - then warned he would face the same fate if he tried to escape 

Research by The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence in London said that overall Western Europeans now represent up to one in five of the foreign fighter population in Syria.

They say the most come from France whose Government says that at least seven of those are children and fifty are women.

France is followed by Britain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.   

Adjusting for population size, the most heavily affected countries are Belgium - up to 27 foreign fighters per million, followed by Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Austria.
