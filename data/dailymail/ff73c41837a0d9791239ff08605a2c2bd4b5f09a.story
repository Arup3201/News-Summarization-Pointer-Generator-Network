Prince Charles was all smiles as he joined a festive group of students at a London school this morning but left his Bentley parked outside at a disused bus stop.

The prince, 66, was at South Thames College in Wandsworth to meet a group of young people who had just completed a Prince's Trust personal development course - the 300th group trained by the school so far.

Luckily for the royal, whose choice of parking spot could have landed him a £70 fine under normal circumstances, the bus stop was out of use.

The prince did, however, get a warm welcome from a family standing at the bus stop and when he asked if they were waiting for transport they replied: 'No, for you Sir'.

Once inside, Charles was introduced to teachers and students before cutting into the celebratory 300 themed cake.

He then delighted onlookers by tucking into a slice of the tasty-looking cream-filled sponge cake and later joined staff at the school for a cup of coffee.

Surrounded by young people who had taken part in the Team programme, the prince paid tribute to their achievements.

'Well done all of you,' he said. 'Thank goodness we've got supporters like you to keep this show on the road.'

In a group discussion with those who had been on the course and moved into education or employment, Charles said he was particularly encouraged to see so many like  Matthew Campbell, who have come back to the Trust to help other young people in similar situations.

Mr Campbell, 24, was homeless and unemployed when he was introduced to The Prince's Trust in 2012.

Not allowed: According to government regulations, there are no exemptions to the no bus stops parking rule

All smiles: Inside, the 66-year-old was all smiles as he met a group of students helped by the Prince's Trust

Celebration: South Thames College has now put 300 groups of students through the Team training course

Tasty: Prince Charles delighted well-wishers by tucking in to a slice of the tasty-looking sponge cake

'Being a Prince's Trust young ambassador is one of the greatest achievements of my life,' he said, delightedly.

'Thank you, Sir. The confidence and self-esteem I gained has helped me in every part of my life. I have seen how programmes like this can help young people. 

'I was homeless and at rock bottom and now I'm living in Surbiton, studying Youth Work at London Met and have come back to volunteer with the Prince's Trust on the same programme that helped me to turn my life around.'

This is not Charles' first visit to the school, with the royal having made a previous visit alongside the Duke of Cambridge in 2005.

South Thames College's partnership with the Prince's Trust is even older and dates back to 1997 when the college launched its first training course.

The 12-week courses are part of a programme operated by the Prince's Trust and aim to boost the skills and confidence of the young unemployed.

Passion: To date, Charles' Prince's Trust has put more than 176,000 people through the Team course

Confidence: It aims to give unemployed young people the confidence to find work or go on to university

To date, the Team programme has helped more than 176,335 people - many of whom have taken the course at South Thames College, one of 300 centres to offer it nationwide.

So successful has the course been, three in four of those to take it have since moved into work, further education or apprenticeships, the latter also frequently supported by the Prince's Trust.

Charles has had a busy period of late and spent yesterday morning at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust where he and Princess Alexandra helped it celebrate its 50th anniversary. 

During a visit to the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, he chatted to people receiving treatment for the illness and made an impromptu speech praising hospital staff.

'I just want to say, I'm so delighted to have a chance to visit the hospital and the unit here, which I know does such wonderful work on the cystic fibrosis front,' he said.

Praise: He also made an impromptu speech praising the work of staff at the Royal Brompton Hospital

'But also I'm so proud to have become patron of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in its 50th anniversary year.

'Over all those years I know the Trust has battled in the most remarkable way, together with so many people like yourselves who help to assist patients with this appalling condition.

'I just wanted to use this opportunity not only to salute you all for the work you do, but also to wish all those who I know are doing such good work in finding better and better answers to dealing with this condition every possible success in the future.'

Speaking after the visit, Ed Owen, chief executive of Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said: 'As a long-time supporter of people with cystic fibrosis, the prince has a deep understanding of the challenges that people with the condition face, including the daily burden of physiotherapy, nebulisers, dozens of pills and exercise, as well as regular hospital visits and admissions.

'Today less than half of people with cystic fibrosis will die before their 40th birthday, but we are committed to changing this. 

'We are redoubling our efforts to beat cystic fibrosis for good, and the prince's support will provide a powerful beacon of hope for all those touched by the condition.'
