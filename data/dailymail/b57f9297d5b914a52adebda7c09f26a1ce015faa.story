Amy and Jerry Pajotte love the New England Patriots just as much as they do each other, which is why last month they couldn't help but include the team in their wedding day celebrations. 

The couple, who moved to a house right next to Gillette Stadium four years ago,  got married in custom-made Patriots gear, included football references in their vows and made their grand entrance at the reception to the team's song. 

All of this garnered them attention from team owner Robert Kraft, who gave the newlyweds front-row tickets and a field pass to the Patriots' game against the Chicago Bears as a wedding gift, which Amy attended in her gown.

'This is an experience we are going to remember for the rest of our lives,' Jerry told the Foxboro Reporter. 'To be able to do this after our wedding, with Amy in her dress, and around the people that we love and the crowd and the fans that we love, there's nothing better than this.'

Kraft found out about the diehard couple's nuptials after Jerry  wrote him a letter detailing their elaborate wedding. 

Bride Amy's 'something blue' was her shoes, Patriots blue heels with the team's Minuteman logo. Meanwhile, Jerry wore a tie and vest with the logo as well and his groomsmen donned custom-made jerseys with each of their last names emblazoned on the back.

At the ceremony, the bride and groom exchanged their own vows, promising to 'stay together through touchdowns and fumbles'.

'And that's good for a Patriots first kiss,' the wedding officiant said at the end. 

To make their entrance at the reception, the Pajottes came in to Ozzy Osbourne's 'Crazy Train' - the same song that the Patriots use to arrive on the field before each game.  

'We all got into a circle and were jumping up and down and cheering. It was almost like a real Patriots entrance,' Jerry said. 'We are still getting text messages about that entrance. It was awesome.'

Honeymoon: The morning after watching their favorite team vanquish the Chicago Bears on October 26, the Pajottes boarded a plane to St Lucia for their honeymoon 

Kraft found the ceremony charming, and after sending the newlyweds tickets, he made a surprise stop at their house on the way into the stadium on game day.

The new Mrs Pajotte was so excited to see the Patriots owner that she ripped her wedding dress running out of the house to greet him. 

After that, the couple took their usual route over the railroad tracks to Gillette Stadium to see the Patriots beat the Chicago Bears 51-23. 

The next morning, the couple boarded a flight to their honeymoon in St Lucia.
