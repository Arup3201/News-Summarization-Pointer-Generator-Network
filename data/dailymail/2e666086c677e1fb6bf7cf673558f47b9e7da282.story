This is the dramatic moment a car burst into a ball of flames after thugs put a lit firework up the exhaust pipe.

The Renault Megane became engulfed in flames after the firework went off inside the exhaust while the vehicle was parked on the high street in Earls Colne, Essex.

The force of the explosion and subsequent fire was so fierce it shattered the windows of nearby shops and homes, causing tens of thousands of pounds worth of damage.

The force of the explosion caused windows of nearby shops and homes to shatter amid fears the fire would spread. A father and his two children had to evacuate their flat but firefighters managed to control the blaze

A father and his two young children were forced to evacuate their flat in the quiet village amid fears the fire would rip through nearby buildings.

Firefighters spent more than 50 minutes trying to put out the flames and stop them spreading to nearby properties during the incident on Saturday night.

Fire crews said the buildings within close range to the burning vehicle would have caught alight if the blaze had raged for another five minutes.

Colin Abbott, owner of Abco insurance and financial services which had its windows blown out in the incident, said: 'It was a blessing nobody has been hurt.

'We have been here 25 years and it is heart-breaking to see the damage but the main concern was the man and two children upstairs.'

Mr Abbott said residents phoned him to tell him about the blaze, enabling him to rush back to his shop.

He said: 'It is a 12th century building and it could have been horrendous.

'The people who did this probably did not understand the extent of what they have done.

The blaze completely damaged the Megane and caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to nearby shops

Workers from Abco Financial Services, the shop also severely damaged by the blaze (pictured behind the vehicle), assess the extent of the damage caused by the explosion as police issue warnings to firework users

'They had what was effectively a bomb and in the wrong hands and in the wrong place it could be deadly.

'It has caused tens of thousands of pounds damage.'

Totteridge Gallery, next to Mr Abbott's shop, was also damaged when the Megane went up in flames.

Essex Police said the force had been informed of the incident and urged members of the public who suspect people of using fireworks dangerously to contact police.

A spokesman said: 'The public should be are aware of the dangers of using fireworks outside of a controlled environment.

'They can cause serious injury and damage to property.'
