One of Sydney's popular shopping precincts has been listed in the top five expensive places in the world to rent as retail space.

This was unveiled in the 2014-15 edition Cushman and Wakefield's Main Streets Across the World survey,  showing Australia's Pitt Street Mall jumped from eighth to fifth place since the last 2013-14 report.

Sydney is placed after New York's Upper 5th Avenue which is the costliest destination in the world followed by Hong Kong's Causeway Bay, Avenue des Champs-Elysees of Paris and London's New Bond Street.

One of Sydney's popular shopping precincts - Pitt Street Mall - has been listed in the top five expensive places in the world to rent as retail space

This was unveiled in the 2014-15 edition Cushman and Wakefield's 'Main Streets Across the World' survey, showing Australia's Pitt Street Mall jumped from eighth to fifth place since the last report

With a growth of 25 per cent in rental costs over the past year at Pitt Street, this is the second most significant increase in the Asia-Pacific region after Bejing's CBD recorded 26.4 per cent.

The report, released about two weeks ago, sourced the dramatic rise of rent on Sydney's prominent shopping area to 'a large influx of international retailers signing new leases in the last six months and taking up large space'.

'This was generally through the amalgamation of several smaller stores, which in turn significantly reduced the supply of traditional 200 square metre units,' the report continued.

The report further found Pitt Street Mall rents cost US$1,016 (about AUS$1,185) per square foot, which is more expensive than well-known shopping districts such as Milan's Via Montenapoleone and Tokyo's Ginza.

The prominent Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris retained its third place in the list of expensive retail spaces around the world

Hong Kong's famous Causeway Bay , ranked first last year, dropped to second place in this year's report

Rents at New York's Upper Fifth Avenue, which was placed second in last year's report, reached a record US$3,500 (about AUS$4,085) per square foot per year.

Hong Kong's Causeway Bay saw a fall of 6.8 per cent in rents from first place to second.

Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris retained its third place as well as London’s New Bond Street in fourth.

The Cushman and Wakefield survey ranks 330 locations across 65 countries around the world. 

Pitt Street Mall has seen the addition of international fashion brands including Zara and Uniqlo pop-up store.

Multi-billion dollar fashion chain H&M also announced in September they will open its second Sydney store in Pitt Street's Glasshouse centre in mid-2015.

The first Sydney store was welcomed at North Ryde's Macquarie Centre, north-west of Sydney, last month.
