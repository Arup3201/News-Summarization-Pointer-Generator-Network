If you’ve ever wanted to sail through the world’s powerful ocean currents, then take a look at this.

Created by Tokyo-based Cameron Beccario, this interactive globe shows the ocean currents in real time as they swirl around continents.

Users can drag the globe to their desired location and click on the spot they want to find out an ocean current in all its grandeur.

The detail is incredible. A region that looks calm at first glance is seen as an active area of currents on closer inspection, using the mouse wheel to zoom in.

Fascinatingly, the globe gives viewers an insight into the five major ocean gyres, the large systems of rotating ocean currents, particularly those involved with large wind movements.

The five - located in the Indian Ocean and in the north and south of the Pacific and the Atlantic - are clearly visible and their affects can be traced throughout the world.

Ocean currents transport huge amounts of heat around the world, making them one of the most important driving forces of climate.

The
 currents are generated from the forces acting upon the water like the 
Earth's rotation, the wind, the temperature and salinity differences and
 the gravitation of the moon.

The map relies on data compiled by NOAA's Global Forecast System to update its global wind patterns every three hours, and OSCAR Earth and Space Research to update its ocean surface current patterns every five days.

Details are thin on the ground on the sparsely-designed website, created by software engineer Mr Beccario, but it describes itself as a 'visualisation of global weather conditions forecast by supercomputers'.

It follows an interactive global wind map, also created by Mr Beccario. Studied together, they reveal just how unpredictable our planet’s weather system can be.

Perhaps the most striking example is the Gulf Stream, which makes northwest Europe milder than other regions at the same latitude.

Users can zoom in on the currents, which are colour-coded to show the severity of the wind. Here we see the Atlantic to the west of Ireland swept by powerful gusts

It appears to take inspiration from the U.S-specific wind map created by designers Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg and shows currents across the U.S. in stark monochrome.

The latest weather-model also has a passing similarity with Nasa’s mesmerising Perpetual Ocean video.

It uses data from the National Centers for Environmental Protection, the US National Weather Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
