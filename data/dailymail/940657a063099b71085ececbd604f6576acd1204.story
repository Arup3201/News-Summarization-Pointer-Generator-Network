Who said a McDonald’s is the same wherever you go? 

From the Dallas outlet housed in giant Happy Meal boxes to the restaurant in a stunning 1930s Art Deco hotel, diners who have had enough of run-of-the-mill outlets can now choose to eat in any one of these 14 unusual locations.

With over 35,000 restaurants across the globe, it comes as no surprise that the American chain, which serves food in 118 countries, has some rather off-the-beaten-track sites.

And, unsurprisingly, most of these strange fast food locations are all in the States.

One outlet is housed in a preserved 19th-century Georgian Mansion in New York while another is in a converted  1930s Art Deco hotel, proving that that the fast-food giant doesn't always obliterate the unique character and history of towns it descends on.

But, alongside the sensitively restored buildings, are some frankly bizarre locations as well.

There’s an outlet smack bang in the middle of Israel’s Negev desert where discerning diners can chow down on burgers against an arid landscape of sand dunes. 

And those with far-left leanings don't have to miss out as the stalwarts of American capitalism have an outlet right below the Museum of Communism in Prague.

Other unusual settings include the first ever ski-through restaurant, McSki in Lindvallen, Sweden, the UFO-shaped outlet in Roswell, New Mexico and rather incongruously, a restaurant set against the backdrop of the magnificent mountains in the picture-postcard pretty village of Yangshou, southern China. 

This outlet in Dallas, Texas looks like a giant Happy Meal box and and has giant sculptures of French fries, Big Macs and Ronald McDonald plastered all over it

The Golden Arches, set against a backdrop of majestic hills, seem out of place in the picturesque village of Yangshuo in Southern China

Viva capitalism: Prague's Museum of Communism, which has immersive workshops, an interrogation room and historical schoolrooms also has a McDonald's right below it

Take to the slopes: The world's first fast-food ski-through is in the resort of Lindvallen in Sweden. Customers can ski right up to the counter, order their food and ski off 

Sensitive restoration: Try to spot the discreet McDonald's sign. The restaurant is set in this 1850s colonial house in Freeport, Maine which was once owned by a sea captain

 

Make a food withdrawal: Formerly a bank in Kristiansand, Norway this building now deals with nuggets of chicken rather than nuggets of gold

The ground floor of the Bray Town Hall in Northern Ireland has been home to McDonald's since 1997

Views of sand, sand and more sand is what greets diners at the Negev Desert branch in Israel. The outlet does brisk business with tourists passing through the desert on their way to Israel's resort towns

Barstow Station McDonald's in California is set in refurbished rail cars and has a towering sign on the water tower for those who might just miss seeing the outlet

What's the difference: The Golden Arches were painted green in keeping with Sedona, Arizona's zoning ordinances. The company had to build a restaurant that blended into the natural setting 

It's a Mctakeoff: The 20-seater McDonald's housed in a vintage luxury DC-3 plane with red and silver interior seats. The plane was bought by the fast-food chain who already have a restaurant next to it in Taupo, New Zealand

An invasion: Don't mistake this for a UFO. The Roswell outlet is, aptly enough, shaped like a flying saucer and attracts alien enthusiasts from across the world

The colonial era McDonald's, set in a 19th-century Georgian mansion in Hyde Park, New York. Local activists saved the building from being razed by petitioning to give it secured landmark status

 

The Art Deco McDonald's in Melbourne, Australia comes with a retro dining room and neon lights. The building was once the United Kingdom Hotel and was designed by architect James Hastie Wardrop.
