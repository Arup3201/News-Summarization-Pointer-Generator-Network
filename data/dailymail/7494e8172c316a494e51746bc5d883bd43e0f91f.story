A man's home is his castle –  especially when he’s spent £100,000 lovingly transforming it from a 1960s bungalow.

Businessman Syed Raza Shah spent most of his life savings adding two extra storeys to the flat-roofed property, not to mention a turret and sweeping balconies.

The result is a seven-bedroom home for him, his wife Farah and their four teenage children, worth £2million.

A man could be forced to tear down £2 million dream seven bedroom home after he built an 'inappropriate' extension

Trouble is, the council says that 
wasn’t quite what Mr Shah had permission to do – so it has served him 
with an enforcement order to demolish the house.

Mr
 Shah was granted planning permission to increase the floor space of the
 old house by around 45 per cent, and to build a new roof, but the 
council says he has far exceeded that, effectively making it a ‘new 
build’.

He applied for 
retrospective planning permission for what he calls the ‘minor 
adjustments’ to the bungalow, but it was refused because the house is in
 the green belt and an area of outstanding natural beauty.

Syed Raza Shah was given permission to increase the floor space of a five-bedroom bungalow (pictured) in Barton-Le-Clay in Bedfordshire by 45 per cent

Mr Shah bought the 1960's bungalow for £750,000 in 2008 and soon started work on an extension, which he said was agreed by local planners

Yesterday
 Mr Shah, 45, a director of a beauty salon, who is appealing against the
 decision, admitted he ‘bent the rules slightly’.

But he disputes the 
council’s claim that he has increased the floor space by 200 per cent 
and questions why it waited until the end of the 18-month construction 
before ordering his new home to be razed to the ground.

He said: ‘The council haven’t done their homework properly before issuing an enforcement notice.

‘Their
 200 per cent figure is ridiculous. They have lost the plot. I have 
measured it myself and I’ve increased it by 12 to 15 per cent. Yes, I 
have bent the rules slightly. But I only did it to make it aesthetically
 more pleasing. The old building was dilapidated; it was just awful. It 
was ugly and people have said it looked like a caravan site.

But officers at Central Bedfordshire Council say the resulting three-storey building, complete with a turret and long balcony, amounts to a 200 per cent increase and they have refused retrospective planning permission

The council has said the amount of alterations mean the house is now a totally new building and has served Mr Shah with an enforcement order to demolish the home

‘Yes, we have made some minor adjustments, but I don’t see the decision that has been made justifies demolishing the house.

‘I apologise for bending the rules, but the building has been going on for months.’

He
 bought the five-bedroom bungalow in the village of Barton-Le-Clay in 
Bedfordshire for £750,000 in 2008, and started work on extending it.

Called
 The White House, it is set back 200ft from the road and approached by a
 winding driveway, with the nearest neighbours 20 yards away on either 
side.

There have been 11 
formal complaints from neighbours, who say the property ‘clashes with 
other houses on the road’ and it ‘sticks out like a sore thumb’. The 
parish council also says it is ‘out of character’ and 
‘disproportionate’.

But Mr Shah countered: ‘It doesn’t overlook anyone, and you’ve always been able to see it from the road.’

Councillor
 Nigel Young said: ‘Councils must follow planning law and planning 
regulation and this is well outside planning regulation, so we are 
obliged, as we are with all cases of unlawful development, to act on 
behalf of all our residents and issue enforcement notices.’
