Political pawn: Lingerie model Louise Cole (pictured) was unwittingly touted as a 'nurse' on a Lib Dem website boasting tax cuts for 'ordinary workers'

A pretty nurse touted as an 'ordinary worker' on a Lib Dem website has been uncovered as an underwear model who once stood against them.

Lingerie model Louise Cole is seen dressed in a nurse's outfit and carrying a clipboard under a headline boasting a '£600 tax cut for every ordinary worker in the country'.

But the ordinary 'health professional' has been uncovered as stunning underwear model Louise who stood against the Lib Dems for the Miss Great Britain Party.

Sexy Louise, 34, stood in the Henley by-election promising 'to make Westminster sexy not sleazy'.

The Wonderbra model was yesterday unaware her nurse's outfit shoot was being used by Nick Clegg's party to boast about helping the 'ordinary worker'.

Louise said: 'I did a modelling job as a nurse and they must have used a picture from that.'

But stunning Louise, who models for the luxury lingerie labels Gossard and Berlei, admits she could never make it as a nurse.

'I don't think that is for me, I'm not very good with gore and blood,' she said.

Louise, of Chichester, Sussex, stood against the Lib Dems in 2008 for the Miss Great Britain Party.

She said the minority party - made up of candidates who had previously stood in the beauty pageant - was 'a good, fun, experience' but the Westminster political life was not for her.

'There are other things I would rather do,' the successful underwear and swimwear model said.

Political opponents last night branded the gaffe an embarrassment for the Lib Dems, who are currently in the middle of their party conference in Brighton.

Up front: Louise stood in the Henley by-election promising 'to make Westminster sexy not sleazy'

Labour MP for Newport East Jessica Morden said: 'That the Lib Dems struggle to find real people willing to endorse them is of no surprise, given how quickly they betrayed their principles at the prospect of power.

'With form for dressing up staff in costumes to use as endorsers in the past, this is another embarrassing gaffe from an increasingly out of touch party.'

In 2010 a Lib-Dem member of staff was caught out posing as a nurse in a party election leaflet.

It showed Cardiff North candidate John Dixon talking to a woman wearing a nurse's uniform - who turned out to be a female party official in an outfit.

The Liberal Democrats yesterday played down the incident.

A spokesman said: 'Nurses, models, teachers, workers on low and middle incomes, Labour supporters, Lib Dems and even the Tories will have £600 taken off their income tax bill every year thanks to what the Lib Dems are doing in government.

'We want to create a stronger economy and a fairer society and our income tax policy is helping over a million workers in Wales.'
