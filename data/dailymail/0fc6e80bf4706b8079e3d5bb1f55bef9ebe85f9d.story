The secret of how the legendary Star Wars spaceship the Millennium Falcon was built has been revealed - in a high-security project codenamed 'Magic Roundabout' in the Welsh countryside.

The only full-size model of Han Solo's iconic craft was constructed at an aircraft hangar in Pembroke Dock, west Wales, where workers were sworn to silence over what they were making.

Newly released photographs show dozens of joiners, welders and metal-platers at work during the three months they spent putting together the giant freighter flown by Harrison Ford in the famous science fiction series.

It was built inside an aircraft hangar with workers involved in the project sworn to secrecy

The huge prop was made inside an aircraft hangar which had been home to the Sunderland flying boats during the Second World War.

The giant steel doors were kept shut from morning until night to hide the construction - there were no unauthorised visits, photographs were banned and the workers were sworn to secrecy.

But one amateur photographer managed to get a snap of the 'fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy' as it was nearing completion.

The never before seen picture shows how the Millennium Falcon earned its wings in the town of Pembroke Dock.

John Evans, a historian in the town, said: 'Star Wars has a global following and this is yet another great reason for tourists to come here.

'Pembroke Dock is a military town and we have people coming from far and wide to follow family footsteps, be it Navy, Army or Air Force.

'But there is also this incredible link to Star Wars which is almost a cult thing and a 21st century concept.

'People can still see the very building where the Millennium Falcon was made.'

The photograph was taken by local man John Clark, a foreman with Marcon Fabrications, a heavy engineering firm that serviced the UK's petrochemical and oil industries.

Work on the model (pictured) finished in 1979 and it was transported to film studios in Hertfordshire

Mr Clark recalled: 'One of the directors was in cahoots with someone with the studios or someone associated with the Star Wars films.

'I was very surprised that we'd gone that type of work because we built stuff for the oil industry and the offshore industry, but we got the contract. It was just a reasonable size team of workers that built all the framework.

'I was foreman on the job at the time. When we built it - as you can see on the photographs - we had it on hover pads on the legs so that it could be moved as though it was going to take off and so forth.

'We tried to keep it as much a secret as possible because you didn't want everybody prying and coming round the hangar, but it got out. People were prying and trying to see what was going on but half of them didn't believe it, saying: "Building a spaceship? That's rubbish".'

He said the Millennium Falcon was then disassembled into pieces so it could be transported to the studios in Hertfordshire.

'The artists in the film industry, the craftsman, went to work on it and made it into what you see on The Empire Strikes Back.'

Work on the spaceship finished in 1979 and the prop was then transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire

The company had been asked by filmmakers to build a life-sized, moving prop for key scenes in the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back.

And Mr Clark used his pocket-sized 110 camera to get a colour photograph of himself and two friends standing next to the Millennium Falcon.

Work on the spaceship finished shortly after the picture was taken in 1979 and the prop was transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire.

The film was released in 1980 and was a box office smash around the world. This was followed up by the third film in the trilogy, 1983's Return of the Jedi.

A permanent exhibition of Star Wars photographs, artefacts and memorabilia is being opened to celebrate Pembroke Dock's links with the iconic movie franchise.

Mr Evans added: 'This has been a huge thing for us.

'This is great for tourism and a very unique claim to fame for Pembroke Dock.'

Han Solo's much-loved Millennium Falcon (pictured) has taken a unique place in pop culture

In the 38 years since it first appeared on the big screen, the space ship piloted by Han Solo and his Wookiee assistant Chewbacca in the original Star Wars series has become an easily recognizable piece of pop culture.

Armed with laser cannons and the famed 'hyperdrive' technology, it featured in the first movie A New Hope and went on to become a regular setting throughout the series.

Such is the high esteem in which fans hold it, the exact specifications of the model, its weaponry, shielding systems and engines have all been meticulously documented.

The ship is technically a light freighter measuring 111ft in length by 82ft wide. While it is rounded and flat in shape, it measures 26ft high - inclusive of the attached exterior weaponry.

Its maximum speed is 1,050kmph. But this is vastly surpassed when it goes into 'hyperdrive' - a mode illustrated in the films when the stars surrounding it appear stretched or blurred as it travels through light years within the space of hours.

The ship is powered by five different engines - primarily a 'Quadrex power core' and four backup or emergency generators.

Its main weapons are 2G Quad Laster cannons and a hidden ground-defence blaster cannon, though many other improvised weapons make brief appearances in the films.

Capable of carrying six passengers, it is crewed by two people - those usually being Han Solo or Chewbacca - with provisions for two others to man guns during space battles.
