A Star Wars fan whose dying wish was to have a funeral with a difference had his dream come true when a team of Stormtroopers carried his coffin into the church.

Gordon Deacon, 58, had his coffin flanked by the white-armoured soldiers from his favourite sci-fi film at his funeral service in Roath, Cardiff, today.

The father of four, from the Llanedeyrn area of Cardiff, died last month after a 20-month battle with pancreatic and liver cancer.

Father of four Gordon Deacon, 58, who passed away following a 20-month battle with cancer, had his coffin flanked by Stormtroopers from his favourite sci-fi movie at his funeral service in Roath, Cardiff, today

The father of four, from Wales, died last month after a 20-month battle with pancreatic and liver cancer. His dying wish was to have mourners dressed in either Star Wards costume or Liverpool FC shirts at the service

The Stormtroopers, along with bounty hunter Boba Fett, led the horse-drawn carriage funeral procession to St Margaret's Church.

Mr Deacon's friends and family were then welcomed at the service by the Death Star troopers who donned helmets and guns. While Star Wars costumes were welcomed, Darth Vader was banned because no black was allowed.

The former housekeeper at the University Hospital of Wales, who leaves behind his four daughters - Lisa, Louise, Leanne and Cerianne – had requested that anyone who attended his funeral embraced his two passions – Star Wars and Liverpool FC.

His widow Marilyn, 54, said: 'He was mad on Star Wars. We went to see the first film in 1977 and ever since then he was fixated with it.

'We used to go to shows and he had a signed photograph of bounty hunter Boba Fett on the wall. He had Star Wars lightsabers, figurines, cookie jars, the lot.

'People could either wear Star Wars costumes, but not Darth Vader, or wear red for Liverpool.

'His favourite player was Steven Gerrard. We had planned to go to Anfield but we never got to go as he became too ill.

'I think he would be over the moon about the theme of his funeral.'

The Stormtroopers stood with their heads bowed in mourning as Mr Deacon's coffin was carried into the church.

The 22 members of his family were planning to wear red Liverpool FC shirts in honour of the Premier League side and it is thought his grandsons sang the club's anthem - You'll Never Walk Alone - at the church.

A Stormtrooper floral wreath was also arranged for the ceremony, along with a Liverpool FC shirt made of flowers.
