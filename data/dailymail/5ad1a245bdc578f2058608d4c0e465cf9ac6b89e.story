It was a shameless lie to the Duke of Edinburgh that pitched me into this. ‘And what sport do you do?’ he once asked sternly, glowering with apparent disapproval.

No sports journalist could merely say ‘walking’ or just ‘swimming’ when Prince Philip was such an action-packed figure himself, carriage-driving well into his 80s. So on the spur of the moment I said: ‘Climbing.’ It was a wild and incontrovertible untruth.

The only ascent I had ever made, apart from stairs, was Goatfell on the Isle of Arran, the summit of which is 2,867ft above sea level. Reaching the top left me feeling like Sir Edmund Hillary . . . until  I found I was sharing the achievement with a group of pensioners, a small girl in flip-flops and a large Dulux dog, all of whom had apparently rambled their way up with few signs of exertion.

The only way is up: Sue Mott makes her ascent at the Castle Climbing Centre in North London

So this was the reckoning. Climbing, as a sport, is currently enjoying a huge boom in popularity. More than five million of us are now swarming up indoor climbing walls and cliff faces in our spare time, according to the annual Sport England Active People Survey, and leading gym chains have invested seven-figure sums installing climbing facilities.

To the uninitiated, it might look risky, painful, vertiginous and a slow way to travel compared with, say, a cable car, but the statistics don’t lie.

And it is not just big brutes in shorts getting involved, either. There has been a significant rise in women and children taking part, with 14 per cent of schools offering climbing as an activity.

‘It’s an adrenaline activity that’s also a workout,’ said Tony Ryan of the British Mountaineering Council, whose official membership is 75,000 – a quarter of them women. ‘People are climbing as part of their general fitness routine and are finding it much more exciting than going to a multi-gym. It’s not just about brute force – it requires technique, balance, flexibility and agility as well as engaging the brain.’

This may explain the number of women shimmying up the fibreglass rock faces at The Castle Climbing Centre in North London when I, with huge trepidation, went to repair my Royal fraud.

On the rise: Five million Britons claim to be climbing - indoors or outdoors - in their spare time

Warning: if you are scared of heights, don’t even walk through the door. The facility is a converted Victorian water tower with walls rising on all sides, one of them rearing into the rafters to more than 40ft. They are pockmarked with small, screw-on ‘holds’ in different colours, some big enough (the comforting ‘jugs’) to accommodate both feet, some small enough to be virtually non-existent (the devilish ‘smears’).

If you’re wise, you will book a five-hour training course first. Six of us quivering novices treat the instructor, Julie, as a lifesaver, because she is. We listen with riveted attention as she teaches us how to put on our harnesses and tie knots. Eventually, strapped in and sufficiently well-knotted, we are allowed to walk gingerly to our first man-made rock face. ‘OK, up you go,’ she says to the first poor guinea pig.

In theory, someone is on the other end of the climbing rope and, if proper attention has been paid to the lesson, this person will act as a land anchor, preventing any accident occurring should the climber fall, faint or otherwise wimp out of their ascent. In theory.

Preparations: Sue learns how to tie a climbing knot

Modern life is all about comfort, speed 
and security. We don’t expect to be flung into a world where all 
existence depends on finding the next tiny toe ledge. It’s inelegant, at
the very least.

But then, with a lot of flapping of hands and flailing 
of legs, you begin to inch your way upwards, and with each surge of 
adrenaline comes a sense of achievement. While gravity is pulling one 
way, sheer belligerence is coaxing you the other.

Once past the point of no return – where you could just jump down safely of your own volition – you might as well keep going. The summit appears like a vision and the glow of triumph for reaching the top is really quite disproportionate to the accomplishment.

Coming down is great. You just abseil, hoping your partner is doing all the right things in the right order. For a brief moment the newly hatched climber feels at one with the great Johnny Dawes (Julie’s ex-boyfriend, as it turns out), who made the first ascent in the Eighties of the notorious Indian Face route in Snowdonia. I have no idea what this means but his exploits are all over YouTube.

Climbing is actually pretty safe. Academics at Oxford University have calculated the risk of death is statistically lower than for swimming, running, football and – believe or not – table tennis.

This is good to know because by now the first-timer is either in love or will never knowingly be lured into a harness again.

If you fit into the former category, there are 300 purpose-built, public-access climbing walls all over the UK, as well as nature’s own contribution, including the Plas Y Brenin National Mountain Centre in Wales, which runs courses.

The outside version of the sport provides a whole new set of worries including wind, rain and caterpillars in crevices. For those who just fancy indoor walls as a workout, the results are spectacular. Three days after my ascent, every muscle fibre in my body was still aching, from fingertips to toenails.

Clinging on for grim death is a terrific skeleto-muscular fillip, it seems.

Few parts of the body are untouched by the ordeal, including the brain, which has been silently screaming: ‘No!’ for four hours. As shock therapy, it is without equal.

If you’re looking to work off the inevitable damage done by festive food and drink, a trip to a climbing wall can be seriously recommended. And you may even find fame and fortune in the long run. Competition climbing is shortlisted for the 2020 Olympics.

Then there is the social aspect. Relatively cheap to indulge as a passion  (The Castle charges £12 a visit for unlimited time, with shoe and harness hire on top), there is a huge variety of genders, ages and sizes in attendance.

There’s nothing like making friends with someone as you plummet towards them off a boulder when that ‘crimp’ hold turned out to be no more than a ‘smear’.

It may even be that romances blossom, as climbing clubs are a pool of like-minded, action-bent people, who are all literally roped together.
