UEFA imposed the minimum one-match Champions League ban on Zlatan Ibrahimovic for his red card against Chelsea.

However, Ibrahimovic's Paris Saint-Germain teammate Serge Aurier gets a three-match ban for insulting the referee on social media.

UEFA says its disciplinary panel decided Ibrahimovic should miss only the first leg of the quarter-finals for a tackle on Chelsea midfielder Oscar last week.

Aurier, who was injured and missed the last-16, second-leg match in London, later posted a celebratory and offensive video on Facebook.

The Ivory Coast defender's comments about Netherlands referee Bjorn Kuipers in a video posted on Facebook were judged an 'insulting act' by UEFA.

PSG will learn its quarterfinals opponent when the draw is made Friday.
