Bayern Munich midfielder and Spain international Javi Martinez will have a scan on Thursday morning on a suspected anterior cruciate ligament tear.

The 25-year-old was injured during Bayern's 2-0 DFL Supercup defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night.

Martinez collided with a Borussia Dortmund defender and landed awkwardly, before being carried off on a stretcher.
