A mother killed herself the day after learning police had dropped an investigation into claims she was raped by a sex offender at an NHS clinic, an inquest heard.

Kylie Payne, 23, was found dead at a mental health clinic in Norfolk, just one day after she was told that police would not be pressing charges against the man.

Nurses had been told to monitor Ms Payne four times an hour but she was found dead on February 7, 2012, after being left unsupervised for 20 minutes, the hearing was told.

The mother of one was found hanged in her room at Meadowlands in Thorpe St Andrew, Norwich.

Norfolk Coroner's Court heard how she discovered that police had dropped charges against the man she accused of rape just a day prior, due to insufficient evidence.

A police investigation had been launched after she sent a text message to her aunt, Karen Payne, on Boxing Day 2012 in which she accused a fellow patient of rape.

The inquest heard how doctors became 'concerned' when she befriended the patient at the mental health unit, but did not warn her about his previous convictions because of confidentiality rules.

Assistant coroner David Osborne told the inquest that the patient Ms Payne accused of rape had a history of sex offences.

The inquest heard how Ms Payne told staff on Christmas Day that she had been raped by the patient and wrote a note outlining suicidal thoughts. She was put under extra observation and care workers were told to increase her supervision visits to six times per hour.

Following the five-day inquest, Ms Payne's mother Sheila, 42, told the Daily Mirror: 'I was in shock when I heard she had told staff that she'd been raped.

'I was angry at the clinic. Somebody like that should never have been in the same place as vulnerable women.'

Concluding the inquest last week, the jury returned a verdict of suicide and said failings of care contributed to Ms Payne's death.

They also ruled that the timing of police dropping the investigation was a contributory factor in her death.

Mother-of-seven Mrs Payne issued a statement through her solicitor Zak Golombeck, from law firm Slater and Gordon, in which she revealed plans to take action against Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Trust over her daughter's death.

She added: 'I am relieved that the results of the inquest highlighted failings into the care of Kylie.'

Since Ms Payne's death, Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Trust has introduced new measures to stop convicted criminals being admitted to low-security units.

The Trust also said that secure facilities had been changed to single sex accommodation.

Meadowlands was deemed no longer fit for purpose and closed in October 2013.

Jane Sayer, the Trust's director of nursing, said: 'Kylie's death was a tragedy for all concerned and we fully accept there were failings on our part. Our sincere sympathies remain with Kylie’s friends and family. 

'Following Kylie’s death in 2012, we undertook a serious incident investigation, commissioned an external review of the service, and implemented the recommendations made. 

'We continue to look at how we can improve the safety of vulnerable patients on an ongoing basis.'
