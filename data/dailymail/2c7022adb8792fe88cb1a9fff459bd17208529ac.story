The family of a serial party pest could lose their home, after an out-of-control party was shut down by police who were attacked with bottles by upset revellers.  

Perth Now reported riot police were forced to break up an out-of-control party in Bentley on Saturday night when 200 people spilled out into the streets.

Western Australian Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan has suggested that the mother of the teen who threw the party, Martin Fulton, 16, could face up to $12,000 in fines.

Martin Fulton, 16, said he arranged the party, but neighbours labelled him a serial party pest as he was always having parties there. Fulton had invited over 500 people on Facebook to the party. He even charged an entry fee – $5 entry before 8pm, $10 anytime after this, plus ones $10. 

When 30 police officers moved in to shut the party down they were bottled by revellers. 

'It was fine until the cops showed up, then they ruined it,' Fulton said.

Commissioner O'Callaghan has now said that the family must pay for the cost of the operation, reported 9 News. 

Legislation introduced in 2012 allows for those found guilty of throwing parties which require police control to be fined up to $12,000.

The Fultons' house is a welfare property owned by Foundation Housing, complicating the situation further as the incident could mean eviction for the family.

Representatives of the body visited Mr Fulton and his mother on Monday morning to speak with them about the possible consequences of the party.  

As Mr Fulton is a minor, his parent or guardian is held responsible for the party, meaning that the fine of up to $12,000 could fall squarely on the shoulders of his mother.

'We're actually sitting at the Midland Police Station this morning collating the cost of that operation because it's likely his mum will have to pay for it,' said Commissioner O'Callaghan. 

Mr Fulton's mother Michelle said that the party had nothing to do with her, and that she hadn't organised the party.

The teenager has said that he intends to pay for the fine, should it come to his mother, though he insists he did nothing wrong and said that he registered the party online, told neigbours and hired bouncers. 

When asked why the police were bottled, Fulton replied it was because they were trying to 'shut down a good party'

When asked why the police were bottled, Fulton replied it was because they were trying to 'shut down a  good party'. 

He said that what happened would not stop him from holding other parties in the future, and the next one would be on New Year's Eve.

Police Minister Liza Hardey said that it had been Mr Fulton's responsibility to manage the party properly. 

'If he can't and the police are called, they will use our out of control party legislation to prosecute him to the full extent they can,' said Minister Hardey. 

Mr Fulton still plans on hosting a New Years Eve party despite the legal problems his family is facing. 

On Saturday evening, police were called to the scene on Gambar Court just before midnight following reports of people fighting. When officers arrived, there were an estimated 200 people at the address.

Police entered the property and removed several people, while declaring it an 'out of control gathering.' A 20-year-old man allegedly refused to comply with police instructions and he was charged with obstruct police and disorderly conduct. 

Another 20-year-old man received facial injuries after being involved in an altercation with another party guest.

A Nollamara man, also aged 20, was arrested at the scene and subsequently charged with two counts of assault occasioning bodily harm. Police detained 16 juveniles and two other men were also issued move on notices.
