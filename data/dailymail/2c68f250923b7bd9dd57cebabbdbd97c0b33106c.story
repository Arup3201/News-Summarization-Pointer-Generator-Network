Brendan Rodgers insists there will be no lingering scars as Liverpool prepare for a first return to the stadium where their title hopes imploded.

Crystal Palace's extraordinary comeback in May at Selhurst Park, when they pulled back a three goal deficit to draw 3-3, left Liverpool's players shattered and effectively extinguished any chance Rodgers had of leading the club to their first title since 1990.

Liverpool go back to South London in a completely different vein of form, having only won one of their last six matches, and Rodgers needs to stop the rot. He has no concerns that what happened five months ago will have an effect, even though some critics say his squad haven't recovered.

'Our objective that night was to win the game,' said Rodgers. 'We were 1-0 up and then got a quick couple of goals after half-time. The excitement then took over and we maybe thought we could cutback Manchester City's goal difference. But the damage was done in the Chelsea game.

'On reflection after the game, I was proud of them for actually getting into that position in the league after I had got over the frustration and disappointment. The players are giving me everything. We just hope we can find that extra one per cent. Once we get confidence, the wins will flow.'

Rodgers, who has ruled out the prospect of Divock Origi joining Liverpool early in January, described Daniel Sturridge as being 'more down than I have ever known' as the striker faces up to six weeks on the sidelines.

His absence will leave more of an onus on Raheem Sterling to help spearhead Liverpool's attack and the England forward has revealed contract talks are ongoing. He has two-and-a-half years remaining on his current deal.

'Hopefully I can achieve the goals I want to achieve here at Liverpool in years to come really,' said Sterling. 'I am happy to be here for as long as possible like the big names that are on that wall. I am just happy to play football at this football club for many years to come.

'The club has spoken to my representatives and hopefully something can be done really soon. I thought we played well at times against Chelsea in our last match. We just need one result to kick us on. Hopefully it will be Palace on Sunday.'Â
