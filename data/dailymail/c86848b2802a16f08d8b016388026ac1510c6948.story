The frontline RAF Tornado squadron spearheading Britain’s air strikes on jihadist fighters in Iraq was saved from government defence cuts last night – for at least a year.

In a surprise visit to Cyprus, David Cameron announced that 102-year old No II Squadron, which had been due to be disbanded in April, would be reprieved.

Two more Tornado GR4 fighter bombers were also being sent to Cyprus as the UK intensified operations against Islamic State targets in Iraq.

With six Tornados flying daily sorties focused on IS fighters and their military hardware, the Prime Minister told air crews and troops at the giant RAF base at Akrotiri in Cyprus: ‘We want to make sure that we can keep up this tempo in the days ahead.’

Flying visit: David Cameron has announced that two more RAF Tornado bombers will join the campaign against Islamic State militants as he made a surprise visit to the Cyprus base the planes are flying from

Vow: The Prime Minister, arriving at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, also promised that the squadron which has spearheaded Britain’s air strikes on jihadist fighters would be saved from government defence cuts for a year

Mr Cameron visited Cyprus as Turkey’s parliament approved a motion that gives its government new powers to launch military incursions into Iraq and Syria and to allow foreign forces to use its territory for possible operations against the Islamic State group.

Its parliament voted 298-98 in favour of the motion which sets the legal framework for any Turkish military involvement, and for the potential use of Turkish bases by foreign troops.

Mr Cameron said he had visited Cyprus to hear directly from service men and women about ‘their operations, the challenges they face and what support they need.’ 

He announced the two additional Tornados being sent to the base and confirmed: ‘We will also extend the lifetime of Number Two Squadron for a further year to April 2016 to ensure we can sustain this effort in the months ahead.’

But critics of the cuts that have seen RAF fast jet squadrons reduced from 33 at the time of the first Gulf War to seven, said the original decision to axe II Squadron had been ‘disgraceful’ and the U-turn was a sign of the chaos within Ministry of Defence planning.

Reprieve: Mr Cameron said that the 102-year old squadron, which was due to be disbanded in March, would be reprieved until April 2016 as the UK intensified operations against Islamic State targets

The Tornados, which are more than 30 years old, were to have been replaced by state of the art Typhoons but incredibly they cannot match the weapons capability currently of the older plane – a capability needed for what Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has warned could be a three years operation against IS.

Missions over Iraq require the RAF to attack small mobile targets such as trucks and even motorcycles and the Tornado, carrying the Brimstone missile, is suited to this while it will take three years before the Typhoon is fully operational with it.

Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, said : ‘This illustrates the chaos in Ministry of Defence planning.

‘The RAF has been squeezed and squeezed and squeezed and now they have found we have reached the bottom of the barrel.’ He added : ‘If II (AC) Squadron is going to be spared, it makes sense. It would have been utter folly to get rid of the unit at a time when tasking is increasing by leaps and bounds.

‘Even though it will have a knock-on effect and create a bit of turmoil, for instance air crews will have already been told their new postings, this is a sensible course of action.

‘The Typhoons don’t have the capabilities to carry out the same role. To suggest they do is pie-in-the-sky.

Flying high: The Tornado aircraft was also due to be withdrawn from service next year, but its operational lifespan will now be extended until 2016

Grateful: Mr Cameron said he wanted to thank the armed forces for the work they were doing to 'defeat these barbaric Isil terrorists'

Air Chief Marshall Sir Michael Graydon, the former head of the RAF, said: ‘The decision to cut the Tornado squadron was pretty disgraceful so I’m delighted if this has been reversed. It is the most sensible thing I’ve heard in a long time.

‘With Tornados, doing commitments in Afghanistan, Iraq and against jihadists in Nigeria, it just didn’t add up to cut one of the squadrons. It would have really put Britain’s ability to sustain operations at risk.

‘The cuts were not done on any sensible or logical basis. It was a case of the Government saying, “Let’s take a risk on what capabilities we’ll need” and that risk has caught up with us.’

Last week, Air Chief Marshall Sir Michael : ‘The lack of combat aircraft is a major weakness.’

The UK only has three Tornado squadrons – two assigned to Afghanistan – and II Squadron, from RAF Marham, Norfolk, have played a pivotal role in the UK’s contribution to the US-led coalition’s operations against IS.

Mr Cameron was forced to delay scrapping two Tornado squadrons at the time of the air campaign over Libya in 2011.

The two-seater Tornado carries a variety of fire power that includes Paveway 500lb, 1,000lb and 2,000lb bombs to target small compounds, Storm Shadow bunker busters and supersonic Brimstone missiles that can hit moving targets such as enemy fighters in cars or on motorbikes.

Pressure: The Prime Minister said RAF jets had taken part in a dozen sorties, and had carried out strikes on four of those missions - hitting eight targets and helping push back Islamic State militants

It currently forms the backbone of the RAF’s ground attack capability so it is seen as ‘ideal’ for operations against IS.

IS is said to be stopping large convoys of motorbikes, reducing the number of checkpoints and banning fighters from using Twitter because it could identify locations, exposing them to attack by the Tornado.

Operating from the giant RAF Akrotiri, the Tornados have been hunting down moving IS targets over northern Iraq having switched from its earlier reconnaissance and surveillance operations..

Defence chiefs had planned II Squadron would be reformed with Typhoon aircraft and based in RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland.

The squadron dates back to 1912 and has a proud history that includes supporting troops in the trenches in World War 1, overflying the D-Day beaches at low level, both Gulf Wars, the Balkans, Libya and Afghanistan.

It is expected to take another three years before the Typhoon has been cleared to fire Brimstone and all the full weapons payload that the Tornado, which is due to leave service in 2019, can currently deliver.

Britain currently has just seven combat-capable air squadrons, compared to 15 for the French air force.
