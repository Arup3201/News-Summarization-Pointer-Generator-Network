A Missouri man who vanished over the summer after leaving suicide notes has been found alive and accused of trying to cover up child sex abuse.

Raymond Avett, 45, was charged Wednesday with concealing a felony along with his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Callaway, 34, the mother of the 6-year-old victim.

Avett disappeared in June after leaving several letters suggesting that he was planning to end his life. He had recently learned that Callaway's daughter disclosed the alleged sexual abuse.

Heinous crime: A relative came to Callaway saying that he had discovered a diary written by her 6-year-old daughter stating that Avett had performed a sex act on her

The suspect was not located until mid-July when he was stopped by police in Maryland. Police say he cashed out more than $100,000 from a retirement account,St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

Callaway allegedly forced Avett to give her his home, luxury SUV, boat and life insurance policy naming the child as beneficiary in exchange for her silence.

The suspected sex abuse came to light in late May when a family member told Callaway that he had discovered a diary written by her 6-year-old daughter, in which the girl mentioned that Avett had allegedly performed a sex act on her.

Following the revelation, the mother moved out of Avett's home, but never reported the alleged sex crime against her daughter.

Three weeks later, investigators say Callaway texted her ex-boyfriend that she was going to send him a document he needed to sign within 48 hours to prevent her from going to the authorities.

Property: Callaway moved into Avett's $120,000 condo in the 3000 block of Flatboat Station

The letter, which Avett received later that day, detailed Callaway’s' demands, stating that her ex-boyfriend must give up his $120,000 condo in the 3000 block of Flatboat Station, his H3 Hummer and his boat called ‘Anita Cocktail.’

Elaborate ruse: Avett vanished in June after leaving behind several suicide notes and abandoning his car by the river, but turned up alive in Maryland three weeks later

As part of the deal, the 45-year-old 
suspected molester also had to take out a life insurance policy that 
would benefit the 6-year-old girl in case of his death.

Avett complied, promptly moving out of his house and handing over his possessions to Callaway June 17.

The following day, the man vanished, leaving behind several suicide notes, one of which was found by police inside his Ford Explorer strategically parked near the riverfront.

Police had spent three weeks searching for the missing man, increasingly believing he had taken his own life, until he turned up in Maryland July 12.

St. Charles County Prosecutor Tim Lohmar said that Avett is not facing child sex abuse charges because his ex-girlfriend had failed to report the alleged crime, making it virtually impossible to get to the bottom of the case.

The prosecutor explained that they have no concrete evidence proving that the abuse had taken place beside Avett's apparent willingness to go along with Callaway’s extortion.

Avett was ordered held on $250,000 cash bail, while Callaway's bail was set at $200,000.
