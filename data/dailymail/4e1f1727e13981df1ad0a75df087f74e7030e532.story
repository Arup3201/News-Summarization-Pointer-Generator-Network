When the largest home in Wisconsin went to auction last year, its sellers must have thought they had a real zinger on their hands.

But fast forward 12 months, and Ellison Bay Manor, in picturesque Door County, is still on the market.

Perhaps given the state of the sluggish US economy, an $8.75million (Â£5.4m) price tag is too much for even the wealthiest prospective buyers.

For that money, they'd get a mansion with three grand guest suites, 10 bathrooms, and a massive 5,000sq ft master suite.

Larger than the average American home, the master suite alone has two dressing rooms, two bathrooms, a sitting room and a fitness room - which can even be reached by elevator.

Last October, the 43-room property - which has been empty for almost a decade - was known as Sur la Baie and was put up for sale for $19m

The 35,000 sq ft French-inspired estate, built by Chicago philanthropist Judith Blazer in 1993, is one of the largest single-family residences in the state

The house features a two-storey library designed in the style of the Vanderbilt mansion

Last October, the 43-room property - which has been empty for almost a decade - was known as Sur la Baie and was put up for sale for $19million.

But clearly its new name has not been enough to entice a new owner.

'We had at least half a dozen offers.

'We had some who were fairly interested and basically they indicated that it was really a full-time residence, it was not really a vacation type property and they were not prepared to live year-round in Door,' realtor Kurt Penn told Fox 11.

The 35,000 sq ft French-inspired estate, built by Chicago philanthropist Judith Blazer in 1993, is one of the largest single-family residences in the state.

Ellison Bay Manor is currently owned by realty group Jameson Sotheby International Realty, based in Chicago - who have managed the property for six years

The house even has its own big screen movie theater complete with concessions stand and ticket booth

The house also features sitting rooms, an entire wing dedicated to a pool and spa including tropical plants, and a floor made of Jerusalem quarry stone

The house was sold to an unnamed couple from California in 2005, but the pair became ill before they could move in and never lived there

Blazer built the house to mimic 19th century homes on the East Coast.

She sold the house to an unnamed couple from California in 2005, but the pair became ill before they could move in and never lived in the house.

Ellison Bay Manor is currently owned by realty group Jameson Sotheby International Realty, based in Chicago - who have managed the property for six years.

The new deal includes the beach house, guest house and 80 acres of land.

Penn said that the owners will pay the first five years of real estate tax, and will also donate 4 per cent of the sale proceeds to charities such as the Door County Humane Society, Midsummer Music Festival, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and another charity chosen by the buyer.

Given the downturn in the real estate market since that 2005 sale, real estate agents expect buyers with enough cash on hand could make a killing on the sale.

Last year, Hilco Real Estate Michael Fine described the house as a mixture of classic style and modern amenities with a breathtaking view of Green Bay.

'Spiral staircase, leaded glass stained window,' Fine said. 'An entrance from the balcony above into the owner's bedroom.'

The house also features a two-storey library designed in the style of the Vanderbilt mansion, sitting rooms, and an entire wing dedicated to a pool and spa including tropical plants, a floor made of Jerusalem quarry stone, and several waterfalls including one connecting to a 14-person whirlpool.

The indoor pool also includes its own fully-functional kitchen, guest locker room, steam shower and bathroom.

The house even has its own big screen movie theater complete with concessions stand and ticket booth.

Realtors told Fox that the problems in the housing market are not limited to shifting huge mansions. Less expensive holiday homes, such as another valued at around $1.5million has also proved hard to sell.

'This is probably an average upscale vacation home in Door County. It's been for sale this time for about seven months,' said Scott Bader, from Coldwell Banker.

'Right now I think there are only about 40 to 45 for sale. So that's a fairly long market time.'

Scott Bader, who specialises in homes valued at more than $1 million, said just seven such properties have been sold annually in the county.

Ellison Bay Manor has been rented out for private events but is classed as residential, so cannot be converted into a hotel.
