Neanderthals lost out to Homo sapiens in the battle to survive because they were not clever enough to adapt.

The results of a five-year study, to be revealed this week, will show that modern man walked the planet much earlier than was believed and Neanderthals died out much sooner than was estimated.

The brains of Neanderthals were the same size as those of modern man but more of it was used to focus on the physical needs of their larger bodies.

Extinction: Neanderthal man had larger eyes but did not develop his brain power like Homo sapiens

Modern humans from Africa evolved the 
part of their brains responsible for thinking, which they used to 
connect  with other groups in times of need.

When the Ice Age came, they
could speak a complex language and set up operations far from their 
homes, unlike Neanderthals.

Europe was once dominated by 
Neanderthals, but they disappeared after modern man was thought to have 
emerged 60,000 years ago.

Now, according to the research programme Reset
–Response of Humans to abrupt environmental transitions – Homo sapiens 
could have arrived 45,000 years ago.

Scientists using radiocarbon dating 
discovered there appeared to be no Neanderthal sites 39,000 years ago 
–10,000 years earlier than previous thought.

Homo sapiens could have arrived 45,000 years ago. Five thousand years later, Neanderthals had all but vanished.

The results of the research will be 
unveiled at a three-day conference titled When Europe was covered by Ice
and Ash, at the British Museum in London.
