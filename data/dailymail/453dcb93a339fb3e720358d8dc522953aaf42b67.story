Perry was drawn to Finland Middle School after seeing an HBO segment about teacher Mary Mulvany, who started a foundation to raise scholarship money for athletics and extra-curricular activities.

The Ohio school district received 
national attention last year when their funding was cut after voters 
failed to pass a tax in 2009.

The levy was later passed, but the after-school activities were only brought back at a pay-to-participate fee, which many of the district's families could not afford, local ABC News Channel 6 reports.

In response to the fiscal crisis Mulvany started the Success Beyond the Classroom foundation, which raises scholarship funds to cover fees of up to $500 per family.

Perry, who is best known for playing Madea, a sassy strong-willed grandmother, tried to inspire hope in the assembled group of middle schoolers.

He told the excited students and 
staff that he was moved by their plight and wants to give opportunities 
to as many students as he can.

'I just wanted to see your faces and say
hi to you because you all inspire me so much,' Perry said to the crowd 
of excited children.

Perry told the students that sympathized with their financial and emotional struggles, relaying tales of his days growing up poor in New Orleans and being bullied in school.

He went on to encourage them and stress the importance of a good education.

'Hundreds of kids will be helped by what he did today,' Mulvany told The Columbia Dispatch, describing Perry's actions as kind and unselfish.

The actor asked Mulvany to keep him informed about the school's progress and the children's lives.

'That is so much hope and joy and love in that room,' Perry told the paper with his arm around a beaming Mulvany, 'And what is so exciting about them all is that they all have a story.'

'I think children are sometimes pushed aside, but the stories in that room can move a mountain,' he said.
