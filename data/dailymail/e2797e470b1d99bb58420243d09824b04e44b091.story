She's made the transition from WAG to fully-fledged style icon and now Abbey Clancy is cashing in on her penchant for dressing up.

The model and Strictly Come Dancing winner has unveiled her fourth collection for high street store Matalan - and models every piece herself.

Proving that she is more than just a pretty face, the mother-of-one designed the range from scratch based on her personal style and says it's her 'edgiest' collection to date.

She's back! Abbey Clancy has unveiled her fourth range for high street store Matalan and promises there's something for everyone in the run up to the Christmas party season (dress, £40)

According to the model, the nine new additions to her collection will offer something new to fans, desperate for a stylish festive wardrobe.

There's plenty of the one-shoulder dresses the 28-year-old loves to wear herself plus more casual styles such as leather trousers and mesh crop tops.

She's gone to new lengths: Abbey's range is full of the short skirts she loves to wear herself and she shows off her model body in the new campaign images (£40)

Figure-hugging: Abbey, who designed the range herself based on her own style, has included the fitted dresses she loves to wear in black and red (£35)

Glamorous: Abbey said she feels this collection offers a style for everyone, for any occasion 

Last season saw her opt for a minimalist black and white palette but this time around, bold reds and softer beiges take centre stage.

In true WAG style, skirts are super short and dresses are figure-hugging, although the black lace number does offer some coverage.

Speaking about her latest collection, Clancy said: 'I am so thrilled about my new range for Matalan. I really wanted to make it festive and offer lots of going out options for the party season.

'I think red is perfect for this time of year and I love the off the shoulder dress in this shade. I think everyone wants to feel glamorous at this time of year, and I feel this collection offers a style for everyone, for any occasion.'

Toned physique: Abbey works out at the gym regularly and showcases the fruits of her labour in this shoot (top, £20)

New addition: For the first time, the collection includes an on-trend jumpsuit in a  feminine pastel hue in a structured shape (£40)

Model and muse: Abbey has become a style icon over the last few years and has been snapped up by countless brands 

Abbey celebrated the launch of her latest range last week. The blonde model and the fashion favourite was at the Celebration Of Style launch at the Liver Birds building in Liverpool.

Strictly winner Abbey has seen her working life go from strength-to-strength in recent months - much to the model's surprise.

‘I haven't really had a plan with my career, I've just done whatever's come my way and enjoyed it, she revealed in a recent interview.'

Party perfect: Abbey describes her fourth range as her edgiest collection to date for Matalan in time for the Christmas party season (£35)
