A former Brookside star told a jury yesterday that he was snorting cocaine in his car while his passenger gunned down a nightclub bouncer in an alleged underworld assassination.

Brian Regan, 54, who played Terry Sullivan for 14 years in the Channel 4 soap, was explaining how he was unwittingly used as a getaway driver in the killing.

He and co-accused Lee Dodson, 42, Edward Heffey, 40, and Simon Smart, 33, all deny murdering Bahman Faraji, 44, on the orders of an unnamed man who had a bitter dispute with the victim.

Giving his defence at Liverpool Crown
Court, divorced father-of-three Regan said he became addicted to 
cocaine while working on Brookside.

He started taking it in 1992 at 
weekends when he was not filming and it soon escalated. ‘Eventually the 
drug got hold of me and I was constantly taking cocaine,’ he said.

Regan claimed he met drug dealer Lee 
Dodson almost 20 years ago and started assisting him with drug 
deliveries to feed his own habit.

The court heard that on February 24 
this year, the day of the murder, Regan was ferrying drugs to Edward 
Heffey, a regular client of Dodson, when Heffey asked him for a lift.

Regan said: ‘He said he wanted to 
meet someone who owed him money so that he could give me the money that 
he owed Lee for the drugs.

‘During the trip I know he received some calls but I wasn’t really paying attention, I was concentrating on driving.

‘Eddie got out and said he would be 
back in a minute. He walked towards the back of the car and disappeared.
I didn’t see a gun. I had a line of cocaine while I waited in the car 
then he returned after about three or four minutes. There was absolutely
nothing different about him.

‘He wasn’t covered in blood. He didn’t have a gun. He didn’t seem anxious or flustered. He asked me to drop him home and I did.’

Iranian Bahman, a father of one also 
known as ‘Batman’ or ‘Ben’, was shot in the face as he waited to meet 
someone at the Belgrave pub, in Aigburth, Liverpool.

Prosecutor Brian Cummings QC had 
earlier alleged that Regan, on the orders of Dodson, drove Heffey to and
from the shooting, while Smart lured the victim to the murder scene 
using his mobile phone.

Mr Cummings said: ‘Heffey was the 
gunman who actually shot the victim and Brian Regan, by arrangement with
Dodson, drove Heffey to and from the scene of the shooting, fully aware
of the purpose of Heffey’s trip.

‘Smart orchestrated the murder from a
safe distance, making telephone calls to the victim on the one hand and
Heffey on the other to make sure the victim was in the right place at 
the right time.’

Mr Cummings said Regan told police: 
‘I done nothing wrong and I didn’t do anything willingly. I want to help
you but I’ll be shot.’

Regan and Dodson, of Garston, Smart, of Halewood, and Heffey, of Dingle, all in Liverpool, deny murder.

Regan and his girlfriend Christine Line, 49, are charged with perverting the course of justice.

The jury has been told that Regan has admitted supplying class A drugs and will be sentenced at the end of the trial.
