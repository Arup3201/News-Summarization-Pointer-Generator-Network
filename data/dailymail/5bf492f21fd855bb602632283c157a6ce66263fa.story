The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has confirmed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is not in the southern Indian Ocean search zone where pings were detected in early April.

A statement from the Joint Agency Co-ordination Center search team said on Thursday: 'The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete.

'And in its professional judgment, the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370.'

The US Navy said there was no evidence to suggest the four detected pings, which were used to base the search area, were from the plane's black boxes.

And no debris from MH370 has been found during the extensive search.

Families of the passengers and crew on board the flight, including the New Zealand wife of passenger Paul Weeks, have been left shattered by the news.

'It is just another slap in the face. It's just another long road for us and look, I'm just shattered by the news. I'm absolutely shattered,' Danica Weeks told Sydney Morning Herald from her Perth home.

Authorities agree the four pings found in early April are not from the MH370's black box

US Navy ocean engineering deputy director Michael Dean, said it was most likely the pings came from another man-made object such as one of the ships that were looking for the plane, reported CNN.

'Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator,' Mr Dean told CNN.

'Always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out, that you could start producing sound.'

Those looking for the plane used the pinger locator to listen for underwater signals.

The MH370 flight and its 239 passengers disappeared on March 8, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Mr Dean said searchers would have discovered the black boxes if the pings had been coming from them.

He also indicated other countries involved in the search had come to the same conclusion - that the pings found seven weeks ago were not from the flight's data or cockpit voice recorders.

But he said he could not completely rule out that the noises came from the black boxes.

The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre announced on April 7 that a pinger locator towed from the Australian navy vessel Ocean Shield had picked up two acoustic signals, with one held for more than two hours.

The signals were described as consistent with flight data or cockpit voice recorders and at the time became the most solid lead and likely from a man-made source.

The man charged with finding the plane, Angus Houston, said it was 'the most promising lead' to date.

Two days later, two more signals were detected and held for about five and seven minutes.

Australia ended its initial stage of the underwater search on Wednesday, finishing its scan of large areas surrounding the four ping sites.

The Bluefin-21 mission came to an end after the underwater drone did not detect any aircraft debris from the time it began scanning the sea floor off the West Australian coast on April 14.

The drone scoured more than 850 square kilometres of ocean floor in its search for signs of the missing aircraft.

The Bluefin-21, an underwater vehicle, was unable to look in the area where the most northern ping was located because of deep waters.

Australian navy fleets, including the HMAS Stirling (pictured), have been assisting in the search, which will not ramp up again for at least two months while new equipment is moved to a new search area

With the pings used to determine the search area almost ruled out, the JACC will now expand its search while also reviewing all existing radar, satellite and aircraft performance data.

This will help define a search zone of up to 60,000 square kilometres in the southern Indian Ocean, which still follows an arc defined by British company Inmarsat based on the final 'handshakes' between the Boeing 777 and satellites.

Relatives of the 239 passengers and crew were recently successful in demanding Inmarsat publicly release its data, after loosing faith that searchers were looking in the right area.

JACC said the findings of the data review would be made public in due course.

As well as sea floor mapping in the defined search area, more vessels will be added to the survey, expected to take about three months.

A new and potentially deeper underwater search taking up to 12 months will follow in August, with a formal request for tender to undertake the search to soon be released, according to JACC.

'A single prime contractor will be chosen to bring together and manage the expertise, equipment and vessels to carry out the search,' the centre said.

Australian Transportation Safety Board's Martin Dolan said it would take more time to move new equipment within the search area, which is about 60,000 square kilometres.

Danica Weeks, pictured with sons Jack, 13 months old and Lincoln, 3, is struggling with news searchers have given up on the area where pings were detected

The New Zealand wife of a passenger on ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight 370 said she is having trouble coming to terms with news that searchers have given up on an area of the Indian Ocean where acoustic pings were detected.

Danica Weeks' husband Paul, a mechanical engineer, boarded MH370 on his way to start a new job in Mongolia.

Mrs Weeks lives is in Perth, where the family moved after the Christchurch earthquakes in 2011.

'When your child cries for their father, it just breaks your heart and I can't tell them the truth because I don't know,' she told the Seven Network.

'I still haven't reconciled that he's not coming back, because I've had nothing.

'When you don't have anything - not even a piece of the plane, just nothing, and so many different stories - how can you not have a little piece of hope?'

'It is just another slap in the face. It's just another long road for us and look, I'm just shattered by the news. I'm absolutely shattered,' she told Sydney Morning Herald.

The couple have two boys, Lincoln, 3, and 13-month-old Jack.

Transport Minister Warren Truss has told federal parliament the search is moving into a new phase and Australia was committed to doing everything it can to find the plane.

'We are still very confident that the resting place of the aircraft is in the Southern Ocean,' he said. 'Unfortunately this is a painstaking effort in a very large ocean.'

Mr Truss said the next search area could be 800 kilometres long and 70km wide.

Manager of opposition business Tony Burke said families of the those on the missing plane had been left hanging after the most recent search failed to the plane.

'Once again we offer our condolences and words of comfort to the families and friends of the passengers on MH370 who still await more news,' he said.
