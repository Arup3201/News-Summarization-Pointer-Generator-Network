The last words of a three-year-old girl who was taken to the emergency room covered in bruises and bite marks were, ‘Papa, I hate you,’ according to court documents.

Carmen Ellis, a beaming little girl with big brown eyes, was taken off life support Wednesday after succumbing to her injuries.

Jose Cruz, the boyfriend of Carmen Ellis’ mother, told investigators that he lost his temper with the girl, beating the toddler repeatedly with a belt and shaking her, the documents read.

Cruz said that he ‘blanked out’ and ‘lost it’ after Carmen began vomiting, according to the documents obtained by Indystar.com.

Her mother, Samantha Ellis, told 
investigators that Cruz insisted her daughter would heal on her own and 
did not want to take her to the hospital.

He is charged with murder, and will next appear in court in November. Until then, he is being held in solitary confinement.

Police received a call on Tuesday to go to Long Wharf Drive in Warren Woods, Indiana, about 13 miles outside Indianapolis.

According to WISH-TV, that’s when police discovered little Carmen in a bedroom with her mother, limp and allegedly covered head-to-toe in bruises.

The girl was rushed to the hospital and put on life support.

She was kept alive until Wednesday so her organs could be donated, Indystar.com reported.

Officers found Cruz in the house wearing a sopping wet T-shirt and looking crazed.

This isn’t Cruz’s first brush-in with authorities. In July, a concerned neighbour called the police last month, reporting possible bite marks on the girl’s face.

However, the case was handed over to Child Services.

Carmen’s grandmother, Tina Ellis, told WISH-TV: ‘Carmen is a beautiful three year old girl. She is smart, very smart.’

Authorities said Carmen’s mother is currently not facing charges, but could, based on what officers find in their on-going investigation.
