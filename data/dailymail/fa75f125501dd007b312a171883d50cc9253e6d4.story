Nearly four years after the body of Ethan Stacy was found buried on a mountainside in Utah, the child’s stepfather — Nathan Sloop — admitted Tuesday that he played a role in the four-year-old’s death.

Sloop, 35, pleaded guilty but mentally ill to aggravated murder for the 2010 death of Ethan Stacy, who was found near Powder Mountain in Weber Country with his face disfigured by hammer blows and his grave sprinkled with dog food.

Sloop was immediately sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the murder and 1 to 15 years for aggravated assault by a prisoner for attacking a David County jail officer.

A number of other charges were dismissed as part of a plea deal, which also spared him from the death penalty, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.

Sloop told the judge that his state of mind was 'reckless indifference' in the months before Ethan’s death.

Attorneys said that while Sloop was mentally ill at the time Ethan died, he is no longer mentally ill.

'That boy died on my watch, and I’m horribly sorry,' Nathan Sloop told 2nd District Judge Glen Dawson, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.

He said he wanted to plead guilty on Tuesday to accept responsibility for his actions.

'I want to apologize to all those who were affected by my reckless indifference to Ethan Stacy,' Sloop said.

Sloop’s attorney, Richard Mauro, said his client’s mental illness coupled with a high number of prescription painkillers and other medications Sloop was taking at the time led to his indifference to the child’s life.

Previous court documents show Sloop was prescribed 4,146 pills in an 11-month period.

Among the prescriptions were Lortab, Valium, Percocet, Xanax and an antihistamine.

Davis County Attorney Troy Rawlings told Dawson on Tuesday that while Ethan’s father, Joe Stacy, was in the courtroom, he was too emotional to make a statement before the sentence was handed down.

'It was a very traumatic experience for them to come on a plane and come to Utah,' Rawlings said of Joe Stacy and his wife, who live in Virginia.

'He felt the need and desire and the want to be here for his son.'

Rawlings told the judge that the plea negotiation minimizes the risk of appeal.

Ethan's mother, Stephanie Sloop, is awaiting trial for her alleged role in the murder.

Nathan Sloop’s defense attorney Richard Mauro said Ethan Stacy died of an accidental overdose of a number of over-the-counter medications.

A medical examiner testified that Ethan died from a combination of too many over-the-counter medications, aspiration pneumonia and severe burns, likely caused from hot water in a tub.

Aspiration pneumonia is caused by an inhalation of foreign materials into the lungs, potentially vomit, or as prosecutors suggested, fecal matter that the boy allegedly was forced to eat, according to prior police testimony.     

The burns would have required skin grafts and weeks of hospital treatment, doctors said.

Nathan Sloop confessed to wrapping the body in garbage bags.

Ethan's body was taken to an area near Powder Mountain on May 8, where a deep hole was dug.

The boy’s body and items used to bury it were put in the hole in layers.

A hammer was used to disfigure the boy.

'Stephanie was worried about his dental records,' Nathan Sloop allegedly told detectives in a transcript read aloud in court.

Detective Roderick testified that Stephanie Sloop went to a market in Eden, Utah, and purchased lighter fluid, as surveillance video was broadcast to the court.

Prosecutors also showed surveillance video of her purchasing a shovel and some gloves at a hardware store.

Dog food was also placed around the grave.

The day the boy was buried, Nathan Sloop sent a text message to his wife, which was shown in court:  'Baby can you get antioxidant vitamins please. That would be great. I can’t wait to take you to Happy Sumo. Memories. Love you!!!'

Days later, they called police and reported Ethan as missing.

Nathan Sloop ultimately led police to where the boy was buried.
