A heartwarming video shows Kibo the super-cute Shiba Inu puppy learning exactly how to respond should he ever have a run in with the police and be ordered to 'spread 'em'.

The footage shows the five-month-old pooch leaping up on his hind legs and leaning against the nearest wall or surface when his owner says the command and pretends to point a gun at him.

With paws splayed, the adorable pup then stares expectantly at his owner Jon Sun, mimicking the pose of an arrested person waiting to be frisked by the police.

The pooch is then offered a treat for his acting efforts.

Kibo is seen spreading his little paws against stone walls, the fridge, kitchen cupboards, a tree and even his owner's car, although Jon reassures viewers that the pup didn't even scratch it.

The cute video from the States has already racked up close to 400,000 views on YouTube, where Jon has posted several videos of the clever puppy on his page. 

Kibo fans can watch the pooch learning to sing as he sits on the sofa and howls along while Jon plays the guitar. Another video shows the adorable Shiba Inu puppy giving his owner high-fives.
