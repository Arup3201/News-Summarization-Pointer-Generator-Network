The BBC has been attacked over its decision to send 95 staff to cover the Sochi Winter Olympics, nearly double the number of Team GB athletes.

The corporation will send 95 staff including radio, online and news reporters 
to the event, 21 more than it sent to the 2010 Vancouver Games.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The BBC needs to stop wasting the licence fee on over-staffing events.

The BBC has been criticised for sending 95 staff to cover the Winter Olympics, nearly double the number of GB athletes going to compete and 21 more than last time

'The Beeb consistently sends too many staff to the big events. With this many staff at the games, each athlete will probably have their own personal correspondent.'

The BBC has defended itself, saying that its coverage of the 16-day Games will be 20 per cent longer than before, with 200 hours of programming to be broadcast.

Team GB athletes will aim to win three medals at sports including the skeleton - aka the 'tea tray' - where Lizzy Yarnold, 25, and 32-year-old Shelley Rudman are among the favorites to win.

Eve Muirhead, 23, is also hotly tipped in the women's curling after leading Scotland to victory in the world cup in March.

GB also has hopes of winning in the freestyle skiing, speed skating, bobsleigh and snowboarding.

Britain's best ever tally at the event is four medals, won at the inaugural ceremony in 1924.

Meanwhile Team GB are sending 50 athletes to compete, including Craig Pickering, Ben Simons, John Baines and Lamin Deen (pictured left to right)

The Sochi Games will start on Friday in Russia, where officials hope to avoidÂ  some of the controversy and security fears that have built up before the event.

The country has been condemned by gay rights activists for passing a law banning 'homosexual propaganda' which critics say has led to a spate of homophobic attacks.

Celebrities such as Stephen Fry have asked nations to boycott the events, and while athletes will be attending, many foreign leaders such as David Cameron and Barack Obama will not be going.

Volunteers are now completing the final stage of preparations ahead of the Games which start on Friday

Some athletes, including the German speed skating team, are already practicing in the venues in Russia

Security fears have also plagued the run-up, with Chechen rebels threatening suicide bombing attacks throughout the Games, with British athletes warned not to wear their uniforms while arriving in case they are targeted.

Leaflets were also issued last week showing the face of a suspected female 'black widow' terrorist, the wife of a dead rebel, who was thought to be in Sochi and planning an attack.
