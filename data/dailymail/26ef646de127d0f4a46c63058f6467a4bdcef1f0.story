Telling your children they are pretty or handsome hardly seems like bad parenting.

But from today, the Government will urge mothers and fathers not to praise their children for their looks or their size – or to talk about their own weight worries.

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone has launched a 12-page guide aimed at tackling youngsters’ body hang-ups.

It warns parents that comments about weight and body shape, as well as airbrushed images of celebrities, are damaging children’s self-esteem.

changes: The guide shows how images of pop singer Britney Spears have been altered

A series of practical tips for ‘promoting a healthy body image’ urges parents to look at magazines and TV adverts with their children and point out where images are likely to have been digitally enhanced.

They are also told to refrain from praising prettiness or thinness, comparing youngsters to celebrities or teasing them about their weight.

In further advice, which is likely to trigger claims of fuelling the nanny state, the online guide advises parents to ‘try not to complain about parts of your body you don’t like’.

‘Although it is difficult to feel confident about your body all the time, by appearing to be neutral or positive about your own appearance, you will be helping your child to develop their own body confidence,’ the pack says.

The guide also warns that youngsters – particularly girls – risk developing low self-esteem and possible mental health problems if they believe that touched-up images of models and celebrities are real.

It features before-and-after shots of celebrities including Britney Spears, Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys Meyers to show how airbrushing and other techniques can significantly change their appearance.

Warning: The guide quotes a study by Girl Guiding UK which found that 75 per cent of 11 to 21-year-old girls go on diets to look more attractive

Warning against teasing or highlighting physical features, the guide says: ‘Even seemingly friendly nicknames can be hurtful if they focus on some aspect of the child’s appearance.’

But parents shouldn’t ‘feel scared to praise the physical attributes that make your child unique, whether they are tall, short, narrow or wide’.

If a child complains ‘I’m fat’, parents should ‘discuss body diversity and how the beauty ideals they may be relating to lack diversity’.

'Bright and bubbly': Fiona Geraghty, 14, was found hanged in her home last year

Mrs Featherstone, a mother of two, 
developed the guide in conjunction with Media Smart, a non-profit media 
literacy programme for six to 11-year-olds.

 11 to 21-year-old girls go on diets to look more attractive.

Its launch comes only days after a coroner blamed the fashion industry and its obsession with ‘wafer thin’ models for the death of a ‘bright and bubbly’ 14-year-old public schoolgirl.

Fiona Geraghty was found hanged in her home last year after suffering from bulimia.

Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, held the fashion industry ‘directly responsible’.

‘I ask for magazines in the fashion industry to stop publishing photographs of wafer thin girls. For their vanity, families like this suffer,’ he said.

The guide describes how modern technology has enabled advertisers to create ‘unrealistic’ images, using airbrushing to make skin look clear and flawless, and to make models appear thinner.’

Unless they are aware of those techniques, they will set themselves ‘unrealistic and unattainable goals of beauty,’ it adds.

Mrs Featherstone said: ‘Young people are being set an impossible standard by images in media and advertising which can erode their self esteem.

‘As parents, we are often aware of these issues, but may not have the advice and guidance we need to talk to our children.

‘I want the pack to empower parents to have those difficult conversations.’
