A mother stole $4,000 from the bank account of her son while he was on tour with the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan for six months, police said.

Paula Barker, 43, of Ormond Beach, Florida, allegedly bought a plane ticket and sent herself cash through money wire service Western Union.

Chadwick Barker, 20, was fighting abroad from February to September last year and returned home to find the money missing from his account.

He called the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office in October to say he thought his mother could be involved, reported the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

His mother got hold of the account information before he left and used it to steal the funds between July and September last year, police said.

She was arrested at her home on Tuesday evening on a warrant which charged her with fraudulent use of personal identification details.

‘An investigation by the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the Marine’s fears, resulting in the arrest of Paula,’ a sheriff’s spokesman said.

The spokesman added that Mr Barker was ‘shocked’ to discover the alleged theft and believing it was his mother just ‘made matters worse’.

Ms Barker had previously denied knowing about the lost account funds when she was questioned by investigators last November, police said.

But authorities got together enough evidence for Volusia County Judge Robert Sanders Jr to sign an arrest warrant, reported the Orlando Sentinel.

Ms Barker was locked up in the Volusia County Branch Jail in Daytona Beach, Florida, on $5,000 bond after she was arrested without incident.
