James Coleman, 18, of Netherton, Liverpool, and another boy scrawled the vile comments just a few hours after  Erick Maina's body was found

A teenager who daubed racist graffiti on a memorial to Liverpool schoolboy Erick Maina just hours after he died has been jailed for two years.

James Coleman, 18, of Netherton, Liverpool, and another boy scrawled the vile comments just a few hours after Kenyan-born Erick's body was found. 

Coleman and a 17-year-old, who cannot be named, made references to 'white power', supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan and painted swastikas at Erick's school, Maricourt High in Southport, and nearby Balls Wood Park,

He also wrote: 'Nothing better than a n***** dead'. 

Police are not treating Erick's death as suspicious and an inquest has not yet been held.

Erick's grieving father told a court the vile graffiti 'was like rubbing salt in our open wounds'.

Erick, an aspiring doctor who raised money for cancer charities, was found at his family home in Fazakerley, Liverpool, on November 15 just hours after posting 'bye' on his Facebook account. 

Liverpool Crown Court heard Coleman and his partner-in-crime struck after hundreds of Erick's friends gathered at the school as news of his death spread on social networking sites.

Maricourt headteacher Brendan McLoughlin had opened the school for pupils to sign a book of condolence while school friends also began their own tribute, posting flowers and notes to a fence on the site.

A victim impact statement from Erick's father Stephen was read out in court.

He said: 'Having lost my wonderful son, the damage that these boys did was like rubbing salt in our open wounds. 

A teenager who daubed racist graffiti on a memorial to Liverpool schoolboy Erick Maina, 15, (pictured) just hours after he died has been jailed for two years - another boy, aged 17, has been locked up for 10 months.

'I have no understanding of why anyone would want to hurt a family further by doing such an act of malicious hate.

'The words and the graffiti was all so hurtful and it did not just hurt my family, but our wider Kenyan community. We have all been shocked by this incident.

'To a degree, I have ignored the press coverage of this incident because I could not have been hurt any more. I had lost my son, I was at rock bottom, nothing could cause me further pain.

'What these boys did was a very bad thing and I believe it is a good thing that they are getting punished for their mistakes because we must learn from our mistakes. That is so important.

'When Erick died, the community that I live with and all Erick's friends at school and around this area poured out pure love and kindness towards our family in our time of need. This is what has supported our family and helped us deal with this further pain.

'The love and kindness was tremendous and shows us just how highly thought of our son was within this community and at school.

'These two boys are not much older than Erick and for whatever reason they decided to do what they did and in doing so I believe they have destroyed their lives.

'Erick loved all people, no matter what their colour or background, and people of all backgrounds loved Erick in return.

'I would like these boys to get as much help as possible to become better citizens and to learn to love and respect all people the way my wonderful son Erick did.'

Crown prosecutor Chris Taylor said: 'Swastikas had been painted across windows, brickwork and the bonnet of one of the cars belonging to a sister employed at the school.

'This court will appreciate the power of that misused symbol in terms of reflecting the very worst that humanity is capable of towards minority communities.

'References are also seen in relation to 'KKK' and 'white power', both terms of extreme hatred to-wards the non-white members of this community.

'The hatred shown by the defendants is expressively summed up by the references to 'n*****' and 'Eric was a black n*****'

Erick's grieving father told Liverpool Crown Court the vile graffiti 'was like rubbing salt in our open wounds'

'Even the students' memorial did not escape their hatred and vandalism. On the footpath was painted 'n*****' with an arrow pointing towards the flowers and cards.'

James Smith, defending, said: 'One runs out of adjectives to describe his behaviour.

'All he can say through me is that he is very, very sorry for what he has done.'

The court heard that Coleman, who has a string of previous convictions, including criminal damage, burglary and theft, has since written a letter of apology to Erick's family.

Judge Mr Recorder Stuart Driver told Coleman: 'There was bigotry in every stroke of your brush.

'This was racism writ large, it was a public display of vile bitterness.

'The great majority of the public will be profoundly shocked by it.

'It was also an act which caused great insult and pain to a small family which had suffered its bereavement on the very same day.' 

He said: 'Erick was loved by his family and their loss is incalculable.

'He was spontaneously mourned by hundreds of people who attended his school for an impromptu show of support.

'What you did in response to that was to go to the supermarket and buy paint and a brush.'

The judge added: 'It is not the value of the damage that's the central part of this case. 

'The things that you wrote were deeply offensive. I need not use adjectives to describe them, simply reading them out will allow them to speak for themselves.'

Coleman admitted two charges of racially aggravated criminal damage and asked for a further offence to be taken into consideration.

Mr Recorder Driver sentenced Coleman to two years in youth detention. The 17-year-old boy was convicted to 10 months in detention by a youth court last week.
