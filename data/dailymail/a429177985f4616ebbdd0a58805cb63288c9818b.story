A Scottish student has launched a worldwide holidaymaker hunt after he found a camera memory card packed with pictures of a trip across Scotland.

Barry Carruthers, 22, a drama student, found a grimy memory card in front of a multi-storey car park in Glasgow.

The card still worked and was filled with pictures of a family taken at Scotland's most iconic sights.

Mr Carruthers has launched a campaign on several social media sites and hopes to reunite the family with their memory card.

The family snaps include the travellers at iconic locations across Scotland, including the capital

The message has gone global with big-hearted social media users from Shetland to Hong Kong banding together to help find the family.

US TV host Ellen DeGeneres has even been contacted on Twitter by eager fans hoping she will spread the word.

Mr Carruthers uploaded the images onto his laptop and kick-started a global search for the mystery holidaymakers to Scotland.

Mr Carruthers is appealing to anyone who recognises the family to help him reunite them with their snaps

He said: 'This family had been everywhere, and done it all.

'They went to the Military Tattoo at Edinburgh Castle, the Fringe, the Royal Mile, Knockhill Circuit, Ayr - you name it.

'I've lived in Scotland all my life, and there were a few places I couldn't even identify.'

After trawling through the family-of-four's all-encompassing epic Scottish trip, Mr Carruthers said he felt compelled to reunite the tourists with their photos. 

The pictures seem to feature a family of four, two parents and their son and daughter

He said: 'I'm quite a sentimental person myself, and I just hated the idea of this family losing their entire trip on the street.

'When people pick up cameras or phones, all they are thinking of is the monetary value - but I don't think people ever stop to realise how powerful and important photographs are to people.

'I just really wanted to help.'

A keen photographer, Mr Carruthers was able to identify that the family had used a Nikon camera for their shots and had travelled to Scotland in August.

Mr Carruthers has been tireless in his efforts - contacting Nikon to see if the camera was registered in order to trace the family, as well as emailing the hotels seen in the photos.

He added: 'Thank you to every single one of you for sharing.'

The campaign has spread around the world to America and even Hong Kong

Posting on Facebook several photos of the family in front of Edinburgh locations such as North Bridge, his plea for help to find the family has now racked up more 23,000 shares in a matter of days.

His cause was also taken up on BBC radio and national tourist board VisitScotland.

A spokesman for VisitScotland said: 'When we saw that this family had lost all of their photographs, we had to help.

'World-famous for our incredible scenery, vibrant culture and spectacular heritage, Scotland is one of the finest tourism destinations in the world, and a holiday here provides memories that will last a lifetime.

'However, to lose your photographs of this beautiful country would be devastating and we hope that the family in this case will be reunited with their memory card very soon.'

Mr Carruthers added: 'This family clearly had an amazing time in Scotland. They saw it all.

'I just don't want them to lose those memories.'
