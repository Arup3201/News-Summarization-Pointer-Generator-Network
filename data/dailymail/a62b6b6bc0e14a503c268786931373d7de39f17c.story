Brighton have accepted manager Oscar Garcia's offer of resignation following the club's play-off defeat to Derby.

The Seagulls' promotion hopes were dashed following their crushing loss against Steve McClaren's side.

Speaking to the club's official website, Garcia said: 'The club has been aware of my thoughts for several weeks and during this time I have had discussions with both the chairman, Tony Bloom, and chief executive, Paul Barber.

Tough loss: Brighton have accepted manager Oscar Garcia's offer to resign after the play-off defeat to Derby

'I have enjoyed my time with the club but, although I do not have any immediate plans, I have decided to move on.'Iâ€™m
 very proud of this season with Brighton. The Championship is a very 
difficult and competitive league but our record this season has been 
very good. I wish Brighton every success for the future.

It
 is understood Brighton officials had asked the Spaniard to sleep on his
 decision before agreeing to go their separate ways on Monday.

The
 south coast club will now begin the process of looking for a new manager for a second successive 
summer following Gus Poyet's departure after another heartbreaking 
play-off campaign last season.
