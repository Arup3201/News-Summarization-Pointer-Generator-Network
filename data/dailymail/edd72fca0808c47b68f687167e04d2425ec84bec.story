The wife of Seattle attorney Danford Grant, who has been charged in a series of brutal rapes at various massage parlors, has filed a petition for legal separation.

Jennifer Grant filed the petition last week, two months after her 47-year-old husband was arrested in connection to the attacks, according to the Seattle Times.

Danford Grant is charged with attacking five women, including four massage therapists of Asian descent and a cashier at a Seattle massage clinic who he allegedly raped in her car after identifying himself as a police officer, charging papers say.

Grant has been charged with seven felonies in connection to the attacks, including four counts of first-degree rape involving alleged victims in Bellevue, Shoreline and Seattle between June and September, according to charging documents. He is also charged with second-degree rape, attempted second-degree rape and first-degree burglary.

Grant is living at home on house arrest after he posted a $1 million bail for himself.

His wife is seeking a legal separation, meaning the couple will remain married, but divide their assets and debts. The petition also requests child support for the couples' two young children. After six months, either spouse can seek to have the separation converted into a divorce.

Danford Grant was arrested Sept. 24 
near a Greenwood massage clinic, where police say he raped a massage 
therapist at knife point. Some time after the alleged attack, Grant 
showed up at the massage parlor and employees called police.

He fled on foot but police were able to catch him. He was booked into jail early on Sept. 25.

Grant's
psychiatrist has since stopped treating him. The psychiatrist 'does not
feel either comfortable or qualified to continue providing treatment to
Mr. Grant in light of the charges in this case,' Grant's attorney wrote
in a Nov. 2 letter to the court.

Danford and Jennifer Grant were 
married in King County in July 2000. They have two children together, an
8-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy, court records show. He also has a
16-year-old son from a previous relationship, the records say.

Grant accepted his wife's petition and both agreed that their 
separation began Sept. 26, the day after he was booking into jail, 
according to the Seattle Times.

Grant's
wife has show some support for him during the case. She showed up in 
court during his first appearance in September and wrote an Oct. 17 
declaration in support of bail reduction for him.

'Most
importantly, Dan's family, including his mother and siblings, as well 
as me and his three children, are the most important part of his life 
and his reason for existence,' her declaration says. 'He would never 
consider leaving his family, and he desperately needs to be united with 
us all.'

Danford Grant is a litigation partner at the Seattle law firm Bailey Grant Onsager and has worked at the Seattle City Attorneyâ€™s Office.

A graduate of the University of Washington School of Law, Grant has handled appeals at the Washington Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, according to his website.
