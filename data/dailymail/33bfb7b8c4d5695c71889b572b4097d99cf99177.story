One lucky Californian is about to become an instant millionaire after buying a Powerball ticket with all six matching numbers.

The jackpot for the lottery grew to $400million, the sixth-largest in history, when the numbers 1, 17, 35, 49, 54 and 34 were drawn Wednesday night.

The California lottery quickly tweeted that a ticket will all matching numbers was sold at a Chevron gas station in Milpitas.

Winner, winner: A winning ticket has been issued in California for the $400million Powerball

Been here recently? This Chevron gas station in Milpitas sold a Powerball ticket with all six matching numbers

That tweet was followed by another saying two other tickets had five of the six numbers. One was sold in Modesto and the other in El Segundo.

There's no word yet on whether other tickets with all six matching numbers were sold in other states.

The lucky numbers were drawn at 10:59 pm (ET) Wednesday night.

New heights: The $400 miliion Powerball jackpot tops the list of lottery payouts in this convenience store in the Minneapolis skyway system,

While tonight's Powerball jackpot is the sixth-largest in U.S. lottery history, it may not be for long.

More than half of the 10 largest lottery jackpots have been reached since 2012.

That's because major game changes to Powerball and Mega Millions have created larger jackpots in shorter periods of time.

As for the winner, note that you shouldn't spend your new-found fortune on that beachfront mansion you've always dreamed of.

Financial experts agree that you should forego 
large vanity purchases and instead set up annuities and long-term trusts
 for descendants.

Getting bigger!  Each drawing without a winner rolls the jackpot over and makes it more lucrative
