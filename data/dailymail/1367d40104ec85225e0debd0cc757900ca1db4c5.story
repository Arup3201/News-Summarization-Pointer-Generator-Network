Prince William dressed up in ceremonial robes as he joined other members of the Royal Family for the annual Order of the Garter service today as the Duchess of Cambridge looked on.

Kate was one of the hundreds of spectators treated to the sight of Garter Knights walking through the grounds of Windsor Castle wearing their lavish blue velvet robes and black velvet hats with white plumes.

The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and the Duke of York were among the royal party at the ceremony in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

The Duchess of Cornwall had been due to attend but had to pull out after developing sinusitis.

A Clarence House spokesman said: 'The Duchess has been advised by doctors to rest having had a heavy cold which has turned into sinusitis. She very much hopes to attend Ascot tomorrow.'

The Duchess of Cambridge watched the proceedings wearing a sky blue coat by Christopher Kane and hat by Lock & Co. She previously wore designer coat in 2012 when at Buckingham Place for an event celebrating the London Olympics.

Kate was today joined by Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, who it seemed didn't want to be outdone by the ceremonial robes. She wore an elaborate feathered collar around her white dress and a flower embellished hat.

One of the 7,000 people invited to watch the procession inside the castle grounds was Kaz Aston, 40, from Windsor who runs charity website Monarchy Online.

She said the presence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made the event more exciting.

She said: 'This is the seventh time I have been, I come every year with a group of supporters of the charity. It get's better every time. It's got particularly exciting in the past few years with William and Kate.

'We missed her last year when she was pregnant but everyone was screaming loudly for Prince William. She looked lovely today, the pale blue is a lovely colour.'

Meanwhile, the pageboy who fainted during the Queen's speech a fortnight ago returned to public duties - and gave a faultless performance. Viscount Aithrie caused concern when he was heard to 
fall heavily while in the House of Lords earlier this month but was later 
reported to be fine.

Today he held the Queen's train during the pomp and ceremony of the annual event along with another schoolboy, Hugo Bertie.
