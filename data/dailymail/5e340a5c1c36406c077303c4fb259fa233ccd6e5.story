Health chiefs were today labelled ‘patronising’ for telling parents to confiscate their children’s sweet treats at Halloween.

NHS obesity experts insist trick-or-treating youngsters should have their sweets restricted and fruit handed out instead - and even advise that any treats collected should be given back in rations.

But the advice issued in Tayside, Scotland, ahead of Halloween events this Friday has resulted in a backlash from parents’ groups and politicians who branded it the ‘nanny state gone mad’.

Halloween night: NHS obesity experts insist trick-or-treating youngsters should have their sweets restricted

Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting website Netmums, said: ‘Halloween may be about scaring people but there’s no need to frighten parents with such silly advice.

‘Most mums and dads wouldn’t let their kids gorge on sweets, but for one fun night of the year, there is no harm done. Kids will burn off calories trick or treating.

‘So while health authorities mean well, talking down to parents and assuming they don’t have any common sense can be very counter-productive.’

The advice was issued by Dr Laura Stewart, team leader of the Paediatric Overweight Service Tayside in Dundee.

Dr Stewart also claims the trick-or-treaters should be given a balanced meal before hitting the streets, and parents should be role models by eating in moderation themselves.

Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone, who represents North East Scotland, said: ‘This really is utterly patronising to the point that it is insulting to parents.

‘People will look at this and come to the conclusion that it is the nanny state gone mad.

‘Halloween is an increasingly important event for children and gives them the opportunity to dress up and have fun, but the sheen will definitely come off the evening if NHS boards are breathing down families’ necks in this fashion.’

And Jack Hart, of the Freedom Association, which campaigns for personal freedom, added: ‘Halloween only comes once a year and it’s a real shame to see local bureaucrats trying to ruin the fun.

‘This over-cautious advice shows little respect for parents’ ability to do what they think is best for their children.’

NHS Tayside refused to respond directly to the criticisms.

But Dr Stewart said: ‘We want everyone to have a good time at Halloween but to think about using healthy snacks such as apples or satsumas for trick-or-treats instead of the usual sweets, which can easily turn into unwanted extra weight for children.’
