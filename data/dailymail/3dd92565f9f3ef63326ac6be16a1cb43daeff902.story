Troubled Arsenal star Mesut Ozil was quizzed by police over allegations the car he was driving was in a collision with a photographer.

The £42.5million record signing was back at home in Germany on Monday night after being given a two-day break to get away from problems on and off the pitch – he was rested from Saturday's team following the Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich.

Claim: Mesut Ozil was quizzed by police after he was involved in a collision with a photographer on Friday

In the stands: Ozil was omitted from Arsenal's matchday squad for their win over Sunderland on Saturday

In the driving seat: Ozil was said to have been involved in a collision with a photographer on Friday night

Ozil was not even named among the subs 
by boss Arsene Wenger for the 4-0 win over Sunderland, the day after the
 alleged incident which happened in Highgate, North London.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Police
 were called at approximately 7.18pm on Friday 21 February to reports of
 an alleged collision between a vehicle and a member of the public.

'The member of the public, a man in his 30s, sustained minor injuries. Officers have spoken to the driver of the vehicle.'

The spokesman said inquiries were continuing and no arrests have been made.

Ozil has been criticised for his recent dip in form, which was highlighted as he missed a penalty in the Gunners' 2-0 Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich.

But Bayern star Thomas Muller believes his Germany team-mate is simply suffering from not having a winter break, something he enjoyed during his spells at Real Madrid and Werder Bremen.

Impact: Ozil has scored five goals for Arsenal since arriving from Real Madrid for just over £42million

Muller said: 'It’s not easy for Mesut but I know how good he can be and I hope he has many good games for Arsenal.'

Ozil has scored four goals for Arsenal in the Premier League and made eight assists in 21 days, but hasn't scored since early December and has been on disappointing form.

The 25-year-old has gone back to Germany in an attempt to breathe fresh life into his Arsenal career, given the time off by Wenger. He has jetted back to his homeland for a few days of rest and relaxation.

Ozil and Wenger, who hopes to have injured Aaron Ramsey back for the clash against Tottenham on March 16, remain determined to make a success of the playmaker's move to London and hope the short trip back to Germany can help rejuvenate the 25-year-old.

The man: Most fans are sticking by Ozil and calling his form a blip, but others want a drastic improvement
