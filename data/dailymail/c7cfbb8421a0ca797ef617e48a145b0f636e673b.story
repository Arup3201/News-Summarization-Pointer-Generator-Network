Didier Drogba has completed his dream return to Chelsea.

The Ivorian has signed a one-year deal at Stamford Bridge,
having become a legend at the club after being signed by Jose Mourinho for
£24million in 2004.

And Drogba revealed he couldn't turn down the opportunity to
work with the Portuguese boss again.

He said: 'It was an easy decision - I couldn't turn down the
opportunity to work with Jose again.  Everyone knows the special
relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me.

New boy: Drogba returns to Chelsea after two years away from west London 

'My desire to win is still the same and I look forward to
the opportunity to help this team. I am excited for this next chapter of my
career.'

Mourinho allayed fears Drogba would sully his impeccable
legacy at Chelsea, insisting that the Ivorian is still one of the best strikers
in world football.

'He’s coming because he’s one of the best strikers in
Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he’s not
protected by history or what he’s done for this club previously,' Mourinho
said.

  'Looks like Drogba is back, loved our battles best big game player I can remember.'

'He is coming with the mentality to make more history.'

Drogba's arrival gives Mourinho's side moe firepower up
front. Despite marquee signing Diego Costa's arrival, Fernando Torres and
Romelu Lukaku have both been linked with moves away from the club.

Drogba's last kick for Chelsea in his initial eight-year
spell was the winning penalty to hand the west Londoners the Champions League
trophy.

The striker had already equalised in extra-time against
Bayern Munich at their Allianz Arena.

Mourinho has brought Drogba back into the fold at a time
when two stalwarts have left the club in Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole.

2004/05:  Premier League and League Cup

2005/06:  Premier League

2006/07:  FA Cup and League Cup

2008/09:  FA Cup

2009/10:  Premier League and FA Cup

2011/12:  FA Cup and Champions League

Lampard has completed a move to new MLS side New York City
while Cole has moved to Roma.

Fellow Blues legend Petr Cech has also been linked with a
move away with Thibaut Courtois returning from loan at Atletico Madrid.

It means only John Terry remains from the spine of
Mourinho's original Chelsea side, which picked up back-to-back Premier League
titles in 2005 and 2006.

Appearances: 341

Goals: 151

Goals per game: 0.44

Major trophies: 10

Drogba signed for Galatasaray in January 2013 after a short
spell at Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua after bowing out at the Blues.

He had an emotional return to Stamford Bridge with the
Turkish side in last season's Champions League last-16 before leaving the club
this summer.

Now Drogba has sealed a move back to the club where he
became one of the most feared strikers in world football.

Veteran: Drogba has over 100 caps for the Ivory Coast and made over 200 league appearances for Chelsea

With Didier Drogba, the man whose penalty secured a first Champions League win for Chelsea in the clubs history returning to Stamford Bridge, we look at other frontmen who have returned to their former clubs. Those who have had a second coming have often enjoyed a hero’s welcome upon their return, but, on the pitch, were they hits or misses? Ian Rush (Liverpool 1980-87 & 1988-96)Having joined Liverpool from Chester as a youngster for £300,000 in May 1980, a British transfer record for a teenager at the time, it quickly became obvious that Rush was a prolific goal scorer. After six seasons and 168 goals, Rush made a surprise move to Juventus for £3.2 million. Just seven goals came in twenty nine appearances in Italy and, after his unrest became clear, Rush returned as a hero to Anfield. In his first campaign back at Liverpool, still officially on loan from Juventus, he blasted 30 league goals and went on to hit the net another 142 times in all competitions for the Reds.  Verdict: Hit Robbie Keane (Tottenham 2002-08 & 2009-11)The Irish striker always had the potential to play at the top level. Having impressed at Coventry and Leeds via the briefest of stints at Inter Milan, Keane made his mark as a natural goal scorer at White Hart Lane. 80 league goals came in his first six years in North London. Keane ultimately could never rekindle that success after an unsuccessful move to Liverpool in 2008 and returned to Spurs the following February. Despite 15 goals in all competitions upon his return, Keane was never quite the same player.Verdict: Miss Mark Hughes (Manchester United 1980-86 & 1988-95)Hughes was on the score sheet 37 times in the league for Manchester United, having risen through the club’s academy ranks. His form could not be replicated once he left for Barcelona and he suffered similar problems at Bayern Munich, to whom he was then loaned. Hughes returned to Old Trafford and won the PFA Player of the Year Award in his first season back in England (1988/89). Under the stewardship of Sir Alex Ferguson, he went on to score over 100 more goals for the club and cemented himself in its rich history.Verdict: Hit  Teddy Sheringham (Tottenham 1992-97 & 2001-03)Although Sheringham’s great trophy-winning days came at Manchester United between 1997 and 2001, he will always be remembered as a club legend by Spurs fans and players. He scored 99 goals in his first six years wearing the white of Tottenham and, after an extremely successful spell at Old Trafford, he returned to White Hart Lane to lift Tottenham fans from their seats another 26 times. He has since been inducted into their Hall of Fame.Verdict: Hit

Peter Crouch (Tottenham 1998-2000 & 2009-11)Another player to return to Tottenham was the familiar figure of Peter Crouch. He never played senior football for Spurs as a youth player, but returned over ten years later, for a fee reported to be around £9 million. Crouch had a mixed career at Spurs second time around, scoring 24 goals but also suffering two separate, three month long barren spells in front of goal. His hero status gained by scoring the winner against Manchester City in 2010, securing Spurs Champions League football was tarnished when he scored an own goal against the same opposition the following year. Spurs missed out on joining Europe’s elite on that occasion, with City qualifying.Verdict: Miss Thierry Henry (Arsenal 1999-2007 & 2012)The briefest of returns to Arsenal for the Frenchman. The fans wouldn’t have been bothered had he not scored at all after his 226 goals before he moved to Barcelona in 2007. Instead, the prolific striker bagged the winner on his second ‘debut.’ Arsenal later unveiled a statue for Henry, who emotionally accepted the gesture outside the Emirates Stadium, with the club colours draped around his neck.Verdict: Hit
