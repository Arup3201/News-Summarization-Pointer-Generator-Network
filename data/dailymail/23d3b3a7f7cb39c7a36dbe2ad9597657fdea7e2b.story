The man who survived being flung through a sunroof during a horrific car accident last week was a salesman trying to impress an old school friend on a date.

After a night at a bingo hall, Kylee Weston, 30, was driving Dan Page, 31, home when she lost control of her Peugeot 406, which rolled and flung Mr Page six feet from the car.

The old school friends had recently met back up after 10 years and went out for an evening in Coseley, Wolverhampton, in the West Midlands on Sunday.

'We're just friends': Kylee Weston and Dan Page were driving home after not seeing each other for 10 years when Ms Weston lost control of the car, sending Mr Page flying through the sunroof

A 'freak of physics': Mr Page, who was flung from the sunroof of the car just moments before, survived unscathed

On the way home at about 10.30pm, their date was cut short when Ms Weston took a corner too sharply and rolled her car through a garden wall.

Incredibly, despite being flung six feet from the 
vehicle and landing face-down on the front lawn of a West Midlands home,
Mr Page got up, dusted himself off and checked on Ms Weston.

Mr Page, a double-glazing salesman, relived his terrifying ordeal for the first time yesterday.

Close call: Ms Weston cried when she saw the CCTV footage and couldn't believe she nearly killed Mr Page, a friend she hadn't seen for many years

He said: 'It’s all a surreal blur. The sunroof wasn’t even open at the time, it must have smashed on the first roll.

'As a double-glazing salesman I wouldn’t usually condone a flimsy bit of glass - but I’m glad this shattered upon impact.

'If it hadn’t of then I would have been slammed into the roof and I’d be dead.

'It was just a freak of physics that I came out of the top and survived.

Acrobatics: Mr Page completes an unintentional flip in mid-air as he flies straight out of the car

'My luck had not been in for most of the night at the bingo hall - but it certainly did come the end of the night. I can’t believe I’m still walking.

Mr Page said he was not in a relationship with Ms Weston.

He said: 'We’d met back up after about 10 years - there’s nothing going on between us but you never know, my gymnastics might have impressed her.

'I don’t know if chucking me out the car was her way of saying "I’m not interested".

'But never say never. I don’t want to say much more than that really.'

Lucky escape: While Mr Page walked away unharmed, Ms Weston's Peugeot 406 was not so lucky

Ms Weston, a divorced mother-of-two and officer worker, cried when she saw the CCTV footage.

She said: 'When I saw the footage back I just burst into tears I was inches away of rolling the car on top of Dan.

'I remember in the seconds after it happened I look around and I couldn’t see Dan anywhere.

'I expected to find him half way down the road and then he just popped up next to the car.

'I think I just said "bloody hell bab - are you alright?" and he just stood next to the car in shock looking at me.

'I got out of the car and we just hugged until police arrived.

'I couldn’t believe we’d met up again after all these years and I nearly went and killed him.

Quite a tumble: After impact, Mr Page was quick to dust himself off and check on Ms Weston

CCTV footage of the accident and lucky escape has been viewed online hundreds of thousands of times after home-security cameras outside Howard Hamilton's home captured the crash.

Mr Hamilton, 75, a former brewery driver, said: 'I was just dropping off to sleep at about 10.30pm when I heard this almighty bang.

'Me and my wife Margaret looked out of the bedroom window to see this car lying in our front garden.

'This couple in their 30s were standing in front of the car hugging - I looked at them, then back at this mangled car and I thought "how on earth are they alive?"

'When I checked the footage back it just compounded my amazement - their car just somersaulted and the man comes flying out the sunroof.

The house and its garden wall which was left destroyed after the crash

'I’ve caught people stealing my door mat on CCTV before but never anything like this.

'It was like something out of a police action film. Somebody could have easily been killed if they had walking by.

'If this happens again in the daytime it would be teeming with kids - and you could be looking at schoolchildren being killed. Something has to be done to stop these accidents happening.'

Shockingly, it is the fourth time 
since 2010 that the family have had their garden wall smashed down by 
out-of-control vehicles.

Mr Hamilton's sister Joyce, 61, who lives next door, added: 'I’m coming to think we’re getting used to it.

'The bang woke me up and you think "oh no the garden wall’s gone again".

'Fortunately there was nobody walking up the footpath. If somebody had been walking up the footpath, you don’t know what would have happened to them.'

Neighbour, Howard Hampton, caught the crash on camera. It is the fourth crash on his front lawn since 2010

A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'We were called to reports of a silver Peugeot 406 in collision with a wall.

'A woman was arrested on suspicion of drink driving but was later released without charge.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance, said: 'We were called to reports that a car had overturned at 10.32pm on Sunday evening. An ambulance, a rapid response team and a paramedic were in attendance.

'One patient was taken to hospital, the other was not. Both of them received minor injuries.'
