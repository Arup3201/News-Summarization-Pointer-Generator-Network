A new map reveals how many days couples spend a month having sex in order to conceive a baby.

On average, American couples have sex 6.1 days a month in hopes of adding a new member to the family.

Created by Ovuline, the map incorporates Ovia data from users in the US.

Ovia, an app produced by the company, lets users track women's reproductive cycles and health.

The creators found that in Iowa, people have sex 7 days per month on average as they try to make a baby - the most in the US.

Vermont, Nebraska, Wyoming and Iowa followed close behind, with 6.94, 6.92, 6.9 and 6.83 day averages, respectively.

Couples in Washington, D.C., however, only had sex an average of 4.62 days - the lowest amount in the country.

'Our insights confirm what many people always suspected: DC is the least sexy place in America,' Ovuline said on its website. 'Just kidding DC.' 

Other low-ranking areas were Mississippi, New York, Kentucky and Delaware, which had sex on average 5.27, 5.53, 5.62, and 5.7 times a month in order to conceive, respectively. 

The findings are reportedly drawn from '4.35 million instances of sex and tens of millions of data points from hundreds of thousands Ovia users.'
