A schoolboy says he was punched by a teacher after he joked about his favorite football team.

12-year-old Reginald Wells says he was hit at the Willie Ray Smith Middle School in Beaumont, Texas, in an exclusive interview with 12News Sunday.

'The last person's voice I heard was some girl saying that I should call my mom, and then he like hit me, and I blacked out,' the 7th grade pupil said.

Punched: Reginald Wells claims he was punched by the teacher after joking about his football team

Reginald says he stopped in the hallway to speak to a teacher. He said he made fun of the teacher's favourite team and that was when he was hit.

'All of a sudden he just hit me, in my shoulder... And I looked at him like "what the heck?"'

Reginald, who is 4ft 11 tall and weighs 80 pounds, pushed the teacher's shoulder and then he claims the adult punched him in the face and knocked him out. Reginald said he woke up a few seconds later.

He said: 'The left side of my face was numb, my lip hurt, my head was hurt, like it had been shaken.'

Reginald's mother Adrianne says the principal told her what happened, based on what another teacher says he saw.

'(The principal) said Reginald was punched, in the shoulder, and then hit two times and uppercut, and then slid across the floor,' Adrianne said. 'It weighed heavy on my heart, because I've never put my hands on my son.'

Adrianne says the teacher was fired and escorted off the premises immediately. Â 

Reginald said the teacher spoke to him afterwards saying: 'I can't apologize for what I did, I was just having a bad day and I just snapped.'

Adrianne says she cannot believe the teacher was not arrested. 'For you to just let a teacher do that to him and just walk off, I can't accept that.' she said.

Adrianne filed a report with Beaumont Independent School District Police Department and wants to press charges, but says no one with the school district has contacted her since Friday. She says she is now seeking legal representation.

She said: 'I'm just not understanding. I know there's a lot going on with BISD, but first priority is to protect the kids.'

12 News have approached the school district for a comment but they have not yet responded.
