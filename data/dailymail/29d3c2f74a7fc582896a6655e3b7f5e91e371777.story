Luis Enrique was delighted with Luis Suarez's performance for Barcelona against Espanyol on Wednesday as the Spanish giants won the Catalan Super Cup on penalties. 

The Uruguayan created Gerard Pique's goal in the 1-1 draw with a delightful chip and in so doing claimed his second assist in as many games after laying on Neymar's opener against Real Madrid on Saturday. 

Barca's manager Luis Enrique was impressed with what he saw, and singled out the former Liverpool striker for praise.

Barca boss Luis Enrique said Suarez  'made a difference to the game every minute he played'

'Suarez played very well. He got most of his actions right,' Luis Enrique was quoted as saying on Goal.com.

'He made a difference to the game every minute he played. He shows mobility and eagerness, like the rest of the squad.'

The Barcelona coach also stressed that he was pleased with his team's overall performance and believes they have quickly put the disappointment of losing to Real Madrid behind them.
