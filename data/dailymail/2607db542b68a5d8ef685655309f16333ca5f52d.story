A man who stabbed a builder was caught on camera boasting of how he had attacked him.

Adam White, 22, of Liverpool, was captured on CCTV laughing as he mimicked stabbing and beating while a friend watches.

The killer stabbed widower Jeffery Burrows at the latter's flat in Brighton in April last year.

Adam White has been sentenced for ten years following the brutal attack on a builder in Brighton

Lewes Crown Court heard that the pair had rowed about a stolen motorcycle.

White then drew a knife and stabbed him so hard in the midriff it damaged his spine, The Sun reported.

CCTV images after the attack show a relaxed-looking White in a bar.

In the minute-long video, he can be seen clearly using his arms to mimic stabbing and hitting an imaginary figure.

At one point he stops to nudge another man who is watching him, and pats his head.

Sussex Police uploaded the video of the killer on to their YouTube channel.

White was sentenced to ten years imprisonment at Lewes Crown Court on Thursday.

He had been found not guilty of murder.

But he was guilty of manslaughter on 29 November after a 14-day trial.

Joel Elliott, 22, of Brighton, was found not guilty of murder and was discharged.

Emergency services had been called to the flat at 7.40pm on Sunday, April 29.

Jeff Burrows received treatment from paramedics at the scene but was pronounced dead there shortly after 9pm.

A post mortem examination was held on Monday 30 April, and confirmed that the cause of death was due to stab wounds.

A disagreement between the two about a stolen motorbike ended in Mr Burrows being stabbed in his Brighton flat

A jury found White not guilty of murder and instead returned a verdict of manslaughter
