An man has been reunited with his beloved 15-year-old dog two months after the pet wandered off on a camping trip and was feared eaten by coyotes.

In a touching display of affection, Romeo the Nova Scotia Toller pounced into Mike Stotts' arms and licked his face after a couple from California tracked down Stotts to his home in Austin, Texas.

Eli Madrid came across the dog near Hyde Memorial State Park near Santa Fe, New Mexico on Sunday and found Stotts' contact after calling the microchip company listed on Romeo's collar.

'It was surreal,' Stott, 60, told ABC News of the reunion. 'All 
of a sudden it was back to normal, like he was never gone.'

Until Romeo became lost on a camping trip two months ago, the man and dog, who was adopted from a shelter as a puppy, had been inseparable.

Romeo would join Stotts everyday as he went to work as his business, an apartment-locating service, and the dog followed him on every hiking trip he went on - particularly enjoying swimming holes.

But in August, they ventured to  Hyde Memorial State Park together and Stotts returned alone.

'The first night there it started raining a little bit, so I unzipped the tent to put up the rain flap, and apparently he snuck out and I didn’t notice,' Stotts said.

'As soon as I noticed I went out looking with a lantern because there’s a big coyote problem in the park and I knew time was of the essence.'

For the next three days, he searched for Romeo - posting fliers and enlisting the help of park rangers and fellow campers - but with no luck.

'By that last day I'd given up,' Stotts said. 'Everyone said there was no way he could survive.

'I put a little cross memorial up on the mountain the last time I went up looking for him. I wanted to picture him that way instead of being eaten by coyotes.'

He returned home to Austin but missed his companion of 15 years. Even visiting a rescue shelter in the hopes of adopting a new dog did not help, and he left empty handed.

Relief: Stotts had microchipped Romeo years ago so he could be located when the dog was found

But on Monday, he received a call from a company that manufactures microchips implanted under animals' skin in case they are lost. Romeo had a chip implanted years ago, Stotts said.

They had been called by Eli Madrid, who had found the dog five miles from the nearest camping ground.

'My first thought was that I better not get too excited because I thought they'd found his remains,' Stotts said.

But he jumped in his car with his girlfriend and drove 12 hours to Santa Fe. They were finally reunited with Romeo on Tuesday afternoon.

'It was indescribable because it was like
seeing a loved one resurrected,' Stotts said

Romeo, who is partially deaf, had lost a great deal of weight and had a tear on his ear, but is expected to make a full recovery, ABC reported.

'It’s a testament to the will to survive,' Stotts said. 'Here he is a little coddled house dog, but his instincts kicked in when necessary.'

Stotts thanked Madrid and his wife Jamie for caring for his pet and making the effort to contact him.

He added that micro-chipping Romeo, which cost around $50, was 'the best thing I've ever done'.
