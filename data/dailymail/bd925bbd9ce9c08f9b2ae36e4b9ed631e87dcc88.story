Two male strippers who were less than three feet from Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson when she flew from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas this week have shared video from inside the plane.

Axl Goode and Taylor Cole, who model for romance novel covers and work as male dancers, were returning from a convention outside Cleveland on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 on Monday night and filmed themselves on board the plane.

They've now both put themselves in a voluntary 21-day quarantine and said they washed their clothes and bleached all of their luggage after learning they came so close to Ms Vinson.

Inside Edition first reported on the video that Mr Cole took aboard the evening flight, where Ms Vinson was sitting just a few feet away.

'If she was contagious on that flight, I was there with her in that space for three hours. I would rather keep my friends, family and other people safe by sacrificing the next three weeks and staying indoors in my apartment,' Mr Goode, 26, told MailOnline. 

Ms Vinson had a low-grade fever when she boarded the plane and was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas just hours later with Ebola. 

She was flown to a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Wednesday and is in stable condition as she battles the deadly disease.

The CDC has said they fear Ms Vinson may have been contagious on the Cleveland-to-Dallas flight - and should could even have been contagious last Friday, when she flew from Dallas to Cleveland aboard Flight 1142. 

The video Mr Cole and Mr Goode took inside the cabin of  Flight 1143 doesn't show Ms Vinson. Mr Goode said he believes that she was sitting either in front of or behind him. 

The two friends were returning from making appearances at RomantiCon, a convention of romance novel writers and fans in Canton, Ohio, 

A Dallas County epidemiologist who talked to Mr Goode today told him that he and Mr Cole were less than three feet from Ms Vinson when they flew home to Texas.

Dallas public health officials say the CDC never told Ms Vinson or any of the other healthcare workers who treated Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan not to fly. Ms Vinson also got CDC permission before getting on her return flight on Monday.

Now, Frontier Airlines are warning passengers aboard five more flights that they were on the same plane that carried Ms Vinson. 

Mr Goode said he plans to stay locked up in his apartment through November 3 - 21 days after his exposure to Ms Vinson.

Mr Goode said he plans to stay locked in his Dallas apartment until after November 3 and will not be able to work during that time

Mr Goode's fans have raised nearly $2,500 to help them pay for their three weeks in isolation

He has been told to take his temperature twice a day - once when he wakes up and once six hours later.

In the meantime, he said, he is trying not to dwell on the worst-case scenario.  

'It’s certainly horribly frightening. If you read about what happens to somebody with Ebola and how  their body breaks down, it’s a nightmare. It's a terrifying nightmare come to life,' he told MailOnline.

He plans to pass the time by writing. After appearing on romance novel covers for years, Mr Goode recently finish writing a novel of his own -  Primal Desire. 

However, those three weeks in quarantine also mean that Mr Goode and Mr Cole are losing money. Their supporters have set up a GoFundMe campaign that has already raised $2,500 to support them through the time.
