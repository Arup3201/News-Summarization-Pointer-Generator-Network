Holiday cheer: Despite it being early September, Tesco is preparing for Christmas

It may be 110 days left until Christmas, but according to Tesco it’s already here.

Branches of the supermarket chain have already set up dedicated Christmas aisles across the nation.

The first reports of Christmas chocolate boxes on sale in Tesco branches came on the 29th August with pictures appeared on Twitter.

Since then the Twitter-sphere has been filled with angry posts about the premature holiday season advertisements.

The Christmas aisles have now gone nationwide with reports of Tesco stores in Stafford, Scunthorpe, Hull and Newcastle already displaying chocolate boxes with tinsel and snowmen.

Upset Tweeters posted pictures of decorated shop aisles pointing out that not only are we nearly two months away from Halloween, we still have Bonfire Night to look forward to before Christmas is upon us.

The news of Tesco’s holiday marketing follows rival ASDA’s introduction of Santa’s Grotto’s last week.

Although ASDA, unlike Tesco, say their introduction of Christmas cheer in August was only a temporary gimmick to offer financial help for parents worried about affording the holiday season.

But parents complained that the appearance of Santa Clause had the completely opposite effect and made them more stressed about how to afford Christmas.

Mother-of-three Sharon Spencer from Gravesend, Kent said: 'My children have already starting telling me what they want for Christmas, but are expecting it to come sooner rather than later.

'It puts a lot of pressure on us parents especially given the fact that money is tight at the best of times.'

The Advertising Standards Authority has also received complaints from people saying it is 'socially irresponsible' to promote Christmas so far in advance.

A spokesman said: 'The ASA has been receiving a steady flurry of complaints from irritated and disenchanted consumers objecting to the premature appearance of Christmas advertisements.

'Those who have contacted us have been disappointed that, although the ASA accepts that some people will find it frustrating to see advertisements for Christmas appearing in the autumn, this is not an area that we regulate.

Still September: Tweeters accused Tesco of mixing up their months

He added: 'Advertisers are able to choose when they wish to begin their seasonal advertisements and if potential customers are irritated by their decision, it is a risk that the advertiser must accept.

'However, the ASA has received more complaints on this issue this year than ever before, suggesting increasing consumer frustration.'

He said that many complaints have involved worried shoppers saying Christmas advertisement intensify the financial pressures prolonging the amount of time that people find themselves economically burdened.

A Tesco spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We often have some limited early seasonal products in store, as that allows our customers to stock up when they chose, and manage their spending over time.

‘Our customers appreciate having that choice.'
