Police have found the bodies of four women and a baby after storming a 12-acre compound controlled by thousands of devotees of Indian 'godman' Rampal Maharaj.

The religious guru is wanted by police on charges that include murder and is believed to be holed up inside the sprawling compound in northern India where his followers are hiding him while they try to fight off police.

When police arrived, thousands of followers fled the ashram claiming they had been held at the compound against their will.

But hundreds of others used stones, petrol bombs and other weapons to try and beat back the invading police.

Director general of police SN Vashisht said the bodies of four women were found at the sprawling compound but it was unclear how they died, while an 18-month-old child appeared to have died of natural causes.

Another woman apparently suffering from a heart condition also died after being taken to hospital, Vashisht said.

'All dead bodies have been sent to the hospital where they will undergo a postmortem to ascertain the exact cause of their deaths.'

Police stepped up their search today for the 63-year-old guru whom they believe is still holed up inside the compound spread over 12-acres.

They were also checking those leaving the ashram in case Rampal, who considers himself an incarnation of the 15th-century mystic poet Kabir, was hiding in the crowd.

Police yesterday stormed the ashram, which has been guarded by hundreds of followers for days after a court ordered their leader arrested on murder and other charges.

Police fired water canon and tear gas and baton-charged the supporters who were armed with stones, petrol bombs and other weapons, television footage showed.

Followers leaving the compound have been dropped off at nearby bus and train stations, Jashandeep Singh, the assistant police superintendent, said.

'What started as a trickle hasn't yet stopped and we have dropped off around 10,000 people at nearby bus and train stations.

He added: 'The people who left the ashram mostly said that they were being held against their will, as a shield for the guru against any police action.'

Police are seeking Rampal's arrest after he repeatedly refused court orders to appear to answer charges including conspiracy to murder, inciting mobs and contempt of court.

India has been rocked by several scandals involving immensely popular 'godmen', mostly Hindu ascetics who claim to possess mystical powers. Last year one was charged with sexually assaulting a schoolgirl.

For many Indians, gurus play an integral role in daily life. They say they offer a pathway to enlightenment in return for spiritual devotion and often give donations to ashrams, temples and charity projects.
