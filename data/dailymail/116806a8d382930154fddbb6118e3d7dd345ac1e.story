An Albanian immigrant who has been forced to leave Britain after 12 years has spoken of his desperation to be reunited with his family.

Edmond Danushi moved to the UK when he was just 18, but has been unable to meet his newborn daughter since moving back to his native country a year ago.

His wife Theresa says she is struggling to cope without him, and has launched an appeal to the authorities to allow him to return to Britain.

Family: Mrs Danushi and her children (left to right) Aalissia, Keiren, Eli and Aaliyah can only communicate with Mr Danushi via Skype

Mr Danushi, 30, has been continuously renewing his visa for the past 12 years, and recently applied for 'indefinite leave to remain' so he could stay in his adopted home permanently.

He says the Home Office advised him to return to Albania in August last year to get his papers in order - but new legislation means he is unable to re-enter the UK.

He lost his job last Easter, meaning that for him to settle permanently his wife must have savings of at least Â£18,600, which she does not.

The Danushis met in Worthing, Sussex in 2001, when they were both teenagers, and now live in South-East London with their children Eli, 10, Keiren, eight, Aaliyah, two, and 10-month-old Aalissa.

Together: The couple have been married for a decade after meeting when they were teenagers

Fury: Mr Danushi, pictured talking on Skype, is not allow to stay in the UK because he and his wife do not have enough money saved up

'It is a disgrace they have taken me from my wife and family,' Mr Danushi said via Skype from Albania. 'I am most hurt for my children who are forced to grow up without a father.

'No one can understand the pain I feel. The worst part is not having been there when my daughter was born, and not being able to hold her.'

Mrs Danshi, 28, said: 'We have been together for 12 years and married for 10. We speak on Skype every day but his son won't talk to him because he gets too upset.

'My 10-year-old daughter Eli keeps saying, "I want my dad." He never claimed from the state, he always did a range of jobs.'

She has been prescribed anti-depressants to cope with the stress of her situation, and says she has developed a skin condition.

Distraught: The family say they are finding it difficult to cope without their father

'There is so much I have had to cope with on my own,' she added. 'We have four kids and the youngest has never met her dad.

'The older ones have been referred for counselling because they've found it so hard to cope.

'Some people come to this country and abuse the system but he was never like that.'

Heidi Alexander, the MP for Lewisham East, is helping the family with its troubles, and a tribunal to settle Mr Danushi's fate is set to be held in February next year.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution.

'But family life must not be established here at the taxpayer's expense.

'Mr Danushi's application was refused because it did not meet the requirements of the immigration rules.'
