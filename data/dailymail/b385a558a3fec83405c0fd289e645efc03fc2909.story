Jennifer K. 'Kaya' Thompson, 44, has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against Bill Cosby

A Bill Cosby accuser, 'Jane Doe No.2', has decided to reveal her identity after finding the strength to finally go public about the alleged attack 30 years ago.

Jennifer K. 'Kaya' Thompson has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the The Cosby Show star.

Ms Thompson, a 44-year-old from Florida, told People: 'It's come to my understanding that there's greater credibility for my testimony with a full name and an image.  

'I am so very grateful for the Jane Doe who came before me in the lawsuit 10 years ago... My mother and I were very eager to give our support via testimony at that time – however, not to the general public. I was not quite strong enough then.' 

In 1988, the then 17-year-old aspiring model met Cosby via her modelling agency in New York. 

He assured the teen and her parents that he would help her become a star. 

Ms Thompson told People that Cosby made uncomfortable advances against her which ended in her feeling pressured to perform a sexual act on him.

'I'm like a robot, and that is what I became, and that is what I did for him,' she said. She was reportedly given $700 as she left his home. 

She told People that she had decided to come forward now because she 'would rather go to bed at night knowing that I've been honest'.

She also felt that remaining as 'Jane Doe No.2' made her allegations less credible.

Ultimately, Ms Thompson hoped that Cosby will come clean about the mounting allegations against him.  

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, on Thursday. 

When Ms Thompson's story was originally revealed in November 2014, Singer called it 'absurd' to publish an 'unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person'.

'Jane Doe No.2' has revealed her identity and claimed that Bill Cosby (pictured in January) sexually assaulted her when she was a teenage model in New York 

Thompson was one of the 13 Jane Does in a 2005 civil suit against Cosby from Andrea Constand. Miss Constand eventually settled out of court. 

Last Friday, Cosby's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - Tamara Green, Therese Serignese and Linda Traitz - accusing the beleaguered comedian of decades-old sexual offenses.

The accusers, all of whom have stepped forward in recent years, said Cosby's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence.

But Cosby's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self-defense as his character was under attack. 

'The law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked,' the lawyers argued in their 38-page filing. 

'Instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims.'

Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for the three accusers, said his clients disagree with that position.

'We believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual, it must be truthful,' he said. 

'We look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful.'

Cosby's legal team has said their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct.

The former star of The Cosby Show hasn't been charged with any crime. More than a dozen women have stepped forward in recent years to level various assault accusations.

Tamara Green, a 56-year-old California lawyer, says Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her Los Angeles-area apartment in the early 1970s.

Therese Serignese says Cosby drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in Las Vegas around 1976. 

And Linda Traitz alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a Southern California beach in about 1970.

Green was joined in the lawsuit by Linda Traitz (left), who alleged that Cosby tried to drug her and then sexually groped her in 1970, and nurse Therese Serignese (right), 57, who said the comic raped her in 1976 when she was 19 years old 

Cosby's lawyers said his representatives were responding to the accusations in strongly-worded rebukes.

One November 2014 statement references Traitz's 'extensive' criminal record, which includes larceny, fraud and drug possession charges.

'As the old saying goes, "consider the source,"' wrote Cosby attorney Martin Singer, who also attached copies of Traitz's Florida criminal and prison records with the statement.

Another November 2014 statement cited by Cosby's accusers offers 'general comments' on the allegations and does not specifically name any of the accusers, his lawyers say.

'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity,' Singer wrote at the time. 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.'

The three women seek an unspecified amount of money for compensatory and punitive damages.

Many of the accusations against him exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution. But the scandal has taken its toll on the 77-year-old actor and comedian as he has sought to revive his career with a national stand-up comedy tour.

Cosby has canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances as more accusers have come forward, and women's groups have protested or threatened to rally at many of his public appearances.

Lawyers for the three accusers have until March 20 to file a reply to Cosby's motion to dismiss the suit.

Green originally filed the defamation lawsuit in December 2014 and Serignese and Traitz joined later. The suit is filed in US District Court in Springfield, in western Massachusetts. Cosby has a home nearby in Shelburne Falls.
