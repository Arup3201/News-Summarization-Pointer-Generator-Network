A prosecutor told jurors Friday that it was no mistake that a Rutgers student used a webcam to spy on his roommate's intimate encounter with another man.

'The defendant's acts were deliberately planned to invade Tyler's privacy,' First Assistant Middlesex County Prosecutor Julia McClure told jurors to open the hate crime trial of Dharun Ravi, 'and to deprive him of his dignity.'

'They were planned to expose Tyler Clementi's sexual orientation and they were planned to expose Tyler Clementi's private sexual activity,' she said.

Hate crime: Ravi is facing 15 charges, including invasion of privacy, after he posted webcam video of his roommate Tyler Clementi (pictured) kissing a man

Nineteen-year-old Ravi faces 15 criminal charges, including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation, a hate crime punishable by up to ten years in state prison.

The case spurred a national conversation about how young gays are treated when news of it broke in September 2010 after Ravi's roommate, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide.

In her half-hour opening statement, McClure did not mention Clementi's suicide.

Ravi's lawyer was expected to give his opening statement later Friday morning, likely saying that Ravi meant no harm.

That's a position McClure tried to dispel preventatively. 'The defendant's acts were not a prank, they were not an accident and they were not a mistake,' she said. 'They were mean-spirited, they were malicious and they were criminal.'

She also said that Ravi began telling friends that he was unhappy he'd have a gay roommate soon after he received his Rutgers housing assignment in August 2010.

The case was so well known that it took four days to seat a jury of 16 â€” including four alternates.

The first witness called by prosecutors was Austin Chung, a high school friend of Ravi's who testified that Ravi told him about seeing Clementi 'making out with some dude' via webcam.

On cross-examination, Chung, a student at Stevens Institute of Technology, said he didn't know Ravi to have a problem with gay people.

Three other witnesses, all Rutgers students, followed Chung on the stand.

Altman asked each if they knew Ravi to speak against gays. All said he didn't.

But one, Cassandra Cicco, said Ravi told her that he streamed the video to see whether Clementi was gay - as he suspected.

'He said he didn't have any problem with homosexuals and in fact he had a really good friend who was homosexual,' Cicco said.

She said she and a group of a 
half-dozen students were shown a one-second snippet of streaming video. 
She wanted to see it, she said, out of curiosity.

She said that there were two men in the view and at least one had his shirt off.

'Someone pressed "end" on the feed and it ended abruptly and we're like, that happened,' she said.

Another student who lived in the dorm said Ravi told him he'd seen Clementi with another man on his webcam.

'It was pretty crazy and scandalous,' 
Alvin Artha said. 'He described the guy he invited over as older. And 
that was more the scandalous part than that he had invited another 
male.'

To convict Ravi of bias intimidation, prosecutors would need to show he acted because he was anti-gay.

Just
before opening statements, one more juror was excused after telling the
judge that he needed to change an answer he'd given in a questionnaire.
The judge didn't offer any further explanation.

The trial is going forward because Ravi, 19, rejected a plea bargain offer that would have let him avoid any jail time and receive the state's help if federal authorities tried to deport him to India, where he was born.

Roommates: Ravi and Clementi were roommates at Rutgers University in New Jersey

Lawyer Steven Altman said the reason for not accepting the deal was simple: He's not guilty of any crimes.

If
the other man in the video is brought to the witness stand, his 
testimony could become a key part of the trial. He's been identified 
publicly only by the initials M.B.

The trial is expected to last three to four weeks.

'Roommate asked for the room till 
midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him 
making out with a dude. Yay.'

The
main alleged crime happened just weeks after Clementi, a violinist from
Ridgewood, and Ravi, an Ultimate Frisbee player from Plainsboro, moved 
into their dorm room at Rutgers.

Clementi's
parents said he told them he was gay in the days before he left for 
Rutgers. But court filings show that Ravi already knew that from 
Clementi's web postings.

Authorities
say Ravi used the webcam on his computer to check on Clementi when he'd
asked to have the room to himself so he could have company.

Ravi
posted a Twitter message about it: 'Roommate asked for the room till 
midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him 
making out with a dude. Yay.'

Initially, another first-year Rutgers student, Molly Wei, of Princeton Junction, was also charged in the case.

But she entered a pre-trial intervention program last year that allows her to avoid jail time and emerge without a criminal record if she meets a list of conditions for three years.

She also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in their case against Ravi.

Two nights after the first alleged spying incident, authorities say Ravi tried to do the same thing when Clementi asked him to stay away from the room again.

A day after that, Clementi jumped from the George Washington Bridge, leaving behind a terse Facebook status updated: 'Jumping off the gw bridge, sorry.'

The trial is expected to delve into text messages, tweets and online chats from Clementi and Ravi.
