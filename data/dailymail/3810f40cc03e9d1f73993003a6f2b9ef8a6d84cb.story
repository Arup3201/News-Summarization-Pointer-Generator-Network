A thief who stole a teenager’s first car unwittingly helped bring down his insurance costs - by scoring a perfect ten out of ten on the vehicle’s ‘black box’ safety system.

Alex Cooper, 17, was left distraught when his prized £13,000 Vauxhall Corsa was taken from outside the skip hire company in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he works.

But the teenager, who had a ‘black box’ unit installed to reduce his insurance costs by analysing his driving, was able to track down the vehicle using the system’s Global Positioning System feature.

Recovered: Alex Cooper, 17, and his mother Kimberley, 43, with their £13,000 Vauxhall Corsa, which was stolen from outside the skip hire company in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where the boy works

The unit works like a plane’s black box flight recorder - measuring speed, acceleration, smoothness and control, before giving a score for each journey.

Alex found his limited-edition Corsa in nearby Shaw, Oldham, three hours after it was taken - and it later emerged the thief had scored a perfect ten out of ten for safe driving before ditching it.

Alex, from Moorside, Oldham, only managed 7.9 on the way to work. The unit, which allows Alex to monitor his performance via a phone app, means he can earn cashback for good driving.

His insurance firm Carrot said he would be allowed to keep the thief’s score on his record. Alex said: ‘I found it quite funny that he drove better than me.’

Alex only passed his test in February and it costs him around £2,400 a year for insurance on the Corsa, which is owned by his mother Kimberley, 43, a hairdresser.

They were able to find out from the black box's GPS feature that the car was stolen at 10.55am on May 8 and abandoned around four miles away later that day at 11.12am - 17 minutes later.

The Corsa, which had its passenger window smashed and ignition tampered with, was left with an estimated repair bill of around £2,000.

His mother said: ‘We were absolutely mortified, it’s our pride and joy. But we laughed when we found it had been driven so carefully. We can only think they’ve driven like that to not arouse suspicion.’

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said that no arrests had been made over the theft.

Black box-style systems have already been fitted in many vehicles to monitor the number of journeys made, the time of day and driving behaviour such as speed and braking.

The technology, known as telematics, will have to be included as standard to all new cars under EU regulations from October next year to help emergency services find crashed vehicles.

Insurers have urged motorists with older vehicles to fit them voluntarily because they make premiums cheaper for safer drivers. Experts say around half of all cars will have the monitoring equipment by 2020.

Drivers are scored on a range of behaviours, and receive money back on their insurance if they drive safely.

Estimates suggest that young drivers should see their annual premiums fall by 20 per cent.

An analysis of 10,000 young driver claims by the Co-operative Insurance in 2012 also  suggested that those with telematics insurance are 20 per cent less likely to have a car crash than those with standard insurance.

They also tend to be involved in less serious road accidents, as the cost of a typical insurance claim from a customer with the box is 30 per cent less than from a customer without.
