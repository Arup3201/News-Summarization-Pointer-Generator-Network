Romelu Lukaku says Ross Barkley is the perfect number 10 and has backed the 20-year-old to become England’s best player.

Barkley made his first Premier League appearance of the season on Saturday after a long injury layout, and Lukaku heaped praise on the youngster in the aftermath of the Toffees 3-0 win over Aston Villa.

'He is like a friend and brother to me off the pitch,' Lukaku told evertonfc.com. 'I am very happy that he is back on it because he brings something that the whole team needs.'

Lukaku claimed that Barkley is the best player in the Everton team, and that England will rely on him

Lukaku became Everton's record signing in the summer when he made his move permanent to the tune of £28 million, but the Belgian believes that it is in fact Barkley who is the best player in the team.

'He has that rawness, that skill, that power. He is a perfect partner for me to play up front with and I am very happy that he is back.

'There are loads of players who can help me, but he has something that none of us have. I can’t explain it. He is the best player in our team.'

Barkley has made nine appearances for England since his maiden call-up in August 2013, and Lukaku believes that he will become the centrepiece of the international team in the future.

'He will be somebody that the England team will rely on. At the moment, they rely on Wayne Rooney, but I think that will be Ross in the future.'

Barkley has made nine appearances for England, but got injured in August and has missed all Euro qualifiers
