Few things trump a mother's love, as these heart-warming images of an otter and her pup show.

The mother and her whelp were spotted floating down a river with the young pup using its mother as a raft. 

The cute family moment was captured by Geraldine Davies while on a sailing dingy in Monterey, California.

Geraldine, 53, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, said, 'I live on a sailing boat with my husband and we were out in Monterey Harbour on our dingy when when we came across this mother and her pup resting under the boardwalk.

'We watched her every day for about three weeks and eventually she was quite comfortable with us being so close.'

Geraldine added, 'It was a very special experience, especially as she had a pup.'
