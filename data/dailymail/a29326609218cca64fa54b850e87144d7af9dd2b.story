It's all but guaranteed Samsung is launching a new Galaxy device on Monday - and following two invitations, the firm has now released a teaser trailer for its upcoming product.

The 36-second trailer features a series of images and titles with the number five written beside each one, including 'wet', 'connect', 'social' 'seflie', 'focus' and more.

It's uncertain whether these are just marketing buzz words, or hint at features, but if it's the latter the phone may be waterproof, have improved sharing features, and an improved camera.

The 36-second trailer features a series of images and titles with the number five written beside each one, including 'wet', pictured, 'social' 'seflie', and more. It's unsure whether these are just marketing buzz words, or hint at features, but if it's the latter the phone may be waterproof, for example

The handset is expected to be announced on February 24, and go on sale worldwide in April.

Rumours suggest it will have a 5.25inch QHD (2,560×1,440) Super AMOLED display.

It is expected to run the Exynos 6/Snapdragon 805 processor and feature a 16MP camera - up from 13MP on the Galaxy S4.

Any new Touchwiz interface will be laid on top of the latest version of Android 4.4, also known as KitKat.

The casing of the Galaxy S5 may also come in plastic, following suit from previous models of the phone, as well as metal to rival the iPhone 5S.

Rumours claim the Korean tech giant will 
launch the Galaxy S5 phone during an event in Barcelona next week, and 
the use of the number five in the video adds even more weight to this.

Samsung sent journalists invitations to a
 'Samsung Unpacked' event at the Mobile World Congress show in 
Barcelona, last month.

An invitation to the event's live webcast was then posted on Samsung's official blog. 

This second invitation hinted the software on the S5 might have a new layout and the teaser featured nine rounded app icons - current icons are a mixture of shapes.

These
 icons were also 'flatter' in design, similar to those seen on Apple's 
iOS 7 software, having previously been designed with shadowing to give 
them a 3D appearance.

The apps listed were Speed, Curiosity, Fun, Outdoor, Social, Style, Privacy, Fitness and Life. Curiosity, Fun and Social are also featured in the latest video.

These icons also appeared to be colour coded, with apps relating to features of the phone -  Privacy, Speed, and Curiosity - shown in blue.

A number of the titles relate to photos, and photo features, including this 'selfie' slide. Rumours state the phone will have a 16MP camera - up from 13MP - and these slides bolster these claims

Outdoor, Style and Fitness were shown in green, while the Social icon is yellow, Fun is purple and Life is red.

This
 new look suggests the Touchwiz interface used across Samsung's devices 
will be redesigned for the S5 - or whichever device the firm announces.

Touchwiz is a skinned version of Google Android, designed specifically for Samsung gadgets. It makes it stand out from the traditional Android used on Nexus devices, for example.

The
 icons on the webcast invitation also hinted at what Samsung wants to promote as the 
phone's main features, namely speed and privacy. Meanwhile, Curiosity 
could hint towards a new search feature.

Samsung unveiled the teaser invitation, pictured, on its official blog. It features rounded icons for Samsung apps, and hints towards a new-look version of its Touchwiz interface. Touch Wiz is a skinned version of Google's Android operating system. The icons also have the 'flatter' design seen in Apple's iOS 7

It's not surprising Samsung may be looking to improve its Touchwiz interface.

Last November, vice chairman Kwon Oh-hyun admitted that the software is poor, and that the firm is better at designing hardware than developing software.

The Korean firm is expected to use the event to reveal its Galaxy S5 alongside a new, curved version of its Galaxy Gear watch.

It has already been claimed the handset could have a new 'smart' home screen that changes depending on the user's location, or what they are doing.

An image obtained by website @evleaks,
 shows a home screen displaying a series of cards, similar to how Google
 Now works; showing nearby locations as well as information gleaned from
 apps about what the user is doing.

For
 example, it shows details of the user's latest run, a flight they plan to 
catch and text messages from friends. This could be a major overhaul for Samsung's flagship handset, if it is legitimate.

Leaks of Samsung's new menu system show a series of 'smart cards' showing information to users than can change depending on where they are or what they are doing. This is similar to how Google Now works

The specs for Samsung's new Galaxy S5 
have also already leaked online, amid claims the handset will come in both 
metallic and plastic versions.

The
 handset is expected to have a 5.25-inch screen - up from the S4's 5-inch display - use iris 
scanning to recognise users without a password, and will run a 
superfast Snapdragon processor.

There is also expected to be a mini version of the S5, and a camera version called the Zoom, according to the Sammobile web site.

The metal version is expected to cost around 800 Euros (£657) and the
 plastic model is rumoured to cost around 650 Euros (£535).

By comparison, the metal Phone 5S starts at £549.

If true, Samsung's move is identical to Apple's decision to launch a plastic iPhone 5C alongside its flagship 5S model last year.
