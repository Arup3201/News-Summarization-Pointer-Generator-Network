Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has launched an extraordinary rant against his own customers – branding those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘idiots’ who should ‘b***** off’.

The outspoken chief executive of the budget airline said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘stupid’ and it is right they are charged £60 a time to have one printed at the check-in desk because it is their ‘**** up’.

His remarks came after passenger Suzy McLeod was forced to pay £236 to print boarding passes for herself, her parents, and her two children so they could fly home to Britain from Alicante, Spain.

Not impressed: Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary has declared that his passengers who don't like paying for printed boarding passes should 'bu**er off'

Mr O’Leary said: ‘Mother pays £200 for
being an idiot and failing to comply with her agreement at the time of 
booking. We think Mrs McLeod should pay €60 (£47.40) for being so 
stupid.’

Mrs McLeod, 35, from Newbury, 
Berkshire, criticised Ryanair’s rule and said she was unable to print 
her family’s passes while they were in Spain for 15 days last month.

She
was backed by more than 350,000 Facebook users after complaining of her
‘unfair’ treatment by the Irish no-frills airline, which has been 
frequently criticised for its extra charges.

But Mr O’Leary said she should have 
printed the passes at an internet cafe or asked a friend to print and 
fax them to her.

Instead, he said, ‘she then comes home and gets on 
Twitter, God help us all, and somehow we are going to change our 
policies. No, we’re not’.

He said Mrs McLeod, who was staying at
a rural villa without internet access, had written to him last week to 
ask for ‘compensation and a gesture of goodwill’.

Mr O’Leary, 51, said 
the airline has replied, ‘politely but firmly’, saying: ‘Thank you Mrs 
McLeod, but it was your **** up.’

He admitted she was not alone in 
complaining about the rule, but said the 0.02 per cent of his 
passengers, which equates to 15,800 of its 79million, who do not print 
off passes every year should ‘b***** off’.

Mrs McLeod said: ‘His comments say a 
lot about his airline. They’re so rude.

'Why should anyone have to spend 
their precious time abroad having to find a cafe or a hotel to print out
a boarding pass?’.
