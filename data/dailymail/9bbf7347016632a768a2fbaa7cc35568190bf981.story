After his grand arrival into rugby union, Sam Burgess will prepare to enter a school of hard knocks in a ‘padded cell’ with Bath’s back-rowers, while his new club may find themselves on a collision course with England.

The world player of the year in league was unveiled amid great fanfare at The Rec and he handled the glare of attention with considerable aplomb, despite the jetlag induced by a long-haul trek from Sydney. There was ample diplomacy as he explained his cross-code move and ambitions, but the subject of his likely position in the 15-man game kept recurring as a potential sticking point.

Stuart Lancaster, the England head coach, would welcome the prospect of Burgess making a late charge for World Cup selection in midfield, and at the start of this season it appeared Bath were ready to co-operate by deploying him at inside centre. But, amid a spate of back-row injuries, now it appears they may revert to their initial intention by unleashing him at No 8, whether that is in the national interest or not.

Having welcomed his new recruit, Bath head coach Mike Ford emphasised the club’ s right to harness his imposing presence as they see fit, having had to stump up the full transfer fee without assistance from the RFU. Whether or not a padded cell actually awaits Burgess, what does is a crash-course in the breakdown and other aspects of back-row play, just in case that is where he is employed.

Asked where the newcomer would play, Ford said: ‘If you want my gut feeling, I think Sam’s going to play in the back row. I’ve got a good relationship with Stuart, but we have not really talked about Sam positionally, only “when is he coming, is he healthy and do you need any help in the way you develop him, we can help in that respect”. But the decision will be Bath’s and Sam’s. I can afford to experiment and see what the best position is.

‘We have quite a few back-row players injured and we have a padded cell which we will put them in over the next few weeks so the guys can take Sam to one side and say, “This is how you present the ball, this is how we clear”.’

The 25-year-old played 13 times  for the England rugby league side, and also played twice for Great Britain

1. He can be a bit of a teacher’s pet. Growing up watching rugby league, his favourite player was former Wigan star Andy Farrell, which could be a popular choice if Burgess is called up for England — Farrell is the backs coach for the national team. 

2. He’s not always been so keen on a cross-code switch. In a Q&A in 2009, the former Bradford Bulls man was asked about whether he was concerned too many players were swapping rugby league for rugby union. He said: ‘It is definitely something rugby league as a sport should be worried about. I played a little bit of rugby union when I was younger, but I’m definitely on the side of league.’ 

3. He made a flying start to his league career. In 2007, as a strapping 18-year-old, he made a spectacular international debut for Great Britain, scoring in a 20- 14 win over New Zealand. The last 18-year-old to score on debut against the Kiwis? A certain Andy Farrell. 

There is still a chance that once Burgess is fit to start his union career after recovering from facial surgery, he will first surface at centre for Bath, but the uncertainty is not good news for England. The national coaches will be desperate to see him wear No 12 as soon as possible, but the man himself was at pains to play down his Test hopes — well aware it would not send out the right message at his new club to suggest he wants to run before learning to walk in the rival code.

However, England’s autumn internationals last year played a part in convincing him to cross the divide. ‘I did see the games — I was in the country,’ he said. ‘I did think it was fantastic, the way it was built up at Twickenham; it looked like a fantastic experience to be a part of. I guess that’s one great thing about rugby union.

‘But I’m here now as a Bath player. I’ve been asked a lot about England but for now it’s important to sort this face out, get some fitness back in, get in the padded cell, earn the respect of the boys and let them know I’m here for the right reasons.’

Outlining the motivation behind leaving league, he added: ‘I’ve always had an ambition to play union. I didn’t think it would come this early. I came back at the end of 2013 to play in the Rugby League World Cup and I really missed England and English people.

‘I saw Mike and Bruce (Craig — club chairman) at Bath and I saw it as an opportunity. I believed in the vision they had for the club and thought it was a great fit. My goal at the moment is to get fit and find a spot in Mike’s team. I don’t know where that is yet. Over time we’ll work that out.’

Burgess has made his move after some time off to recuperate from his operation, having broken a cheekbone and eye socket during his man-of-the-match contribution to the South Sydney Rabbitohs’ first NRL title in 43 years.

He spent some time with club owner and film star Russell Crowe on his farm — ‘we had a couple of beers together, we had a good time’ — before flying home to embrace this new challenge.

He declared himself at ease with the pressure which will accompany him in union and backed his ability to learn a whole new ball game. ‘It is not going to be an easy transition,’ said the man known as Slammin’ Sam. ‘But I don’t lack belief.’ There has been contact with the England coaches, but Burgess played down the significance of their conversations. He said Lancaster had merely called him a few times to say ‘G’day’ and his mistaken use of the Australian phrase brought a laugh. It will take time to acclimatise to being back in this country, let alone being in the other code.

Asked if any of his three brothers who are still at the Rabbitohs might be tempted to head home and turn their hands to union, Burgess said: ‘I don’t think so! Thomas and George are living on Coogee beach and loving it in Australia. My oldest brother (Luke) has settled down and has a family in Sydney.’

So Sam appears to be the only member of the clan who will make this leap into the unknown, at least for the time being. But for Bath and for England, wherever he ends up playing, this big brother could be a revelation. Time will tell.
