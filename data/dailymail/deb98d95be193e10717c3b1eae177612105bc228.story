John William Davies, pictured, may have been trapped in his car on a remote country lane for two weeks after going missing

A pensioner suffering early-stage dementia probably spent two weeks trapped on farmland in his broken-down car before dying of pneumonia, an inquest heard.

John William Davies, 78, suffered hallucinations the night before he disappeared and had probably become disorientated when he became stuck in a remote country lane.

There was evidence that he was still alive a day or two before his body was found in the Nant-y-Moch area of mid-Wales.

Mr Davies had been missing for 15 days
when he was found in his Rover on farmland between Caer Arglwyddes and 
Blaen Clettwr fawr, Nant-y-Moch, by Alan Lloyd Williams who was out 
moving sheep.

Police had 
been searching for Mr Davies, a grandfather of five and former 
policeman, since he disappeared from his home at Ty Mawr Y Llan, 
Llancynfelin, on Monday, 12 March.

The
inquest was told that he had been having hallucinations the night 
before he went missing and that could have been a sign of dementia, 
which caused him to get lost or disorientated.

Ceredigion Coroner Peter Brunton said there was also evidence to suggest Mr Davies died just days before his body was found.

The cause of death was found to be 
bronchopneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia and 
ischemic heart disease.

Mr Davies' wife, Margaret, said he had
been in good spirits before he disappeared, but suffered from 
hallucinations the night before.

She said: 'He was talking to people who were not there.

'I asked if I should get the on-call doctor but he declined, saying it was too late.

'We went to bed. When I woke at 8.30am, John and the car had gone.'

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Mr Brunton said: 'This is quite a strange state of affairs.

'The postmortem gives the cause of death quite clearly.

'The
difficult part is that although he was missing for two weeks, the 
pathologist believes death was only one or two days before he was 
found.'

Having visited the
farmland where Mr Davies was found, he added: 'It is incredible he 
managed to drive a normal family car down there.

'When police tried to remove the car, the battery was flat and there was insufficient oil, suggesting the engine had seized.

'In my view, he would never have been able to drive back up the track, which begs the question, why didn't he walk?

'The only clue, perhaps, is that he was suffering from dementia.'

Nant Y Moch is located near the west coast of Wales
