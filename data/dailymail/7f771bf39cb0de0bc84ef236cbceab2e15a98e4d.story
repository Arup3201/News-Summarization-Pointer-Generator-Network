A man busted on drug charges Tuesday was snapped in his booking photo wearing a shirt that read 'Go Directly to Jail.'

The photo of 20-year-old Micah Dailey was included in an inmate detail page with the Lee County Sheriff's Office in Florida.

Dressed to impress: Micah Dailey's booking photo shows he was arrested wearing a shirt that says 'Go Directly to Jail' 

Dailey was booked on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge of no more than 20 grams, along with a felony drug equipment possession charge, according to the page.

The image on his shirt is from the board game Monopoly.

He was arrested at 12:40am and released at 7:13pm, according to the inmate detail page.

The Cape Coral man is now out on $6,500 bond, with a December 1 planned, the page said.

Sgt. Scott Lineberger told The New York Daily News, which first reported the story, that police found the shirt funny.

'It had an element of humor to it,' he told the newspaper.
