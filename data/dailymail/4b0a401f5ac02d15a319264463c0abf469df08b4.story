The federal government has fast-tracked new laws forcing telecommunication companies to retain metadata for police and intelligence agency investigations.

Police and spy agencies will have a better chance of catching terrorists and other criminals under the new mandatory data retention scheme, according to the federal government.

Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull introduced the draft laws to parliament designed to give agencies greater investigative powers and require telcos to keep metadata for at least two years.

Attorney-General George Brandis would not be drawn on whether a specific recent incident has been the reason for the laws being fast-tracked saying 'it is a law of general application but the government doesn't need legislation to do this'

Attorney-General George Brandis would not be drawn on whether a specific recent incident has been the reason for the laws being fast-tracked saying 'it is a law of general application but the government doesn't need legislation to do this'.

Law enforcement agencies have been critical of telcos erasing their metadata - background information about phone calls and text and internet messages - saying this has deterred major investigations into terrorism and child exploitation.

The laws were expected to be introduced in 2015 after further consultation but were instead rushed into parliament on Thursday after a brief coalition party room meeting.

Metadata is believed to have played a central role in most counter-terrorism, espionage and organised crime investigations.

ASIO boss Duncan Lewis said 'we have had four major mass casualty plans in this country, all of these were thwarted by access to metadata'

Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull stressed access to the metadata content would require a warrant

Metadata can be used by spy agencies to check whether Australian radicals are communicating with militants in the Middle East

'We have used the metadata for over half a century .. and seek to have continuing access to metadata stores,' said ASIO director general Duncan Lewis.

'We have had four major mass casualty plans in this country, all of these were thwarted by access to metadata.

'The seriousness of the crimes that are resolved through the access to metadata is critical.' 

Although it is unclear exactly what constitutes metadata, it will not include web browsing history, website addresses (URLs) or the content of calls and emails, reports the Brisbane Times.

Mr Turnbull stressed that any official access to the content would require a warrant. 

'No responsible government can sit by while those who protect our community lose access to the tools they need to do their job,' he said.

'In the current threat environment we cannot let this problem become worse.'

There will be independent oversight of the laws and the Attorney-General's department must report each year on the scheme's operation.

A draft dataset and the bill will be referred to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security.

Doubts surface. The new legislation comes after Opposition Leader Bill Shorten revealed he's had second thoughts about an earlier tranche of the government's national security laws

The new legislation comes after Opposition Leader Bill Shorten revealed he's had second thoughts about an earlier tranche of the government's national security laws.

Mr Shorten has written to Prime Minister Tony Abbott to raise concerns over legislation passed by parliament last month that could see journalists jailed for up to ten years.

But Senator Brandis said that a national security legislation monitor will soon be put in place and part of that role is to allay fears that journalists may be prosecuted for doing their job. 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop expressed shock at a new on-line video showing children as young as six spouting anti-Western rhetoric and waving extremist flags in Lakemba in Sydney's south west last year

Julie Bishop said children shouldn't be 'enlisted by irresponsible adults to an ideology that preaches hatred against the country in which they live'

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Mr Shorten was playing politics with national security.

Ms Bishop also expressed shock at a new on-line video showing children as young as six spouting anti-Western rhetoric and waving Islamic extremist flags in Lakemba in Sydney's south west last year.

In the YouTube footage, four boys aged six to 13 wave flags, including that used by Islamic State, and chant 'You're never too young to be a Soldier for Khilafa'.

Ms Bishop said children shouldn't be 'enlisted by irresponsible adults to an ideology that preaches hatred against the country in which they live'.

Mr Lewis added that the data 'is critical to ASIO's work, for us to perform our function, to protect Australians and Austrlaian interest, we need this access'.
