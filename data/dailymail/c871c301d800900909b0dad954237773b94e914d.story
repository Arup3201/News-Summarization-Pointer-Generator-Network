Fresh from winning more than £2million on NFL betting, Floyd Mayweather flew into Los Angeles on Tuesday and threw thousands into the air at a famous strip club.

The action, known as 'making it rain', secured the American boxer a legion of new fans in LA, as people clamoured to pick up the notes he threw to the floor at Sam's Hofbrau.

Mayweather, the world's highest-paid sportsman, recently won £895,000 ($1.4m) when the Denver Broncos beat the New York Jets by more than 7.5 points, after betting £506,000 ($815,000).

Mayweather's astonishing run of form betting on the NFL has seen him take home £2.03million ($3,267,637.36) in three weeks.

He had already banked £1.13m ($1,825,714.28) before the Broncos bet came in, after successfully betting on both the Seattle Seahawks and the Indianapolis Colts to win by more than 7.5 points.

Last week Mayweather vowed to 'shut up' and 'punish' Amir Khan in a fight his dad Floyd Mayweather Snr is 'desperate' to see him accept.

Khan remains hopeful he will one day fight the undisputed pound-for-pound world No 1 after coming close to facing Mayweather earlier this year.
