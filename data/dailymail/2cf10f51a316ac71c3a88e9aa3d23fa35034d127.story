A British woman arrested in Iran after attending a men’s volleyball match has gone on trial today.

Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, appeared before a judge accused of ‘propaganda against the regime’ – a charge which can carry a one-year jail sentence.

The London graduate was detained as she and women’s rights campaigners tried to enter the Azadi Stadium in Tehran to watch a volleyball game.

Under Iran’s strict Islamic laws, women are forbidden from mixing with male spectators at sporting events.

Miss Ghavami was released on bail but then arrested when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station a week later, when the authorities discovered she had dual British-Iranian citizenship.

She was thrown into solitary confinement in Iran’s notorious Evin political prison and has been held for more than 100 days, including 41 days in solitary.

Miss Ghavami, a law graduate from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, carried out a 14-day hunger strike in protest against her detention.

Her British-born mother Susan, 49, said the hunger strike had now ended and the family hoped to learn the court’s verdict next week.

Writing to her daughter’s supporters on Facebook, Mrs Ghavami said: ‘Today was my daughter’s court day. It was not a public court sessions.

‘Before the commencement, when they brought Ghoncheh, I laid a kiss on her beautiful face and gave her as much comfort as I could in that brief time.’

The family were not allowed inside the courtroom for the 90-minute trial but Mrs Ghavami said they were allowed a brief and emotional family reunion once the session had finished.

She said: ‘All of us gathered together for 20 minutes, [the] first time in hundred something days. Ghoncheh kept kissing her grandfather who she hasn’t seen for all these 109 days and kept weeping.’

Mrs Ghavami, who met and married Iranian surgeon Houshang Azam Ghavami after moving to Iran, said she had hand-fed her daughter to assure herself that her hunger strike was over.

The family has spoken of their fears for her health after saying she seemed pale and weak during a prison visit.

Iran’s judiciary denies that the charges against Miss Ghavami are linked to her attempts to watch the Iran-Italy volleyball match in June.

She is accused of ‘propaganda against the regime’ in the Islamic republic and a spokesman said the charge was linked to national security.

Protest: Social media campaigns have sprung up in a bid to pressurise Iran into releasing Miss Ghavami

Iran does not recognise dual nationality and views Miss Ghavami as an Iranian citizen, but Prime Minister David Cameron has raised her case with Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani when the two leaders met last month.

Miss Ghavami’s family has said she supports the Iranian president and has appealed for her release.

Her mother wrote: ‘The judge has arranged to give a verdict next week. I hope that by now next week this nightmare is over and my daughter is in my arms. Keep me in your prayers.’

Speaking before the hearing, her brother Iman, 28, said Miss Ghavami had only been allowed to meet her lawyer two days before the trial.

He said she travelled to Iran to work for a charity teaching literacy to street children.

Mr Ghavami, of Shepherds Bush, West London, said his sister had thought women were allowed to attend international volleyball matches and has called her arrest was ‘a truly tragic misunderstanding’.

A petition organised by the family has gathered more than 600,000 signatures and Mr Ghavami told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘We want the authorities to know the whole world is watching.’
