A newly-appointed fire chief investigating a porn scandal involving two fire trucks has admitted that he also took part in 'inappropriate' photos.

Chief Brian Cummings says that 13 years ago, while serving as a captain with the Los Angeles Fire Department, he allowed pictures to be taken of himself with a bikini-clad woman.

The pictures were taken in front of a fire engine and firefighters under his command were present, he said.

I'm sorry: Chief Brian Cummings has imposed a community service penalty on himself to reinforce 'the public's trust' in him

Cummings admitted to the photos Friday, just two weeks after it was revealed that two other LA fire stations allowed their engines to be used in two porn movies.

The chief said he allowed the woman to pose partially naked in front of the engine, violating LAFD policy.

Cummings said he is punishing himself by volunteering to do 120 hours of community service to reinforce 'the public's trust' in him.

He said on Friday: 'This is clearly irresponsible and inappropriate.

'I am accountable for my actions.'

The department had promised to fully investigate the alleged misconduct over the porn movie, but said their investigation had hit a dead end, because it failed to identify firefighters who might have taken part in the porn movies, msnbc.com reports.

Cummings ruled that that no firefighters would be disciplined because of a two-year statute of limitations on acts of misconduct.

Two engines at two firehouses in Los Angeles were involved in the porn scenes

The porn movies were made in 2008.

Following the porn and picture incidents, Cuimmings has pledged he will present a new Code of Conduct to the LA Fire Commission.

He also plans to provide ethics training to all department personnel.

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said in a statement: 'I have accepted Chief Cumming's apology, and I support his proposesd steps to rebuild the public's confidence in his professionalism.'

The two firehouses in question were in Venice and Hollywood and featured adult star Charley Chase.
