Another top BBC executive has been found guilty of bullying staff, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Mark Sandell, a senior editor and partner of Radio 5 Live presenter Victoria Derbyshire, also faces claims of sexual harassment against a female employee.

Last night, the BBC also confirmed that his expenses claims were being scrutinised.

Under scrutiny: Mark Sandell, a senior editor at the BBC and partner of radio host Victoria Derbyshire

The latest investigation follows outrage after BBC bosses were accused last week of ‘fudging’ the case of Newsbeat editor Rod McKenzie. He moved to another job after he was found to have  bullied several staff. There are wider concerns of a bullying culture at the organisation.

Some staff feel the decision not to sack McKenzie contradicts assurances by Lord Hall, the BBC director-general, who said there would be a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to bullying last year.  Last night, a BBC insider said: ‘The upshot is that staff will not bring cases forward now. That is the most damaging thing.’

After a lengthy process involving Mr Sandell, editor of the BBC’s World Have Your Say, a disciplinary upheld a bullying claim but is still looking at the allegation of sexual harassment, it can be revealed.

Separately, it is understood Mr  Sandell’s expenses are still being investigated by the BBC’s Investigation Unit.

Mr Sandell, who remains in his job while the various disciplinary processes conclude, was married to BBC presenter Fi Glover for two years. He left her in 2002 for BBC Radio 5  presenter Ms Derbyshire, with whom he has two children.

World Have Your Say, which broadcasts on radio on The World Service and TV on BBC World News, is one of the Corporation’s flagship shows abroad and is watched and listened to by millions of people worldwide.

One well-placed source said: ‘Mr Sandell is someone who is known to have had a reputation for as long as he has been at the BBC. He was at 5 Live and other parts of the BBC and his reputation goes before him.

‘There have been previous complaints [of bullying] against him.’

It is not known if these claims have ever been investigated.

Rod McKenzie was moved from his job as head of Newsbeat, Radio 1’s news bulletin, after being investigated for more than 30 complaints.

Mr McKenzie denied the allegations, some of which were not upheld, but was given a final written warning and posted to another, as yet undisclosed, post.

But some who complained have accused the BBC of failing to protect whistle-blowers, adding management appeared to side with Mr McKenzie, who has taken a month’s leave.

Ceri Thomas, the BBC’s head of programmes, briefed Newsbeat staff on the McKenzie situation last week and said Mr McKenzie had ‘many more expressions and testimonials of support than criticism’. One complainant, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It is outrageous for someone from management to say that. Obviously those that gave testimonials were not the ones who were bullied.’

Another BBC insider said the result of the McKenzie complaint would leave staff deflated.

The insider said: ‘People are very angry and the upshot is that staff will not bring cases forward now, that is the most damaging thing.’

A source close to Mr McKenzie said: 
'Rod rejects these claims and maintains that his behaviour was entirely in keeping with a pressured news environment.'

A former member of the Newsbeat staff defended Mr McKenzie, saying: 'The idea that there was a culture of paranoia and fear about Newsbeat is nonsense. There's a greater proportion of past and current staff who would describe him as an uncompromising but brilliant and inspiring boss. 

'Tough, yes, but always fair and wanting to get the very best out of everyone. My experience in Rod's newsroom set me and many others up to go and have successful careers elsewhere and still work by his high standards." 

Another former colleague added: 'He was always very encouraging to young talent and very supportive. I don't recognise these descriptions of his behaviour.'

Conservative MP Rob Wilson has written to Lord Hall about the McKenzie issue. He said: ‘This decision looks like a fudge and I’m sure that victims of bullying across the BBC will feel a sense of betrayal.

Sandell was married to BBC presenter Fi Glover for two years, but left her in 2002

‘It is bound to damage their confidence that their employer will stand up for them in cases of bullying.’

Following the Jimmy Savile scandal, the BBC commissioned Dinah Rose QC to look at its bullying and sexual harassment procedures.

The Respect At Work review, also known as the Rose report, received submissions from more than 930 individuals and made a series of recommendations, including resolving accusations within 30 days and launching a confidential hotline where staff can report abuse.

The investigations into the complaints against Mr Sandell have lasted at least six months to date, while Mr McKenzie’s case took almost a year to resolve. After the Rose review’s publication, Lord Hall said the report made ‘uncomfortable reading’. He said: ‘We need to be honest about our shortcomings and single minded in addressing them.

‘I want zero tolerance of bullying and a culture where people feel able to raise concerns and have the confidence that they will be dealt with appropriately.’

But last week the Department for Culture, Media and Sport revealed there were 42 incidents of whistle-blowing at the BBC in 2012, with 22 of these reported via the hotline. In the first nine months of 2013, the rate of calls fell to 23, with six coming through the hotline.

A BBC spokesman said the Corporation would ‘not comment on staff matters’. But he said: ‘Bullying or harassment will not be tolerated at the BBC. We are implementing all Respect at Work recommendations and the BBC is leading the industry in the way it supports staff with complaints. With ambitious targets and a raft of new support for staff we are committed to ensuring all complaints are dealt with as quickly and fairly as possible.’

Regarding why cases are taking too long to resolve, he added: ‘While we are committed to dealing with cases in a timely fashion, the most important factor is that they are considered properly and fairly.

‘For the most complex cases this may mean they could take longer than 30 days to consider, particularly where multiple interviews are needed. Also, some cases have involved a subsequent disciplinary and appeals processes.’
