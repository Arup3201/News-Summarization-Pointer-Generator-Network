Five people have been arrested in an alleged million-dollar LSD ring operating on a university campus.

Police, who are calling it the biggest bust of its kind for 15 years, say the ring had been selling drugs at Drexel University in Philadelphia, for more than a year.

Two of the five suspects are students from the university and have not been named. They led police to ring leaders Raphael Zappala, Joseph Dassay, and Wesley Crawford, who were arrested in an overnight raid on Monday.

Ringleader: Joseph Dassay, who is wanted in nine states, was also arrested after allegedly selling acid for $10 to $30 a hit mostly to Drexel University students

During the raid at an address on Florence Street, police seized 9,500 hits of acid worth $28,000 hidden in a Spongebob Squarepants book and $10,000 in cash.

Police
say Zappala, 33, Crawford, 34, and Dassay, 31, who is wanted in nine states, sold acid for $10 to $30 a hit mostly to Drexel University students.

It is estimated the defendants were making $5,000 to $15,000 a week.

'It's sad this was taking place 
on a campus of higher learning,' said  Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams.

'I hope the actions of a
few don't tarnish the image of educational excellence that we associate
with Drexel University.'

Investigators got wind of the ring back in January when a man, arrested by Upper Moreland Police  for suspected marijuana possession, informed them of the suspected ring at Drexel.

'The first informant that we spoke to from Upper Moreland put us in contact with the Drexel student who was the supplier for the Upper Moreland individual,' Brian Grady, head of the Dangerous Drug Offender Unit in the DA’s office told CBS Philadelphia.

'That Drexel student immediately began to cooperate with us as well, and led us into his source of supply, which was another Drexel student. He led us to his suppliers.'

Police say Dassay had his bags packed ready to flee when they raided the home.

A university spokesman said in a statement: 'Drexel University has a zero 
tolerance policy for any type of illegal activity and takes immediate 
disciplinary action, including criminal prosecution.

'Although
two Drexel students were involved, the masterminds of the operation 
arrested today were not affiliated in any way with Drexel and operated 
out of a house on 48th Street, not on the Drexel campus.

'When Drexel is made aware of any students 
participating in illegal behavior, the University places them on 
indefinite suspension pending the outcome of the investigation by 
Philadelphia and Drexel police.'

The accused ringleaders of the ring could face up to 100 years in prison if convicted.
