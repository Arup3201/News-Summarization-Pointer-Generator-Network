A surgeon has been banned from driving for 18 months after he was spotted 'falling out of his Porsche'.

Roman Miller, 48, was caught with an empty bottle of whisky in his gym bag after police were called when his sports car was seen being driven erratically in Plymouth, Devon.

The orthopaedic surgeon also had a hip flask 'full of alcohol' when police found him in the changing rooms of a fitness club on Sunday, Plymouth magistrates court heard today.

Roman Miller, 48, had been 'depressed' over the possible closure of his workplace in an NHS treatment centre

Mr Miller had been 'depressed' in recent weeks after his future was thrown into 'limbo' with the threatened closure of his workplace at an NHS treatment centre in Plymouth, the court was told.

Prosecutor Angela Furniss said police had been notified about a possible drink driver by members of the public.

'They observed the car coming to a complete stop, racing off at speed and mounting a kerb twice.'

She added witnesses saw Miller drive into the car park of Virgin Active Health Club at Derriford, Plymouth, and said he had been falling out of his Porsche and swaying as he made his way into the club.

'He was located in the changing rooms. There were visible effects of having alcohol: glazed eyes, unsteady on his feet and smelling of intoxication.

'He repeatedly told police they wouldn't be able to prove it as they didn't stop him while driving.'

He failed an initial breath test but failed to later provide a second sample to police after he was taken into custody on Sunday evening.

Miss Furniss said: 'When they looked in his bag there was an empty bottle of Grants whisky, a 70cl bottle of whisky and a hip flask full of alcohol.

'He was adamant he had done nothing wrong and it couldn't be proven he'd driven.'

Mr Miller gave a third breath test that night which was still high, she said.

Roger Page, defending, said Mr Miller had been feeling stressed about the uncertainty of his job at the NHS Peninsula Treatment Centre which could close next Spring because of falling waiting lists.

'For the last four weeks or so, workwise, he's been left in limbo. He has been getting depressed about that and the ramifications that may have.'

He said Mr Miller is seeking GP help to discuss his alcohol intake. 'He seems like a rational man who is starting to address his problem.'

Mr Miller, of Warspite Gardens, Plymouth, was banned from driving for 18 months, fined £1,000 for failing to give a breath sample and ordered to pay £205 in court costs.
