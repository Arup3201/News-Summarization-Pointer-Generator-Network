An airline pilot is due in court tomorrow after being arrested on suspicion of being drunk in charge of a plane.

The captain of the Pakistan International Airlines flight, which was due to fly from Leeds Bradford Airport to Islamabad on Wednesday night, will appear before Leeds magistrates tomorrow morning.

The 54-year-old pilot, from Pakistan, was arrested just after 10pm yesterday, apparently while making pre-flight checks in the cockpit of the Airbus 310 aircraft.

Police are said to have arrested the 54-year-old pilot in the cockpit at Leeds Bradford Airport, pictured

All 180 passengers on board at the time had to be taken off the plane and put up overnight in a hotel.

A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said: 'At about 10pm last night police were called to Leeds Bradford International Airport where they arrested an airline pilot on suspicion of carrying out an activity ancillary to an aviation function while impaired by drink.

'The 54-year-old man, from Pakistan, is currently in custody.'

Irfan Faiz, 54, from Pakistan, will appear before magistrates in Leeds tomorrow charged with carrying out an activity ancillary to an aviation function while impaired by drink.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
