Mortgages should be made more expensive and harder to obtain in regions where house prices are running out of control to prevent a new property bubble, experts said today.

The
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) called for the Bank of England to use its powers to limit lending in specific areas where prices are rising by more than five per cent a year.

But housing experts lined up to insist it was 'premature' to talk of a new boom, with some parts of the country seeing steep falls in house prices in the last year.

Land Registry statistics for June house prices show how increases are concentrated in small pockets, with most areas flat, or falling

In an explosive move, RICS says urgent action is needed by the Bank due to ‘a growing risk of another house price boom’.

It suggests the Bank of England could ban banks from lending more than 80 per 
cent of a property’s value.

It could also limit the number of years over which a mortgage would be paid back, pushing up the cost of monthly repayments.

Crucially, RICS said the policy could be introduced 
on a regional basis, if some areas of the UK are hit by rampant house 
price inflation but homeowners in other regions experience the opposite.

It raises the prospect of loans becoming more expensive in London and the South East to act as a 'speed bump' to slow rises in property values.

Bank of England governor 
Mark Carney yesterday signalled to MPs that he was open to moves to cool 
Britain’s housing market if it began to over-heat.

But he admitted that the recovery in house prices was not been enjoyed across every region.

'We need to be vigilant about this. There are big pockets of the country where there has not been any meaningful recovery in the housing market.'

The
institution warned that if action was not taken to control house 
prices, ‘another housing bubble, reckless bank lending and a dangerous 
build-up in household debt’ could cripple Britain again.

But
the move will draw protests from the generation of young people already
frozen off the property ladder by house price rises.

Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: 'The Government is already subsidising mortgages in an effort to stimulate demand, and if the Bank of England were to step in and limit house price increases then the state would be pressing the brake and the accelerator at the same time. 

'Policy makers need to recognise that we don’t need more controls on demand, we need fewer controls on supply.'

The Council of Mortgage Lenders has also played down talk of a bubble as 'premature', adding: 'We are a long way from such conditions and we do not imagine that Bank officials are losing sleep about current developments in the housing market.'

Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said: 'The conditions aren't there for a new boom in house prices.'

While house prices have risen slowly across the country, in London they have surged to levels higher than before the crash

Average house prices increased in seven of the nine English regions over the year to June 2013.

The
largest increase was London where prices were up 8.1 per cent, followed
by the West Midlands 3.1 per cent and the South East, 2.9 per cent.

But prices fell by 0.2 per cent in Yorkshire and The Humber and were unchanged in the South West.

With an average home now costing 
£170,000, nearly seven times the average full-time salary, the 
introduction of a compulsory deposit amount – such as 20 per cent – 
could make it even harder for young people to get on the property 
ladder.

Critics warn the housing market is 
already over-heating, with price rises in each of the past seven months,
largely fuelled by the Government’s interventions.

Grilled by MPs: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England

Under two controversial schemes, both called Help to Buy, people are being encouraged to buy a home with a deposit of just 5 per cent. The second scheme launches in January.

In Canada – where Mr Carney ran the Bank of Canada before coming to the UK in July – 100 per cent mortgages are banned and a minimum deposit of 20 per cent is needed if you are refinancing a loan, and 5 per cent on a new mortgage.

Grilled by Labour MP Pat McFadden about what he would do about ‘an unhealthy acceleration in house prices’, Mr Carney told the Treasury Select Committee that a ‘more intensive supervision of lending’ was possible.

One option is ‘some guidance provided in terms of loan-to-value ratios’, he said.

The loan-to-value ratio is the figure representing the size of deposit in relation to the property’s value. For example, a £10,000 deposit on a £100,000 home gives an ratio of 90 per cent.

But he added: ‘We do not have powers of direction in that regard, but certainly have an ability to observe and recommend if necessary.’

Joshua Miller, senior economist at 
RICS and author of the report, said capping house price inflation at 5 
per cent per year ‘would discourage households from taking on excessive 
debt out of fear of missing out on a price boom’.

At
present, house prices are rising by 6.2 per cent a year, but rose  by 
up to 30 per cent a year at the height of the boom a decade ago.

Still a dream: With an average home now costing £170,000, nearly seven times the average salary, the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount could make it even harder for youngster to get on the property ladder

But in a recent report, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: ‘Intervention to dampen buoyancy in some locations would almost certainly bear down on other local markets where activity is more subdued, unless carefully targeted.’

The number of first-time buyers getting a mortgage has hit the highest level since the credit crunch began in 2007 as banks are offering far more loans which need only a 5 per cent deposit. Before the credit crunch, there were 1,000 different types of 95 per cent loans. During the recession, it dropped to just three, but has rallied to 46.

█ Mr Carney admitted to MPs that savers had been hammered by record low interest rates designed to encourage people to spend.

He said thrifty savers and pensioners who have seen their nest eggs eroded by years of dismal returns and high inflation deserve ‘tremendous sympathy’.

But he said holding the Bank rate at rock bottom ‘encourages spending rather than saving’ and that the rates – which have been held at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – must not rise any time soon for fear of snuffing out the recovery.

Simon Rose, from campaign group Save Our Savers, said Mr Carney’s comments amounted to: ‘Spend as much as you can, even if it means borrowing to do it and maybe it will ginger up the economy.’
