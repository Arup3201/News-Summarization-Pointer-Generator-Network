He is known as 'Sir Hairdryer' for his habit of bawling football players out in the locker room.

But the long-serving Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that there is more to his unparalleled success than that - and surprisingly, it involves sensitivity.

Sir Alex, the most successful manager in British football history, collaborated with academics at America's prestigious Harvard Business School to give a fascinating insight into his 26-year career running what is one of the world's biggest sports franchises.

And while his technique does undoubtedly involve a lot of shouting badly-performing players out, it also involves compassion and praise.

'For a player - and any human being - there's nothing better than hearing "Well done",' Sir Alex told the researchers.

'Those are the two best words ever invented in sports.'

There's no doubting his approach works. 

Sir Alex Ferguson, who will be 71 
on New Year’s Eve, is known as the Premier League's greatest manager, 
and the researchers in Boston wanted to assess his hugely successful 
management style.

Manchester United's chief executive David Gill said: 'Steve Jobs was Apple. Sir Alex Ferguson is Manchester United.'

Challenge: Sir Alex Ferguson has had to change his approach over the years

Professor Anita Elberse and 
Tom Dye worked with Sir Alex for months to produce their study, entitled Sir Alex Ferguson: Managing Manchester United.

It reveals his blueprint for planning the season, match-day rituals, the 
players he targets, keeping control of the dressing room and the 
mistakes he made.

The study also shows how he prepares his team, the way he conducts his team-talks and 
how he changes a game's direction at half-time.

Sir Alex said: 'Players these days have lived more sheltered lives, so they are much more fragile now than 25 years ago.

‘I was very aggressive all those years ago. I am passionate and want to win all the time. But today I’m more mellow.

'And I can better handle those more fragile players now. There’s all this hype about hairdryers and anger and so on.

'You can't always come in shouting and screaming. That doesn't work.

'But
there’s another side to it, which is more in terms of how I have 
fostered relations with people and developed the team over the years.'

His longtime secretary Lyn Laffin told researchers: 'If someone knocks on his door and they have a problem, the first thing he does is turn the chair around and say "Sit down, let's talk".

Sir Alex also visited Harvard to take a class on management.

He
told the official college newspaper Harvard Gazette: 'When you're 
approached by an institution like Harvard, you know you are dealing with
top quality.

'I had to consider that I was opening myself up to something I've never done before.

'But at this stage of my life, I felt that I'm helping young people progress through their own routes to management, then ultimately that was an important and compelling factor for me.

'The part of the discussion from which I learned the most about myself was when they were discussing the balance between 'fear' and 'love' in my approach to managing people.

'If you look at my history, there's all this hype about hairdryers and anger and so on.

'But the students acknowledged another side to it, which is more apt in terms of how I've fostered relations with people and developed the team over the years.'

The Manchester United manager also gave an impromptu pep talk to the college's American football team.

Head coach Carl Junot said: 'They were expecting me to come in and given them the practice plan and in walks Alex Ferguson. They were blown away.'

Not always 'Sir Hairdryer': Sir Alex Ferguson shows compassion to his players, too

Sir Alex Ferguson was born in 1941 and managed Scottish clubs East Stirlingshire, St Mirren and Aberdeen before taking over from Ron Atkinson at Manchester United in 1986.

During his time at the club, he has notched up countless successes, including winning the Champions League twice, the Premier League 12 times, the FA Cup five times, and the League Cup four times.

Since 1986 Manchester United has won 37 pieces of silverware, whereas before he took over, the club won 23 trophies in 134 years.

In December 2010 Sir Alex overtook Sir Matt Busby to become the longest-serving manager of Manchester United.  Sir Matt was at the helm for 24 years, from 1945-1969.

In terms of longest-ever manager, Sir Alex is second only to Fred Everiss, who managed West Bromwich for 46 years from 1902.

Overall, Manchester United with Sir Alex in charge has played 1,471 matches, won 878, lost 263, and drawn 330.
