He was famous for singing about living in a 'yellow submarine'.

But in fact, for a period at least, the infamous founder of the Beatles lived in a yellow gypsy caravan.

John Lennon's eccentric caravan, which he had painted with a psychedelic design, was home to him and his family on holidays in the 1960s.

But after his assassination the caravan was acquired by fellow Beatle Ringo Star and never seen again.

Now, however, the yellow travelling carriage has been discovered - still in the same place it was left.

Ringo Star kept the carriage next to his swimming pool at his former home, in Cranleigh, Surrey.

When he sold his house, however, he left the caravan where is it was.

The house went on to be let out to tenants, complete with the rotting carriage beside the pool, but sadly hidden from the rest of the world.

Unlike John Lennon's psychedelic-painted Rolls Royce, which went on to be restored and sits in pride of place in a museum in New York, this vehicle had been left to rust and fade.

But all is 
not lost, since the job of restoring and selling the caravan has fallen 
to Alan Carr, from Ascot, Surrey - a local charitable figure who plans 
to raise funds from the find.

Clive
Mason, of Carr's Lettings in Virginia Water, Surrey, said: 'The 
property had previously been owned by Ringo Starr and the caravan was 
not removed when he sold the house.

'My landlord was aware that the 
caravan had been owned by the Beatles and had always had in mind to 
offer it to a charity to see if they were interested in renovating it 
for fundraising purposes.

'As it was in very dilapidated 
condition there was quite a lot of work to be done and he had never got 
round to doing himself, but he knew that it could be potentially of some
financial value if a suitable craftsman could do the rebuilding work 
required.

Some of the paint work is in great condition, while other parts will take a lot of work to restore

Restoration: While the gipsy caravan has been restored once before, it is clearly in need of further work to bring it back to its former glory

'When the house was sold last year, 
our landlord asked us to find a suitable home for the caravan and asked 
me if I knew of any charities that would be interested.'

So Mr Mason got in touch with fundraiser Mr Carr, who received the unexpected call while on an epic John 
O'Groats to Lands' End charity walk for prostate cancer.

Mr Carr said: 'It was one of those "could you repeat" moments. I simply could not believe what I was being told.'

Mr Carr has now been made the charitable
guardian of the remaining sections of the caravan and has been 
authorised to help the charities of his choice with any money made 
through the potential sale.

The 'Yellow Caravan' once set off on its own 'Magical Mystery Tour' - heading to the tiny private island of Dorinish in County Mayo, Ireland

Eventually the caravan made its way back to Ascot and stood in the garden of Tittenhurst Park until Lennon's assassination in New York in1980

He said: 'This caravan is a piece of Rock and Roll history and represents the spirit of its time.

'Ideally I would like to see it take 
pride of place in a cultural museum in Liverpool, the Beatles 
birthplace, where experts can decide if it should be returned to its 
original Sgt Peppers glory, but for charities' sake I will have to 
balance any interest very carefully.'

The glamorous vehicle was bought by Lennon in 1967 for his then four-year-old son Julian's birthday.

The 'Beatle's Yellow Caravan', as it was called at the time, was styled with Sgt Pepper psychedelic artwork, which Lennon also famously adorned his Rolls Royce with.

Originally called a Showman or Burton
caravan, it was repainted at a garage in Chertsey to Lennon's specific 
designs and was transported on the 24th of July 1967 to Tittenhurst Park
in Ascot where John lived with first wife Cynthia and son Julian.

This
caused much interest in the area with one local resident - a Mrs 
Kathleen Bolton - quoted as calling the caravan 'an absolute hideosity'.

However, the teenage fans who gathered 
at the gates of Lennon's estate were much more enthusiastic and Mrs 
Booth's threat to report the offending vehicle to the residents 
association was met with boos and jeers.

The last leg of its journey involved rafting the caravan across Clew Bay onto the island hideaway where Lennon and his family could enjoy it in peace.

Eventually the caravan made its way back to Ascot and stood in the garden of Tittenhurst Park until Lennon's assassination in New York in1980.

Fellow Beatle Ringo Starr then acquired it as part of the late Beatle's estate and discovered that the whole caravan was in a poor state of repair.

So he called in vintage caravan restorer John Pockett and commissioned him to make urgent repairs.

This took nearly a year but by September 1983 that caravan had been returned to its full glory and its last known location was next to Ringo's swimming pool.

But while Lennon's famous Rolls Royce is now prominently displayed in a museum in America, the mythical 'Yellow Caravan' remained 'lost'. Or so they thought.
