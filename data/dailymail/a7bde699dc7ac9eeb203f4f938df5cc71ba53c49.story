Manchester United right-back Rafael has admitted his team-mates have been educating him on the importance of the FA Cup.

Rafael travels to Yeovil with Louis van Gaal and Co looking to avoid an upset at Huish Park on Sunday, and the defender  has been told stories about Ryan Giggs in the competition previously.

Asked if the FA Cup is special for him, Rafael told United's official website: 'Yes, exactly, because they [the English players] talk to me about it.

'They talk about the goal Giggsy scored against Arsenal when he took his shirt off. I’ve watched it as well so you can see how special that was. 

'I want to be involved, I want to have more moments with the team like this. If I can be on the pitch when someone scores [a goal like that], it will be amazing.'

But would Rafael take his shirt off if he scores? 'Maybe, but I don’t think the manager would be happy because I would get a yellow card!'

Aside from Giggs's goal in United's 2-1 win in the FA Cup semi-final of 1999, Rafael admits he never realised the competition's importance until he moved to England.

'When I came to Britain I started to know more because in Brazil we knew about the FA Cup, but we didn’t know how big it was in England,' Rafael continues.

'It’s more the Premier League and the Champions League that we know about but when I came here, I saw how big it [the FA Cup] is. 

'When I get old and speak to my kids, if I can say I won everything with Manchester United it will be fantastic. It’s a trophy I’m looking to win, definitely.'
