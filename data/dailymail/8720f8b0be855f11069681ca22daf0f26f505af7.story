New Birmingham manager Gary Rowett is set to make Charlton defender Michael Morrison his first signing.

Morrison is close to completing a loan move to St Andrews until January.

Rowett is wasting no time in strengthening his squad following his arrival earlier this week.

Gary Rowett has been appointed the new manager of Birmingham after leaving his post at Burton Albion 

Michael Morrison and Guy Moussi have been highlighted as targets by Birmingham boss Gary Rowett

He is also interested in former Nottingham Forest midfielder Guy Moussi.

The Frenchman, 29, is without a club following his release from Nottingham Forest at the end of last season.

Rowett's first game in charge of the Blues is a trip to high-flying Wolves as they look to end a three-match losing run.
