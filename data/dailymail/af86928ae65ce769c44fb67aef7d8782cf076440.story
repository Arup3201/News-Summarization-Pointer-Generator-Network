An entire classroom of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School was spared after gunman Adam Lanza believed that the room was empty because a piece of black construction paper covered the door's window.

The Connecticut State Police investigation into Adam Lanza's killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School has revealed that he studied other mass killings from around the world intently

That chilling detail emerged yesterday as Connecticut State Police compile their report into the tragic sequence of events of December 14th during which Lanza killed 26-people, including 20-first graders before taking his own life as police officers arrived at the school.

Sources connected with the inquiry have outlined to The Hartford Courant what happened that morning after Lanza killed his mother, Nancy, in her bed and then set off to the school armed with an assault rifle, two pistols and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Arriving at Sandy Hook Elementary School at 9.35 a.m., Lanza, 20, shot through the glass windows at the school entrance and immediately encountered Principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Scherlach, who had been alerted by the gunfire.

He shot them both to death on sight.

Two teachers were also injured by ricocheting bullets from that initial burst of gunfire.

One had been in the school's meeting room with Hochsprung and Scherlach and was wounded in the leg.

The other was further down the hallway outside her classroom after rushing out on hearing the shots and was hit in the foot.

The member of staff who had been shot in the leg managed to crawl and call the police, which explains the rapid response time of law enforcement to the school.

Continuing down the corridor it was then that Lanza apparently walked by the classroom of Kaitlin Roig, who had closed her classroom door on hearing the gunfire.

The school had recently performed a practice lockdown drill and the black construction paper that had been put up on the door had been left there - leading Lanza to think the classroom was empty.

Roig and her class, sat in petrified silence while they heard Lanza continue past their door.

Lanza then walked into the classroom of substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau to find her and the terrified children huddled together at the back of the room trying to hide in a bathroom.

The deranged shooter killed Rousseau and all but one of her class.

The little girl escaped by playing dead and emerged from the school with her clothes covered in blood saying, 'Mommy, I'm okay, but all my friends are dead.'

She was the only survivor from a class of 16.

When asked by her parents what she saw, the unnamed girl said she saw someone who was 'angry' and 'very mad.'

According to the unnamed source familiar with the report, Lanza then walked back towards teacher Victoria Soto's class and upon entering encountered children cowering under their desks.

He fatally shot these students along with Soto and then dramatically his assault rifle jammed - allowing six children from the class to escape out of the classroom while he reloaded.

Police investigating the home of Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook Connecticut have uncovered a dossier regarding every mass murder inside and outside of the United States that he had compiled

Unknown to Lanza, Soto had placed five children in a closet before he entered and opened fire and they were found unharmed after authorities arrived.

Authorities have also dispelled the theory that Lanza was shooting at police as they arrived.

Despite bullets being fired out of the school as police rushed up the drive to the school, investigators now believe that Lanza was firing at a teacher who was standing by a window.

Realizing that police were closing in, Lanza then turned one of the two pistols he was carrying on himself less than five minutes after he began his killing spree and just as police were entering the building.

State police have periodically updated the victims' families as the investigation has unfolded. Danbury State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky has said he hopes that the final report on the massacre will be publishedÂ  by the end of June.

Outlining for the first time what happened that morning, police also have uncovered evidence that Lanza compiled a dossier of 'virtually every mass murder' in the United States and abroad prior to his killing spree according to a law enforcement source connected with the massacre inquiry.

While 20-year-old Lanza's obsession with Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik has already been made public, investigators revealed they have found reams of articles about multiple shootings, leading them to speculate he intended to outdo them all.

As
 part of their ongoing investigation, State Police sources have told the
 Stamford Advocate that Lanza was especially interested in the October 
2006 shooting that occurred in a one-room Amish schoolhouse in Lancaster
 County, Pennsylvania in 2006.

Gunman
 Charles Carl Robert IV burst into the school and took hostages and shot
 10 school girls, five fatally, before ending his own life.

'There was a lot of material on the Amish case,' the unnamed source revealed to The Stamford Advocate.

Last
 month it was reported that investigators discovered evidence that Lanza
 had studied Breivik's massacre of 69 people on Utoya Island in July 
2011 - the Norwegian killed 77 people in all, including eight in 
bombings in Oslo, which led to him being sentenced in August to 21-years
 in prison.

Coupled with
 the dossier of other mass shootings in the United States and elsewhere,
 police came to the conclusion that he was planning to kill more.

However, authorities are still trying to piece together information from Lanza's hard drive, which he destroyed before the massacre, to ascertain what he researched, who he may have corresponded with and what websites he visited.

Indeed, while compiling their investigation, police have discovered evidence that Lanza became extremely efficient in his mastery of his AR-15 Bushmaster assault - leading them believe he had been planning his assault for a long time.

The unnamed source said that Lanza used a technique called 'tactical loading', which means to put a fresh magazine into the weapon before emptying the previous one.

While many video game fans, such as Lanza was are familiar with this, to exhibit a proficiency in reality makes police think he had done it before.

'It's one thing to do it by pushing a button on a computer,' the source said to The Stamford Advocate.

'It's different in a shooting. You have to practice that to be as proficient as he was that morning.'

Lanza's killing spree lasted less than five minutes and during that time he fired 152 bullets into two classrooms in the Connecticut elementary school.

Lanza also had hundreds more rounds of ammunition on him and in the car that he drove to the school in.

While the unnamed source has said that Lanza obtained the guns from a vault his mother had in their home, police are unsure whether he simply knew the combination or if Nancy Lanza left it unlocked.
