A mother has hit out at the NHS for funding 'boob jobs for fame-hungry glamour models' while refusing to pay for surgery to help her disabled son walk.

Kirsty Harrington, 23, was astounded when she was told hospitals did not 'routinely fund' the type of surgery that could radically transform the life of her son Hayden.

The wheelchair-bound five-year-old has a type of cerebral palsy called spastic diplegia.

Furious: Kirsty Harrington's son Hayden has cerebral palsy and can only get around with a wheelchair or walking sticks. She was astounded to be told hospitals did not 'routinely fund' the type of surgery that could help Hayden walk

Unfair: Ms Harrington lambasted the NHS for 
funding 'boob jobs for fame hungry glamour models like Josie 
Cunningham', but not her son's surgery.  Earlier this year, Birmingham 
barman Sam Barton was branded Britain’s vainest man when he revealed he 
had a state-funded £5,000 nose job

This causes muscle stiffness, meaning he cannot walk more than a few steps unaided.

There is no cure for the condition but an operation called selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) could improve Hayden’s walking.

The procedure would release tension in 
his legs, allowing him to undergo more intensive physiotherapy to let 
him walk unaided – so he can try to fulfill his dream of playing football.

But NHS England will not fund SDR because the treatment is not considered to offer 'value for money or clinical effectiveness' compared to other procedures.

It was removed from a list of publicly-funded operations in April 2013 after a consultation.

Mrs Harrington is now launching a £25,000 fundraising drive to pay for her son's surgery privately.

Speaking about fury, she said: 'They will fund things like boob jobs on the NHS, but they won’t carry out surgery like this on all children who desperately need it. It is shocking.

'It’s disgusting that there are people who actually need operations and they can’t have them because the Government can’t fund it.

'But the NHS will pay for boob jobs for fame hungry glamour models like Josie Cunningham who just wants to be a celebrity and use the operation to make thousands of pounds for herself.

'Hayden’s life would be changed by the 
surgery but instead they are paying for people who want to copy TV stars
 to have nose jobs.'

Struggle: Hayden, pictured here aged one, can crawl, but cannot sit up properly or walk unaided as his condition causes muscle stiffness. There is no cure, but the procedure would release tension in his legs

Upset: Hayden (pictured left at nine months) is frustrated at not being able to do what other children can

Hayden lives with his mother, father Matt, 25 and four-year-old brother Callum, in Solihull, West Midlands.

He was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy when he was 18-months-old and has been undergoing regular physiotherapy ever since.

Hayden currently gets around with the help of a wheelchair or walking frames.

But his parents claim he could be able to walk unaided if he had the life-changing surgery.

Ms Harrington, his full-time carer, said: 'By cutting out the bad nerves, the good ones would be left intact, and his muscles would loosen.

'Hayden’s legs would be easier to move and he would be able to walk. He would have a much happier and easier life.

Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs.

The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system.

These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body.

Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut.

Due
 to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise 
procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a
 general anaesthetic.

Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.

'At the moment he is frustrated at not being able to do what other children can do.

'He can stand against furniture but cannot walk unaided. He bunny hops, or crawls, but can’t sit up properly.

'He goes to a mainstream school and they are very good, adapting things like sports days so he can take part. But it is very hard for him when he can’t keep up.'

Josie Cunningham sparked fury when she had her breasts enlarged from a 32A to 36DD on the NHS in 2009 - costing the taxpayer £4,800.

And last month the mother-of-two defended her decision to sell four tickets to the birth of her next child.

The part-time model has sold two for £5,000 and two for £10,000, which include permission to film and take photographs.

And she infuriated taxpayers earlier this year when she tweeted a snap of herself earlier with the caption: 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but tax payers will always fund me.'

Earlier this year, Birmingham barman Sam Barton was branded Britain’s vainest man when he revealed he had a state-funded £5,000 nose job.

The 22-year-old underwent the operation on the NHS in May in a bid to emulate his hero Joey Essex and become the 'perfect man'.

An NHS spokesman said: 'The NHS does not routinely fund SDR for the condition because, although it is a promising treatment, current evidence on its effectiveness in such cases is limited.

'SDR surgery shows real promise for some patients with mobility problems and that’s why we want to explore it further through our innovative evaluation programme.'

Ms Harington has raised £500 since launching her campaign a month ago and has several fundraising plans lined up to try and reach her £25,000 target.

She said: 'It is going really well so far. We have about £500 at the moment.

'Hayden’s dad Matt and a couple of his mates are cycling to Cardiff. It should be about 125 miles. We'll keep fundraising from there.'

Josie Cunningham from Leeds, had a boob job on the NHS to boost her confidence

The number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £52.5million.

Many
 of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment, but the 
increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses.

In one case, Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life.

The
 former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it 
emerged she had a £4,800 state-funded boob job at the same NHS Trust 
that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two-year-old to 
walk.

She later claimed her
 breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were 'so big' she 
found them embarrassing, and called on the NHS to pay for a reduction.

And
 barman Sam Barton, 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was 
given a nose job by the NHS – and boasted how easy it was to get the 
£5,000 procedure.

He now 
says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery, 
including another nose job, as well as having his ears pinned back and 
jaw reshaped.

The obesity 
epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill, with the number of 
liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in 
ten years.

The cost in the 
most recent year will have been up to £9.6million, according to NHS 
Choices which says the operation costs between £1,500 and £5,000.

There
 has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid 
surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £19.9million. This operation is 
supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision.

And 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £34.1million.

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘It’s ludicrous the NHS pays for procedures that are not
 based on strict medical needs.’

The figures were compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, following a request from the Daily Mail.

It also showed that up to 
£20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations, £5.8million on 
tummy tucks and £5.7million on ear pinning. However, these totals have 
declined over the past decade.

Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told a Westminster lunch: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.’

Roger
 Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘There are two types of 
cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort 
where someone is just trying to look better.

'We
 agree with the Secretary of State that this kind of thing is no longer 
affordable on the NHS. In fact, it is amazing it was ever considered 
affordable at all.’
