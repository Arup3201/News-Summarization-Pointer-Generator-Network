It was almost seven o'clock in the evening by the time Jose Mourinho arrived at Parc de Princes, but his reputation, as usual, had preceded him by several hours.

'I know Jose Mourinho and he will raise the temperature of this match,' said Laurent Blanc, earlier in the day, an unexpected reply to a question about the temperament of Marco Verratti, the 22-year-old Italian midfielder.

'Even when it is hot out there on the turf, they must stay calm and cold. We can't afford any more yellow cards.'

Blanc is keen to bill his team as outsiders, especially since his injury concerns deepened against Caen on Saturday, as Chelsea enjoyed the weekend without a game, as they were out of the FA Cup.

The Paris Saint-Germain manager had even gone as far as to hint they were happy to have lost against Bradford.

He was in classic Mourinho territory, bemoaning weariness and how the other lot had it much easier, but the Chelsea boss switched his angle and claimed Diego Costa would be lacking match sharpness.

It was hard to find the mirrors in the smoke. Mourinho declined to answer Blanc directly but teased about some of his pet subjects. Such as, how it is easier to plan a European campaign if your domestic competition is a procession.

'The last two English teams to win the Champions League, Chelsea and Liverpool finished fifth, 25 points behind the champions,' said Mourinho, although Chelsea actually finished sixth. 'They stopped playing for the title because a team that is playing in this country to win every game, to try to be champions, has a completely different profile.

'In Germany, for Bayern it's a promenade. In Spain they are waiting for Real Madrid against Barcelona and Barca against Real to decide which one is the champion. Atletico was an exception. In France, Paris knows they are going to be champions even losing or drawing a few matches.

'The last person to speak to about accumulation of matches and fatigue is a manager from an English club, because England is a special place. When the French players were on holidays at Christmas, we were playing five matches in 10 days.'

There was also a reminder, at a time when Blanc's future is uncertain, that he rejected the chance to take control at PSG and has seen the masterplan. 'I know the PSG project well because when they started, I was to be the coach,' said Mourinho. 'I met them in Qatar. The project was to start dominating in France, to dominate in Europe. Paris is a big team with big ambitions.'

The slogan inside PSG's famous stadium is: 'Dream Bigger', and yet the mood is that they have taken a step back while Chelsea have progressed since the teams met last year.

Mourinho has added Costa, the striker he felt he lacked when he played Andre Schurrle up front in Paris and lost 3-1.

Nemanja Matic was not available in  Europe last season, and there is Cesc Fabregas who has missed the last three games, but for 20 minutes against Everton, last week and is fighting illness to be fit today.

Then there is Eden Hazard, fresh from committing his long-term future to Chelsea by signing a contract until 2020.

Last year, PSG tried to lure him across the Channel and Mourinho was not impressed when the Belgian appeared wearing a PSG shirt in a post-match interview with canal+.

After signing last week, Hazard said he was never going to leave. 'He was always a good kid,' said Mourinho.

'When a talent like him doesn't sign a contract it's normal to have speculation but nobody signs a five year contract without being convinced of his happiness.'

In contrast, PSG have their injury crisis, discontent on the terraces and Blanc is taking criticism personally.

'I'll take the responsibility for the negativity around the Caen game (a 2-2 draw),' said Blanc. 'It was a catastrophe but, I'm responsible.'

He is accused of rushing Yohan Cabaye back from injury too soon, prompting the recurrence of a groin strain in a game PSG finished with nine men, due to injuries.

Cabaye, Serge Aurier and Lucas Moura have been ruled out and, although only Moura may have started, there was a depressed air which even the presence of David Luiz, with his sunny disposition and bright orange hoodie could not lift.

Asked to compare the two managers, Luiz quipped: 'They're both ugly.' Luiz flashed a grin but Blanc did not react. 'They do not understand me,' shrugged the oft-misunderstood Brazilian.
