Stuart Delaney  tried to disguise himself with a hoodie while raiding a bookmakers - only to reveal his face to the CCTV camera

A bungling robber was caught after trying to disguise himself with a hoodie while raiding a bookmakers - only to reveal his face to the CCTV camera.

Stuart Delaney, 29, also hurled a brick at the security screen in front of the cashier's desk at Ladbrokes in Stechford, Birmingham - only for it to bounce off.

The criminal then tried to steal a charity box from behind the counter of the branch - but left it because it was too big to fit under the metal tray.

Even his own defence lawyer said that the raid was a 'total failure', describing the would-be thief as 'clumsy' and 'bizarre'. 

Just hours before raiding the bookies on June 22, he had broken into a house nearby and stolen £2,000 worth of valuables.

Delaney has been jailed for three years and eight months after he admitted burglary and attempted robbery at Birmingham Crown Court.

The court heard the 'bizarre' raid took place while other gamblers carried on playing the fruit machines.

His face can clearly be seen on the security camera footage - even though he tried to hide his identity with a hooded top. 

Prosecutor Fiona Contese said: 'The cashier did not say anything and the defendant then approached the door that led to the staff side of the counter and threw a brick which bounced off.'

Delaney, of Sheldon, Birmingham. threw the brick again, forcing the cashier to duck, before he tried to grab the charity box.

Earlier the thief had ransacked a property and vandalised the outside with spray paint.

He was caught after he left fingerprints on the paint he used and left near the house.

The former kitchen assembler handed himself in shortly after the botched bookmakers raid.

John Smitheman, defending, said Delaney had begun drinking heavily after he split with his girlfriend and lost his job shortly before his bungled raid.

The 29-year-old, who has been jailed for three years and eight months, also hurled a brick at the security screen in front of the cashier's desk at Ladbrokes in Stechford, Birmingham (picture) - only for it to bounce off

He said: 'The problems all snowballed and led to this strange and bizarre behaviour.

'People in the bookmakers were still carrying on playing fruit machines and did not notice.

'It happened over a short period.

'There was a total failure in a clumsy manner.'
