Four entertainers could face the sack after photos emerged of them re-enacting a Jihadi execution at a children's summer camp in France.

The leaders at the retreat on the island of Groix, off southern Brittany, took 18 pictures while acting out executions similar to those carried out by the Islamic State terror group.

It is unclear whether any of the children at the camp - suitable for those aged between eight and 12 - watched the incident.

In one image shows one of the men kneeling on the floor, holding a newspaper, with his head covered. 

One of the four men is holding what looks to be a knife to his neck while another holds what appears to be a gun to his head.

In another image, a child is reportedly shown watching the gruesome charade. 

The children's camp is owned by the northwestern Paris commune of Colombes.

Mayor Nicole Goueta found the images on a USB stick while preparing a presentation on summer holidays run by her region.

Goueta has made an official complaint to police with regard to the images and the four leaders have been suspended from duty with further disciplinary proceedings expected.

'We were preparing an exhibition with pictures of summer camp vacations organised by the city in August on the island of Groix,'  Goueta told Le Parisien.

'They gave us a USB key with these pictures in which they simulate acts of torture and barbarism. There are 18. 

'On one of them, we see a child in the corner, sitting on the ground, with a terrified look. But we only see the foot of a facilitator.' 

Goueta confirms the photos were taken during a camp that was held from August 4 to 21 for 45 children.

'I hope that the children were absent at the time of the photos,' she said. 'But its leaders, educators ... it is to them that Colombians entrust their children. This is an unacceptable attitude.'

One of the men is said to have been the 33-year-old deputy director of the camp while the other three were temporary employees aged 22 and 23. 

'The mere existence of these photos requires me to act decisively,' Goueta said. 

'Given the international context, it will return to the police and justice whether these managers are open to the theories of radical Islam.'
