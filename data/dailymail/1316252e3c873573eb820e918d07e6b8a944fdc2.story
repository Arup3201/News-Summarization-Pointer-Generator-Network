Cambridge educated Luke Haggerty has been given a suspended sentence after drunkenly threatening another student with a knife in a row over a girl

A Cambridge educated City intern has appeared in court after drunkenly threatening another student with a knife in a row over a girl.

Luke Haggerty had been ‘stupidly drunk’ as he celebrated on the night of his graduation in June and made unwanted advances to another student’s girlfriend.

The other student rebuffed him and Haggerty staggered into the street where police spotted him and escorted him home.

But while at home he grabbed a kitchen knife and returned to the Balare nightclub in Cambridge where he confronted the other student who ran away.

Haggerty, 22, was too drunk to give chase and was arrested by police who charged him with possession of an offensive weapon.

The court heard he had stocked shelves to fund his dream of studying at Cambridge after gaining straight A-grades at his grammar school.

He wept in the dock at Cambridge Crown Court as he admitted the offence and was given a suspended sentence by Recorder John Foy QC.

Haggerty became so distressed he began to hyperventilate and was allowed to sit down by the judge.

Caroline Allison, mitigating, said Haggerty had attended a state-funded grammar school in Yorkshire and achieved his dream of going to Cambridge.

He graduated in Economics from Trinity College and narrowly missed a first-class degree.

She said: 'This is not what some of the public might think of as a posh lad who has had every opportunity and thrown it away with no thought at all.'

She said Haggerty was devastated by the 'stigma, upset and shame' his behaviour had brought on his family and on the university.

She added that Haggerty was now earning £800 a week in the City as an intern for a banking firm.

He was also handed a 12-month supervision and ordered to pay £480 costs.
