A hotel boss ordered his staff to write bogus reviews of his hotel after it had a series of bad reviews online.

Frank Long, who runs the Ramada Glasgow Airport Hotel, emailed his staff asking them to post glowing reviews of the hotel on TripAdvisor to boost its ratings.

He wrote to his team: 'We could do with some positive comments'.

Airport Hotel, pictured, emailed his staff asking them to go online and post 
glowing reviews of the hotel on TripAdvisor

He even asked his staff not to 'go overboard' so that the reviews appeared real.

Mr Long then apparently vowed to 'deny everything' if details of the scam emerged.

Soon reviews appeared on the travel review website, including one claiming it was the 'friendliest airport hotel ever' and made special reference to the quality of the staff.

In his email, Mr Long advised his staff on how not to get caught by using a different email address.

Genuine? This review said 'it's the staff who make it' and said it was the 'friendliest airport hotel anywhere'

According to the Daily Record he 
wrote: 'Do not overkill. Just good positive feedback such as: ‘Friendly 
staff/good food/comfortable rooms etc’.

'Headings like brilliant/great/very nice always read well. It must not be seen we are adding comments ourselves.'

One
 staff member told the paper that Mr Long had been 'harassing people to 
do reviews for ages' and said it was 'stupid' to have sent the email to 
staff members.

Mr Long 
tried to deny sending the email claiming there 'wasn't a signature' on 
it but then refused to make a comment when shown a copy of the message 
by a reporter.

Positive? The Ramada hotel has 189 reviews online and more than half of them are excellent or good

The hotel has 189 reviews on TripAdvisor and more than half of the reviews rate it excellent and 18 have branded it terrible. In total it has three-and-a-half stars out of five.

One review reads: 'This is now my hotel of choice when stating in Glasgow! Staff amazing. Proud and helpful. It's the small things that count and they have it nailed! Long may it continue! Rooms modern, clean and great great great laid out bathrooms!'

Underneath, Mr Long has written: 'It is always nice to receive such comments'.

Another review, entitled 'friendliest airport hotel anywhere', read: 'It's the staff who make it so: they turn an ordinary, run of the mill hotel into a pleasure, especially the bar and restaurant guys; anxious to please, jolly, motivated, and keen to make you feel at home.'

Mr Long wrote: 'I was delighted to read that you found the food & beverage department to be excellent and I will of course ensure they are all aware of your comments.'

Mr Long could not be reached when MailOnline contacted the hotel.

However, a spokesman for Kew Green Hotels, which manages the hotel, said: 'Kew Green Hotels manages 23 hotels across the UK and take all guest feedback very seriously including online reviews on websites including TripAdvisor. 

'A member of the management team at one of the hotels that we manage has been accused of manipulating the reviews.

'We do not condone this and it is against our company policy to write or encourage others to write manufactured reviews.  We have initiated an investigation and will take any action that may be appropriate once it is completed.'

A spokesman for TripAdvisor said: 'Our specialist Content Integrity team is investigating this issue as a matter of urgency, and if the hotel has been attempting to manipulate the TripAdvisor system they will be penalised accordingly.

'We take our responsibility as the world’s largest travel site extremely seriously, and employ a zero tolerance policy on fraudulent reviews.

'In addition to being a violation of our terms of service and an unethical practice, review fraud is also a violation of the law in many countries including the United Kingdom.'
