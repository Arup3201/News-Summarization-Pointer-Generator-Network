A student accused of helping a 17 year-old boy leave Britain to join terrorists in Syria is to stand trial at the Old Bailey next June.

Forhad Rahman, 20, allegedly assisted Aseel Muthana to get a replacement passport and bus tickets from Cardiff to the airport.

Muthana, from Cardiff, left Britain in February, but in the following month, Rahman was caught with two lists of equipment, entitled ‘Remember me’ and ‘Need’, to take to Syria, it is alleged.

Rahman today appeared at the Old Bailey (pictured) where he was told he will stand trial next year

The documents apparently contained items like binoculars and multi-tools, which were discovered when he was stopped at an airport on his return from Saudi Arabia.

Rahman appeared at the Old Bailey today charged with engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorists acts and two counts of possessing a record of information likely to be useful to terrorists.

He appeared from HMP Lewes wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit, and spoke only to confirm his identity.

Prosecutor Louise Gray said the Crown was considering applying to join the case with that of Kirsten Brekke, 19, a fellow terror suspect from Grangetown, Cardiff, who is also accused of assisting Aseel Muthana. 

Miss Gray added that ‘police officers from around the country have assisted in this case’.

After the brief hearing Mr Justice Sweeney remanded Rahman in custody, telling him: ‘You have heard that I have fixed your trial for 1 June.

‘That trial may be you alone or it may be you and Mr Brekke, depending on the prosecution making or not making an application to join the two of you together and whether that application succeeds.

‘In the meanwhile, you will be remanded in custody and your plea and case management hearing will take place on 10 April before the trial at this court.’

Rahman, of Chesterton, Gloucestershire, will enter pleas at the Old Bailey on 10 April next year.

A trial is provisionally fixed for 1 June, also at the Old Bailey, and is likely to last two weeks. If Rahman’s case is joined with that of Brekke, the trial will last three weeks.

Brekke, who also known as Kaleem, allegedly assisted Aseel Muthana to get a replacement passport and bus tickets from Cardiff to the airport.

If the two cases are not joined, Brekke will face a trial alone at the same court on 22 June.

Brekke, of Grangetown, Cardiff, is yet to enter a plea to a single charge of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorists acts.
