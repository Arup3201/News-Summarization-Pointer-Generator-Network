Two Ohio high-school football players
 accused of raping a teenage girl may not get a fair trial after a photo
 and video allegedly associated with the case were posted on the 
Internet by the computer hacking group Anonymous, a lawyer for one of 
the accused said on Friday.

Ma'lik Richmond and Trenton Mays, 
both 16 and members of the Steubenville High School football team, are 
charged with raping a 16-year-old fellow student last August, according 
to statements from their attorneys to local and national media.

Their juvenile court trial is scheduled for February in Steubenville, a city of 19,000 about 40 miles west of Pittsburgh.

Taking action: The so-called 'hacktivist' group Anonymous made a video announcing their plan to 'out' people involved in the alleged coverup of the incident

The case shot to national prominence 
this week when Anonymous activists made public a picture allegedly of 
the rape victim, being carried by her wrists and ankles by two young 
men, and of a video that showed several other young men joking about an 
alleged assault.

Horrific: Attendees at the various parties posted pictures of the two suspects dragging the seemingly unconscious victim around because she was too drunk to move

Richmond's lawyer, Walter Madison, 
said on CNN that his client was one of the young men in the photograph, 
but does not appear in the video.

But the picture 'is out of context,' Madison said. 'That young lady is not unconscious,' as has been widely reported.

'A right to a fair trial for these 
young men has been hijacked,' Madison said, adding that social media 
episodes such as this have become a major threat to a criminal 
defendant's right to a fair trial.

'It's very, very serious and fairness is essential to getting the right decision here,' he said.

Mays' attorney Adam Nemann could not 
immediately be reached for comment on Friday. In an interview on 
Thursday with Columbus, Ohio, broadcaster WBNS-10TV, Nemann raised 
concerns about the effect the Anonymous postings could have on potential
 witnesses in the case.

'This media has become so 
astronomically ingrained on the Internet and within that society, I am 
concerned witnesses might not want to come forward at this point. I 
would be surprised now, if there weren't witnesses now who might want to
 start taking the Fifth Amendment,' Nemann told the station.

Laughing boy: The 'star' of the video is Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student who can't contain his laughter as he describes the 'dead' victim, seemingly in another room of the house

Offensive: A number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online, including this one on Twitter; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence

The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution offers protection against self-incrimination in criminal proceedings.

The case has also been a challenge 
for local officials because of conflicts of interest. Both the local 
prosecutor and police have close ties to the school that the defendants 
attend.

As a result, the case is being investigated and prosecuted by Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's office.

Interviewed on CNN on Friday, DeWine 
said it was not unusual for his office to prosecute or investigate cases
 in small towns where close ties within the community caused conflicts 
of interest to arise.

Fan frenzy: The Big Red plays their home games at a 10,000 seat stadium, where they are broadcast on local television

Allegation: Both of the boys facing charges are students at Steubenville High School and were on the school's prestigious football team

He also voiced concern about how social media may affect the case.

'This case needs to be tried not in the media, not in social media,' DeWine said.

He said Anonymous' attempt to shame the alleged attackers had actually harmed the victim.

Not only is the victim hurt by the 
initial crime, but 'every time something goes up on the Internet, the 
victim is victimized again,' DeWine said.
