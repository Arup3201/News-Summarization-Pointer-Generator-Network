A Florida woman sentenced to 20 years in prison after firing a warning shot during an argument with her abusive husband has been released on bond while she awaits retrial under a controversial part of the state's self-defense law.

Marissa Alexander was convicted of aggravated-assault with a deadly weapon, which caused a furor when her supporters compared it to the self-defense case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted earlier this year of murdering an unarmed black teenager.

The case drew criticism from civil 
rights groups concerned about self-defense laws and mandatory minimum 
sentencing rules, but it received little attention outside north Florida
 until the Zimmerman case.

New trial: Marissa Alexander at her bond hearing Nov. 13, 2013, in Jacksonville, Florida. Alexander is getting a new trial after a court overturned her 20-year prison sentence for firing what she called a warning shot at her husband

Free for now: Although no one was injured in Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence under the state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines. Critics cried racism and their case was strengthened after George Zimmerman was found not guilty

Although no one was injured in 
Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence under the
 state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines because she had fired a
 gun during the assault.

A state appeals court ruled in September that Alexander, who is black, deserved a new trial because the judge failed to properly instruct the Jacksonville, Florida jury about her self-defense argument. She was convicted in May 2012.

'This news is vindication for Marissa and all the women who have become criminalized for exercising their basic right to defend themselves and their children,' Angie Nixon of Florida New Majority, a social justice organization, said of Alexander's release.

Zimmerman was arrested for killing Trayvon Martin in 2012 and was acquitted of murder and manslaughter in July 2013.

Under the so-called Stand Your Ground clause which was added to Florida's self-defense law in 2005, people who use deadly force to defend themselves from serious injury - rather than retreating to avoid confrontation - can be immune from prosecution.

Zimmerman never sought immunity under Stand Your Ground, instead relying on a standard self-defense law.

Alexander, who had never been arrested before, has said she fired a bullet to scare off her husband when she felt he was threatening her.

No one was hurt, but the judge in the case said he was bound by state law to sentence her to 20 years in prison after she was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Racism? The case drew criticism from civil rights groups concerned about self-defense laws and mandatory minimum sentencing rules, but it received little attention outside north Florida until the Zimmerman case

Alexander's Stand Your Ground claim was 
rejected because she left the house during the confrontation to retrieve
 a gun from her car, returning to fire a shot near her husband Rico 
Gray's head.

A slightly built woman who stands 5 feet 2 inches, Alexander said her 245-pound husband was about to attack her when she fired into a kitchen wall during the August 2010 incident. He had previously been convicted of domestic violence for attacking her.

Prosecutors said the shot endangered Gray. At the time, Alexander had an active restraining order against her husband and she carried a concealed weapons permit.

State Attorney Angela Corey, who oversaw the prosecution of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, has stood by the handling of Alexander's case. Corey said she believes that Alexander aimed the gun at the man and his two sons, and that the bullet she fired could have ricocheted and hit any of them.
