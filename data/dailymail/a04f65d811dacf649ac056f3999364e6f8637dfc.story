A British man has become the second patient in a Europe to have pioneering stem cell treatment in a bid to prolong his life.

Jesse Freeman, 71, was invited to take part in the landmark trial after suffering a major heart attack at home.

Cardiologists repaired a blocked artery and inserted a stent to keep it open after he was rushed to hospital.

Jesse Freeman (pictured with his wife, Christine) has become the second person in Europe to have pioneering stem cell treatment after a heart attack. It is hoped the procedure will cause his damaged heart muscle to regenerate and that it could eventually become common practice in the treatment of heart attack patients

But while recovering in hospital, he was asked to take part in the major new study to see if heart attack patients can benefit from being treated with their own stem cells.

These are 'master cells' which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body, replacing damaged cells.

Doctors at the London Chest Hospital, in Bethnal Green, removed bone marrow from Mr Freeman, a grandfather, without general anaesthetic and the cells were then infused into his heart.

Mr Freeman, a chauffeur, had bone marrow  extracted from his hip before it was 'purified' in a stem cell laboratory.

This allowed the stem cells to be separated from the serum also found in bone marrow.

He then had the stem cells injected into his major coronary arteries from where they infused into his heart muscle.

It is hoped this will help his damaged heart muscle regenerate.

Mr Freeman was treated at The London Chest Hospital (pictured) and will continue to receive check-ups for five years as doctors study the effect of the stem cell treatment

He will now continue to have check-ups for five years in a bid to see how the treatment affects the health of his heart.

He told MailOnline: 'When I heard about the trial I thought it was a good idea. It was explained to me and I could see where they were coming from, so I hoped some good would come of it. At least they've tried.

'I thought: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.'

He added: 'I feel fantastic in 
myself. Most people wouldn't believe I've had a heart attack. I think 
I've been very lucky and I hope the procedure does what they are 
hoping it will do.'

Within a few days of receiving the stem cells, Mr Freeman had recovered from the procedure and was able to leave hospital.

Mr Freeman had some of his own bone marrow harvested from his hip.

The stem cells were then removed from the bone marrow in a specialist lab.

The stem cells were then injected into his coronary arteries from where they infused into his heart muscle.

It is hoped this will cause the damaged heart muscle to regenerate.

Stem cells are the body’s master cells which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body, replacing damaged cells.

Using the patient's own stem cells means the chance of them being rejected is much lower.

Mr Freeman will have check-ups for five years and his progress will be compared to that of other heart attack patients.

If the procedure prove to be successful, it could become standard practice in the treatment of heart attack patients.

Mr Freeman's progress will now be monitored and compared with that of other heart attack victims who have not had the treatment.

Medical experts hope that, by using his own stem cells, the risk of rejection is greatly reduced and it will speed his recovery.

It is hoped the treatment will increase survival rates among heart patients by at least 25 per cent if carried out within five days of a heart attack.

The 5.9 million euro trial is taking place in Britain and nine other European countries and is funded by the European Commission.

Mr Freeman, from Romford, Essex, said he had been told by doctors that he was a perfect candidate for the research as only 45 per cent of his heart was working.

Mr Freeman, who is married to Christine, 67, said: ‘My hope is that the cells will regenerate and give me ability and a normal life cycle.

‘I feel damn lucky - the stem cell surgery could not have happened at a better time.

‘I am grateful to be part of a pioneering programme.’

He added: 'I think this is the way of the future - I am happy to be in on it.

The trial is being carried out by Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the London Chest Hospital, in conjunction with Queen Mary, University of London and University College London.

Altogether 3,000 patients across Europe will be taking part in the pilot scheme.

Consultant cardiologist Professor Anthony Mathur said: ‘The study is the biggest and most comprehensive trial of its kind in the world and follows successful trials, funded by The Heart Cells Foundation.

Mr Freeman told MailOnline that he was very happy to take part in the trial in the hope it will help future patients. He said it was 'no skin off my nose' but that it could lead to real benefits

‘It has taken two years to get to the point where we are ready to accept patients, but we have now reached that stage and we are all very excited.

‘Our studies will tell us if adult stem cells from bone marrow can repair damaged hearts and, if so, how these cells should be administered to patients.

‘Stem cells are the body’s master cells which can turn into almost any other type of cell in the body, replacing damaged cells.

'This study will determine if adult stem cells can save lives in heart attack patients across Europe.'

Professor John Martin, from University College London, added: 'This trial brings together a powerful partnership of European doctors and scientists to solve a fundamental problem of importance to all people. 

'It will give an answer about whether adult multi-potential stem cells in their natural environment can treat human disease.'
