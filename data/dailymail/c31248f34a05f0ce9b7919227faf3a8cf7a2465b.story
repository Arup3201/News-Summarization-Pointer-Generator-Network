Syrian rebels have surrendered the city of Homs to forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad, bringing a three-year siege of the city by government troops to an end.

According to Homs Gov. Talal Baraz, more than 1,500 troops have left the city since Wednesday, giving up their positions in the Old Homs district. The city will be declared 'secure' when government troops move in later today.

However, in a show of defiance, rebel forces in Aleppo blew up a hotel being used as a base by government troops after digging tunnels underneath and packing them with explosives.

The governor of Homs said that around 1,500 fighters had left the city, which will be declared 'secure' after government troops move in later today

The amnesty, which saw fighters bussed out of the city, was brokered by Iran and enforced by the UN

As part of an amnesty deal in Homs, rebel 
fighters were taken on green buses out of the city once dubbed the 
'capital of the revolution' after militias seized large parts of it 
during the 'Arab spring' in 2011.

This afternoon a banner on Syrian TV said the last of the rebels left
 the city, proclaiming, 'Old Homs is totally clean of armed terrorist 
groups' - the term used by the government for the rebels.

As Al-Assad's troops entered the city the extent of destruction caused by two years of continuous fighting was laid bare, with whole neighbourhoods reduced to rubble and building reduced to concrete skeletons.

The city was once home to nearly a million people, according to a 2002 census, but its central districts are now virtual ghost towns, littered with twisted metal an broken concrete.

While re-taking Homs marks a major victory for Al-Assad, elsewhere in Syria today rebel fighters reduced the once-luxurious Carlton Hotel in Aleppo to dust after digging tunnels underneath it and packing them with explosives.

The hotel was being used as a base by government troops at the time, though it was not immediately clear how many died in the attack.

While there are still rebel soldiers in some of the outskirts of the city, the centre of Homs is now deserted

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which maintains a
 network of activists on the ground, said at least 14 soldiers were 
killed in the blast. Islamic Front, the rebel alliance 
which claimed responsibility for the attack, claimed to have killed 50 soldiers.

The blast set off a gigantic mushroom cloud next to the historic citadel of Aleppo, collapsing the Carlton Hotel in a government-held area near the front lines in the city, which has been one of the bloodiest and destructive battlegrounds of Syria's civil war.

While it is not thought the attack was directly linked to the withdrawal from Homs, it is a powerful display by the rebels, showing they can still inflict heavy damage on Al-Assad's forces.

In a live broadcast from the site of blast, Syrian state TV's correspondent in Aleppo stood on a pile of rubble, saying that the army had been using the building as a base and soldiers were positioned there at the time of the explosion. 

The report did not mention casualties as the Syrian government does not reveal the numbers of soldiers killed in the civil war.

The correspondent said: 'They [rebels] use tunnels like rats because they cannot face the Syrian Arab Army.'

As government forces entered the city, the destruction wrought by three years of conflict became clear with burned out buildings puckered with shell shrapnel

It is not the first time rebels are believed to have used the technique to attack the Carlton. In February part of the building collapsed after fighters allegedly dug underneath the hotel an filled them with explosives.

The Front, an alliance of several Islamic groups fighting to topple Assad, has also used the technique to carry out deadly attacks against government forces in Aleppo and Idlib provinces.

The city of Aleppo has been carved up into opposition- and government-held areas since the rebels launched an offensive there in mid-2012, capturing territory along Syria's northern border with Turkey.

In recent months, government aircraft 
have continuously bombed rebel-held areas of the city and the opposition
 fighters have hit back, firing mortars into government-held areas. The 
rebels also have detonated car bombs in residential areas, killing 
dozens of people.

While an amnesty deal is in effect in Homs, elsewhere in Aleppo today rebel forces leveled a hotel being used as a government base after tunneling underneath it and planting explosives

The explosion was described as being 'like an earthquake' by a TV correspondent. It was not immediately clear how many soldiers were killed, and estimates range from 15 to 50

The Islamic Front posted a statement on its official Twitter account Thursday saying that its 'fighters this morning leveled the Carlton Hotel barracks in Old Aleppo and a number of buildings near it, killing 50 soldiers.'

Syria's uprising began with largely peaceful protests and has evolved into a civil war with sectarian overtones, pitting largely Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government that is dominated by Alawites, a sect of Shiite Islam. 

Islamic extremists, including foreign fighters and Syrian rebels who have taken up hard-line al-Qaida-style ideologies, have played an increasingly prominent role among fighters, dampening the West's support for the rebellion to overthrow Assad.
