Nigel Farage faced criticism tonight after demanding to be allowed to join other party leaders at the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph this weekend.

The Ukip leader claimed millions of Ukip voters had been snubbed while leaders of smaller parties were allowed to attend.

But a senior government source told MailOnline Mr Farage was wrong to make the sombre wreath laying ceremony 'all about him'.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage hit out at the 'closed shop' of British politics which meant Ukip would not be represented at the Cenotaph ceremony

David Cameron will lead other politicians including Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Alex Salmond in laying wreaths after the Queen during Sunday's service.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport today insisted said the long-standing position was to invite a representative from parties with six or more MPs.

Ukip only has a single member in the Commons, Clacton MP Douglas Carswell.

However it won the European Parliament elections in May, and Ukip is targetting 100 seats in next year's general election.

Mr Farage complained that the 'closed shop' of the British political system prevented him from attending the event.

He said: 'I think it's actually quite a snub to all the millions of people that have voted Ukip.'

Speaking on his LBC phone-in, Mr Farage said: 'We're not invited and I could say to you that personally I would like to be because this is a subject that I care very deeply about.

'But what I think is, the whole point about political representation at the Cenotaph is it's not the politician that matters, it's the voters behind the politician that matter.

'And in the last national election Ukip got 4.4 million votes and none of those people are being represented on Sunday despite the fact there are political parties with far smaller votes than that being represented.'

He added: 'Whether it's me or somebody else doesn't really matter. But I do think that we won the last election we should have had some representation on Sunday. And I think it's actually quite a snub to all the millions of people that have voted Ukip.'

Mr Farage said it was for the Government to invite him 'but I'm afraid with this as with everything else, British politics operates like a closed shop and they don't' want anyone new to get involved'.

'Well they're in for a terrible shock and I'll tell you something, Ukip will be there next year.'

But a senior government source said: 'How dare Nigel Farage make the day of remembrance and the laying of wreaths all about him? It tells you all you need to know about him.'

The Ukip leader also expressed surprise that eBay had halted auctions for the Tower of London poppies - and admitted he wanted to use the website to buy one himself.

Mr Farage also called for the Tower of London poppies to be allowed to stay for longer to give more people chance to see them

All the 888,246 ceramic flowers used in the Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red installation have sold for £25 each through Historic Royal Palaces, which runs the Tower, with the proceeds going to service charities.

The internet auction site has cancelled any listings for the items following reports that one user had listed two of the poppies for sale, one at GBP49.99 and the other for GBP65.

An eBay spokesman said: 'We are not permitting resale of the limited edition Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red ceramic poppies on eBay.'

But Mr Farage said: 'I was very surprised to hear that eBay had done that, because whatever you think, you may say it's insensitive, but hang on - when people bought these poppies there was no commercial contract that said they couldn't sell them on.

'So I'm rather surprised by this. I have a slight confession, I didn't get in in time to buy any, nearly everyone I work with has got some, but I said to the children 'don't worry, we'll buy them on eBay in a few weeks time'.'
