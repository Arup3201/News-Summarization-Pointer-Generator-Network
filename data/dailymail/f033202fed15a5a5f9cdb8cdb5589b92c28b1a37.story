A British soldier who has joined a Kurdish military unit fighting Islamic State is in grave danger of being kidnapped and beheaded, experts have warned.

Concerns have been raised for the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment squaddie now thought to be fighting deadly jihadists on the frontline in Northern Syria.

The 19-year-old soldier – who once shared a barracks with murdered fusilier Lee Rigby – was based in Cyprus before his shock disappearance. 

Fears: The 19-year-old British soldier, right, who once shared a barracks with murdered fusilier Lee Rigby, left, is believed to have joined Kurdish forces in Syria

It’s believed he has joined a Kurdish unit called the YPG. 

Fears for his safety are based on postings on Facebook suggesting a member of the unit has defected to IS.

A post appeared on a Facebook page of YPG spokesman Zagros Cudi claiming that one of his comrades had joined IS and that it was now ‘forbidden’ for anyone to contact this individual.

A Western source inside the YPG said: ‘If the defector still has contacts in YPG, he could offer them a lot of money to give us up or the British soldier, who would carry the highest price. 

'Wherever he goes, there will be a huge price on his head.’

The source added: ‘The British soldier will be sent straight to the frontline in Rojava where there is fierce fighting against IS. 

'Unwittingly, perhaps, he has put himself in much more danger than he could have imagined.’

Kurdish expert Professor Gareth Stansfield said: ‘If captured he would be treated as a mercenary and face almost certain death. The publicity value would be enormous.’
