Roma coach Rudi Garcia has cast his side in the role of underdogs against Manchester City, saying that his team should already have been knocked out of the Champions League.

The Italian league runners-up need to beat the Premier League champions on Wednesday to reach the last 16 while a draw could be enough depending on the result of CSKA Moscow's match at Bayern Munich.

Using somewhat curious logic, Garcia suggested that, after being placed in pot four of the draw for the Champions League group stage, Roma had done more than expected.

'In theory, we should already be out of contention as they are the champions of England and we were in pot four and have landed in the most difficult group,' the Frenchman told reporters.

'This match will be special for me and the club, it will be like a final,' he added.

Roma have had contrasting fortunes at the Stadio Olimpico, beating CSKA Moscow 5-1 but slumping to an extraordinary 7-1 defeat by Bayern.

A win would take Roma through to the last 16 at the expense of Manchester City and CSKA Moscow

'We need to make the most of every moment....a win would be incredible,' Garcia said.

'We know that City are a good side. It will be very tough tomorrow but I'm sure we can do it. We can only decide our own fate with a win. We can't know what happens in the game between Bayern and CSKA.'
