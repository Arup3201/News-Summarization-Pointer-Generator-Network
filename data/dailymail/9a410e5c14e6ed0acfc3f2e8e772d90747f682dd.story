Former Chelsea defender Frank Leboeuf has warned Paris Saint Germain that new signing David Luiz is not a central defender because he forgets his responsibilities to rove forward.

Despite the Brazilian joining the Ligue 1 champions for a world record fee of 50 million euros (£39.9m) for a defender after having won the Champions League and Europa League in his favoured position, Leboeuf still thinks he would be better used in midfield.

Speaking to RMC, the World Cup winner said: 'He's a great player, but he's not a central defender because he forgets a huge amount of things. t's up to him to work and be focused.'

Hair raising! David Luiz has signed for Paris Saint Germain in a world record fee for a defender

Food for thought: Frank Leboeuf has warned former teammate Laurent Blanc that Luiz is not a defender

Leboeuf has urged the 27-year-old to learn from former teammate and PSG coach Laurent Blanc - whom he replaced in the 1998 World Cup final in France

'He is fortunate to have a coach who was a defender and who can help him. He's going to have to work because he only thinks about going forward and that creates gaps at the back.

'When he played in midfield with Chelsea, I thought he was very good. He gets through an extraordinary amount of work.

'I'm critical of him because when he plays at the back, he doesn't think like a central defender. He goes beyond his pay grade, because he only goes forward.'

Meanwhile, Angel Di Maria will not be joining Paris Saint-Germain from Real Madrid this summer because he is 'too expensive'. 

Forward thinking: David Luiz is too focussed on surging forward than defensive responsibilities

The French champions were expected to complete a deal in excess of £50million for the Argentine winger with Manchester United also interested.

But PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi revealed at a press conference on Thursday, where new signing Luiz was also unveiled, that Di Maria's fee was too much.

Al-Khelaifi said: 'We spoke with Real Madrid about the possibility of signing Angel Di Maria, but it was too expensive.'
