The brother of murder-accused Olympian Oscar Pistorius cried tears of relief as a magistrate acquitted him of culpable homicide in the death of a woman in a car accident.

The magistrate ruled today that Carl Pistorius was not negligent and that Maria Barnard was driving her motorcycle excessively fast when she crashed into the back of his vehicle in 2008.

The accident happened in Vanderbijlpark in South Africa's Gauteng province, an hour's drive south of Johannesburg in 2008.

The prosecution said it had failed to prove its case and would take no further action.

Pistorius' stepmother and sister hugged him in the court.

His father was also seen offering him support, although his famous brother was not seen.

Carl Pistorius was represented by the same lawyer as his brother, the highly-respected advocate Kenny Oldwage.

Mr Oldwage said Carl Pistorius and his defence team were delighted after the drawn-out court battle

'We are satisfied with the end of it all. We are delighted,' said Mr Oldwage.

'As for Carl, I can only say he is delighted,' he told IOL News.

The case attracted interest as it 
came to court shortly after double-amputee Olympics star Oscar Pistorius
shot dead his girlfriend on Valentine's Day.

Oscar Pistorius, 26, is charged with 
premeditated murder in the shooting he says was accidental because he 
mistook her for a burglar.

It comes as it was today reported 
detectives investigating Reeva's death have questioned a blonde 
socialite over her relationship with the Blade Runner amid claims the 
two shared flirty text messages and canoodled at a party.

Junior
PR executive Erin Stear, 25, gave a statement to police under oath in 
which she denied having an affair with Pistorius, according to The Sun.

A
source told the paper: 'Erin met Oscar when Reeva was his girlfriend. 
They hit it off and met up again after messaging each other. She was 
really excited about getting to know him.'

It comes days after Oscar Pistorius revealed he will not return to the track for the rest of the year so he can focus on his looming court case.

Pistorius
stands accused of premeditated murder after the death of his girlfriend
Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead on Valentine's Day at his Pretoria 
home.

The 'Blade Runner', 
who was released on bail in February, will be back in court on June 4 
and is likely to stand trial before the end of 2013.

But the Paralympian’s coach Ampie Louw
revealed Pistorius has turned down invitations to take part in major 
international athletic events and will stay away from the track.

the dock: Carl Pistorius was seen at his brother's bail hearing (behind left).  Pistorius denies murder, claiming he shot his model 
girlfriend, believing a burglar had entered their home while they slept.

Louw said: 'We have decided as a team we are not talking [about] any training or athletics.

'We have postponed [races] for the whole year.'

This week a final photo emerged of the couple snuggling tenderly on the sofa, sharing a laugh over their pet monkey.

'He was tickling her,' Pistorius' best friend Christo Menelaou, who took the picture, told South Africa's You magazine. 'They were lovers and also real friends.'

Christo, 34, who said Pistorius had grown a thick beard since his girlfriend's death, added: 'He cries a lot and says over and over, "I’m sorry".'
