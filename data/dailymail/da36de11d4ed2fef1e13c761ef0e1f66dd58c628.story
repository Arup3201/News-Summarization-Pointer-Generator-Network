Uber is to begin offering a package delivery service in New York, the firm has announced.

The controversial car firm which has come under fire for its 'surge' pricing policies, will offer deliveries by bike and foot for the first time, taking on existing services like Postmates.

It will charge at least $15 for each delivery, and the service will initially only work in a small part of Manhattan, the firm said.

The controversial car firm says its new courier option, UberRUSH, is like 'Uber for things'

'It's an Uber for things,' said Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber NYC.

The new service, called UberRUSH, uses a courier on foot or on bike to deliver packages.

'With UberRUSH, your packages travel like a VIP. You get fast messenger pickups and immediate deliveries of the things you need to send,' the firm said.

Messengers will only make deliveries within Manhattan below 110th Street to start.

'We’re working to expand quickly, and will update you as coverage areas change,' it said.

The new service will use the existing Uber app to allow customers to book.

Once a delivery is underway, both parties can track the courier via the app.

Uber has not said how many couriers are signed up, but is appealing for more on its site.

'We’re looking to partner with the best messengers in NYC,' it said.

The service will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the company plans to roll it out to other cities.

It will compete with other app delivery services such as Postmates, which began in San Francisco and has been operating across Manhattan and Brooklyn for several months.

Uber said its rates are calculated based on zone pricing. If a delivery begins and ends within the same zone, it¿s a flat $15. Each zone crossed during delivery is an additional $5, and additional stops may result in a higher fare.
