Guilty: Kirk Brown, who posed as a 'viscount', admitted defrauding members of his wife's family out of £266,000

A man posing as a 'viscount' today admitted defrauding his mother-in-law out of £150,000 while posing as a millionaire business magnate.

Kirk Brown changed his name by deed poll to Vizconde von Hoehen de Bessarabia, and claimed he was due a £400m inheritance, Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court was told.

Pretending to be the owner of a bogus shipping firm, the 46-year-old persuaded his wife's mother, Nicola Young, to invest £150,000 into the non-existent business.

The fantasist also convinced his wife's uncle, Richard Birch, to transfer a total of £116,000 into another imaginary venture involving a Bulgarian stockbroker.

Prosecutor Peter Nagle said: ‘In short, dealing with the facts...the victims were known to the defendant.

‘He [Brown] was married to Mr Birch’s niece and she is Mrs Young’s daughter. He claimed he was due a substantial inheritance of £400m.

‘He offered to invest the money in a new company to be set up between himself and Mr Birch. He asked for £50,000 in order to give Mr Birch preference shares in the company.

‘He also stated he was in control of a shipping container company based in the Seychelles and asked Mr Birch for £56,000 for buying new containers. They never arrived.

‘He also asked for a further £10,000, claiming to know a Bulgarian stock-broker "whizz kid".

‘When he was eventually arrested for these three allegations, at the time this is when Mrs Young came forward and in essence said the defendant asked for her to invest in the same shipping container business.

‘It is said he obtained approximately £150,000 from her.

‘The victims are known to him so there is an element of a breach of trust’, Mr Nagle added.

Chair of the magistrates, Trevor Grove, said: ‘This is a matter suitable only for the Crown Court for sentence.'

Brown
appeared calm in the dock, speaking only to confirm his birth name, 
contact details and to enter guilty pleas to all four charges.

He
displayed none of the trappings of wealth, wearing black jeans, a black
trench-coat and black trainers for the 15 minute hearing.

Brown, of Farnham, Surrey, pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud by false representation.

He was released on unconditional bail until November 5 when he will be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court.
