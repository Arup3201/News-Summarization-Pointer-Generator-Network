Gus Poyet admits he was hurt by Phil Bardsley’s defection to Stoke after saving his Sunderland career.

Bardsley fell out with previous Black Cats boss Paolo Di Canio after being pictured lying on the floor of a casino covered in £50 notes. He then mocked Sunderland’s defeat at home to Fulham last August with a post on Twitter and was suspended by the club.

But Poyet – who replaced Di Canio in October - offered Bardsley a lifeline and he went on to play a key role in Sunderland’s journey to the League Cup final and escape from relegation.

Gus Poyet resurrected Phil Bardsley's career but saw him leave for Stoke this summer

The 29-year-old returns to the Stadium of Light on Tuesday having joined the Potters on a free transfer after his deal on Wearside expired during the summer.

And ahead of the Capital One cup third-round tie, Poyet said: ‘If I said I was disappointed I would not be telling the whole truth because it hurts badly.

‘I am very sad because we helped each other a lot. He was training elsewhere and we brought him back and he reacted in an incredible way.

‘He helped us to get safe and we helped him to come back into football. And then things happened. In football these things happen.’

He went on: ‘The first two (Bardsley and Jack Colback, who joined Newcastle) that we decided to negotiate with, they didn’t work, because everybody was playing the waiting game.

Bardsley will line up for Stoke on Tuesday against the club he spent six years at between 2008 and 2014

‘That killed us a bit, for whatever reason. It was not like we were not agreeing, but it all depended on where we were the following season and maybe then it became too late.

‘Then players get an offer and sometimes it is difficult to equal as it is too much. That is a side of the game. It not about being greedy. Not at all.

‘The problem was timing. It was impossible.

‘You tell a player we cannot offer you a contract until we know we are in the Premier League or the Championship and they will say it all depends.

‘In the end that is what happened with Phil and it was difficult for him. It is tough for us. It hurt more than anything because he is not with me, but if he is happy and his family are happy then I’m alright because with it that is the most important thing. I hope we will see him on Tuesday.’

Poyet has revealed how upset he was that the defender left the Stadium of Light when his contract expired

Sunderland lost to Manchester City in last season’s final having beaten Chelsea and Manchester United en route to Wembley.

They are expected to name a strong side against Stoke – including a debut for Uruguay defender Sebastian Coates – and defender Patrick van Aanholt said: ‘The club reached the final last year so it will be an important game for us.

‘The cups are special and it is all about one game rather than playing every week like we do in the league, so hopefully we can do well and progress to the next round.’
