The killer of an Oregon woman whose body was found in a hotel stairwell Friday is still at large, and  homicide investigators are enlisting the help of the public to uncover the details of her murder.

On Friday morning, police were called to the DoubleTree hotel in Portland after the body of Ashley Benson, 24, was found in one of the hotel's stairwells, KATU reports.

By Saturday, the woman's death was ruled a homicide.

No details of Benson's death have been released, but investigators said in a news release Sunday that the mother-of-one was a victim of sex trafficking.

Authorities say it is unclear whether that is directly related to Benson's death.

Benson's mother told KATU that she went to the hotel looking for her daughter on Friday when she became worried after not being able to contact her. 

Benson was arrested in 2011 and charged with third-degree theft. 

Family members said they saw Benson on Christmas Day, 21 hours before she was found dead, KATU reports. Benson allegedly told her father that she was going to see a movie with friends Thursday.

She never returned home.

Autopsy: Portland homicide detectives are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Benson's murder and have not released the cause of her death, which an autopsy determined Saturday

Michelle Bart, with the National Women’s Coalition Against Violence and Exploitation, said that when one is a victim of sex trafficking, contact with family is rare.

She told KATU there is a difference between police labeling someone a prostitute and a victim of sex trafficking.

'A lot of the time in human trafficking cases, the victims are not able to live one place and they're not living apart from the criminal activity or their abusers,' she said.

Portland homicide detectives are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Benson's murder and have not released the cause of her death, which an autopsy determined Saturday.

Benson's family has set up a GoFundMe page in Benson's honor to raise donations to pay for the woman's funeral and to help care for her son.

Friend: A longtime friend of Benson's, Karissa Sheaffer (right), described Benson as a generous person with a contagious laugh

In a Facebook comment, a man named Michael, who is identified on Facebook as Benson's father, describes Benson's son as a 5-year-old named Marlan.

Michael wrote: 'My poor grandson is 5 and ready of his life when others celebrate Christmas (sic) Marlan will mourn his mother's death. I am thankful for a great Christmas Eve with her (sic) cause they will never be the same for me either now.'

Since, her death, many have posted and made statements about the woman and her tragic death. A longtime friend of Benson's, Karissa Sheaffer, told Oregon Live that Benson was a generous person with a contagious laugh.

Sheaffer said her heart aches for Benson's son who is left without a mother.

'She loved her son more than life itself and it always showed,' Sheaffer said.
