Wildlife photographer Alex Cearns has served in the police force for 14 years and visited some amazing locations but one of her most memorable moments is of when an emu sat on top of her during a photoshoot.

40-year-old Cearns, who has released her second book Joy which is filled with animal photos, is utterly obsessed with the furry creatures and photographs around 1300 animals per year. 

'I went to photograph an emu and she sat on top of me. She bumped me out of the way and I kind of fell on the ground and she came over and sat on top of me,' the western Australian woman told Daily Mail Australia.

When she was 16-years-old Cearns bought a film camera but didn't really have any idea how to use it. In 2006, she treated herself to a digital camera and soon realised her passion. 

She joined the Western Australian Police Service when she was 19 and left 14 years later to pursue her hobby of animal photography. Since then, she has opened up her own studio, Houndstooth Studio, and has won more than fifty Australian and international photographic awards. 

'I realised that I liked photographing animals the best,' she said.

'I would kind of gravitate towards birds and dogs if I was at the park other than people and landscapes. It’s where I'm really comfortable photographing I struggle with everything else.'

While she always thought her favourite animal would be something exotic, she reveals that she loves to photograph the humble dog. The domestic animal's unconditional love has inspired many of the photographers compelling snapshots in her book.

Max the smiling wombat came into Cearns' studio in a pouch. He was soon jumping around and smiling for the camera 

 

Cearns was part of the Western Australian Police Service for 14 years and soon realised her passion for photography 

A sleepy baby boxer puppy was photographed by Cearns in the studio at just eight weeks old. Puppies generally play until they crash and Cearns managed to capture this adorable photograph just before the puppy fell asleep

'They just give you so much unconditionally and are generally so happy to see you,' she said.

'I also love photographing baby native Australian animals because I just think we have some of the sweetest most adorable creatures here and I think they’re gorgeous.'

In Cearns' beautiful book, she details the joy animals provide to humans in the world. Each picture has it's own story and starts with an adorable baby Orangutan sucking his thumb. 

The precious animal was living in a colony in Singapore when Cearns visited for a photoshoot. The whole family were feeding at the time and eating mangosteen.

'I was a few metres away and it was a little bit dark so I couldn't actually see what I was capturing at the time. It wasn't until I got home and looked at the pictures three weeks later that I realised the baby had been sucking their thumb,' she said. 

Alex the pig became friends with Cearns after she arrived at the gate of Brightside Farm as a stray

On the opposite page lies a cheeky, smiling wombat from Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary in Tasmania. Cearns explains that Max the wombat was about the size of a football and full of joy.

He came into the studio session tucked up in a pouch. When the time came to photograph the furry animal, he was jumping around, headbutting Cearns and going crazy on the set. 

However he soon settled back down and went back to his pouch, happily smiling up at her like a tiny Buddha. 

Cearns tells of an injured grasshopper she photographed in an educational animal facility in Western Australia. The critter was wild and kept jumping on her face and all over her camera as she tried to get the best shot.   

'He was maybe three-and-a-half inches in length and I asked they can they bite?' she said.

Unfortunately for her, they can bite, and it was a close call for the photographer. 

A baby seal on Kangaroo Island caught Cearns' eye after coming over to her on the beach and nudging her. The seal's mother had gone off hunting and the seal was obviously checking to see if Cearns was her mother.  

'I felt like he was checking to see was I his mum and then went back and lay down again,' she said.

The story of Alex the pig definitely tugs at the heartstrings. The pig turned up one day at the gate of Brightside Farm Sanctuary in Tasmania. A few days later, Cearns visited and decided to tickle the pig on his stomach, not knowing that the pig was a stray and did not belong to the farm.

While her friend was disgusted she has touched the 'feral' animal, Cearns developed a strong bond with the pig. When she visited again in February this year, the pig didn't recognise her and Cearns left the barn upset. However, within an hour the pig has ran out in search of his friend, remembering their heart-warming moment together. 

'I was delighted, I was crying because I was so excited,' she said. 

Cearns decided to photograph three Balinese street puppies for a  campaign called 'Look Twice'. The campaign aimed to make people stop and look at the animals on the streets of Bali instead of turning a blind eye.  

'I wanted to do a studio shoot because I wanted to show people that dogs and cats on the street in Bali are really just the same as our pets at home,' she said.

'Don’t try and befriend them just give them an extra piece of toast or something.'
