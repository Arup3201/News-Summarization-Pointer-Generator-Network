The onesie phenomenon took over the fashion charts in 2012, and now couples can double up and snuggle up this Valentine’s Day as George at Asda launches the latest in casualwear innovation: ‘The Twosie.’

Comprising of 10 metres of fabric, four arms, two hoods and featuring a bunny inspired design, the 'twosie' - a fashion first as far as we are aware - means that the nation’s love bunnies can snuggle up together in comfort.

This year a staggering 92 per cent of couples are planning to shun the traditional candle-lit restaurant dinner on the 14th in favour of staying in and cuddling up in each others company, according to a survey by the supermarket brand.

One becomes two! George at Asda has developed the Twosie for couples who want to be ultra close (and cute)

Love bunnies: The twosie has a rabbit design-complete with ears- and has the words Love Bunnies across the back

The survey also found that two thirds of women claim that they would rather receive a simple 
or novelty gift than an expensive or elaborate present, to help battle 
financial stresses this year.

George at Asda created the twosie following unprecedented customer demand for a onesie made for two.

Today 100 limited edition ‘Twosies’ will be available to buy online.

In the run up to Christmas, George at Asda sold over one
 million onesies, and even opened a dedicated onesie store to keep up with demand.

Some think they are adorable, others the height of naff.

At least the twosie is a tad more practical featuring a cape design rather than the legs that most all-in-ones feature, allowing you and your partner to be snuggled close, while still giving you a little bit of freedom.

Exclusive: Despite expecting high demand, ASDA will only be creating 100 of the innovative Twosies

Celebrity fans of the onesie include model Cara Delvigne as well as boy band sensation
 One Direction and singer Miley Cyrus, who all love to share snaps of themselves 
looking cute and cosy in all-in-one numbers.

Fiona Lambert, George Brand Director commented: ‘The onesie was a phenomenon that swept the nation in 2012.

'Demand from customers for more onesie innovation was through the roof and what a perfect way to move on but with the ‘Twosie.’

'We
 expect it to be an instant sell out and 100 lucky couples will be able 
to get their hands on them from today for that special day.'
