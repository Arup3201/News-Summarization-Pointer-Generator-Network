Forget Willy Wonka and his Chocolate Factory and say hello to the brave new world of printing chocolate.

The Hershey Company announced Thursday plans to collaborate with 3D Systems to create 3-D printers to make chocolate and other edibles.

'Whether it's creating a whole new form of candy or developing a new way to produce it, we embrace new technologies such as 3-D printing as a way to keep moving our timeless confectionery treats into the future,' William Papa, head of research and development at Hershey, said in a statement.

As for 3D Systems, they say this is another way to move a new technology into the mainstream.

Financial details on the deal were not released.

While analysts believe the 3-D printing industry is set to see a massive surge in growth through 2020, in-home chocolate printing is probably not realistic in the near future.

'I don't think printing candy bars in the traditional mass market sense will be feasible for a long time,' Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest told the Wall Street Journal.

Twigg says that chocolate printers are something that would more likely be used in retail businesses where people can go in and make their own customized candies.

3D Systems recently unveiled their latest 3-D printer which makes edibles at the Consumer Electronics Show this month. It can make elaborate confectionaries like the one on the left. On the right, another model of 3D systems' printers

And that seemed to be the business plan for 3D systems when they debuted their Chef Jet printer at the Consumer Electronics Show.

They said they were aiming the machines at professional, bakers, pastry chefs, restauranteurs and chocolatiers as pieces of professional kitchen equipment.

'And we're really excited about this because it really opens up 3-D pringint for a completely different group of users. These people are innovators and artists in their own right and we're really excited to be able to inable what they do with this new technology,' a 3D Systems representative said at the trade show.Â

Analysts say the market for 3-D printers will skyrocket in coming years but it's unlikely that in-home chocolate printing will be possible soon
