Victim: Michelle Garvey was 14 when she was last seen on June 1, 1982, and authorities believe she had run away from her home in New London

A teenager found slain in Texas more than 30 years ago has been identified as a Connecticut girl who disappeared in 1982, state police said on Friday.

Michelle Garvey was 14 when she was last seen on June 1, 1982, and authorities believe she had run away from her home in New London.

The girl's remains were found on a field in Houston on July 1, 1982, but her identity remained a mystery until DNA from Garvey's family recently confirmed the match.

Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for Connecticut State Police, said
 the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and authorities 
in Texas contacted Connecticut police about the case in August.

The Harris County Sheriff's Office in Houston exhumed the girl's body to obtain DNA samples, Vance explained.

'Our missing person detectives got involved and got DNA and submitted it to Texas,' the spokesman said.

It was not immediately clear what led authorities in Texas to reach out to Connecticut authorities in connection with the case.

At
 the time that Garvey went missing, authorities said, it was believed 
she was possibly traveling to New Jersey or North Carolina.

Connecticut
 State Police say Garvey's family has been notified and efforts are 
being made to have her remains returned to Connecticut for burial. The 
police investigation is continuing.
