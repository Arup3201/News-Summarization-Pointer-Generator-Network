Roberto Martinez has urged Everton’s squad to make the most of a glorious opportunity as he embraced the club’s return to Europe.

Everton have not played in Europe for five years but they will end their hiatus on Thursday night against Wolfsburg, a team Martinez believes has the quality to play in the Champions League.

Martinez, who is set to welcome Samuel Eto’o back into his squad, feels such an occasion shows that Everton are back where they belong and he is relishing the prospect of plotting his way out of Group H, which also includes Lille and the Russian side Kuban Krasnodar.

This is Martinez’s first chance to manage in Europe and he is confident believes this competition is crucial to his side’s development – and he is confident they have the quality to enable them to pass the test.

The Everton manager said, 'We have been working hard to achieve this opportunity and the only way we will fulfil our potential is with these games. 

'It is a phenomenal challenge for us, with clubs like Wolfsburg and Lille, and the unknown quantity of Krasnodar, but it is one that we need to help our development. Everton should be involved in Europe and that is the target to make it a constant.'

The Toffees' Spanish coach Martinez said on Wednesday that Wolfsburg could be a Champions League team

'We are facing phenomenal opposition and we have got competition for places. As a team, we will get real important experience from this competition. Wolfsburg are very well structured team. 

'They have a good balance, really good experience. They know how to play in these occasions. They have got a really strong side. They could easily be a Champions League team.'

Martinez also paid tribute to £28million summer signing Romelu Lukaku, but played down the significance of his transfer fee.

He said: 'We always get carried about trying to get values and price tags. 

'In Romelu’s case when he arrived he felt at home. He felt understood. 

'Our dressing room has been really solid and is an easy place to arrive. It was a phenomenal effort from the board, especially the chairman, to get him here. We have given him the chance to grow and develop. But football is a team effort and it is very important for the continuity.'

Everton have made a slow start to the season, and conceded 10 goals in their first three Premier League games, but won their first game of the season 2-0 away at West Brom on Saturday.

The Spanish coach said: 'We got back to our natural defensive intensity against West Brom and that is what we needed. We are slowly getting to a very good level.' 

Martinez is also excited about plans for a new stadium in the nearby Walton Hall Park, and added: 'Our fans know that we can’t stand still. We have to look to the highest competitive level we can achieve. 

'Everyone knows this is a new scheme, a regeneration project for the city, many, many new jobs. It is very, very early stages. 

'Goodison Park is unique. It will always be with us, the effect will be there even when we are away from home. That will never go away from our performances.'

Club captain Phil Jagielka also welcomed the return of European football to Goodison Park, and the announcement of a new stadium for the club.

He said: 'The manager has put a very good squad together. We can’t get enough games. Hopefully we can do well in this competition. It will be a very proud moment. My friends and family will be here. We have got to go out and get the right result. We have got some exciting young talent in the squad, they just need pointing in the right direction.

'For us to move forward as a club, there will unfortunately come a time when we will need to move. It is really early stages at the minute.'
