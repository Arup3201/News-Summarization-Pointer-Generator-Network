A 28-year-old television producer who died of cancer this week is posthumously suing a hospital after her diagnosis and treatment were delayed following an alleged error.

Houda Rafle from Toronto, Canada, passed away on Wednesday - just as she had begun legal action against Trillium Health Partners after a radiologist failed to spot a tumor near her heart.

The young television producer had originally gone to Toronto's Trillium Health Centre on March 5 complaining of shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting.

Houda Rafle, 28, died of cancer on Wednesday morning in the intensive care unit of Toronto General Hospital. She had claimed in a lawsuit that a doctor failed to notice a tumour, delaying her diagnosis for five months

She underwent a CT scan which revealed a half-inch mass just above her heart, but radiologist Dr Ivo 'Ivan' Slezic did not notice it, her lawsuit claims.

Five months later she returned to the hospital with a persistent cough and, following further CT scans, the tumor was finally spotted.

By this time it had grown to nearly an inch in size and spread to her lungs, the Toronto Star reported. Doctors diagnosed stage IV angiosarcoma, which eventually spread to her brain.

She subsequently learned that Dr Slezic's role had been restricted months earlier and an external review begun on 3,500 CT scans and mammograms he read between April 2012 and March this year.

Miss Rafle's lawsuit claims that Trillium was negligent in not alerting her to the review, and that Dr Slezic should not have been working because 'his abilities were impaired by fatigue, medical conditions or other factors.'

Her lawyer, Duncan Embury, told the Star: 'She lost her life a as result of failure of the medical system. It’s about accountability in our system. When it comes to disease processes like this, time matters.'

Miss Rafle died in the intensive care unit of Toronto General Hospital in the early hours of Wednesday, her six brothers and sisters by her bedside.

They believe should would still be alive today if her condition was diagnosed earlier.

Her sister Deeqa, 23, told the Star: 'It’s absolutely unfair . . . misdiagnosis, 28, healthy before that, my role model, my best friend, my big sister. It’s a lot.'

Trillium told The Globe And Mail that it had spotted problems with Dr Slezic's work on March 28. A statement on its website said the review into his analyses is now 75 per cent complete.

The case is the latest in a long list of medical testing fiascos in Canada which have fuelled calls for a new nationwide quality assurance system.

Deb Matthews, Ontario's health minister, who spoke with Miss Rafle about her case before her untimely death, said the province is looking for ways to improve quality assurance for radiology.

'We expect the highest standard of care from our hospitals and our dedicated physicians – as do Ontarians,' said Ms Matthews in a statement seen by The Globe And Mail.

'Our hospitals take any questions about the quality of care provided very seriously, and I know that there are always more steps we can take to make our health care system even better.'

Miss Rafle's family say they will continue her legal fight with Trillium. Deeqa Rafle told CBC News Toronto: 'Houda's fight is never [going to] end.

'Our entire family is [going to] keep it alive with every fibre of our being.'
