The mother of two members of the Oxford child sex abuse gang has blamed the schoolgirls for the ordeal they suffered, saying ‘they were having sex at the age of ten instead of playing with toys’.

She defended her sons – Akhtar, 32, and Anjum Dogar, 31 – and claimed they were innocent after they were found guilty of a catalogue of vile offences last week.

Mrs Dogar, believed to be called Bashira, accused the police, social services and the girls themselves of being complicit in creating Britain’s ‘grooming culture’.

The two brothers were part of a group of mainly Asian men who groomed 
girls as young as 11 before giving them drugs and carrying out 
humiliating attacks, then hiring them out for sex with others.

But Mrs Dogar told the Daily Star: ‘These girls should be playing with toys. If they start [having sex] at ten, by 15 they are proper ladies.’

Speaking from her home in Oxford, the Dogars’ mother said they were 
innocent. She said one of the girls was looking for a boy at a station 
in London and no one had pressured her into having sex.

She added: ‘On the news they say the girls went from Oxford to London on
 the train. Are they not old enough then? Nobody can feel sorry for them
 unless they’re sorry themselves.’

Mrs Dogar said that in a Muslim community girls focus on study, and questioned why the authorities allowed it to happen.

Assad Hussain was cleared of raping Child A but convicted of having sex with a child

Akhtar and Anjum Dogar were both found guilty of multiple counts of 
rape, three counts of conspiracy to rape, two counts of arranging child 
prostitution and trafficking a child for sexual exploitation. They are 
due to be sentenced in June along with five other men.

The trial heard that the brothers helped organise ‘parties’ where men would pay for sex.

One victim told Thames Valley Police: ‘I’ve seen them doing it to little girls in their school uniforms.’

A 15-year-old victim who was raped by the gang from the age of 12 and 
sold for sex said she was abused by Akhtar Dogar for three days after 
running away from a children’s home in 2006.

Another girl told of how the brothers trafficked her to be sold for sex at guest houses across the country.

The Dogars and five others have been told they will get lengthy jail sentences after they were found guilty of 59 charges.

Mohammed Karrar, 38, Bassam Karrar, 33, and Kamar Jamil, 27, were each 
found guilty of multiple counts of rape among other offences. Mohammed 
Karrar was also found guilty of supplying heroin.

Assad Hussain, 32, and
 Zeeshan Ahmed, 27, were each found guilty of two counts of sexual 
activity with a child.

Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house
