It's Hot or Not time again as Riath Al-Samarrai reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside.

Radamel Falcao bagged a brace for Colombia on Thursday night, but his double against minnows Bahrain is unlikely to rescue his Manchester United career. 

WHAT'S HOT

RADAMEL FALCAO

The Colombian  scored twice against Bahrain and the skies did not turn dark and deadly plagues did not strike. But looking at Bahrain’s starting XI, his Manchester United resurgence is not a sure thing.

MANNY PACQUIAO

Or rather his massive calves. He gets severe cramps, poor chap, so needs a special anti-inflammatory cream. Alas, he doesn’t have US medical insurance and so each small tube costs £1,200. The £95m he is set to make from fighting Floyd Mayweather should help.

AARON BADDELEY

The Australian golfer played one of the most absurd holes in memory at the par-four 17th in the Texas Open. He hooked his drive way left and went to look for it in the woods but declared it unplayable. He returned to the tee, reloaded and holed his drive from 336 yards for a birdie three. Andrew Magee (2001 Phoenix Open) has the only par-four ace in PGA Tour history.

WHAT'S NOT

FERNANDO ALONSO

The Spaniard (below) has gone rogue. Again. This time he’s blaming his McLaren car for last month’s crash in practice – a version of events disputed by a 37-page report, numerous experts and 300 sensors on the car.

AUDLEY HARRISON

Sad to see a career that has drawn so much derision end with the revelation he is suffering brain injuries and faces bankruptcy. Boxers are a stubborn lot and Harrison was deluded, by his own admission, but those around him should have been stronger.

KEVIN PIETERSEN 

Poor old Pietersen. He jumps through all the hoops to play for Surrey in a competition that no-one really watches, all so he can maybe, hopefully, possibly play for England again... if an asteroid strikes the bus carrying all the selectors. Who could have known that years of egotistical behaviour and slagging off your captain would count for so much?
