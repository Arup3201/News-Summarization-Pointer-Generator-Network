Once a humble wellington boot brand loved by country bumpkins, Hunter has risen to become the footwear of choice for A-listers - and it's all thanks to one man.

Alasdhair Willis, better known to some as Mr Stella McCartney, took the helm as creative director 18 months ago and since then he has given the brand a huge overhaul, introduced trend-led outerwear and ensured his show is one of fashion week's hottest tickets.

As Hunter celebrates the official opening of its first global flagship store at 83 Regent Street in London today, FEMAIL caught up with the brains behind the brand.

'The opening of the Hunter Flagship Store is a massive statement for the brand,' explained Willis, 44.

'It demonstrates our commitment to growing the business and maximising the incredible opportunity this great British brand has.'

And Willis certainly made a statement with the opening event, which saw 28 dancers take over the London street to perform Singin' In The Rain.

Paying tribute to the British capital, the performers arrived in one of the city's iconic red buses - all sporting coats and boots from the latest Hunter Original collection.

Just to ensure all eyes were definitely on the store, a free-runner scaled down the side before the production climaxed with a torrent of water spraying down onto Regent Street.

Inside, the store - which looks a little like a souped-up hay barn - the decor pays homage to the British countryside.

Seating areas resemble the traditional farmhouse boot room, with boots displayed against a backdrop of box hedging and green tiles.

Willis, like his wife a fan of all things high-tech, also oversaw the installation of a five-metre LED screen that cuts through both floors and plays fashion shows and ad campaigns on a loop. 

How fitting: The event was inspired by Gene Kelly's famous performance and Hunter's heritage of protecting from the weather and all terrains

'The design of the store references some classic architectural features and materials that you might traditionally associate with the countryside or the outdoors, but they have been reinvented into an urban context,' he explained.

Fresh from an evening spent having dinner with George Clooney and his new wife, Amal Alamuddin, the 44-year-old told of his plans to ensure that city shoppers get a truly rural shopping experience. 

'The result of this is that you really experience the merging of the countryside and the city under one roof;' he enthuses.

'It is these two worlds coming together that represent what the new Hunter brand is all about.' 

Branching out: It's not just about the traditional boot anymore as Hunter expands its offering with outerwear, knitwear and accessories 

The new store is an extension of the successful relaunch of the brand, which last appeared on the catwalk in front of a front row that included Rita Ora, Anna Wintour and Sir Paul McCartney.

Among the highlights were striking khaki coats  with vibrant yellow and turquoise pockets and super-cool colour block outerwear.

'Hunter as a brand experience has always been about much more than just the Wellington boot,' explained the man behind the re-brand.

'Hunter has always represented emotion, fun, adventure and ultimately memorable experiences. The introduction of the new categories such as outerwear is an obvious and next step for the brand to express the much-loved brand spirit.'

Top designer he might be, but Willis is, at heart, a family man, as the presence of Nancy Shevell, Sir Paul McCartney, and wife Stella McCartney on the sidelines of the SS/15 show made plain.

'The show was a great success for many reasons,' he mused. 'It demonstrated clearly that Hunter can be just as relevant as a spring / summer brand as it is for the winter months. 

'It also clearly expressed the spirit of the brand in an authentic and highly memorable way and lastly it was very well recieved by both the press and the buyers, which is of course key. 

'The support of friends and family is always important - it makes what is a very stressful event much more enjoyable.'

Speaking about the future, he added: 'The brand has undergone a massive transformation in the last 20 months and the ambitions for 2015 are no different. 

'One of the key events in 2015 will be the launch of Hunter Field, which will be the brand’s more technical outdoor collection.

'Hunter Field will offer footwear and outwear to the guy and girl who wants to look amazing in the wilds of the great outdoors, but also need the assurance that the product will perform at the highest level in this environment.'

Founded in 1856, Hunter is a British heritage brand that holds two Royal Warrants of Appointment to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. 

Nevertheless, Willis has another queen in mind - the Queen of London's fashion scene to be precise - when it comes to pinpointing the ultimate Hunter woman.

'It would have to be the queen of the Wellington boot, Kate Moss,' said Willis. 'I can’t think of anyone that wears it better.'
