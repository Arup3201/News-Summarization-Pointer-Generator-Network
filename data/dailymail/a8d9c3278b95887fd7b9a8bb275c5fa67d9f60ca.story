Detectives searching the former home of a convicted murderer in connection with the death of a woman have found a 'number of items of interest'.

More than 40 forensic officers were continuing to scour the former home of the taxi driver, Christopher Halliwell, in connection with the disappearance and death of Becky Godden.

Halliwell told police he killed 20-year-old Miss Godden - and led officers to her shallow grave - but his confession was ruled inadmissible by a judge because he had not been cautioned.

The 55-year-old is currently serving life in jail for the abduction and brutal murder of Sian O'Callaghan who vanished after leaving a nightclub in Swindon, Wiltshire, in March 2011 aged 22.

A detective in charge of the latest probe said: 'We can confirm that a number of items of interest were found at the house and have been sent for analysis by experts.'

After Halliwell took officers to where he buried Miss O'Callaghan in Oxfordshire, Halliwell asked then Detective Supertintendent Steve Fulcher for a cigarette in return for showing police 'another one.'

He the took police to a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, where Miss Godden's body was found.

Despite his confession, Halliwell did not go on trial for her murder because police had not respected arrest guidelines.

Miss Godden, a drug-addicted prostitute, was last seen alive by a police officer in Swindon on December 27, 2002. She had not been reported missing to the police because her family believed she was living in Bristol working through her problems.

Detective Chief Inspector Sean Memory, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Activity at the house in Ashbury Avenue continues today with over 40 staff members working on the investigation.

'Yesterday blood dogs from South Wales Police scoured the property and forensically-trained crime scene investigators commenced a finger-tip search.

'We can confirm that a number of items of interest were found at the house and have been sent for analysis by experts.'

A forensic tent was put up outside Halliwell's former semi-detached house in Swindon yesterday and a police officer stood outside while searches were taking place.

The house belonged to Halliwell before he was convicted of Miss O'Callaghan's murder, by which time he had moved down the street.

The current owners of the house have been forced to move out while police searches take place and have no connection to the investigation.

As part of the investigation flooring has been removed and a wall and loft spaced searched. 

The search is expected to take around a week.

Police are also distributing renewed appeal posters in the local area and Mr Memory is urging anyone who saw Miss Godden over Christmas 2002 and into the new year to get in touch.

'Detectives have been speaking to residents in the area and gathering information regarding Becky's disappearance, this work will also continue throughout today along with the poster campaign,' Mr Memory said.

'People have come forward with helpful information who have not contacted us previously as they didn't think it would be relevant.

'I cannot stress strongly enough how important it is to let us know any information you have, as the smallest detail may be the key to justice for Becky and her family.

'We know that Becky was last seen on December 27 2002 and we need people to come forward with any information about where she was in early 2003. Did you see Becky over the new year period?

'I would like to reiterate our thanks to the occupants of the house, who have no involvement in this investigation, and the local community for their assistance and co-operation.

'I anticipate that the road closure at Ashbury Avenue will remain in place until the end of the week.'

Det Supt Fulcher, who was suspended over his mishandling of the original case, resigned from Wiltshire Police in May this year after he was investigated by the police watchdog and found guilty of gross misconduct.

Halliwell has also been linked with the disappearances of at least three other young women across the West Country, but has never been charged.

The house's current occupants have been moved out during the search and are not linked to the probe

Police have now set up a forensic tent outside Halliwell's former home in Swindon in relation to the an investigation into Miss Godden's disappearance

Miss Godden's mother, Karen Edwards, has previously criticised the force's suspension of Det Supt Fulcher, who she credits as a 'hero' for finding out what had happened to her missing daughter.

The latest searches come after police teams scouring an area alongside a pond earlier this year found boots thought to have belong to Miss O'Callaghan, along with the remains of a shotgun and up to 600 other items that could be linked to crime. 

Officers discovered the pile of items under a layer of mud, as well as a chunky knit cardigan.

The major effort at the rural spot, near the quiet village of Ramsbury, Wiltshire, was stepped up after the discovery on May 15 of a boot, which police suspect belonged to Miss O'Callaghan.

As officers held a press briefing near the pond on May 16 to announce their finding, a second boot was found. Further searches revealed the remains of a shotgun.

Detectives suggested at the time that the items found at the site may be the key to solving other murders.
