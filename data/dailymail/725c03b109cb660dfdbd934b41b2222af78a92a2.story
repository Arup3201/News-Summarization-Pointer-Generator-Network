To some he is hero, a selfless freedom fighter who liberated his nation after years of oppression.

But to others he is a ruthless terrorist who lit the fuse for World War One, plunging Europe into years of darkness and despair.

Now, 100 years after 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, as they rode through Sarajevo, the act continues to create bitter divisions in a deeply fractured country.

Among those caught in the middle of the row is Princip's great nephew who was given his name and still resides in 
East Sarajevo, where he runs a hotel.

Serbs
 who fled the region are collecting money to rebuild the 
family home in time for the centenary on June 28.

Princip's house is one of hundreds of 
gutted homes scarring the bleak plateau, untouched since they were 
sacked by Croat forces on the heels of fleeing Serbs at the end of the 
Bosnian war. The Sarajevo footprints have gone.

The house was razed three times, 
during the two world wars and again in 1995. They're wasting their time,
 said Gavrilo.

'It will be 
burned down and destroyed again,' he said. 'We build and then we 
destroy. That's how things are in Bosnia.'

Fateful day: Archduke Ferdinand and his wife Sophie ride through Sarajevo one hour before they were shot and killed by Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip

Bosnian Serb forces under Ratko Mladic attempted just that eight decades later.

Sarajevo
 mayor Ivo Komsic, a Bosnian Croat, noted the city's role in the two 
wars that framed the last century when unveiling plans for the centenary
 last month.

'The
 eyes of the world will be focused on Sarajevo once more and it is 
important that we send messages completely different from the messages 
of war sent in 1914 and 1992,' he said.

Such
 comparisons have riled Serbs in Bosnia and neighbouring Serbia, for 
whom Princip is a pan-Slavic hero, the shot he fired marking the death 
knell for centuries of foreign occupation over Serbs, Croats and 
Bosniaks alike.

Archduke Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, alongside his wife, Sophie on June 28 1914.

Eventually killed by 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, the couple had earlier that day been attacked by another man who threw a grenade at their car.

Archduke Ferdinand was shot in the neck, while his wife was hit in the abdomen.

The assassination is believed to have started a domino effect which led to the break out of the First World War a month later.

Princip and others wanted Bosnia to become part of Serbia.

This action led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia.

After that Serbia's ally Russia, and Russia's allies France and Britain, were pulled into conflict with Austria-Hungary and its treaty partner, Germany.

Two rival sets of events are being 
planned, and accusations of 'revisionism' are flying at a time of 
renewed Cold War-style tensions between East and West.

The
 row goes to the heart of Bosnia today, a country still affected by 
big-power divisions and still arguing about the past, divided by the 
present and uncertain about the future.

'We haven't moved on,' said Bosnian historian Vera Katz. 'It's like we're 100 years before 1914, not 100 years after.'

Sarajevo bookended the 20th century, 
opening with Princip's Browning revolver and closing with the sniper 
rifles and mortars of his ethnic kin besieging the city from the hills 
during Bosnia's 1992-95 war.

To some, like the woman at the museum, the two events were part of the same arc of Serb nationalism.

According
 to that narrative, Princip was a 'terrorist' bent on uniting Orthodox 
Serb lands at the expense of Bosnia's Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic 
Croats.

This was the official narrative for decades in socialist Yugoslavia, when Princip was venerated as a freedom fighter for all the nations and faiths gathered together by Josip Broz Tito.

Schools and roads took the assassin's name. His footprints were enshrined in the pavement at the spot from which he fired.

In his native mountain region of Bosansko Grahovo, a plaque erected in 1949 still stands above the doors to the local school, hailing Princip's 'fearless' fight for the 'national freedom of our peoples'.

Today, the plaque is blackened, licked by the flames that razed the school in 1995 as Yugoslavia crumbled.

Sarajevo, now inhabited largely by Bosniaks, plans to mark the centenary of the assassination with a series of cultural events sponsored in large part by France and also with the help of Austria and possibly the European Union.

It will take place at a sensitive 
time in international relations, with Western nations accusing Serb big 
power backer Russia of preparing to annex Crimea from Ukraine and Moscow
 arguing it is defending Russians from Western stooges in Kiev.

Organisers of the Sarajevo 
commemoration, who are hoping to get funding from the EU, say it will 
steer clear of the issue of whether Princip was terrorist or hero.

The
 centrepiece will be a concert of the Vienna Philharmonic in the city's 
much-loved Vijecnica, Sarajevo's city hall-turned-National Library that 
burned down at the start of the 43-month Bosnian Serb siege of the city.
 The concert will mark its reopening.

On
 June 27, French philosopher Bernard Henri-Levy, who supported the 
Bosniak call for Western intervention to halt the war in Bosnia, will 
premiere his latest play in Sarajevo, which deals specifically with the 
1992-95 conflict.

Bosnia's 
autonomous Serb Republic has refused to participate, except in a leg of 
the Tour de France cycling race in the capital on June 20-23.

Instead,
 the Serbs plan their own ceremony in Visegrad, a town made famous by 
Ivo Andric's 1945 novel 'Bridge on the Drina', and infamous by Serb 
paramilitaries who tossed their victims from the Ottoman bridge in 1992 
as the first waves of the war washed through eastern Bosnia.

The
 Serb events will be choreographed by filmmaker Emir Kusturica, a 
Sarajevan born into a Bosniak family but who later took on the Serbian 
Orthodox faith, who plans to stage an opera about the assasination and 
show a documentary about Princip.

Authorities in Serb-controlled East Sarajevo say plans are in the pipeline for a statue of the assassin.

'We
 once all lived in one state (Yugoslavia), and we never looked on it as 
any kind of terrorist act, as some historians try to present it today,' 
said Nenad Samardzija, the Serb mayor of East Sarajevo.

'We looked on it as a movement of young people who wanted to liberate themselves from colonial slavery.'

The contradictions are inevitable, said sociology professor Slavo Kukic.

'Through
 no fault of his own, Gavrilo Princip is the result of all those 
political conflicts and differences on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia ... over the past quarter of a century,' he said. 'We've had 
many Gavrilo Princips in our recent past.'

The demands of each side in Bosnia have changed little since its war - while the Bosniaks want a more centralised, unified state, the Croats say they need their own entity like the Serbs.

Serb leaders, meanwhile, look east to Serbia, saying they have little need for Bosnia at all, much as pro-Moscow forces now in Crimea are looking to Russia and rejecting Ukraine.

The political system put in place in Bosnia by a U.S.-brokered peace deal in 1995 divvied up power along ethnic lines, fuelling corruption, stifling development and triggering unrest last month unprecedented since the war.

The historian Katz, her office unheated since the war because the state History Institute can't afford the bills, said all the centenary plans were inappropriate given the far more pressing economic and political problems facing Bosnia.

'It's like putting on makeup when you haven't even had a bath,' she said.
