Tom Huddlestone could have written his name in the Hull City history books as the club's first European goalscorer on their continental debut.

Instead, he inked an unwanted entry as the player guilty of perhaps their worst-ever miss.

Tied goalless on the hour during their Europa League third-round qualifier with AS Trencin in the Slovakian city of Zilna, Hull won a penalty when Shane Long was tripped inside the area.

Huddlestone's tame effort was kept 
out by Milos Volesak but the midfielder was presented with a shot at 
redemption when the ball rebounded into his path.

But
 with an open net to aim at the former Spurs man somehow contrived to 
volley against the top of the crossbar from just six yards and his sorry
 strike cannoned into the disbelieving 600 away fans behind the goal.

Manager
 Steve Bruce said: 'From where I was sat it was easier to score (the 
rebound). You would put your house on him to score (the penalty) though.

'We've missed the last three or four now, so we best start practising them.'

Sone
 Aluko, David Meyler and Long all headed over the crossbar in the first 
half from good positions but the hosts were the better side after the 
break.

It leaves the 
Tigers with a nervy second leg at the KC Stadium next Thursday, and 
Bruce – who handed second-half debuts to Tom Ince and Robert Snodgrass -
 added: 'I knew it would be difficult especially as we're in middle of 
pre-season.

High flyer: Ahmed Elmohamady risest highest for the ball against Trencin's Milan Rundic

'They were technically very good and have dangerous players on the counter-attack.

'But one thing you have to do is take chances when they come your way.

'We've had one or two great opportunities and that would have made the second leg more comfortable.

'But, overall, we will be better for it because this was our first competitive game.'
