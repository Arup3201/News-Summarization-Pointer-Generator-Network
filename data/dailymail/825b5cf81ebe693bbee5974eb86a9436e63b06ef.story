London's skyline was speckled with pink last night as its most famous landmarks were lit up in support of the UK's leading breast cancer research charity.

Buckingham Palace, Nelson's Column, the Tower of London and the BT Tower were among the capital's icons that were bathed in a rosy glow to mark the launch of Breast Cancer Campaign's action month.

The event aims to raise awareness about the devastating disease, its effects and ways to prevent it throughout October.

London was followed by major cities across the world, from New York to Tokyo, who also shone fuchsia spotlights on their own iconic buildings for the cause.

Baroness Delyth Morgan, Breast Cancer Campaign's chief executive, said: 'Twelve thousand women still die from breast cancer every year in the UK. Millions more - survivors, their friends and families - are living with its impact every single day.

'Whilst much progress has been made in diagnosing and treating the disease, there is still so much more to do before we can say we've beaten it.'

She added: 'Throughout October, everyone can do something to help: from wearing it, buying it, turning it or painting it pink, through to encouraging friends and family to be more aware of the signs and symptoms - every action will help move us closer to curing the disease.'

Other London landmarks that lit up pink include HMS Belfast, Somerset House, Tower 42, the Blue Fin Building and Heron Tower.

Tower 42's Vertigo Bar was the venue for the breast cancer action month launch party where guests got panoramic views of the pink-coloured sites.

Meanwhile a host of celebrities turned out in pink in support of the campaign.

In New York, Liz Hurley wore a pink wrap dress as she appeared to turn on the pink lights on top of the Empire State Building.

And in London and number of showbiz regulars climbed London's Tower 42 to the Vertigo Bar for the launch of Breast Cancer Campaign's action month.
