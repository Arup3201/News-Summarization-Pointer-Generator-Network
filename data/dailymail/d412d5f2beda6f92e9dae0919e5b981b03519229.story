When the Celtic manager might just be the most popular inhabitant of the Ibrox directors’ box, it tells you everything about where Rangers are right now.

Even in the annals of the bitter saga surrounding this crisis-riven club, these were extraordinary scenes.

Mounted police stood guard in front of the main entrance to the stadium before Friday night’s truncated game against Hearts as tensions crackled amid angry protests.

Inside, Ronny Deila - here on a spying mission ahead of the League Cup semi-final with assistant John Collins - found himself perched in front of the Easdale brothers, James and Sandy, and finance director Barry Leach. None of the ire vented on Friday night was sent in his direction.

When a farcical game on a snow-bound pitch was then abandoned after 25 minutes, it provided the cue for another outpouring of ill-feeling.

No sooner had referee Bobby Madden’s whistle stilled than chants of ‘Sack the board’ rang out from all four stands.

Hundreds of fans answered the call for a mass protest at 7pm - despite sub-zero temperatures - thronging around the barriers erected in front of Ibrox.

It was a response to advance notices of security over the stadium and Murray Park being lodged on behalf of Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct firm. 

The move is seen as a precursor to the board accepting a £10million loan from Ashley ahead of a rival funding offer from Douglas Park’s consortium known as the Three Bears.

Chants against Ashley and the Easdales filled the bitterly cold air.

Banners tied to the fence across the road spelled out the message further. ‘Ibrox belongs to fans’ and ‘Hands off our club’. Much more colourful language was also being aired.

The odd snowball was lobbed over the lines early on before a point was reached when part of the crowd seemed to surge and the police decided a greater presence was required to ensure control.

More vans arrived, accompanied by a clutch of officers on horseback, who moved into position in front of the barriers.

When the ground emptied ahead of schedule at around 8.10pm, a second protest formed in the same place, fans again voicing their feelings against the board in the strongest possible terms. This time, a group of supporters also flooded into the entrance to Argyle House at the opposite side of the stadium, filmed on a video camera holding a banner reading: ‘Rangers F.C. supported by fans, directed by parasites'. 

For a support that doesn’t traditionally indulge in protests, the numbers were significant. As was the widespread chanting inside the ground.

It seems the prospect of Ashley gaining security over Ibrox has achieved the near impossible in effectively uniting a fractured Rangers support.

Even the club’s own in-house fan group has called on chief executive Derek Llambias and chairman David Somers to come clean about what is being planned with the Newcastle United owner.

The Rangers Fan Board (RFB) is an official supporter liaison group, set up by former chief executive Graham Wallace. The body is closest of all to the hierarchy but has told the board it will never back moves to mortgage off Ibrox.

‘The RFB are today insisting on clarity from Rangers chief executive Derek Llambias and chairman David Somers following revelations that Ibrox and Murray Park could be used as security in return for additional funding,’ read their statement.

‘RFB would like to state that we will never support any moves which could see Ibrox, or the training complex used in this manner.

‘We have already requested information from Mr Llambias as to the board’s intentions in regard to the Mike Ashley loan offer and, so far, the CEO has said:”At this moment in time, there has not been a deal done with anyone with regard to loaning the club funds. We are in talks with a number of parties and, hopefully, an announcement will be made shortly with this effect to the Stock Exchange”.

‘An announcement was subsequently made but it did not come close to clarifying the situation and that is why we are pushing for a meeting with the CEO and chairman.

‘We need a categoric assurance that our stadium, which is hugely symbolic, a monument to what this club means will never be used as security.

‘It is alarming that advance notices of security were lodged with the Register of Scotland on January 13.

‘We must stress again that we would strongly oppose the securitisation of Ibrox. The very notion fills us with dread and since RFB was brought into being to bridge the gap between supporters and the board, we believe it is incumbent upon the directors to meet with us as a matter of urgency.’

The strength of those words was telling about the current mood. Furthermore, Rangers First — a fan-ownership group — have made contact with the club’s nominated advisor WH Ireland to express their concerns about Ashley’s powerplay — which prevents anyone else taking security on either asset for 35 days.

‘The Rangers First board have written to RIFC’s NOMAD to express some of the concerns that have been voiced to us by members over the last 24 hours,’ they said.

‘We expressed our deep concern about a notice of intention to grant security being lodged over Ibrox.

‘Granting such a notice, at a time when shareholders have been assured that RIFC are currently considering various proposals, seems to provide the party in whose favour the notice has been granted with an unfair advantage whilst, at the same time, prejudicing the ability to advance discussions with other potential providers of funding.

‘We advised that we couldn’t see how that was in the best interests of shareholders and requested an urgent explanation.

‘We indicated that we had been inundated with requests from members to take every possible step to prevent security being granted over Ibrox.

‘We would call on every shareholder to contact RIFC’s NOMAD in similar terms to ensure the NOMAD is aware of the weight of shareholder opinion on this issue.’
