Victim: John Kiernan, pictured, was killed by heroin addict Phillip Haslam and left for two weeks

A heroin addict that bound and gagged a burglary victim before battering him to death with a brick was today issued a life sentence.

Phillip Haslam, 36, was found guilty at Northampton Crown Court of murdering vulnerable John Kiernan, 62, in his own home and will serve a minimum of 32 years.

Mr Justice Henriques told Haslam: 'Your behaviour was brutal, merciless and wicked.'

Haslam repeatedly targeted the home of Mr Kiernan and in September last year 'hog-tied' him using electrical cable and gagged him with a sock before leaving him to die after the brutal attack.

The court heard Haslam was searching for money to fund his heroin addiction and even made Mr Kiernan sign a £90 cheque when he could not find any cash before assaulting him.

Shockingly, the victim’s body may have laid undiscovered for up to two weeks after Haslam returned to the flat in the days after his death and moved Mr Kiernan’s mail so as not to arouse neighbours’ concerns.

When police finally broke into the address on October 1, they found Mr Kieran’s decomposing body on the bed with his hands and feet bound behind his back.

A pair of trainers and gloves with traces of Mr Kiernan’s blood on them found at Haslam’s address linked him to the murder.

Haslam, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, admitted two burglaries but denied killing Mr Kiernan.

But a jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict yesterday following a three week trial.

The judge said: 'That verdict was inevitable. There are few murder trials where the evidence is so completely overwhelming and unanswerable.

'Indeed the defendant himself failed to answer the allegations (in not giving evidence).'

Haslam was also sentenced to eight years for robbery and 40 months for two burglaries.

He also admitted a separate incident on 1 September 2011, where another vulnerable man - aged 62 from Kettering - was savagely robbed.

During this incident, Mr Haslam’s 
girlfriend, Christine Windle, 37, lured the man to a block of flats 
where Haslam repeatedly hit him over the head with a hammer, causing 
head injuries and breaking his fingers.

Windle pleaded guilty to this offence and was sentenced to six years for robbery and two years for handling stolen goods.

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Woliter, from Northamptonshire Police, who led the investigation, said: 'Mr Kiernan was a vulnerable and lonely man who was targeted by Phillip Haslam in August and September 2011, repeatedly burgling his house. He used fear and violence to steal money from Mr Kiernan to fund his spiralling drug and alcohol habit.

'On 19 September 2011, when Mr Kiernan tried to resist Phillip Haslam’s demands and threats, he was ultimately subjected to a brutal and savage attack where he was tied up and beaten to death.

'I welcome today’s sentence which resulted in Phillip Haslam being sentenced to life imprisonment.

'My thoughts are with Mr Kiernan’s family during what has been a difficult year. Whilst horrendous cases like this are rare, the sentence today shows that those who commit crime will be bought to justice.'
