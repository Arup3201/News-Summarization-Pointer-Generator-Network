Britain's rotten summer hit a new low last night as it suffered its coldest August evening in 40 years - but that didn't stop children making the most of their last few days off from school.

Despite some areas dropping to below -2C last night, surfers were out in force today, while children happily splashed around in the waves at Tynemouth Beach in North Tyneside.

The pre-school rush left roads busy this evening as parents travelled home from their holidays in preparation for their children returning to school next week.

Braving the cold: Thrill seekers make the most of the final day of summer by going for a dip in the chilly sea at Tynemouth Beach in North Tyneside

Coldest August in 40 years: The surfers at Tynemouth Beach in North Tyneside didn't seem to mind the poor weather

It comes after a disappointing summer that has been the wettest in a century.

The Highlands, Aberdeenshire and 
Northumberland had a frost overnight while most parts of the UK were 
close to freezing as most Britons shivered in their beds.

Braemar in Scotland was the coldest spot as it dropped to -2.1C (28.22 Fahrenheit), followed by Aviemore near Loch Ness on -1.8C and -0.7C in north-east England.

The only night that was colder came on August 21 1973, when Lagganlia in the Highlands dropped to -4.5C.

But outside the Highlands some weather stations are likely to have had record lows for their areas.

Bradford in West Yorkshire had its coldest August night since records began in 1908 at 2.8C.

As this unseasonal chill swept across the
 UK it coincided with an astronomical phenomenon - a blue moon. This 
means there will be two full moons in a month, with one at the start of 
August and another today.

The
 temperatures, which reflect the country's cold and soggy weather over 
recent months, have proved this summer has been a complete write-off.

It came as it was revealed yesterday the summer has also been the wettest in England and Wales for a century.

Unusual cold winds have dragged down the temperature over night, experts said today.

'Last night saw northerly winds drag cold air from quite a long way north over the UK. This air was also dry, which meant there was very little moisture to help retain heat from the day,' a Met Office spokesman said.

'This, combined with clear skies caused by the high pressure sitting over the country, meant all the heat radiated into the sky – leaving very cold temperatures for the time of year.'

Once in a blue moon: The full moon this Friday morning over Saddleworth Moor following the coldest August night in 40 years. The moor was around 2C lat night.

Rare: This Blue Moon seen over the M62 motorway this morning is very unusual - as it is the second full moon this month

The miserable temperatures top off a terrible summer.

Braemar, Aberdeenshire: -2.4 °CAviemore, Highlands: -1.8 °CRedesdale Camp, Northumberland: -0.7 °CBainbridge, North Yorkshire: 0.5 °CBenson, Oxfordshire: 2.1 °CBradford, West Yorkshire: 2.8 °C

Data released by MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, showed that 14.25ins or 362mm of rain fell in June, July and August so far, outstripping the previous worst period in 1912.

MeteoGroup forecaster Nick Prebble said this summer is set to be the fourth wettest since records began in 1727.

June 2012 was the wettest since 1860, had the least sunshine since 1909 and was the coldest since 1991.

Mr Prebble said: 'June was wet, dull and cold. It was pretty relentless low pressure, very unsettled weather and a thoroughly miserable month.

'July wasn't as wet as June but it was still wetter than average.

'We haven't quite got to the end of August yet but we're expecting rainfall to be a few millimetres above the average.'

MeteoGroup said 14.06in (357mm) of rain has fallen in Scotland during the summer so far, compared with an average of 11.42in (290mm).

The night of cold calm last night came after a Tornado, lightning, flash floods and landslides have wreaked havoc across Britain as Mother Nature struck with terrifying force.

A frightening twist to the summer: The dramatic tornado hit the seaside town of Clevedon, near Bristol yesterday

Can it get any worse? The freak weather is just one more example of the miserable weather the UK has endured this summer

Homes
 and businesses were cleared and temporary shelters set up yesterday as 
more than two inches of rain fell in just a few hours across the 
North-West.

The Environment Agency issued 11 flood alerts across the country.

In St Bees, Cumbria’s western-most 
point, almost an inch of rain fell in just an hour causing a landslide 
which later derailed a train in scenes akin to those wrought by Hurricane Isaac in Louisiana.

The 100 passengers on board, mainly 
workers heading towards the Sellafield nuclear plant, escaped without 
injury after the accident at 6.45am.

In Egremont, west Cumbria, up to 150 
homes were hit by flash flooding with the Fire Service saying it had 
received 100 calls for help, mainly involving requests for sandbags.

And in an illustration of  the weather’s powerful unpredictability, twisters were seen above Clevedon, Somerset.

In Pudsey, West Yorkshire, Bernard 
Williams, 55, an assistant headmaster, had a lucky escape after 
lightning struck a tree as he climbed out of his car. He made it indoors
 just seconds before the 40ft-willow came crashing to the ground.

The torrential rain caused the cliff face to collapse and washed away the natural inferastructure

A commuter train had a lucky escape this morning after being derailed after a landslip washed away part of the cliff during flash flooding

Downpour: Despite the shock of the impact the train thankfully stayed upright saving the lives of passengers on board. There were no reported injuries to staff or passengers

His wife Alison, 43, said: ‘If  he had
 been stood at the car four seconds later he would almost certainly have
 been killed or maimed.’

A spokesman for the Met Office said 
the worst of the weather had passed and that the next three days are 
expected to be relatively dry with only scattered showers.

Temperatures will not beas cold this evening, experts have said.

'Cloud and any rain across southeast England will clear, becoming dry. 
Elsewhere, also becoming mostly dry and fine with showers dying away, 
but they will continue around Northern Ireland, western Scotland and 
some western coastal areas with a southwesterly breeze,' the Met Office said.

The turbulent weather will rekindle 
memories of the Jubilee weekend in June, when street parties across the 
country were sullied by drizzle.

The Thames river pageant also proved a
nightmare for spectators, many of whom travelled to London only to be 
drenched by heavy showers.

Last weekend's Bank Holiday was also a complete washout, with torrential rain and massive thunder storms sweeping across much of the country.

Revellers at the Leeds and Reading Festivals had to brave showers, while others across the country found themselves in a marathon 12-hour deluge.

Many of us had already rolled the barbecues back into the garden shed, resigned to the fact that the sunshine was over.

Roads were busier than usual as parents travelled home from their family summer holidays in preparation for their children returning to school next week.

The M25 was the worst affected with queues tailing back to junction 27 and Junction 28 after an accident earlier in the day.

The M4 London bound was also heavily congested between junction 8 and 6.

The A406, A30 and A13 also had delays.

Then the heavens opened – and stayed open in some areas from first thing in the morning to well into the evening on Saturday and continued in some places on the Sunday.

Huge events like iconic British sporting events like Wimbledon were also badly hit by bad weather and only the Olympics escaped.

Senior forecaster at Meteogroup, Stephen Davenport said: 'It is hard to point the finger at any one cause for such a disappointing summer, or indeed for the fact that this has been pretty much the sixth in a row, with 2006 the last with any lengthy periods of dry and hot weather.

'We can say that the atmospheric circulation around the northern hemisphere has been rather weak for much of the time during those years, and this lends itself to what meteorologists call blocking, whereby a pattern of low and high pressure around the hemisphere becomes locked in for long periods as the jet stream that shapes and holds them loops lazily and extravagantly around the globe.

'It is unfortunate for those wanting to break out the flip-flops and shorts that the British Isles have found themselves under stagnant low pressure rather more often than high pressure.'

High point: Only during the Olympics did good weather return, raising spirits, nit just because of the fantastic sport
