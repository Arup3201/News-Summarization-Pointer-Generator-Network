Corporal Thomas Shute (pictured) admitted misdemeanor assault

Four British soldiers have admitted being involved in a fight with an off-duty policeman outside a New York City bar.

The soldiers were on a military rugby team trip when the row broke out at 4am on August 30.

Criminal complaints say the officer was punched and his mobile phone was taken.

Reports at the time said the row began
inside the Mercury Bar before spilling out into the street where the 
off-duty officer pulled out a knife.

Court records show Lance Corporal 
Ratu-losefo Yavala, 33, yesterday pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault 
and petit larceny, while Corporal Thomas Shute, 34, admitted misdemeanor
assault.

Private Mosese Kurulala, 27, and Private Iliakini Raderua, 30, pleaded guilty to violations, which are not crimes under US law.

Shute, who is the only British member of the squad, was given a one-year conditional discharge, ordered to carry out five days of community service and fined £314 at the New York Criminal Court.

He was also told to pay fees and a surcharge totalling £157.

The other three, who are all from Fiji, were sentenced to community service and fines. All four men serve in the Royal Scots Borderers, an infantry battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Bar: The fight began inside but then spilled out onto the street

A battalion spokeswoman said: 'We have noted the findings of the court.

'Those who have been charged in relation to criminal offences will have that recorded on their record and it will affect their careers.

'Those who have had their charges dropped may still be liable to administrative action at the discretion of their commanding officer.'

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the foursome will face disciplinary action.

He said: 'All those who are found to fall short of the Army’s high standards or who are found to have committed an offence under the Armed Forces Act are dealt with administratively (up to and including discharge) or through the discipline process, as appropriate. 

'We have a common law and Data Protection Act duty to protect the personal information of our employees and, as such, we are not prepared to release any personal information relating to this case.'

It was earlier revealed that Yavala has been in the Army for 11 years and Shute is a 12-year veteran.
