Apple has published a statement acknowledging that it failed in a legal action over Samsung’s Galaxy tablet computer.

The American electronics giant was instructed to make the ruling public after losing its case that the Samsung Galaxy Tab was too similar to its own product.

A judge at the High Court in London ruled in July that the Galaxy tablet was not 'cool' enough to be confused with Apple’s iPad.

Apple challenged the finding at the Court of Appeal, but the appeal was dismissed earlier this month.

Three judges upheld the decision of Judge Colin Birss QC that three Samsung Galaxy tablet computers did not infringe Apple’s registered design.

Judge Birss said earlier this year: 'They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design.

'They are not as cool.'

He said consumers were not likely to get the two tablet computers mixed up.

The Court of Appeal judges upheld his ruling and rejected Apple’s challenge against an order he made that it must publicise the fact that it had lost the case.

Apple on its website reported that the High Court had ruled that the Samsung Galaxy did not infringe Apple’s registered design, and that the judgment had been upheld by the Court of Appeal on October 18.

Apple's apology still made clear it thought it had the superior product

The launch comes as Apple’s stock dipped nearly $100 after delivering  a second 
straight quarter of disappointing results, with iPad sales falling well 
short of Wall Street's targets.

It is believed consumers were waiting for the new model to be announced.

Shares
in the world's most valuable technology company briefly fell to levels 
not seen since the start of August, after it delivered a 27 per cent 
rise in revenue for its fourth quarter while earnings rose 24 per cent.

The
numbers, while in line with expectations, lacked the positive surprises
that investors had grown used to and came after Apple undershot revenue
targets in the previous quarter.

During
Apple's call to announce its results, boss Tim Cook also opined on 
Microsoft's new Windows 8-based Surface tablet that will hit stores in 
the wee hours of Friday.

‘I
haven't personally played with the Surface yet, but what we're reading 
about it, is that it's a fairly compromised, confusing product,’ he 
said. ‘I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I 
don't think it would do all of those things very well.’
