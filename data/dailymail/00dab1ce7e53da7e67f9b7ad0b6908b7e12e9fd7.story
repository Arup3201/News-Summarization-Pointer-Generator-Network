And you thought romance was dead? Then think again because everybody is in love with this kid Harry Kane.

It was the game of his life, like watching someone win the goal of the season, player of the year and world player of the year award all on the same night. It will have to end with an England call up.

Here at White Hart Lane, when Mauricio Pochettino’s team put away their great London rivals Chelsea 5-3, Kane was magnificent.

Harry Kane was in sensational form on New Year's Day as he scored twice in the 5-3 win over Chelsea

He scored twice, won a penalty for Andros Townsend to convert in first half injury time and set up the fifth for Nacer Chadli.

At the final whistle this remarkable young man milked the moment, taking his time to leave his field of dreams and lapping up the applause from Tottenham supporters. He was entitled to do so.

Kane owns the place now, the main man in this team as they continue their charge up the table. They have to fancy themselves for fourth.

In a performance that most analysts would agree was borderline ‘complete’, Kane made mugs of two of the best defenders in English football.

He embarrassed Gary Cahill to such an extent that the Chelsea defender booted Kane in the back in frustration when things were going against them. For good measure, Cahill then kicked his calf.

‘I didn’t see it, but he did complain afterwards that his back is a little bit sore,’ revealed Pochettino.

What a silly boy, losing his rag with Kane because this young Spurs striker had turned him this way and that for 90, frankly, mesmerising minutes.

Terry, perhaps the finest English central defender of his generation, was way off the pace here. Kane murdered the pair of them.

‘It shows how good we are, scoring five goals against one of the best defences in the world and it is all coming together,’ claimed Kane.

‘We are delighted, we want to keep this run going. I am enjoying it, especially as we get so much stick from the Chelsea supporters.’ This time we only ever heard from Tottenham, chirping up when Kane scored a magnificent equaliser from the edge of the area.

What an iconic figure he has become, a talisman in this Tottenham team as they try to make a move on the top four. They are on their way there.

He scores goals in every competition: Europa League, Capital One Cup and Premier League. On Monday, he can’t wait to get his teeth stuck into Burnley.

Kane has scored 17 times now and he will be under consideration for a place in the England squad when Roy Hodgson finally returns from an extra long Christmas holiday.

Wherever he is in the world England’s head coach will have heard about this because this remarkable young man is one of the most talked about footballers in the Premier League at this moment.

‘We need to be careful with him, but we cannot hide him away,’ admitted Pochettino after his first ever victory against a team put out by Jose Mourinho.

‘The national team is not my decision, but we try to improve him every day and if the England coach believes in him and wants to give him the opportunity it is good.

‘Harry is still young, but in the last few months he has had the chance to play more and show his qualities. We are happy with that.’ In the final moments, when Kane was motioning with his arms to tell his team-mates to calm down and see this extraordinary game out, it was like watching a future Tottenham captain.

He is having that effect around the place, galvanising the Tottenham supporters as they start to make an impression in the higher reaches of the table.

Credit to them because even when they went a goal down at White Hart Lane, they stayed with their team. What a difference that made.

They believed in them, waiting patiently for Kane to take this game by the scruff of the neck. The kid isn't afraid of anyone.

Tottenham fans show so much passion for him here, belting out his name at the top of their voices after his second beat Thibaut Courtois in the 52nd minute.

On Monday, in an FA Cup third round tie with Burnley, the love affair continues.
