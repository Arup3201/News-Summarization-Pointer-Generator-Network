West Bromwich Albion will not sell Saido Berahino this window because his goals are too valuable in the club’s battle to stay up, chairman Jeremy Peace has insisted.

It had been thought a £20million offer from Liverpool or Tottenham might see Albion accept, after head coach Tony Pulis and technical director Terry Burton admitted every player has his price.

But Peace has moved to reaffirm that the England Under 21 striker, who has six goals in his last four games and 14 for the season, will remain at the Hawthorns for the run-in.

'I said in the autumn that the club had no interest in selling Saido and that remains the case,’ said Peace in a statement on the club’s website. 'Unless Tony decides otherwise, the view will surely be that he is far too important to us to consider trading. His goals are capable of keeping us in the Premier League and would be hugely difficult to replace.'

Berahino has been in the spotlight over his conviction for drink-driving, while Albion suspended negotiations on a new contract over concerns about his attitude. The 21-year-old was fined for turning up late to matches. Peace said Berahino has reacted well to the arrival of Pulis, however.

'The club takes seriously the charges to which Saido pleaded guilty and as a result he will be subject to the club’s disciplinary procedures,’ added Peace. 'This unfortunate episode has been unsettling for the club generally and Saido specifically.

'What has been pleasing for everyone around the club has been the clear sign that Saido has responded positively to the arrival of Tony Pulis and a new coaching team and is displaying clear signs of showing that where it matters most – on the pitch.

'Tony has certainly been delighted with him and it is heartening for everyone to see a young man moving forward in the right direction again.’

Two players who are set to leave Albion are summer recruits Silvestre Varela and Sebastian Blanco. Varela joined on a season-long loan from Porto but Parma are willing to take up the remainder, while San Lorenzo of Argentina want Blanco.
