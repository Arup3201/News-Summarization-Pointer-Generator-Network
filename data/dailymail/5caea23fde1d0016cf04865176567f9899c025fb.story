Hearst is the granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst and gained great notoriety in 1974 when she was kidnapped by the radical group the Symbionese Liberation Army.

Infamous heiress Patty Hearst is back in the news after a dog she co-owns won its group at the Westminster Kennel Club show. The photo on the left was released by the FBI in 1974 when she was kidnapped by the radical group the Symbionese Liberation Army

She was seen holding a machine gun while robbing a California bank, and later spent almost two years in prison.

During her trial, Ms Hearst's lawyers argued that she had been brainwashed by the kidnappers, which has led to her being regarded as a victim of Stockholm Syndrome. 

Her sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. President Bill Clinton gave her a full pardon.

Hurst was abducted on February 4, 1974 from her apartment in Benvenue Street in Berkleley, California. 

The group of heavily armed men and women grabbed Hurst and bundled her into the boot of a car by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. 

The gang was lead by Donald DeFreeze and wanted to overthrow capitalism. 

Following her abduction, the SLA released several communiques demanding millions of dollars worth of food donations in return for her safe release. 

The terrorists used the time to brainwash the then 19-year-old Hearst and locked her in a cupboard.

In April 1974, the SLA released a message from Hearst claiming she had joined the revolution and was seeking to overthrow capitalism. Less than two weeks later she was seen on surveillance footage in a bank brandishing a semi-automatic assault rifle, 

On May 16, two members of the SLA tried to steal an ammunition belt from a Los Angeles shop and were forced to abandon their getaway van. 

The FBI were able to link the van to an SLA safehouse and raided the property the following morning. 

Six members of the SLA, including DeFreeze were killed during the shoot out. The house caught fire. 

Hearst escaped from the scene but was eventually captured in San Francisco on September 18, 1975. 

Her defence team tried to convince the jury that she had been brainwashed and abused by the terrorist organisation. 

She was jailed for seven years after her conviction, but was released within two years.

'People move on,' she said, smiling at Rocket. 'I guess people somehow imagine you don't evolve in your life. I have grown daughters and grand-daughters and other things that normal people have.'

She also has appeared in films including Cry-Baby and Serial Mom. She's done television roles and charitable work.

Hearst has been involved in the dog show world for more than 10 years. She said many are surprised to find out she's moved on to play with pooches.

Hearst, who turns 61 on Friday, is one of Rocket's three co-owners. She's mostly worked with French bulldogs and one of them won an award ribbon earlier in the day.

Hearst's dog will be one of seven in the championship ring on Tuesday night when best in show is chosen. That will cause her to do some shifting — she didn't originally have tickets for the finals.

Even though Hearst loves dogs, her two daughters own cats.

'I don't know what I did wrong,' she said.

Hearst's feather William Randolph Hearst was a newspaper magnate who was widely considered to have been the inspiration for the megalomaniac central character in Citizen Kane.

Hearst has appeared in films including Serial Mom, the 1994 John Walters' movie staring Kathleen Turner

Following her release from prison, Patty married her bodyguard, Bernard Shaw. He died aged 68 in 2013

Her extraordinary tale has spawned countless books and movies, including the 1988 film Patty Hearst, based on her autobiography and starring Natasha Richardson.

Following her release from prison, Patty married her bodyguard, Bernard Shaw. He died aged 68 in 2013. 

The couple had two daughters, Gillian and Lydia, a model and actress who has appeared on the cover of glossy magazines such as Vogue.
