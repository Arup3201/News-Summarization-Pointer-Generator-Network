An artist gives dead butterflies a new lease of life by building them wings out of gold, cloth and plant roots.

Anne ten Donkelaar, who says her work is inspired by objects she finds in nature, built up a collection of dead butterflies with a variety of injuries to their wings.

She then rebuilt any missing parts using unusual materials to give them a 'second life'.

Labour of love: An artist gives dead butterflies a new lease of life by building them wings out of gold, cloth and plant roots

Dedication: Anne ten Donkelaar, who says her work is inspired by objects she finds in nature, built up a collection of dead butterflies with a variety of injuries to their wings

Work of art: 'By protecting these precious pieces under glass, I give the objects a second life and hope to inspire people to make up their own stories about them,' said Ms ten Donkelaar

Ms ten Donkelaar, 32, who lives in Amsterdam, says she came up with the idea after reading The Butterfly Workshop by Gioconda Belli.

On her website, she said: 'This children’s book is about a character called Arno, one of the ‘designers of all things’ who secretly wants to create something that is as beautiful as a flower and can fly like a bird.

'Arno works in a space where butterflies are designed and made, and this idea of a utilitarian workspace for beautiful creatures really appealed to my imagination.

'I had my own collection of damaged butterflies, so I decided to repair each one differently according to their needs. So in a way, I now have my own workplace with butterflies and give the butterflies a second life.

Artist at work: Anne ten Donkelaar

'I design body parts and give the insects new names, names that reveal something about their recovery.

'For example the The 'Blauw spinner' looked like it had died the moment it hatched from its cocoon. This lead me to me make the body from a twig wrapped with blue thread.'

A few threads are still hanging loose, almost as though the butterfly is slowly unwinding and breaking free from its cocoon.'

Ms
ten Donkelaar, who graduated from the Utrecht school of The Art in 
2007, also creates stunning artwork using other insects such as bees and
parts of flowers and trees.

She said: 'A damaged butterfly, a broken twig, a bumblebee, some strangely grown weeds: find all these unique discoveries in my path and then take them home to my studio.

'I
take my time to explore the objects and try to work out how I can show 
each one to it's best advantage. My finds inspire me. While looking at 
them I can invent my own stories about their existence and their lives.

'By
protecting these precious pieces under glass, I give the objects a 
second life and hope to inspire people to make up their own stories 
about them.'
