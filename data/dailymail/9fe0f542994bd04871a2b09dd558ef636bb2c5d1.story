Former House of Representatives Speaker Peter Slipper, pictured arriving at the Magistrates Court in Canberra last week, has been found guilty of dishonesty

Former parliamentary Speaker Peter Slipper has been found guilty of dishonestly using taxpayer-funded travel vouchers.

Mr Slipper had admitted using commonwealth Cabcharge taxi vouchers to pay for trips to wineries outside Canberra in January 2010.

But the former MP denied he acted dishonestly.

The ACT Chief Magistrate Lorraine Walker thought otherwise after a week-long hearing, finding Mr Slipper guilty of three counts of dishonesty on Monday.

An impassive Mr Slipper sipped from a glass of water as the verdict was delivered and he will be sentenced on September 22.

Mr Slipper's lawyers indicated more evidence might be presented to the court prior to sentencing.

During the trial Slipper's lawyer's told the magistrate that it wasn't unusual for him to keep a tab of daily travel and use manual dockets to pay for trips.

The former Queensland Nationals and Liberal MP was charged with misusing about $900 worth of Cabcharge vouchers on three separate occasions in the first half of 2010.

The prosecution had alleged Slipper manually filled out multiple vouchers for the journeys to hide the non-parliamentary nature of the trips - one of which involved several stops at wineries over 4.5 hours.

His defence team claimed it wasn't unusual for Slipper to pay for trips at the end of daily travel and pay for them manually instead of electronically.

After lengthy legal argument during his trial in the ACT Magistrate's Court last Wednesday, Slipper's defence was allowed to submit some new evidence to prove his tendency to do so but not all their evidence was allowed.

Slipper admitted hiring the cars and paying with multiple, manual dockets.

On at least one occasion Slipper had attended a parliamentary function as part of the travel, the court was told.

Detective Sergeant Michael Turner - who was in charge of the investigation - told the court several other car trips were investigated but no charges were laid.

In June, Slipper's lawyers argued the charges should be dismissed under the Mental Health Act due to his state of mind.

The court was told that his life had spiralled into one of despair as a result of criminal allegations but it ruled the trial go ahead for the sake of public interest.

MPs and senators are allowed only to use government funds to pay for official or parliamentary travel.
