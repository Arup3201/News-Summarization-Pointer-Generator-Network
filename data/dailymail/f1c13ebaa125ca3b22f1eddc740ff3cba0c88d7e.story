A White House spokesman says officials were in touch with the Jimmy Kimmel show over President Obama appearing, but turned the opportunity down because of crises in Gaza and Ukraine

The White House has confirmed that it was in touch with the Jimmy Kimmel Live show over President Obama appearing, but decided not to go ahead with the segment after crises in both Gaza and Ukraine.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama had considered appearing on the show during his West Coast trip this week, but had turned the opportunity down.

Earnest added that the decision was 'at least in part' to do with the rapidly worsening crises in Gaza and Ukraine.

Asked whether officials had decided that appearing on the light-hearted show would be a bad idea, Earnest simply replied 'we elected not to do it.'Â 

Appearing on the Kimmel show would have caused controversy for Obama, who has already been criticised for attending a large number of fundraisers during his trip despite tragedies overseas.

The President is due to be in LA this evening, when the show is filmed, sparking rumours that he would make a guest appearance.

TV Guide shows that on Wednesday, Kimmel has a performance from Common scheduled, but no other guests are listed.

Having already appeared on TV with the likes of David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon, it was thought that Obama would feature in an hour slot on Kimmel's show.

In their statement today, the While House sought to play down talks with ABC executives about Obama's appearance, but according to TMZ scheduling for the show was so advanced that officials had started to run background checks on all staff at the El Capitan theatre where the show is filmed.

Obama has already been criticised for attending multiple fundraising events while on his visit to the West Coast, including for Democratic candidates in Seattle and San Fransisco on Tuesday before arriving in Los Angeles today.

He will spend the day attend local Democratic National Committee events scheduled for tonight and tomorrow, when he will also appear Thursday at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College.

Yesterday, fans of the Kimmel show took to Twitter to discuss the news and some mocked Obama.

User Jonah Goldberg saying 'Unforeseen fundraiser get in the way?' and Jeannie Bondie adding: 'So just fundraisers, then?'.

Today in Gaza, Hamas has been accused of hiding rockets in an empty school next to makeshift housing for 3,000 displaced Palestinians, effectively making them human shields.

With the invasion now nearly a week old, the death toll for Palestinians has reached 630, including many children.

Meanwhile in Ukraine, the bodies of those killed when Flight MH17 was shot down last week are being transported out of the country for identification, following accusations that pro-Russian separatists had plundered the crash site.

Having previously appeared on TV with the likes of David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon, Obama's trip to LA sparked speculation he could be about to appear with Jimmy Kimmel (pictured)
