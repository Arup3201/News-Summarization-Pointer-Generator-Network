A police officer in Ferguson allowed his dog to urinate on a makeshift memorial for Michael Brown just hours after the teen was gunned down, a new report has claimed.

According to Mother Jones, police also drove their patrol cars over the flowers and candles Brown's mother had scattered over the place her son's body fell and laid for more than four hours, crushing them.

Reporter Mark Follman says he corroborated the shocking claims with three separate state and local officials who worked with the community in the immediate aftermath of the August 9 shooting.

Memorial: A police officer allegedly allowed a dog to pee on a makeshift memorial on the spot Michael Brown was killed, pictured here on Sunday August 10 before it was then crushed

He said one of the officials interviewed an eyewitness and pressed the young woman to describe exactly what she saw.

'She said that the officer just let the dog pee on it,' he said the official told him. 

'She was very distraught about it.'

It's not clear who the officer controlling the dog was or which agency he worked for, according to the report.

Missouri state Representative Sharon Pace, whose district includes the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, told Mother Jones that she brought tea light candles for the family the day after Brown's death.

She said they scattered the candles and some rose petals on the ground where Brown had died at around 7 p.m.

'They spelled out his initials with rose petals over the bloodstains,' Pace recalled of the teen's mother Lesley McSpadden and other family.

McSpadden had earlier been blocked by police from approaching his body.

But soon the flowers and candles had been smashed by officers who had blocked off the street to cars other than law enforcement vehicles .

'That made people in the crowd mad and it made me mad,' Pace told the publication, and she added that residents began walking in front of police vehicles to prevent them from driving into the block.

A picture taken after the incident and posted on Twitter by Alderman of the 21st Ward of St. Louis Antonio French shows the destroyed memorial, with the caption 'Police cars trampled the rose petals and candles at the memorial for #MikeBrown.'

He also tweeted video of the angry police dogs.

The St. Louis County Police said the department was unaware of the incidents.

But, if true, they no doubt fueled the violent conflict in Ferguson that rumbled on for two weeks following Brown's shooting.
