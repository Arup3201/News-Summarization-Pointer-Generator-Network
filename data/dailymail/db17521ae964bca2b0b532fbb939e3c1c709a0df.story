UEFA says Greek referee Tasos Sidiropoulos did not show a yellow card to the wrong CSKA Moscow player in Wednesday's Champions League game against Manchester City.

Reports of CSKA's 2-1 win suggested Sidiropoulos should have sent off Pontus Wernbloom by showing the Sweden defender a second yellow card for his 77th-minute foul on City forward Sergio Aguero.

Instead, Sergei Ignashevich was booked in what was widely reported - including by Man City's official website - as a case of mistaken identity.

UEFA says Sidiropoulos explained in his written match report that Ignashevich was given a yellow card for dissent, and he did not think Wernbloom's foul merited a second yellow.

The referee, in his first season at Champions League group-stage level, also sent off two Man City players.
