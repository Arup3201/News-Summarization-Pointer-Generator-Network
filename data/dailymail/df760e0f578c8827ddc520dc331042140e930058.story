A shocked mother was confronted by this pair of black beady eyes after she opened a can of tuna.

Zoe Butler made the grim discovery of the mystery purple sea creature as she prepared to tuck into Princes fish chunks.  

'I opened the top of the lid and saw a purple thing, a gut sack or intestine - then I turned it round and pushed it with a fork and saw it looking back at me,' said the 28-year-old.

'It's got like a spiny tail along the bottom - it's quite grim. I dropped the fork, jumped back, screamed a bit and shouted for my nan to come and have a look.'

Tin monster: This is the mystery sea creature that Zoe Butler found in the can of Princes tuna

The shocked mother-of-two screamed and shouted after making the grim discovery

The mother-of-two had bought the tinned fish, preserved in spring water, as part of a multi-pack from Asda in Arnold, Nottingham.

The clerical officer, sent a photo of the fishy find to Princes who have apologised and launched an investigation. 

'I haven't shown it to the kids because they might get put off eating tuna. I just want to find out what it is and to make sure it doesn't happen to somebody else,' said Ms Butler.

'I didn't set out to get compensation and I don't a want lifetime's supply of tuna'

Her grandmother Susan Goddard, 69, said: 'It's a little red and has eyes, bright black, looking at you. We did manage to ascertain that it was dead.'

Dr Hany Elsheikha, associate professor of veterinary parasitology at the University of Nottingham, said it could be some form of juvenile crab.

He said: 'All I can see from the picture is a body and the eyes are very prominent. The legs have been chopped off during the process.'

A spokesman for Princes said: 'We were contacted by Mrs Butler and immediately responded to apologise. We are arranging for her to send us the product so that we can look into this matter fully.'

An Asda spokeswoman said they were awaiting the outcome of the investigation.
