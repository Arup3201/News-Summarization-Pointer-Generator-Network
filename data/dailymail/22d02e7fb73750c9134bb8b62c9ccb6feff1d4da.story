An assistant school principal has been removed from his post after exchanging almost 3,000 text messages and copious late night phone calls with a pupil.

Christian Del Re, 32, has been accused of 'inappropriate contact' with an 18-year-old girl at Leon M. Goldstein High School for Sciences in Brooklyn, New York.

Both Del Re, who married his high school sweet heart Gina in 2005, and the girl have denied that their relationship went beyond texting and talking.

'Inappropriate': Christian Del Re, an assistant principal and an 18-year-old pupil exchanged some 3,000 text messages and several late-night phone calls

But a pupil claimed they saw Del Re 
playing with the girl’s hair on one occasion. He is also said to have 
been seen driving the girl from the school’s parking lot in his car.

Investigators found that Del Re had texted the girl 1,442 times between November 2011 and January this year while she texted him 1,477 times. That is an average of 1.3 text messages per hour between them for 91 days.

Numerous phone calls were also made after midnight and ranged from 49 to 163 minutes, officials said. On at least two occasions he called her at about 3am.

Del Re claimed he was helping the 
student cope with problems, telling investigators she ‘would talk to him
about problems at school, problems with other students and problems 
with her boyfriend,’ according to a report compiled by Richard Condon, 
the special commissioner of investigation for the New York School 
District.

Denies anything more: Del Re, a married man, and the young woman both deny that the relationship went beyond texting and talking after another pupil claimed they saw Del Re playing with the girl's hair

Miss him: One student said Del Re, pictured with the principal Joseph Zaza and pupils at the school in 2009, was a 'good man' and 'always very involved with the school'

‘Del Re said that he never touched’ the student, according to Condon’s report.

He turned over three letters of recommendation he wrote to help the pupil gain a college place and get a job, in an attempt to clear his name.

Del Re did, however, admit to driving the young woman to the train station three times and said the phone calls were made so late because he got home from work late.

According to the NY Daily News,
Education Department spokeswoman Connie Pankratz said: ‘We are moving 
forward with disciplinary charges against Christian Del Re and will be 
seeking his termination.

Removed: Del Re has been removed from his post at Leon M. Goldstein High School for Sciences (pictured) and the education department are preparing 'disciplinary charges' against him

‘He has been reassigned and is no longer at the school.’

Senior pupil Carolin Guarrella said of Del Re: ‘He’s a good man and he was always very involved with the school and very helpful. He knew how to offer students advice.

‘There could be 3,000 text messages, but it doesn’t mean there was anything sexual. I don’t believe it.’

Student Kevin Guerara, 17, said he missed having Del Re at school.

He said: 'He doesn’t deserve this. It’s all just rumours.

'The woman who accused him just wanted attention.’

Gave advice: Del Re claims he was simply giving the pupil advice to cope with her problems and that calls made late at night were done so because he was late getting to his Staten Island home (pictured) after work
