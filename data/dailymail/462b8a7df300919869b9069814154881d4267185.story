John Edwards has been caught on camera with the new woman in his life as he is said to have ended things once again with the mistress who ruined his political career.

The disgraced former Senator has reportedly been dating a single mother nearly half his age for about a year and the woman has gotten close with his family.

The National Enquirer reported that Danielle King was spotted going on a date to a local Italian restaurant with Edwards after first meeting at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

John Edwards and his alleged new girlfriend Danielle King were spotted on October 18 going to an Italian restaurant near his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina

The couple arrived separately at the restaurant and kept a distance from each other when they left. However while inside, their closeness was evident to other diners.

'They were very smiley and absolutely 
engrossed in conversation. They gazed into each other's eyes as if they 
were the only two people on the planet,' an unidentified source told the
 tabloid magazine of their meal at Panzanella.

The 35-year-old single mom has become a fixture at Edwards' home that he shares with his young children.

The
 60-year-old dad is now tasked with raising his teenage children Emma 
Claire, 15, and Jack, 13, following his wife Elizabeth's death to cancer
 in 2010.

Now Ms King, who 
has a son of her own, has become a maternal figure in the Edwards home, 
as the tabloid reports that she has watched the children when 'Johnny' 
has had to go out of town.

New couple: Former Senator John Edwards. 60, was seen going to a romantic Italian restaurant with Danielle King, 35, and they have reportedly been seeing each other for about a year

Ms King and her son Austin have reportedly been embraced by Edwards' teenage children Jack and Emma Claire

She and her son Austin have apparently
 been embraced by Edwards' children as The National Enquirer reports that Jack 
chose to write a school essay about her and called her his 'hero' in a 
Facebook post.

Ms King, who
 works at Duke University's Cancer Care Research Program as a clinical 
coordinator, returned the favor by posting a picture of her and Jack on 
her own profile when it was his birthday. 

'Happy Birthday, Bud. I love you so so so
 so so much. Thank you for being you and making my world, and everyone 
else's, a better place,' she wrote as the photo caption.

The other women: Edwards has reportedly called off his relationship with his former mistress Rielle Hunter, with whom he had his daughter Quinn

King's presence marks a new period in the Democrat's romantic life as he has apparently ended things with his former mistress Rielle Hunter once and for all.

He reportedly first arranged for Hunter and their daughter Quinn - whose conception and birth during the 2008 presidential race thwarted his hopes of being his party's nominee - to live in a separate house near his family's home in Chapel Hill.

Then the year after Elizabeth died, The Enquirer reports that he allowed Hunter and Quinn to move into his family's home alongside Emma, Claire and Jack.

For a period, the relationship between Hunter and Edwards seemed to be back on track as they spent weekends at his beach house in the resort locale of Figure Eight Island.

Now it seems she has been replaced as Ms King is now the one accompanying Edwards and his children on trips to his beach house.

Hunter reportedly had a falling out with Edwards after she made the decision to publish a book about the affair.

He allegedly kicked her out of the home and she has since done an about-face, writing a mea culpa for The Huffington Post.

'Instead of apologizing when I should have, I went on to hurt more people by writing a book,' Hunter wrote months after its publication.

'I truly did not realize at that time how damaged I was and because of that, when I wrote my book I made more mistakes, ones I feel horrible about.'
