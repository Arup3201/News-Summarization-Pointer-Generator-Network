It sounds like a boss' dream: pen toppers that double up as cutlery meaning a worker never has to leave their desk at lunchtime again.

The Dine Ink Pen Utensil Set is made of plastic and includes a fork, spoon and knife topper.

They can each be slotted onto the end of any standard ballpoint pen, meaning the pen can be used in the traditional way before being flipped over and becoming a utensil.

The Dine Ink Utensil Set, pictured left, are pen toppers that double up as a full range of cutlery, designed to make eating at a desk, pictured right, much easier

First there was the spork, or the spoon-and-fork - and now there's another piece of cutlery that could save on the washing up.

The device, dubbed the ‘Knork’, combines the four prongs of a fork with the sharp edge of a knife.

Made
of stainless steel, it has been designed with very slight curved edges,
so the bladed section will not easily cut someone reaching into the 
cutlery drawer, or even worse, cut their tongue while they are eating.

The desk cutlery set is available from the Fred and Friends store on Amazon and a set of three toppers, with pens, costs $8.49 (£5.49).

Its description said: 'Ever found yourself sitting at your desk all set to eat lunch and realize you have no utensils to use? Then you are in desperate need of the Dine Ink Pen Utensil Set.

'Each one of these cool pens has a cap with a cool and convenient eating utensil built right in to it.

'A fork, a spoon and a knife are at your fingertips, ready to use at a moment's notice.'

The makers continue 'Our Dine Ink Utensil Set is pencap 
cutlery for the cubicle captive.

'You decided to take the stairs down to 
the office cafeteria, got your tray and ordered your food, decided to 
take the elevator back up to your cube, and as you sit down your 
discover you forgot utensils.

Customer reviews claim that the lightweight plastic toppers, pictured, which weigh around 59g each, are 'sturdy and well made' with no sharp edges. It adds that the toppers can also stand up to the 'heaviest fork- or spoonful'
Once they have been used, the topped can be removed and washed. Each topper is seven inches long, half an inch tall and an inch wide.
