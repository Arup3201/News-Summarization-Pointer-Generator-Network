It is a view which is bound to make any sports fan set the countdown clock for 2016.

These are the first images showing what we can expect from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in just under three years’ time.

Built on a waterfront peninsula in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of the city, it stretches out over 300 acres and will help Rio host 15 Olympic sports and 11 Paralympic competitions at 34 venues across the city.

Let the games begin: As well as the sports parks and venues, the Rio de Janeiro Olympic park will also feature a 12,000 capacity waterfront lawn where sports fans can watch the games on big screens

Bright lights, big city: The triangular peninsula will be lit up in the colour of the Olympic flag at night, according to this prediction by designers

Resourceful design: The peninsula upon hosted the 2007 Pan-American Games at three venues which will now be incorporated into the new Olympic Park

The 2016 Olympic Park has been designed by the same architects who created the now iconic London 2012 Park, located in Stratford, East London.

London-based International Architects Studio Aecom won the bid in 2011, basing their design on classic Brazilian architecture and nature, with the aim to create a legacy for the city.

The
 15 venues will be interconnected by flowing pathways, intended to 
remind the great Amazon River, and for those who fail to get their hands
 on the much-coveted tickets, a waterfront open green space is to be 
built to host 12,000 people who will be able to follow the actions on 
big screens.

A specific 
broadcast centre will play host to 20,000 journalists from around the 
world, and the Olympic villages will be located nearby.

Architects
 say the construction of the Rio Olympic Park is set to be much more 
straight forward than the 2012 Games, as several venues are already 
operating.

Paved with good intentions: What the park will look like in 2016, during the Olympic Games

Olympic legacy: Once the Games are over the Olympic site, pictured as planned in 2018, will begin a conversion from mammoth sports Mecca to a resourceful addition to the city

Complete conversion: The image shows the site plan for 2013, with many of the venues converted into housing and schools, much needed in Rio

Unlike the London Games, the main Olympic stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous Brazil football stadium, the Maracana, which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the Joco Havelange Stadium - home to the club side Botafogo.

The Olympic Park itself is centered around three original sports venues which were built for the 2007 Pan-American Games.

The
 vision for the future is not just to create a global stage for the 
Olympic and Paralympic Games of 2016, but also, in the longer term, to 
create a new legacy district with new homes, jobs and places for leisure
 activities,’ Aecom said.

'Every
 Olympics needs to reflect the character and ambitions of the host city 
and this is where the differences between the two parks are most 
pronounced.

‘While London 
was about demonstrating how a short global event can lead to the long 
term regeneration of one of the most neglected and deprived areas of the
 city, Rio is about celebrating Brazil's emergence as a world power as 
well as making sure there is a strong legacy plan in place.'

Good track record: The London architecture firm which was chosen to design the Rio site, was also responsible for creating the 2012 Olympic park in Stratford

Lighting up the world: Rio's Olympic Park will be located next to the water's edge in the Barra area of the the city, built on the former Brazilian grand prix track
