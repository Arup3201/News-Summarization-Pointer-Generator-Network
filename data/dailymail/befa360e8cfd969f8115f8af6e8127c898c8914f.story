England are set to fast-track Liverpool starlet Jordon Ibe in to the senior set-up to keep him from Nigeria's clutches.

The 19-year-old has burst onto scene in recent weeks following a string of impressive displays for the Merseysiders since returning from a loan spell at Derby.

Ibe has represented England for the Under 18s, Under 19s and Under 20s and is now set for a call up into Gareth Southgate's Under 21 set-up.

However, Ibe is eligible to play for Nigeria through his father and the Super Eagles have begun the process of trying to convince the teenager to turn his back on England.

Despite playing for England at junior level, Ibe is eligible to play for Nigeria until he plays a competitive international for the senior side.

Nigeria's interest has not gone unnoticed by the England set-up, who are eager not to lose Ibe.

The youngster also had a successful spell at Derby before Brendan Rodgers recalled him last month

And the FA will consider fast-tracking Ibe into the senior set-up in the coming months in an attempt to convince him his international future remains with England, particularly if he continues in his rich vein of form.

Roy Hodgson is unlikely to give Ibe a call up for the March internationals against Lithuania and Italy.

But the clashes against the Republic of Ireland and Slovenia in June could see Ibe drafted in to the senior set-up provided he maintains his performance level.
