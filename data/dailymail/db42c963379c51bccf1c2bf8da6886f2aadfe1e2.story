With soft, fluffy manes, soulful eyes and tiny size, they look like something out of a fairy tale - and are cute enough to brighten anyone's day.

But these adorable miniature horses had one mission: to put a smile on the faces of sick children at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center.

Mystery and Lunar trotted into the hospital's pediatric unit last month to the delight of wide-eyed youngsters, some hooked up to IV poles, who stepped out into the corridors for a closer look.

And those too sick to leave their beds weren't left out when the long-lashed little creatures came over for a spot of bedside nuzzling.

The horses are about the size big dogs, and their roles involve offering comfort care and distraction therapy for patients. 

The role is often taken on by dogs in health-care settings, but mini-horses add an extra element of delight as many children don't know they exist outside of fairy tales.

Animal therapy, according to studies and anecdotal reports, may benefit health, perhaps even speeding healing and recovery.

Stroking Mystery's nose from her propped-up hospital bed, 14-year-old Elizabeth Duncan said: 'I want one.'

And epilepsy patient Emily Pietsch, 17, after gently tracing Lunar's heart-shaped muzzle with her fingers, added: 'They're so nice and they don't judge and they're so sweet.' 

These two horses belong to animal-assisted therapy group Mane in Heaven, based in Lake in the Hills, northeast of Chicago.

They have visited nursing homes and centers for the disabled, but this visit was their first ever inside a hospital. It was also the first horse-therapy visit for the hospital, and more are planned.

Fairy tale: 'They're so nice and they don't judge and they're so sweet,' said epilepsy patient Emily Pietsch 

Robyn Hart, the hospital's director of child life services, said: 'We have long had animal-assisted therapy here at Rush and just seen the enormous benefits that animals can have on most children — just the joy that they bring, the unconditional love.'

He added mini-horses 'are something that most people whether kids or adults have never seen before, and so that builds in a little more excitement and anticipation. 

'They almost look like mythical animals, like they should have wings on,' she added.

The horses were 'a smashing success. We're looking forward to having them visit monthly.' 

Some people confuse these horses with better-known Shetland ponies, but minis are less stout, with a more horse-like build.  

Mane in Heaven's owner, Jodie Siegel, a former obstetrics nurse, says the minis bring 'smiles, joy, love and laughter and that's the true healing in action.'

Some research has suggested that animal-assisted therapy may reduce pain and blood pressure, and decrease fear and stress in hospitalized children. But much of it is based on patients' reports.

A review of 10 years of studies about in-patient therapy using dogs, published in April in the Southern Medical Association's journal, concluded that it's safe and can be effective.

Accident: Horse helpers carry hand sanitizer and pooper scoopers in case of accidents on therapy visits

Dr. Caroline Burton of Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, a co-author of the review, owns seven dogs, four regular horses and a donkey, and strongly supports animal-assisted therapy.

She acknowledged that skeptics dismiss it as 'touchy-feely' and lacking hard evidence of any meaningful medical benefits. 

Dr Burton said studies are needed on whether animals in hospitals can shorten patients' stays and reduce readmission rates — something her hospital is looking into with dogs and heart failure patients.

While some worry about animals bringing germs into hospitals, Burton's review found no associated infections in patients.

Guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that animal-assisted therapy in health-care settings stems from evidence that having pets at home helps some patients recover more quickly from medical procedures. 

The guidelines focus mostly on infection control procedures and hand-washing for patients and hospital staff.

Ms Siegel, Mane in Heaven's owner, and her horse helpers carry lots of hand sanitizer and a pooper scooper on therapy visits. 

She doesn't feed the horses beforehand, to help avoid accidents. Even so, one of the horses pooped in a hallway during the Chicago hospital visit, but the volunteers cleaned up in a flash and no one seemed phased.
