ISIS militants fighting in Iraq and Syria have greeted the death of Hollywood actor Robin Williams with bizarre Twitter outbursts declaring their love for his 1995 film Jumanji.

As news broke of the 63-year-old's death in an apparent suicide, Islamist militants and their supporters took to social media to discuss the merits of Williams' long career in the film industry.

The expressions of love for his fantasy adventure film Jumanji were tempered somewhat by a number of terrorists condemning the late actor for jokes he made about jihadists during a filmed stand-up performance that has been uploaded on YouTube.

One known Islamist who goes by the name 
Abdullah and uses the Twitter handle @Mujahid4life was quick to voice 
his love of the actor's mid-1990s work. 'Abdullah' is understood to be a 19-year-old British born Islamist and ISIS supporter.

Responding to London-based user Ibn Fulaan, who declared Williams death a 'shame' because he 'liked Jumanji', 'Abdullah' tweeted: 'Good movie. Loved it as a kid.'

Fulaan responded: 'Same, I had it on video lol.'

When
 other Twitter users expressed their disbelief that 'Abdullah' was 
openly discussing his love of Williams' films, another Islamist by the
 name Omar Shishani said: 'We are humans like you, joke about girls 
mirls... why we shouldn't see movie? [Sic]'

The exchange saw the Islamist fighters 
enter into a debate about movies, with 'Abdullah' answering a number of 
questions on his all-time favourite films.

Asked
 by one Twitter user what his favourite Star Wars film was, he replied: 'I 
like Empire Strikes Back most,' before admitting he could 'maybe' see 
parallels between the film's rebels forces and ISIS.

Warning: ISIS fighters have expressed a desire to expand its territory to include stretches of Europe, including Rome and Madrid, and have also threatened to raise the jihadist flag over Downing Street and the White House

Bizarre: The Islamist fighters entered into a debate about movies, with Abdullah answering a number of questions on his all-time favourite films - many of which are Disney movies from the 1990s

The hugely popular television series Games of Thrones did not get his seal of approval, however, with the 19-year-old admitting he had only managed to get through two episodes before switching it off

Off-message: Abdullah did, however, express his concern that his radical Islamist message may have been lost somewhat while discussing Disney films

Discussing his views on Steven Spielberg's blockbuster Schindler's List, 'Abdullah' replied: 'It was ok, but i think i only watched like half of it, been a while, can't remember. i like Spielberg flicks tho.'

When quizzed on his love of 90s children's' movies, the 'Abdullah' said he preferred Lion King to Bambi but admitted: 'honestly i like all the disney renaissance flicks.'

The hugely popular television series 
Games of Thrones did not get his seal of approval, however, with the 
19-year-old admitting he had only managed to get through two episodes 
before switching it off as it contained 'too much nudity.'

After receiving a number of shocked tweets asking why he was so interested in Western films and television, the ISIS supporter sent a message to a follower saying: 'They think i grew up 
somewhere in a mud hut so i never saw a movie whereas i've seen most of 
the flicks they ask. lol.'

'Abdullah' did, however, express concern that his radical Islamist message may
 have been lost somewhat while discussing Disney films, saying: 'Now I'm
 actually worried that people will start to follow me because they wanna
 hear about my favorite movies instead of reporting jihad.'

Disbelief: Abdullah gained a huge amount of social media attention after voicing his love of Robin Williams' mid-1990s work

After receiving a number of shocked messages asking why he was so interested in Western films, the ISIS jihadist sent a message saying: 'They think i grew up somewhere in a mud hut'

Change of mind: Having earlier declared himself to be a fan of Jumanji, Abdullah later attacked Robin Williams after video emerged of him mocking jihadists during a stand-up performance

Having earlier declared himself to be a fan of Jumanji, 'Abdullah' appeared to change his mind a short time later after other ISIS militants posted YouTube footage of Williams mocking jihadists during a stand-up performance.

In the clip
 Williams jokes that the oft-repeated claim that Islamic martyrs receive
 '71 dark-haired virgins' may have been misinterpreted, and they are in 
fact given '72 crystal clear raisins'.

He
 also jokes about the late Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden being beaten 
at the gates of heaven by the first president of the U.S. George 
Washington and 71 Virginians.

The
 video prompted 'Abdullah' to share the clip with his followers, saying: 
'Those that say "RIP" to #RobinWilliams check out what he had to say 
about Islam...May Allah make him burn.'

He
 also mocked claims Williams committed suicide, describing it as a 
'blessing' and claiming 'Allah guards us from depression. Hell, what an 
evil destination.'

Another Twitter user who goes my the name @AbuHamza1948 and usually posts in Arabic script added: 'he...crossed dressed for a living and defames our religion may Allah give him what he deserves in the Akhira [afterlife].'

ISIS militants fighting in Iraq and 
Syria have reportedly issued Islamic State passports as part of their 
'psychological warfare' campaign.

Following
 their attempt to form a caliphate in the vast area of the Middle East 
under their control, ISIS leaders are said to be introducing passports 
to give the unrecognised state an air of legitimacy.

However
 experts believe the sinister black and white design,
 which is based on the black jihadist flag flown by ISIS terrorists and 
warns of a 'deployment of armies' if the holder comes to harm while 
travelling abroad, proved the passports are little more than a symbolic 
gesture.

Authentic? ISIS militants have reportedly issued these Islamic State passports in the hope they will give the unrecognised state an air of legitimacy. The documents are said to have been issued to 11,000 people

While ISIS has expressed a 
desire to expand its territory to include stretches of Europe, including
 Rome and Madrid, and have also threatened to raise the jihadist flag 
over Downing Street and the White House, the issuing of passports is 
more about sending a message than transporting fighters.

Issuing
 state documents is both a clear indication that ISIS considers its 
declared caliphate to be the world's newest state, and also to shrug off
 the threat posed to its existence by U.S. airstrikes.

So far at least two versions of the alleged passport have emerged online.

Although
 it is not possible to prove the authenticity of either version, the 
latter has been widely shared on social media by respected terror 
experts and academics.

Dr 
Magnus Ranstorp, a Swedish academic who regularly briefs senior 
government and security officials on the threat of Islamic terrorism, 
tweeted a photograph of the plastic passport along with the caption: 
'Illusions of a Caliphate. ISIS issue passports as part of psychological
 warfare.'
