Inspired by the death of her only son, a former medical secretary spent countless painstaking hours and thousands of dollars to recreate Princess Diana's iconic wedding dress.

Julie Oliver, 49, from Port Macquarie in northern New South Wales, was inspired to drop her career and take up a four-year course in fashion design after her disabled son Haydon died in 2010 at the age of 16.

'He had an epileptic seizure and a heart attack and I thought life was too short and I wanted to do something I'd always wanted to do – I realised that there was so much more to life,' Ms Oliver told Daily Mail Australia.

The final product (pictured on model Alison) has more than 13 metres of ivory taffeta, at least 16 metres of tulle, over eight metres of English bridal net, thousands of metres of lace and hundreds of beads

Princess Diana's original 1981 wedding dress was  created by British designers Elizabeth and David Emanuel

Her life dream, to recreate the much loved Princess Diana's 1981 wedding dress, meant sewing more than 13 metres of ivory taffeta, at least 16 metres of tulle, over eight metres of English bridal net, thousands of metres of lace and hundreds of beads into a replica dress.

The result is a flamboyant and elegant dress which looks almost entirely identical to the one created by British designers Elizabeth and David Emanuel for Princess Diana.

Diana's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, inherited their mother's lace and ivory silk wedding dress earlier this year.

The recreation did not come without painstaking effort and some heartrending moments for the mother-of-two.

'You just couldn't get the lace the right colour..so I had to dye them with a coffee bag,' Ms Oliver said

Ms Oliver, whose love for the royals was encouraged by her parents, described how she worked on sections of the dress alongside her mother

Ms Oliver, whose love for the royals was encouraged by her parents, described how she lost her mother and father in October this year.

The former medical secretary was inspired to drop her career and take up a course in fashion design after her disabled 16-year-old son Haydon died in 2010

'My mother was a dress maker, she taught me to do embroidery when I was young whilst sitting by the fire; my mother made all our clothes when we were growing up,' Ms Oliver said.

'She got cancer and we didn't even realise she had it and we went to say goodbye to her at the hospital and that night my dad died because he didn't want to live without her.

'I'd been sewing the bodice panel with her – she didn't get too see it finished.'

She said that her parents had first met on a train coming back from Melbourne where the queen had been visiting. Seeing Duchess Kate Middleton's wedding dress in 2011 prompted her mother to reminisce about seeing Diana’s magical wedding at the age of 16. 

The mother-of-two now remains undecided as to what she'll do with the recreated dress, admitting that the 'labour of love' holds great sentimental value for her.

She described how she spent endless hours in the first half of the year simply studying photos from the world exhibition of the dress, as well as the book released by the designers.

'I spent an awful lot of hours sewing well into the night, hundreds of hours hand sewing the beads on and I still think "I could put a few more on her"',' Ms Oliver said.

'My mother was a dress maker, she taught me to do embroidery when I was young whilst sitting by the fire,' Ms Oliver said of her mother Lorna, pictured with her husband Glen

She described some of the challenges she faced when making the dress. 

'You just couldn't get the lace the right colour either, so I had to die them with a coffee bag – I would hold it in the water for just the right amount of time until I got what I wanted'.

'The bodice and the sleeves: I'm really happy with how they turned out. I'm always going to see that's it's not the same, but it does look very close.

'The fullness of the dress: Princess Diana had about 100 metres of tulle (the net that you pump out around the petticoat) – that's almost impossible to recreate and I gather it's impossible to even walk in.

Ms Oliver is hoping to turn her hobby into a career and and says she is considering making a replica of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress next

'I used 16 metres of tulle that I ruffled and gathered and I couldn't get it to puff out as much. In the end I had to use a hoop petticoat because I couldn't seem to get it big enough.

'I also didn't make the full length train because I realised I'm never going to be able to fit it anywhere – so, it's only about three metres instead of 25 feet.'

Ms Oliver, who now hopes to turn her hobby into a career, she is considering making a replica of Catherine Middleton's, the Duchess of Cambridge, wedding dress next.
