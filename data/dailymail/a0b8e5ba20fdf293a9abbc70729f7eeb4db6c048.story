British Open winner Rory McIlroy has revealed that breaking up with Caroline Wozniacki is the reason behind his recent unstoppable form.

The 25-year-old world number one split from his ex-fiancée at the end of May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations.

Now the multi-millionaire - who is currently in pursuit of his second major title in four weeks - has revealed that what happened was 'for the best in terms of my golf.'

Rory McIlroy, 25, pictured left, has told reporters that his break-up with ex-fiancée Caroline Wozniacki, 23, pictured right, is behind his recent success and was 'for the best' in terms of his golf

The Irish golfer, who is currently competing for his second major title 
in a row after winning the British Open, said he is mentally in 'a far 
better place' since his high-profile break-up with the Danish tennis 
star

The golfer, who has a £12m annual contract with Nike, said: ‘I think what happened has been for 
the best in terms of my golf.

'I’ve put a bit more time 
into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now?

'I go to the golf course, to the 
gym and it’s just my life at the minute. I worked pretty hard before but
 the past couple of months I’ve really just buried myself in my game.

'I've 
practiced hard and I've done all the right things and I'm reaping the 
rewards.'

He added: 'Mentally, I am just in a far better place.'

The Irish golfer, who won the coveted British Open last month, announced he and Wozniacki had split earlier this year because he was not ready for ‘all that marriage entails’.

He said the decision to call off the 
engagement - which came just hours before the start of a major tournament at Wentworth - was both 'mutual and amicable'.

He later said in a statement released through Dublin-based communications consultants that the 'problem is mine'. 

The multi-millionaire announced the break-up just hours before the start
 of the BMW PGA Championship at the Wentworth Club, Surrey, in May - 
which he went on to win

McIlroy and Wozniacki were spotted at a cafe in Sloane Square, London just days before their split earlier this year

Last month,  Wozniacki posted this picture, saying she was 
wearing heels for the first time in three years. Wozniacki was taller 
than McIlroy in heels so often wore flat shoes

At the time, he said it would be difficult
 to concentrate on the tournament on the back of a public break-up.

He told reporters: ‘There is never a good time to end a relationship.

'I’m
 not going to lie, it’s going to be really difficult but when I get 
inside the ropes I’m going to have to try and concentrate on the matter 
in hand.

'Obviously
 (it's) quite a difficult time for Caroline and myself. It was mutual 
and amicable and we both thought it was the best for us, the best for 
both of us.'

The 25-year-old has been on impressive form since the break-up, including winning the Bridgestone Invitational golf tournament earlier this month, left. Wozniacki, right, has had a less successful summer

But days later, McIlroy went on to win the BMW PGA
 Championship at Wentworth.

His form continued and, in July, he won the British Open by a clear margin. He has now claimed the halfway lead at the 96th US PGA Championship.

Speaking to reporters at the halfway stage, he said: 'Golf is the number one priority to me 
and while I'm on this run of form I want to try and keep it going as 
long as possible.

The couple were together for almost three years and were reportedly due to tie the knot in November at the Rockefeller Centre, New York

In a statement after the break-up, McIlroy, pictured with Wozniacki in 2012, said: 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails'

McIlroy, pictured with Wozniacki, said: 'I think what happened has 
been the best in terms of my golf. I mean, what else do I have now?'

'I'm going to keep working hard and try and get even 
better. Hopefully I can do that over the next few years and hopefully 
you'll see golf like this more often from me.

'It
 obviously works pretty well, so I am going to keep doing it.’

After two years together, McIlroy, who is worth an estimated £28million, proposed to Wozniacki in Sydney, Australia, on New Year's Day with a £120,000 diamond ring.

The pair experienced an on/off relationship during their time together, with sources 
close to the couple claiming McIlroy broke it off 
with Wozniacki in April last year.

The pair confirmed they were engaged on New Year's Day by posting a series of pictures on Twitter, featuring her diamond ring

But after the break-up was announced, the tennis player tweeted saying: 'It's a hard time for me right now'. She referred to supporting Liverpool - a subtle reference to her ex-fiancé's love for Manchester United

Ms Wozniacki was said to have tried on wedding dresses before the break-up

They
 eventually confirmed their engagement on New Year’s Day after McIlroy, 
who also won the US Open in 2011 and the U.S. PGA Championship in 2012, 
proposed during a fireworks show on New Year's Eve in Sydney.

According to sources, their wedding was due to take place at the Rockefeller Centre in New York on November 8.

At the 
time of their engagement, Wozniacki, who is worth an estimated £15m, 
posted a picture of the engagement ring on her Twitter account.

She wrote:
 'Happy new year everyone! Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ...I 
said YES!!!!'

McIlroy then shared the same picture and added: 'Happy New Year everyone! I 
have a feeling it's going to be a great year!! My first victory of 2014 
#shesaidyes!!'

But in the statement after their break-up, McIlroy said: 'The problem is mine.

'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails.

'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had.'

Ms Wozniacki, who was born in Denmark to Polish parents, became world number one in 2012 but has yet to win a Grand Slam.

McIlroy suffered a difficult golfing season last year and said he had considered seeing a sports psychologist to help overcome his issues.

He is currently involved in a lengthy legal battle with his former management company in the courts in Dublin over commissions from his lucrative sports sponsorship and endorsement contracts.

The golf star, who has a £12m a year contract with Nike, claims he has paid more than £4m based on unreasonable fee rates much higher than the norm in the sports agency industry.
