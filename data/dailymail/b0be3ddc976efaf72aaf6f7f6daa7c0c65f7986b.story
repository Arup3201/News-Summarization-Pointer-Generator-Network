To all those who remember the days of Cool Britannia and Tony Blair’s hobnobbing with celebrities, it is a party with a very familiar feel.

But tonight’s knees-up for the world of entertainment hosted at the Foreign Office by David Cameron is not, insists Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, simply a repeat of Mr Blair’s much-mocked 1997 reception at Downing Street.

Mr Javid was adamant last night that it was an important event to thank the creative industries for their ‘staggering’ success in boosting the British economy by £71billion a year.

Around 200 guests from the world of arts and entertainment are expected to attend, including Harrison Ford, Helena Bonham Carter and Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes.

Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, who run Working Title Films which made Four Weddings and a Funeral, are attending; as is Lucian Grainge, chairman and chief executive of Universal Music.

Josh Berger, president and managing director of Warner Bros UK, Ireland and Spain and a governor of the British Film Institute is also expected to attend.

Harry Potter star Emma Watson and Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch have been invited.

Actors Dame Helen Mirren and Ralph Fiennes, along with television presenters Clare Balding, Fearne Cotton and Cat Deeley, were tipped to attend.

A select group of around a dozen will then go on to Downing Street for a dinner.

In an article published today on MailOnline, Mr Javid said: ‘It  is not a showbiz party, or an attempt to bask in reflected glory and coolness.

'It’s an opportunity to thank and encourage the sector, underline our support for the industry, and to remind investors that, from Hogwarts to the Tardis, the UK is very much the centre of the creative universe.’

Mr Javid said the Government’s tax breaks were behind the success, as he pledged new policies in the coming weeks to boost the culture industry even further.

In the time it takes you to reads this article, one particular sector of the British economy will generate almost £700,000. 

It’s a sector that directly employs 1.7 million people, exports to almost every country in the world and, even in a time of strong recovery, is growing three times faster than the rest of the economy.

Our creative industries – which include film, TV, theatre, music and video games – are worth a staggering £71 billion each year.

Whether it’s One Direction, Downton Abbey or Moshi Monsters, the UK punches well above its weight, consistently producing the music people want to hear, the programmes they want to see and the games they want to play. 

Even for productions that originate elsewhere, the UK has become the go-to destination.

The new Star Wars trilogy is set in a galaxy far, far away, yet it is being made at London’s Pinewood Studios. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock may have looked like they were weightless and out of control thousands of feet above the ground, but the Oscar-winning effects that put them there were created in a down-to-earth office in Soho.

And this isn’t just a London phenomenon. As Her Majesty the Queen saw this week, Game of Thrones’ Iron Throne isn’t in the mythical city of King’s Landing – it’s on a soundstage in the middle of Belfast. The show supports literally thousands of jobs across Northern Ireland and pumps around £100 million a year into the local economy.

Meanwhile the producer of Breaking Bad is currently on location in south Wales working on the latest series of Da Vinci’s Demons.

And the new TV adaptation of the Outlander books has just finished filming at sites across Scotland.  Diana Gabaldon, the American author behind Outlander, set her novel in the Highlands after seeing an old episode of Dr Who – which is, of course, another of Britain’s great creative exports.

This success of our creative industries is down to the hard work, dedication and sheer talent of Britain’s creatives. But the environment in which they have recently flourished was created by the Government.

Tax relief for the film, TV, animation and video game sectors has directly led to private sector investment worth hundreds of millions of pounds. In the last three years, employment within the creative industries has grown at five times the rate of the wider economy, and we’re investing more than £20 million in skills and training to back those who want to work hard and get on and to ensure there’s enough new talent in the pipeline. 

As part of our long-term economic plan, we’ll shortly be setting out an ambitious new strategy to double the value of creative industry exports to £31 billion, while also increasing the value of inward investment in creative UK businesses.

This Government’s commitment to the creative industries will be the focus on Monday when the Prime Minister hosts a reception for some of the sector’s leading figures. 

It’s not a showbiz party, or an attempt to bask in reflected glory and coolness.  It’s an opportunity to thank and encourage the sector, underline our support for the industry, and to remind investors around the world that, from Westeros to the Millennium Falcon, via Hogwarts and the Tardis, the UK is very much the centre of the creative universe.
