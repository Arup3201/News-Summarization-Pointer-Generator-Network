The decent thing for the Spanish league to do would be crafting a medal and a trophy for the club which finishes fourth next May. 

Despite more than a dozen different Spanish teams having qualified for the Champions League during the last 12 years — with Sevilla, Atletico, Valencia, Athletic and Espanyol all having either reached or won European finals during that span — and particularly with Atletico having broken the duopoly by winning the title last term, this is the season when there will most certainly only be one Champions League slot up for grabs.

Big money: Barcelona paid £75m to sign Luis Suarez from Liverpool

Certain one-eyed critics got stuck in such a rut talking about a two-horse race in Spain that they were soundly exposed by Diego Simeone’s title-winning side last season.

However, just in case anyone should be sufficiently effervescent to imagine that Los Rojiblancos were, vicariously, trampling down the door to the hegemony on behalf of other aspiring ‘could have been a contender’ clubs — think again.

Atletico’s spend this summer simply confirms that they have attacked the duopoly not on behalf of liberté, fraternité and égalité but in order to create a triumvirate at the top of Spanish soccer.

Right now the champions have invested close to €100 million, against which their accountants can balance the sales of Diego Costa, Adrian and Filipe Luis.

But it’s jaw-dropping that between Atletico, Real Madrid and Barcelona, the total gross expenditure on new players supersedes €350m.

Wild though it seems, there are rumours abounding that Atletico will add the purchase of the exceptional Marco Reus to their tally.

And even before you examine how that would push the three clubs’ spending close to the €400m mark, the key to that deal — should they pull it off — is how a club which still had to pre-qualify for the Europa League when they signed Diego Forlan and which was flirting with relegation when they recruited Simeone as manager two-and-a-half years ago could now fight off all of Europe’s premier clubs to sign this utter gem of a German footballer?

Right now these are reports, not hard facts, so let’s leave it at that.

But the idea of Reus being snapped up by Atletico fits with the theme which Real Madrid and Barcelona have established.

Enough, already, with the ‘which league is better?’, despite the repeated claims by those who receive the Premier League pound that it is the best in the world.

Value the product you watch (or participate in) precisely as you wish but something intriguing happened in Spain this summer.

Like him or loathe him, Luis Suarez can play a bit. When he abandoned Liverpool, it was to Barcelona he was determined to go. Not Arsenal, Chelsea or Manchester City.

Prime mover: Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kross boasts talent and experience

Arguably, Toni Kroos was the player of the World Cup. A fabulous technical and creative talent just approaching the prime years of his career and now world champion to go with his Bundesliga and Champions League titles.

Prime beef, but when he was on the hoof it was to Madrid he went — and remarkably cheaply as well.

How did England’s leading clubs miss out on him? Why on earth did he choose to leave the ‘football nirvana’ which Pep Guardiola is attempting to create in Bavaria — a process which has notably improved Kroos in the space of one season?

Then, James Rodríguez. A special talent and one who illuminated the World Cup. There’s no doubt that the special nature of his performance there will have over-inflated people’s expectations of him.

This is a kid who has all the weaponry but needs some time on the firing range. Some battle experience. He didn’t dominate French football at Monaco — but with maturity and exceptional team-mates around him, it’s predictable that we are about to see the blossoming of a special footballer.

Just right for Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, City, Liverpool — but, just like Gareth Bale, who turned United down last summer, he actively wanted to join Madrid.

None of this is part of the ‘our league is better than yours’ argument. But it is significant that the incredible buying power of the Premier League, television money, crowds and petrodollars combined, wasn’t enough to secure any of the three best talents to move this summer — with Reus still pending.

Prodigious talent: Koke of Atletico Madrid is Spain's young pass master

In terms of the title it’s a mini-league of three this term — and Madrid start with major advantages.

Last season they lacked depth of quality and stamina at the killer moments of the title race, but that’s been adequately addressed this summer with the market not yet closed. Just as he was asked to do last season, manager Carlo Ancelotti, Champions League and Copa Del Rey winner in his first season at the club, will be asked to forge some sort of equilibrium in his starting XI despite the fact that Rodríguez in midfield gives nowhere near the work rate, tackling and pressing of the deposed Angel di Maria.

When Ancelotti faced similarly tough tactical questions a year ago due to incorporating Bale, it took him a beat or two but, when the tempo was sorted, with an adventurous 4-3-3, they made sweet music.

If Lionel Messi, Neymar and Suarez all find a prolonged spell of fitness, energy and synchronisation under a new, brutally demanding, manager, and if Ivan Rakitic can add some of the youth and athleticism which Xavi now cannot, then Barcelona look interesting.

The reigning champions, fortified by Mario Mandzukic, Antoine Griezmann, Guilherme Siqueira and Jan Oblak, retain the ‘feel’ of a team you’d not like to meet down a dark alley on a Saturday night. Potential trophy winners again — but it’s to Madrid that all eyes will turn.

Six trophies lay in front of them and, after the Super Cup, it’s one down. This squad is in shape to add the majority of the rest of them.
