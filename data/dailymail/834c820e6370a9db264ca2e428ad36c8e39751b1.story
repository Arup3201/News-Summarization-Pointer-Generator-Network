Jimmy Greaves did not attend Wembley on Sunday. A lot of people tend to get upset when this happens. The one who doesn’t is Jimmy Greaves.

If he wanted to go, as a guest of either Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur, his former clubs, he could have secured a ticket, no problem.

The Football League would probably love to have him, too. The issue isn’t that Greaves is short of invitations. He’s just not that into it.

Jimmy Greaves was a great player, and doesn't need a fuss around him when he decides not to attend games

This can happen when you’re 75. Jimmy thinks of Wembley and, as much as the match — which he would enjoy — he imagines the queues of traffic on the North Circular, the hassles of parking and of spending the hour before kick-off having a big fuss made about his presence when he would rather be sat with a pot of tea in front of Liverpool and Manchester City and then the rugby. Jim loves the rugby.

Truth be told, if Ireland versus England captured his attention, he might even have delayed changing channels until it was over.

He finds it strange that people are still interested in getting him to Wembley. We want our heroes to behave like besotted fans, but Jim’s interests were always broader.

Greaves' interests were always broader than just football, and he should be left to enjoy his retirement

He liked playing, and was quite brilliant at it, but since retiring he’s as likely to be engrossed in a Test match as a cup final, and he hasn’t the ego to wish to be feted wherever he goes.

He doesn’t claim to be an expert on the modern game, having not been a part of it for so long, but feels no animosity towards the Premier League or its high-earning players.

For a man whose problems with alcohol led him to a psychiatric unit shortly after retirement, the second act of Jim’s life has been a triumph. We should perhaps acknowledge this, rather than wonder why he isn’t constantly seeking attention or another lap of honour.

We should wish every former athlete the quiet contentment of Jimmy Greaves.
