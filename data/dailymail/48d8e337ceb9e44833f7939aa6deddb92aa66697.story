Barclays is to close some bank branches and move them in to Asda supermarkets in a new ‘open all hours’ approach.

Eight will be switched during 2014, while more will follow in a policy that is expected to be taken up by the other mainstream banks.

The move will save Barclays a fortune because it will be able to sell off existing buildings, however it could upset and disrupt many loyal customers.

At the same time it could harm existing 
high streets, where retailers would lose the passing trade associated 
with people visiting bank branches and cash machines.

There also concerns that the range of services, particularly to small businesses, will be curtailed.

On a positive note, the new supermarket bank branches will open for the same hours as the supermarket, seven days a week, which is longer than normal.

Staff will only be on duty during normal bank hours, however there will be machines in place at other times to allow people to do simple things like pay bills and pay in or take out cash.

Barclays also insisted that services to small businesses in terms of paying in a large number of cheques, or withdrawing large cash sums will be maintained.

The move by Barclays follows an earlier decision by the Post Office to move many of its outlets in to branches of WHSmith, which has not been entirely successful. Customers have complained of a lack of staff and long queues at some outlets.

The first Barclays branch to go is in the Birchwood shopping centre in Warrington, where services and staff will move to a nearby Asda in February.

The next three to close will be in Albion Street, Broadstairs, Kent, Manor House Street, Pudsey, Leeds, and St Albans Road, Watford.

Steve Cooper, Head of Barclays Retail and Business Bank said the change will help people to shop and bank at the same time.

Longer hours: The closed branches will be relocated in Asda stores and will operate the same opening hours as the supermarket

‘We’ve spoken to our customers who use our everyday and business banking services in our branches and they’ve told us their time is precious so would benefit from being able to multi-task, park easily and visit branches with longer opening hours,’ he said

Asda’s Karen Hubbard, said: ‘This is the next step in the evolution of how we continue to make our stores relevant to our customers’ everyday needs, giving them access to banking services to use at their convenience – when they want, and how they want it.

‘Access to banking services is an under-rated but important asset to any community but in many areas, these services just aren't available to families. In partnership with Barclays, we’ll trial banking services in our stores for the communities which need it the most.’

The Campaign for Community Banking Services fears high streets could lose out once the branches close.

Director, Derek French, said: ‘If relocation to an Asda is the alternative to losing the branch altogether it has to be welcomed and clearly will reduce costs for Barclays.

‘However, a big question is whether the in-store outlet will provide the same transactional services to small businesses and charities as the conventional branch.

‘Also, location is important and many large supermarkets these days are sited away from the traditional high streets. What we see when banks pull out of local high streets is serious loss of business by other retailers as people and businesses from the surrounding area no longer come into the high street to bank and therefore no longer spend locally.’

Previous experiments with moving banks in to other retailers have not been successful. Lloyds tried it with Asda between 1997 and 2002, while HSBC did something similar with Morrisons. All the outlets subsequently closed.
