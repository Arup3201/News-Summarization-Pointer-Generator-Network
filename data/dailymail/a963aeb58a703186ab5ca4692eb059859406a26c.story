A councillor who died after spending 15 months waiting for a heart operation was 'let down by the NHS he loved'.

Ron Jones was suffering from severe heart disease and was waiting for surgery after doctors told him he needed a triple bypass and a new valve.

But Mr Jones, a councillor in Newport, South Wales, tragically died of heart failure last August, aged 78, after being stuck on the operation waiting list for 15 months.

His partner of 30 years, Pam Allen, is devastated that he was let down by the health service he had adored.

She said: 'He was let down by the NHS he loved. Why did he wait so long when they knew what was wrong with him?

'Why was he waiting 15 months from the point he was diagnosed? To me, heart surgery is an emergency.'

Mr Jones was told in May 2012 by Royal Gwent Hospital that he would need a double heart bypass and a new valve.

In autumn 2012, he was given an angiogram at the hospital, but his GP was furious when she discovered that he did not have any stents put in.

Ms Allen, 68, said: 'The doctor said that would have given him quality of life until he had the operation.'

Mr Jones needed a triple heart bypass and a new heart valve because of his severe heart disease

Mr Jones was told he would need a triple bypass at a further appointment in October at the University of Wales Hospital Cardiff.

Ms Allen, of Pill, Newport, said: 'The doctor said: "Do you have any questions?" We said: "When do we come in? Tomorrow?"

'He said: "No, three to six months".'

When Mr Jones was told in April that the operation wouldn’t be for the foreseeable future, she got Newport West Assembly Member Rosemary Butler involved.

The couple then received a letter saying that Mr Jones had been put on a 36-week waiting list - but that he had gone on the waiting list on December 17.

He was finally given an appointment for a pre-assessment clinic on June 5, 2013, and was told his operation would take place within six weeks. But the operation never took place.

Ms Allen said: 'In August, Ron woke up in the morning and went to the toilet, he came back and said I’m dying, I need an ambulance.'

The ambulance crew arrived quickly, but Mr Jones died before they could get him to hospital.

Ms Allen now has two complaints outstanding, against both the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and the Aneurin Bevan Health Board.

She said: 'I see him in this house every day, it still upsets me, I thought: right, something has got to be done. I have got to make a stand now.'

Last July, a damning report found that patients were 'dying regularly' waiting for surgery at the University of Wales Hospital Cardiff.

The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) branded Wales' biggest hospital 'dangerous' and said patients are at risk because of increased waiting lists.

The report found that patients were regularly dying on the 
waiting list from their cardiac pathology, 'mostly valvular disease’

At the time, managers at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said the ‘unacceptable’ situation was now being addressed and were looking at options to increase cardiac surgery capacity.

Cardiff and Vale University Health Board offered its sincerest condolences to Mr Jones' family for their loss.

A spokeswoman said the board is arranging a meeting between Mr Jones’ relatives and the clinical team.

Mr Jones' operation was due to take place at the University Hospital of Wales (pictured). The hospital has been investigated over claims patients are regularly dying as a result of lengthy waiting lists

The spokeswoman said: 'We would like to reassure the family that steps are being taken by health boards and the Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee to increase cardiac capacity.

'This has included further investment in the service, providing surgery at weekends and commissioning services from other providers.

'We would also like to reassure patients and their families waiting for treatment that arrangements are in place to regularly review and monitor patients on the waiting list.

'However if anyone has any concerns they should see their GP. We would also add that outcomes after cardiac surgery at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board are excellent, some of the best in the UK, and that clinical teams are constantly working to improve patient care and timely access to services.'
