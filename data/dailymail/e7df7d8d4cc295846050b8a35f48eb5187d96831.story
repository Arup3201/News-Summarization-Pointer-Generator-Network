It’s amazing how quickly things change in football. Last season Robin van Persie was Manchester United’s hero but now he looks like he’s had his nose put out of joint.

I’ve seen it before with players who are the main man and all of a sudden somebody takes their place. It seems to affect strikers more often because they have a greater sense of hierarchy.

Last season, it was all about Van Persie. He was Fergie’s golden boy but under Moyes it’s been a different story. United have been in poor form and so has the Dutchman. Wayne Rooney’s new contract shows how much the club value him and, little by little, you can see the confidence seeping away from Van Persie.

I am not suggesting he is a bad player. He is a sensational footballer and he was No 7 in my list of the top foreigners to grace the Premier League. But, at 30, Van Persie is not getting any younger and, if he is still not happy by the summer, I wouldn’t be surprised if United decide he is surplus to requirements.

STRAIGHT-TALKING TIM

After a result like Tottenham had at Stamford Bridge, it was refreshing to see a manager come out and talk with such honesty.

When Spurs manager Tim Sherwood spoke after the game, you could see how much the performance was hurting, and how much it meant to him. It was almost as if he couldn’t help himself. He is a real football man, he speaks from the heart and he just gave his honest view of the performance.

Some people don’t like that passion and you very rarely hear managers take on their players. There is a risk you might alienate the dressing room and Tim might have gone a bit far, but sometimes that’s what happens in the heat of the moment. He is no laptop manager and he calls it as he sees it. There has been talk in some quarters that if he doesn’t finish in the top four he will lose his job. That is ridiculous. Spurs might expect a top-four finish but they don’t have a divine right to be there — they’ve done it only twice in 24 years.

People will say his words will damage the dressing room, but there’s no better way for the players to prove themselves than in the north London derby on Sunday.

Fuming: Tim Sherwood pulled no punches after Spurs were thrashed by Chelsea

CLASSY CAULKER

Steven Caulker had a great game for Cardiff and continues to build on his impressive reputation. And when you look at some of Tottenham’s defending, you wonder why they let him go. If Spurs are in the market for a defender, Caulker is exactly the kind of person they would be going for. Chelsea re-signed Nemanja Matic after all, and stranger things have happened.

Case for the defence: Caulker has had a better season than many of his former Spurs team-mates

NOT BAD, SAMUEL, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS GAZZA!

It’s been a good weekend for goal celebrations. David Meyler headbutted a corner flag and I loved Samuel Eto’o’s on Saturday night. It was cheeky and a great way to respond to Jose Mourinho’s comments about his age — even Jose was laughing.

Some people have said it was the best ever, but if Eto’o gets a 9.9 from the judges, then Paul Gascoigne and the dentist’s chair gets a perfect 10. Before that game against Scotland he told us that he would go for it if he scored. We didn’t believe him but then he scored that incredible goal and he set off.

We all thought, ‘Where’s he going?’ Then he just sprawled out on the floor and we all joined in. It was a genius goal and a genius celebration.

SOME REAL CUP MAGIC

What a result for Wigan. I knew they would give City a tough game but I did not expect that. And it was deserved. They play good football, just as they did under Roberto Martinez, and Uwe Rosler uses a system that works. Arsene Wenger will feel like he’s won the pools. Arsenal could finally end the years without a trophy, but before they get too excited they should remember losing to Birmingham in the Carling Cup final four years ago. You can’t underestimate Wigan, who join only Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Barcelona in winning at the Etihad this season.

Hull boss Steve Bruce enjoyed a great result against Sunderland — one of his old clubs — and will face yet another in Sheffield United. Nigel Clough has done wonders at the Blades, taking them from 21st to 11th and winning nine on the spin. Hopefully Clough will soon have them back where they belong.

FULHAM NEED A MIRACLE

Fulham has always been a club that prides itself on stability, but they have caught the Premier League madness bug. To go through three managers in three months beggars belief, because there is no magic wand. They have fewer points at this stage than all three relegated sides had last season. It’s an awfully long way back from here.

In need a miracle: Fulham manager Felix Magath watched his side lose again

ENGLAND MEMO

We had a reminder on Saturday of the quality of some of England’s fringe players with good performances from Jay Rodriguez and Ross Barkley. Southampton’s Rodriguez has had a good season and though Barkley was on the losing side against Arsenal, his run to set up Everton’s goal was sensational. He is one of the few England central midfielders who can run with the ball at pace down the middle. Both would be unlucky to be left in the departure lounge rather than boarding the plane to Brazil.
