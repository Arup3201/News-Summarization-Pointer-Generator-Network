David Cameron will not be able to continue as Tory leader until 2020, Iain Duncan Smith warned today as speculation over the Prime Minister's future mounted.

Last week Mr Cameron vowed to serve 'every day' of a second term if he is re-elected on May 7, right up to the next election at the end of the decade.

But Mr Duncan Smith, himself a former leader, today insisted that Mr Cameron will have to stand before that to allow time for his successor to be chosen.

Mr Cameron stunned the Tory party with his dramatic revelation that he would not seek a third term.

The remarks triggered the start of an unofficial Tory leadership race, after he also tipped Boris Johnson, George Osborne and Theresa May as potential successors.

The Tory leader joked: 'Terms are like shredded wheat : two are wonderful but three might just be too many.'

The admission, in an interview with the BBC, caused dismay in large parts of the Tory party because it distracted from the party's core election message on the economy, and over-shadowed last week's news that inflation had fallen to zero per cent.

Mr Cameron defended his remarks, insisting he was 'just giving an honest answer to an honest question'.

Challenged on the Sky News/Channel 4 election debate, he insisted: 'If you vote Conservative I've said I will serve every day of a full second term.'

But at the very least he would need to stand aside several months before May 2020 to give his successor time to prepare for the general election.

There has been speculation that Mr Cameron could quit after his promised 2017 referendum on leaving the EU, whatever the outcome.

Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show the PM would choose the timing of his departure and he would be 'sorry to see him go'.

Asked if Mr Cameron has to 'stand down at some point during the next Parliament' in order to allow a successor to be in place for the election, Mr Duncan Smith said: 'He does. But I have huge faith in the Prime Minister. I think, given the nature of the terrible circumstances we inherited, under his leadership he's turned the economy around and taken some tough decisions.

'He will do what he says, which is he will serve what essentially is a full term. Of course, there will be a competition at some point, but I have to tell you that will be a competition on the back of a successful Prime Minister doing something that most prime ministers have never done before - saying 'I know when it's time to go'.

'You've had to literally rap the knuckles of people like Gordon Brown and previous prime ministers to get them to think of going. He is actually very keen to say 'There is a limit. There's an amount of time a prime minister should serve before they get stale.' And he is right about that.'

In the BBC interview when the Tory leader announced his plans to stand down, Samantha Cameron made a rare appearance on screen to endorse her husband as the right man to lead the country

Mr Duncan Smith was Tory leader from 2001 to 2003, when he was forced out in a vote of no confidence.

He said it was 'a different world' then, as the prime minister was at that point able to select the date of the election and it was 'very difficult to say what a full term was'.

The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act had allowed prime ministers to plan ahead with certainty about how long their term might be, he said.

Mr Duncan Smith refused to be drawn on the identity of possible successors, but suggested that it would be someone who is already in the public eye.

'I don't think that you're going to have in any shape or form a brand-new leader that the country has never seen, because all the people that might want to stand for that will have been up in the public sphere for some time,' he said.

'I'm not going to name names. I know that those who want to throw their hat in the ring will throw it very hard and those that don't will think about it.'
