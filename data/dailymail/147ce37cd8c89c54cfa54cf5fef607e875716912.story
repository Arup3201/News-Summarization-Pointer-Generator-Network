Sam Baldock is eyeing an FA Cup shock against Arsenal to give Brighton relief from their season of struggle.

The Seagulls host the Gunners on Sunday in the fourth round having battled relegation for most of the campaign.

They are 19th in the Sky Bet Championship under new manager Chris Hughton.

Brighton manager Chris Hughton has made a positive impact since taking over as boss in December

The former Norwich boss has won three of his first four games, including 2-0 third-round win over Brentford, since replacing Sami Hyypia in December.

Brighton are six points above the bottom three ahead of their clash against Arsenal at the Amex Stadium.

And striker Baldock, who scored in Wednesday's 3-2 win over Ipswich, is eager to take a break from the league.

"It could be a welcome break from the league," he told the club's official website. "Obviously when you go flat out with so many games in quick succession and you're not picking up the points you feel you should be, then it can drag on a little bit. It's going to be a good occasion and a good test for us.

"There's a bit of buzz around now and we can firmly look forward to Arsenal as an occasion and as a test for ourselves. We've all got ambitions to play at the highest level and what better way to test ourselves."
