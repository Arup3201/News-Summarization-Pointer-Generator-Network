Balancing 100ft above the ground these UK daredevils attempt a one of a kind high octane race. 

Looking to cross 60 feet between two turrets at Eastnor Castle in Hertfordshire, these daring highliners are set to appear on new ITV show Red or Black.

Top British slackliners Phil Baxter, 24, from Lancashire, and red-shirt Allen Freem, 20, from South Wales, were to show off their skills in front of millions of UK viewers.

Elf 'n' safety gone mad: Allen Freem walks between two turrets at Castle Eastnor for Red or Black on ITV. It is the first time slackliners have been granted access to one of Britain's most picture-perfect castles

Don't look down: Allen Freem balances as he walks along the line which is a lot more wobbly than an ordinary tightrope

Slacklines are more like trampolines than tightropes because they move around a lot as the daredevil inches across.

On Red or Black competitors fighting for the £1m prize will have to guess whether Phil or Allen will be first to get across.

Slackliner director, Russ Holbert, 36, from Poole, Dorset ,was approached by the show's producers to make sure they had the right people for the stunt performed in front of a live audience.

'ITV called my office because we're seen as the leading slackliners in the country,' explained Russ.

'They wanted to know about our experience and find out if this feat was even possible.

'We
 started to discuss likely candidates and I decided on Phil and Allen 
because they both had climbing as well as slacklining backgrounds.

'There was only going to shot at this, so we had to make sure we had people who could pull it off.'

Phil has been a slackliner for four years and and Allen for three years - both are seasoned rock climbers in their own right.

While
 this training has given them nerves of steel and they spent two full 
days practising for the stunt, nothing could have prepared them fully 
for the pressure of performing at such an impressive venue - as part of a
 televised competition.

'Before
 the event, Allen and Phil were both saying - is this really going to 
happen am I really going to step out over this massive void in front of 
masses of people?' said Russ.

'Usually when they highline they're doing it for their own satisfaction.

'Suddenly
 when your put in front of a massive crowd of screaming contestants 
you've got that added pressure and expectation on your shoulders.

'This is on top of the discipline and concentration you need to complete this incredibly demanding stunt.

'The crowd were all jumping up and down - they couldn't believe how good it went and the realise of tension was amazing.

'Even Ant and Dec couldn't believe their eyes.'

Slacklining may be new to most people - but surprisingly the sport has taken off in many parts of Britain.

'For this kind of high-lining you do need to have had years of training and a head for heights,' said Russ.

'But other types of slacklining are hugely accessible and local clubs are running across the country.

'This is the entry point to more spectacular stunts like this one.

'It's fantastic exercise with the kinds of eye-popping acrobatic moves that young people love to see and take part in.'
