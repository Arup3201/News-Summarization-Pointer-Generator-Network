The mother of missing Ben Needham has returned to the Greek island of Kos, more than two decades after the toddler's disappearance.

Kerry Grist, 40, arrived on the Mediterranean holiday isle yesterday as British police began searching farmland where the 21-month-old was last seen in 1991.

Detectives believe that a small Dinky toy car belonging to Ben could be key to discovering his fate.

They are using specialist scanning equipment to search for signs of buried metal as well as possible human remains.

At work: One theory is the toddler was accidentally trapped beneath piles of dirt and building material which were being dumped on the plot by a JCB digger

They are hoping to uncover items 
belonging to the youngster, including a metal toy car he was believed to
have been playing with at the time of his disappearance.

Ben
was being cared for by his grandparents Eddie and Christine Needham 
when he vanished from outside a remote farmhouse in the hamlet of 
Iraklis in July 1991.

One
theory is the toddler was accidentally trapped beneath piles of dirt 
and building material which were being dumped on the plot by a JCB 
digger working nearby.

Despite a number of possible sightings, no trace of the youngster has been found.

Clinging to her mother - Ben's grandmother - Mrs Grist today told reporters: 'Coming to the island knowing the search experts are looking 
for my son was heart-wrenching, but I believe that my son Ben is alive 
and out there somewhere.

'I understand this search has to be done. I am still determined to 
find my son and I make a plea to anyone who has been watching this to 
come forward and to let me know what happened to Ben and end my family's
pain and suffering.

'I will never give up the search until I find out what happened to Ben.

'Myself and my family are stronger than ever now and we will do 
whatever it takes to find Ben and let him know the truth of who he is.'

Missing: Ben Needham went missing at the age of 21 months during a holiday in July 1991

Mrs Grist last night said she will not visit the scene of the police search because it would be too heartbreaking.

Ben’s grandfather, Eddie Needham, made an emotional return to the scene over the weekend to help police with their search.

The 63-year-old looked strained as he recalled the details of the day in 1991 when he last saw his 21-month-old grandson.

As well as employing handheld metal 
detectors, a Home Office specialist has been scanning the fields 
surrounding the farmhouse with a magnetometer – a device which can 
identify iron and steel-based objects buried tens of meters underground.

The 22-strong British search team, which flew out to the island last week, is being led by Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick of South Yorkshire Police.

Speaking at the scene yesterday, he said: ‘We are looking for toys from Ben, anything which could indicate where he had been.

‘He was a 21-month-old child. He would have had toys with him. The family say he was definitely playing with toys, a Dinky toy car, that sort of thing.

'We are looking for anything which may support that and give us an indication of where he might be.

‘A magnetometer basically identifies and locates ferrous metals. It is like a very powerful metal detector. 

‘We are interested in anything which might identify the movements of Ben, any item of clothing, any toys, anything Ben may have been playing with.

'We are looking for belt buckles, buttons on trousers or a shirt.

‘Anything that might give us an indication of where Ben was when he was here and how far into the field he ventured, to give us some clarity on Ben’s movements immediately prior to his disappearance.’

Specialist sniffer dogs brought over from Britain were also deployed over the weekend, but failed to detect a scent.

A forensic archaeologist is also at hand to help identify if any bones discovered during the search are human.

Yesterday, DS Fenwick praised the Needham family for their assistance in the case, as he revealed that diggers would begin work on the site today.

He said: ‘One thing we have done is regressive interviews with all the Needham family. We spent a whole week interviewing the family about the land and all the circumstances at the time.

He added: ‘We are going to get the digger out tomorrow. The JCB will be there. It is the next stage of the process. We will be removing some ground.’
