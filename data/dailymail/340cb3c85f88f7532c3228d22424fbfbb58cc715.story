COMMENT: Soloists sabotage the team ethic at Swansea City

Swansea's preparations for Sunday's home defeat by Chelsea were undermined by an amazing training-ground fight.

The
 extraordinary incident involved six players from the first-team squad 
and took place during a full-scale practice match last Wednesday.

Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins was left stunned after witnessing the fierce clashes between players.

Crisis: Swansea manager Garry Monk saw his bid to repair squad rift backfire

Although he has not taken disciplinary action against those involved, Jenkins is becoming increasingly alarmed about the friction in the Swansea dressing room.

According to training-ground sources, there were three incidents during the high-tempo session organised by interim manager Garry Monk. It is understood players had to be separated after tempers flared and tackles got out of hand.

The incredible scenes will do nothing to help morale at the club.

Monk, who took over when Michael Laudrup was fired, is attempting to repair relations between the players and unite the squad as they try to avoid relegation.

Swansea lost 1-0 at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday against Chelsea 
and went down to 10 men after Chico Flores was sent off for a second 
bookable offence.

Monk had organised the training game with the 
specific brief to get the 1-0 defeat at Hull five days previously out 
of the system.

Instead, it turned into an opportunity for players who have issues with the work ethic of team-mates to start picking fights.

Swansea
 have struggled to build on last season's success, when they qualified 
for the Europa League after beating Bradford in the Capital One Cup 
final.

This is not the first time the club's dressing room has been ripped apart by in-fighting among the players.

In January, Sportsmail revealed that Flores had picked up a brick during a row with Monk.

A
 member of the public witnessed the incident and called police, claiming
 Flores had grabbed a brick and threatened Monk with it.

Just two weeks later Laudrup, who led the team to a ninth-place finish in the Barclays Premier League last season, was fired.

Off you go: Swansea's cause was hit by the first-half dismissal of defender Chico Flores against Chelsea

Swansea
 have won just one of their last nine games in the top flight and stand 
three points above the drop zone ahead of Saturday's trip to Newcastle.

The
 club brought in a number of players last summer to help cope with the 
added demands of playing in the Europa League for the first time. 

Wilfried
 Bony, who has been a success leading the attack since joining from 
Vitesse Arnhem, earns £58,000 a week, for example. But the influx of 
high earners has affected morale in the dressing room and Jenkins plans 
to make a number of strategic changes in the summer. 

There are other
 issues at the club and a source claimed one player was caught 
refuelling with crisps at half-time in a recent match.
