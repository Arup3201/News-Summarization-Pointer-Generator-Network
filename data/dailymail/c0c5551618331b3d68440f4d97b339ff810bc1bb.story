A filmmaker is hoping a Kickstarter will help her finish Dennis Hopper's last movie, five years after his death. 

Director Linda Yellen along side Michael Leeds co-wrote the comedy The Last Film Festival, starring Dennis Hopper, Jacqueline Bisset, JoBeth Williams, Chris Kattan, Donnell Rawlings, Katrina Bowden, Joseph Cross and Leelee Sobieski.

They began filming in 2009, but production ended with only five scenes left to shoot when Hopper, best known for his role in Easy Rider, died from cancer in 2010, aged 74.

After Hopper's passing the cast and crew set aside the project until this year, when Yellen decided to pick it up. 

'There's a wonderful thing that happens with time - perspective - and it was so hard for us to look at after he had died,' Yellen told Deadline.

'What forced me back into the editing room was the constant chatter on the Internet and emails wondering about the film, and we now feel we could do it without the pain that we once felt. 

'That's the beauty of being an independent filmmaker you can put it on hold.'  

Yellen said she, the cast and crew only found out about Hopper's cancer just shortly before he died. 

'He was a picture of health and vitality and he just gives a multilevel comedic act [in the film],' Yellen said. 

'He had no idea he was sick; we had no idea he was sick.' 

Yellen hopes to raise $90,000 to finish The Last Film Festival (pictured above). In the film, Hopper plays a Hollywood producer who's film was rejected by every film festival except the small town O'Hi Film Festival

She turned to Kickstarter with a goal of raising at least $90,000 in hopes of reaching fans directly and using Hopper's idea of 'always looking for ways to go around the system', according to the Queens Courier. 

Though she reached her goal on Sunday night, the Kickstarter page will be open until April 9.

The film is about the life of a Hollywood producer, played by Hopper, who's movie was rejected by every film festival except one: a small festival in the town of O'Hi. 

Though it takes place in a small town, the movie was actually filmed in Queens, including parts of Astoria and Forest Hills, where Yellen grew up, according to Fox News.

The funds raised from the campaign will pay for post-production aspects, including sound, special effects, obtaining rights to use footage from other movies and editing.  

'This is a way of [the fans] saying we want this and we want to say we support this film and this comedy,' Yellen told the Courier. 

'This picture was made as a labor of love. Just the pleasure of doing good work and wanting it out there and wanting people to laugh a lot.'
