It was a traditional dialect used for centuries by fisherfolk.

But yesterday it emerged that the language of Cromarty had finally died with the passing of its last speaker.

Bobby Hogg was the only person still fluent in the age-old tongue of the Black Isle and his death at the age of 92 means it will now exist only in audio recordings.

End of an era: Bobby Hogg, the last native speaker of the Cromarty dialect, has died aged 92

Mr Hogg, a retired engineer, said 
recently he could still close his eyes, see the boats heading out to sea
 and hear the unique speech pattern – never normally written down – that
 set his people apart.

His younger brother Gordon had been the other surviving speaker – but he died in April last year, aged 86.

Yesterday,
 Dr Robert McColl Millar, of Aberdeen University’s linguistic 
department, said Mr Hogg’s death was highly significant.

He
 added: ‘It is the first time that an actual Scots dialect has so 
dramatically died with the passing of the last native speaker.

‘This
 was always going to be the danger of the Black Isle, as there were so 
few speakers even when it was healthy, when the fishing was still good.

‘So Bobby Hogg’s passing is a very sad day. It was a very interesting dialect and was unlike any of the others.

‘There
 are one or two who still have some facility in the Cromarty fisherfolk 
dialect but most of the time they speak Highland English.

Bobby
 was the last fluent native speaker who spoke no other tongue from a 
child. He was what we term a “dense” speaker. So all we have now are the
 recordings.’

Mr Hogg, who died on Sunday, had worked across Britain, but kept coming back to Cromarty.

His wife Helen was a direct descendent of the community’s most celebrated son, 19th century polymath Hugh Miller.

But the Hoggs were from the fishing 
community. In 2007, the brothers were recorded by Am Baile, the project 
that has created a digital archive of the history and culture of the 
Highlands and Islands.

Mr
 Hogg said: ‘Our father was a fisherman and all his folk had been 
fishermen stretching way back. It was the same on our mother’s side too.
 When we were young, we talked differently in the fishertown to the rest
 of Cromarty.

‘It wasn’t written down. It was an oral culture. We had this sort of patois, which I think had both Doric and Gaelic in it.

'There
 were words, a lot to do with the fishing, which nobody else could 
understand. It is dying out. You hear a smattering in some things people
 from Cromarty say, but nobody speaks it fluently but for us.’
