Two-thirds of parents of overweight children are in denial – and some even think their youngsters are in need of fattening up, a study found.

The researchers warned that parents need to recognise the problem if they are to tackle it.

In England, 22 per cent of children are overweight or obese on starting school. By age 10 or 11, 33 per cent have a weight problem.

Many parents do not realise their children are overweight but it can cause a lifetime of health problems

Although it is easy to dismiss chubbiness as puppy fat that will be grown out of, childhood obesity can create a lifelong legacy of health problems from heart disease to cancer and diabetes.

It may also affect a child’s chances in life, with recent research finding obese schoolchildren get lower grades.

In the latest study, the Swedish researchers weighed and measured more than 16,000 boys and girls aged between two and nine and from eight European countries.

Parents were asked their perception of their child’s weight.

This revealed that 63 per cent of parents of overweight children thought them to be a normal size.

In some cases, parents of children who were so overweight that they were classed as obese believed them to be underweight.

The International Congress on Obesity heard that perceptions were most skewed in southern European countries – where obesity rates are higher than in the north.

The Gothenburg University researchers said this suggests that our idea of a healthy weight is based on what we see around us.

So, if a child’s friends are overweight, we believe it is normal for our child to be a similar size.

Parents may also dismiss dangerous levels of plumpness as ‘puppy fat’ that will be grown out of.

Staffan Marild said: ‘But research doesn’t support that at all.

‘The vast majority of children that are obese aged four will remain obese for the rest of their lives.’

He added that the tendency of well-meaning grandparents and divorced parents to spoil children is also a ‘great problem’.

Dr Marild added that regular weighing and measuring of children from a young age could help get the message across to parents.

The threat of childhood obesity will be one of the main themes discussed at the Kuala Lumpur conference.

Professor Walmir Coutinho, president-elect of the World Obesity Forum, which is running the event, said: ‘Once people become obese it is very hard for them to return to a normal body weight.’

The study didn’t include the UK. However, previous British research has come up with similar figures, with seven in ten parents of overweight children refusing to accept the problem.

Plus, British adults are increasingly failing to recognise that their own weight is an issue.
