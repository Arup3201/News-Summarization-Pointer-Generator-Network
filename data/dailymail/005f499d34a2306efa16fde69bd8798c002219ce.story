The singer of indie rock band Bright Eyes is suing a woman for $1million after she accused him of raping her after a concert when she was 16 in a series of online posts.

Conor Oberst filed the lawsuit yesterday claiming he was libelled by the woman, who he has identified as Janie Faircloth, who claimed she was sexually assaulted by the singer-songwriter at a 2003 concert.

An attorney for Oberst filed the civil lawsuit in a Manhattan federal court, with the legal documents claiming Ms Faircloth was a liar who made 'despicable, false, outrageous, and defamatory statements' about Oberst last December.

According to Mr Oberst's lawsuit, Ms Faircloth posted accusations on website XOJane.com that the singer songwriter raped her a decade ago in North Carolina after his brother, who was her English teacher at school, introduced the two at one of the singer's concerts.

She also accused Mr Oberst of punching her in the face, according to the legal papers, which add that she was 16 at the time.

The three comments were written underneath an article about domestic violence for website's It Happened to Me series, and were later shared on other blogs.

These posts have since been deleted from the site.

Mr Oberst, who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, is best known for his work with Bright Eyes, including song First Day Of My Life.

He has stongly denied Ms Faircloth's allegations and is seeking monetary damages, attorney fees and other costs.

The 33-year-old musician says the media coverage that resulted from the three posts in the comments section of a blog has damaged his career, especially in New York where most of the major music publishing houses have their headquarters.

He says he was in the company of his brother, bandmates or then-girlfriend at the time the claims were made, and the suit also says the woman has made positive social media comments about the guitarist over the last 10 years.

According to the lawsuit, Ms Faircloth said in the posts that she never reported the assault because of the way her own family and friends reacted to the accusations. She says she posted his name a decade later to help others and at the suggestion of her husband.

Both Mr Oberst's attorney and Ms Faircloth were approached for comment.
