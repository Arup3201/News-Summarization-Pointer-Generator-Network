A Utah family has adopted a four-year-old Down syndrome girl from Russia, just before President Vladimir Putin moved to ban U.S. citizens bringing the country's children to America.

Heather and Jeremy Fillmore welcomed little Hazel into their home on Christmas Eve after fighting for almost a year to get her here.

But they will be among the last of more than 60,000 American families to bring up a Russian child as their own as Russia signed a bill today outlawing the process.

Putin's approval of the adoption ban will leave nearly 50 Russian children on the verge of adoption by U.S. families now stranded.

The bill has angered Americans and 
Russians who argue it victimises children to make a political point, 
cutting off a route out of frequently dismal orphanages for thousands of
children.

The measure is retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, legislation that calls for sanctions against Russian officials deemed 
human rights violators, after Russia imprisoned lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who later died, after uncovering a £143million fraud.

The bill's signing coincides with a Moscow court acquitting the only official charged with his death.

The Russian-language hashtag 'PutinEatsKids' was trending on Twitter just minutes after Putin signed it.

Unicef
estimates that there are about 740,000 children not in parental custody
in Russia while about 18,000 Russians are on the waiting list to adopt a
child.

The law also blocks dozens of Russian children now being adopted by American families from leaving the country.

The
US is the biggest destination for adopted Russian children - more than 
60,000 of them have been taken in by Americans over the past two 
decades.

The 
U.S. State Department says it regrets the Russian Parliament's decision 
to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up 
in families.

Amnesty International Europe and 
Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a 
childish response to the Magnitsky Act.

'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.'

Preempting criticism of the move, Putin promised measures to better care for his country's orphans.

'I
intend to sign also a presidential decree that will modify the support 
mechanisms for orphaned children ... especially those who are in a 
difficult situation, by that I mean in poor health,' Putin said.

Critics of the bill say the Russian authorities are playing political games with the lives of children. The U.S. State Department repeated its concerns over the measure.

'Since 1992 American families have 
welcomed more than 60,000 Russian children into their homes, and it is 
misguided to link the fate of children to unrelated political 
considerations,' State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said in a 
statement.

Ventrell added that the United States was troubled by provisions in the bill that would restrict the ability of Russian civil society organizations to work with U.S. partners.

Children in Russia's crowded and troubled orphanage system - particularly those with serious illnesses or disabilities - will have less of a chance of finding homes, and of even surviving, child rights advocates said.

It took about 11 months for the Fillmores to bring Hazel home from Russia. She arrived at Salt Lake City International Airport at 11pm on Christmas Eve.

'It's been tough, but worth it, and to have her here and be part of our family, it's now great,' Jeremy Fillmore told the Deseret News. 'We feel like we're complete and we're excited to have her.'

Children with disabilities are placed into institutions when they turn five years old, and they are taken off a database of orphaned children, so it makes it almost impossible to find them a permanent home, the Fillmores said.

At the institutions, the basic needs of the children are met, but they are given no education or attention, they said.

They found Hazel through a website that advocates for children with special needs called Reece’s Rainbow Down Syndrome Adoption Ministry. According to the newspaper, she was the second girl they adopted from Russia with the help of the website. Anya, who is now 7 years old, was adopted in March 2011.

Nearly 50 children who were on the 
verge of being adopted by Americans are expected to stay in Russia 
despite the fact many of them have already been authorised by courts.

'We know a lot of families who have already been to Russia and have met their children,' Heather Fillmore said.

Deep concerns: The U.S. State Department said it had 'deep concerns' about the welfare of more than 700,000 Russian children in orphanages, particularly those with disabilities like Hazel, pictured

'You just don't know how, you feel like they're your children, and the thought of them being locked away in an institution for the rest of their lives is almost hard to even bear.'

Fillmore told the Deseret News she fears for children with special needs.'

'It's just sickening,' she said. 'I don't even want to believe that it can happen because it's very personal to us. We know many families who are in the process to go to save these children from a horrible life. It just doesn't make any sense that the children are the ones that are suffering because of retaliation in politics.'

Americans points to people like Jessica Long, who was given up shortly after birth by her parents in Siberia but was raised by adoptive parents in the United States and became a Paralympic swimming champion.

However, the Russian authorities point to the deaths of 19 Russian-born children adopted by American parents in the past decade, and lawmakers named the bill after a boy who died of heat stroke in Virginia after his adoptive father left him locked in a car for hours.

Putin reiterated Russian complaints that U.S. courts have been too lenient on parents in such cases, saying Russia has inadequate access to Russian-born children in the United States despite a bilateral agreement that entered into force on November 1.

But Putin, who began a new six-year term in May and has searched for ways to unite the country during 13 years in power, suggested there were deeper motives for such a ban.

'For centuries, neither spiritual nor state leaders sent anyone abroad,' he said, indicating he was not speaking specifically about Russia but about many societies.

'They always fight for their national identities - they gather themselves together in a fist, they fight for their language, culture,' he said.

The banning of American adoptions plays on sensitivity in Russia about adoptions by foreigners, which skyrocketed as the social safety net unraveled with the 1991 Soviet collapse. Families from the United States adopt more Russian children than those of any other country.
