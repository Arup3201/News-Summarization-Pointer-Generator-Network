Tragic: City worker Elsa Carneau, 25, was discovered face down in the water at Virgin Active in Kensington, West London, two years ago

One of Sir Richard Branson’s health clubs has been fined £100,000 after a former model drowned in an unsupervised swimming pool.

City worker Elsa Carneau, 25, was discovered face down in the water at Virgin Active in Kensington, West London, two years ago.

She was discovered face down in the water at the company’s flagship £145-a-month High Street Kensington branch two years ago.

Yesterday her grieving parents were in court to hear the company blasted for a series of health and safety failings.

Prosecutors said the risks leading to Elsa’s death were ‘entirely foreseeable’ and said managers were responsible for a string of ‘serious shortcomings’.

It was revealed that blundering staff didn’t even know the young woman’s identity and were forced to search her clothing after her death.

They then falsified paperwork to pretend they had been monitoring the pool in a ‘distasteful’ bid to cover their tracks.

But her father, Pierre, 61, said his daughter’s death has left a ‘scar on our lives’ and many questions remain unanswered.

He said: ‘We are interested in only one thing - to try and understand exactly what happened, there are still a number of questions.

‘This is the beginning of an explanation. We hope a number of other important things will be addressed in due course.’

Staff discovered Elsa floating in the unsupervised pool at Virgin Active, near London’s Hyde Park, as the closed up on the evening of Saturday, December 3, 2011.

The Imperial College graduate and 200m runner had been seen swimming 25 lengths of breast stroke in a ‘relaxed manner’ before the tragedy.

She was also seen holding her breath under water while timing herself at the health club, which includes a luxury gym and spa.

But it is not known how long the French national was unconscious, as the pool was not manned by a lifeguard or adequately monitored by CCTV.

Staff dragged her out of the water and desperately tried to revive her and she was rushed to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital where she was pronounced dead.

An investigation found ‘serious shortcomings in the management of risks connected with swimming activity at the club’.

Prosecutor James Ageros said there were a catalogue of errors and anomalies in risk assessments dating back to 2009.

He told Southwark Crown Court that ‘the risks were entirely foreseeable’ and staff failed to check the pool every 30 minutes.

Documents on CCTV checks were then falsified on the day of the tragedy by unknown staff members in a ‘distasteful’ bid to cover their tracks.

Mr Ageros, who represented Kensington and Chelsea Council, said: ‘There were no recorded checks at all on the day.

‘We say there was deliberate falsification of the records to make it seem as though checks, which had not been done, were done.’

An investigation found staff had not 
been properly briefed on potential risk. There were also no signs to 
inform visitors the pool was unsupervised.

Staff
 failed to ensure Elsa filled in a customer questionnaire and were 
forced to search her belongings to find her identification.

Fining
 the club £100,000 and ordering them to pay almost £32,000 costs, Judge 
Alistair McCreath said: ‘The first thing that must be said is a word of 
sympathy for those who grieve for a young life needlessly lost.

‘A fine cannot be any measure of the value of life that has been lost.

‘It’s
 impossible to demonstrate the corporate faults of Virgin Active caused 
this dreadful death so I must punish them not for causing that harm.

‘But
 I must punish them for the culpability they have, the blame they must 
bear, for failures to make proper assessments of risk and to manage that
 effectively.

‘This is a 
company that generally has a good safety record but it’s equally clear 
in relation to the premises where this event happened, the picture is 
entirely different.’

Elsa, who lived with her family at their £1m home in Gunnersbury, West London, switched careers from modelling to finance and had a job at Man Group, the world’s biggest hedge fund.

She was working in the client advisory group at GLG Partners, which was bought by Man Group for £1.1billion in 2010.

Prior to that she worked as an analyst for investment management firm, M3 Capital Partners, which has offices in London, Chicago, Hong Kong and New York.

She had been on the books of Time Models in Zurich where she was described her as ‘a great girl’ who was loved by staff.

Simon Antrobus, for Virgin Active, said the business deeply regretted the tragedy, adding that an ‘apology counts for very little in the circumstances.’

He told the court: 'The findings of the investigation, damaging and embarrassing as they are, are out of corporate character for the business.

‘No one thought this was a swimming pool that required constant supervision and it demonstrably did not.’

He said staff have been sacked in Kensington venue and pools across all 112 Virgin Active clubs now have ‘constant poolside supervision’.

A Virgin Active spokesman said: 'Elsa Carneau’s family and friends have our deepest sympathies for this tragic incident. 

'Health and safety is of paramount importance in our clubs and with our staff.  Following an extensive investigation by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, as well as one by Virgin Active, there has not been any suggestion that Elsa Carneau’s tragic death was related to the health and safety standards at our Kensington club.

'Under Health & Safety Executive guidance, it is not a requirement to have a dedicated lifeguard on duty at the Kensington pool.

'However, the safety of our members is of primary importance which is why we took the decision in 2012 to exceed the requirements of HSE guidance and have a dedicated lifeguard on duty at all times at every one of our pools.'

Speaking after the hearing, Elsa’s sister, Heidi, 31, said: ‘It just seems so unreal. We are just trying to work out how this could possibly happen.

‘It makes it very hard to find closure. We are constantly asking, ‘what if?’ and wondering if things could have been changed.

‘It’s out of our control, there is information we don’t have access to, to get the answers we need.’

Describing her younger sister she said: ‘To me, she was bright, very bubbly, energetic, always someone who would stand out.

‘She was very elegant, stylish and was always smiling.’

Standing with his wife Veronique, 59, Mr Carneau added: ‘We are a very close family and life is not the same. It’s a scar on our lives.’
