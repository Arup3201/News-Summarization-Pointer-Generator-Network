Tough new A-levels will see a return to teenagers studying traditional subjects in greater depth to restore rigour to the exams.

In English literature pupils will focus on eight instead of 12 texts, while in history they will examine a broader sweep of crucial events to better prepare them for university.

Sixth-formers will also need to display more mathematical ability in biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, economics and psychology exams.

Changes: Tougher new A-levels will see a return to teenagers studying traditional subjects in greater depth

In a separate move, coursework at A-level is set to be cut back in an effort to toughen up the exams and prevent cheating.

In future, the qualifications should include coursework only if a particular skill cannot be assessed by exam, such as in geography fieldwork or art, exam regulator Ofqual said.

The Government is introducing harder A-levels in most subjects from September 2015, with reformed maths, further maths and languages A-levels following in 2016.

Ministers have already announced that teenagers will be tested at the end of two years – with no exams in the first 12 months – to stop courses being broken into bite-sized chunks that encourage formulaic teaching.

In English literature, pupils will need to study a minimum of eight texts  including one Shakespeare play

AS-levels, currently taken in the first year of the sixth form, will become stand-alone qualifications, with marks no longer counting towards final A-level grades.

Professor Mark Smith, vice chancellor of Lancaster University, chaired an independent review of A-levels and yesterday a consultation document, drawn up by exam boards and university academics, was published outlining the proposed subject content of the ‘rigorous’ new exams.

In English literature, pupils will need to study a minimum of eight texts, which must include at least three works from before 1900, including one Shakespeare play, and a post-2000 work.

This will enable sixth-formers to look at novels and plays in more detail. Currently, teenagers study six texts at AS-level and a further six at A-level.

English literature candidates will also be examined on a previously ‘unseen’ text. ‘To prepare for examinations with “unseen texts”, students will need to read widely, broadening their knowledge and their critical and comparative understanding of literature,’ the consultation document says.

In history, sixth-formers will have to study topics from a period of at least 200 years rather than the current range of 100 years, which is now considered ‘too narrow’.

The focus on British history has been reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent because it was felt that pupils will have already developed a ‘good understanding’ from GCSE studies.

More maths is being introduced to economics, computer science and psychology A-levels as well as the three sciences.

Other changes include a new emphasis on drawing in art and design, and fieldwork being reintroduced in geography so pupils ‘relate their learning to real experiences of the world’.
