A Seattle author and mother-of-two has penned her own heartbreaking but humorous obituary before she died of cancer.

Jane Catherine Lotter, 60, was described by loved ones as a strong minded woman with great spunk who knew from an early age that she loved to write so it came as no surprise to her family when she told them she wanted to have the final word on her life.

They'd never heard of someone doing that before but her daughter, Tessa, immediately replied: 'Of course you are.' And it didn't disappoint.

Beloved husband: 'Bobby M, I love you up to the sky,' she wrote of her husband, Bob Marts, pictured with her in their youth

The paid obituary was published in The Seattle Times on July 28 - 10 days after she passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her beloved husband and children.

Poignantly displaying her wit, charm, lust for life and love for her family and friends, Lotter spoke to the reader from beyond the grave, or more accurately, from Elliott Bay, where her ashes were scattered.

Lotter began: 'One of the few 
advantages of dying from Grade 3, Stage IIIC endometrial cancer, 
recurrent and metastasized to the liver and abdomen, is that you have 
time to write your own obituary. (The other advantages are no longer 
bothering with sunscreen and no longer worrying about your 
cholesterol.)'

Journalists
around the United States were so taken with the obituary, they posted 
it on their Twitter feeds and it has been reprinted in newspapers 
including the New York Times.

Final words: Jane Catherine Lotter, 60, pictured left and right, was described by loved ones as a strong minded woman with great spunk

Loved ones: Jane, pictured left with her sister Barbara in 2012, and right died from Grade 3, Stage IIIC endometrial cancer last month

The author stuck to traditional 
obituary style for much of the piece, describing how she was born in 
Seattle on August 10, 1952, graduated from the University of Washington 
and was survived by her husband of 29 years, Bob Marts, and their two 
adult children, Tessa and Riley.

But she also got personal, particularly with reference to her family, and the result was tear-jerkingly beautiful.

'Bobby
M, I love you up to the sky,' she wrote, adding that the night they met
- November 22, 1975 at the Central Tavern in Pioneer Square - was the 
'luckiest night of my life.'

'Thank you for all the laughter and the love, and for standing by me at the end.'

To her children, she wrote 'Tessa and Riley, I love you so much, and I'm so proud of you. I wish you such good things,' before offering some life advice.

'May you, every day, connect with the brilliancy of your own spirit. And may you always remember that obstacles in the path are not obstacles, they ARE the path.'

Author: Lotter, pictured as a young woman, was a freelance writer, editor, and proofreader

Sisters: Jane, pictured left in 1961, was survived by her sisters Julie, center, and Barbara, right and another sister Kathleen

Describing her achievements as a 
freelance writer, editor and proofreader is where her humor shines, and 
she even managed a final plug to her 2009 novel The Bette Davis Club.

'I
received a First Place Society of Professional Journalists award for 
Humorous Writing for my column Jane Explains... I would demonstrate my 
keen sense of humor by telling a few jokes here, but the Times charges 
for these listings by the column inch and we must move on.'

Lotter learned in early 2010 that she had uterine cancer and went through intense treatment.

But
last year, when the illness came back and was terminal, she said she 
'decided to be joyful about having had a full life, rather than sad 
about having to die. Amazingly, this outlook worked for me. (Well, you 
know, most of the time.)'

Beautiful day, happy to be here: Marts gave out buttons at Lotter's memorial service with the sign off she used in her obituary

Meditation and a study of Buddist philosophy helped her accept what she couldn't change, she explained.

'At
any rate, I am at peace. And on that upbeat note, I take my mortal 
leave of this rollicking, revolving world - this sun, that moon, that 
walk around Green Lake, that stroll through the Pike Place Market, the 
memory of a child's hand in mine.'

Lotter took advantage of Washington State's Death With Dignity Act, however her husband told The New York Times that 'suicide was the opposite of how Jane saw her life.'

'She loved life. She just didn't want to end up like a fish flopping on a dock,' he said this week.

Towards the end of her obituary, Lotter wrote, poetically: 'I was given the gift of life, and now I have to give it back. This is hard. But I was a lucky woman, who led a lucky existence, and for this I am grateful.

'My beloved Bob, Tessa, and Riley. My beloved friends and family. How precious you all have been to me. Knowing and loving each one of you was the success story of my life. Metaphorically speaking, we will meet again, joyfully, on the other side.'

Signing off, the brave woman wrote: 'Beautiful day, happy to have been here.'
