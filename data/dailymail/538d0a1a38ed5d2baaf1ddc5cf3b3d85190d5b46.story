It smashed all book-selling records at the start of this year.

But just a few months on, EL James' raunchy 'mummy porn' trilogy is the last thing we want to find in our stockings on Christmas morning.

Fifty Shades of Grey is the most unpopular potential Christmas gift this year, with 26 per cent of people saying they would be seriously disappointed if they unwrapped it on 25 December, according to a survey by the British Heart Foundation.

More than a quarter of people said the publishing phenomenon would be their most unwanted gift, followed by the Olympics highlights DVD (24 per cent) and a weight loss DVD (20 per cent).

The recently fashionable 'onesie' item of clothing made fourth place, with 18 per cent of people saying they would not appreciate it as a gift, while just 7 per cent of those surveyed said the Christmas jumper would be their most unwanted present.

Two thirds of the 2,000 people surveyed (66 per cent) said they received at least one gift they did not want every Christmas.

According to the poll, those most likely to give unwanted gifts were grandparents, identified by 16 per cent of those surveyed, followed by mothers (14 per cent) and partners (10 per cent).

The BHF said its shops received a surge of candles, toiletries, clothing, accessories, books and DVDs after last Christmas.

BHF retail director Mike Taylor said: 'People spend a lot of money gifting friends and family at Christmas, but sometimes these presents aren't quite right.

'People often receive perfectly good gifts that are just not to their taste, are the wrong size, or even two of the same gift.

'We encourage people to donate these items to BHF shops so that unwanted Christmas gifts can help in the fight against heart disease.

'Whether it's a jumper that doesn't suit your taste, a CD that's not to your liking or a book you've already read, every donation will make a huge difference and help the BHF continue its life-saving work.'
