Cash-strapped Croydon has been named as the place in Britain where people are the most likely to worry over their spiralling levels of debt.

People in the south London suburb fret more about paying off loans and mortgages than anywhere else in the UK, according to a survey of 40,000 people by debt management firm PayPlan.

Nearby Redhill in Surrey is also in the top ten, as is Taunton in Somerset and Brighton in Sussex.

The Midlands features heavily, with Coventry, Nottingham, the Nottinghamshire town of Arnold, Nuneaton in Warwickshire, Margaret thatcher's birthplace of Grantham, Lincolnshire, and Northampton all appearing on the list.

Debt fear capital: Residents of Croydon are the biggest worriers about loans and mortgages in the UK

Jason Eaves, Payplan Director, said: 'We know that on average only one in six people with debt problems will seek help.

'Often these people feel isolated and alone and don’t know where to turn. What this map clearly shows is the scale of the problem throughout the UK.'

The research also found that the average debt level of people calling PayPlan is £83,465 – that adds up to over £3.4billion worth of debt.

'Right now we are being told that the 
economy is “out of intensive care” but there are still a few years ahead
where people will continue to struggle financially,' Mr Eaves added.

Grantham in Lincolnshire, the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, also features on the debt-worry top ten

He added: 'Many families have seen their budgets squeezed. Some parts of the country are in recovery while other parts are still in decline, but even in more affluent areas if wage increases have not matched the rising cost of living then debt is still a problem.

'Many people are struggling to make ends meet, so if mortgage rates rise and gas and electricity prices increase it will push many more people into problem debt.'

Although there are signs of growth in
the UK economy - Britain’s economic output expanded by 0.9 per cent in 
the first six months of the year - the situation for many ordinary working families remains bleak.

The problems facing families have been fuelled by a toxic combination of poor pay rises or pay freezes and rising household bills. Many have been forced to borrow to meet the rise in the cost of living.

The Office for National Statistics said recently the average annual increase for the whole of the last decade was just 1.3 per cent, the lowest figure since records began in 1948.

At this level, the average household’s spending money is rising at less than half the current rate of inflation, currently 2.8 per cent.

Household bills from the cost of keeping their home warm to the bill for filling up their car with petrol are going up, but families have little or no extra cash to cover the cost.

Meanwhile, a report from the National Children's Bureau found that around 3.6million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with just two million in the late 1960s.

Although house prices are slowly rising once more, property experts say it could take until 2021 to return to their pre-recession peak.

House prices have fallen by around 18 per cent in real terms  - but only three per cent in cash terms - since their peak in the summer of 2007.
