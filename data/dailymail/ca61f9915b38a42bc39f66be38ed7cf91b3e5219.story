Royal Mail shares could be worth more than £6 in a year, Goldman Sachs said yesterday – just weeks after the same bank told the Government they should only be  valued at £3.30.

Critics say it is now clear the price was far too low and that the taxpayer has lost out on millions as a result.

In a research report by the bank’s team of equity analysts, Goldman Sachs said its ‘target price’ for the shares in 12 months was £6.10.

Goldman Sachs said yesterday that Royal Mail shares could be valued at more than £6 within a year

This is nearly 85 per cent higher than the price at which Royal Mail was floated.

The news fuels growing fears that Royal Mail was sold cheap, ripping off the taxpayer.

Despite this, Goldman Sachs was paid £2.8million as joint global  co-ordinator of the sale, and is in line for an £800,000 ‘discretionary fee’.

The bank tried to lay the blame for the low share price on the threat of strikes from Royal Mail workers

Last night, Labour MP Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Commons business select committee, said: ‘The research report reinforces all the suspicions that the general public have about the way that Royal Mail was sold.’

He said it would be ‘completely wrong’ if the bank was paid the extra £800,000 – a decision yet to be made by Business Secretary Vince Cable.

Mr Bailey added: ‘It would be completely out of order to give them more money for getting something so comprehensively wrong and making money out of it.’

A director of the bank told MPs last week how it had valued Royal Mail at between £3billion and £3.75billion in its pitch to win its advisory role.

But the bank’s latest target price would have valued the former State monopoly at more than £6billion. Mr Bailey expressed his surprise this week at the decision to appoint Goldman Sachs, which has been involved in a long court case, accused of pricing the American firm eToys too cheaply when it was floated.

It agreed to a multi-million-dollar out-of-court settlement in September, but denies liability.

He said the decision to appoint Goldman Sachs for the Royal Mail sale was like asking Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs ‘to have an appointment with Securicor’.

During a grilling by MPs on the committee last week, the bank’s managing director, Richard Cormack, said: ‘I think, in the context, this was a well-executed transaction.’

He claimed it would have been impossible to sell 600million shares at current prices. Last night, they closed at £5.55.

During the hearing, the bank tried to lay most of the blame for the low share price on the threat of strikes over pay and conditions.

But no industrial action has taken place. The research note said: ‘We now view the near-term strike risk as relatively low.’

Goldman Sachs said the research team that wrote the note was ‘completely independent’ of the advisory division involved in the flotation.
