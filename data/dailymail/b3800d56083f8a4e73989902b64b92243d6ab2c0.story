A piano teacher has been jailed for 
secretly selling his frail elderly mother’s house to fund his  obsession
with a £7,000-a-session prostitute.

In a shocking betrayal, David Butler,
69, and call-girl Rachel Read forged the title deeds to the 
95-year-old’s home while she was still living there.

Butler, a lonely bachelor, had been a
respected musician who played the organ at his local church. But, after
meeting 39-year-old Read, ‘all he was interested in was drinking, 
gambling and sex’.

Callous: David Butler, pictured in the early 1970's, sold his mother's home so he could lavish money on prostitute Read (right)

His mother Margaret Butler, a 
great-grandmother with dementia, had no idea she no longer owned her 
three-bedroom home of 62 years until she was evicted and left homeless.

Butler had initially covered up his 
scam by leasing the house back from the new owner and living in it with 
his mother for two years. But he was so besotted with Read that he gave 
into her greedy demands for thousands of pounds for their sordid 
encounters, which went on for almost a decade.

After spending the £170,000 he 
pocketed from the fraudulent sale on the call-girl, Butler could not 
afford the rent. Before long, bailiffs arrived at the house in Bicester,
Oxfordshire, exposing his terrible deceit.

Read took so much money from him that she was able to drop all her other clients.

Margaret says that she does not remember too much of what happened, but is sad that her son has gone to prison

Vulnerable Margaret Butler is now being looked after by her other son Graham, who says that his brother was 'besotted wit the prostitute'

Eventually, Butler ended up an 
alcoholic living rough on the streets while she resided in a 
five-bedroom semi-detached house in Frilford, Oxfordshire, worth almost 
£500,000.

Judge Patrick Eccles jailed Butler 
for nine months, and Read for one year, and told them: ‘The word wicked is
not too strong to describe what you did.

David has been sentenced to nine months in jail for destroying his mother's life

‘It was done by you, David Butler, so 
you could get your hands on your mother’s money, and you, Rachel Read, 
so you could benefit because you knew he would give you all of his money
because he was besotted with you.’

He added she could only have acted ‘out of greed’ and her victim was left ‘destitute’.

Butler was supposed to be his 
mother’s live-in carer. He owned half of the property, where he taught 
piano and was an upstanding citizen. But that all changed when he 
started hiring Read, who advertised her services as an escort online, 
for sessions at the house in 2001.

He quickly fell in love with her and she demanded rising amounts of money in cheques before having sex with him.

Towards the end of their liaison, he 
handed her two cheques worth £13,000. That was after he sold the house 
in 2008 and pocketed his  mother’s £62,000 share.

Yesterday, as she was comforted by 
her older son  Graham, Mrs Butler said: ‘I did not want to leave. I miss
living in my own house.

‘David did an awful thing to me but I’m very old and don’t really 
remember what happened. But he is still my boy and I’m sad he is in 
prison. I don’t really want to say  anything bad about him.’

She is now living with Mr Butler, 74, as he took her in at his house, which is next-door to his former family home.

From there, he said: ‘David completely changed after he met this woman. All he was interested in was drinking, gambling and sex.

‘David and I used to be close. He used to be interested in books and he was a musician and played the organ at the church here for many years. Mum has lost everything – her home, all her money and her son to a whore who completely and utterly exploited him.’

Mr Butler said his brother told him about seeing a call-girl but he had no idea of the scam which had gone on next door.

‘He was very conceited and she knew how to play him,’ he added. ‘He was infatuated. He used to say he worshipped the ground she walked on.

‘He said, “I love her and we are going to get married”. He was obsessed with her but all she was after was money.’

Mr Butler told how bailiffs took his mother’s treasured belongings from her former home in early 2011.

‘She went out waving a stick  and it would have been a funny sight if it wasn’t just so sad,’ he said. ‘She loved that house. The sentences are too lenient. They destroyed her life.’

Butler and Read both denied forgery and acquiring or possessing criminal property but were convicted by a jury at Oxford Crown Court.

Read also denied a charge of fraud but was found guilty.
