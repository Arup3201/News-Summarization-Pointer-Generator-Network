It has been called the stuff of science fiction - a spray that can repel mud, water, oil, and liquids like chocolate sauce and mustard, from your clothes.

To find out whether the new product really works - and what effect it might have on your clothes - Matt Lauer took NeverWet for a test drive, spraying it on his suit pants in front of hundreds of Today fans.

Moments before he squirted chocolate sauce on the gray pants, the Today host commented that the treated spot was 'a little sticky,' before adding, 'and they dont smell so great.'

Does it really work? Matt Lauer took NeverWet for a test drive, spraying it on his suit pants in front of hundreds of Today fans

The $20 product, launching this week at Home Depot, is a superhydrophobic spray that actively repels liquids to protect everything
from your favorite cream dress to a pair of white sneakers from ever 
getting stained again.

'They say you can put anything on it and it'll slide right off,' said an excited Samantha Guthrie.

After applying two coats of NeverWet thirty minutes apart, as directed, the sprayed section left a darker spot on the host's pants.

Chocolate sauce was then poured over the
treated spot, and as the liquid slid right off the pants, Ms Guthrie 
exclaimed, 'Woo, it works!'

NeverWet to the test: The $20 product, launching this week at Home Depot, is a superhydrophobic spray that actively repels liquids to protect clothes, shoes, and even electronics

End result: As chocolate sauce was poured over the treated spot on Mr Lauer's pants, the liquid slid right off; Ms Guthrie exclaimed, 'Woo, it works!'

NeverWet was originally designed by Ross Technology, which was faced with the challenge of fixing rusting pipes under the sea, and set to work to 
find a substance that would coat and protect the metal.

Available to buy: The $20 product is available at Home Depot, and will soon be available at other U.S. stores

In
the course of their experimentation, they found the resulting 
substance - a silicone-based spray - could have infinite uses in the 
worlds of fashion, technology and engineering.

Not only is NeverWet, the first such 
consumer product to enter the market, impervious to any liquid 
substance, including oils, mud and condiments, but it actively deflects 
moisture leaving no trace whatsoever on its surface.

In a video released by the company, a
man in pristine white deck shoes - one coated in NeverWet, one simply 
plain canvas - jumps into a muddy puddle.

After swishing his feet around in the muck, he steps out to reveal the uncoated shoe covered in a thick layer of mud.

As
the NeverWet coated shoe emerges however, the mud shoots off the 
surface, leaving the canvas bone dry and completely unmarked.

In another demonstration, chocolate sauce is poured onto the coated shoe, which slips off leaving not a trace.

And on a treated white T-shirt, engine 
oil, apple sauce and orange juice form convex fluid globules that speed 
off the surface of the fabric.

Not only could footwear companies use
the coating to thoroughly waterproof their shoes, but a fabric with 
such effective repellant qualities could prove priceless to firms 
producing ski equipment, sailing and fishing gear or wet weather 
clothing, as well as being used as a protector for upholstery, 
tablecloths or napkins in restaurants.Â 

No more stains: NeverWet, the first such consumer product to enter the market, is impervious to any liquid substance, including oils, mud and condiments, and actively deflects moisture

Waterproof: In this demonstration, mustard is poured onto the coated shoe, which slips off leaving just a few beads behind, which then brush off

And its uses can extend beyond simple fabric treatment too.

Studies
have proven it is also efficient at completely waterproofing gadgets; 
protecting iPhones and iPods that previously would have been rendered 
useless after being submerged in water.

In an experiment by Ross Technology, an iPhone was left in a bowl of water for 30 minutes - and came out unscathed.

Stain free: On a treated white T-shirt, chocolate sauce forms convex fluid globules that speed off the surface of the fabric

Repelling soda: The coating could prove priceless to firms producing ski equipment, sailing and fishing gear or wet weather clothing, as well as being used as a protector for upholstery, tablecloths or napkins in restaurants

How it works: NeverWet creates microscopic nano-particles across the surface it coats, when liquids hit the superhydrophobic barrier, it forms a nearly circular bead that causes the liquid to shoot off the surface

This
so-called superhydrophic substance was developed only in the last 
decade as scientists tried to mimic the water-repellent properties of 
the Asian lotus plant.

Research found that, contrary to expectations, smooth surfaces actually encourage liquids to stick.

NeverWet creates microscopic nano-particles across the surface it coats. When
water hits the coating's superhydrophobic barrier, it forms a nearly 
circular bead that either causes the liquid to shoot off the surface or 
never cling there in the first place.

Magic: NeverWet, a superhydrophobic spray, actively repels liquids to protect everything from your favorite cream dress to a pair of white sneakers from ever getting stained again

Water damage no more: Studies have proved it is also efficient at completely waterproofing gadgets; protecting iPhones that previously would have been rendered useless after being submerged in water

Among other things, it can be used on metal, wood, masonry and aluminum as well as fabric, leather and canvas.

According to Ross Technology, applications of NeverWet can be as diverse as making toilet plungers water repellant so they attract less bacteria, forming anti-corrosive coatings on metal, and as an anti-icing device, protecting surfaces prone to freezing, such as aeroplanes, piping and electrical transmission lines.
