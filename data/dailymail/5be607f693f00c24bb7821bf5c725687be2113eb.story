An aging veteran has only one wish before he dies, to see the man who killed his brother 34 years ago brought to justice.

Robert Thompson, 83, of Baltimore, has become 'obsessed' with the murder of his brother Tommy Thompson July 27, 1981.

'This is my last chance. All my brothers are dead. I'm the only one who can do this because I'm the only one left,'' he said of the cold case.

Tommy Thomspon, 51, was found shot multiple times in his van after the unknown assailant entered the vehicle and forced him to drive, police say, according to the Baltimore Sun.

The victim, who was shot with a .22 handgun in the stomach, leg and head, had been going to pick up Chinese takeout in Baltimore's Charles Village neighborhood for dinner with his wife.

He had surgery to save his life, but died the next day, leaving behind four children.

Robert Thompson is now looking to find the man who killed his brother, who he was close to in their childhood.
