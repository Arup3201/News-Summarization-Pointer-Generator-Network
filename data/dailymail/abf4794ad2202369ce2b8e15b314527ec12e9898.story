This cheeky sea lion was clearly bored of the sea and decided to wander into an open-air swimming pool instead.

The brazen animal passed through the reception area and a cafe before plunging into the saltwater swimming pool in Dunedin, New Zealand.

'She was sitting outside the pool entrance from about 7am this morning,' said a surprised member of the St Clair Salt Water Pool staff.

The sea lion queued up for the pool to open, and then sauntered it's way to take an afternoon dip

'And then about 2.30pm decided to go for a stroll through the cafe, and then ended up in the pool.

'So she's having a nice free swim in the pool at the moment.'

Swimmers remained in the pool as the sea lion sunned herself by the toddlers' area originally, before making a quick exit when she dived in to do some laps.

It will have certainly given any holidaymakers something to tell the family on their return home. 

The sea lion was eventually coaxed out, but wanted to return after realising the game was nearly up

The pesky sea lion does not fear humans, and probably wanted to splash around with the crowds

New Zealand sea lions are known not to fear humans, so the tactics used were to clear the complex so as to make the animal lonely.

Devoid of company, the sea lion clambered out soon after, retracing its journey back out of the complex.

The sea lion taking a dip provided an unusual turn to the day for staff at he St Clair Salt Water Pool

Members of the public were soon told to leave the swimming pool when the sea lion jumped in

But realising it was all a devious plan, the animal tried to re-enter for another dip in the pool.

Speaking to the Otago Daily Times, Department of Conservation conservation services manager David Agnew said: 'It was quite hard case. We had to lock the doors. It was trying to get back in. It made a big mess with oil from its flippers on the windows.'
