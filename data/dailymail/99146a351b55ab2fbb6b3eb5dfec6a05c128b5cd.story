A popular Mexican food restaurant chain is being sued after waitresses at a Hawaii branch claimed the CEO and high level managers sexually harassed them and demanded sex.

Staff at the Senor Frog's bar and restaurant in Waikiki, which closed down in August, allege that male managers groped female workers' breasts and buttocks and demanded sex from them.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is suing La Rana Hawaii LLC, the Hawaii unit of Senor Frog's parent company, Grupo Anderson's.Â 

Lawsuit: Staff at the Senor Frog's restaurant in Honolulu, pictured, claim the company's CEO and other high level executives sexually harassed them

Papers filed by the agency filed to the federal court in Honolulu on Thursday accuse managers of making graphic, inappropriate and offensive sexual comments on a daily basis.

The allege employees were encouraged - with at least two claiming they were directed - to have sex with high level executives when they visited Honolulu, including the chain's CEO, named as David Krouham in the court papers.

They also accuse managers of routinely urged employees, many of whom were under legal drinking age, to drink alcohol with them.

The complaint names five managers and three senior executives.

Amrita Mallik, a senior trial attorney for the commission, said: 'One of the reasons we were so concerned about this case is we saw this harassing behavior permeated up to the most senior levels of management. That was a real problem and a real concern for us.'

'This was a company that seemed to disregard the rights of the women who worked there.'

Most of the nine alleged harassment victims were students in their teens and early 20s who were working at the restaurant in their first ever job while also studying.

Managers allegedly retaliated against them if they complained, by giving the workers fewer hours, fewer shifts, and assigning them to cover slower parts of the restaurant where they would earn fewer tips.

Senor Frog's opened its Waikiki restaurant in 2007 and closed it in August of this year.

A former employee first made the accusations to the commission in April 2008. The commission initially filed a complaint in December 2011 after attempts to negotiate a settlement failed. It filed an amended lawsuit Friday.

The complaint seeks lost wages, compensation and punitive damages as well as policy changes and staff training.

The lawsuit also names Altres Inc. - a Hawaii company Senor Frogs hired to handle payroll and paperwork.

It alleges at least four workers reported the harassment to Altres human resources staff as directed by the employee manual but Altres failed to take action and allowed the harassment to continue.

Altres CEO Barron Guss said Friday that it thoroughly investigated the one complaint it received and reported it back to Senor Frog's management.

Mr Guss said: 'It's not our role to come in and stop harassment and all those things. We can only report on what we find.'

Altres and Senor Frog's ended their contract at the end of 2008.

Senor Frog's were unavailable for comment. A phone call to Grupo Anderson's went unanswered. Most businesses in Mexico were closed Friday for a national holiday, Dia de Los Muertos.
