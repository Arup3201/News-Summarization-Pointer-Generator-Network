It could become the US Army's new 'superchopper' - able to transport troops, carry heavy goods and be fitted out as a flying gunship.

This futuristic helicopter from Texas firm AVX is the frontrunner to win a $100bn contract from the Pentagon for the next generation of attack helicopter.

It uses two rotors to create lift, while fans propel it forward to reach 230 knots.

The AVX chopper entry is what¿s called a compound coaxial helicopter. It has a pair of rotors spinning in opposite directions on top of the carbon-fiber fuselage to lift it, and two fans at its rear end to push it.

The AVX design is made up of
 counter rotating rotors on top and twin ducted-fans in the rear of the 
aircraft, which eliminates the necessity for a tail rotor.

The 
coaxial-rotors creates lift, while the fans provide forward thrust to 
reach the 230 knots require by the U.S. Army for the Blackhawk replacement.

The concept also has small
 wings in the front of the aircraft that create additional lift. 

'The AVX design offers the capabilities the Army wants for the future fleet of utility and attack aircraft at a very attractive price,' the firm, also called AVX, says.

'The AVX JMR aircraft has entry doors on both sides of the fuselage as well as a large rear ramp for easy cargo handling.

'Additionally it has retractable landing gear and the attack variant (see below) carries all armaments stored inside until needed which provides a “clean” aerodynamic design.

AVX has teamed with a number of experienced aerospace companies for development of the AVX JMR/FVL design.

'The teaming concept has allowed AVX to keep the cost of development and eventual production of the aircraft lower than those of other offerings while maintaining a high level of performance by the aircraft.'

The firm is among four vying for a $100bn contract for the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator, and the firms are expected to begin a 'flyoff' contest in 2017.

The AVX chopper will come in several configurations, carrying cargo, troops and the injured

With this signing, the Army has taken a large step toward developing a new family of aircraft referred to as.

'This is a critical risk reducing effort for the Future Vertical Lift Family of Systems,' said Maj. Gen. William Crosby, Program Executive Officer for Aviation.

'The operational benefits and changes will depend on the capabilities we can deliver to the war fighter with FVL.

'Improved speed, range, reliability, and survivability are critical goals that we will target.'

The AVX, which could replace the 
Blackhawk, is what's known as a compact coaxial-rotor/ducted-fan concept.

It is made up of
 counter rotating rotors on top and twin ducted-fans in the rear of the 
aircraft, which eliminates the necessity of a tail rotor.

The 
coaxial-rotors creates lift, while the fans provide forward thrust to 
reach the 230 knots require by the U.S. Army for the Blackhawk replacement.

The concept also has small
 wings in the front of the aircraft that create additional lift. 

The aircraft will weight 27,000lb (12,000kg), lift 13,000lb (5.900kg), and carry 12 combat troops plus 4 crew members.

The superchopper can also be fitted with advanced weapons and missile systems

According to DefenceTalk, the AVX design is the frontrunner for the contest.

'AVX’s coaxial-rotor/ducted-fan concept increases efficiency in all aspects of flight, while reducing vibration,' it said.

'Out of all JMR concepts presented by the competing parties, none look as complete, practical, futuristic, and ready as AVX’s aircraft.

'It is thrilling to see how new ideas broad by a startup aircraft company, few people ever heard before, will stack-up against the arrogance of the U.S. defense establishment.'
