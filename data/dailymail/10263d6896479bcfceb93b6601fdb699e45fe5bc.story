Airlines have today cancelled a further 5,753 flights with more cancellations expected as Superstorm Sandy continues to pummel the north-eastern U.S.

The massive storm has brought a near 
halt to air travel for a third day in a key region for both domestic and
international flights.

The total number of flights cancelled over the last three days now sits at just under 15,000.

Flight-tracking
service FlightAware reported cancellations by major carriers including 
American Airlines, United and Delta into and out of three area airports 
in New York, the nation's busiest airspace.

Some 50,000 stranded passengers
are now waiting out the storm across the world, in travel hubs 
including London, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong.

So
far, there have been 14,723 flight cancellations as a direct result of 
the storm. This breaks down as 1,300 cancelled on Sunday; at least 7,670
yesterday; and 5,753 today.

Sandy,
now rated as a 'post-tropical' superstorm, has forced the closure of 
JFK and LaGuardia airports in New York and Newark in New Jersey 'until 
further notice'.

Domestic and international flights have also been cancelled at other major airports in the north-east.

Both
Philadelphia International Airport and Baltimore Washington 
International Airport have warned passengers that most flights will 
likely be cancelled today.

Amtrak has cancelled all services in the north-east today due to high winds and heavy rain.

The
railroad said passenger service between Boston and Raleigh, North 
Carolina, and between the East Coast and Chicago, New Orleans and 
Florida will be suspended for a second day in a row.

Cancellations include Acela Express, Northeast Regional, Keystone and Shuttle service, among other trains.

Passengers
were urged to follow developments on Amtrak.com and Facebook and 
Twitter sites. No decision has yet been made on when service will be 
resumed.

Amtrak
said passengers who have paid but who didn't travel because of the 
service disruption can receive a refund or a voucher for future travel.

Businessman Alan 
Shrem was trying to return home to Boca Raton, Florida, yesterday morning, but
his Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to New York's Kennedy airport 
was cancelled.

He was told he 
could be stuck in Hong Kong for nearly a week because the next available
seat was on November 4. He was put on a waiting list for seats that could 
become available earlier.

'They
just say "Yeah, it's a pretty big waiting list,"' said Mr Shrem, throwing 
up his hands.

Meanwhile, he will have to pay $400 a night to stay 
at a nearby hotel. The airline will not pay for accommodation for 
stranded passengers if delays are weather related.

Air travel in the north-east began experiencing
problems on Sunday night, when passengers were reporting delays of hours at 
airline call centers.

Eileen
Merberg, 50, was booked on a United flight from her home in Rochester, 
New York, to New Orleans, connecting at Washington D.C.'s Dulles airport.

She
received an email saying the Washington flight was cancelled. United 
rebooked her first on a flight through Newark and, when that flight was 
also canceled, on another flight through Chicago.

By that point, she
had told the higher education conference that she was scheduled to 
speak at that she would not be coming. She tried to cancel her flight 
over the phone but waiting times were so long she could not get through.

Airlines are pointing to last year's Hurricane Irene as a precedent of likely 
action they will take.

During
a four-day period in August 2011, as Irene approached the Eastern 
Seaboard, 14,000 flights were halted as the hurricane traveled over 
major hubs such as Philadelphia, Newark and JFK airports.

Every
major airline in the U.S. has at least one hub or 'center city' and some, 
such as United (Newark and Washington Dulles) and US Airways 
(Philadelphia and Washington National), have two.

Even a slight disruption to one of these airports would affect thousands of flights and tens of thousands of passengers.

If
the flight cancellations continue, it could lead to havoc which would 
create gridlock in the U.S. aviation system and create a backlog of 
stranded passengers.

However, Sandy is expected to have remained in 
the area for at least 48 hours and disruption to flights is expected to 
be far greater than that experienced during Irene.

Every airline has issued a flexible travel policy that allows customers 
to make changes to their reservations with no penalty and passengers have been told to contact their carrier.
