Ed Miliband only discovered his grandfather died in a Nazi concentration camp six months ago, he revealed this morning.

The Labour leader said today's Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations were 'really emotional' for him and other Jewish families affected by the genocide.

He said his family had not talked much about the Holocaust growing up and had only discovered the truth about his grandfather after visiting Israel last year.

Labour leader Ed Miliband revealed the recent discovery of his grandfather's murder in an interview with BBC Five Live at their studios in Salford this morning

Mr Miliband, whose mother and father fled to Britain to escape the Nazis, said: 'It's 70 years since my grandfather died in one of the camps and I marked that about ten days ago.

'And you know, it's really hard this, because I talked to my mum about this: it's not the kind of thing you talked about very much when you're growing up in a household affected by these things, but it sort of marks you and it's so important that we remember.

'I think the theme of Holocaust Memorial Day this year is keep the memory alive. And as you say, Nicky, when there's prejudice around the world, when we see the rise of anti-Semitism, it's incredibly important that we keep that memory alive.'

He explained how he had only just found out about the circumstances surrounding his grandfather's death.

'I know this sounds almost unbelievable, but it's only about six months ago that we discovered the full circumstances of what happened to my grandfather.

'He ended up in Germany in a labour camp, which is where he eventually died according to the records. I went to Yad Vashem, the place in Israel where they have records on the Holocaust, and that's where we discovered more information about what had happened to him.'

Ed Miliband spoke emotionally about explaining to his children what had happened in the war. 

He revealed how he had to explain to his son Daniel why he was lighting a candle for his grandfather who had been murdered in a Nazi extermination camp.

He said: 'I lit the candle and my kids, my eldest son Daniel said to me "what's that for?" and he's five so it's hard to explain. 

'I explained it was my grandfather who I didn't meet and who died at a very young age.'

Mr Miliband said the experience of his family had made him realise both the horror and hope in people's treatment of Jews.

'It's awful and it makes me feel incredibly lucky. There's horror and there's hope, because it's also the case that many members of my family were saved because they were Jews who were hidden by decent people.

[There's another story, which is that there were 17 members of my family who were sheltered in a Belgian village – that's on my father's side – and it was only because of the decent people in that village who helped them.

'So I think this year and at all times, it's right to remember the horror, but it's also right to remember the hope and sense of optimism of what decent people did to save Jews.'

Mr Miliband's remarks come as about 300 Auschwitz survivors gathered at the site of the former Nazi death camp to mark the 70th anniversary of its liberation.

The commemoration will be held at the site in southern Poland where 1.1 million people, the vast majority Jews, were killed between 1940 and 1945.

It is expected to be the last major anniversary event that survivors are able to attend in considerable numbers.

Heads of state and representatives from wartime Allies will also be present.

Events include the laying of a wreath, a church service, and the lighting of candles at a memorial in the former death camp of Birkenau, which was part of the Auschwitz complex.

Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army of the Soviet Union on 27 January 1945. It opened as a museum in 1947.

Nick Clegg today backed a call for gay victims of the Holocaust to be remembered on a national memorial.

The Deputy Prime Minister told the gay magazine PinkNews he felt Holocaust memorials should include non-Jewish victims of the persecution, which included up to 15,000 homosexuals forced to wear a 'pink triangle' and live in concentration camps.

Several monuments across the world already commemorate the gay and lesbian victims, including in Tel Aviv, Amsterdam, Berlin and San Francisco.

The Liberal Democrat leader said: 'Today we remember the millions of innocent people who lost their lives in the Holocaust, one of the worst genocides known to man. Their crimes - nothing more than the way they were born.

'As we pay tribute to them, we must never forget the tens of thousands of gay people who were so brutally persecuted and executed at the hands of the Nazis, simply because of their sexuality.

'The symbol of the pink triangle, once intended as a badge of shame, today stands as an international symbol of freedom and pride. From the dark shadow of history rises a neon emblem of diversity and hope.

'Any memorial remembering the Holocaust should recognise the persecution of non-Jewish victims whilst maintaining the centrality of the six million murdered Jews.'

Benjamin Cohen, chief executive of PinkNews will say in an article to be published alongside Mr Clegg's: 'Last year, the Government announced the formation of the Holocaust Commission with a mission to create a permanent memorial to the Holocaust in Britain and increase the level of awareness of this important part of modern history.

'It's incumbent for the commission to ensure that the persecution of gay people is included in the memorial, perhaps with the inclusion of the pink triangle.'
