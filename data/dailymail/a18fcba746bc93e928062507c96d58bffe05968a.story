It is the ultimate rivalry in the golfing calendar, attracting thousands of fans dressed head-to-toe in garish outfits to signal their loyalties.

American supporters were seen roaming the grounds of Gleneagles today in their stars and stripes and oversized Uncle Sam hats to watch the clash of the golfing greats at the Ryder Cup.

And not to be outdone, dozens of Europeans were parading their deep blue outfits at the Perthshire course, accessorised with bright yellow knee-length socks and hats.

Twelve visiting fans from the Minneapolis dressed in Vikings NFL jerseys with helmets and golden pony tails and even  serenaded the US team with their own customised songs.

The 40th Ryder Cup got under way on Friday, with Europe looking to secure a third successive victory.

Golfing wives and girlfriends, now referred to as GWAGs, brought some style and glamour to the second day of the famous golfing tournament.

And Alex Salmond was spotted taking a 'selfie' with a fan in the crowd at the Scottish course.

The event was founded by seed merchant, Samuel Ryder, in 1927, although there had been two unofficial matches between British and American golfers beforehand.

Ryder wanted to get an official match with the best golfers in America squaring off against Great Britain's best and donated the trophy. 

The second day ended with Europe leading the United States by 10 to six.

Europe captain Paul McGinley: 'The guys were brave again today, but they produced again. It's been a great team performance. Collectively as a team everyone has pulled their weight and collectively we've come together.

'My job as captain is I'm half a day ahead of everyone else. I've had my idea of where we're going with the singles tomorrow and all afternoon I've been discussing it with my vice-captains. We'll discuss it with a few of the players. The eraser has been used a few times!'
