A taxi driver cheated death after thugs threw a 5ft wooden stake off a bridge which speared through his windscreen and missed his head by millimetres.

Mohammed Banaris and two passengers in the back were showered with glass as the post with nails in it came to rest on his shoulder. 

All were badly shaken but uninjured, and Mr Banaris managed to pull over safely after the missile was launched from a bridge over the busy A5009 in Abbey Hulton, Staffordshire. 

Lucky escape: Taxi driver Mohammed Banaris sits behind the wheel of his car, where he was sitting when a huge wooden stake thrown by thugs speared his windscreen and missed his head by mere milimetres

Missile: The stake came to rest of Mr Banaris's shoulder after it was thrown at his car from a bridge

Father of three Mr Banaris, 37, from Lightwood, Stoke-on-Trent, said yesterday: 'The plank just missed my head, it could have killed me.

'It had nails sticking out of it too.

'As I went past the bridge, bang, the piece of wood came straight through my windscreen.

'There was a man and woman in the back of the cab and we were all covered in shattered glass.

'Luckily, I was going about 30mph and there was no other traffic around. It was dark though so I didn't see anyone up on the bridge.

'There was a lot of shock. It's extremely lucky no-one was seriously hurt. I've been told a group of youths threw the wooden post.

Angry: Mr Banaris was unhurt but the missile broke his rear view mirror and smashed his windscreen, which must be repaired before he can work again

'My passengers lived in the area and they said they get young people chucking things down from the bridge all the time.

'The police said it's been happening for the last couple of months.

'It could have been so much worse. I have heard of people throwing stuff off the bridge before but I've never actually seen anything like that.'

The incident left Mr Banaris uninjured but with a broken rear view mirror as well as a smashed windscreen. He has been unable to work since the incident, which has left him badly shaken.

He added: 'The damage has cost a couple of hundred pounds but on top of that I missed the weekend shift which is always good for money.

'It's really frustrating because the windscreen won't be fixed until Wednesday so I won't be able to get back to work until the end of this week.'

A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'The wooden post shattered the windscreen of the taxi, which was travelling from Milton towards Northwood.

'It narrowly missed the driver and the occupants in the rear seats..

'There were no injuries but the passengers and the driver were clearly shaken.

'The local policing team are investigating and are appealing to anyone who may have information on the incident.'

Witness Graham Cayzer, who lives on Leek Road, said: 'The taxi pulled up in the lay-by adjacent to my house.

'There were three people stood around the vehicle and the police came.

'It's lucky the plank didn't catch the driver straight in the face.'

The bridge from which the stake was thrown: Just two days before the attack on Mr Banaris's car, a brick was thrown from the same spot and damaged another passing car. Now locals are calling for CCTV 

The dangerous act came just two days after a brick was thrown from the same bridge and damaged another passing car last Wednesday evening.

Residents living in the area are now calling for CCTV to be introduced. Paul Bate, 67, who also lives on Leek Road, said: 'I've lived here since 1985 and this sort of thing goes on.

'About three months ago, I saw a group of teenage girls throwing stones off the bridge, so I shouted at them and they ran off.

'This is the most serious incident of this type in my time here.

'It's tough to police, a lot of young people use the bridge as a shortcut from school, but CCTV cameras might help to catch the culprits.'
