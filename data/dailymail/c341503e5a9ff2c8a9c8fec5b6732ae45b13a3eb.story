The White House hosts the Easter Egg Roll every year on the lawn outside, inviting children and their parents to come and hunt for eggs, take part in sports activities and enjoy celebrity appearances.

Wozniacki was joined this year by actor Anthony Anderson and stock car racer Jeff Gordon. 

Although he wasn't particularly dressed for tennis, the President appeared to give a fairly good account of himself against the two-time US Open runner-up.
