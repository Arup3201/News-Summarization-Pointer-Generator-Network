These are the stunning images of everyday life taken by photographer Alex MacLean from his small Cessna plane hundreds of feet in the air.

The incredible aerial photography includes everything from sun-drenched bathers on an Italian beach, to technicolor fields of flowers in California and housing blocks in the arid Las Vegas desert.

Maclean, 66, takes the photographs from hundreds of feet in the air by sticking his camera out the cockpit window of his tiny Cessna 182 whenever he comes across a scene worth documenting.

Surreal: This photograph by Alex MacLean shows a large housing estate in the middle of the desert outside Las Vegas. The 66-year-old takes the photographs from hundreds of feet in the air by sticking his camera out the cockpit window of his tiny Cessna 182 plane

Stunning: This 1989 shot shows colorful flower fields near Carlsbad in California. Aerial photography is 'a lot easier than taking pictures from a car' according to MacLean

Technique: Hundreds of coal train cars are seen on the tracks in Norfolk, Virginia. MacLean says his plane normally flies itself level, even without the autopilot on, allowing him to focus on leaning out the cockpit window and taking the shot he wants

Sky high: This aerial view by Alex MacLean shows people swimming in a pool in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The photograph itself was taken in 2012

Repetition: This photograph shows dozens of homes set in neat lines on the Adobe Housing Development site in Las Vegas, Nevada

Bare: This snow-covered orchard was photographed last winter in Bolton, Massachusetts. The stark trees give the snow a peculiar looking texture from the air, almost like the image has been painted

Ripples: Alex MacLean was able to capture very artistic lines in this photograph of a beach in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. The deep green of the sea perfectly contrasts with the various shades of beige on the beach

In perspective: This aerial view shows ploughed strips in a field near the town of Gooyear in Arizona. Alex MacLean spends around 250 hours every year taking pictures

Maclean's
 stunning portfolio includes everyday human activities - seen from the 
clouds - like logging on rivers in Washington state, or shipyards in 
Maine.

Not even wildlife
 can escape his eye for a photograph, with one spectacular shot taken in
 Rosolina, Italy, showing a flock of pink flamingos mid-flight.

'It's a lot easier than taking pictures from a car,' said MacLean, who spends around 250 hours every year taking pictures from his small aircraft.

'My plane normally flies itself level, even without the autopilot on, so I can focus on leaning out and taking the shot I want.'

Feat: Photographer Alex MacLean (pictured) takes the stunning images from his tiny Cessna 182 while travelling hundreds of feet in the air

Lines: Hundreds of spectators' cars are seen parked at a Nascar event in Richmond, Virginia. Thanks to the angle from which MacLean takes his shots, even the must mundane objects appear abstract and surreal

Spectacular: Not even wildlife can escape MacLean's eye for a photograph, with this shot taken in Rosolina, Italy, showing a flock of pink flamingos mid-flight

Bright: Colorful shipping containers are seen in Portsmouth, Virginia. MacLean's photography career began with selling functional architectural and landscape images to universities, before deciding to focus on more aesthetically pleasing, artistic images

Patriotic: This photograph taken in Stow, Massachusetts shows a children's playground with a floor painted in the colours of an American flag next to a basketball court

Overlapping: This stunning aerial photograph shows interchanging flyovers near Albuquerque in the state of New Mexico

Scale: Thousands of logs look almost like matchsticks in this photograph taken above a commerical logging site in Olympia, Washington in 2005

Incoming: This well-lit photograph shows a wave pool in Orlando, Florida. The image was taken by MacLean in 1999

Incredible: This colourful image shows brightly decorated homes alongside medieval buildings on the island of Burano in northern Italy's Venetian Lagoon

Contrast: The wide expanse and freedom of the sea in Cape Cod, Massachusetts is in stark contract to the oyster cages in the centre of this photograph. Alex MacLean spends around 250 hours every year taking pictures from his small aircraft

Massachusetts-based MacLean has been taking photographs from planes since graduating from Harvard and gaining a pilot's license in 1975.

Thanks to the angle from which MacLean takes his shots, even the must mundane objects appear abstract and surreal.

Simple boats tethered in a Chicago dock, or spectators' cars parked at a Nascar event in Virginia, look almost as if they have been deliberately placed, such is the clarity and colour MacLean manages to capture.

This photograph of a boat yard in Newport, Virginia was taken in 2011.  Alex MacLean's aerial shots can make everyday images appear surreal and abstract

Spots: This image of boats in Tremont, Maine almost looks like a painting thanks to the solid background and the bright decoration and fairly even spacing of the boats

View: Alex MacLean's incredible aerial photography includes this shot of sun-drenched bathers on Spiagge Beach in Rosignano Marittimo, Italy

Abstract: Simple boats tethered in a Chicago 'daisy dock' (pictured) look almost as if they have been deliberately placed, such is the clarity and colour MacLean manages to capture

Complex: The bright and busy image is in fact an aerial view of the Ocean City Amusement Park in Ocean City, Maryland

Catching a wave: This perfectly-timed photograph by Alex MacLean shows seven surfers enjoying the water off Sunset Beach in Oahu, Hawaii

In his work, MacLean battles unpredictable weather and fights to take steady pictures over the vibration of the plane.

But he believes advances in technology during his 30-year career have definitely made some aspects easier.

'When I started out, there wasn't even auto focus,' he said.

'When
 you think of auto exposure, that's a big thing. Of course, the biggest 
change was transitioning to digital photography, which had lots of 
advantages,' MacLean added.
