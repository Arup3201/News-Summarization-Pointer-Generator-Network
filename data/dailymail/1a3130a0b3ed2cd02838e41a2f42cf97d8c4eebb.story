Some of the younger members of the Royal Family appeared to be enjoying the Christmas festivities as they larked around outside the annual church service at Sandringham.

Among those having a right Royal laugh was prankster Peter Phillips who took advantage of Prince William chatting with younger brother Harry to play a 'bunny ears' trick on his cousin.

Princess Anne's son Peter, 36, had a cheeky grin across his face as he crouched down behind the Prince, ready to pounce.

The young royals were clearly enjoying their time together, with Prince Harry also appearing to be the butt of jokes over his new facial hair.

As he joked with Harry and Peter, William appeared to be mocking his brother's bushy beard by stroking his chin while the trio stood outside St Mary Magdalene Church.

Harry
 returned from his trek across the South Pole with charity Walking With 
The Wounded sporting the thick ginger facial hair and today told crowd's
 outside Sandringham he was planning on keeping it as it was a 'Royal 
tradition'.

Harry debuted his beard on his return 
from the Arctic, where he joined injured soldiers for a race to the 
South Pole, although the race element of the challenge had to be 
abandoned due to poor weather.

He still had the beard for a trip to Cape Town last week, and seemed determined to keep it when he arrived at church today.

However, some suggested that the beard had been trimmed for Harry's festive outing.

All smiles: William and Harry seemed in good spirits as they left the Christmas Day service
