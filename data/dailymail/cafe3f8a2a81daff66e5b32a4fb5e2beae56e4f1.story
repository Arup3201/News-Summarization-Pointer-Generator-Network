Crimea has moved the clocks forward two hours instead of one in order to change to Moscow time, despite a U.N. vote this week declaring the region's referendum to join Russia invalid.

The move, which took place at midnight Moscow time - 8pm GMT - means the Ukrainian peninsula is no longer on the same time as the capital Kiev.

The Russian flag was flying high over the House of Officers of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, where the peninsula’s Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov oversaw the time switch.

Symbolically sealing Russia's takeover of the formerly Ukrainian peninsula, a ceremony was held to move the clocks two hours forward at the railway station in the main city of Simferopol.

Prime Minister Aksyonov oversaw the switch at 10pm to applause from hundreds of supporters who waved Russian flags and shouted ‘Russia’.

‘Only the first three days will be difficult,’ said Gleb Kulikov, a resident of Simferopol.

His friend Sergei Ageyev added: ‘We always lived according to Moscow time before Ukraine's independence.’

The time switch comes as it emerged Russia allegedly threatened several members of the U.N. ahead of the General Assembly’s vote declaring the Crimea referendum invalid.

Accusation: Russia allegedly tried to blackmail several smaller Eastern European and Asian countries, as well as a number of African states before the U.N. vote this week

Final vote: The Ukrainian resolution declaring the Crimean referendum invalid was backed by 100 U.N. states, with just 11 voting against

Before the vote, Russia allegedly 
tried to blackmail several smaller Eastern European and Asian countries,
 including Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, as well as a number of 
African states.

However, 
despite the supposed threats of retaliation, the United Nations General 
Assembly voted in favour of declaring Crimea’s referendum to break away 
from Ukraine invalid with 100 to 11.

The
 news of blackmail accusations comes as the leader of Ukraine’s 
opposition party UDAR (Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform), former
 boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, announced that will not be running 
for president.

 and will instead throw his support behind billionaire confectionary 
oligarch Petro Poroshenko and run for mayor of Kiev.

His
 endorsement will prove a valuable boost for Poroshenko, who played a 
prominent role in the months-long protest movement that led to the 
toppling of President Viktor Yanukovych in February.

‘The only way to win is by nominating a single candidate from the democratic ranks,’ Klitschko told a UDAR party congress today.

‘This should be a candidate with the greatest support from the people.’

Klitschko's
 withdrawal sets up a May 25 contest between the man known as the 
'Chocolate King' and former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko.

Out of the race: Vitali Klitschko has today announces that he is dropping out of the presidential campaign and will support Petro Poroshenko as presidential candidate in elections on 25 May

The disclosures about Russian threats 
came after Moscow accused Western countries of using ‘shameless 
pressure, up to the point of political blackmail and economic threats,’ 
in an attempt to coerce the United Nations' 193 member states to join it
 in supporting the non-binding resolution on the Ukraine crisis.

In
 the end, the Ukrainian resolution declaring Crimea's vote on March 16 
in favour of seceding from Ukraine as having ‘no validity’ passed with 
100 votes in favour, 11 against and 58 abstentions. Another 24 U.N. 
member states did not cast votes.

Western
 diplomats called the result a diplomatic success for Ukraine and said 
the result of Thursday's vote highlighted Russia's isolation on the 
issue of Crimea.

A spokesman
 for Russia's Mission to the U.N. denied that Moscow threatened any 
country with retaliation if it supported the resolution, saying: ‘We 
never threaten anyone. We just explain the situation.’

According to the diplomats, the Russian threats were not specific. But they said it was clear to the recipients of the warnings not to support the resolution that retaliatory measures could include steps such as expelling migrant workers from Russia, halting natural gas supplies or banning certain imports to Russia to cause economic harm.

Neither Kyrgyzstan nor Tajikistan were present to cast the vote, and the Moldovan Ambassador to the U.N. said he had not been present during any threats of relatiation, but said he had discussed the vote with representatives from several countries, including Russia.

Several diplomats told Reuters that Moldova was among the countries subjected to pressure from Moscow ahead of the vote. In the end, the Moldovan delegation defied Russia and joined Ukraine, the United States, the EU and other Western powers in voting yes.

French Ambassador Gerard Araud was asked about Russia's allegation that Western powers had blackmailed U.N. member states to secure a strong vote in favour of the Crimea text.

‘When you lose, you have to be a good a loser,’ he told reporters outside the Security Council.

‘I think Russia is a bad loser. They lost and they did by 100 votes.’
