The sight of Laura Robson on media duty with her wrist in a cast was a reminder of how tricky such injuries can be as Novak Djokovic pulled out of his favourite Wimbledon warm-up citing problems in the same area.

The exact extent of the world No 1’s discomfort remains unclear, but he withdrew from the Boodles tournament at Stoke Park as ‘a precaution’.

With Wimbledon starting on Monday, it means last year’s beaten finalist will open his campaign having not had any kind of preparatory match on grass after making the final of the French Open.

Worry: World number two Novak Djokovic was forced to withdraw in Stoke Park with a wrist injury

Fully fit: Andy Murray meanwhile beat Tommy Robredo at the BNP Paribas Tennis Classic in Fulham

The crowd at the Boodles event were told Djokovic had pulled out as ‘a precautionary measure ahead of Wimbledon next week’.

Djokovic (below) withdrew from the Madrid Open in early May due to soreness in his wrist and had a heavy schedule in playing three of the four weeks on clay after that.

While there is no suggestion he will have the same issues as Robson, the Stoke Park event has become an established part of his Wimbledon routine, so the decision to skip it is unlikely to have been haphazard.

Andy Murray will be pleased to have no such concerns and after last week’s third-round exit at Queen’s, he yesterday got in a useful exhibition match at the BNP Paribas Classic at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham.

The Wimbledon champion, with Amelie Mauresmo watching, defeated Spain’s Tommy Robredo 6-2, 7-6 and looked sharp overall, although he had to save five second-set points.

‘I feel good, my body feels better this year. It’s great to get a match and the court was very good,’ he said.

‘There was some high quality tennis. Tommy is a great guy to play because he has great intensity.’

Precaution: Djokovic's wrist injury is not believed to be serious but it has dented his Wimbledon preparation

Champion: Murray looked in top condition to defend his Wimbledon title with a 6-2, 7-6 win

Murray will learn of his prospective path back to what would be a third straight final when the draw is made this morning, although the one thing he knows is that he will open proceedings on Centre Court at 1pm on Monday.

‘A lot of players have spoken about it and how much of a  privilege it is,’ he said.

‘I’m sure there will be nerves and  pressure but I am going to try to enjoy it.’

Robson was an interested onlooker, knowing that her only contribution at  Wimbledon will be working on the BBC coverage.

Having undergone an operation on her left wrist in April she has ruled out playing until October and has her eye on a lower tier circuit event in Barnstaple for a possible return.

To try and speed recovery she has turned vegan and said that seeing some of her peers make major strides in her absence, such as Garbine Muguruza and Eugenie Bouchard, will spur her on.

‘It is a bit depressing because everybody is out there enjoying themselves, hitting the ball hard and competing,’ she said.

‘But in a way it motivates you. I have something to look forward to and can work hard because I know what I want to be doing at the end of it.’

Robson conceded she had tried to come back too quickly, hindered by getting so many different diagnoses. ‘It seems amazing that you can see seven surgeons who all say different things,’ she said.

It resulted in feeling helpless at times: ‘I think a low moment for anybody coming out of surgery is when the nurse has to put your clothes on for you, or being unable to cut a piece of meat, although now I’m vegan that doesn’t matter.’

When she does come back it could almost seem like an entirely new career: ‘I’ve got four to five years of experience behind me, so that is going to help, but I’m going to have virtually no ranking.’
