Wayne Rooney is poised to join an elite band of English footballers when he lines up for the Three Lions in Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier with Slovenia.

Just eight other players in England 142-year history have reached a century of caps - Peter Shilton, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Bobby Moore, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Bobby Charlton and Billy Wright - and it's only fitting to mark the landmark properly.

That's why Rooney returned to his old primary school, Our Lady and St Swithin’s Catholic Primary School in Liverpool, for an exclusive Sportsmail photoshoot.

The England captain posed with 99 schoolkids dressed in red and white replica shirts for a very special memento to mark the occasion.

Inspiration for the photoshoot came from two previous occasions on which England legends have reached their century.

Back in 1973, Moore posed with 99 boys from St Edward's Roman Catholic school opposite West Ham's Upton Park ground on the eve of his 100th England appearance.

Each of the pupils wore a cap, some borrowed because Moore had not been awarded one for every game.

And, inspired by that wonderful image, Sportsmail recreated the scene in November 2012 when Gerrard won his 100th cap.

Gerrard went back to his old school, Huyton-with-Roby Church of England primary, for a picture with pupils

The Liverpool midfielder went back to his old school, Huyton-with-Roby Church of England Primary, and sat amongst 99 kids each wearing one of his caps.

Gerrard said of his return: 'It was brilliant to go back. When I was walking around and getting ready for the picture, it put my whole career into perspective.

'I went there when I was only four years of age and I couldn't help but think where I was then and where I have got to now, on the verge of 100 caps.

'It put everything into perspective. I couldn't help thinking how well things have gone and how lucky I have been.

'I had so many happy memories of being in school and it was just nice to go back and see what it was like again. It was really poignant.
