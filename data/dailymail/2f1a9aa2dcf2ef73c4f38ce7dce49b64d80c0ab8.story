Just an average British girl: A photo of 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite taken from her fake South African passport released by Kenyan police

'White widow' Islamist Samantha Lewthwaite was just an average British girl who was 'empty in confidence', a councillor who knew her as a youngster has said.

But today suspicion is mounting that she was the ringleader behind a bloody massacre in a Kenyan shopping centre in which more than 60 unarmed victims have been slain.

And it has emerged that her frail 85-year-old grandmother has been admitted to hospital because of the stress of her granddaughter's notoriety.

Elizabeth Allen, from Banbridge, Co Down, was given a panic alarm to contact security services in case terror suspect Lewthwaite ever made contact.

Family friends say the pressure of the situation and Lewthwaite's now-global notoriety have taken their toll on the frail pensioner's health and mental well-being.

Joan Baird, a veteran Ulster Unionist councillor in Banbridge who knows the family, said: 'This is so distressing for everyone. Mrs Allen is 85 and she is in and out of hospital. It is just so distressing.

'Certainly, everybody in the town is shocked and distressed by the news.'

Lewthwaite from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who converted to Islam age 17, was married to Jermaine Lindsay before he blew himself up in the July 7 terror attacks in London in 2005, killing 26.

The 29-year-old mother of three is already wanted by Kenyan police over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country’s coast.

Now it is suspected that she was the mastermind behind the four-day gun and bomb attack on Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi, which has led to a continuing siege in which more than 60 people have lost their lives.

Born to English soldier Andy 
Lewthwaite - who met and married Irish Catholic Christine Allen while 
serving in Northern Ireland during the 1970s - she enjoyed an 
unremarkable childhood on Banbridge's Whyte Acres estate.

Lewthwaite was still at primary school when her family moved to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. In 1995 her parents split.

Councillor Raj Khan, whose family knew Lewthwaite’s family socially in Aylesbury, said he is surprised at speculation she is involved in the attack in Kenya due to how he remembers her.

'She was an average, British, young, 
ordinary girl. She had a very great personality. She didn’t have very 
good confidence,' he said.

After
 becoming a Muslim, Lewthwaite changed her name to Sherafiyah and 
married suicide bomber Lindsay, who she had met on an Islamic internet 
chatroom.

Mr Khan recalled a meeting with 
Lewthwaite and Lindsay regarding a housing issue which took place three 
or four weeks before the July 7 bombings, and he said she was just as he
 remembered her.

'Certainly when I was around her, she was the same person, lacking in confidence.

'She
 was not strong-headed. And that’s why I find it absolutely amazing that
 she is supposed to be the head of an international criminal terrorist 
organisation,' he said.

Mr Khan said he was 'perplexed' that 
someone he knew, who was so 'empty in confidence', was being linked to 
international terrorism.

He 
said he prays that she is not involved, adding: '...and of course my 
worry is that if she in involved, is she under some kind of duress? Is 
there other factors involved?

'Or indeed, is it Samantha? I mean there are so many questions to be answered at the moment before one can make a view.'

Mr Khan said her family will be 'very upset' if she is involved.

'Of
 course like anyone else, they will be very hurt, very upset, very, very
 upset, but I think they too will be waiting for proof, not 
speculation,' he said.

Suspicion
 that Lewthwaite was in the attack in Nairobi were raised after the 
Kenyan foreign minister claimed that a British woman who has has 
allegedly been involved in terrorism 'many times before' was among the 
militants.

Amina Mohamed 
said the woman acted alongside 'two or three' Americans as security 
forces began a fourth day of fighting at the shopping centre where at 
least six Britons are known to have died.

A British policeman has testified in Kenya in the trial of a Briton accused of plotting attacks and who has ties to al-Shabaab, the Somali group behind a weekend attack on the shopping mall.

Jermaine Grant (pictured below today in court), of East London, was arrested in December 2011 in a raid by Kenyan anti-terrorism police on his apartment in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, along with a female accomplice, Warda Breik, who police said was his wife.

Police said a third suspect, believed to be Samantha Lewthwaite, escaped in that raid.

Grant and Warda face charges of being found in possession of explosive material recovered from their apartment, and a conspiracy to commit a felony, charges they both deny.

Robert Garric, a detective constable with New Scotland Yard police, working in the forensic management team under the counter-terrorism command, told the court he had been part of a team deployed to assist Kenyan police.

Mr Garric said he and his team were told by Kenyan police that ‘they were looking at a plot to detonate explosives in parts of Kenya.’

He said he had been informed that a Briton, Grant, had been arrested using a false Canadian identity. The detectives were led to a government laboratory where they were conducting tests on chemicals recovered from Grant's apartment, Mr Garric said.

Mr Garric, a bomb scene examiner, manager and counter-terrorism investigator, said the kind of chemicals found, if mixed for a short time, could make explosives that ‘could detonate easily when exposed to shock or flame.’

Earlier this month, Grant was acquitted by a Nairobi court of robbery with violence, charges that could have carried the death penalty, but remained in custody because of the trial in Mombasa.

Prosecutor Jacob Ondari said three detectives from Scotland Yard were among his witnesses.

However
 there was confusion over Ms Mohamed’s comments - made while attending 
the United Nations General Assembly in New York - with no confirmation 
either from the authorities in Nairobi or the Foreign Office in London.

They
 directly contradict the Kenyan interior minister Joseph Ole Lenku who 
yesterday told a news conference that all the attackers were male - 
although he suggested that some may have been dressed as women.

The Foreign Office said only that it was aware of the foreign minister’s comments.

'We
 continue to liaise very closely with the Kenyan authorities and to 
support their investigation into this attack,' a spokesman said.

After
 her husband Lindsay detonated his suicide bomb at on a Piccadilly line 
tube train between King's Cross and Russell Square stations in 2005, 
Lewthwaite had told how she was horrified by the massacre.

But the Jamaican-born Muslim convert, who grew up in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, had never made a secret of his extremist views, alarming teachers by attempting to radicalise younger pupils.

In 2009 Lewthwaite disappeared with her three children but resurfaced two years later after travelling to Kenya on a false passport.

The Kenyan authorities issued a photograph of a white woman in a veil who they said was wanted for questioning about a bomb factory in the coastal resort of Mombassa. The woman was Lewthwaite.

It is understood she has had little contact with relatives in Northern Ireland since her conversion to Islam.

Mr Khan said he does not think the speculation surrounding Lewthwaite will cause divisions in Aylesbury due to the community’s maturity.

'Of course if it is Samantha indeed, of course they’ll be very hurt, very upset, as indeed any human being would be, but in terms of causing any differences in our community I think the community is far more mature for that kind of thing,' he said.

Stuart Osborne, who was until recently the Met's Head of Counter Terrorism Command, told ITV News that any role Lewthwaite has with Islamist militant group al-Shabaab is unclear.

He said: ‘Lewthwaite has obviously been involved in terrorism or connected with terrorists for some considerable time now. Her role in al-Shabaab is very unclear or even if she has a role within (it).

‘She is currently wanted by the Kenyan authorities in relation to an investigation for those who have committed acts of terrorism. But as yet she is untried and unconvicted for those offences.

‘Traditionally she would be seen to be somebody as a sympathiser, a facilitator or an instigator of terrorism.

‘She has certainly got a large media profile, certainly in the British media press in relation to her activities and her involvement in terrorist activities is still yet to be proven, but as I said she is still wanted for terrorist offences.’
