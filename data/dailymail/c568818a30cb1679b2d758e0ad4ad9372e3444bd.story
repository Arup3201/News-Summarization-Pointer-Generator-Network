All eyes may have been on 12-year-old Romeo Beckham in Burberry's Christmas advert but what about the other campaign star?

Romeo stars as a boy delivering the gift of love to a young couple, played by up-and-coming British models and dancers, Hannah Dodd and Anders Hayward.

The advert has lead to intense interest in Burberry's new golden girl, particularly as the quintessentially British brand has a history of catapulting young stars to international stardom (remember this is where Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Suki Waterhouse and Cara Delevingne all started).

Who's that girl? Hannah Dodd's appearance in the advert has catapulted her to the forefront of the fashion world so FEMAIL caught up with her to get the inside scoop on modelling's new golden girl

So who is Hannah and what do the brand have in store for her? FEMAIL met the 19-year-old drama student, from Leavenheath, near Sudbury, Suffolk, and with her modelling, acting and dancing skills, she's set for stardom. 

Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'I started when I was 15, a hair salon in the town where I live invited me to model for their shop - the photographer sent on the photos to Select and I was signed on the spot. It was very quick and very exciting.'

Hannah only secured her first major modelling assignment earlier this year as one of the faces of Primark's SS14 lingerie campaign - and now, as the star of Burberry's campaign, she is already being dubbed the new Cara Delevingne. 

Speaking about landing the role, which was choreographed by the world renowned Lynne Page and set to music composed by British musician Ed Harcourt, Hannah said: 'I couldn't believe it! 

'I was actually on holiday when my agent rang about the casting so I had to jump off the plane and go straight to Burberry when I got back. 

'I feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to work with such a lovely cast and crew and be part of the amazing Burberry family. 

'It took a week to shoot the film including rehearsals and I got to dance as well as model so it was the dream job for me.

'The cast and crew were lovely and Romeo Beckham is such a sweet kid - it was so much fun to work with them all.'

Talents: Hannah is studying for a degree in dance and theatre studies after honing her skills at Ormiston Sudbury Academy, where she took BTEC qualifications in performing arts and acting, as well as A-levels in dance and PE

And the young dancer is in extremely good company with Burberry, who recently unveiled Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne as the faces of the My Burberry fragrance campaign and Suki Waterhouse as the star of the beauty range.

Hannah attended a star-studded launch party at Burberry's flagship London store this week, which was attended by the Beckhams, and, unsurprisingly, admits she is still finding her success hard to take in. 

She added: 'The launch event was the first time we got to see the whole film through - it was so exciting.'

Catching the nation's attention: Romeo, 12, stole the spotlight as the star of the Burberry campaign. Hannah said he was a 'really sweet kid'

She also scooped the overall award for commitment to performing arts at the academy's annual 'Oscars'.

Ormiston Sudbury Academy principal, Caroline Wilson, said: 'I am delighted Hannah has continued with the same vein of success and professionalism as she did when she was a student here.

'She is a great source of inspiration to students and I am very proud to say that she was part of Ormiston Sudbury Academy.'

Luckily for Hannah, she says her agency have  been 'really understanding' as she is in full-time education so her time is limited.

Speaking about her plans for the future, she revealed: 'I am training to be a professional dancer.  

'Dancing has always been a passion of mine from a young age, I am training in ballet, contemporary, jazz and musical theatre, I think my favourite is musical theatre as I’d love to get in to acting too. When I'm not training I love catching up with my friends and watching movies.

'At the moment I'm focusing on finishing my degree but I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with modelling - I love modelling and being able to do the two things I love most: dance and model so the Burberry campaign was a dream come true.'
