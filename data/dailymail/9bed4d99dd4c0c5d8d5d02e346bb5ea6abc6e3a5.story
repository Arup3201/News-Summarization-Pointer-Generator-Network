Arrested: Mixed martial artist Jason 'Mayhem' Miller

A former UFC fighter and MTV reality show host was arrested after allegedly breaking into and vandalizing a church in California.

Jason 'Mayhem' Miller was in jail on suspicion of burglary 
last night after deputies responding to reports of a break-in said they 
found him naked inside the church.Â 

Miller was being held on $20,000 bail and was scheduled to appear in court tomorrow, Orange County jail records showed.

The pastor at Mission Hills Church in Mission Viejo called authorities when he found evidence of a break-in yesterday morning.

Books and CDs were strewn about, white powder was on the floors as well as missing boards from a previously broken window, sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said.

Deputies arrived and said they found Miller naked on a couch.

'When they asked him his name he responded Mayhem,' Mr Amormino told the Orange County Register.

They also found evidence that Miller had set off fire extinguishers inside the church, Amormino said.

Miller was coherent and cooperated with authorities as he was arrested.

Out: UFC president Dana White cut Miller

Deputies did not know if Miller had hired an attorney, and phone listings for Miller or a representative could not be found.

A message left on his official Facebook page was not immediately returned.

Miller, a popular professional middleweight in the mixed martial arts world, has fought for several organizations including UFC, but has lost three of eight fights.

He also hosted the MTV show Bully Beatdown a reality show where bullies are challenged to take on professional MMA fighters for a chance to win money.

Before his last fight on May 27, Miller said he would retire if he was defeated, and went on to lose a lackluster decision to C.B. Dollaway and was released.

UFC president Dana White said he cut Miller after 'some crazy s*** happened backstage' following the fight.

At the weekend Miller had an argument with Dana White on Twitter and told him 'kill yourself.'
