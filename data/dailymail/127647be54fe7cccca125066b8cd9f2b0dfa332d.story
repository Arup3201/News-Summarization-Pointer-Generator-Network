Significant delays are expected to continue across Brisbane's rail network after severe storm damage and flash flooding.

Up to 100mm of rain fell in less than hour in some parts of the city late on Wednesday afternoon, with the southwestern suburbs among the hardest hit.

Emergency services had received around 250 calls for assistance by 9.30pm - more than 90 from within the Brisbane city area.

'Some of the worst hit areas were Redbank Plains, Forest Lake, Inala and Springfield,' a Queensland Fire and Emergency Services spokeswoman told AAP.

Images posted on social media show cars being swept away in Bowen Hills, in inner Brisbane, as well as Chermside and Fortitude Valley. 

There were also pictures of water pouring into Post Office Square in the CBD, and through the roof of Toombul Shopping Centre.

Rescue teams were called to Rocklea and Salisbury amid reports people were trapped in flooded cars, but they managed to escape by the time crews arrived.

Fallen trees, powerlines and water over roads and rail lines caused chaos during peak-hour for commuters heading in and out of the CBD.
