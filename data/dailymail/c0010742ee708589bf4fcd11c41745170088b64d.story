She was born into the richest monarchy in the world, but Russia's last Romanov Grand Duchess ended her days in this unenviable semi in Toronto.

War and revolution drove Olga Alexandrovna, sister to Russia's Tsar Nicholas II, to flee her homeland and make way for the nascent Soviet Union while most of her family was executed.

The home, which is now for sale $539,000, was the final resting place where she died in 1960 at the age of 78.

Grand Duchess Olga was born into a world of unimaginable luxury and was given a 200-room mansion and a domestic staff of 70 by elder brother, then the world's richest royal.

She would have moved in the most rarefied circles of Russian - and world - society, and frequently accompanied the Tsar's family to events of state, such as those held in St Petersburg's world-famous Winter Palace.

But her life of imperial splendor came to an abrupt and bloody end after her brother's forced abdication in 1917 to make way for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik party, which would transform the Tsar's empire into the Soviet Union.

According to Nick Barisheff, whose family used to own the apartment where the Grand Duchess died, in her last year she stayed in bed and ate only ice cream,Canada's National Post reported.

She was driven to Canada via the Crimea, and then Denmark, where she and remaining Russian royals were hounded and killed by revolutionaries.

Eventually she took a ship to North America to get even further away from those who wanted her dead, and lived a humble existence alongside her second husband and their two children.

There she lived a life which hardly bears comparison to the grandeur of the imperial court, but occasionally received visitors from her past.

In 1959, the Post reported, her cousin Queen Elizabeth II of England, invited her aboard the royal yacht, Britannia, when she visited nearby Toronto.

Despite rumors of a vast, hidden fortune, Grand Duchess Olga reportedly only took a few trinkets with her across the Atlantic - though she was not even careful of those.

Barisheff said: 'The Grand Duchess had no financial sense whatsoever. When people visited her house in Cooksville and admired her stuff she would ask, "Do you like it? That’s your gift for today."’ 

'These could be things passed down from Catherine the Great.'

The property, which is now dilapidated and in need of repair, has served as a beauty salon, a travel agency and a religious building, as well as a royal residence.
