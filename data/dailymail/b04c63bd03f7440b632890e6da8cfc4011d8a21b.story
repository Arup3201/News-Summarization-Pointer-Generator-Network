CCTV of the post office robbery in Highcliffe. Detectives are now investigating the possibility that this man is also responsible for the armed kidnap of two people in the New Forest

A gun-toting kidnapper took two people hostage in less than a fortnight from the same village  and forced them into terrifying joyrides in their own cars.

Earlier this month, the gunman pounced on a driver as he parked his Porsche at a train station and nine days later he took a pensioner from her home, in New Forest, Hampshire subjecting her to a terrifying ordeal.

On both occasions he demanded cash and threatened to shoot before finally releasing his frightened passengers unharmed — but only after complaining about his failed business.

The
first attack happened at 6.30am on December 5 when a commuter was parking 
his Porsche 911 Carrera at the train station in Brockenhurst. The ordeal lasted about 15 minutes.

The robber — who had being laying in wait in nearby bushes — brandished the gun and ordered the man into the car. He took his keys and drove him to an HSBC bank where he forced him to withdraw a 'large' sum of money.

The
gunman then stole his victim's iPhone and dumped him in a car park 
before driving off in the Porsche alone. It was found abandoned by the 
side of a road.

Nine days 
later, on December 14, the gunman struck again — this time at the home 
of a 64-year-old woman and her husband, 70, in Lymington.

He kidnapped the woman and forced her into the passenger seat of her Peugeot 207 before taking her on a ten-minute drive.

Having
been convinced by his victim not to dump her in the Forest, he drove 
her back home, fled with £100 and dumped the car just yards away.

Police
have released a recording of the 999 call made by the husband while the
robber was in the house, in the hope somebody recognises his voice.

In it, the intruder can be heard 
saying: 'I'm going to leave you here, I'm going to take your wife... you
can ring the police in two minutes... We'll be round the corner.'

Detectives are also looking at the possibility the gunman is responsible for a robbery on a 
post office.

The kidnapper struck again ten days later, robbing an elderly couple in Lymington

The raider escaped with 
an undisclosed amount of money following the hold-up in front of 
shocked customers on Tuesday. The offender is described as white, in his 40s, around 6ft and of medium build.

Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Murray, from Hampshire Constabulary, said: 'We believe this man lives locally.

'He is someone whose life has fallen down around him and is facing exceptionally hard times.

'He has told his victims he lost his business and he has a wife and kids.'

Based on the conversations the man had 
with his victims, it is believed he is a married father whose business 
went bust five years ago.

Police warned people not to approach anybody matching the man's description and asked him to hand himself in.

The attacks have frightened people 
living in the New Forest, which covers 220 square miles and was the 
former hunting ground of King William I.

Resident Peter Young also said he is considering the security in his home: 'It's shocking that it's happened so close to us.

'We have taken every precaution but it doesn't mean we're not worried.'

And
Liz Black, who lives nearby, said: 'You are always hearing about 
burglaries at this time of the year but never armed robberies.

'I was surprised when I heard in was armed. It just doesn't happen here.'

Lymington
Mayor, Councillor Jacqui England, said: 'Nothing like this has ever 
happened around here before — it just illustrates the shocking times in 
which we live.

'I've been told about one household where the occupants are double-locking the doors. The person doing this is in a bad frame of mind. He's not just Mr Opportunist.'

Two men, aged 48 and 44, have been arrested and released on bail in connection with the kidnappings but nobody has been charged.

A third man, 44, remains in police custody today and is being questioned in connection with the three armed robberies.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
