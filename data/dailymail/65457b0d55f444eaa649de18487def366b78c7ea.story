The England football team may have enough money to snap up the latest designer gear, but as their latest photoshoot proves, you can still look a million dollars in a high street suit.

Players including captain Steven Gerrard, Chelsea's Ashley Cole and 
Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana have swapped their football boots for smart shoes to model the Three Lions' official World Cup suits - and both football and fashion fans will be pleased to know they can emulate the soccer stars' look for £199.

Designed
 by high street retailer Marks and Spencer, the suits, which will be worn
 by England manager Roy Hodgson and his players, come in charcoal grey and are packed with special design features.

These include an embroidered World Cup winners' star on the inside envelope 
pocket, the England crest on the Autograph label and a red, white and 
blue sleeve and pocket lining.

Styled up and looking slick in
 an exclusive photoshoot with men's magazine GQ, the 12 candidates for this 
summer's trip to Brazil showed off England's new look, which can be 
bought for £199 from stores throughout the country.

Created in-house by the design team, Marks & Spencer has worked with The FA to develop this exclusive ensemble.

The high street giant say they've sourced the finest British fabrics as well as tailor-making each suit to perfectly fit every player - only the best for our country's football heroes, after all.

The store say the suit is specially designed to be lightweight and comfortable to wear in the hot temperatures in Brazil. 

Made to measure: Every member of Roy Hodgson's squad will have a Marks and Spencer Autograph suit fitted to his exact measurements - and they're available to the public in a variety of styles

Suited and booted: England's players will swap their boots for black Gibson shoes when wearing their suits on World Cup duty

The grey Autograph suit is cut from light and breathable English wool and mohair fabric and is available to customers in regular, slim and 'Big and Tall' fit.

Fancy copying Ashley Cole's entire look? You can! The outfit also includes Gibson shoes and an Autograph tie, featuring a woven England crest on the inside tip.

Celebrating six years as official tailor to the England team, M&S has been supplying the squad with its formal wardrobe since 2007. 

A spokesperson said: 'We’re proud to be the official tailor to the England Football team and are delighted with the design of the new team suit. Made from lightweight British cloth and impeccably tailored, the suit is modern and relevant, representing the very best of British tailoring.'

Club England Managing Director Adrian Bevington added: 'With qualification secured to the World Cup, one of the most exciting parts of planning for the tournament is always the team suit and this has been no exception.

'We are delighted with what has been created for the team and staff to wear. The FA and Marks and Spencer have enjoyed a great relationship over six years, and that will continue next summer in Brazil.'

 Fashion 
writer Simon Glazin says: 'I can imagine men across the country 
furiously tapping their credit card numbers into the Marks and Spencer 
site right now buying this official World Cup suit.

'Men
 like to look to male celebs they can relate to 
and, let’s face it, what man doesn’t consider himself a professional 
football player? Now he can emulate his favourite player both on and off the 
pitch.

'This
 grey number would make a perfect addition to any man’s wardrobe, for 
work or play. Style it up with a pastel shirt, open at the neck, for a 
summer wedding, or wear it smart with cufflinks and tie for that 
all-important job interview.

'One
 thing’s for sure - get ready for men everywhere boasting that they are 
wearing the exact same thing the whole England squad own. How cool is 
that?'

Femail Contributing Editor Toni Jones says: 'The slim fit design is very cool right now, and looks great on a lean, athletic body. But how many men are as toned as the England football team?

'Frank, Stephen and the boys look super smart in their made-to-measure versions but real men splashing out on this two-piece need to be careful that the sharp cut doesn't end up looking a little lumpy.'
