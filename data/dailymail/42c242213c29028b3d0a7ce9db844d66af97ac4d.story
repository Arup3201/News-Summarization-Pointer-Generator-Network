Family, friends and classmates have gathered at the University of Southern California to mourn a Chinese graduate student who was beaten to death near campus in a robbery.

Hundreds attended a campus memorial service was held Friday for Xinran Ji. The engineering student was beaten with a baseball bat last week and left a trail of blood before dying in his off-campus apartment. Four teens have been charged with the killing.

Through an interpreter, Ji's parents said their only child had only a year left before graduating.

The dean of the USC School of Engineering announced a scholarship in Ji's honor.

Several representatives of the university spoke. Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni began the memorial.

'Today
 we gather in shock and in sadness to mourn the tragic death of our 
beloved student Xinran Ji who leaves behind a hole no one can fill,' he 
said.

'He was cruelly taken from us far too soon. And his passing has 
left us heartbroken, filled with confusion, anxiety and despair,' Soni 
continued.

'We ask ourselves, can there be a sorrow greater than this; a
 lament greater than that for a young life lost?'

Services were held in both English and Chinese, making it clear the grief spreads across both continents

The
 deputy consul general of the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles Lei Wang 
spoke urging USC and the L.A. Police Department to take 
further measures to ensure the safety of students.

About 300 people came to the University of Southern California the service.

An overflow of guests gathered around monitors set up in a courtyard outside the service at Newman Hall.

'An excellent student in engineering. He was recognized as an innovator and a future leader in his profession. It was clear, I am told, at a very early age, that Xinran would thrive in a field where technical and critical thinking could shine,' acting USC President and Provost Elizabeth Garrett said.

The dean of the USC School of Engineering, Yannis Yortsos, announced a scholarship in Ji’s honor, which would be awarded every year to a foreign student.

'Like all of you, I am devastated,' Yortsos said. 'So that out of Xinran’s senseless loss will grow the flower of hope and the seeds for a better world.'

Everyone stood silently as the parents and other family members of Xinran Ji entered. His parents, uncles and aunts flew in from China this week.

A poster-sized photo of the 24-year-old in a graduation cap and gown was on the stage next to a huge bouquet of white roses and lilies.

Each speaker bowed before the image and then turned and faced his parents, bowing deeply to them.

President of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association Xu Yuan spoke as if talking directly to the deceased Xinran Ji, saying, 'We want you to know we will take care of your mom and dad, so please rest peacefully.'

At Friday¿s memorial, services were held in both English and Chinese, making it clear the grief spreads across both continents

The electrical engineering student had graduated from Georgetown University with honors. He had the opportunity to return to his native China but instead wanted to come to USC, according to Ji¿s parents

t was a touching service that carried another message for law enforcement: plenty of people are counting on justice for a student who was taken from them much too soon

The words drawing the most emotional response came from a representative of the family.

An uncle read a message from the father who was sitting in the audience but felt he might not be able to make it through the speech.

It was a loving letter written from a father to his son. As the uncle read in Chinese, many of the Mandarin speakers in the auditorium started crying.

Also among those in the audience were half a dozen high school classmates of Xinran Ji,  all from inner Mongolia and all studying at different universities in the United States.

They flew in from Illinois, Ohio, Texas and elsewhere to be with the family.

Four people have been charged with capital murder in the slaying of Xinran Ji, 24

According to LAPD, the 24-year-old student was attacked by a group of teenagers outside his apartment last Thursday morning.

Prosecutors allege the suspects used a bat and wrench to beat up the electrical engineering student during a random robbery.

Two men, a 17-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl have been charged with capital murder in the slaying, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

The four teens are being held in county jail without bail.

Jonathan DelCarmen, 19, Andrew Garcia, 18, Alberto Ochoa, 17, and Alejandra Guerrero, 16, face murder charges with the special circumstance of murder during an attempted robbery, prosecutors said.

DelCarmen and Garcia are eligible for the death penalty. Ochoa and Guerrero, who were charged as adults, face life in prison without the possibility of parole. They are ineligible for the death penalty because they are under 18.

Daniel Dang, the family's attorney, is upset for his clients. He had a message for the university.

'If you do not do enough to ensure the safety of Chinese students, will have no choice but warn our parents not to send their kids to USC.'

According to Dang, Ji's parents last 
saw their son over Christmas in China. They hoped he would return over 
summer, but he decided otherwise.

When
 the university called them to inform them of their son's death they 
refused to believe it was true. It was only when the news was confirmed 
by the Chinese consulate that they made plans to come to the U.S.

Ji’s killing was the second deadly attack on USC graduate students from China during a botched robbery in as many years.

In
 2012, two 23-year-old graduate students, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, were shot
 to death as they sat in their car double-parked near the campus.

Bryan
 Barnes, 21, was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life in prison 
without the possibility of parole for the slaying. Javier Bolden, 21, is
 awaiting trial in connection with the killings.
