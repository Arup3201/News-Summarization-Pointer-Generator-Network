The Duchess of Cornwall looked like she meant business today as she attended a seminar at a Hackney school led by Apprentice star Nick Hewer.Â 

The royal power dressed in a flattering blue skirt suit with black heels and a snake skin clutch bag.

Camilla visited the City Academy in Hackney, east London, as part of her work as patron for the National Literacy Trust.

Smart: The Duchess of Cornwall visited a school in support of a scheme to boost literacy skills

She joined students taking part in "Words For Work" programme run by the charity to teach them business and communication skills.

The Duchess sat in on a question and answer session with Nick, who used to run his own PR company before becoming Lord Alan Sugar's right-hand man on The Apprentice.

Warm welcome: The Duchess was greeted by pupils on her arrival

Business talk: She then joined the panel quizzing Nick Hewer

Grilling: The royal asked the Apprentice star, 'what makes you laugh?'

The Countdown presenter was quizzed by a panel of teenagers while Camilla watched on about a range of issues including dealing with responsibilities.

He said: 'I've been an employee and I've run my own company. Your responsibility when you run your own company is looking after your employees. You feed them before you feed yourself. Your job is to go out there and win business and disperse it among the people that work for you - and hopefully make a profit.'

Camilla then chipped in with a question of her own asking Nick: 'What makes you laugh?'

He replied: 'I laugh very easily, humour is the bedrock of a happy life - I have a silly sense of humour.'

Power dressing: Camilla teamed her blue suit with a silk scarf and dragon fly brooch

Katie Blyth, 14, part of the panel quizzing Nick, said: 'I thought he gave us some really good answers and some good advice.'

Words For Work was created to meet the concerns of business chiefs who were worried about the lack of communication skills and work readiness among young people.

Under the scheme, business volunteers work alongside 13 to 14-year-olds, helping to raise their confidence and aspirations and give them the literacy skills they need to get a job.

Now in its fifth year, 2,500 children across England have taken part in the programme but the National Literacy Trust is appealing for business donors to help them reach their target of 10,000.

Nick, an ambassador for the Trust, praised the scheme. 'I thought the panel was very good, they worked as a team and asked sensible questions - but I don't know if I got the job,' he joked.

He added: 'They were good - the big thing is confidence. Kids are so unconfident and if they can be given those communication skills they can do well.'
