Sheriff Andrew Cubie said Etoundi, 29, had brought 'the law of the playground' into the athletes' village, while his behaviour 'undermines the concept of the friendly games'.

Defence lawyer David Hunter said Etoundi, who is originally from Cameroon, was 'bitterly, bitterly disappointed'. 

The Cameroon-born Etoundi had already been stripped of his games accreditation after being arrested.

Evans was fifth in the 62-kilogram (137-pound) division.

Etoundi overcame injuries to win a bronze medal in the 77kg class weightlifting on Monday. 

After his result he wrote on Facebook: '3rd lift 177kg C&J. Bronze medal! Thankyou to everyone for your support.'
