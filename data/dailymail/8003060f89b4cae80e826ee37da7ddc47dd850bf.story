Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate, blasted President Barack Obama on Saturday and demanded his removal from office.

The tea party speaking-circuit darling said at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado that talk of impeachment 'has got him nervous.'

Condemning the White House's response to a swarm of illegal immigrants cascading across the U.S.-Mexico border, she accused Obama of 'not
 defending [America's] borders and called it a 'dereliction of duty, violating the oath of office.'

'If that's not impeachable, then nothing is,' she said to generous applause. 'And if he's not 
impeachable, no one is.'

'Unaccompanied Alien Children': The Obama administration is straining under the weight of tens of thousands of uninvited border crossers, most of them children traveling without adults.

The White House has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in new funding to handle the humanitarian crisis, but has drawn the ire of Republicans by doing little to suggest a plan to secure the border

'No
 serious person can deny that team Obama has abused and violated the 
public trust and the Constitution,' Palin charged.

'The list of abuses, it goes on 
and on.'

In addition to immigration – 'amnesty' in conservative parlance – she rattled off a list of scandals including the mistreatment of veterans by VA health centers; a cover-up about the 2012 terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya; Justice Department spying on journalists, the IRS's alleged pattern of targeting conservative nonprofits for undue scrutiny; and the president's unilateral changes to his medical insurance overhaul law.

Obama, she said, is 'spinning from one scandal to another scandal. He has vertigo.'

'Even when crystal clear evidence stares him in the face, he lies and says there's no corruption at all.'

Palin showed her comfort with hyperbole, comparing his administration to an organized crime syndicate whose capo is insulated from responsibility by staying at arm's length from murder and mayhem.

Obama, she said, can't 'feign ignorance of all 
of this, any more than a mob boss can claim innocence because, well, "he 
didn't personally do the hit." The buck stops with the guy at the top.'

Saying Obama has fashioned himself more as 'a ruler, not a president,' she brought some to their feet by declaring that American colonists 'had a revolution in 1776 because we don't do kings.'

And playing to an event sponsored by the evangelical Colorado Christian University, she charged that 'it's an affront to God to let this go on, because He gave us [our] freedoms..'

'We're not going to let someone, a person, a party, take them 
from us,' she said. 'We're not going to dethrone God and substitute Him with someone
 who wants to play God.'

'Unaccompanied Alien Children': The Obama administration is straining under the weight of tens of thousands of uninvited border crossers, most of them children traveling without adults, and has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in new funding to handle the humanitarian crisis -- without outlining a plan to secure the border

Throughout, she referred back to the need for conservatives to have 'the guts to talk about impeachment.' And time and again she pushed the immigration hot-button.

'The Obama doctrine,' she said, 'is "break the law, get a reward." His incentives are invitations, and it's gonna get worse.'

Palin also alleged that the growing problem on America's southwest border isn't limited to the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have shown up and taxed federal government programs to their breaking point.

'It's not just the innocent children, she said. 'Open borders? Nothing is there to sift out the bad guys. The gang-bangers and terrorists, they will be mixed in there and we're offering to take care of them.'

'I think it's insane.'

'We're offering to strengthen them and we're going to be overrun,' she predicted.

'If Obama won't obey the law and secure the borders, then it's not immigration. It's invasion.'
