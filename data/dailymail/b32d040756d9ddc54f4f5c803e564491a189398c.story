A man who uses Twitter to encourage people to sign up as organ donors after a double transplant saved his life has been told he didn't deserve his new heart and lungs by cruel internet trolls.

Chris Richardson who was born with a congenital heart defect and left wheelchair bound, had a heart and lung transplant at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle five years ago.

But he has been left angered and upset after a vicious cyber bully attacked him for being overweight.

The female Twitter follower from America sent a disgusting message to Chris telling him that his weight makes him a letdown to his donor's family.

The spiteful message read: 'You are overweight and a disgrace to your donor. You do not deserve a transplant.'

Chris, of Walker, Newcastle, who has more than 1,000 Twitter followers, including celebrities such as Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle, has said that the message left him shocked and upset.

He has since blocked the sender on the social networking site.

He said: 'I could not believe what had been said.

'It was pathetic and I immediately blocked the bully from my Twitter page - I don't have that tweet anymore and don't know who sent it because I acted quickly.

'I use Twitter to try and encourage people to join the Organ Donor Register so I was shocked to see a message like this.

'I can't believe someone would say such a thing about my weight, especially when they don't even know me.'

But Chris's Twitter friends rallied round in support of the 28-year-old.

One friend said: 'Chris only you, your family and your real friends know what such an amazing, strong and inspirational person you are.'

His heart defect sadly meant that he spent most of his childhood in a wheelchair.

But he was given a new lease of life with the double transplant back in 2007.

Since then, Chris has had to take daily medication to prevent his body from rejecting his donor organs and requires steroid injections, which can cause weight gain.Â 

He added: 'I have to take steroids for my condition and that does cause an increase in weight.

'However, I do go to the gym and do what I can.

'There is no way that I am going to let this stop me from using Twitter in the future.'

Chris decided not to report the matter to the police, but a Northumbria Police spokesman said that officers take reports of cyber bullying seriously.

He added: 'The internet has become an invaluable resource for people of all ages.

'However, people need to be aware that what they say on sites such as Facebook and Twitter could cause distress and even get them into a lot of trouble.'
