Golden girl: Susanna Reid has been given a substantial pay packet for her upcoming role on Good Morning Britain

Poised, polished and posing in an eye-catching dress, Susanna Reid looks every inch the '£1million' breakfast television presenter.

But according to her predecessors, no one will be impressed with the extra added gloss. In fact they think Miss Reid’s alleged huge salary will prompt viewers to switch off altogether.

The comments came as the line-up for Good Morning Britain, ITV’s revamped breakfast show, was unveiled ahead of its launch next week.

Former BBC star Miss Reid will be joined by ITV stalwart Ben Shephard, and Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher from Sky News.

Now Nick Owen, who presented ITV’s Good Morning with Anne Diamond in the 1980s, has made a thinly veiled swipe at Miss Reid’s reported pay deal.

He told Radio Times: ‘I think all these announcements about high salaries alienate viewers. “Here’s someone on a million pounds – you will enjoy them!”

Who can relate to a presenter like that?’ Fiona Phillips, who presented GMTV with Eamonn Holmes, agreed with Owen, saying: ‘We weren’t out at premieres living the glamorous life. People don’t want to see that in the morning – they can’t relate.’

However, ITV told MailOnline on Tuesday : 'ITV are thrilled to 
have Susanna as part of the new Good Morning Britain team but the idea 
that she is being paid a salary in the region of one million is 
completely untrue. It is far off this.'

A similar big-money move from the BBC to ITV to launch the Daybreak show ended in tears for Christine Bleakley.

Viewers switched off in their droves and the programme was cancelled.

Miss Reid, 43, became a household name on the BBC Breakfast sofa and reached the final of Strictly Come Dancing last year.

It
 was reportedly this gruelling workload, together with having to commute
 to the BBC in Salford from her £1million London home, which led to her 
separation from partner Dominic Cotton, the father of her three sons.

Now it seems Miss Reid is hoping Good Morning Britain, based on the capital’s Southbank, will start a new chapter in her life.

Before Good Morning Britain: Susanna had previously played down reports she had been poached by ITV by saying she 'bleeds' BBC

She
 said: ‘I feel very lucky. I get to do the school run when a lot of 
working mums don’t get home until bed time. Of course I will bring this 
side of me to the programme but I do think as a journalist, you bring 
all of your experience.’

Susanna had previously played down reports she had been poached by ITV by saying she 'bleeds' BBC.

She said: 'If you cut me open I would bleed BBC.'

But after her move to Good Morning Britain was confirmed she took to her Twitter account to tell her 200,000 followers that she simply couldn't turn the chance down.

She said: 'As a news journalist & presenter I couldn't turn down this opportunity and a new challenge.

'Thank-you for your messages. I'm very excited to be joining Good Morning Britain. I have loved being at BBC Breakfast & will miss the team.'

As the co-host of BBC Breakfast, Susanna was the only woman on the sofa, but she will now have to share the limelight with Charlotte.

Charlotte took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to reveal she cannot wait to start working with Susanna, Ben and Sean.

She wrote: 'Thrilled to be working with @susannareid100 @benshephard @SeanFletcherTV #GoodMorningBritain #6daystogo (sic).'

Good Morning Britain launches at 6am on Monday 28 April.
