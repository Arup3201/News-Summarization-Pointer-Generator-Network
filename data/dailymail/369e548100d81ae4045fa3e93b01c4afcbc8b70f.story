A nine-year-old girl has escaped unharmed after a stolen Land Rover crashed into her house and threw her from a sofa.

Charlotte Jacob, from Netherfields, Middlesbrough, was watching television in her living room last night when the 4X4 careered off the road on the family's quiet residential estate and ploughed into the front of the property.

It smashed through the window and hit the sofa sending the schoolgirl flying across the room.

The 4X4 hit the sofa where Charlotte was sitting throwing her across the room but she escaped any serious injury

But miraculously Charlotte escaped serious injury and was treated for shock at the scene.

Two men were seen fleeing the vehicle and Cleveland Police say the car was stolen.

Charlotte's mother Senzeni, 35 and 
sister Charity, 16, were in the kitchen baking when the car hit the 
semi-detached house on Ingoldsby Road at around 7.20pm last night.

Her
father Trevor Jacob, 40, was working a night shift as a care support 
worker when Charity called him to tell him what had happened.

He said: 'I was very shocked when I got the call. I was glad everyone was OK but the house is really badly damaged.

'Charity told me Charlotte had been pushed about one metre along the floor on the sofa. She had been using the laptop and was sitting on the sofa when it happened.

'Charity was shaken by what had happened, but luckily no one was injured. The insurers have told us to ring a structural engineer today, so that's what we're doing.

'Apparently there were two men in the car and they just walked away from the scene. A neighbour who lives opposite saw it all, and said it looked like they lost control of the car and were trying to regain control when it smashed into the house.

Two men fled the vehicle following the crash and police said the Land Rover had been reported stolen

'The window was smashed, a radiator 
was ripped off the wall - we can't live in the house. I'm staying with 
my brother, but he's only got two bedrooms and there are four of us, so 
the insurers said we need to find temporary accommodation.'

The family have lived in the house since May last year and lived in Middlesbrough since 2007.

Trevor
said: 'We all still canâ€™t really believe what has happened. But at the 
moment I am just relieved that the children are OK.'A 25-year-old Middlesbrough man has been arrested but police are still searching for another male in connection with the incident.
