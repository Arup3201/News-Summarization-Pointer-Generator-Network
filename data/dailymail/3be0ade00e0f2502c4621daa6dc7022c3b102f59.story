The mother of a three-year-old girl killed instantly by a falling 5ft brick wall has said that ‘nothing will ever take away the pain’ of losing her - and that it’s still haunting to recall the heartbreaking incident.

Lindsay Burgess, 33, was walking along a road with Meg and her baby son in Meliden, North Wales, in July 2008 when the recently-built wall collapsed onto the pavement and crushed the little girl.

She desperately pulled the bricks away with the help of builders and dragged Meg from the rubble - but saw her fixed eyes, blue lips and broken body, realising there was no chance of resuscitation.

Mrs Burgess said: ‘Her eyes were 
fixed. I’ll never forget seeing her face like that. It haunts me. Her 
lips were blue and cold. I tried to resuscitate her but it was obvious 
there was no hope.

‘A large
part of me is frozen in time in that day,’ she told the Sunday Mirror. 
‘We’d never felt love like it until I had Meg. She was the most special 
child.'

Mrs
Burgess described watching the crash and said it was close to 
killing her as well as her son. She at first thought Meg would never 
walk again, but then realised her legs had burst and she was dead.

Last
week builder George Collier, 49, was jailed for two years over the bad 
workmanship that killed Meg four years ago, despite him earlier pleading
not guilty to manslaughter by gross negligence.

The worker had argued it was a garden wall rather than a retaining wall - but he had moved between 10 and 15 tons of earth and rubble behind it on the tragic day, which had led to the collapse.

Mrs Burgess now feels ‘some kind of justice has been done’ as someone was to blame for the death - and said the family want to work with the building industry to ensure nothing similar happens again.

She told the Sunday Mirror that it felt wrong to say 'something positive could come out of all this', but her daughter would have wanted her family to help others.

Her husband Pete, 31, said it ‘seemed things were perfect’ before the incident, after the couple had moved to North Wales and renovated an old stables, trying to build their own ‘fairytale’.

But he told the Sunday Mirror of the hours and days after the fatal incident: ‘The fairytale life had gone. I was the one who dressed her for the funeral, in her Snow White outfit.'

Mrs Burgess told a court last month: ‘I was walking along and she was trotting behind. She (Meg) was telling me we were going to make cakes when we got back. I turned around to look how beautiful she was.

‘She was about a couple of meters away from me. She looked up at me and it (the wall) all just came down. It all came down at one go, it engulfed her. Her head was the only thing not covered.’

Their son Wilson, who was aged 18 months 
at the time, has been a ‘comfort blanket’ to the couple, and they also 
now have a three-year-old son named Jackson, ex-photographer Mrs Burgess
said.
