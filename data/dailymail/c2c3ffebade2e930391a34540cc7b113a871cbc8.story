In 2000, Detroit was the 10th largest city in the U.S., with a population of 1.8million.

Today that figure stands at 700,000, and empty streets lined with vacant and abandoned homes serve as a glaring reminder of the painful decline the once-thriving city has witnessed over the intervening years.

Now a $1billion investment project that aims to transform Detroit's downtown area into a vibrant urban core is among efforts to revive the recession-hit city's flagging fortunes and restore it to its former glory.

A mortgage lender is behind the plans to turn the downtown area 
into a thriving hub that will act as a draw for the young 
graduates that have been 'fleeing the state'.

Over the past three years 
Quicken Loans, founded by Dan Gilbert, has invested 
$1billion and snapped up around 2.6million square feet of downtown commercial space.

The
firm's 7,000 employees have been relocated to the area, and it is in 
talks with between 80 and 100 retail outlets and restaurants about 
opening in downtown Detroit. Quicken has also invested in an 'incubator'
for technology start-ups, which now number 17.

Mr
Gilbert, who grew up in a Detroit suburb, has also joined up with other
business leaders to provide the majority of the capital for a 
$140million light rail line in the heart of the city.

'Young people are fleeing the state and we need to give them a reason to be here,' Mr Gilbert, 51, said in a recent interview.

He
wants to put an end to the exodus of educated young people Michigan has
witnessed over the past decade. The two University of Michigan 
graduates who founded daily deal marketer Groupon Inc - who left Detroit
to launch their start-up in Chicago - are just one example of the 
talent lost to the area in recent years.

Despite Mr Gilbert's investment in 
and vision for Detroit, not everybody in the city is entirely supportive
of his regeneration plan.

Some
critics have suggested the redevelopment of the downtown area - which 
is home to a largely white population and generally wealthier than 
Detroit's poor neighbourhoods - is creating an 'island of prosperity 
detached from the city's black residents, who make up 83 per cent of the
population.

'This is de facto racism,' said Pastor 
D. Alexander Bullock, a local leader of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH 
Coalition. 'There is clearly a plan to invest in the downtown area, but 
there has been no urban reinvestment in poor black neighborhoods.'

'We're focused on downtown - that's where we can make a difference,' Mr Gilbert has said.

While
the redevelopment is creating security jobs and other menial posts in 
the downtown area, the city's Mayor Dave Bing has said Detroit needs 
investment in retraining and educating workers who in the past held 
automotive or manufacturing jobs.

But
Mr Bing, who has slashed public spending in a bid to avert the state's 
takeover of the city's finances, nonetheless welcomes Quicken Loans' 
investment in the city.

'Downtown is coming back very strong, and that has been driven by the private sector,' he said.

The mayor has launched Detroit Future City, a planning blueprint that aims to revamp the city's economy and utilise empty space, making less populated neighbourhoods viable and repurposing land.

Sarah Brithinee, 26, is one young entrepreneur who now sees a 'land of opportunity' in her hometown.

Ms Brithinee, who returned to the city from Los Angeles in 2011, is chief executive of Wedit, which rents out digital cameras for wedding parties, then edits the footage into commemorative videos.

'I feel for the first time in my life I am making a real difference by coming back to Detroit,' she said.

Mr Gilbert's father and grandfather both owned businesses in Detroit before much of the city's white population began moving to the suburbs 80 years ago, where there were federal subsidies for land. That exodus accelerated after race riots in 1943 and 1968 and was compounded by the slow decline of automotive jobs.

On the walls of some of the office space Quicken has taken over in Detroit there are giant black and white reproductions of photos of the city in all its glory, a hustling, bustling city with a dynamic core.

For Elizabeth Rose those images are part of her childhood in the 1960s when her father worked as a mortgage banker in the First National Building downtown, a building Quicken Loans now owns.

Ms Rose runs the first branch of coffee emporium Roasting Plant outside New York on the ground floor.

'For me, coming back was all about Quicken Loans and the commitment they have made to Detroit," Rose said. "I wouldn't have come back if they weren't doing this.'
