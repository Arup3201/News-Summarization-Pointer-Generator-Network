Their diaries are stuffed with exclusive engagements – and their bank balances are almost as overflowing.

But according to the glamorous cast of ITV’s latest reality series, life isn’t as sweet as it sounds.

The six stars of Ladies of London claim their attractiveness actually makes it harder to succeed in a ‘man’s world’.

Ladies of London: Caroline Stanbury, Marissa Hermer, Juliet Angus, Caprice Bourret, Annabelle Neilson and Noelle Reno

The series follows the high society exploits of British socialites Annabelle Neilson and Caroline Stanbury and American expats Caprice Bourret, Juliet Angus, Marissa Hermer and Noelle Reno.

In the first episode, Miss Bourret – who classes herself as British – insists: ‘I find England still to be a man’s world. In this country, and especially if you’re good looking, it’s almost a detriment.’

The show was a hit when it was aired in the US earlier this year, and began on ITVBe last night. So just who are these ladies who lunch?

1. PRINCE ANDREW’S OLD FLAME

Caroline Stanbury, 38, was born into the Vestey family – worth an estimated £600million – and grew up hobnobbing with the royals.

She owns a 12,000 sq ft home on the Wentworth Estate in Surrey, where Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have stayed. It boasts a swimming pool and six or seven bedrooms – ‘I really haven’t counted’.

Miss Stanbury runs Gift Library, an elite gift service, and is married to investment banker Cem Habib, with whom she has a seven-year-old daughter and three-year-old twins. She is rumoured to have dated Prince Andrew, as well as Hugh Grant and footballer Ryan Giggs.

How she sees it: ‘British women can be quite stuck-up, but American women, it’s kind of drummed into them to be these Stepford wives.’

On her fellow ladies: ‘Noelle and her hat, totally unnecessary [at polo]. She looks totally out of place.’

2. THE QUEEN OF THE PARTY SCENE

Marissa Hermer, 32, is a director at Ignite Group, owned by her husband Matt. The group includes nightclub Boujis, a royal favourite. Mrs Hermer moved to London in 2008 and is known for lavish parties that feature in magazines such as Tatler. She has two young sons.

How she sees it: ‘A lot of society girls were not interested in me… [until] they found out my husband was Matt Hermer.’

On her fellow ladies: ‘When you go out with Juliet you buy tickets to the Juliet show.’

3. THE HOLLYWOOD SOCIALITE

Juliet Angus, 38, is a fashion PR consultant and aspiring TV personality. She has children aged four and two with husband Gregor, an advertising executive. The family, who employ a nanny and a make-up artist, moved to London from Hollywood three years ago, leaving behind friends including Leonardo DiCaprio and Lindsay Lohan.

How she sees it: ‘The Brits are so serious, I just wanted to turn to them and say lighten up.’

On her fellow ladies: ‘Noelle’s idea of a future husband is one with lots of money in his pocket.’

4. THE LINGERIE DESIGNER

Caprice Bourret, 42, is a model and businesswoman who owns lingerie company By Caprice. She moved to England from America in 1996 and now lives in London with her partner, multi-millionaire financier Ty Comfort, 45. She is believed to be worth £17million.

Last year Caprice gave birth to a son – less than a month after having a baby by a surrogate mother.

How she sees it: ‘No one goes to polo to watch polo. You go there to drink and socialise. Duh.’

On her fellow ladies: ‘Caroline is someone who will be so nice to you and then turn round and absolutely annihilate you.’

5. THE ROCK ’N’ ROLL ARISTOCRAT

Model Annabelle Neilson, 45, was the long-term muse and close friend of the late Alexander McQueen. She is from an aristocratic family and is the ex-wife of financier Nat Rothschild, while her former boyfriends include Lord Edward Spencer Churchill, son of the Duke of Marlborough. Miss Neilson, who describes herself as ‘more rock and roll than posh’, counts Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Richard Branson among her friends, lives in Chelsea and is worth an estimated £13million.

How she sees it: ‘The Americans are dressed like they’re going to have tea at Buckingham Palace, not the polo.’

On her fellow ladies: ‘The way I look at them is like three dogs. Juliet is an overexcited terrier, Noelle I see as a mutt you pick up from Battersea dogs home.

‘And Marissa is one of those pampered poodles with shaved stuff and little buns all over her. And she’s probably pink.’

6. THE WEALTHY FASHIONISTA

Noelle Reno, 30, is a former model and the co-founder of cashmere fashion brand Degrees of Freedom. She has also teamed up with fashion designer Zandra Rhodes for a clothing line called Z.

Miss Reno followed her ex-fiancé Matthew Mellon – who is Jimmy Choo founder Tamara Mellon’s ex-husband – to London at the age of 20 and decided to stay in the city, even when they broke up.

It was through Mr Mellon that she met current fiancé, former property tycoon Scot Young, who at the time of filming was in the midst of a bitter divorce battle with his ex-wife Michelle.

Miss Reno is worth an estimated £6million.

How she sees it: ‘We’ve been trying to marry for four years but hasn’t happened because of [Scot’s] divorce … I’m not going to wait around until I’m 35.’
