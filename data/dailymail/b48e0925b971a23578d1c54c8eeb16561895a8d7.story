Louis van Gaal has already told his new captain Wayne Rooney to calm down if he wants to become a great leader for Manchester United.

Van Gaal pulled Rooney aside after his first game as skipper against Valencia on Tuesday night and told him to ‘let it fly’ after becoming concerned the striker was trying too hard to prove himself worthy of the armband.

The Dutch manager does not want Rooney’s displays to become ragged and indicisplined through the pressures of office, and said: ‘After what I saw on Tuesday, I said to him “Maybe, it was too much for you as captain”.

‘I think he 
wanted to show the public absolutely everything — that he is Wayne 
Rooney, the new captain. So I said to him “Let it fly, let it fly” 
(relax and let it flow) because the most important thing is how he 
performs.

‘On our tour of America, he scored a lot of goals and made a great amount of assists. I want to see that Wayne.’

Despite a close relationship with Dutch skipper Robin van Persie, Van Gaal always planned to pick an Englishman to lead United.

He
 took his time before appointing Rooney last week and made it clear to 
the player that he expects him to represent the club as an ambassador. 
Rooney, 28, has been at the centre of gambling and womanising stories in
 the past.

Van
 Gaal confirmed: ‘I explained that it’s very important for me how a 
captain behaves off the pitch and he accepted the responsibility. He 
said he’d been captain before but I said “This is different. You are the
 official captain”.’

The
 new manager’s arrival will give Old Trafford a feelgood factor after 
last season’s dismal seventh-place finish under David Moyes.
