Valencia have agreed to sign Germany World Cup defender Shkodran Mustafi for £8million from  Serie A side Sampdoria on a five-year contract.

Mustafi, 22, part of Germany's triumphant squad at the World Cup finals in Brazil, will undergo a medical and be presented to the media on Thursday.

Mustafi, whose parents are Albanian, came through the youth academy at Bundesliga club Hamburg SV and had a stint at Everton, before joining Sampdoria in 2012.
