Gareth Southgate has revealed England will make another attempt to convince Aston Villa winger Jack Grealish to switch nationalities from the Republic of Ireland.

Grealish, who came off the bench against Manchester City on Saturday for his fifth appearance of the season, is set to play for Ireland’s Under 21s against Norway on Thursday.

The 19-year-old was born and lives in Birmingham but qualifies for Ireland through his father Kevin.

He has played for them at various youth levels and Ireland manager Martin O’ Neill was at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath base for the club’s Under-21 match against Bolton last week to keep tabs on him.

But Grealish could yet ultimately declare for England and Southgate confirmed he has the talent on his radar.

‘Jack is somebody we have spoken to over the years, him and his family,’ said the England Under-21s manager. ‘He has been in our younger development teams. The family and Jack are aware of our interest. Up to this point they have preferred to remain with Ireland.

‘I haven't spoken to him personally but certainly people from our organisation have kept in contract. We have been monitoring him but in the end it’s up to the player.

‘He's going to make his decision on where he wants to go. These things are quite fluid at younger ages, it happened with Michael Keane and his brother Will, and Jonathan Bond came from Wales.

‘More and more, because of the nature of society, there are players in our system who are duel nationality and have that choice to make.

‘Lots of other home nations are running development camps at a young age so players develop an allegiance quite young.

‘You are allowed to switch once when you are a young player and Jack is someone we are monitoring and we'll keep our eye on that situation.’
