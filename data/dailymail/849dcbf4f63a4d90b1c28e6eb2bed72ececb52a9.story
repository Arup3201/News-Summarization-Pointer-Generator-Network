Wild cats could be introduced into the UK countryside for the first time in 1,300 years, it emerged yesterday.

Experts want to release lynx, which prey mainly on deer, into woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Aberdeenshire as part of an ambitious ‘rewilding’ scheme.

Although the animals would be introduced onto privately owned estates, the woodland would be unfenced, meaning the 70lb animals could roam free around the countryside.

Scientists argue that introducing lynx will benefit the ecosystem, by helping control the 1million UK deer population, as well as boosting the tourist economy.

But the move is controversial and likely to be opposed by farmers worried about the animals savaging their livestock and game birds.

Under the plan, devised by the Lynx Trust, four to six cats would be released at each site.

Around the size of a large dog and with powerful claws for climbing, they will be released into areas rich in deer and trees and each will wear a tracking device so their movements can be monitored.

The Trust said it would be launching a public consultation this week, before applying to the Government via Natural England and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) for formal permission.

Paul O’Donoghue, a science adviser to the Lynx Trust, said: ‘The lynx is a magical animal that last roamed Great Britain [at least] 1,300 years ago.

‘It is one of the most beautiful cats on the planet and its absence makes Britain a poorer place.’

But a spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union said money could be better spent elsewhere.

‘We would be concerned about the reintroduction due to its high cost and failure risk,’ he said. ‘We believe budgets are better focused on developing existing biodiversity.’

While Ron Macdonald, policy director of SNH, who would have to licence the reintroduction, said they also had concerns.

‘There are pluses and minuses to reintroducing any species,’ he said. ‘Lynx could help reduce deer numbers in Scottish woodlands but some land-use organisations have concerns about the impact of a reintroduction on livestock.’
