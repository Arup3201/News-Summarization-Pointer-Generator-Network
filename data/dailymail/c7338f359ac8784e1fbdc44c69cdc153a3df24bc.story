After a wave of concept images that attempt to predict what Apple’s iPhone 6 will look like, it appears we've been given a glimpse of the real thing.

Images posted to Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn.

Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera, similar to those seen on the iPod touch.

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm.

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. 

By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm.

Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. 

Alternatively, the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of Apple's MP3 player.

Reports are claiming Apple is gearing up to go into mass production of the screen on its next flagship phone as early as next month.

The first image shows what appears to be a blueprint of the iPhone 6, while the other two images of prototype models are shown in silver with rounded edges - similar to those seen on last year’s iPad Air tablet.

Speculation is rife that Apple could follow up this super-thin tablet with an equally slim phone, dubbed iPhone Air, and the new images appear to corroborate this.

Earlier this month, Japanese magazine MacFan published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6C.

Earlier this month, Japanese magazine MacFan published drawings of what seemed to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6C, pictured. The drawings feature a flat, bezel-free device with rectangle-shaped volume controls like those found on the current iPhone 5C, as well as a camera with a single LED-flash on the rear

Recent concept images by designer Martin Hajek, pictured, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S

The drawings feature a flat, bezel-free device with rectangle-shaped volume controls like those found on the current iPhone 5C, as well as a camera with a single LED-flash on the rear.

Recent concept images were then created using the schematics detailed in MacFan’s release, by designer Martin Hajek, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni.

These concepts feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S.

The latest mockups come after Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP megapixels, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality.

It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures.

If Apple follows its usual release schedule, the new models will be unveiled in September this year, although experts are expecting the tech giant to launch at least one model in June. 

Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible.

But reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused Apple to delay production of the 5.5-inch versions.

It has been widely accepted Apple's rumoured 4.7-inch iPhone 6 (concept pictured left) will debut in September, with the 5.5-inch model launching in 2015. This was blamed on manufacturing problems. The latest reports, instead, are blaming this staggered release date on Apple's marketing strategy
