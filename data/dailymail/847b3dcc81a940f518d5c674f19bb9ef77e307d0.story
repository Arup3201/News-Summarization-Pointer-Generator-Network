Bernard Vann chose instead to enlist as a regular soldier rather than join the chaplaincy

He never forgot that he was a priest of God. 

So how did clergyman Bernard Vann reconcile his conscience with acts of war?

His story becomes the focus of a new BBC documentary which will be aired on BBC Radio tomorrow as part of the World War One at Home project to mark the First World War Centenary. 

Rev Richard Coles, vicar of St Mary's in Finedon, Northamptonshire, gave up his career as a pop star in The Communards to become a priest. 

He decided to go in search of the real Bernard Vann and discover why he swapped a prayer book for a rifle and what was it like for a man of god to kill on the battlefield. 

Vann was born in High Street South, in Rushden in 1887, and played football for Northampton Town before training for the priesthood.

He then went on to become chaplain of Wellingborough School. 

However, at the outbreak of war in August 1914, Vann chose instead to enlist as a regular soldier rather than face a delay to join the chaplaincy and was dispatched to France. 

Vann rose through the ranks in the 1/8 Sherwood Foresters, receiving the Military Cross as well as the Croix de Guerre. 

He was promoted to acting Lieutenant Colonel in October 1917, taking command for the 1/6 Sherwood Foresters.  

On September 29, 1918, Vann led the battalion across the St Quentin Canal, through dense fog and heavy fire.

The citation in the London Gazette adds that he 'rushed a field gun single handed and knocked out three of the detachment.'   

Four days later he was killed by a German sniper while preparing to lead another attack.  

Rev Coles, who went to Wellingborough School, said: 'When I started this I felt an affinity with him.

'He and I were both ordained. He and I both sang the same hymns and worshipped the same God in the same place in the school chapel. But then I began to feel the distance between us.

'I certainly wouldn't have the courage and stomach for the fight.

'If I'm honest I wouldn't have the relish and I'm wondering if Vann enjoyed his war-making more than I could imagine.'

Rev Coles visited Arras in northern France where Vann led his men.

Not only was Vann awarded the Military Cross twice, he was also awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for galintary which British forces can bestow. 

Rev Coles said: 'We are so used to the idea of clergy being mild figures.

'Meak and mild. But there is another version.

'The warrior Christian. Warriors for Christ. And Vann is very much in that category.' 

'In his pack he always carried a cup and communion.

'Once a priest always a priest.

He added: 'I don't think he could have asked for a more honorable death.

'That is a warrior's death.' 

When asked if he thought it would have been a difficult decision to fight on the front line, Rev Coles said: 'There would have been tensions.

'But he was convinced of the righteousness of this war and the British cause. In a way we might find difficult to imagine today.

'We do not know what it was like to have lived through the First World War.'

The documentary on Bernard Vann will be aired on BBC Radio Northampton and BBC Look East on Thursday February 27 as part of the BBC’s World War One At Home project.
