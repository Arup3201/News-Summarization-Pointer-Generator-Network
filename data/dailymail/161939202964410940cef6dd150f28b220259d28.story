Bacary Sagna is the fifth Arsenal player in five years to move to Manchester City. Sportsmail reviews the other transfers.

Emmanuel Adebayor - £25million - July 2009

Kolo Toure - £14million - July 2009

Gael Clichy - £7million - July 2011

Samir Nasri - £24million - August 2011

Total: £70million

In a club statement City announced their 'delight' at the capture of the defender who has won 41 caps for his country. 

The statement read: 'Manchester City are delighted to announce that Bacary Sagna will join the Club for next season.

'The 31-year-old full-back will complete his transfer from Arsenal on a three year contract following the World Cup in Brazil, where he is currently on duty with the French squad.

'Sagna is a hugely experienced defender, having represented Arsenal 213 times since joining  them from Auxerre in 2007. During that time he has picked up 41 caps for the French national side.

'France are in Group E of the World Cup, alongside Switzerland, Ecuador and Honduras. They begin their World Cup campaign against Honduras on Saturday.

'Sagna will join up with his new team-mates for the first time after the end of the World Cup, when the squad take in their tour to America.'

'He will take up the vacant squad number 3, the same number he wore for the Gunners.'

Sagna becomes the latest Gunner to move to City - following in the footsteps of Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir 
Nasri, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy.

With Clichy and Nasri still playing for the blue half of Manchester, the France international will be reunited with the duo as Manuel Pellegrini's side look to defend their league title next season.

Earlier
 in the week, Sagna thanked Arsenal and Arsene Wenger in another clear 
message that he was set to quit the club.

The
 full-back, part of France's squad at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, took
 to his Twitter and Instagram pages to post the lengthy message which signalled the end of his association with Arsenal.

Sagna, who played 231 times for Arsenal, finished his career at the club on a high with their 3-2 comeback victory against Hull City in the FA Cup final at Wembley in May.

A club statement from Arsenal read: 'Bacary Sagna has agreed to join Manchester City after his contract with Arsenal expires on June 30.

'Sagna, 31, signed for Arsenal from Auxerre in the summer of 2007 and went on to make a total of 284 appearances for the club.

'An integral part of Arsenal’s defence over the past seven seasons, the France international brought his time with the Gunners to a fitting close last month when he helped the team win the FA Cup in his final match.

'Everyone at Arsenal Football Club would like to thank Bacary for his fantastic contribution, and wish him all the best for the future.'

Meanwhile, City hope to finalise a deal for Porto midfielder Fernando once he has sorted out outstanding financial issues with the Portuguese side.
