Yellowstone National Park's Steamboat Geyser went off for the first time in eight years on Wednesday evening, drenching delighted visitors with its unexpected display.

The eruption went on for nine minutes from 7:30pm and blasted water and steam up to 300 feet in the air. The geyser continued to emit plumes of steam high into the sky throughout the night.

Steamboat is the most fickle of the Wyoming park's roughly 500 geysers, and no one knows when it's going to erupt next.

Holy grail: Among the park's rangers, Steamboat is the holy grail of geysers, its unpredictability making its eruptions highly anticipated

The park's most famous geyser, Old Faithful, is the antithesis of Steamboat, which is at once the world's tallest and least reliable geyser.

In 1969, Steamboat went off 29 times. Once, it stood quiet and silent for 50 years, lying dormant between 1911 and 1961. It can be months or years between blasts, making its eruptions highly anticipated.

Old Faithful, on the other hand, 
erupts predictably, 91 minutes after a blast longer than two-and-a-half 
minute blast, or 65 minutes after a blast shorter than two-and-a-half 
minutes, and has been called the most predictable geographical feature 
on Earth.

So why are the two geysers in the same park so different?

Lucky: Only around 30 to 40 visitors to the park were around to witness Steamboat shooting 300-foot columns of water and steam into the air

Scientists conducting studies with remote-sensing instruments that monitor underground activity still aren't sure what motivates Steamboat's eruptions.

'Most geysers are non-predictable,' Shaul Hurwitz told LiveScience.

'Those that are predictable, like Old Faithful, are quite rare.'

Geologists believe that geysers like Old Faithful have a narrow conduit that leads from an underground cavern. Before it erupts, water and steam gather in the cavern and when the pressure becomes too great, steam shoots water through the conduit and out into the air.

Geysers are hot springs that are characterized by their intermittent eruptions of water and steam. They are among the most rare natural phenomena on Earth. Geologic conditions, such as hot springs and volcanoes, must be present for geysers to exist. Most of the world's geysers are spread among five countries:

Park geologist Hank Heasler said that Yellowstone's geysers are fed by an underground plumbing network where the park's volcano heats the water and forces it to the surface.

So far, however, the force that decides that it's showtime for Steamboat has eluded geologists. They've tried to link Steamboat's eruptions to external forces, such as earthquakes, but no link has been evident.

'We are still searching for clues for what would make it behave as it [does],' Hurwitz said. 'As of now, we don't know.'

Steamboat's last blast was in 2005.

Park officials said only about 30 to 40 people saw Wednesday's eruption, who reported hearing a roar and feeling the ground shake before the eruption.

Robb Long, a freelance photographer from Sioux Falls, S.D., who witnessed the blast spoke to Fox News about the event.

'It was an amazing experience. This thing sounded like a locomotive,' Long said.

'Everybody was frantic, taking pictures. People were running down there trying to get to it before it went away, and park rangers were running around trying to gather up people so they didn't get too close.'

Steamboat Geyser erupted on Wednesday for the first time since 2005

@highlight

It's the tallest and least reliable of the world's geysers, half of which are in Yellowstone National Park

@highlight

Its eruptions are completely unpredictable

@highlight

It once went off 29 times in one year; another time it lay silent for half a century

@highlight

The eruption lasted nine minutes, but the geyser emitted plumes of steam for 24 hours afterwards
