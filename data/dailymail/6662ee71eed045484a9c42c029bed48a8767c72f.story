Manchester United were always masters of the late show. They were the team that never gave up until the final whistle, often scoring last-gasp goals that snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.

Under Sir Alex Ferguson, they made an art form of it, winning innumerable Premier League games, Cup ties and even the Champions League through their never-say-die spirit.

Opponents would always have that nagging doubt in the back of their minds as the clock ticked ever-more-slowly down. When would the onslaught come? Did they have the resolve to hold out?

But all that seems consigned to history - none of United's 13 goals this season have come after the 62 minute mark.

Radamel Falcao's winner against Everton on Sunday came just after the hour - but that is the latest they've scored so far this season.

By contrast, they have conceded eight goals beyond 62 minutes, including four at Leicester in the league and three at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

Louis van Gaal's team seem to have lost the knack of scoring late in games, something that is quite alarming considering their porous defence.

Compare this season to the last 10 under Sir Alex Ferguson - 468 goals were scored between minutes 0 and 62, while 296 came between minutes 63 and the final whistle.

So during Ferguson's last decade at Old Trafford, 38.7 per cent of goals came in the final 27 minutes of games plus that indefinite added period known as 'Fergie Time'. 

The late show reached its height in the 2009-2010 season when 39 of United's 86 Premier League goals - or 45 per cent - came after 63 minutes. 

United had even retained the knack of scoring late goals under David Moyes last season. It wasn't quite the dying seconds smash-and-grab raids of Ferguson's era but 21 of their 64 league goals came after 63 minutes.

Unless Van Gaal's fearsome front line can ensure every match is wrapped up by the hour mark, it is essential they rediscover that characteristic Man United ability to keep going until the bitter end.
