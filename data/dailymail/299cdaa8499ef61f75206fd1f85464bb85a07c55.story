The parents of a teenage boy who was scarred for life in a callous hit-and-run incident have released photos of his shocking injuries in a bid to track down the driver. 

Blake Bailey was walking with his 15-year-old girlfriend in Thurnscoe, near Burnley, when a car mounted the pavement and ploughed into the young couple.

The 16-year-old, from Bolton-upon-Dearne, was left with shattered bones and is still recovering at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

Shocking injuries: The 16-year-old, pictured left beofre the crash, was walking his girlfriend Jessica Green, 15, home in Thurnscoe, near Burnley, when the car ploughed into the young couple

He was left with a fractured pelvis, shoulder and knee and needed surgery to repair a deep wound running the entire length of his forehead. 

His girlfriend Jessica Green suffered less serious injuries.

Now his parents - who have remained at his beside since the collision - have released the images in the hope it will trigger calls to the police from people who may know the driver responsible. 

His father Michael, 40, said: 'We are devastated at what has happened and can't believe that anyone would crash into kids and leave them there. What kind of person would do that?

'Blake will have to live with these injuries for the rest of his life - every time he looks in a mirror the scar will be there as a permanent reminder and he's only 16.

'He is still in a lot of pain and asking how somebody could leave him and Jess.'

Blake's mother Michelle, 43, an NHS healthcare assistant, said: 'It's been terrible for the family, we are devastated. Blake is such a lovely lad, he would help anybody.

'We have had lots of support from family and friends but I just can't understand what's happened.

'All I'm asking for is to find who did it. Just come forward.'

The young couple were walking along Barrowfield Road, Thurnscoe, at around 10.10pm on Wednesday, September 17, when the incident took place. 

The vehicle, thought to be a dark-coloured small car, was travelling towards Goldthorpe at the time.

A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: 'The car may have sustained front end damage.

'Blake remains in hospital being treated for serious injuries including a head injury that required surgery as well as fractures to his leg, pelvis and shoulder.

'Jessica sustained minor injuries during the incident.

'Police are following a number of lines of inquiry but are keen to speak to anyone with information.'

Witnesses to the collision, or anyone with information about the car involved, should call South Yorkshire Police on 101 or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
