The fiancee of a man on trial for murdering a black teenager in cold blood has told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing.

Michael Dunn, 47, is accused of murdering Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old, after he refused to turn down loud rap music he and his friends were playing in his car parked outside a store in Jacksonville, Florida.

Rhonda Rouer, who was inside the store when the shooting happened, said she heard shots and was immediately told to get in the car by Dunn, who drove them back to their hotel.

The couple then ordered a meal, made drinks and went to bed. Dunn was arrested the following morning.

The shooting - which nobody denies led to Davis's death - happened after a shouting match between Dunn and the group of teenagers in the car.

Dunn is accused of firing 10 times into the SUV, including several times as the driver tried to get away. One of the shots killed Davis. No one else in the SUV was injured.

Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Guy said Dunn fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' while the defense said it happened because he felt in imminent danger. 

Michael Dunn, 47, (left) is on trial for a second time, charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 killing of Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Georgia

He has already been convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder and is facing 60 years in prison. Dunn is facing a retrial on the first-degree murder count after the jury deadlocked at the previous trial in February.

Giving her testimony, Rouer said that she was buying chips and wine in the convenience store when she 'heard a pop, pop, pop'. 

She said she didn't know what was going on until she went outside and her fiancee Michael Dunn urged her to get into the car, then drove off quickly, before she could fasten her seatbelt.

Rouer repeated testimony she gave in the first trial, saying the couple, who live together, went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes, then she fell asleep.

The next morning when she woke up, the TV was on and she said she saw that Davis had died and she told Dunn she wanted to go home. They drove straight back to Satellite Beach, canceling plans to have lunch with Dunn's son. Dunn was arrested after they returned home that afternoon.

The prosecution spent a third day laying out its case that Dunn acted in cold blood when he killed Davis, who was sitting in the rear passenger seat of an SUV next to Dunn's car

Dunn, who had just left his son's wedding, asked Davis and the other teens in the car to turn down the music and a shouting match erupted between Dunn and Davis. 

The trial was halted briefly Saturday when a juror was dismissed.

The dismissal followed a column posted online by Jacksonville alternative publication Folio Weekly that quoted a one-time prospective juror who was not picked after he said he had written for the publication. Richard David Smith III told the publication that the juror who was picked had questioned State Attorney Angela Corey's competence during jury selection and complained about her sense of humor.

Judge Russell Healey, Corey and other attorneys involved in the case questioned the columnist and Smith.

One of four alternate jurors will replace the dismissed juror.
