A cold-blooded ice-cream parlour owner dubbed the 
'ice lady' for the calculated way in which she killed her ex-husband and
lover was sentenced to life in a secure mental institution yesterday.

Estibaliz
Carranza, 34, had confessed to shooting the two men at close range in 
the back of the head, cutting up their bodies with a chainsaw, freezing 
them in a deep freeze and later interring them in concrete under the 
cellar of her store.

Judge 
Susanne Lehr told a Vienna court her confession and her state of 
'considerable psychological damage' were mitigating factors, but her 
careful planning and her behaviour after the murders counted against 
her.

Ice cream seller Carranza was described as 'singularly cold-blooded' in court

Carranza,
wearing the same grey dress she had worn throughout the four-day trial 
and donning a pair of glasses, did not react to the unanimous jury 
verdict and nodded to confirm she had understood the sentence.

Her
lawyer Rudolf Mayer - who also defended Josef Fritzl, who used his daughter as a sex 
slave - said he would appeal to have the verdict overturned.

The
photogenic Mexican-Spanish immigrant, whose case has attracted 
extensive interest from Austrian media, shot dead her German ex-husband 
Holger Holz with a .22-calibre Beretta pistol in 2008 as he sat as his 
computer.

Carranza
said he had completely changed after their wedding, turning verbally 
abusive, lazy and joining a Hare Krishna sect.

She complained that he 
had refused to move out when she had a new lover, even after their 
divorce.

The new lover, 
ice-cream machine salesman Manfred Hinterberger, suffered the same fate 
two years later, receiving four shots in the back of the head as he lay 
in bed snoring after she had tried to start a discussion about his 
infidelity.

Carranza had 
taken courses in shooting and concrete-mixing before the killings, the 
court heard this week, and joked with a friend about her murder 
fantasies.

On Thursday, Carranza wept as she told the judge: 'All I can say is that I'm sorry I took the lives of Holger and Manfred.'

Earlier,
prosecutor Petra Freh told the court Carranza was a manipulative liar 
prepared to do anything for her own advantage, according to the Austria 
Press Agency.

Psychiatrist 
Heidi Kastner, who spent more than 30 hours with Carranza before the 
trial, said the murderer had a 'grave, comprehensive, multi-faceted 
personality disorder' and was at considerable risk of killing again if 
she did not have therapy.

Kastner
was also the expert psychiatric prosecution witness in the 2009 Fritzl 
case, spending four months with him before the trial that ended in his 
conviction for rape, incest, kidnapping and enslavement of his daughter 
over 24 years.

The remains 
of Carranza's victims were found by chance last year when maintenance 
work was being done in the building where she had buried them.
