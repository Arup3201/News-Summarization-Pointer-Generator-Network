After more than five years away from television, Judy Finnigan returned to our screens yesterday – and stepped straight into controversy.

The veteran broadcaster sparked fury during her debut as a Loose Women panellist when she suggested a convicted rapist footballer should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was ‘drunk’ and the rape was ‘unpleasant’ but ‘not violent’.

But after a huge public backlash in which hundreds complained online about the ‘disgusting’ and ‘damaging’ remarks, she was eventually forced to ‘apologise unreservedly’ for the offence she had caused.

Judy Finnigan has provoked outrage after suggesting that a convicted rapist footballer should be allowed back to his club, because the attack 'wasn't violent and the victim was drunk'. She said: 'He didn't cause any bodily harm to the person'

Speaking on her Loose Women debut, the veteran broadcaster was discussing allowing rapist Ched Evans to return to play for his former club Sheffield United 

Her comments came during a discussion on the ITV lunchtime chat show about whether disgraced footballer Ched Evans should be allowed to return to Sheffield United.

The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire, but will be released from jail within days. So far his former club, which cancelled his contract, has refused to comment on whether he will be offered a new one.

But on the show, Miss Finnigan – who presented ITV’s This Morning with husband Richard Madeley from 1988 to 2001 – said: ‘He’s served his time. The rape – and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent. He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person.

Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence. More than 100,000 people have signed petition to prevent Evans from returning to play

‘It was unpleasant, in a hotel room, I believe, and she was – she had far too much to drink. And you know, that is reprehensible, but he has been convicted and he has served his time. Now when he comes out, what are we supposed to do? Just actually refuse to let him do his job even though he has already been punished?’

But before the programme had even finished, hundreds of viewers had taken to social media to express their outrage.

Women’s rights campaigner Jean Hatchet – who has set up a petition calling for Evans to be banned – told the Daily Mail she was ‘stunned’ by Miss Finnigan’s comments, adding: ‘Drunk women don’t cause rape. Rapists do. 

'Evans had sex with a woman without her consent. That is a violent act. [Miss Finnigan] is guilty of such internalised misogyny that I don’t think she was even aware of how hurtful and damaging her comments were.’

Hundreds of viewers also expressed their anger on Twitter. Last night Miss Finnigan, 66, said: ‘I absolutely wasn’t suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and, as I said on the programme, I was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result.

‘The point I was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time? I apologise unreservedly for any offence that I may have caused as a result of the wording I used.’

Broadcasting regulator Ofcom said that it had received one complaint about Miss Finnigan’s comments. ITV said it had received no formal complaints.  

The former Richard & Judy star was signed up to join the show as a regular panellist in an effort to stop a fall in viewing figures - despite vowing to never return to television

As they were: Ms Finnigan made her name as one half of Richard&Judy. The couple, who wed in 1986, worked together side by side for two decades

A petition urging Sheffield United not to reinstate Ched Evans once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people.

So far the club, which signed Evans for £3million in 2009, has refused to say whether it will take him back.

Women’s rights campaigner Jean Hatchet set up the petition on the website Change.org, calling on the club’s chairman Kevin McCabe and part-owner Prince Abdullah Bin Musa’ad Bin Abdul Aziz to make it clear that Evans – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome.

In an open letter to the pair, she said: ‘I’m sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before. Unfortunately, he still hasn’t acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd resign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans.

‘They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.’

During the trial in 2012, Evans admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, but denied rape.

Evans’ girlfriend Natasha Massey and Professional Footballers’ Association chief Gordon Taylor have backed his return. Sheffield United did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.

The South Yorkshire club has refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction
