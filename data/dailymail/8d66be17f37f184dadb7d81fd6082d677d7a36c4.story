Big Love actress Chloe Sevigny has sold her one-bedroom Manhattan apartment for $1.76 million to the entrepreneur couple  Halle Tecco and Jeffrey Hammerbacher.

Sevigny has previously described the 1,250 square foot home, with working fireplaces, beams and a private garden as 'womblike' and said she drew inspiration for its decoration from her New England childhood.

The new owners of the apartment, on 10th Street, made their fortune in technology.

Moving on: Big Love actress Chloe Sevigny has sold her East Village apartment for $1.76 million

Ms Tecco founded digital health start 
ups fund, Rock Health, and Mr Hammerbacher, who went to college with 
Mark Zuckerberg, worked at Facebook before starting his software firm 
Cloudera, the New York Post said.

Sevigny had originally put the apartment, which has a small study and plenty of close space, on the market last year.

However, the original deal fell through in July because of a death in the buyer's family, according to Business Insider.

According to its listing by realtor 
Corcoran: 'Upon entering this very special apartment through the gate, 
one is instantly transported to a retreat in the country.'

The brownstone has a private garden, casement windows and a working fireplace in the bedroom and living room.

After
the actress bought the 1862 East Village apartment for $1.2 million in 
2005, she turned to designer David Cafiero, who owns New York antiques 
store Cafiero Select, for help.

'We’re both from New England,' Sevigny told New York Magazine. 'He’s really inspired by the sea, and I grew up on the water. I was like, "Ahhh. I wish I could just live in his store!".'

The apartment was redesigned with bold print wallpaper, refurbished antiques, and a sprinkling of nautical themed items.

The exposed brick walls were plastered over to accommodate the actress's art collection, and the plaster was painted in pale pinks, blues and yellows.

Its design was featured in a 2007 edition of Home and Garden and in the 2009 edition of Apartamento.

Sevigny, who grew up in Darien, Connecticut, said the wide planks used for floorboards, and low ceilings made her fall in love with the apartment.

'I walked in and felt transported, like I wasn’t in Manhattan anymore,' she said.

The co-op, which also has a large communal garden, is popular with artists, actors and musicians.

When Sevigny moved in her neighbors included the sculptor Robert Gober, former lead guitarist of the Smashing Pumpkins, James Iha, and the actress Parker Posey, according to the New York Times.

The new owners, who married in July last year, met in North Beach, San Francisco, where they are based.

Mr Hammerbacher's expertise at Facebook earned him joint-second place in Forbes' list of the most powerful data scientists in the world in 2011.

His wife started her not-for-profit company in 2010 to try to improve technology in healthcare, while reducing costs and improving education for health innovators, according to Health Datapalooza.
