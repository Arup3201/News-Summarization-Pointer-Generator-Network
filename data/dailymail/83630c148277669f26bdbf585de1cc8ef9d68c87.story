IT is the most infamous stretch of ground in Australia, the notorious Belanglo Forest where serial killer Ivan Milat took seven victims to rape, torture, hunt and murder them before burying their bodies in shallow graves covered with twigs.

The lonely patch of scrub, just a turn off the highway 140km south-west of Sydney, still strikes fear in those who know the gruesome truth of what Backpacker Killer Ivan Milat did there, but it was a source of inspiration to his grand nephew.

From a young age, Matthew Milat had an ambition. He wanted to be like his notorious uncle Ivan, the backpacker murderer whose reign of fear slaughtering hitchhikers has its own shocking place in Australian history.

Sordid ambition: Matthew Milat (pictured being led into court during his murder trial) boasted about copying his infamous great uncle, the  backpacker murderer, Ivan Milat, and did just that, taking a 17-year-old to the killing field, the Belanglo Forest and murdering him with an axe

The legend: The gruesome exploits of serial killer Ivan Milat (pictured) who raped, tortured and killed seven backpackers chill the Australian public, but they excited his nephew who revered his uncle as a legend and chose the Belanglo Forest to murder David Auchterlonie

Killed on his birthday: David Auchterlonie (pictured) was lured to the Belanglo forest on his 17th birthday to drink beer and smoke cannabis, but was cruelly attacked by his two teenage 'friends' with a double-headed axe, and his death throes recorded on a mobile phone

On Thursday night, a special episode of the Nine Network's Inside Story entitled 'Born Bad', explores the lives of three young men and Matthew Milat who as teenagers committed the most horrific of crimes.

Their victims were also teens, and friends of their killers who showed them no mercy.

As Matthew Milat said before he and his accomplice, Cohan Klein, set out for the fateful evening with a double-bladed axe, 'We’re going out to Belanglo and someone’s going to die'.

It was November 20, 2010, David Auchterlonie's 17th birthday. He had celebrated the morning with his family near Bargo, a town 100km south-west of Sydney and his grandmother Sandra had given him $20 to spend.

'Babes in the wood': Forensic police carry a body from the Belanglo Forest after the remains of seven young backpackers were found tortured and killed and buried in shallow graves under twigs and leaves 'like babes in the wood' by serial killer Ivan Milat, whose nephew would later try to emulate his hideous crimes

Murder weapon: Matthew Milat drove David Auchterlonie to the Belanglo Forest where he pulled out this double-bladed axe (pictured) and taunted the 17-year-old before striking him in the head until he was dead

NO mercy: The final moments of Sandra Auchterlonie's (above) grandson, David, 17, in the Belanglo Forest include these cold, angry words of his killer, Matthew Milat: 'You wanna f***ing die man? Look at the f***in' dirt ... You keep looking at me and I'll cut your head off. Look at the ground c***'

Shallow graves: the scrubland and outcrops inside the Belanglo Forest (above) 140km south-west of Sydney are unsettling even today, more than 30 years after Ivan Milat's backpacker killings, but just over four years after his nephew revisited the spot to carry out his own bloodthirstycrime

Matthew Milat and Cohen Klein, both 19,  lured him away with the promise of drinking and smoking cannabis in the area where Ivan Milat had murdered seven young travellers - two Australians, Two Britons and three Germans - in the early 1990s.

Matthew Milat was the one in control. He had changed his real surname - Muleman, to match his great uncle's after leaving school, where he was remembered as a non-achiever and Cohen as a kind-hearted, quiet kid.

With a fourth teenager, Chase Day, the young men drove to the forest. Auchterlonie was oblivious as to his companions' intent until Milat produced the quaint looking axe with the double head and began to threaten him before striking struck him on the head until 'Auchto', as the boys called him, was dead.

Mad, bad and dangerous to know: Serial killer Ivan Milat had a cowboy and gun fantasy and raped, hunted and executed his victims - both male and female - before hiding their remains under brush in the forest south-west of Sydney

Stupid: Matthew Milat (pictured) changed his surname from Muleman to match that of his infamous uncle and then set out on a successful mission to murder, earning himself a 43 year sentence in the same prison system where uncle Ivan will eventually die in jail

Weapon of choice: Recreated in the Nine Network episode of Inside Story, Born Bad, Matthew Milat carries a double headed axe on what was meant to be a boys' night out, which ended in murder of a teenage boy and the sentencing of serial killer Ivan Milat's great nephewand another to decades in prison

 Klein recorded the entire attack on a mobile phone. The audio records their torment of Auchterlonie, blow by blow, and his dying gutteral moan.

It starts with the cold, angry voice of Matthew Milat saying, 'I'm being dead set Auchto, you wanna f***ing die man? You wanna f***ing get in my business?'.

'Look at the f***in' dirt Auchto. I am going to f***in' kill you if you keep f***in' movin'. Look at the ground and answer my questions.'

David Auchterlonie is heard crying.

Milat then says, 'You keep looking at me and I'll cut your head off. Look at the ground c***. Tell me, is it true you have been going around telling people my affairs?'

Auchterlonie: 'No it is not true, alright?'

In several more exchanges, Milat again tells Auchterlonie to to look at the ground and to swear his innocence.

Finally, Milat says, 'Yeah you give me your word and your word isn't f***in' good enough Auchto. I've had your word before and It aint worth a pinch of cold f***in' s***'.

The next sound is of the axe striking Auchterlonie.

The Nine Network's  programme features exclusive interviews with a witness to the crime and with members of the victim’s family, including his grandmother Sandra Auchterlonie.

Also in this episode is a crime just as brazen and shocking. It is the story of two 16-year-old schoolmates in America who made a real-life version of the horror flick 'SCREAM'.

Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik had such a passion for horror movies,they decided to make their own – a slasher movie with a real-life victim, their school friend from Pocatello High School, Idaho, Cassie Stoddard, while she was house sitting for a relative.

Draper and Adamcik visited Stoddard and her boyfriend, left, then returned with masks, gloves, knives and black clothing. They cut off the house's electricity and then entered the house and stabbed Stoddart 29 times, nine times fatally.

They captured  the episode on a video camera, from the moment they planned the murder in their school library through to the get-away as the two baby-faced killers, high on adrenaline, sped off into the night.

Like Matthew Milat and Cohen Klein, their home-made horror movie would also be their downfall.

All four killers are in prison. Matthew Milat is serving a maximum 43 years in the same prison system as Ivan Milat and  lost his appeal last October for a reduction of his sentence.

The court did reduce the Cohan Klein's maximum sentence  by five years to 27 years, with an earliest release date of 2030.

Following their arrest, Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik blamed each other. Both were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility for parole for first degree murder and 30 years-to-life for conspiracy to commit murder.

Inside Story's Born Bad airs on Thursday night on the Nine Network at 8.40pm
