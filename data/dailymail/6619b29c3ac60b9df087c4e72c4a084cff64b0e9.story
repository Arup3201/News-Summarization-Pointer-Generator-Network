Victim One, an 18-year-old who took the stand against Jerry Sandusky, will release a tell-all book next month describing their horrific experiences with the convicted child molester.

In addition, Victim 1 will grant their first interview to ABC, to be aired in synch with the book’s release, though it is unclear which personality at the network will interview him.

Sandusky, who was convicted in the scandal that brought shame to Penn State, will be sentenced on October 9, nearly four months after he was found guilty.

Tell-all: Jerry Sandusky, right, was found guilty of extensive child sex abuse; Victim One will release a tell-all book and give his first interview to ABC in October

Page Six exclusively confirmed Victim 1’s plans to grant his first interview to ABC to coincide with his book release.

The details of the ABC interview are still being ironed out, including who will conduct it, and where the interview will take place.

A representative for ABC declined to comment, and Victim 1’s rep could not be reached by Page Six.

Sandusky was convicted in June of 45 counts of sex abuse involving 10 boys. Prosecutors said some of the assaults took place on the Penn State campus.

The 68-year-old Sandusky, given his age and the serious nature of the crimes, is likely to receive a sentence that will keep him in prison for life. He is jailed pending sentencing and maintains his innocence.

Judge John Cleland scheduled a morning
hearing at the courthouse in Bellefonte to determine if Sandusky should
be classified as a sexually violent predator, a designation that 
subjects a convict to intense reporting requirements upon release.

An
assessment board has recommended Sandusky for the designation, though 
it's expected to have little practical effect since he stands to die in 
prison.

Sandusky will be 
sentenced immediately after the hearing. The judge ordered defence 
attorneys and prosecutors to submit written statements 'intended to aid 
the court in the imposition of sentence' by October 5.

Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola said his client might make a statement at the hearing.

'Jerry
remains in relatively good spirits and has spent most of his time in 
custody preparing for his sentencing and his appeal,' Amendola said via 
email.

Day of reckoning: Sandusky will be sentenced on October 9, nearly four months after he was convicted on 45 counts of sex abuse

Attorney Tom Kline, 
representing a young man who testified during Sandusky's trial that he 
was fondled in a school shower in 2001, said Monday he expects his 
client either to testify at sentencing or to supply a statement to the 
court.

'We expect to provide
what is requested by the attorney general's office to assure justice is
achieved in Mr. Sandusky's sentencing,' Kline said in an email.

Attorney general's office spokesman Nils Frederiksen said prosecutors will make a sentencing recommendation to the judge.
