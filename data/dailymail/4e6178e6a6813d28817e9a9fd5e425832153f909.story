Police raided the home of an eBay fur dealer and found coats believed to have been made from animals including wolves, otters and ocelots.

Officers were shocked to find skins of the jungle animals at the property in Chorley, Lancashire on Saturday.

The sale of rare furs and leathers is only permitted in Britain to those holding a special permit.

These three coats thought to be made from wolf fur were among the haul found at the property in Lancashire

Three coats were seized. The trader was not arrested or charged. 

Police said they were now offering 'advice and support to the person involved to assist them in running their business lawfully'.

Preston Police's Wildlife and Rural Crime Officers carried out the raid with the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit.

Officers involved in the operation said it is important to realise 'this happens locally, not a distant international issue'.

The fur and skin of endangered animals or fish - and goods such as jewellery, shoes, bags and belts made from them - are banned for import into the UK unless traders have a valid permit.

The furs of animals caught in leg-hold traps are also prohibited for import unless accompanied by certification.

EU rules control the import of the furs of wild badger, beaver, bobcat, coyote, ermine, fisher, lynx, marten, musk rat, raccoon, otter, sable and wolf.

Commercial imports of baby harp seal and hooded seal skins are also prohibited, as well as the sale of any product made from seals.

One of the furs was advertised as that of an ocelot - a small jungle cat known also called the dwarf leopard
