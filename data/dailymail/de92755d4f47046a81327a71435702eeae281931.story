Luiz Adriano wrote himself into the Champions League record books on Tuesday night by scoring five goals in Shakhtar Donetsk's 7-0 victory away to BATE Borisov.

Even on such a free-scoring night of European action, the Brazilian's feat was exceptional and he became only the second player to score five goals in a Champions League game. The other was Lionel Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.  

He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament.

Luiz Adriano, 27, hails from Porto Alegre and started his career at hometown club Internacional, for whom he made 12 league appearances and scored three goals during the 2006-2007 campaign.

The highlight of his short career at the club came against European champions Barcelona in the final of the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup.

Having scored the winner against Al-Ahly in the semi-finals, the striker came on as a late substitute in the final and assisted Adriano Gabiru in scoring the winner.

Around this time, he was involved in the Brazil Under 20 squad, making 11 appearances and scoring twice, but he never made the step-up to the Selecao's first team.

In March 2007, Luiz Adriano followed in the footsteps of many other Brazilian players by moving to the Ukrainian league with Shakhtar for a fee of about £2.5m.

His first full season with Shakhtar resulted in Ukrainian league glory and in 2009, he scored the team's first goal in their UEFA Cup final win over Werder Bremen.

By 2009-2010 he was fully settled in Donetsk and his goalscoring ratios steadily climbed - in 2009-10 he scored 17 goals in 36 games and the following year got 20 in 37.

His goals helped Shakhtar to an outstanding period of success as they won the title five seasons in a row and became a dangerous opponent to face in Europe.

In February 2011, he scored the decisive goal in their 3-2 away win over Roma in the first leg of a last 16 tie.

His involvement in Europe has sometimes been controversial. He received a one-match suspension for unsporting behaviour after pouncing on a Willian backpass to the Nordsjaelland goalkeeper following an injury and going on to score. Shakhtar backed UEFA's sanctions and said they were deeply disappointed by Adriano's actions.

Across all competitions, he has 115 goals in 246 appearances for the club and his fourth goal against BATE meant he overtook Andriy Vorobey to become their all-time leading goalscorer.
