The Monopolies Commision have clearly had a word with David Pipe before Saturday's Betfred Midlands Grand National as the Nicholshayne handler does not have a runner.

The Uttoxeter marathon has been a benefit for the Devon operation which has dominated the feature for the past four years. The absence of a Pipe representative means the likes of Jonjo O'Neill, Paul Nicholls and Venetia Williams will fancy their chances of landing another prestigious staying event.

O'Neill has the ante-post favourite in Catching On, who was ridiculously impressive at Exeter on deep ground last time, travelling through the race like a horse well in advance of his current handicap mark.

He is difficult to oppose given the manner of that performance, while Classic Chase hero Hawkes Point will also have his followers given the strength of his connections in this race and the fact he has been freshened up since Warwick.

The layers look to have those two pegged, however, and there could be a little more juice in the price of SAMINGARRY (Uttoxeter, nap, 3.50) who hails from a yard that could not be in better form.

Five of Nigel Hawke's last 11 runners have obliged, which is an outstanding feat given the size of his stable, and the selection looked a chaser capable of taking fairly high rank last year.

He never quite lived up to that billing but the first-time headgear and tongue tie applied today could produce a better showing and he looks overpriced at his odds this morning.

The coral.co.uk Winter Derby looks a terrific race and TRYSTER (Lingfield, nb, 3.05) is taken to continue his rapid progress.
