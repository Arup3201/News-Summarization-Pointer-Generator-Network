An American man was murdered in the Bahamas over the weekend while attempting to help a woman who was being mugged.

Kyle Bruner was in Nassau, Bahamas pursuing his dream of working on tall ships, a type of sailboat.

Bruner was a private sailor serving aboard a tall ship that was docked in the island port when he reportedly witnessed a woman being mugged and tried to stop the men as they attempted to snatch her jewelry.

Tragic: Kyle Bruner was in Nassau, Bahamas working as first mate on a tall ship when he was shot in the neck and killed while trying to help a woman who was being robbed

But the men were armed and Bruner was shot in the neck Sunday, killing him.

According to Bruner’s family, the 34-year-old was previously a special education teacher.

The family originally came from Indiana, where Bruner attended high school and college, before resettling in the Northwest side of Chicago.

Bruner also served in Indiana’s Army National Guard.

Though shocked and grieving, his family members weren’t surprised that valiant efforts preceded Kyle’s death.

‘It was very much in his character,’ 
Kyle’s father Rick Bruner told WGN. ‘He never liked bullies, and he 
never stood for people around him being bullied. So, this what he would 
do.  In retrospect, you say maybe he should have avoided the situation 
but that’s not really who he was or the person that we loved.’

Bruner had been slated to leave the island in a week.

Investigators in the Caribbean nation capital have thus far apprehended one suspect in the slaying, but say two more remain on the loose.

The U.S. Department of State characterizes the crime level on New Providence Island, where Nassau is located, as critical.

Too common: The U.S. Department of State calls the crime situation in the Bahamas 'critical' and reports of petty thefts as well as violent crimes are on the rise

’Snatch-and-grab’ crimes are common occurrences in Nassau and are on the rise along with violent crimes in the country.

The Royal Bahamian Police Force reported a 35 percent increase in murders between 2010 and 2011.

Crimes are less common in areas dense with tourists, but the State Department says it 'has received reports of assaults, including sexual assaults, in diverse areas such as in casinos, outside hotels, or on cruise ships.’
