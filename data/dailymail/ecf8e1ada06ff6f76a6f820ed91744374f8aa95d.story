A third night of violent protests flared up in Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday as police in riot gear and armored trucks trained high-powered rifles on protesters. 

The demonstrations in the quiet suburb of St Louis were sparked by the police shooting of an unarmed teenager Michael Brown on Saturday night.

Police revealed today that a woman had been shot in the head in an alleged drive-by shooting in Ferguson on Tuesday night while in a separate incident, a police officer reportedly shot an armed man.

It was unclear whether the shootings were connected to the protests, according to NBC reports. 

Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by a police officer on Saturday night. The teen, who was about to start college, was unarmed

According to WBNS, four men wearing ski masks and armed with shotguns believed to be staging a robbery were apprehended by officers.

One suspect confronted an officer with a handgun. The officer, who feared for his life said a police spokesman, shot the armed subject.

The alleged robber was taken to hospital in critical condition.

In a separate incident, a woman was shot once in the head during a drive-by shooting, police reported. She was taken to hospital and is expected to live.

The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has established a no-fly zone over Ferguson after police said one of their helicopters was fired upon on multiple occasions. The ban will remain in place until Monday.

Following a rally by civil rights leader Al Sharpton on Tuesday, crowds confronted police and refused orders to disperse. 

Police fired more tear gas on the protests but overall, the situation did not escalate as it had on previous nights. 

On Sunday and Monday nights, tensions have run high in Ferguson where crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted police. 

Riot officers dressed in tactical gear shot rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds at protesters who volleyed rocks in return. 

At a rally held by Reverend Sharpton on Tuesday night, the mother of Michael Brown, Lesley McSpadden, demanded that the police officer who shot her son come forward.

'You take your punishment,' Lesley McSpadden said. 'If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

Reverend Sharpton added: 'The local authorities have put themselves in a position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will not trust anything but an objective investigation.'

Her plea comes as Ferguson police refused to name of the officer in question, citing death threats made on social media.

An officer in the records department of the Ferguson Police headquarters told MailOnline today that their computers had been shut down because they had been hacked.

The Ferguson Police Department released a statement on Wednesday mourning the loss of the 18-year-old and asking for peace in the community. It made no mention of the identity of the officer involved.

The statement read: 'We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner. We further ask all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community.

'Unfortunately,
 those who wish to co-opt peaceful protests and turn them into violent 
demonstrations have been able to do so over the past several days during
 the evening hours. These events are no indicative of the City of 
Ferguson and its residents.'

Demonstrators flooded into the street following a rally over the death the teenager Michael Brown. When the crowd refused to disperse, the police deployed tear gas for the third night

The police claim that the teenager assaulted the police officer in the street on Saturday and made a grab for his weapon.

That claim is entirely refuted by Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who was within feet of the entire incident. 

Mr Johnson, 22, said his friend fled from the officer after being shot once, held his hands up and shouted that he was unarmed. The officer then repeatedly fired shots at Brown, Mr Johnson said. 

Police admit that Brown was shot 'a couple of times' but could not give an exact number. 

Vigils have been planned across the U.S. on Thursday in response to recent alleged acts of police brutality including the killing of 18-year-old Brown. 

Organized by a movement called the National Moment Of Silence, vigils are being planned in 50 cities across 30 states.

President Obama released a statement on Tuesday where he addressed the teen's shooting.

He said: 'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time. As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed. 

'I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. 

'We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.'

The Ferguson Police Department released a statement on Wednesday following the shooting of Michael Brown four days ago.

It read:'The City of Ferguson mourns the loss of Michael Brown's life that occurred this past Saturday. We understand members of our community and those nationwide, are grieving with us. We have worked diligently to provide an opportunity for our residents to both grieve and voice frustrations through prayer vigils and peaceful protests. 

'We would like to extend our gratitude to the St Louis County Police Department, the St Louis City Police Department, the Missouri Highway Patrol and numerous local law enforcement agencies for their assistance over the past several days. These officers have worked throughout the night to quell violent outbursts and restore calm to our City.

'We are working to restore confidence in the safety of our community and our neighborhoods so that we may begin the healing process. We have heard the community's cries for justice and assure the public that the Ferguson Police Department will continue to cooperate fully in the investigations led by the St Louis County Police Department, the FBI and the Justice Department. 

'We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner. We further ask all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community.

'The City of Ferguson has been through tough situations in the past, albeit nothing to this magnitude, but will continue to display resilience and fortitude. The Mayor and City Council are committed to taking the necessary steps to rebuild and strengthen our community. We look forward to your cooperation and support.'
