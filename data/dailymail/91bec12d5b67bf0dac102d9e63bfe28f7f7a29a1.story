A white supremacist prison gang member has been arrested over a suspected bank robbery after a brief stint as Utah's 'Public Enemy Number One'.

Charley Louis Sanford, 28, recently broke out of a halfway house where he was on supervised release after being sentenced in 2013 to 21 months for bank fraud. 

His photo was released on Thursday by the Salt Lake Metro Gang Unit. Ten hours later, he was arrested following numerous public tips and back behind bars at the Weber County Jail.

He was arrested on Thursday without incident and was found to be in possession of a gun.

The 28-year-old is suspected of robbing the Key Bank on Tuesday. He was charged with aggravated robbery and carrying a concealed weapon, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. 

Sanford's criminal history is long and varied. At 19, he was charged with an armed bank robbery in Olympus Grove and jailed in 2006. His mugshot from the time showed that he already had several tattoos on his neck and chest. 

In 2010, he escaped from a halfway house but was recaptured and sentenced again.  

In October 2013, he was in court for illegal possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia. He was given a suspended year-long jail sentence and 18 months on probation. 

He pleaded guilty in 2012 to drug possession and giving false information in a case. 

Sanford, 28, had numerous tattoos including swastikas, lightning bolts on his cheeks and two horns on his forehead 

After his recent release from prison for bank fraud, he was ordered to be placed on supervised release, banned from drugs and alcohol and ordered to under mental health treatment.  

A description of Sanford was released by authorities telling the public to be on the lookout for a 6ft white male, weighing 185 lbs with brown eyes and brown hair. 

His numerous tattoos were noted including several on his neck,  a swastika on his right cheek and  horns on the forehead. Police noted lightning bolts on his left cheek which also appeared to be SS, signifying Hitler's terrifying paramilitary unit under the Nazi regime. 

The 28-year-old also has the word 'pride' tattooed over his right eyebrow and a UFC (perhaps to stand for Ultimate Fighting Championship) on his hand. 

Sanford's Facebook page lists his profession as a tattoo artist and that he is married to Cait Fox, who reportedly works at MAC Cosmetics.
