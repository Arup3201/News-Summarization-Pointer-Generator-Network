Two Las Vegas men who police describe as 'holistic-type' doctors are being investigated in the wake of the death of a 74-year-old woman who died following a medical procedure in August.

Cody Stoneking and Karl Bachman allegedly performed an unapproved procedure on Kim Chun Ji Wang Liu that police say led to her death.

Neither man shows up in a licensing search of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

The board also reported no formal complaints filed against either of the two men.

It remained unclear Tuesday what type of procedure the deceased underwent before her death. 

As part of their investigation into Stoneking and Bachman, who cops say pretended to be doctors, police are asking that anyone with information about the two men come forward.

Police are especially interested in anyone who may have gone to Stoneking and Bachman for medical treatment.
