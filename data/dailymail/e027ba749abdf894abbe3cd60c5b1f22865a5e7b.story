Jack Wilshere looked upbeat despite his ankle operation as he posted a picture with son Archie on Saturday morning.

The Arsenal midfielder has had his comeback delayed after what manager Arsene Manager has described as a 'minor procedure'.

Wilshere will miss Sunday's Premier League clash with Everton at the Emirates Stadium, and posted a picture on Instagram with the caption: 'With my little Gunner'.

Jack Wilshere warms up ahead of Arsenal's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace last week

Wilshere had returned to full training with the Gunners two weeks after three months out

'He had a little surgery on his ankle because it was irritating him a bit but it's a very minor procedure so he will be out for a few days,' Wenger said.

'It was planned to be done at the end of the season and because he had an irritation with it we decided to do it now.'

Wilshere has not played for the Gunners since picking up the injury in a tackle with Manchester United's Paddy McNair in November.

The England international returned to the squad last week, but was an unused sub as Arsenal beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.
