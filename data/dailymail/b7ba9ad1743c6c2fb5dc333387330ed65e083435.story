Aaron Ramsey has launched a staunch defence of under-fire manager Arsene Wenger after hailing ‘the best’ goal of his career.

The Wales midfielder helped eased the pressure on the Arsenal boss with a wonder goal — an outrageous left-footed strike from 30 yards — in the comfortable 4-1 win away to Galatasaray in Istanbul on Tuesday night.

Wenger has been the target of heavy criticism from a section of supporters following the club’s disappointing start to the season in the Barclays Premier League. 

Arsene Wenger has endured some tough criticism from Gunners supporters in recent weeks

And Ramsey has defended his manager from the hurtful jibes from the stands.

‘Every player here wants to work hard for him, we have proven that again against Galatasaray,’ said Ramsey.

‘He has been under some unfair criticism, but we are all out there, are in it together. We wanted to get the result for us and for him.

‘I think whenever we go into a game, he knows our qualities, always believes in us and gives us a great feeling going into games.

‘Every time we go out there we are representing ourselves, our club and our manager.’

Ramsey, after an early-season blip, is now approaching the form that saw him win the club’s player of the year award last term.

His super strike in Turkey was testament to that — and Ramsey has warned Arsenal’s rivals that he feels close to his best.

‘I have seen the goal back, and it is definitely the best I have scored,’ he said. ‘As soon as I hit it, I thought it had a chance of going in and thankfully it went into the top corner.

‘My best goal before this one? I like the volley at Norwich last season, probably that one.’

He added: ‘I felt good at the Manchester United game last month, I am getting sharper in every game. I am feeling good and hopefully now I can play my part as the team go on a run.’

Lukas Podolski also scored twice, having been linked with a January move away following a lack of first-team opportunities.

The German forward told Arsenal’s website: ‘For me it was important to play 90 minutes and keep going. It is not always easy to come in and do well, so it was good for me to do that.’
