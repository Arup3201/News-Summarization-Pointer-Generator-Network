Manchester City braved the arctic-like conditions on Thursday as they trained at the Etihad Campus ahead of Saturday's mouth-watering top-of-the-table clash against Chelsea.  

City stopper Joe Hart was pictured with a shovel picking up snow with Manuel Pellegrini's side in need of a lift-off on the field after a frustrating couple of weeks.

Following successive defeats against Arsenal and most recently Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, this weekend's crunch clash against Jose Mourinho's men bears even greater significance now.

Defeat is simply not an option for City as they look to keep alive their chances of winning the double. 

Pellegrini admitted himself following City's FA Cup exit that their title hopes will be all but over if they don't beat Chelsea saying: 'We still have to play against Chelsea so it will be a very decisive game. We will try to win that game to close that gap again.

'The game we must play at Stamford Bridge is a very important game. We must close the gap to two points.'

Pellegrini's men will be looking to cut the five-point deficit the leaders Chelsea currently hold, with a defeat at Stamford Bridge putting City's title bid in serious jeopardy - considering Mourinho's men have lost just twice in the league all season.

The champions were dealt a blow on Wednesday evening after Ivory Coast advanced to the Africa Cup of Nations knock-out stages after beating Cameroon - meaning Yaya Toure and new signing Wilfried Bony will now not be available until early February.

Saturday evening will also be one of mixed emotions for Frank Lampard as he prepares for an emotional return to Stamford Bridge.

The veteran midfielder came off the bench to score a last-gasp equaliser for his current employers against the Blues - earning them a point in the process - but refused to celebrate the goal.
