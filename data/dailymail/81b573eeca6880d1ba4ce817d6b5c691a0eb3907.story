Steffon Armitage has reiterated his desire to play for England but appears increasingly pessimistic about his chances of doing so ahead of next year's World Cup.

The European Player of the Year, without a cap since moving to Toulon in 2011 owing to the RFU's strict policy on selecting overseas players, came close to joining Bath last month.

But that move fell through and the 29-year-old, rated among the world's best back row forwards, remains in international exile as England struggle through a testing autumn series.

'It would have been a lot easier if things had worked out with Bath,' Armitage admitted in an interview with The Times. 'But it didn't. At this point, I have to move past that.'

Armitage, who moved to the two-time European champions from London Irish having earned five caps while at the Premiership club, gave an impassioned defence of his desire to play for his country in the face of interest in his services from France.

'Maybe I spent time in France, but that is nothing, my heart was always with England,' he insists.

'I definitely still want to play for England,' he added. 'As a rugby player, you want to play at the top of the game, and the top of the game is your country.'

Perhaps more worryingly for England fans though, Armitage revealed his frustration at a lack of contact from England and head coach Stuart Lancaster, particularly when he was mulling over his future this time last year.

'That was on my mind, knowing there was a World Cup, but we heard nothing, no feedback from England,' he said. 'That made the decision to stay on in France quite easy.'

If England's performance in the defeat by South Africa on Saturday - their fifth Test loss in a row - was concern enough with a World Cup around the corner, then Armitage's consistent use of the past tense despite insisting he still wants to play for England is another blow to the Red Rose's hopes next year.

'It did bother me,' Armitage adds. 'But it has got to the point now where I have accepted it.'

For now, Armitage seems to have accepted his fate.

It appears the ball is well and truly in England and Lancaster's court.
