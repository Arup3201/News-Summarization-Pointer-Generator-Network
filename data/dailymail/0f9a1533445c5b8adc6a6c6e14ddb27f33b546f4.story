A woman is facing a felony aggravated assault charge in Wyoming after police say she bit off part of her boyfriend's chin during an argument.

Lola Lauren Brush, 30, of Jackson was arrested on December 6 and faces the felony and a domestic battery charge. 

Brush faces a maximum of 10 and a half years in jail and a $10,750 fine if she pleads or is found guilty.

Lola Lauren Brush of Jackson, Wyoming, is accused of biting off part of her boyfriend's chin during an argument and beat him with a SpongeBob Squarepants children's snow shovel

Police say Brush bit part of her boyfriend's chin off and beat the 30-year-old man with objects including a SpongeBob Squarepants children’s snow shovel and a wooden baseball bat during an argument.

Doctors were unable to reattach the man's chin and he now must undergo plastic surgery, said Jackson police Lt. Cole Nethercott on Monday.

Brush is out of jail on a $7,500 unsecured bond despite the concerns of Teton County Deputy Prosecutor Terry Rogers that she was a ‘very violent’ flight risk, reports the Jackson Hole News and Guide.

Police were called to the apartment the two share after several neighbors called to report their loud shouting.

Officers allegedly found a strip of flesh with part of the victim’s beard on it inside the apartment, and found blood in and around the apartment, as well as on the handle of a SpongeBob Squarepants shovel outside.

The fight allegedly occurred while the couple were out at a hockey game, but continued when they returned.

While she is out of jail, the judge has ordered Brush to take twice daily portable breath tests at the Teton County Jail and to refrain from possessing or drinking alcohol

The victim was transported to the hospital, where an emergency room doctor 'lost count' of how many stitches it took to close the bite wound on his chin, court files state.

Brush’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday. She is not allowed any contact with her boyfriend while the case makes its way through the courts.

While she is out of jail, the judge has ordered Brush to take twice daily portable breath tests at the Teton County Jail and to refrain from possessing or drinking alcohol.

She also is required to see a doctor and a therapist and file updates with the court to prove she is following their recommendations.
