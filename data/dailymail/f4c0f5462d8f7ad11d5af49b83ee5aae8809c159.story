Captaincy is a serious business, but it won’t force the fun out of Joe Marler. The England prop will go to Twickenham today determined to carry on epitomising his club’s colourful image.

A Harlequin is defined as a ‘joker’ and a ‘jester’, in which case the new skipper will stay true to the logo on his chest. The armband around his sleeve will not remove the grin from his face.

A Harlequin is also defined as a ‘mute character in a traditional pantomime’, but in that regard the cap doesn’t fit. Marler can be relied upon to keep delivering his trademark one-liners and generally maintaining a vocal presence, despite the responsibility of his new role.

Captain: Joe Marler is hoping to bring his own brand of captaincy to Harlequins

‘I have no idea yet what sort of captain I’m going to be,’ said the 24-year-old ahead of his side’s Aviva Premiership opener against London Irish; Part II of the annual London Double Header extravaganza at HQ, following the opening game between Saracens and Wasps. ‘But I’m not going to change a huge amount in the way I am.

‘There’s being a joker and being obstructive and there’s just having a laugh and enjoying the job.

‘I’ll probably have to stop shouting things out in meetings as much and accept that just before a game is not the best time for practical jokes!’

All the indications are that the jester in Marler is not going to be suppressed by leadership. He is in no hurry to ditch the non-conformist streak.

Back in December, 2011 the rookie loosehead played for Quins at a sold-out Twickenham with his familiar Mohican supplemented by hair forming the words ‘Jolly Hogg sausage’ to advertise team-mate Olly Kohn’s catering company.

Other slogans and patterns have followed, and the eye-catching trend won’t necessarily end with the club captaincy role.

‘I don’t know if I will do something like that again — no-one has approached me for some time,’ he said. ‘But I’m open to offers!’

In recent years, Quins have been led by England captain Chris Robshaw — a very different character to Marler, more serious, less exuberant — but the club’s director of rugby, Conor O’Shea, had no doubts about making this appointment and doesn’t want a clone.

‘Joe is a natural-born leader,’ said the Irishman. ‘He has played over 100 times for the club and he’s got 20-odd caps for England. He is one of the most respected blokes in our squad.

Wind-up: Marler admitted he was initially unsure about taking the role and thought the offer was a wind-up

‘Will he live and learn? Yes, but I don’t want him to be Chris Robshaw, Andre Vos (another former Quins captain) or Winston Churchill...I want him to be Joe Marler, bringing his own brand of leadership.

‘He will make some unbelievable decisions and he might also get questioned the odd time, because that goes with the job. You are up there to be shot at. But we do not want him to morph into something he’s not. He was picked to be captain because he is Joe Marler.’

The new skipper had led a team only once before — reluctantly — as a teenager. He gave a frank assessment of his efforts.

‘It was an England Under 18s training game at Bisham Abbey,’ said Marler. ‘I said no (to the captaincy), but ended up doing it anyway.

‘It was a training game against the South East academies. We won by 30-odd points but in the last play of the game we got a penalty and I told Rory Clegg to kick the goal because I was hanging (exhausted). It was a training game and I shouldn’t have done that but I was too tired!

‘He did kick the goal, he nailed it, but I don’t know if I would do that again. I might go at it Barbarians style — they are decent crowd favourites who never go for the posts. We’ll see how it goes.’

Decision: After being 'apprehensive' about taking the role, Marler took advice from those close to him

When O’Shea approached Marler about taking on the role, the offer was initially treated as a wind-up. It was no such thing and the man in charge gave the player space to think about whether or not he wanted the armband and the responsibility. The immediate inclination to decline was gradually overcome.

‘I was initially shocked and I looked for every possible reason not to do it because I was a bit scared and apprehensive,’ said Marler. ‘I took a while to think about it and I spoke to a few people — Chris, Will Skinner (another ex-Quins captain) and my partner (Daisy) — then decided to give it a crack.’

Asked if leading a team containing the current England captain was an onerous prospect, he added: ‘Chris is a good, decent bloke and when I spoke to him, he said, “Go for it, I think it will be good”. He will back me all the way. To have guys like him, Nick Easter, Nick Evans and Danny Care around makes my life easier.’

His first task, starting today, will be to oversee a better start to this domestic season than Quins had last year, to avoid the need for another late charge.

Prop: Marler faces a duel with Alex Corbisiero of Northampton to be England’s first-choice loosehead prop

‘We’re really excited,’ he said. ‘Our realistic goal is to be far more consistent. We went on a great run at the end of last season that got us into the semi-finals, but ideally we don’t want to have to do that; where every game is a must-win.’

On a personal level, Marler faces an intriguing duel with Alex Corbisiero of Northampton to start the autumn Test series as England’s first-choice loosehead prop.

‘I’m very realistic about where I stand with England,’ he said. ‘I will try my hardest this season to push for that World Cup squad because it is a massive dream and a massive goal. But if I don’t take care of club business, I will be nowhere near it.

‘If your club is doing well, you have a chance to be looked at more than others when it comes to England selection. And I suppose being captain of Quins can’t hurt.’

It certainly can’t. The jester with the armband has a glorious opportunity to expand his repertoire at the best possible time.
