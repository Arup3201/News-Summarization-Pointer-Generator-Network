A Pennsylvania appeals court has denied a new trial for former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky after he was found guilty of sexually abusing 10 boys.

The unanimous decision by a three-judge Superior Court panel on Wednesday came barely two weeks after they heard oral arguments by Sandusky's lawyer and a state prosecutor. Defense lawyer Norris Gelman said he planned to ask the state Supreme Court to review the case.

Sandusky, 69, had argued his trial lawyers 
did not have sufficient time to prepare, a prosecutor made improper 
references to him not testifying on his own behalf and the judge 
mishandled two jury instructions.

Victims who had not come forward with their 
allegations during Sandusky's trial in June 2012 were granted 
settlements by the Pennsylvania university yesterday

The opinion by Judge Jack Panella said trial judges have discretion about whether to allow pretrial delays, and that in Sandusky's case the judge carefully considered the continuance requests.

'The decision does not reflect a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of Sandusky's request; it was not an arbitrary denial,' Panella wrote.

Sandusky had wanted the trial judge, John Cleland, to give jurors an instruction about the amount of time it took for nearly all of the victims to report their allegations.

Panella wrote that Cleland should have evaluated the need for such a jury instruction based on each victim's age and maturity, but Cleland's failure to do so did not harm Sandusky.

'The trial court specifically instructed
the jury that they were to consider any possible motives of the victims
in coming forward,' Panella wrote.

'The vigorous cross-examination of the victims and arguments by defense counsel, when combined with the trial court's instructions on credibility, clearly defined the issues for the jury.'

The issue related to Sandusky not testifying was not properly preserved for appeals court review, Panella wrote.

The appeals court also turned down 
another jury instruction claim, related to weighing a defendant's good 
character against the allegations.

Messages left for a spokesman for the attorney general's office were not immediately returned.
