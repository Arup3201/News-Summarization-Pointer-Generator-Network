Unhealthy foods and fizzy drinks should be taxed to encourage healthy eating and ease Britain's obesity crisis, an academic has claimed.

Dr Mike Rayner, a leading academic at Oxford University's Department of Public Health, believes ministers should up VAT on chocolate, burgers and pasties to make people eat better.

Dr Rayner told the BBC that as one in four British adults is obese or overweight, the nation's obesity epidemic is costing the NHS more than Â£5m a year.

A love of fatty, unhealthy, junk foods is causing an obesity epidemic in Britain and costing the NHS millions

To help tackle the problem, Dr Rayner proposed a 12p tax on soft drinks, claiming it could save up to 2,000 lives a year as people switch to healthier alternatives.

He likened the proposed rise to existing taxes which are already in place on cigarettes and alcohol.

Dr Rayner said: 'We are in the grip of an obesity epidemic. We, as a nation, are eating too many calories.

'We use taxes to discourage drinking and smoking.

'It raises lots of money for the treasury and prevented people from dying too early. There is now lots of evidence that manipulating food prices could promote healthy eating.'

His proposals come a month after the government announced a controversial 'pasty tax' on hot takeaway food, though Dr Rayner said the food taxing system remains 'very muddled'.

In 2004, Tony Blair rejected the idea of a tax on fatty foods, saying it would make Britain too much of a nanny state.

MPs have suggested the way to tackle obesity is through education and better packing, which were more practical options.

Steve Webb, a Liberal Democrat 
pensions minister, called on manufacturers to put 'put less junk into 
the food' and said of the fat tax: 'It should certainly be looked at, 
but not as a tax-raising measure.'

Dr
Rayner referenced how Denmark has brought in a 'fat tax' on foods with 
saturated fats, saying the Scaninavian country has 'got the right idea.'

He
added: 'Instead we need to rethink the way we apply VAT to food. At the
moment we have a muddled system: you do pay tax on some 
relatively-healthy things like smoothies, but you don't pay it on a lot 
of junk food like chips or doughnuts.

'I don't care whether it's hot or cold, whether you got it from a takeaway or a shop - I'd like us to tax all unhealthy foods from butter to biscuits. And in doing so we can tackle a problem that will only keep expanding.'
