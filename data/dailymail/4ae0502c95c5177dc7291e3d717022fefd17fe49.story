Hundreds of friends and family of different faiths came together in an Indiana mosque Friday for a funeral service honoring the legacy of Abdul-Rahman Kassig, formerly
known as Peter, who was beheaded by ISIS militants in
Syria.

Kassig, a 26-year-old former US Army Ranger, converted to Islam and took a new name during his year-long captivity. 

His family said
he made a sincere conversion in a process that began before Kassig was captured by Islamic State militants in October 2013, which has seized parts of Iraq
and Syria and is the target of intense US-led airstrikes.

On Friday, Kassig's loved ones attended the funeral
service in the mosque at Al-Huda Foundation in the Indianapolis suburb of Fishers, which included a
sermon by a prominent Syrian exile, cleric and Muslim scholar
Shaykh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi, formerly Imam of the Grand Umayyad
Mosque in Damascus, who flew in from Washington DC to deliver the eulogy.

'He took every risk in order to help the Syrian people, to
remove some of their tragedy, to offer them some relief,' al-Yaqoubi said. He called Kassig 'one of our brothers who
sacrificed his life for the sake of God.'

He offered condolences to Ed and Paula Kassig, Peter's parents, calling their son a
great hero 'who carried in his heart the principles of Islam
even before becoming a Muslim.'

Al-Yaqoubi used the occasion to denounce Kassig's murderers, calling them 'terrorists' and declaring that their violent actions go against everything Islam stands for.

‘The question is, is this Islam? Definitely not. Does this group belong to Islam? No, it does not…. Islam is a religion of love, mercy and peace and... encouraging killing is not Islamic,’ he told the audience, according to The Indianapolis Star.

‘Islam and human rights can never clash. God does not preach hatred. God is against oppression,’ reported WTHR.

Al-Yaqoubi promised the extremists who took Kassig's life 'hellfire for every crime their commit.'

The prominent Syrian cleric thanked Peter/Abdul-Rahman for his 'great deeds' and 'acts of championship.'

‘When he went there he knew there were all these risk. He went against all odds showing every type of bravery this is why he’ll be remembered,’ said al-Yaqoubi. 

Desperate plea: During their son's captivity, Ed and Paula repeatedly called on ISIS to spare their son, like in a video recorded by them in October

Humanitarian: Kassig is shown here working in Syria in a picture posted on a community Facebook page set up to appeal for his release called 'Mercy for Abdul-Rahman Kassig - formerly known as Peter'

The Kassigs sat somberly in the audience during the prayer service, his mother wearing a white head scarf as customary in Islam. Several members of the congregation were photographed approaching the grieving parents to embrace them and offer their condolences.  

During their son's captivity, Ed and Paula repeatedly called on
ISIS to spare their son, who became the fifth European
or American captive beheaded by the militants.

On Thursday, the Kassigs took to Twitter revealing that they had adopted Kassig as a newborn.

'We have always been, and will always be, grateful that his
birthmother, Rhonda Schwindt, chose us to be his parents,; they
said in a statement. 'We know that she and Peter's siblings,
Jana and Sam Schwindt, share in our grief.'

Kassig was a medic and former US Army Ranger who served
briefly in Iraq in 2007 in the US Army. He returned to the
Middle East in 2012 for a spring break trip while studying
political science.

Moved by the suffering of Syrian refugees, he went to
Lebanon and volunteered as an emergency medical technician.

Peter reached out to his biological family when he turned 18. He formed a close bond with Jana Schwindt (left), whom he called 'Little Punk', and his 'Little Bro' Sam, pictured right 

He later founded an aid organization to provide food and
medical supplies to refugees from the conflict in Syria, where
some 200,000 people have died and millions are displaced.

Another Muslim prayer service will be held for Kassig 
Saturday in Indianapolis. A third memorial service will be held Sunday at Butler University in Indianapolis, where Kassig had
been a student.

Kassig's birth family, mother Rhonda Schwindt, 20-year-old sister, Jana, and 18-year-old brother, Sam, said they will hold a separate private memorial for Peter.  

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has ordered all government buildings in Marion County to fly their flags at half-staff from sunrise to sunset Sunday in Kassig’s memory.
