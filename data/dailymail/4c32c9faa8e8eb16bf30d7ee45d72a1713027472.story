Jailed: Carl Hull was jailed for 20 years for raping a trainee nurse in 1998 in a 'terrifying, painful and humiliating' ordeal

A sick rapist who told his victim he 'did not care' when she pleaded with him to stop because she was a nun has been jailed for 20 years.

Carl Hull, 43, attacked the terrified woman on December 29 1998, but escaped justice for 16 years after police were unable to trace DNA evidence to him.

He was finally apprehended in 2012 after new technology allowed officers to retest the samples and link the crime to serial attacker Hull.

Yesterday he was jailed for 20 years after admitting one count of rape at Birmingham Crown Court.

The court heard that he launched the attack just four days after being released from prison for another indecent assault.

Hull attacked the woman, who was 37 at the time, as she tried to get into her home in Edgbaston, Birmingham at around 8pm.

He subjected her to a 'terrifying, painful and humiliating' ordeal and threatened to kill her when the trainee nurse claimed she was a nun in an attempt to end the attack.

Jailing him Judge Melbourne Inman QC branded him a 'dangerous offender' who showed little insight into his crime.

He said: 'You pushed her up against a wall, switched off the light and threatened to kill her twice. You tried to kiss her and when she resisted you threatened to kill her again.

'She said that she had no sexual experience and that she was a nun. You said you did not care and set about demonstrating that.'

The court heard that sick Hull, from Sparkbrook, Birmingham, had a number of previous convictions and was caged for five years in 1995 after dragging a woman into a cubicle and assaulting her.

Samantha Forsythe, defending, said the defendant was from an unhappy and trouble background and had made the 'brave' decision to plead guilty.

Speaking after the case a spokesperson for West Midlands Police said that Hull was serving another prison sentence when the cold case review was launched.

He initially denied the attack, but admitted his crimes when confronted with the DNA evidence.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Emma Parker, said: 'Hull is an evil man: he raped a lone female in her own home resulting in devastating and lasting repercussions on her life for which he has shown no remorse.

'He is clearly a dangerous man and a threat to women*thankfully he's now off the streets for many years.

'This case shows that we never give up striving to win justice for victims. With the continuing advances in DNA we are able to routinely re-open cases, re-examine evidence and push for successful prosecutions.

'No-one who's committed an offence, even one many years ago, can rest easily because we could come knocking at any time.

'Despite her incredible fear she did everything she could, she tried talking to the man and calming him down but Hull said he didn't care and subjected her to an appalling assault before running off.

'I'm pleased we've finally been able to bring her attacker to justice and hope she can take some comfort for the fact he'll spend much of the rest of his life behind bars.'

Hull was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life and serve an extended eight year licence on release.
