Jailed: Ronnie Hutton admitted selling 76 vans while Co-operative boss to finance renovation of his semi-detached house

A £60,000-a-year transport manager of the Co-operative Group fleeced the firm by selling off dozens of its work vehicles and using the cash to renovate his house.

Ronnie Hutton, who was in charge of the firm's nationwide fleet of vans, stole 76 work vehicles over two years so he could do up his smart semi-detached home in Romiley, near Stockport, Greater Manchester.

The debt-ridden boss, who had climbed through the ranks from teenage apprentice to his management post, has been jailed after admitting the theft of £132,500.

The father-of-two sold on Ford, 
Renault and Volkswagen vans to long-term trade partners who thought the 
vehicles were being sold legitimately by the Co-operative.

But
instead Hutton, 41, kept the proceeds from the sales, while bosses 
somehow failed to notice the financial hole in the company's books.

Hutton,
who had been group fleet manager for six years, was eventually caught 
when an anonymous whistle blower wrote a letter to senior management 
revealing his scam.

Bosses launched an internal audit against Hutton after the tip-off, which led to him yesterday being jailed for two years.

Hutton
has offered to give up his company pension as a way of paying the money
back to his former firm, which has headquarters in Manchester.

The buyers of the vehicles - Wythenshawe fleet transport firm, RIJ Services - have also been left out of pocket.

After the frauds came to light, the Co-operative Group suspended its contract with the family business, leading to an 85 per cent drop in their trade.

Hutton had a £225,000 mortgage on his semi-detached house in Romiley, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, and had used the money to renovate the house

Hutton wiped away tears as he was jailed yesterday at Manchester Crown Court, while his wife collapsed sobbing in the public gallery.

Vincent Dean, defending, said it was ‘surprising’ the hole in the books had gone unnoticed for so long.

He said his client had ‘over-extended’ by the purchase and renovation of his home, and hadn’t frittered the cash on ‘fast cars and luxury holidays’.

Sold: Hutton told 76 vehicles, most of which were Ford Transit vans

Jailed: Judge Robert Atherton told Hutton at Manchester Crown Court that the former Co-operative boss had committed a 'gross breach of trust'

Hutton began stealing in 2008 when he found himself owing £50,000 to banks, plus a £225,000 mortgage, and had meant to pay the money back, added Mr Dean.

But as the costs of the renovation project spiralled out of control, he began helping himself to more money, the court heard.

Sentencing, Judge Robert Atherton told Hutton he had committed a ‘gross breach of trust’.

He said: 'I can’t help thinking that this was in the first place motivated by a wish for a standard of living which you simply could not possibly have managed - and you were not prepared to acknowledge that.'
