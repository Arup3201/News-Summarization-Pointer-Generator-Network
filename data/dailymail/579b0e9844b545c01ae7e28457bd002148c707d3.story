It appears Mark Clattenburg isn't the Premier League's only fan of Ed Sheeran as Manchester United duo Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney were also spotted at one of the singer's shows.

After referee Clattenburg got in trouble for breaking Premier League protocol in order to attend one of the singer's concerts in Newcastle, the United strikers have also shown their admiration for the 23-year-old by heading to his gig in Manchester.

Captain Rooney tweeted a picture of himself and Sheeran after the show, saying: 'Brilliant time at @edsheeran concert last night. Thanks for a great night mate.'

Meanwhile, his strike partner Van Persie was also at the event, although it didn't appear that the two had attended together.

The former Arsenal star tweeted a picture from the crowd, saying: 'Just experienced a great performance by @edsheeran. He's so talented, what a voice!!' 

It is not the only time Rooney has told of his admiration for a musician - he has the title of the Stereophonics' album Just Enough Education to Perform tattooed on his arm. 

Sheeran is popular with Premier League footballers, with Arsenal defender Calum Chambers and Everton midfielder James McCarthy watching him last week.

Mark Clattenburg will not officiate next weekend's games after breaking strict protocol on travelling to games

Clattenburg drove alone to West Brom v Crystal Palace at the weekend so he could see Sheeran perform

Clattenburg had been to an earlier Sheeran concert in Newcastle, but was forced to break Premier League protocol to do so. 

League rules state that referees and assistants must travel to games together, but Clattenburg drove to the match between West Brom and Crystal Palace on his own so that he could then drive back in time to make the concert in Newcastle.

The rules are there for integrity and security purposes, and Clattenburg's actions mean he will not take charge of a Premier League game this weekend.
