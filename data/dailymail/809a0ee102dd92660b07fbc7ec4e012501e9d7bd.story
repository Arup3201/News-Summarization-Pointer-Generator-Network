Charged: Patrick Rock is accused of four offences and will face magistrates next week

A key member of David Cameron’s ‘inner circle’ was yesterday accused of hoarding sexual images of naked children.

Four months after his arrest and dramatic resignation from Downing Street, Patrick Rock, 63, was charged with possessing 59 indecent images.

The Whitehall veteran is also accused of ‘making’ indecent photographs of children, which can mean manipulating the images in some way.

He will appear before magistrates next week after a lengthy investigation by specialist investigators at the National Crime Agency (NCA).

The charges are an embarrassment for the Prime Minister, who declined to comment on the matter while speaking at a press conference in Brussels yesterday.

Rock, formerly deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit and a protege of Margaret Thatcher, was one  of Mr Cameron’s closest confidantes.

The two men have known each other for two decades and worked side by side for Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary in the 1990s.

The public servant was involved in drawing up Government policy on filters designed to block vile images of child abuse.

And his seniority was demonstrated by the fact that he was one of only three advisers given his own private office in Number 10.

Rock was arrested at his flat in Fulham, west London, on February 13 after suspicious colleagues called in police.

Officers from the NCA – which aspires to be known as Britain’s FBI – searched his office and removed his laptop and other computer equipment.

In a statement, it said Rock is accused of possessing and making indecent images of children between July 31 and August 31 last year.

An NCA spokesman said: ‘The images have been assessed by NCA officers and Crown Prosecution Service lawyers as meeting the definition of level C.’

Level C images are the lowest level of indecent images of children and are generally described as ‘erotic posing’ involving naked or partially clothed victims.

According to official guidelines, people convicted of possessing this category of images are likely to receive a community penalty.

The Prime Minister said in Brussels: 'I won't be saying anything. It will be purely a matter for the courts'

Judith Reed, of the CPS, said: ‘The decision to prosecute has been taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.

‘We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.’

The investigation has been dogged by controversy because of a decision by NCA boss Keith Bristow to cloak it in extreme secrecy.

The fledgling agency, which says it aims to be open and transparent, refused to confirm or deny Rock’s arrest or the existence of any inquiry until yesterday.

The sensitive investigation was only made public weeks after it began when it was revealed by this newspaper.

The refusal to discuss the Rock case contrasts with the policy of every other police force, which is always to confirm arrests.

Leaders at the College of Policing insist it is in the public interest to do so and are privately mystified by the NCA’s approach.

It is understood that NCA policy was shaped by the Leveson Inquiry, which included proposals to rein in the Press.

The move highlights concerns that the inquiry into Press standards is letting police and other officials withhold information from the public.

Rock was released on bail and will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on July 3.
