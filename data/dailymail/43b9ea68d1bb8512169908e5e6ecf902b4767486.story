Screen legend Leslie Phillips was today rushed to hospital after he turned 'black and blue' during a seizure.

The 90-year-old star of 150 films, who is already slowly recovering from a life-threatening stroke, suffered the health scare at his west London home.

His third wife Zara, who he married 13 months ago, gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before an ambulance crew took him to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington.

He then underwent a series of tests there before he was discharged and tonight remains resting at his home in Maida Vale, west London.

'The seizure was minor fortunately,' she said. The actor suffered a stroke on a London bus six months ago.

It comes as he continues his recovery from a stroke during a shopping trip to London's Oxford Street in August last year.

Mrs Phillips, 55, said at the time: 'Leslie suddenly started leaning on me and was unable to put a ticket in his coat pocket.

'He had terrible pains in his left arm so I stopped the bus and called an ambulance which took him to University College Hospital in Euston.

'From there, he was then transferred to a top neurosurgery hospital in the capital.'

His Turkish-born wife has been a constant companion since the 2011 suicide of the actor's second wife, the former Bond girl Angela Scoular.

The Tottenham-born film legend was still working before the stroke, voicing the Sorting Hat of the Harry Potter films and acting in several British TV dramas including the Ruth Rendell Mysteries, Revolver and Agatha Christie's Marple.

He was born on April 20, 1924, into a working class family and made his first film appearances as a child in the 1930s.

He is believed to be the only actor still alive who performed at Pinewood Studios in its first week after opening in 1936.

During the Second World War, he was commissioned in 1943 as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, and transferred to the Durham Light Infantry in 1944.

Leslie Phillips was famed for his role in the Carry On films. Here he is pictured left in the 1960 film Carry On Constable

But he later left after being declared unfit for service with a neurological condition that caused partial paralysis.

Phillips returned to the stage and screen and became a household name as a star in the Carry On films and the Doctor comedy series in the 1960s onwards.

He was a friend of the late Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees and the late actor Peter O'Toole, and recently helped fund the memorial to the Bomber Command in Green Park.

His trademark rounded vowels came after his mother sent him to stage school to lose his Cockney accent - but he has never lost sight of his roots and has often been paraded around White Hart Lane as a celebrity football fan.

He was made an OBE in 1998 and a CBE in 2008 for services to drama.
