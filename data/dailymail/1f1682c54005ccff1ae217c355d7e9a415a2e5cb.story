An ex-Alabama police officer faces ten years in prison after being indicted on a federal charge following a violent confrontation with an Indian grandfather.

Eric Sloan Parker, 26, of Toney  was charged with one felony count of using unreasonable force by a federal grand jury on Thursday.

Sureshbhai Patel, 57, was left partially paralyzed after being slammed face-first during the confrontation in February, which was captured on  camera.

Patel was deprived of his right to be free from unreasonable searches, seizures and force by police during the confrontation with Parker, according to the indictment.

The charge against Parker carries a ten-year sentence, according to AL.com. He also faces a state misdemeanor assault charge which carries up to one year in jail.

Parker plans to plead not guilty, said defense attorney Robert Tuten.

'We are shocked, disappointed and overwhelmed by all the ways Eric Parker is coming under attack,' Tuten said in an email. 'However, we are looking forward to seeing the indictment and having our day in court.' 

Parker is scheduled to appear in court on April 15 for an evidentiary hearing.

'Police officers are sworn to uphold the law and protect the public,' said U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance in a statement on Friday. 'The public must be able trust the police.'

The former officer was fired last month from the Madison City Police Department following the incident.

Patel, who has suffered from partial paralysis, was visiting relatives when police were called to a suburban neighborhood where he was walking on February 6.

He had only been in the country for two weeks, arriving so he could help take care of his 17-month-old grandson.

Two officers initially responded to a complaint a 'suspicious person' was looking in garages around the neighborhood which residents say is usually quiet.

The caller said they did not recognize Mr Patel and claimed he was walking on other people's property. 

When officers arrived on the scene Patel said 'no English' and walked away as officers tried to search him before he was thrown to the ground

When they arrived on the scene he said 'no English', and repeated his son's house number in a bid to inform them he was in fact a resident.

He stepped away when officers tried to search him, prompting one of them to bring him to the ground.

Despite being lifted up and dusted down, Patel could not stay on his feet - and after two operations no his vertebrae, remains partially paralyzed. 

At the time of the incident, his son Chirag, who paid for him to fly over from the small Indian village of Pij, told AL.com: 'This is a good neighborhood. I didn't expect anything to happen.

'He was just walking on the sidewalk as he does all the time. They put him to the ground.'

'It is a dream for me because I came from a very poor family and I worked so hard here.'

Hank Sherrod, an attorney for the family, also told the site following the incident: 'This is broad daylight, walking down the street. There is nothing suspicious about Mr. Patel other than he has brown skin.

His son Chirag, who paid for him to fly over from the small Indian village of Pij, said bringing his father over to the US was a dream. He was surprised at the attack as he believes its a good neighborhood

'This is just one of those things that doesn't need to happen.'  

Patel has recently made progress by taking a few steps using a walker but remains in a rehab center in Huntsville.

Sherrod said the man and his family were 'very pleased by the prompt and decisive action' of federal prosecutors.

Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley previously apologized to the Indian government for the treatment of Patel, calling it a case of 'excessive force.'

The police chief in Madison, a suburb of Huntsville in the Tennessee Valley of north Alabama, also has apologized for what happened to Patel.
