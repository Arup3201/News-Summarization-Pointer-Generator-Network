Thierry Henry has hailed Thomas Muller and Franck Ribery as football's perfect role models - and labelled Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as 'freaks'.

The Arsenal legend will line up against Muller and Ribery when an MLS All-Star side takes on Bayern Munich on Wednesday.

And Henry believes youngsters should look to emulate them rather than the world's two best players.

On top of the world: Muller, Jerome Boateng and Per Metesacker celebrate with the trophy

He said: 'Stepovers, tricks, that's not the game. The game is what Thomas Muller is doing. If I had a son right now, playing, I would say to him 'look at them, look at [Franck] Ribery, look at Muller.'

'What Ronaldo does, and Messi, they're just freaks. Don't try to copy those guys. You can copy from Ribery, you can copy from Thomas Muller.

'What he did at the World Cup, people don't talk about it. They don't talk about it, but they should talk about it. He plays the game the right way: he defends, he attacks, he controls the ball when he has to control it, he reverses when he has to reverse it. When he has to finish, he'll finish.

Rested: Franck Ribery is raring to go for Bayern Munich after missing the World Cup through injury

'He doesn't do stepovers, but when he has to perform, he performs. He does what the game asks him to do.'

Muller scored five goals in Brazil as Germany beat Argentina to lift the World Cup but France forward Ribery missed out due to injury.

Bayern are unbeaten in five pre-season matches and begin the defence of their Bundesliga title at home to Wolfsburg on August 22.
