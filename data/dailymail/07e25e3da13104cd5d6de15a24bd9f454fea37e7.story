Newcastle United have completed the signing of Feyenoord right-back Daryl Janmaat for a fee of £5million.

The 24-year-old has replaced Mathieu Debuchy on Tyneside after the France international full-back finally moved to Arsenal in a £10m deal on Thursday.

But despite being an important member of Louis van Gaal's Holland squad at the World Cup, little is known of Janmaat.

Here, Sportsmail tells you more...

New signing: Holland right-back Daryl Janmaat has moved to Newcastle United from Feyenoord for £5million

Well then, who is he?

Janmaat is a 24-year-old right-back - born in Leidschendam in southern Holland - who has represented the Dutch at Under-20, Under-21 and senior level.

He has 21 senior Holland caps, making his debut against Turkey in September 2012, and featured five times under new Manchester United manager Van Gaal during the World Cup in Brazil where the Dutch finished third.

Talented: Janmaat first played for ADO Den Haag, before moving to Heerenveen and then Feyenoord

What is his club record like?

Solid and relatively impressive, if somewhat unspectacular.

Janmaat broke into the first team at ADO Den Haag in 2007, playing 33 games and scoring three times for the second-tier Dutch side.

The right-back was then snapped up by top-division outfit Heerenveen, where he spent four seasons, amassing 99 appearances and scoring on eight occasions. He was highly-regarded at the club and won the KNVB Cup - the Dutch equivalent of the FA Cup - in his first season.

Following his successful spell at Heerenveen, Janmaat moved to Feyenoord on a free transfer once his contract expired. He quickly established himself in the team and was rewarded for his displays with a debut for the Holland side. He made 74 appearances for Feyenoord, scoring five times.

All smiles: The 24-year-old is an attacking full-back and he is expected to fit straight into Newcastle's defence

Step-up? Janmaat has better league statistics than outgoing full-back Mathieu Debuchy had last season

How did he do last season?

Last season Janmaat played extremely well for club side Feyenoord in the Dutch Eredivisie, helping them to second place in the league.

In 30 league games, he scored twice and created five assists - showing the attacking threat he offers from full-back.

He also had an 81 per cent pass completion ratio and 85 per cent tackle success rate - both higher than the player he is replacing, Debuchy, enjoyed in the Premier League last season. 

Although he is not the biggest defender in the world, he is decent in the air and is unlikely to be muscled off the ball. 

Going Dutch: Janmaat played five times at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil for Holland under Louis van Gaal

What sort of player are Newcastle getting?

Alan Pardew is effectively getting a like-for-like replacement for the outgoing Debuchy.

Janmaat loves to get forward and he will attack at every opportunity, overlapping his winger and offering himself up in the opposition half.

He is extremely quick and is arguably a better defender than Debuchy as he covers the defence well and can sweep up opposition attacks. 

His attacking ability was shown during the third-place play-off during the World Cup when he overlapped well to expertly pass the ball to Georginio Wijnaldum to score the Dutch's third goal against Brazil. 

Looking up: Janmaat is quick and is likely to excite the St James' Park faithful with his overlapping runs

Any weaknesses?

No obvious weaknesses that make him a liability, but his desire to attack has on occasion left a gap at right-back that the opposition can exploit.

He is not weak but he is not the strongest so it may take him a little bit of time to adapt to the pace and power of the Premier League, although the Eredivisie has many similarities and so that should not be a problem long-term.

Where will he fit in at Newcastle?

He will slot straight in at the right-back slot vacated by Debuchy, who has left for Arsenal for £10m.

Janmaat will be Pardew's first choice and he will likely be accompanied in defence by captain Fabricio Coloccini, Mike Williamson and Massadio Haidara.

How did he end up in the North-East? 

Despite impressing during his time at Feyenoord, challenging for the Dutch title was not the height of his ambitions - Janmaat has described the transfer to Newcastle as the 'perfect move' for him right now.

The full-back has been linked with Juventus and Arsenal in the past - as well as Manchester United due to the Van Gaal connection - and Janmaat confirmed he turned down interest from Italy to move to the North-East of England.
