An 11-year-old boy has been charged with homicide after a gun he was allegedly playing with went off and killed his 15-year-old friend.

The victim, DaVontae Ziegler, was outside on his front porch in Nashville with the 11-year-old and another 14-year-old boy during a school snow day on Friday.

Ziegler ran to get help at a neighbor's house after he was shot, but died from his injuries at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

An 11-year-old boy has been charged with homicide after a gun he was allegedly playing with went off and killed his 15-year-old friend DaVonte Ziegler 

The 11-year-old told investigators that the gun, which he said he found, fired accidentally while he was playing with it, according to police. 

Metro police spokesman Don Aaron said witnesses saw the 11-year-old check on his friend after the gun went off, but fled the scene before police arrived. 

The 11-year-old told police he disposed of the gun. It has not yet been found, according to Aaron.

DaVontae's aunt and uncle have been left devastated, both for the loss of the teenager they have raised since he was six weeks old and for the boy who could now face jail time.

Glenn Griswould said the 11-year-old often came by the house to play video games with DaVontae. 

'They were friends. I just know the little boy didn't do it on purpose,' he told the Tennessean.

Glenn and Amelia Griswould, DaVontae's aunt and uncle, have been left devastated - both for the loss of the teenager they have raised since he was six weeks old and for the boy who could now face jail time 

Amelia Griswould said she hopes the child doesn't receive a life sentence in prison for something that was 'an accident'. 

'That's two children whose life is gone,' she told KCTV5. 

'He's going to suffer just knowing that he killed his friend, and that's enough punishment for that child.' 

Mrs Griswould said she didn't want to feel anger towards the family, but that she 'can't feel sympathy for them right now'. 

'They gone took my child,' she told the Tennessean. 'All I know is my child is not coming home. I'm not going to have him wake up on Saturday mornings wanting pancakes.' 

Mrs Griswould also questioned why the 11-year-old's parents were unaware he had a gun. She told families to watch 'what your children are doing and getting into'. 

'So many gangs, so many adults just giving children guns for no apparent reason,' she told WKRN-TV. 

'And it's killing our children.'  

Mrs Griswould said she hopes the child doesn't receive a life sentence in prison. 'He's going to suffer just knowing that he killed his friend, and that's enough punishment for that child,' she said
