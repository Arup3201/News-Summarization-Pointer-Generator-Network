David Cameron has opted out of child benefit, it has been confirmed

David Cameron has opted out of child benefit, it was confirmed last night.

His spokesman said the Prime Minister’s circumstances were communicated to the taxman just before Christmas.

He and his wife Samantha were until today entitled to nearly £2,500 a year for their daughters Nancy and Florence and son Arthur.

Mrs Cameron, who once earned around £400,000 with the luxury stationers Smythson, has since drastically cut back her hours.

Chancellor George Osborne, who earns £134,565, yesterday announced he had cancelled the payments he has received since his son Luke, 11 and daughter Liberty, 9, were born.

He and his author wife Frances, who are worth around £4million, were until yesterday entitled to £1,752 per year. 

But the Chancellor said those households losing out are among the best off 15 per cent of the country, and it is fair they go without so the rest of claimants can carry on benefiting.

‘By spending less on welfare, we’re making further progress to that brighter future I want for my children and yours’, he wrote.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps, father of three young children, told Sky News yesterday he had ‘just filled in the form’ to opt out, and that those losing the income had to accept they were ‘in a somewhat better position than other people.’

He said: ‘I am one of the people who has been affected. I wouldn’t go as far as sharing the conversation between me and my wife, but I am sharing the pain and the truth is we need to be all in this together so we can get this deficit under control.’ 

Cabinet ministers have all been told to opt out of the benefit.

And Downing Street aides are understood to have told all Tory MPs to contact a special HMRC hotline over the weekend to check their circumstances.

An MP’s £65,000 salary puts them well beyond the cut-off point, however the complexity of the new system means they could carry on claiming if they use extra pension payments to bring their ‘adjusted salary’ below £60,000.
