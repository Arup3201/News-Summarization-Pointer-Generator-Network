North Korea will unveil a multimillion-dollar ski resort to demonstrate that the country - often painted as isolated and poverty-stricken - is as civilised and advanced as anywhere else.

Masik Pass, a winter wonderland of luxury chalets, ski runs and sleigh rides, will open to the public on Thursday despite facing a tumult of opposition from Swiss, Austrian and French resorts that refused to provide ski equipment.

It is billed as a key feature in the nation's bid to boost tourism as the economy flounders and 
civilians suffer one of the lowest standards of living in the world.

Multimillion-dollar project: They have set to building ski lifts themselves after Switzerland refused to provide theirs

The complex of ski runs, sleigh rides and luxury chalets are far from finished but will open on Thursday

While few North Koreans could afford a 
trip to Masik Pass, near the country's east coast, the leadership could offer visits as a reward for 
loyalty or exceptional work - although just 0.02 per cent of the population (5,500 people) can ski.

However, supreme leader Kim Jong-un - who fell in love with the sport at 
University in Switzerland - has blasted suggestions that it is just a 
playground for foreigners the elite in his nation of 24million people.

Masik's ski runs cut through the trees, down to two hotels - one eight-storey building for foreigners, and a smaller one for Koreans.

Propaganda stands at the base of a ski slope at Masik Pass. The sign reads: 'Full attack. March Forward. Let's Absolutely Finish Building Masik Pass Ski Resort Within This Year By Launching A Full Aggressive War and Full Battle'

The signs on the slope together reads 'Burning Hope'. North Korean authorities have been encouraging a broader interest in sports in the country, calling it 'the hot wind of sports blowing through Korea'

But three days from its opening, the site is running behind schedule, according to journalists who visited on a press trip late last month.

The 'pistes' are currently long stretches of bright-brown dirt dotted with rocks, weeds and patches of stubborn grass.

Standing clear among the rubble is a selection of brightly coloured propaganda posters as hundreds of 'soldier-workers' work on the land to the sound of patriotic music.

Despite the unfinished state of the resort, officials refuse to budge on the launch date of 10 October - the 68th anniversary of the Korean Workers' party - and workers are 'carrying out their daily quotas at more than 200 per cent,' according to local press.

Last month, the complex faced a set back when the Swiss government blocked plans for a company to sell North Korea $7.7m-worth (£4.8m) of lifts and cable car equipment because of new sanctions barring the sale of luxury goods to the North.

There will be a 250-room hotel for foreigners and a 150-room hotel for Koreans, 0.02% of whom can ski

Kim Jong-un's latest project comes as the South Korea Winter Olympics 2018 looms.

He offered the site to their neighbours as a hosting venue, explains Masik's ski chief Kim Tae-yong, but Seoul turned it down.

Now,
they have their sights set on turning Masik into a training centre to 
produce a North Korean world champion within a few years.

So far, it has won only two medals at the Winter Games – both in speed skating.

Austrian and French ski-lift manufacturers also have reportedly said no.

North Korea's state-run media branded the move a 'serious human rights abuse that politicises sports and discriminates against the Koreans'.

Ski chief Kim called it 'a pity', but said Masik Pass would have three functioning lifts this year.

'We can make nuclear weapons and rockets,' he said. 'We can build a ski lift.'

Planners foresee hordes of tourists driving to the resort after arriving by plane at a converted military airbase in the nearest city, Wonsan. The resort also has its own heliport.

It is part of Kim Jong-un's policy to use sport as an attraction for the nation.

Over the past few months, numerous recreational sports parks, basketball courts and inline skating rinks have been erected in Pyongyang.

'All of Wonsan will be turned into a tourist area,' Ri Ki Song, an economist for the Institute of Economy at North Korea's Academy of Social Science, said in a recent interview in the capital.

'It will have a big impact on the economy. We are now trying to build a lot of tourism sites, and skiing is the kind of sport that developed countries enjoy.

'It will also be a place for our own people to use.'
