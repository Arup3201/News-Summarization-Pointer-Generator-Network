The manager of the hazardous-materials company hired by City Hall to clean the apartment of New York's first Ebola patient is a former fraudster who was released from prison three years ago, it has emerged.

Salvatore Pane, the chief safety officer of Bio-Recovery Corporation - which sterilized the Harlem apartment of Dr Craig Spencer and The Gutter bowling alley in Brooklyn after Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola - has been revealed as a convicted criminal.

In 2010, Pane and his two mortgage companies 'engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, and illegal business practices that violated New York’s consumer protection and real property laws', according to a pleading filed by then-state attorney general Andrew Cuomo obtained by Buzzfeed News.

A State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan issued a permanent injunction against both companies and Pane was fined as a result.

Controversial: Salvatore Pane, the chief safety officer of Bio-Recovery Corporation, outside the apartment building of Dr. Craig Spencer on October 24

Cleanup: It has been revealed that Pane - widely photographed and interview in the wake of New York's first Ebola case - has a criminal past, but he says that does not affect his current work

Then Pane was sent to jail for nine months from June 2010 to March 2011 for first-degree aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle.

Pane - who has since changed the spelling of his name to Pain - was widely interviewed and photographed by the press in the wake of New York's first Ebola case.

City Hall has confirmed it was only made made aware of Pane's past dealings on Monday.

An official said the proper protocol was followed when choosing Bio-Recovery Corporation to handle the clean-up of the apartment and the bowling alley that Spencer had visited.

'We will continue to monitor the situation, provide any assistance our state and city partners request, and take any actions we deem necessary to protect the public interest,' the official told BuzzFeed News Friday

Ebola: Dr. Craig Spencer tested positive for Ebola one week after returning from Guinea, where he had been treating patients with the disease. In that week he visited Brooklyn's The Gutter, which had to be cleaned

After returning to New York City from Guinea, Dr. Craig Spencer was quarantined after showing symptoms consistent with the virus. This is his apartment on West 147th Street

The office of Mayor Bill de Blasio said Bio-Recovery Corporation has no future jobs lined up for the city

A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said the company 'has not received any further work from the city as we review this situation'.

In an interview with Buzzfeed, Pane said that his past had no connection with his current work and the effectiveness of his company.

'I hope I’ve done what I’ve had to do to rebuild my life,' he said.

'I’m not a bad guy.'

Pane does not own Bio-Recovery Corporation, which has been in business about 20 years.

The company played an major part during the Anthrax scare in 2001.

City documents say Bio-Recovery has been a contractor for city agencies for the last six years, but there is no standing contract, according to Buzzfeed.
