Soledad O'Brien said that she is confident in the face of speculation that she will be replaced in favor of a lighter morning show once CNN undergoes the predicted transformation that will come Jeff Zucker takes the reins.

'I'm fairly confident that I'm not going to be cooking salmon and doing fashion shows on CNN,' O'Brien said in a recent interview.

Former NBC boss Zucker is now in charge of CNN as the cable news channel had been floundering in the ratings for months.

The concern for O'Brien comes as she 
currently headlines the channel's morning program Starting Point from 
7am to 9am, but new theory poses that fellow CNN anchor Erin Burnett may
be moved from her evening show to an earlier position.

How long will it last? Soledad O'Brien began anchoring CNN's morning program Starting Point in January

Shakeup: Jeff Zucker supposedly thinks that 
Burnett is a ‘real talent’ and that she could be the one to end the 
ratings slump that has seen its breakfast program beaten even by HLN

Zucker supposedly thinks that Burnett 
is a ‘real talent,' despite her failure to gain much traction in prime 
time with her 7 pm show, eponymous Erin Burnett Out Front, and that she 
could be the one to end the ratings slump that has seen its breakfast 
program beaten even by HLN.

The plan would be to try and recreate 
some of the magic which Zucker did at NBC in the 1990s when he started 
Today on its 16-year run as the number one morning show.

That doesn't concern O'Brien, she 
claims, because she is excited to be working with him again since they 
both started out their careers at NBC.

'He was my boss years ago when I 
worked at the 'Today' show. I'm absolutely thrilled to have him back,' 
she said in an interview with the New York Times.

Not concerned: Soledad O'Brien says that she if not getting hung up with the speculation about the expected reshuffle at CNN following Zucker's placement

O'Brien made the switch from NBC to 
CNN in 2003 and she has been a part of their morning lineup ever since, 
starting with American Morning- then moved on to anchoring specials and 
appearing in other segments of the network's line up- and then anchored 
Starting Point since January of this year.

'Listen, I have been doing this gig 
for a while. People go crazy with speculation every time there’s a shift
in leadership. I can’t comment on every rumor, but so far I’ve read 
reports on me, Anderson, Piers, Ann Curry and Erin Burnett, and all 
that’s clear to me is that somebody’s busy dialing Page Six,' she said.

New talent: Should Zucker make move Burnett, left, to the morning slot, it could 
be a slap in the face to Soledad O’Brien, right, who only in January was made 
anchor of CNN’s Starting Point, which runs from 7am to 9am

Burnett left NBC and its sister cable networks in 2011, when she was passed over for the Today show co-hosting gig in favor of Ann Curry. Ratings plummeted, Curry was dumped from the program this summer, and NBC replaced Curry with Savannah Guthrie, center left in purple. The Today show has fallen behind ABC since Guthrie joined

Whoever the leaker is, they appear to 
have pretty clear expectations for how the reshuffle will fall into 
place if Burnett moves to headline a morning show.

'He’ll 
team her up with a guy, and they’ll go after the audience watching Today
and Good Morning America,' the unidentified source tells The New York Post.

‘One thing Zucker knows how to do is a morning show.’

Burnett, 36, a former financial 
analyst, got her big break on CNBC hosting business show Street Signs 
and Squawk on the Street before joining CNN in 2011.

Erin Burnett OutFront show regularly 
gets twice as many viewers as she did on CNBC, but CNN is more widely 
available than CNBC and does broader interest news.
