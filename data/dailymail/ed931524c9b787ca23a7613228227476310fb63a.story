We are a nation obsessed with dieting – but we’re also fatter than ever.

The reason? Yo-yo dieting - which can mean some women lose up to 10 stone in a decade - but pile even more weight back on. 

Now, a Channel 5 documentary aired tonight uncovers the 
depressing truth of weight loss - that within one year of their diet, 80 per cent of people will gain weight, often more than they lost.

Struggle: Big Brother's Josie Gibson (before slimming to a size 10) admits she is obsessed with food. 'I love it, have no "off" button and lick the plate,' she tells a Channel 5 documentary airing tonight

Yo-yo: Big Brother's Josie Gibson has battled with her weight since she was six. She is now at her slimmest, a size 10, but admits she is terrified about piling the pounds back on - like 80 per cent of dieters

Determined: Josie (pictured) last week is one of many women who have previously piled the weight back on after dieting. She says her weight gain made her feel suicidal

In
 the programme, viewers follow Big Brother star Josie Gibson’s 
well-documented battle with yo-yo diets, meet 59-year-old Hayley whose 
weight has fluctuated for most of her life and Claudia, who has 
accepted the only way she will ever be thin is to ‘starve herself – and I
 can’t do that’.

All the women in the programme have lost weight – only to pile it all (and more) back on.

At 28 years old and a size 10, Josie is the slimmest she has ever been– but she admits it is a daily battle.

‘I
 am obsessed with food – I love it, have no “off” button and lick the 
plate,’ the Big Brother star tells the documentary.

‘At times I’ve been so desperate to stop eating that I’ve 
left the dinner table and gone and put a bikini on for 20 minutes,’ she
 confesses. ‘But it still doesn’t work.’

After appearing on Big Brother in 2010 she shed four stone – but piled it all back on when she broke her ankle.

Having
 worked so hard, she admits she felt suicidal about her weight gain – having 
battled with her figure since the age of six and ballooning to 19 stone 
by the age of 18.

‘People would text me saying “go and hang yourself, you whale” – it was horrific.' she says.

Over
 the years, she tried everything to shed the pounds – from fad diets to 
weight loss pills.

‘They were meant to flush out fat but left me with 
spag bol in my pants,’ she candidly tells viewers.

Now a svelte size
 10, she has thrown away her fat clothes and is studying to become a 
personal trainer in a desperate attempt to stay slim – given that fact 
she can ‘put on half a stone in weekend’.

She's
 not alone. We are a nation of yo-yo dieters, as so many of 
our celebrity friends such as Natalie Cassidy, Kerry Katona and Steps' 
Claire Richards prove.

In fact it's not unusual for a woman to
 lose 10 stone in a decade as her weight fluctuates.

The average diet lasts just five and a half weeks, and the average woman 
will embark on 61 diets in her lifetime and spend around 31 years of her
 life trying unsuccessfully to lose weight.

One such woman is 59-year-old Hayley Morris who has been on a diet for 
three-quarters of her life  - and even suffered a heart attack because 
of her weight. 

Addicted to yo-yo dieting: Viewers also meet Claudia Connell who has gone up and down six dress sizes over the last two decades. This is her at her thinnest

Struggle: Ms Connell admits the real reason for her weight gain is because she lacks willpower  - but also because 'it's very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight'

Like many women, she has lost weight – only to pile it back on and some more.

Over a 40-year-period she has lost 27 stone but ended up 10 stone heavier.

Aged 15, she was already 12 stone, going up to 26 stone at the age of 32. ‘I
 was addicted to food and this is what scuppered every diet. In the 
past, if I had any problem, my excuse was to overeat – it was the only 
thing in my life I could control at times.

‘I would also write off 
the whole day if it started badly food-wise. Breakfast tended to be four
 or five slices of toast, then more pasta and bread throughout the day. 
It was like an illness – but no-one to blame but myself.’

Now at the 
age of 59, after developing diabetes and suffering a heart attack, she 
is desperately trying to adopt a healthier lifestyle and she the pounds 
before her weight kills her.

Then there are the women who are addicted to the buzz yo-yo dieting gives them.

Diet disaster: Hayley Morris, 59, has ended up 10 stone heavier than when she started dieting

Claudia
 has gone up and down six dress sizes over the last two decades. She was
 a size eight until the age of 30, but then gained four stone over the 
next eight years. She then dropped to under eight stone before piling on
 the pounds to go up to a size 18.

She admits the real reason for her
 weight gain is because she lacks willpower  - but also because ‘it’s 
very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight’.

She 
explains: ‘There is that feeling of euphoria when you get down to a size
 12 or 14 that’s addictive. It wouldn’t be exciting if you could always 
fit into size 10 jeans.’

Despite this, she says she wanted to cry at 
pictures of herself looking ‘morbidly obese’ and is terrified of being 
‘the fat person on the bus taking up the seat’.

And like many failed
 slimmers, the list of diets she has tried is endless, ranging from 
cabbage, grapefruit to one that involved eating anything red – ‘I ended 
up eating fruit gums’, she admits.

Viewers also meet 23-year-old Gemma, whose mother was paying her to lose weight even when she was at primary school.

By the age of 11 she weighed a staggering 18 stone – and she’s been battling the weight ever since.

‘I
 go on crazy diets like the cup-a-soup one, where I lost two stone in a 
month – but I put it back on as soon as I finished,’ she says, now 
weighting 24 stone. ‘I am an emotional eater and it’s sticking with the 
diet that’s the problem.’

Claudia is having more success – but even she fears it will be short-lived.

‘I’ve
 lost one-and-a-half stone in two months, but I know I will put it back 
on,’ she admits. ‘Starvation is what it takes for me to be thin  - and I
 just can’t starve myself.’
