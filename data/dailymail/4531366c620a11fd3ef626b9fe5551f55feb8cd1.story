Manchester United's new defender Marcos Rojo returned from international duty with Argentina to prepare for his debut against QPR on Sunday.

Rojo is yet to play for his new club despite signing three weeks ago, due to work permit complications.

He has represented his country in that time, playing the full 90 minutes against Germany last week in the repeat of the World Cup final.

Eager: The United defender is keen to start playing for his new club and joining the other top signings

But the Argentine centre-back is now eligible for Louis van Gaal and is expected to start at Old Trafford this weekend.

'I am desperate to get onto the field and play because I have not been able to step onto Old Trafford [yet],' said Rojo, whilst on international duty with Argentina this week.

'My life has changed a lot. I am very happy to be at Manchester United, a top team in the world, sharing a dressing room with players like Wayne Rooney, Robin Van Persie, Angel Di Maria and now Radamel Falcao.

'This is a very important step in my career as a player and as a person. Everything that has happened to me since the World Cup has been a dream.' 

Delay: Rojo hasn't made his debut yet because work permit complications made him ineligible

Match fit: Despite his lack of club football Rojo managed 90 minutes for Argentina against Germany
