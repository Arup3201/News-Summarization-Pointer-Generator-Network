Mickey Arthur has been sacked as coach of Australia just 16 days before the start of the Ashes, with Darren Lehmann appointed as his replacement.

The South African has been the target of criticism in Australia both for the form of the team and the disciplinary issues which have dogged them in India and England.

Captain Michael Clarke has also resigned as a selector in the wake of Arthur's dismissal, believed to be as a show of support for the departed coach.

Some believe that Clarke's role as a 
selector - and the strain it puts on his relationships with the squad - 
has contributed to Australia's bad form. 

Cricket Australia CEO James 
Sutherland said, of Arthur's sacking: 'The timing is far from ideal but we didn’t feel we 
could sit back and hope matters would change without addressing issues 
critical to a high performing team culture.

'It obviously isn’t the type of 
change we want to make three weeks out from the Ashes commencing but we 
believe a change is needed.'

He continued: 'This has been a 
difficult decision to make but one that we feel is necessary. We are 
looking to establish a high performing Australian cricket team that is 
consistent over a period of time.

'To achieve that, we need all the parts moving in the right direction. Recent on-field results have been too inconsistent.

'Discipline, consistency of behaviour and accountability for performance are all key ingredients that need to improve. And we see that the head coach is ultimately responsible for that.

'The Cricket Australia Board decided yesterday that Mickey Arthur should not continue as head coach of the Australian cricket team.  In taking this decision, the Board accepted the recommendation to make an immediate change as being in the best interests of the team.'

Arthur said: 'Naturally I’m very 
disappointed with how this has all ended.  I certainly wanted to see the
job through but I accept that the team hasn’t been completely 
galvanised under my leadership and our performances have been 
inconsistent.

Yvette Arthur, his wife told Australia's Channel 9 news: 'He's absolutely shattered.

'He's an absolutely shattered man. He never saw it coming for one minute.

'He was so looking forward to the Ashes and working with the Test team again. He's just absolutely devastated.'

'I’m certainly a believer in good 
culture and traditions much like all Australians and feel we were 
starting to get a shift in the right direction. We certainly need the 
team to be absolutely unified if we’re any chance of beating the 
English.'

Sutherland continued: 'Darren Lehmann has been appointed as the new Australia head coach.  He has had outstanding success in a short time with Queensland Cricket winning the Bupa Sheffield Shield, Ryobi One-Day Cup and KFC T20 Big Bash League all within the last two years.

Lehmann will be contracted until June 2015 – post the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The Board considered him the outstanding candidate to drive the cultural change required in the team and to take it to the number one ranking in all formats of the game.

'No-one is underestimating the task at hand but we believe he is the right man for the job. It is up to the players to respond under his leadership and demonstrate their commitment to a successful Australian team.'

Sutherland also claimed that Clarke's decision to step down as a selector had been coming since the tour of India.

He explained: 'Being a team selector was proving to be a significant drain on Michael’s time and he sees this as distracting from his primary responsibilities as a player and as captain.

'The board unanimously supported Michael's request and believes that given the coaching change now is also the best time to enact this selection change as well.'

Clarke will continue to be consulted 'heavily' by the National Selection Panel on all team selection issues.

Gone: Arthur has been dismissed

Arthur was appointed as successor to Tim Nielsen in 2011 and was Australia's first overseas coach.

His
time in charge has been far from easy as Australia have struggled to 
replace retiring stars like Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey.

Perhaps
the nadir of Arthur's tenure came this March on the tour of India when 
vice-captain Shane Watson, Mitchell Johnson, James Pattinson and Usman 
Khawaja were disciplined for failing to make a presentation on how the 
team could improve, an incident which became known as 'homework-gate'.

Disciplinary issues continued to haunt
the team in England earlier this month when opener David Warner was 
suspended because of an attack on England batsman Joe Root in a bar.

To
compound matters, Australia finished bottom of their group in the 
Champions Trophy after suffering two defeats, including against Ashes 
opponents England.

With the first Test of back-to-back Ashes series beginning on July 10, the timing is undoubtedly a surprise.

But former Australia bowler Damian Fleming felt Arthur's position had grown tenuous since the tour of India.

He
told BBC Sport: 'I'm shocked at the timing [but] I would have thought 
he was on thin ice with the performances of the team on the field in the
last six months, particularly that disastrous Indian tour where we lost
4-0, but also what's been happening off the field.

'It
just shows for me that they're not united and for the leadership within
the Australian team, that's the biggest job, to make sure everyone's 
going in the right direction and that hasn't appeared to be happening in
the last six months.'

Should Lehmann be named as Arthur's replacement, he will take over at a key moment in Australian cricket, as they attempt to regain the Ashes having lost the last two Test series against England.

Lehmann has impressed since being appointed coach of Queensland.

Disorder and disarray: Australia have been performing badly and Arthur paid the price

Fleming said: 'Darren Lehmann was a fine Australian player, they love him up in Yorkshire, he's a legend there and he's done some good work for Queensland. He took over a couple of years ago, they've won the Sheffield Shield, the Big Bash.

'He's got the blend of being a fine Australian cricketer in his own right and you don't want to get on the wrong side of Boof (Lehmann).

'The only question for him is when you are coaching a new team you want to bring in your own structures. Is he going to be able to so that 20 days out from the Ashes? I don't think so.

'But I'd like an Australian coach and particularly one who's been a fine player like Darren Lehmann.'

Lehmann himself is no stranger to disciplinary breaches.

In 2003 he received a five-match ban from the International Cricket Council for a racial outburst after a game against Sri Lanka.
