Reality star Millie Mackintosh and Hackney-born rapper Professor Green are engaged.

The Made In Chelsea star, 23, tweeted a snap of her dazzling
engagement ring by Frost of London on Monday evening, with the touching caption: 'If I could scream loud
enough for the whole world to hear I would.'

Her ring is made up of a typically large rock set on double bands encrusted with diamonds.

Earlier in the day the brunette had told her Twitter followers that her beau whisked her away to 'her favourite restaurant in the whole wide world' - in the famously romantic city of Paris.

The couple have been dating for over a year, after the 29-year-old Professor - real name Stephen Manderson - became enamoured by the reality star when he saw her cover shoot for FHM two years ago.

By the end of 2011 he had her number and they debuted their relationship at the BRIT Awards 2012 ceremony.

At the beginning the longevity of the union was doubted by critics who said Quality Street heiress Millie 
was simply after 'a bit of rough' with her rapper boyfriend.

Long haul: The couple have been dating for over a year

Twitter love: Millie shared her news on the social networking site

Happy days: Professor Green's reaction to the news - sorry Jessica Alba, he is off the market

His response to her acceptance to his proposal on Tuesday was just two words on Twitter: 'Happy days.'

However,
the typically jovial rapper did send his sympathies to two Hollywood 
starlets who would undoubtedly be rather disappointed by his new 
relationship status.

He tweeted: 'Someone's gonna have to break the news to Jessica Alba and Eva Mendez (sic)'.

Luckily the rapper's DJ friend Lewis Richards offered to 'look after them now.'

For Millie, some of the first people to share their congratulations were her Made In Chelsea castmates.

Francis Boulle 
tweeted: 'Congratulations to @millsmackintosh and @professorgreen on 
their engagement. Nice ring. ;) #Weddingbells'.

As the CEO of a 
jewellery company, his reference to the ring could suggest he may have 
helped the Professor in the selection process.

Jamie Laing was far simpler with his excited message: '@professorgreen @millsmackintosh congratulations guys!!!! X'.

But it seems Millie and her new fiancé may have overdone the celebrating somewhat, with the reality star tweeting on Tuesday morning: 'Wow ive got a little bit of a headache this morning! #toomuchchampagne.'

The pair also set tongues wagging when they shared a broody picture of themselves cooing over a friend's baby over lunch.

However, in a recent interview, Millie admitted she is in no rush to start a family.

Doting: Millie sported a camouflage jacket with her tight leather trousers as she supported her beau at the gig

She said: 'Definitely no baby, not right now. Like any girl, I know I want a family one day, but I'm really focused on work at the moment.

'But Herby my dog has made me feel 
maternal. I love looking after people, but it's a lot of responsibility.
It's like a little taste of having a first child.'

Professor Green, who split from Hollyoaks 
actress Candy 
McCulloch in November 2011, admitted he had been seeing a lot of Millie 
before they made their public debut, but initially said he wasn't 
looking for 'anything serious'.

Happy: Pro Green and Millie (pictured here at this year's BRITs) often share snaps of their relationship on Twitter - and that even goes down to getting engaged

Loved up: The pair looked more than happy to pose up for photographers on the red carpet, with Millie even giving her beau a big kiss on the cheek at one point

He told The Sun newspaper: 'I don't want to be too tied down or get into anything serious too fast. But Millie is really fit.'

When Millie met Pro Green, she was overcoming heartache herself after she discovered her boyfriend Hugo Taylor 
had cheated on her with best friend Rosie Fortescue.

But
for the couple who have made no secret of their growing love for one 
another over Twitter, it was a definite fitting place for their happy 
announcement.
