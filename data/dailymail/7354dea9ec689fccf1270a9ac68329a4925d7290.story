By the time AP McCoy traipsed in, ninth in the first race of his last Cheltenham Festival, the acclaim for his great friend and rival was ringing in his ears.

The sound of rolling thunder from the crowd, packed 50-deep on The Lawns along the final two furlongs of the closing straight, concluded with Ruby Walsh’s name being chanted. Suddenly the people’s hero seemed quite incidental.

It was not to get a great deal better for the man who transcends National Hunt racing, and whose farewell to its biggest meeting dominated the build-up to this event.

AP McCoy rides Jezki to a disappointing fourth in the Champion Hurdle on day one of Cheltenham

In truth, McCoy has known plenty of days like this at Cheltenham before, and while he will have felt disappointment, his supporters in a record opening-day crowd of 63,000 had much to compensate them.

The thought of this Festival helps sustain some people through the long winter months and, when it finally arrived, it could hardly have been more glorious. Cleeve Hill almost shimmered in the background as springtime attempted its own burst to the front.

Amid the drama McCoy fought hard to try to fulfil the expectations placed upon him, perhaps more from a wider sporting public who have come to revere his sustained excellence.

The cognoscenti know that there is little low hanging fruit for him at Cheltenham this year, but there are still three days left to make this a fitting valedictory appearance. The fantasy ending remains victory on Friday, either in the Gold Cup or the meeting’s final race, which has been temporarily renamed in his honour.

He might be a far more sanguine character than when he first started racking up the champion jockey titles, but frustration was etched into his features as he went in and out of the weighing room. 

McCoy had considered Jezki (above) as his best chance of a winner at Cheltenham this year

You do not become the nation’s most durable sportsman without defeats continuing to sting.

On Tuesday these came in the form of finishing ninth, last, fifth, fourth and pulling up in his five races. It is a strange day when American Rich Ricci, uber-wealthy banker and the pantomime villain of racehorse ownership, gets more cheers in the parade ring than someone deemed a national treasure, but this was one of them.

McCoy has admitted that he is anxious about the prospect of retirement, but afternoons such as on Tuesday might serve to ease the fear.

No defeat hurt more than coming fourth on Jezki in the Champion Hurdle, and the horse’s trainer Jessica Harrington revealed he had been quick to take responsibility.

‘AP was blaming himself, saying he took on Faugheen at the top of the hill, and in chasing the winner it probably cost him second or third and he finished fourth,’ she said. ‘If he had ridden him to be second to Faugheen then he may well have been second.’

The latter scenario was never likely to happen, especially as McCoy had identified Jezki, the defending champion from last year, as probably his best chance in 2015.

He was not to add to his comparatively modest Festival tally of 30 winners, a total exceeded not just by Walsh but Barry Geraghty, too. He has tasted glory here — the Gold Cup win on Synchronised and the masterclass on Wichita Lineman in the 2009 William Hill — but it is 17 years since he was the leading jockey at this Bacchanalian jamboree.

McCoy, riding in his last Cheltenham Festival, did not have the day he would have hoped upon arrival

Some revellers had gone home as he set off in the last race, the exotically-named Chaps Restaurants Barbados Novices’ Handicap Steeplechase, on Bold Henry. They were never in it and pulled up with two fences left.

Afterwards McCoy had what looked like a lengthy inquest with the owner JP McManus before fairly sprinting back to the weighing room for the last time.

He was not in the mood to discuss the afternoon’s events, saying only ‘it was all right.’

Perhaps he could merely have pointed to the name of the horse who had started favourite and just come second in the final chase.

For AP it had been a Thomas Crapper kind of day.
