We all have days when we'd like to lose a little weight here or a love-handle there.

But one Lincolnshire geography teacher who spent 15 years unhappy with his size has been crowned a slimming champion after losing almost 11 stone in just one year.

A newly svelte James Pepper, 30, who lives in Market Deeping, says his family and friends no longer recognise him after his weight plummeted from 23st 13lb to 13st 6lbs.

Just last year, aged 29, Mr Pepper vowed to lose the weight as a 30th birthday present to himself.

He made the decision after realising he had been steadily gaining weight since the age of 15 and had been frustrated with his size for half his life.

Mr Pepper, who has been crowned Slimming World's Man of the Year 2012 at London's Ritz Hotel, said: 'I've had people I know walk past me in
the street. They're always really apologetic but I actually take it as a
huge compliment.'

Speaking about his dramatic transformation, Mr Pepper said: 'At 15 I was just a little bit overweight but I didn't do anything about it and I got bigger and bigger.

'Whenever
I felt unhappy, whether it was about my weight or something else, I'd 
cheer myself up by buying something nice to eat like a cake or a pie.

'It
carried on like that for the next 15 years. I always knew I needed to 
do something about my weight but I didn't know what, so I'd put it to the back of my mind.'

Now you see him...and now you don't: Geography teacher James Pepper, left, before losing the weight, and now, right, almost 11 stone lighter and 'finally fit at 30'

Mr Pepper, who is single, eventually decided to tackle his weight problem when one of his friends asked how he was planning to celebrate his 30th birthday.

He said: 'That was the trigger 
because I realised then that I'd been unhappy with my size for half of 
my life.

'I asked my 
colleague Caroline, who had lost a lot of weight, about the Slimming 
World group she went to and agreed to go with her.

'She was delighted 
because she got a free week for bringing along a new member!'

The teacher signed up to the programme - which promotes healthy eating and meal plans - in June 2011 and lost five stone before the school holidays were over.

When he returned to the classroom with his new, smaller body he received rapturous applause from his pupils.

By his 30th birthday in September Mr Pepper had 
dropped six stone.

He said that before going to his first Slimming World meeting he was really nervous as he had the impression there would be lots of women in the group.

'And to be fair 
there was, but they were all really welcoming and friendly'.

He says the 
biggest change is learning to plan his meals: 'I never used to think 
about what I'd have for dinner until I was on my way home, which means 
I'd pick up a takeaway or grab something quick and easy - and usually 
unhealthy - from the supermarket.

'Since
joining Slimming World I enjoy cooking meals from scratch, my favourite
is homemade burgers and potato wedges with salad.

'Food
isn't my comfort blanket anymore either, although I do have an 
emergency Curly Wurly in my classroom - but so far I'm one of the few 
teachers who hasn't broken it out.'

Mr Pepper revealed that another secret to his dramatic weight-loss was becoming more active.

Last year he began walking more, and he also went swimming for the first time in 12 years.

He said: 'As a 
geography teacher I go on lots of trips. I used to huff and puff my way 
up mountains, following the kids while someone else led, but now I'm 
first off the bus and charging up the hill.

'The
kids at school have been really supportive and asked lots of questions,
someone even asked if they could write a magazine article on me for 
their coursework which was very flattering.

'I
think it's important to be honest with them and I always say I wish I'd
done something at their age, but at least I can say I finally got fit 
at 30.'
