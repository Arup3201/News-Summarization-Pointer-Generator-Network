They gave me my life back: Kirsty said she is thankful every day to her lung donor

A woman’s life has been transformed after having a double lung transplant.

Kirsty Gedes, 28, who was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was nine months old, received the organs in 2009.

The make-up artist from Lanarkshire has since managed to scale Ben Nevis in Scotland.

She said: 'There isn’t a single day goes by that I don’t think of, and thank, my donor ... not one. That person gave me my life back.

'This person signed a piece of paper and saved me. When I got the call about the transplant in November 2009, the day after my birthday, I said that nothing will ever top it. It’s an amazing gift.

'I was fortunate Cystic Fibrosis didn’t get its claws into me, so to speak, until my teenage years.

'It is a very slow progressive illness, so you don’t realise how much is taken away from you until you can no longer walk or you have to completely rely on people.'

Kirsty went to university but had to drop out a year later after becoming extremely ill. She was warned if she didn't concentrate on her health she could die as her lung function had dropped to 35 per cent.

'From the age of 24 onwards my life was not my own anymore, it was taken by Cystic Fibrosis,' she said.

In 2008, Kirsty, who lives in Glenboig, Lanarkshire, with boyfriend, Dougie Harvey, 27, had a massive lung collapse, in what she described as the scariest moments of her life. She then suffered two more collapses and her lung capacity fell to 25 per cent.

She said: 'That’s when I was told the transplant needed to happen.'

She spent eight months on the transplant list and required around 60 pills a day and oxygen and a ventilator at night. However, she still managed to continue studying hairdressing at college.

She said: 'The eight months passed in a bit of a blur. You have to put life on hold, you have no choice in that, but I always stayed positive.

'My mum used to say ‘If you give up I’m going to kill you’.'

Then in November 2009 she had the call from Freeman's Hospital in Newcastle to let her know they had found suitable lungs. She had the transplant in a seven-hour operation.

Just days later Kirsty was able to cycle
 on an exercise bike for 50minutes and she hasn't looked back. She has 
raised thousands of pounds for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.

Climb every mountain: Kirsty managed to reach the top of Ben Nevis at 4,409ft

Kirsty spends alot of time raising awareness about organ donation after a double lung transplant saved her life

She said: 'I climbed Ben Nevis did that a month ago, which was brilliant and very emotional - I cried a lot going up, it’s something I never dreamed I would be able to do.

'I’ve also taken part in three 10Ks, even though I hate running! I do it because I can raise awareness and money for charity.

'I said my donor’s name while I was doing it, things like ‘We have to keep going’. In the run-up to the finish line I’m sobbing my eyes out because I’m so happy and thankful.

'I have so many things to be thankful for and I’m so grateful to have the chance to watch my nieces and nephew - Caitlin, 13, Tamsyn, 11 and six-year-old Joshua - grow up.'
