A drunk passenger attempted to open a plane door on a Ryanair flight to Dublin after mistaking it for a toilet.

Tomasz Mucha, 26, drunk vodka and beer to calm his nerves on what was his first ever flight when he made the error.

Shocked passengers looked on as Mucha, of no fixed abode, tried to open the rear door on the Boeing 737.

He managed to get the door handle up, but the air pressure on board the aircraft prevented him from doing so, Dublin District Court heard.

Ryanair cabin crew immediately escorted Mucha - who was said to be drinking his own beer on the flight - back to his seat, and he was arrested upon arrival in Ireland.

Garda Shaun Cafrrey told the court he arrested Mucha, who he said was not violent, at Dublin Airport.

Judge James Faughnan asked the accused: 'Do you realise how serious it could have been?' to which Mr Mucha replied: 'Yes', according to the Irish Mirror.

Mucha, who was travelling from Krakow on the July 11 flight, admitted being drunk on an aircraft and using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour.

He was fined £160
