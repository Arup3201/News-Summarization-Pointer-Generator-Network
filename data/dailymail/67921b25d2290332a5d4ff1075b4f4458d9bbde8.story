The City of Fort Worth has halted all demolitions after the wrongful destruction of two houses came to light recently.

City contractors tore down a dwelling not scheduled for demolition at Lagonda Drive, then the very next day tore down the wrong house on the wrong property on Watercress Drive.

The city has released a statement admitting the error, and has halted all demolitions until the cause of the two errors can be found and officials can ensure the mistake does not occur for a third time.

Vacant lot: The two dwellings that belonged to a family at Lagonda Drive have now disappeared, leaving behind only empty land

'It was human error,' Fort Worth spokesperson Bill Begley told reporters.

'There were two different types of human error.'

The first wrongful demolition was only discovered after the owners of the second property at Watercress Drive alerted authorities.

On July 11, a structure that was damaged by fire was razed by Garrett Demolition, a contractor for the City of Fort Worth.

The house was scheduled for demolition - but an undamaged smaller dwelling behind it not part of the demolition order was also torn down.

Razed: This small house containing years of family history and possessions was mistakenly torn down by Fort Worth city contractors

Scheduled: This main home was damaged in a fire and the city had permission to demolish it

Overzealous: Anchonda, one of the the Lagonda Drive property owners, was devastated to find city contractors had pulled down a building not on the demolition order

According to NBC 5, the work order only detailed the destruction of the first home with pictures and a site map of the one home.

The second building contained family photographs, keepsakes and other property belonging to the owners of the buildings. 

Property owner Juanita Anchonda said her family hadn't complained to the city about the mistake earlier because they didn't believe there was anything they could do.

'I didn't call anyone. It's just that I thought there's nothing you can do,' Anchonda told the Star-Telegram.

'It seemed like if they did it, they must've had authority to do it. So what can you do, if they did it, what can you do?'

Puzzled: David Underwood and his wife were perplexed when they drove to their property at Lake Worth but couldn't find their house

Anchonda said many family possessions were lost when the house got knocked down on July 11.

'My mom's stuff, her clothes, her shoes, her boots. Everything. Her pictures, my grandma's pictures,' Anchonda said.

This destruction wasn't noted by the city until the owner of a second property that was knocked down on July 12 alerted authorities to the error.

David Underwood was the owner of a large, three-bedroom, ranch-style home in Silver Creek. The house once belonged to his grandmother and Underwood and his wife intended to renovate the property and eventually move in.

Foundations: A concrete slab is all that remains of the three-bedroom home overlooking Lake Worth that belonged to the Underwood family

Dilapidated: The rundown house next door to the Underwood's home that had been scheduled for demolition since January

The Underwoods took a drive out to visit their property recently - but they couldn't find it.

'We came around Silver Creek looking for the lot and my wife said, "David, I think the house is gone,"' Underwood told Fox FW.

'We looked up there and sure enough, it's gone!'

Their house overlooking a lake at 9708 Watercress Drive had disappeared, with only a smooth concrete slab remaining to indicate where the property once stood.

The house that was actually supposed to be torn down was next door at 9716 Watercress Drive, and had been scheduled for demolition since January and bore all the signs of dilapidation, with broken windows and untended lawn.

'I just seen an excavator tearing that house down and I was wondering 
why,' neighbor Stephen Neumann told CBS.

Empty: The City of Fort Worth has said it will compensate the two property owners for the mistake that cost them their homes and possessions

Marked: The letterbox is all the remains of the home which was wrongfully demolished at 9708 Watercress Drive

'It was a pretty good house, it wasn’t all that 
bad, when this one next door has been needing tearing down for years.' 

'There is a common thread,' Begley said. 

'It was the same contractor with the same code supervisor in charge and the same code supervisor on site.  That said, in both instances there were honest mistakes made. And that’s why we’re putting policies in place to ensure we have safeguards. At Lagonda the contractor took it a step too far, at Watercress we had a city staffer inappropriately mark the house. So in both instances there was a human error.'

According to CBS, the code compliance employee is on paid administrative leave during an investigation into the incidents.  The contractor did not respond to a request for a statement.Begley said the city is working to 'do what is right' for the property owners. 

Underwood, who works to build community centers in disadvantaged neighborhoods, has graciously accepted the turn of events.

'I see so much around here, people that need help and have less that, it’s an accident, let’s do what’s right and move on,' he told Fox 4.
