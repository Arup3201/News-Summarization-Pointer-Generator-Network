David Cameron has distanced himself from Boris Johnson's controversial suggestion that one in six people is too stupid to get on in life.

The Prime Minister, speaking for the first time about the London Mayor's remarks, said he believed in equality of opportunity for all.

In a speech last week, the Mayor, seen as one of Mr Cameron's chief rivals for the Conservative leadership, said equality was unachievable when 16 per cent of the 'species' have an IQ of under 85.

His remarks prompted a storm of criticism, with Deputy Prime Minister branding them 'careless' and 'unpleasant' and accusing him of talking about people like dogs.

Some critics have suggested the row will dent Mr Johnson's chances of succeeding Mr Cameron and help ensure Home Secretary Theresa May does so instead.

Mr Cameron and his key ally George Osborne appear to be revelling in Mr Johnson's discomfort.

Speaking on a trip to China, the Prime Minister made clear he disagreed with the Mayor.

'I let Boris speak for himself,' the Prime Minister said. 'I think it's very important that we make sure we do everything so that we maximise people's opportunities to make the most of their talents.

'I believe in equality of opportunity. No-one should be held back by not being able to get the training, the education, the skills that they need. Everyone has their own way of putting these things and I'll leave Boris to talk to Boris.'

Delivering last week's Margaret Thatcher Lecture – staged by the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies think-tank – Mr Johnson insisted the rich had a duty to help the poor and embrace philanthropy.

And he urged the Government to do much more to help bright children from poor homes to get a good education.

He called for the reintroduction of John Major’s assisted places scheme, which paid for the brightest poor children to go to public schools – and accused the Tories of hypocrisy for blocking a revival of the grammar school system.

But his most controversial comments came when he said globalisation was intensifying the trend towards inequality.

Mr Johnson said: ‘I am afraid that violent economic centrifuge is operating on human beings who are already very far from equal in raw ability, if not spiritual worth.

‘Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely  relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130.

‘The harder you shake the pack, the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top. And for one reason or another – boardroom greed or, as I am assured, the  natural and God-given talent of boardroom inhabitants – the income gap between the top cornflakes and the bottom cornflakes is getting wider than ever.

‘I stress I don’t believe that economic equality is possible. Indeed, some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.’ 

Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister condemned the comments for revealing a 'fairly unpleasant, careless elitism' that siuggested giving up on 'a whole swathe of our fellow citizens'.

He added: 'To talk about us as if we are a breed of dog, a species he called it... I think the danger is if you start taking such a deterministic view of people and start saying they’ve got a number attached to them, in this case an IQ number, somehow they’re not really going to rise to the top of the cornflake packet...

'That is complete anathema to everything I’ve always stood for in politics, which is, yes of course, you shouldn't aspire - and as an old-fashioned Liberal I don’t aspire to a perfectly homogenous society where everyone has the same kind of outcomes but you’ve got to try and do more to instil greater opportunity in society.'

And yesterday Chancellor George Osborne joined the chorus of disapproval. 'I wouldn't have put it like that. I don't agree with everything he said,' Mr Osborne said.

'You can't achieve equality of outcome but you should be able to achieve equality of opportunity. Education is, I think, the best key to this.'

Mr Johnson appeared to echo the film character Gordon Gekko (pictured), whose notorious motto was 'greed is good', saying that greed was 'a valuable spur to economic activity'

ON INTELLIGENCE

‘Whatever
you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a  
conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species 
have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130.’

ON GREED

‘I
don’t believe that economic equality is possible. Indeed, some measure 
of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with 
the  Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.’

ON THE RICH

‘I
hope that this time the Gordon  Gekkos of London are conspicuous not 
just for their greed ... as for what they give and do for the rest of 
the population.’

ON GRAMMARS

‘I
remember once sitting in a meeting of the Tory shadow education team 
and listening with mounting disbelief to a conversation in which we all 
agreed solemnly that it would be political madness to try to bring back 
the grammar schools ... most of the people in that room were about to 
make use, as parents, of some of the most viciously selective schools.’

ON IMMIGRATION

‘It’s
time to sort out the immigration system so that we end the madness ... 
we are claiming to have capped immigration by having a 60 per cent 
reduction in New Zealanders, when we can do nothing to stop the  entire 
population of Transylvania –  charming though most of them may be – from
trying to come here.’
