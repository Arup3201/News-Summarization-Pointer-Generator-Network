On Saturday she caught the eye at the society wedding of the year. But Pippa Middleton has taken a few days to recover, it seems.

On Sunday she was pictured in a less-than-flattering outfit as she carried home her groceries. And yesterday she still appeared to have bags under her eyes as she sat in the Royal Box at Wimbledon.

Onlookers also noted that it appeared to be the second time in 72 hours that the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister had worn an outfit inspired by model Kelly Brook.

She wore a black and white Tabitha 
Webb dress as she attended the wedding of Lady Melissa Percy and Thomas 
van Straubenzee on Saturday.

The ensemble – which was widely 
praised – was the same as that worn by Miss Brook, 33, for an appearance
on TV’s Celebrity Juice last month.

The following day, as she returned 
from the shops in West London, Miss Middleton was pictured in a coral 
cashmere dress and cardigan combination that looked better suited to a 
woman much older than her 29 years.

In the Royal Box yesterday, she wore 
dark glasses for much of her time, but when she removed them her eyes 
told the story of someone apparently still recovering from a good 
weekend.

She was in a pale blue Sandro dress – a
look also previously worn by Miss Brook – as she sat with her younger 
brother James watching Roger Federer, and later Andy Murray, sweep to 
victory.

The siblings took centre stage in the 
box, which also included the Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, former
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, racing driver Sir Jackie 
Stewart, actress Felicity Kendal, Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis 
and defending Wimbledon doubles champion Jonny Marray.

Miss Middleton, a familiar face at the
All England Club, is well known for her love of tennis and recently 
compiled a short guide to the tournament.

Writing in the latest edition of 
Vanity Fair, she urged women visiting Wimbledon to abandon high heels 
and not to make plans in the evening in case a match runs on.

‘There’s nothing worse than having to 
leave Rafael Nadal’s athleticism for a routine pizza with friends,’ she 
said – although sadly for her there is no longer any risk of that this 
year.

Miss Middleton, who dreamt of becoming
a Wimbledon tennis champion as a child, has also described queuing with
older sister Kate on ‘people’s Sunday’ in 2004 to get tickets for 
Centre Court.

She said in Vanity Fair: 'One of my 
favourite Wimbledon experiences was queuing from 5am on People's Sunday 
in 2004 with my sister for three hours and getting £35 tickets on Centre
Court - my first time ever.'

Miss Middleton, who is currently 
dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 35, said when she was little she 
imagined if she ever married it would be in tennis whites.

But she forewent the colour today to 
wear the Brook-inspired blue ensemble as she smiled and clapped as the 
game progressed with Federer winning in three straight sets.

Andy Murray's mother, Judy, was also 
in place ready to cheer her son on as he took to the court later in the 
day to open his campaign in the grand slam.

The British number one has promised to
'give everything' in his quest for the Wimbledon title this afternoon 
when he faces Germany's Benjamin Becker.

Murray took to Twitter ahead of his opener to express gratitude to his fans for their backing and encouragement.

'I’ll give everything I have on the court starting with round one', he wrote.

The Scot hopes he can make Wimbledon 
history this year and become the first British man to take the Wimbledon
trophy since Fred Perry in 1936.

Miss Middleton was seen sharing a joke
with Prince Michael, the Queen's cousin, and his wife and her brother 
took their places in the Royal Box.

She had on Saturday joined Princes 
William and Harry at the wedding of Lady Melissa and Mr Straubenzee in 
Alnwick, Northumberland.

Residents lined the streets to watch guests make their way from the castle to the parish church for the wedding.

Miss Middleton was greeted at the church gates by cries from the crowd of ‘beautiful’.

After the service she joined 500 
guests for a celebration at the bride’s 1,000-year-old ancestral home, 
which has doubled for Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films.
