Italian financial market jitters worsened today as workers angry about austerity reforms went on strike and staged nationwide rallies.

Fiat's car plants stood idle and a performance at La Scala opera house in Milan was cancelled as unions kicked off the first in days of walkouts and demonstrations against spending cuts and tax increases.

Confidence dipped, with Milan's stock index down two per cent and the benchmark 10-year bond yield rising 0.52 of a percentage point to 6.76 per cent.

It comes after Greek government figures warned talks with international debt inspectors on a second bailout package were 'difficult and critical'.

Italy managed to raise €7billion in a bond auction, though the relatively strong demand was boosted by a bank association waiving fees to buy them.

Investors remain worried about the future of both Italy and the wider 17-nation eurozone, despite an EU deal last week to tighten controls on spending.

While that deal will boost longer-term budget discipline, it does little to lower the current debt.

The
Italian government's efforts to stabilise its finances, boost growth 
and lower debt - which stands at 120 per cent of GDP - have come under 
fire from unions.

Workers joined rallies in several labour sectors to protest about pension reforms earlier today.

It was the first in a series of 
walkouts called over the emergency austerity measures which Prime 
Minister Mario Monti insists are vital to avert financial disaster.

Metalworkers,
including on assembly lines at Fiat's car factories, were staging an 
eight-hour strike, while others planned to walk off the job hours before
the end of their shift.

The first draft of a new fiscal treaty for the eurozone and nine other EU countries will be ready by next week.

The head of legal services for the European Council briefed EU ambassadors at a meeting earlier today, an EU diplomat has revealed.

'(He) told the 27 ambassadors this morning that a first draft will be ready by the end of the week, at the latest early next week,' he said.

Twenty-six EU member states - apart from Britain - agreed on Friday that would pursue deeper fiscal integration as part of efforts to overcome the debt crisis.

Several non-euro countries, including Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic, still need parliamentary approval before they can give their full backing.   

The aim is to have the intergovernmental treaty signed by March next year, and have it ratified by all countries, apart from Britain, by June.

The European Central Bank cut back its purchase of government bonds to €635million last week - underlining its determination to limit support for indebted governments.

That compares to €3.66billion last week, and €8.58billion the week before that.

The purchases are a key tool in fighting Europe's debt crisis, because they tend to lower the borrowing costs faced by indebted governments such as Italy, the recent focus of the continent's debt crisis.

But the ECB, the chief monetary authority for the 17 countries that use the euro, has kept the purchases limited despite calls from many economists to buy more.

The bank says countries should take the politically difficult steps to get their finances under control themselves - such as cutting spending and raising taxes - and not wait for support from the central bank.

Public transport unions have called strikes for Thursday and Friday, with yet more action likely to take place next week.

Mr Monti's government, which took 
office last month, is urging Parliament to swiftly pass his rescue plan,
which includes investing €10billion in austerity savings in 
infrastructure to boost growth.

Labor
Minister Elsa Fornero has said some pension reforms might be softened, 
but that overall spending cuts must remain for the country to regain 
credibility on financial markets.

Italy
is under pressure to cut its €1.9 trillion public debt amid worries 
that persistently high borrowing costs will make it unable to turn over 
the debt with new bonds.

Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos met representatives of the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, this morning.

He said: 'The discussions are difficult and critical. The country must take very important decisions. There is no room for any evasion.'

Greece was granted a first bailout in 2010 after years of government overspending.

But it soon became clear that a second deal was needed, although the details remain to be fully worked out.

Greece is heading for a fourth year of recession, amid high taxation and growing unemployment.

Mr Venizelos added: 'The recession is worse than any prediction. We are in our third successive year of recession and heading to a fourth.

'For this to end the atmosphere must change: banks must feel secure, and we must fully fulfill the decisions of October 26.'

He has insisted no new austerity measures would have to be taken next year, provided the country fully implements those it has already committed to.
