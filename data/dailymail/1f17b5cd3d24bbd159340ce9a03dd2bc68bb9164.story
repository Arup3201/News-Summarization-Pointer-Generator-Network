It is one way to get between two of the planet’s most fabled seaside destinations – but not necessarily one that many travellers would choose.

After all, if you are going to make the journey between California and Hawaii, there are plenty of planes which cover the distance while you gaze out of the window.

We made it, boys! The adventurers leap into the ocean off Honolulu after completing their monster voyage

And if you want to cross (the western half of) the Pacific the easy way, many a cruise operator will also be happy to give you a leisurely lift.

But rowing? That might be quite hard work.

Not that this matters to a group of British university friends who have just entered the record books after rowing from America’s west coast to its celebrated Pacific state.

Jack Carter, Nick Kempster, Chris Blacketer and Mark Gleeson set off from Monterey, on the central coast of California, on 9 June.

They rowed around 1000 miles each, battling against howling winds – which, on occasion, resulted in waves in the shark-infested waters reaching more than 20ft in height.

Almost there: The quartet bask in the moment as they make it to Oahu

The four Britons, who all met at the University of Exeter, have now reached their final destination – the Hawaiian capital Honolulu on the island of Oahu.

All aged 24, they are the youngest crew to ever row the distance, which is known as 'The Great Pacific Race'.

The friends had spent a year preparing for the epic adventure, and almost two months on board the 24ft ocean rowing boat, called Isabel.

Using nothing but muscle power, the men rowed in pairs, rowing in two-hour shifts over the course of 50 days – travelling 3,100km (1927 miles).

They have so far raised more than £40,000 for the NOMAN Campaign, which raises awareness of HPV, a carcinogenic virus which causes five per cent of cancer cases worldwide, and infects one third of the UK population.

Chris Blacketer, from Ewell, Surrey, says: ‘Each day our hands got a little more blistered and our stomachs decreased in size, which was definitely a good thing looking at some of the pre-departure photos.

‘But the worst aspect by far was the pain in our backsides.

Cocktail hour: After such a feat of endurance, the boys have definitely earned a drink

‘Spending pretty much 24 hours a day either sitting or lying on them, meant we were all on a constant stream of painkillers just to get through the days and be able to sit down, as we were just so blistered and raw.’

They had originally hoped to complete the challenge within 40 days, but were affected by bad weather and unfavourable winds, which pushed them south rather than west.

Nick Kempster, from Bath, said: "This challenge has been immense, and at times it felt like we might not be able to complete it.

‘Everyone's support and messages, as well as our ultimate aim of raising awareness of HPV, have kept us going even when we didn't think we could give anymore.

‘Somehow we always found the strength to keep rowing.’

Scars of battle: Every one of those 2,000 miles is written into the quartet's hands

Mark Gleeson, from Orpington, added: 'fter spending nearly eight weeks in a world less than 24 foot in length, Hawaii seems impossibly large.

‘We're in a lot of pain, and have been for a few weeks now. We are barely able to sit, let alone stand, but everyone is so proud of one another.’
