A mother has been threatened with a fine and criminal record for taking her terminally ill son out of school for what could be his final holiday.

Maxine Ingrouille-Kidd, 56, wanted to take Curtis, 13, a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy, on the trip of a lifetime after doctors said he could die between the ages of 14 and 19.

The mother-of-three was due to take her son on a cruise during this October's half-term holiday, but she had to move it because the ship wasn't equipped to handle his needs.

Precious time: Maxine Ingrouille-Kidd wants to take Curtis on holiday before he dies

So she changed the date to later in October and requested a holiday form from the school.

However, she was left 'flabbergasted and shocked' when the mainstream school, with provisions for special needs, refused and told her she could be fined or face a criminal record.

Mrs Ingrouille-Kidd, from Wedmore, Somerset, told The Sunday Times: 'My son is 14 in October. This could well be his last holiday.

'Curtis is a quadriplegic, has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and is registered blind. He is never going to have a career, he is going to spend the rest of his life with us looking after him.

'The only relaxation he can get is swimming, so a cruise ship with a pool where he can also enjoy the sensory motion of a boat is ideal for him.

'I asked for a holiday request form from the school but was absolutely shocked and flabbergasted when the response was "no".

Exceptional case: Curtis is due to go on holiday with his mother in October but his school has said she will be fined

'It's the thought that I might be committing a crime that upsets me. I am a law-abiding citizen and this has been very stressful.'

Mrs Ingrouille-Kidd, who runs a nursery in Wedmore, has been working all summer while other staff members take holidays, so that her trip could coincide with her silver wedding anniversary to husband Peter, and Curtis's birthday.

One of her elder sons took to Facebook to share the problem, with other friends and parents lending their support.

Mrs Ingrouille-Kidd added: 'People were saying they would set up a JustGiving page to pay our fines but the fines are not the problem.'

John Osman, the leader of Somerset county council, said: 'This case does sound like exceptional circumstances. I am keen to talk to the headteacher... to make sure they understand the circumstances.'

The Department of Education added: 'We have been clear that all headteachers are free to grant pupils leave in exceptional circumstances.'

Mrs Ingrouille-Kidd isn't the first to fall foul of the strict holiday rules, which were introduced by the former education secretary Michael Gove.

Maeve Flanagan, from Bracknell in Berkshire, was fined £120 for taking her son to a family wedding in September, with an additional £150 being added when she failed to pay on time - because she had been referred for ovarian cancer.

Jason Short, from Plymouth, was fined for taking his daughter out of school because it was the only time he could get off work. He had booked it 12 months in advance and was told it was okay.

However, when the rule changes came in, he returned from his holiday to find a letter saying he would be fined £60.

More than 200,000 people have signed a petition against the policy on the 38 Degrees website.
