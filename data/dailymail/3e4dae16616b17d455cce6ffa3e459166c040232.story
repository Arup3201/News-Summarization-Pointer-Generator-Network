Sluggish broadband: Internet users are receiving an average of five megabits per second less than they are shelling out for

Internet users are receiving an average of five megabits per second (Mbps) less than they are shelling out for.

The huge 42% gap has been revealed by a new survey of more than 3,000 people, whose broadband speeds were tested over three days.

TalkTalk and Sky subscribers are having to put up with a massive 60% difference - the largest between an advertised speed and the sluggish service customers are actually receiving.

TalkTalk customers said they were promised 30 Mbps but were receiving only 5 Mbps, while Sky users are getting just 4.8 Mbps instead of the 12 Mbps they are paying for.

Virgin's online users report a 41% gap, having been promised 30 Mbps but only receiving 17.7Mbps.

Other complaints reported by the Guardian survey include broadband black spots in city centres, exposed copper lines that fail in poor weather and having to move businesses out of homes because of slow connections.

Top of the pile is BT, whose customers pay for 8 Mbps and get 2 Mbps less, with those signed up to its budget Plusnet option experiencing a 27% gap.

'If you were buying a dozen apples and you got three, you wouldn't put up with it,' said Hugh Colvin, an arts organiser who lives by the Welsh border.

Mr Colvin, who pays for two telephone lines so multiple family members can surf the internet at once, added: 'It's outrageous that I pay the same as somebody who is in the middle of London getting 10 times the speed.'

Civil servant David Combe, from Basingstoke, who shares his BT line with his partner and two children, said: 'If anyone wants to watch iPlayer there is no point a second person going online. It's like sharing a bathroom.'

Changes to advertising rules, which came int force in April, mean internet service providers can only claim 'up to' speeds if at least 10% of customers are actually receiving them.

Bandwidth: TalkTalk users are promised 30 Mbps but recieve only 5 Mbps

The threshold has been criticised for being too low but more and more broadband companies are using individual quotes instead of advertising blanket speeds.

TalkTalk said no one agrees a contract without receiving a speed estimate tailored to them, while BT said it removed blanket claims from its website in April and has been providing personalised quotes for years.

A Sky spokesman said the company emphasises its unlimited download allowances instead of headline speeds and stressed all the evidence shows customers are very positive about the service.

A Virgin Media spokesman said it has long argued for greater clarity in broadband advertising but added providers continue to hide behind catch-all claims.

He said: 'We are committed to continuing to lead this industry which is why we only advertise speeds that our customers can reasonably expect to actually receive.

'Ofcom's independent and comprehensive research consistently shows we deliver what we say, with our 30Mb service actually providing almost 31Mb on average.'

Broadband is 2 Mbps according to Ofcom, the minimum bandwidth needed for video applications such as BBC's iPlayer.

But the survey found nearly a fifth of people are receiving 2 Mbps or less.

BT is rolling out a £2.5bn upgrade of its copper network, which includes fibre optic cables being fed from telephone exchanges to street cabinets.

It hopes to reach two-thirds of the country by the end of 2014 and, with Government support, the entire country in five years, resulting in speeds of up to 76 Mbps.

Customers will be able to order an all-fibre line from BT from next year but it could be unaffordable for most, with prices estimated at up to £1,000.

BT Group chief executive Ian Livingston said the UK will be leading the way for Europe, adding: 'We'll be giving fibre to within 400m of the average home.

'If people really want and need faster speeds, we can provide it.'

Labour has called on the Government to update its broadband plans, with more fire connections to homes, businesses and schools.

Communications minster Ed Vaizey has boasted the UK will have the best broadband network in Europe by 2015.
