Anger: Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a blunt warning to the UK about the risks of arming Syrian rebels

Vladimir Putin today warned arming rebels in Syria would risk a repeat of the 'violent assassination' murder of British soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich.

The intervention by the Russian President to invoke Drummer Rigby's death came after he blocked the G8 from calling for the removal of Bashar Assad to end the bloody conflict in Syria.

The Russian leader refused to sign a communique at the summit in Northern Ireland which mentioned ousting the Syrian President amid claims that chemical weapons have been used against opposition forces.

At a G8 dinner last night David Cameron led seven world powers 
against one as he tried to shame Mr 
Putin into agreeing that Syria's brutal regime must be toppled.

Mr
Cameron was hoping for a show of unity over the civil war in Syria, 
which has largely overshadowed the economic priorities of the summit.

Over a dinner of crab and lamb at the G8
summit, the leaders of the US, Canada, Germany, Japan, France, and 
Italy joined the UK in urging President Putin to give ground.

But Mr Putin rejected the idea, and issued a stark warning at a press conference to mark the end of the two-day G8 conference.

In a direct challenge to Mr Cameron, 
he said: 'Recently the British people suffered a huge loss. It was a 
tragedy next to his barracks on the streets of London. A violent 
assassination, a very brutal killing of a British serviceman.

'Clearly the opposition is not 
composed all of this but many of them are exactly the same as the ones 
who perpetrated the killing in London.

'If we equip these people, if we arm 
them what is going to control and verify who is going to have these 
weapons, including in Europe as well.

'So we call all our partners, before making this dangerous step, think about it very carefully.'

Warning: The Russian President told allies to think 'carefully' before taking any decisions to provide weapons to the opposition forces

Division: Russian President Vladimir Putin has resisted demands from David Cameron and Barack Obama to back a call for Syrian President Assad to go

The decision to invoke the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich is likely to stir emotions in Britain

Other than Russia, members of the G8 
agreed on a five-point plan after two years of civil war in Syria. It 
included a condemnation of the use of chemical weapons and a declaration
that Syria needs a 'new government' with the consent of its people.

But Mr Putin has refused to sign up to a demand that Assad must go.

Instead
the leaders of the world's most powerful nations papered over their 
differences on Syria to agree a weaker joint position after fraught 
talks at the G8 summit.

The
chief communique states that the G8 nations are 'committed to achieving
a political solution to the crisis based on a vision for a united, 
inclusive and democratic Syria'.

It
endorses plans to restart peace talks in Geneva 'as soon as possible' 
and says that they should begin with both sides agreeing on 'a 
transitional governing body with full executive powers, formed by mutual
consent'.

Meeting: The two-day summit agreed action on trade,and tax but divisions over Syria dominated the agenda

Talks: British Prime Minister David Cameron warned Assad has 'blood on his hands' as G8 leaders threw their weight behind calls for a peace conference on Syria to be held in Geneva 'as soon as possible'

Protests: Oxfam volunteers dressed as Mr Cameron and Mr Putin pose for the cameras in a call for an end to global hunger

The G8 leaders also confirmed that they are making almost $1.5 billion available in additional funding for humanitarian operations in Syria and its neighbouring countries.

At a press confernce to mark the end of the summit, Mr Cameron said: 'It is unthinkable that president Assad can play any part in the future government of his country.

'He has blood on his hands, he's used chemical weapons.'

Mr Cameron said the priority now was to identify people from the regime and opposition 'who can sit down and talk about a transitional authority that will take power in Syria'.

'If that can happen that opens the way to a genuine transition to a genuine Syria free from Assad, free from terror. That is what we have agreed to work towards and I think that is an important step forward.'

Tense: U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland

A cold encounter: Mr Putin and Mr Cameron clashed during talks in Downing Street on Sunday

The agreement It comes after Mr Putin
ignored diplomatic protocol to publicly lambast first Mr Cameron and 
later US President Barack Obama for demanding action to end the war.

On
Sunday the Russian leader used a press conference in Downing Street to 
warn Mr Cameron that arming Syria's rebels will put guns in the hands of
extremists who 'eat the organs' of their enemies.

And last night during a G8 press conference a visibly uncomfortable Mr Putin admitted 
after talks with Mr Obama that 'our positions do not fully coincide'.

The White House has indicated it is now ready President Barack Obama, who visited a school in Enniskillen with Mr Cameron today, is ready to arm the opposition in Syria.

Instead a joint stance which has been agreed will be formally published this afternoon.

It will revive hopes that a peace conference can be convened to pave the way for a political transition in the war-torn Middle Eastern state.

Mr Cameron put Syria top of the agenda at last night's summit dinner with the aim of restoring momentum towards the proposed meeting in Geneva.

There had been suggestions that the other seven G8 countries could go ahead with a statement with or without Russian agreement.

But Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov announced that a joint deal had been agreed.

He signalled that it would not specify that Assad should step down from power and that no outcome should be declared in advance for how any transitional government wold be made up.
