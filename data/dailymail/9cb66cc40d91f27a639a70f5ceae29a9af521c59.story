Seen the opulent visions of paradise at the Chelsea Flower Show and fancy a piece of the action for your own garden? Well, never fear. You, too, can have epic statues, stellar lighting displays and giant gazebos — just as long as you have some spare cash to flash.

Here is a selection of the most lavish, and wacky, ornaments, gadgets and furniture items your garden is missing . . .

Up to £1,600,  enchantedtrees.co.uk

Plants deserve the best: This watering can is a work of art

Even your plants deserve the best. But this watering can — handmade in Vienna, Austria, from polished and patinated brass, with cane wrapped around its handle — is such a work of art that you may end up feeling it’s just too good for your yuccas and cacti.

Up to £20,000, bbqisland.net

Don’t show yourself up this summer with a disposable barbecue and cheap plastic table — go all out with a fully fitted alfresco kitchen. Make sure you include an induction hob, charcoal grill, glass-fronted fridge and under-granite lighting and spit-roasting facility.

Mix olde-worlde English charm with modern ostentation by investing in a focal point that will make all the neighbours gasp with envy — and will also protect your privacy while you have a soak in your spa. You can add colourful roof linings and side panels for extra protection, as well as bar ‘kits’ so friends and family who want to stay dry and have a drink next to the tub can still enjoy the fun.

Make a statement: This garden ornament has a tasty bonus

£2,000, kimfh.co.uk

Make a statement — and a tasty pot of honey — with a customised hive. Woodwright Kim Farley-Harper has produced several for Fortnum and Mason’s Chelsea show garden in the past.

Some have golden embellishments; others are given viewing windows, pedestals and copper-pitched roofs.

£3,740, thelapa- company.co.uk

Set up your own exotic-themed drinking establishment in your back yard with a 3.2m-wide tiki bar. Install a drinks station or use the thatched shelter to house an undercover barbecue.

£50 each, parrot.com

This nifty gizmo measures the moisture in your soil and communicates with your smartphone to tell it when when your plants need watering. The accompanying app can offer handy maintenance tips plus a library of ‘identity sheets’ for more than 7,000 plants. It also features graphs to analyse the health of the plant, weather forecasts and a watering diary.

£875, sparrowandfinch.co.uk

Launched at Chelsea last year, this all-in-one bird house and ornamental planter is painted a chic ‘French grey’ and features individually hand-cut and fixed cedar roof tiles and a solid copper ridge.

The birds won’t want to leave.

£400 each, chelsea-gardener.com

Nuts about garden ornaments: These decorations are best presented in large clusters

For
 a nutty lawn decoration, buy some of these cracking outdoor ornaments. Made from reconstituted limestone and finished by hand, they are
 said to weather especially beautifully when placed beneath a canopy of 
trees and are best presented in large clusters.

From £2,000,  malcolmtemple.co.uk

You don’t have to be from a Native American tribe to enjoy a totem pole — they are making their way into suburban gardens. That is in part thanks to artist and garden designer Malcolm Temple, whose 9ft wooden creations are the perfect alternative to a staid water feature.

£24,000, architectural-heritage.co.uk

This is the ultimate garden ornament — a bronze Mercury shown in flight and raised upon a circular marble plinth, made in about 1880. What’s not to like?
