Tim Sherwood is ahead in the race to become next Crystal Palace manager as bookmakers have suspended betting on him taking charge.

Eagles co-chairman Steve Parish has identified Sherwood - who was sacked as Tottenham boss at the end of last season - as a contender to take the reins at Selhurst Park.

Former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay is also a strong contender for the role, but Coral and William Hill have closed the book on Sherwood taking charge.

Decision maker: Eagles co-chairman Steve Parish (centre) wants to make an appointment soon

Out of work: Sherwood was sacked by Spurs at the end of last season after less than a year in charge

It is understood Sherwood, who is looking for a route back into the game after leaving White Hart Lane, is emerging as the leading candidate to replace Tony Pulis. 

He came close to becoming Pepe Mel's successor at West Brom earlier this summer, but a move to The Hawthorns collapsed over personal terms.

And the former Blackburn midfielder could now be set for a return to football with Palace.

Mackay has been out of work since his acrimonious exit from Cardiff in December and he now wants a return to the game. 

He has close links with Palace sporting director Iain Moody, having worked with him at Cardiff.

Chris Hughton, who was sacked by Norwich towards the end of last season, is understood to be an outsider for the role.

Parish knows he must appoint a new manager sooner rather later with the transfer deadline just two weeks away.

The club still intend to strengthen their squad before September 1, but know they need a manager in situ before pressing ahead with deals.

Pulis walked away from Palace on Thursday night following emergency talks with Parish about their differences over the club's transfer strategy. 

Gone: Tony Pulis decided to leave Selhurst Park despite a successful spell in charge last season

Option: Former Cardiff boss Malky Mackay has links with Palace sporting director Iain Moody

Outsider: Ex-Norwich boss Chris Hughton is unlikely to be given a chance to take charge at Palace
