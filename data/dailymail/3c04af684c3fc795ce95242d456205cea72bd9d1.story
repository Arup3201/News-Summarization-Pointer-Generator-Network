A collision of black holes - or neutron stars - could have been responsible for a blast of radiation that struck the Earth in the Middle Ages.

But our medieval ancestors - and the planet - had a lucky escape.

A new study by a team of German scientists suggests that the blast of radiation that hit the Earth between the years 774 and 775 was caused by the collision of two 'compact stellar remnants' such as black holes, neutron stars or white dwarfs.

The collision of two black holes between 3,000 and 12,000 light years away from us would have caused a very short but very intense blast of energy, say researchers in Germany

When this happens, say astronomers Valeri Hambaryan and Ralph Neuhauser of the Astrophysics Institute of the University of Jena in Germany, an intense blast of energy is released in the form of gamma rays, which are the most energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes visible light.

These huge bursts of energy are, however, very short: they last less than two seconds.

And, suggest the scientists, this massive collision of heavenly bodies happened a very long way away from Earth - between 3,000 and 12,000 light years away from our Sun.

That means that by the time the radiation arrived at our home planet, it would have been absorbed by our atmosphere, and there would be no obvious signs of the massive event that had happened far away in the universe.

If the gamma ray burst had been much closer to the Earth, it would have caused significant harm to the biosphere,' said Dr Neuhauser.

That explains why there are no records of any unusual sightings in the sky from that period. Other big celestial events were recorded: the appearance of Halley's comet in our skies in 1066 was recorded for posterity in the Bayeux Tapestry.

Researchers had suggested that an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that describes a 'red crucifix' that was seen after sunset might have been a supernova.

A black hole is a region where gravity is so powerful that nothing can escape - not even light.

But a black hole is far from empty - it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York.

These giant black holes can collide: Once they come so close that they cannot escape each other's gravity, they will merge to become one bigger black hole.

Even when simulating this event on powerful computers, we cannot fully understand it.

However, we do know that a black hole merger would produce tremendous energy and send massive ripples through the space-time fabric of the universe.

However, that dates from 776 - too late to have been a visible result of the collision between the black holes thousands of light years away.

But although our medieval ancestors weren't aware of the vast celestial event, it did leave its mark on our planet.

Last year researchers in Japan found that some ancient cedar trees had an unusual level of carbon-14, a radioactive material that can be used to date artefacts of up to 50,000 years old.

And in Antarctica there was a spike in levels of a form of beryllium, a rare element.

Both of these unusual concentrations were found to date from between 774 and 775 - precisely the period in which the intense blast of energy would have hit the Earth.

Fortunately, such events are very rare. Dr Neuhauser says that we are unlikely to experience such an event any time soon.

Carbon-14 dating techniques suggest that only one occurence of a huge blast of radiation hitting the Earth has occured in the past 3,000 years - the one our eighth-century ancestors lived through.

But our modern lifestyles mean we are much more vulnerable to such an event. Says Dr Neuhauser: 'Even thousands of light years away, a similar event could cause havoc with the sensitive electronic systems that advanced societies have come to depend on.'
