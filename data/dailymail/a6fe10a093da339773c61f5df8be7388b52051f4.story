Filipino boxing legend Manny Pacquiao has reiterated his desire to play in his country's premier professional basketball league, the PBA (Philippine Basketball Association).

Pacquiao was selected by Kia Sorentos in last month's Rookie Draft and also coaches  the side.

And the 35-year-old, who  became the shortest and oldest rookie in the PBA, is determined to make his debut soon.

The 35-year-old also coaches the side, but will focus on his boxing until after his fight with Chris Algieri

'I already talked to (boxing trainer) Freddie Roach that I am going to play in the PBA, maybe just two to three minutes,' Pacquiao said.

The boxer has not been present for the team's pre-season games, however, as he has been busy promoting his November 23 showdown against the American  Chris Algieri.

Pacquiao made it clear that despite his basketball aspirations, his focus will be on his fight against Algieri, where he will defend his WBO welterweight title.

'My focus is on my training for the November fight,' he said.

The Filipino also dismissed recent taunts on social media by Floyd Mayweather, who wrote on Instagram that 'Miss Pac Man (Pacquiao) is broke and desperate for a pay day' in reference to suggestions that the pair may fight each other. 

Pacquiao responded: 'I'm not affected by it. I pity him and I pray that someday he would change his ways.

'He (Mayweather) should fear God. For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?'

As Pacquiao prepares for the Algieri fight, he will leave most of his basketball duties to the Kia assistant coaches.

The new PBA season starts on October 19, with Kia Sorentos up against Blackwater in their first game.

The welterweight champion dismissed jibes from Floyd Mayweather that he is desperate for a payday
