Will.i.am led the charge of celebrities supporting then-senator Barack Obama on his run for the White House in 2008.

Seven years later, it appears the Black Eyed Peas singer is reconsidering whether his efforts were worth it.

In an interview with Larry King, previewed in a clip shared with Buzzfeed, will.i.am said he is 'disappointed' with the current administration and the sentiment is reflected in his despondent facial expressions.

Not happy: Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am said he was disappointed in President Barack Obama, in a preview of his interview with Larry King 

How do you feel? When Larry King (left) asked the singer (right) to assess Mr Obama's time in the White House, he said: 'It would have been hard for anyone'

More to be revealed: Larry King's full interview with will.i.am will air December 11 at 5pm on Ora.Tv

During the interview, which will air in full on December 11, Larry King points out all the work the musician did on both of Mr Obama's campaigns and then asks him to assess his presidency.

Will.i.am pauses several seconds before saying: 'It would have been hard for anyone'. 

When asked directly if he is disappointed, will.i.am at first struggles to answer the question but eventually settles and admits that he is let down by Mr Obama. 

Like many presidents before him, Barack Obama is facing exceptionally low approval ratings as he enters his final year in the White House. 

He even admitted that Americans are 'ready to trade him in' for a candidate with a 'new car smell' in an interview with ABC News last month. 

But will.i.am's disenchantment shows that Mr Obama is losing the support of even his biggest fans. 

Will.i.am produced several songs in support of Mr Obama when he was running for the White House in 2008. The two pictured above following an event at Ohio State University in  October  2012

Will.i.am's video for the song 'Yes We Can' featured several celebrities and went on to be viewed more than four million times on YouTube. Pictured above with the president in the Oval Office in February 2010 

Will.i.am was one of Mr Obama's secret weapons in capturing the youth vote for his 2008 campaign, volunteering to produce an album in support of the candidate called Change is Now: Renewing America's Promise. 

The first single off the album, Yes We Can, featured Mr Obama's speech following the New Hampshire presidential primary election and appearances by a slew of celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, John Legend and Nick Cannon.

The song went on to garner over four million views on YouTube and win a daytime Emmy award. Another single featured another array of celebrities changing 'O-BA-MA'.

Will.i.am is best known as a founding member of the hip-hop group Black Eyed Peas, but lately he has been focusing on his own music, releasing a new song last July. 

He is also set to be a coach when The Voice singing competition show starts in Australia this year.
