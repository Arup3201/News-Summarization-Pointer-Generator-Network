A blind pensioner determined not to be a burden on his family jumped into a harbour and drowned shortly after learning he had cancer.

Coastguards and paramedics desperately tried to save Reg White, 97, a former sailor from Aberystwyth, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

He was spotted going into the harbour near the lifeboat slipway at around 3.30pm last Wednesday.

Mr White jumped into the harbour six days after leaving hospital, where he had stayed for six weeks after doctors discovered he had cancer.

One of Mr White's two sons, Brian, who runs an art shop in Pier Street, said: 'My dad was well-known and well-liked.

'He lived a full life and had his independence right to the end.

'He had been in hospital the last six weeks and was very agitated when he came out and I don't think he would have wanted to be a burden or lose his independence.'

Mr White, who was registered blind, had been a sailor in the Merchant Navy in the Second World War, and went on to work as a master painter and decorator.

Described by friends as 'very skilful and knowledgeable', he was an expert knot-tyer, who could make beautiful arts and crafts from rope, made ships in bottles, and also previously played the guitar in several local bands.

Until three months ago, Mr White was still cycling to the supermarket, despite losing his sight. 

The family said they wanted to pay tribute to those who tried to save Mr White.

'We would like to thank the rescue services for their efforts and the hospital staff during his recent stay,' said Brian White.

'I know my dad wouldn't have liked to impose on those who had to get him out of the water.'

He went on to work as a master painter and decorator, but always retained his love of the sea, being a member of the Lifeboat and Coastguard crews in Aberystwyth in the 1950s and '60s.

Though he had been registered blind 10
 years ago, Mr White could still make out shapes and cycled to Morrisons
 regularly up until three months ago.

Dai
 Jenkins, Treasurer of Aberystwyth RNLI, said Mr White was one of the 
last of his generation of 'Aberystwyth harbour rats' who loved messing 
about with boats down at the harbour.

'Reg would come down the harbour twice a day or walk up to the benches and sit and talk to people,' he said.

'He'd always been a keen sailor and taught me a lot when we used to go out in the boat together.

'His health and eyesight had been failing recently but he always had time for a chat and was well liked down at the harbour. I'll miss him greatly.'

Town councillor Mair Benjamin lives on the next street to Mr White and said he was 'well loved and would be truly missed in the community'.

A sailor with the Merchant Navy for 
many years, including the Second World War, Mr White was once adrift in 
the Indian Ocean for weeks after the crankshaft broke on his ship.

They eventually had to break radio silence and get tugged to South Africa for repairs.

Reg was married to Gwyneth, who died 
in 1978, and the couple had two sons Brian and Dafydd and grandchildren 
Michelle and Leiam.

Police have confirmed there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr White's death.
