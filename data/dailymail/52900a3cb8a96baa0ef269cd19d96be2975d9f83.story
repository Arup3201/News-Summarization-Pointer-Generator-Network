The dilapidated ivy-covered mansion which was used as a love nest by Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh is on the market for £7.5million.

Sir Laurence bought the four-bedroom property in Chelsea, west London, to share with his new lover in 1937, after splitting from their respective spouses  following their secret affair.

They moved into the home while working together on Fire Over England and christened the detached two-storey house, which they owned for 19 years, Durham Cottage.

failing to sell at auction yesterday

Ivy covered: The house has a garden covered in leaves and weeds but is being 
marketed by estate agents as a 'magical unmodernised house in the heart 
of Chelsea'

But despite its romantic history - and being located in one of the most prestigious parts of London -  the property failed to sell at auction on Tuesday night.

A petition on change.org set up by what has been called The Vivien Leigh Circle', which is calling for the property to be listed by English Heritage, said there had been a final bid of £6.9m.

The cottage, which is on the market with several estate agents, has a run-down garden which is covered in leaves and weeds, while the inside of the house also appears to be in a dilapidated state.

As well as its four bedrooms, a reception room, a garage and two bathrooms, the house is set in its own grounds behind a stucco wall and pillared gates.

The property, which includes this run-down reception room, was run by 
the couple's small staff of a cook-housekeeper, Vivien Leigh's personal 
maid and a daily cleaner

The former coachman’s cottage, which is described as agent Russell Simpson as a 'magical unmodernised house in the heart of Chelsea', was built in 1850 and bought by Sir Laurence for him and his lover to live in while they worked together for the first time on the 1937 film, Fire Over England.

It was run by their small staff of a 
cook-housekeeper, Vivien Leigh’s personal maid and a daily cleaner. But 
speaking in 1954, the actress complained about 'drawbacks' to 
the inner city cottage.

She said: 'It is in London and we’ve furnished it for our life here. It has a lot of drawbacks.

'Nobody visiting it would ever dream it could be inconvenient or that those ‘fascinating’ stairs winding around, with the landing forming a balcony in the drawing-room, could be a nuisance.

'Several years ago we built on the dining-room. Before that we used to eat in the entrance hall - you can imagine the drawbacks to that.'

Sir Laurence and Vivien Olivier began an affair at the height of their careers, while married to other people.

After initially concealing their 
relationship, they eventually split from their spouses and married in Santa Barbara, California, in 1940.

Born in Darjeeling, India and educated in Europe, the actress 
won two Academy Awards for her roles in Gone with the Wind, made in 1939, and A 
Streetcar Named Desire, made in 1951.

But she received almost as much attention for her personal life and relationship with Sir Laurence.

The pair had a tumultuous relationship and Sir Laurence had affairs with other actress in the 1950s, including Claire Bloom, with whom he co-starred in Richard III.

Olivier and Leigh divorced in December 1960 after which Sir Laurence married actress Joan Plowright. He died from renal failure at his home in Sussex in July 1989.

He became one of just a few actors to be given the honour of his ashes being interred in Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey.

Vivien Leigh - who was considered one of the most beautiful actresses of her day - began a relationship with the actor Jack Merivale after the divorce. She died in July 1967.
