A gay man has married a transgender woman in Cuba - in what has been hailed as a 'significant step forward' for gay rights in the communist Caribbean country.

Ignacio Estrada, 31, and Wendy Iriepa, 37, tied the knot in a simple civil ceremony on the same day as Fidel Castro's 85th birthday - in what they called a 'gift' to the former leader.

They then draped themselves in the rainbow flag of gay pride to ride through the streets of Havana.

Technically it was not a same-sex marriage, which is banned in Cuba, because Iriepa is legally a woman - having undergone the country's first state-funded sex change operation.

Born as Alexis, she had surgery in 2007 as part of a pilot programme that, from 2008, made gender-reassignment procedures part of the island's universal health care system.

But the wedding was aimed at advancing gay rights in the country, where, in the 1960s, homosexuals were placed in camps for being 'counterrevolutionary'.

That initiative, that took place in the years following his 1959 revolution, prompted an apology from Fidel Castro last year, who admitted it had been a 'mistake'.

The ceremony was attended by some of Cuba's best-known dissidents and U.S. diplomats.

The bride, wearing a strapless white wedding dress, made an exuberant arrival in a 1950s Ford convertible.

She arrived sitting up on the back seat, holding the gay pride flag high with both hands as she smiled with happiness.

Stepping down from the car, she said: 'I'm very happy and very nervous. This is really the happiest day of my life.'

Estrada, who has Aids, was decked out in a white suit and red tie.

He arrived separately in a white Mercedes, and said he was also happy and nervous, but that the day's importance extended beyond him and his bride.

He said: 'This is the first wedding between a transsexual woman and a gay man.

'We celebrate it at the top of our voices and affirm that this is a step forward for the gay community in Cuba.'

The couple, who met three

supporters, reporters and curious Cubans.

After
the ceremony, at a government marriage office in the Havana suburbs, 
they had their photographs taken in front of a two-tiered wedding cake.

They
then followed Cuban tradition by riding through the streets in a 
convertible, the horn blaring a few notes of wedding music.

It has not been revealed where they will honeymoon.

Prominent
dissident bloggers Yoani Sanchez and husband Reinaldo Escobar, who were
Maid of Honour and Best Man, participated in the wedding.

Laura Pollan and Berta Soler, leaders of the dissident group Ladies in White, also attended.

Sanchez tweeted from the ceremony: 'We are very happy with what has occurred today. A big step in a small Cuba.'

Cuba's most prominent gay rights activist Mariela Castro, Fidel Castro's niece and President Raul Castro's daughter, did not attend.

But as head of the National Sex Education Centre, where Iriepa worked until recently, she congratulated the couple and said: 'One of our accomplishments has made it possible for Wendy to get married.

'It seems she found the love of her life and we wish her many congratulations, because all of our work has been for this, the well-being and happiness of our sisters.'

Mariela Castro's group runs anti-homophobia campaigns and is lobbying for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Cuba.
