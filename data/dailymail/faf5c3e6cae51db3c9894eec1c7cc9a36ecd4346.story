A series of signalling problems has led to  rush-hour travel misery for rail commuters across the UK.

The early winter period has seen a string of morning disruptions, with travellers in the Midlands experiencing particularly bad delays.

Passengers on London Midland services have had to contend with long-running signalling problems in the Snow Hill area of Birmingham. 

And today, London Midland and Chiltern Railways trains were affected by a signalling problem between Hatton and Stratford-upon-Avon.

This caused disruption to services to and from Stratford-upon-Avon, with passengers being warned that disruption would continue throughout the day.

Chiltern Railways services were replaced by buses between Stratford-upon-Avon and Leamington Spa, while London Midland was also running buses between Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick Parkway.

Trains which operate between Stratford-upon-Avon and Stourbridge Junction via Dorridge were not running between Stratford-upon-Avon and Birmingham Moor Street

Another signalling problem, at Bowes Park in north London, led to 60-minute delays between Alexandra Palace and Hertford North during the rush-hour, while signalling problems near Barassie in Scotland meant no trains were able to run between Ayr and Glasgow Central.

Signal problems at Filton Abbey Wood  led to delays between Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway

Abellio Greater Anglia passengers were held up by poor rail conditions between Shenfield in Essex and Liverpoool Street station in London, while another problem with signals, at Filton Abbey Wood near Bristol, led to delays to trains between Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway.

Tube passengers were also affected by signal difficulties, with a signal problem at East Putney leading to severe delays on the District line between Parsons Green and Wimbledon.

Yet another signal fault, at King's Cross St Pancras, caused delays on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines.  

Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'We have warned repeatedly that under-investment in infrastructure and maintenance leaves Britain's railways on the constant brink of a series of breakdowns and failures, and that is exactly what has happened this morning on both the surface rail and the London Underground.

'Any turn in the weather tends to expose the weaknesses and today we re-issued the demand to both the Government and the London Mayor to reverse the cuts programmes. 

'Yesterday the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLouhglin, was talking big about our railways. Today the travelling public are confronted with the harsh realities of a network operating on the edge.'
