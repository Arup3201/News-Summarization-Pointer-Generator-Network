Details of a sex-change operation carried out in the 18th century have been uncovered, in what may be one of the earliest instances of gender-reassignment surgery.

A pamphlet called ‘The case of the boy who had been mistaken for a girl; with three anatomical views of the parts, before and after the operation and cure’ by surgeon Thomas Brand has been uncovered.

It describes  how the sex-change operation was carried out, the New Republic website reports.

The pamphlet, published in 1787, describes how the parents of a seven-year-old brought their to child to him with a 'complaint in the groin'.

A pamphlet documents 18th century surgeon Thomas Brand's sex change operation, which experts say could be one of the earliest examples of gender reassignment surgery

Upon examination, Mr Brand said he noticed an ‘irregularity’ in the patient’s ‘external parts’.

He said: At first it seemed to be the female organs with an imperforated hymen; but, on more close examination, it was discovered that the part, which had the appearance of the labia pudenda, was in fact the scrotum, divided by its septum.’ 

Mr Brand said he ‘performed an operation to free the penis from its confinement’ which involved' a longditudinal incision on each size of the penis, as close to the pubis as could be admitted with safety.'

The 'cure' went on 'favourably', he added.  

After operating on the young child, whose name is unknown, Mr Brand said the child was able ‘to urinate standing up, wear trousers, and enjoy the privileges of being a male.’

The pamphlet contains no mention of either the patient nor his parents being consulted. 

However he did not view the operation as a sex change, but as a way of returning the child to his ‘proper’ gender.

Denying that hermaphrodites exist, he said: ‘The term “hermaphrodite” is properly understood as an animal that has both the male and female organs equally and perfectly formed.

But there is not reason to believe that such a case ever had existence in the human subject.’

The pamphlet describes the case of a 'girl' brought to Mr Brand with a 'complaint in the groin. He later discovered the child ws actually male

He concluded that if the patient had been of the upper classes, the case would have been a lot more interesting.

The pamphlet is eight pages long, with three illustrations of the child’s anatomy, and may describe on of the earliest instances of sex-change surgery.

It was discovered by Carol Warren, a professor of sociology at the University of Kansas, who found it when she was researching the history of electricity in the college’s rare books library.

The story has now been published as a study the journal Sexualities.  

'I was looking through a bunch of materials that had been shoved together and this one appeared', she told New Republic journalist Alice Robb.

Elizabeth Reis, author of 'Bodies in Doubt: An American History of Intersex' and professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of Oregon told Ms Robb that she had not come across any earlier examples of gender reassignment surgery.

‘The first case I found (in America) was in the 1840s, and it was received quite critically by fellow physicians’

Mary Fissell, a professor of the History of Medicine at John Hopkins University added that Brand was ‘not a quack’.

While sex-changes were unusual, the operation fits in with the historical record for surgeries carried out at the time, Prof Fissell said.

She said: ‘Certainly this is unusual for the time period.

‘In the late eighteenth century, people were doing a little more adventuresome surgery.

‘That’s the kind of operative surgery they were doing at that point. It’s not invading a body cavity. It’s not opening up the abdomen or chest. People wouldn’t have survived that.’
