World Cup winner Toni Kroos says he joined Real Madrid to play under manager Carlo Ancelotti and has revealed how the Italian told him he would make the team better.

Former Bayern Munich midfielder Kroos joined the Spanish giants last summer for £24million after becoming a world champion with Germany at the World Cup in Brazil.

And Kroos has spoken about how a chat with former Chelsea boss Ancelotti convinced him to leave the club he had been at for eight years and move to a new league.

'Ancelotti's also one of the reasons I came here – I think it's normal to talk with the coach before taking that step,' Kroos told the official Uefa website.

'He gave me a positive impression and told me Madrid would be even stronger with me in their ranks. It was obviously a good conversation.

Kroos claims he has a very good relationship with the Italian and is grateful that Anceoltti put his faith in him, even to play in a position that he was unfamiliar with.

'He trusted me from the beginning in a position where I hadn't played that much, which was nonetheless in midfield. I enjoy playing in this position.

'Our relationship is good. We communicate a lot before each game. We discuss how I have to approach each game according to the opponent we're facing. I still don't know every team that well, which is normal. But he tries to fill in the gaps.'
