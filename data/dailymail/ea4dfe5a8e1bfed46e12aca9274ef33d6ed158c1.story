This is the moment a school boy diced with death by running over a deadly level crossing as the barriers came crashing down.

Another reckless couple were caught on 
camera pushing their baby’s buggy over the crossing despite the red 
warning lights clearly flashing in front of them.

The youngster, dressed in his school uniform, sprinted across the busy railway tracks despite the flashing warning lights and lowering barrier.

He made it across in front of the train but then appeared oblivious to the danger he had put himself in.

Madness: Schoolboy ignores warning lights and runs across a level crossing in Crawley, Sussex, on November 22, as the barrier comes down

The reckless pedestrians all ignored warning signs where four people have died in recent years at the crossing in Crawley, Sussex.

MP for Crawley Henry Smith said today that the level crossing has been a 'chronic problem' for many years.

He said: "Network Rail have regularly done awareness campaigns, but peoplestill feel the need to jump the gate.

'I have been down there with representatives from Network Rail talking to people about how to be safe and raising awareness.

'People have the 'it won't happen to me' attitude. It is true that 99 per cent of people will get away with it, but it only takes one who does not for there to be a serious accident with tragic consequences.

'Even if the train has slowed down for the nearby station and is only going at 10mph it will still kill a child and probably an adult too.

'That particular crossing has been a chronic problem for several years. There have been horrendous stories of near misses and tragic deaths on the crossing.

'It is not just Crawley that has this problem it is like this across the country.'

The British Transport Police (BTP) today warned that the consequences of the schoolboy and parent’s actions could have been 'horrific.'

A spokesman for the BTP asked pedestrians and motorists to 'exercise a little patience' at level crossings.

Brett 
Heath, 19, died instantly from multiple injuries after he was hit by a 
train on the crossing after a night out in August 2007.

A
mother-of-two Linda Powell, 55, from East Grinstead, Sussex, died 
instantly after she was hit by a train at the crossing on May 19, 2009.

Then on July 30, 2009, former bus driver Michael Heron, 51, died at the crossing after being hit by a train at 11.23pm.

And
a fourth person David Barber, 53, died after he was hit by a train on 
the level crossing just before 10am on January 15, 2010.

He said: 'The actions of these people are absolutely unbelievable.

'They were clearly willing to risk their lives to nip across the tracks either to get where they were going more quickly or just for the sake of causing mischief.

'This time they were lucky, but we have seen many incidents in which others have not been as fortunate.

'Barriers are in place at level crossings to keep motorists and pedestrians safe from harm and, when used correctly, that is exactly what they achieve.

'However, when barriers and signals are ignored, the consequences can be horrific. We ask all motorists and pedestrians to exercise a little patience.'

The shocking picture shows the boy running across the tracks where the railway line crosses Horsham Road close to Goffs Park in Crawley, Sussex, on November 22.

His school uniform suggests he is a pupil at the nearby Hazelwick School in Three Bridges, Crawley, Sussex.

Headteacher Ann Fearon today said: 'I hope this incident reminds all students - and members of the public - about the importance of road safety.

'We will continue to impress on our students the importance of all aspects of safety. But this isn’t just an issue for the school, it’s an issue for society.'

Several people have died at the Horsham Road level crossing in Crawley in recent years.

Brett Heath, 19, died instantly from multiple injuries after he was hit by a train on the crossing after a night out in August 2007.

A mother-of-two Linda Powell, 55, from East Grinstead, Sussex, died instantly after she was hit by a train at the crossing on May 19, 2009.

Then on July 30, 2009, former bus driver Michael Heron, 51, died at the crossing after being hit by a train at 11.23pm.

And a fourth person David Barber, 53, died after he was hit by a train on the level crossing just before 10am on January 15, 2010.

Earlier this year Network Rail was fined £1million for breaches at a level crossing where two teenage girls were killed.

Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks through unlocked pedestrian gates at Elsenham station in Essex.

Judge Turner ruled Network Rail had a 'solemn responsibility' for the safety of members of the public, adding: 'Network Rail, in part by itself and in part through its predecessor Railtrack, failed to ensure that the risks were properly assessed, controlled or managed.'

Elsewhere in Britain schoolgirl Katie Littlewood, 15, was struck at high speed while using the pedestrian crossing at Johnson’s Footpath in Bishop’s Stortford, Herts., on January 28, 2012.

Nicola Dooris, Network Rail community safety manager, said: 'Despite ongoing safety campaigns, hard-hitting television adverts and rail safety schemes in schools which highlight the dangers, it is disappointing that people of all ages continue to misuse the level crossings in Crawley.

'We appreciate it can be frustrating to wait for trains to pass through but there is no excuse for level-crossing misuse.

'To avoid loss of life, injury, damage to vehicles and causing delays to passengers, always obey the warning sequence and never attempt to cross the railway when it has started.'

The shocking pictures of people risking their lives by ignoring the warning signals at level crossing were taken as part of an investigation into dangerous behaviour at the crossing by a local paper.

Network Rail statistics show that the number of deaths on level crossings is decreasing from 10 in 2008/2009, eight in 2009/2010, six in 2010/2011 and four in 2011/2012.

But Network Rail said despite the decrease they are continually trying to educate people of all ages about the dangers of misusing level crossings.
