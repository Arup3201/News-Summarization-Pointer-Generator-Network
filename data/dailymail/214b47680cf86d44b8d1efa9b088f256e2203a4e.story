Conspiracy theorist and investigative journalist Michael Ruppert, 63, has reportedly committed suicide

On her Facebook page, Ms Baker wrote: 'This was not a ''fake'' suicide. It was very well planned by Mike who gave us few clues but elaborate instructions for how to proceed without him.

'It was my privilege to have known Mike for 14 years, to have worked with him, to have been mentored by him, and to have supported him in some of his darkest hours, including the more recent ones.... Thank you Mike for all of the truth you courageously exposed and for the legacy of truth-telling you left us. Goodbye my friend. Your memory will live in hour hearts forever.'

Mr Ruppert, 63, has recently moved to the Rocky Mountains, a friend said in a Facebook announcement about his death

Dozens of fans left tributes to Mr Ruppert on his Facebook profile page.

Attempts by MailOnline to confirm Mr Ruppert's suicide were unsuccessful.

42 West, the New York publicity department for his 2009 documentary Collapse hung up the phone when contacted while the Milwaukee production office could offer no information.

Attempts to contact author Carolyn Baker were so far unsuccessful.

Phone numbers connected to Mr Ruppert's businesses were disconnected.

Max Mogren, who worked with Mr Ruppert for 15 months between 2011 and 2012, could not confirm his death today but said that a lot of his former colleagues' close friends had posted messages of condolence online.

Mr Mogren told MailOnline today that Mr Ruppert was very passionate and very committed to his work.

Mr Mogren said: 'He believed what he believed. All of his work was motivated by his love of humanity.'

After leaving the LAPD, Mr Ruppert started a  website From The Wilderness which claimed to expose government corruption. It included his claims that he had seen drug-dealing at the CIA.

Mr Ruppert gained notoriety by confronting  then-CIA Director John Deutch during a meeting in 1995 and telling him that he had seen CIA officers involved in drug-dealing.

He later claimed on his website that the CIA and American government was involved in 9/11.

In 2004, he published Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil.

The book alleged than former VP Dick Cheney had conspired with Wall Street and other government officials over the September 11 World Trade Center attacks.

In 2009, he starred in a documentary called Collapse where he spoke about his theories involving the demise of mankind following the economic and energy crises. 

His work was not without detractors. Many claimed that the investigator only used partial sources to qualify his work. Activist and writer Norman Solomon wrote: 'Some of the problem is in how he characterizes news reports. These 
citations can be narrowly factual yet presented in a misleading way. 
Yes, such-and-such newspaper reported that thus-and-so claim was made by
 so-and-so. The paper reported on the claim, but that doesn't mean the 
claim is true.'

Mr Ruppert had recently moved to the Rocky Mountains.

He is survived by his partner Jesse Re.
