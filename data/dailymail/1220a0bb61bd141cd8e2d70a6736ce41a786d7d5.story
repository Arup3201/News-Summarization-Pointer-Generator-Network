Pastor Maldonado has been confirmed as a Lotus driver for the 2015 Formula One season.

The current campaign has been a troubled one for Maldonado and Lotus so far, with the Venezuelan yet to score a point for the Enstone-based marque.

But given Lotus' seemingly difficult financial circumstances at times, the money Maldonado brings with him from state-owned oil giant PDVSA helps considerably.

Staying put: Pastor Maldonado will remain at Lotus next season

On track: The Venezuelan is currently at Hockenheim for the German Grand Prix

It means owner Gerard Lopez has wasted little time in confirming one half of his driver line-up for next season.

Speaking to his team's website, Lopez said: 'I don't want to give too much away, but as it's halfway through the season I can confirm 50 per cent of our driver line-up for 2015 as Pastor is with us for next year.

'Despite the difficulties we've had so far this season, he recognises our true potential as a team and we recognise his true potential as a driver.

'We will achieve great things together.'

As for Romain Grosjean, who Lopez has previously claimed has the talent to drive for a bigger team, the Frenchman's future remains uncertain.
