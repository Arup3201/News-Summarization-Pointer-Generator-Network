Siem de Jong stepped up his recovery from a knee injury with a 45-minute run out for Newcastle United's reserves in their behind-closed-doors friendly win against Carlisle on Tuesday.

The Dutchman has been restricted to just three appearances for the Magpies since his £6million summer switch from Ajax after getting crocked at the beginning of September.

However, the 25-year-old is closing in on a return to the first-team fold after coming through the game unscathed.
