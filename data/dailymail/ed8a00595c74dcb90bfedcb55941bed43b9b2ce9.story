The fourth teenager fighting for survival after being shot in the head in the Marysville school shooting has died, bringing the final death toll to five with just one survivor.

Andrew Fryberg, 15, has clung to life for 15 days since his brother-like cousin Jaylen Fryberg fired a bullet into the back of his head at point-blank range.

His girlfriend Zoe Galasso, 14, died at the scene in Marysville-Pilchuck High School's cafeteria, where 15-year-old Jaylen also turned the gun on himself on October 24. 

The four remaining victims were rushed to hospitals nearby in Everett, Washington, but only one - Andrew and Jaylen's 14-year-old cousin Nate Hatch - was upgraded from a critical condition to serious.

Gia Soriano, 14, was taken off life support two days later on October 26.

On October 31, Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, also succumbed to her injuries.

Tonight, the Fryberg family issued a statement from the ward at Harborview Medical Center to reveal that Andrew's wounds were too grave to overcome.

'We express our thanks for the amazing support from the community, as well as from everyone around the world that have been praying for us all through this tragic event,' the family said.

'We also want to say a special thank you to all the amazing staff that have cared for our son and brother here in the pediatric intensive care unit at Harborview.

'Our family is overwhelmed with the love and care that has been provided to our loved one during this time and you all will forever hold a special place in our hearts.

'But we also ask that you respect our privacy at this time of our deep loss.'

Andrew, Jaylen and Nate all grew up together in the Tulalip Tribe, one of the biggest and most successful Native American settlements in the United States, about 30 miles from Seattle, Washington. 

Nate, the only one shot in the jaw rather than the back of the head, was upgraded from critical to serious condition days after the shooting and is now recovering in Harborview Medical Center, where he has been able to walk and communicate with people.

It has emerged Jaylen lured the victims - his five closest friends - to the same table in the cafeteria at an early lunch break by texting them.

The group, who friends and family described as inseparable, had celebrated their homecoming dance together days before, and posed for smiling photos arm-in-arm.

Only survivor: Nate Hatch was the only one of the group to overcome his injuries to a serious, not critical, state

But tweets posted on Jaylen's Twitter feed in the run-up to his cold-blooded attack revealed a temper and underlying sense of frustration.

It is still not known what led him to open fire, but theories include the suggestion that he was infuriated by an allegedly racist comment made during a football match.

Jaylen, a popular player on the school's football team, got in a fight with teammate which resulted in his suspension.

It was days after he returned to play that he unleashed his attack.

Friends and relatives have refuted another theory that he was crushing on Andrew's girlfriend Zoe, although many maintain that could be a reason.
