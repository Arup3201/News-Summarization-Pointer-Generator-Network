What is it about islands?

Small inhabited lumps of rock are inevitably associated with strange goings on.

Think Dr Moreau and the Wicker Man, the Famous Five and, er, Pitcairn. Islands are home to mysteries, buried treasure and dark secrets. I have never been to an island I’ve disliked.

Jersey, the Anglo-Norman statelet in the Bay of Mont St Michel is no different. A few years ago there were hysterical stories about satanic cults – fantasies which evaporated under scrutiny.

A place of poise and majesty: Jersey's grand history is visible in structures such as Mount Orgueil Castle

Sniffy writers tiresomely refer to the island’s ‘sinister Nazi Past’. They rarely point out that with a ratio of about one German soldier per every two inhabitants during the WW2 occupation, resistance would have been worse than useless.

Since the war, Jersey has acquired another reputation, like Somerset’s Maugham’s Monaco, a ‘sunny place for shady people’. The decision, made in the 1960s, to turn the island into a tax haven, has certainly had a host of unintended consequences - and I think, on balance, that it was a mistake.

But the popular belief that Jersey is no more than a colony of perma-tanned, gin-swilling tax-dodgers is a misconception.

I have family on Jersey, and have been visiting since the 1960s.

This little place, which I love for all its eccentricities, is perhaps one of the most surreal anomalies in Europe. British yet not-British, a fiscal loophole incarnate.

Jersey has a land area of just 45 square miles – less than a quarter of the size of the New Forest. Despite this there are thirteen police forces.

The island’s roads labour under one of the highest concentrations of high-powered supercars and off-roaders anywhere in the world. Yet the island speed limit is 40mph, so few of the Ferraris ever get out of second gear, and 4x4s regularly get stuck in the narrow lanes.

Casting the net: Jersey is a glorious location for a family holiday

Everywhere here has a French name. Jersey Law, was until quite recently, codified in a dialect of Norman French - and French civil law, to this day, underpins much of the island’s legal codes.

Some of the older inhabitants still speak Jerriais, the old Norman-French dialect, and yet this is a patriotic British island (albeit one that is not in the UK).

There cannot be a more child-friendly destination in the British Isles.

The sheltered bays of the south and east offer safe paddling and swimming, and Jersey must have more rock pools than the entire south coast of England.

Older children will like the War Tunnels, a series of underground bunkers excavated by the Nazis (or rather their unfortunate Soviet POWs), there are two splendid castles (Mont Orgueil and Elizabeth Castle) and the bizarre and rather wonderful aMazein, an adventure park run by a farmer that is the diametric opposite to the Disney experience.

The hotels are pretty good too. There are some beauties right on the sea. One of the best is L’Horizon on St Brelade’s Bay, probably the finest all-round beach on the island (lots of sand at all tides, calm sea, safe, warm).

Then there is the food. Jersey may, in many ways, be more British than Britain itself - but the island’s cuisine is superb.

Back in the early 1970s, when the mainland laboured under the appalling tyranny of salad cream, frozen fish and tinned fruit, Jersey was awash with fresh seafood, extraordinary cream, sublime fruit and, of course, the finest potatoes on Earth – grown traditionally in seaweed-fertilised soil.

I remember, as a small boy, being introduced to things like fresh pasta and gourmet burgers – years before such things were known back home.

A special form of tranquility: Jersey is blessed with pristine beaches, such as Portelet Bay, on the south coast

Today it is almost impossible to eat badly on Jersey. Take your pick, but my favourites are El Tico, on the magnificent St Ouen’s Bay, an epic sweep of sand on the island’s West Coast. This informal place serves brilliant local fish and shellfish, and tender meats.

And it is on one of the best beaches in Europe.

Round the corner, on lovely St Brelade’s Bay, is the CrabShack – which does serve crab, is not a shack and is again, right on the beach. There are no fewer than four Michelin-starred places on the island (nine miles by five, remember). This is not a place to come on a diet.

At least you can swim it all off afterwards.

Jersey has long prided itself on its turquoise, unpolluted seas.

The beaches are, if anything, best in the west and north, but all have their fans. My favourite is Plemont on the island’s northwest tip, with caves, rockpools and ice-cream yellow sands at low tide.

The water never gets truly cold, and plenty of locals swim all year round. Yes, there is too much traffic, and yes, Jersey would do well to go back to earning its living from fishing, farming and tourism rather than managing other people’s money - but this is an exquisite place.

And autumn is a good time to come.

Jersey is about 100 miles south of the UK mainland, often just enough to push it into the warmth and dryness of France. When it comes to the weather and food - if not the politics - vive la difference.
