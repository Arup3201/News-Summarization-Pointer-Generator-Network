Digna Love, 34, was arrested and charged with child neglect and driving under the influence accompanied by a person under 18

A pregnant Florida woman dropping her five-year-old daughter at school was arrested and charged for driving under the influence after police found she was four times over the legal limit.

Digna Love, 34, was pulled over in a parking lot in Jupiter, Florida, at around 8.15am on November 5 by police responding to a report of reckless driving.

The police said that Love's eyes were glassy, her speech was slurred and her breath smelt of alcohol.

Love took a volunteer blood alcohol test and police said the samples showed levels of .363 and .360. Florida's legal driving limit is .08.

She was charged with child neglect and driving under the influence accompanied by a person under 18, according to CBS 12.

Love, who told officials she was six weeks pregnant, said that she had started drinking before leaving her house because she was 'unhappy.'

The incident comes just weeks after a video of a Florida man showing step-by-step instructions on how to avoid a DUI arrest went viral and outraged viewers. 

The video posted on New Year's Day, one of the most dangerous days for drunk driving, showed a Levy County, Florida man preparing to enter a DUI checkpoint by putting his license, insurance and a flyer in a plastic bag.

The flyer detailed the driver's rights and read: 'I remain silent, no searches, I want my lawyer'. 

As the man pulled up to the DUI checkpoint, an officer read the flyer and sent the driver on his way.
