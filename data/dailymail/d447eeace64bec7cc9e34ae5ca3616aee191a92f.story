Alive: Glen Folkard shows off his horrific scar after surviving a shark attack

A surfer has spoken of his terror as a ferocious bull shark sank its teeth into his leg.

Glen Folkard was thrown off his board and dragged beneath the surface as the 10ft animal caught him it its vice-like grip.

But as the bull shark  - a species known to be highly aggressive towards humans - released him for another bite, the 44-year-old seized his chance for life.

He managed to climb back onto his 
board and ride the waves back to Redhead Beach, north of Sydney - all 
while the menacing dark shadow stalked behind in the blood stream gushing from his horrific thigh wound.

‘It was everything you'd think it would be, just sheer terror.

‘He's
hit me from underneath, he's grabbed me, he's turned me, took me under 
and then let go cos I think he had fibreglass in his mouth... and that 
was my chance,’ he told AFP, five weeks after the savage attack.

The father-of-one collapsed in the sand with a ‘big mass of yuck’ where his thigh once was, but euphoric to be alive.

He added: ‘I just remember rolling off the surfboard onto my back, looking at the sky and just loving life instantly,’

‘I was laying on my back looking just
at the blue sky, going "I'm alive, I made it" because it was all but 
over. He was metres away from having a second go.’

Mr Folkard lost more than four pounds in weight of flesh from his leg and nearly bled to death.

He spent several days in intensive care fighting for his life after suffering horrific blood loss.

But he does not hold a grudge against the shark that bit him -- ‘he didn't know any better, it was a mistaken identity'.

One witness, who identified himself only as Peter, said the attack scene was like something out of the movie Jaws.

He said at the time: 'My son actually said he saw the shark leap out of the water and grab a fish before the attack.

'The man's skin was really grey. He obviously lost quite a lot of blood.

'It
was kind of like Jaws, you know, the scene at the start where 
everybody's pulled out of the water and it's a hot day and the water's 
inviting.'

Scores of people were in the water at the time and hundreds were on the beach and heard the frantic cries 'I'm in trouble, I'm 
in trouble', from Mr Folkard.

Surfer Steve Tidey described a terrifying scene of panic and blood.

He said: 'There was a disturbance in the water and I looked back and saw him get back on the board.

'There
were bits of his board floating in the water and blood was streaming 
out from behind him. I knew there had been a shark attack.'

Bull sharks are typically solitary hunters and cruise through shallow waters.

They are extremely territorial and attack animals that enter their territory.

Along with the tiger shark and great white shark,  they are one of the species most likely to attack humans.

One or several bull sharks may have been responsible for the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, which was the inspiration for Peter Benchley's novel Jaws.

The speculation of bull sharks possibly being responsible is based on some attacks occurring in brackish and freshwater, as well as there being certain similarities in bite marks between bull and great white sharks.

In India, bull sharks swim up the Ganges River and have attacked people.

He added that Mr Folkard started losing consciousness as soon as he was carried onto the shore.

As paramedics rushed to the scene, lifesavers gave Mr Folkard oxygen before he was carried to a nearby shed.

Mr
Tidey told how a brave Mr Folkard even managed to crack a joke about 
wanting to see his surfboard because it was his favourite after 
paramedics gave him some oxygen.

This was the first shark attack at a netted beach in New South Wales since February 2009 when a surfer lost his hand at Bondi.

It is not known, however, whether the net at Redhead Beach had been removed by maritime authorities.

The
New South Wales government's shark net programme includes more than 50 
beaches over a 200 mile part of the coast north and south of Sydney.

They are a series of short nets stretching from one end of a beach to the other and are in about 50ft of water.

The region's Green Party called
for the removal of all shark nets, because they are ineffective and 
pose a hazard to marine life.

The
Sidney Morning Herald quoted Greens MP Cate Faermann as saying shark 
nets were nothing more than a psychological comfort to swimmers.

'The nets are supposed to be a barrier to stop sharks reaching shallow water, but in reality almost half of shark entanglements occur on the beach side of the nets,' she said.

'Shark nets kill thousands of turtles, dolphins, rays and other species that are not a danger to humans at all.'

But New South Wales's Department of Primary Industries disputed the claims.

'Since (shark meshing) was first introduced in 1937 there has only been one fatality on a meshed beach,' a spokesman for the agency said.

The spokesman added that only about three dolphins and three turtles a year are caught in nets, while more than 60 per cent of rays captured are released alive.
