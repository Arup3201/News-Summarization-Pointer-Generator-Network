Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain admitted last season's 6-0 defeat to Chelsea was 'humiliating', but insists Arsenal are ready to take their revenge.

The match at Stamford Bridge, in which Kieran Gibbs was sent off for a handball committed by Oxlade-Chamberlain, was Arsene Wenger's 1000th game in charge of the Gunners.

This latest meeting is at a time when the Arsenal manager is celebrating another milestone - 18 years at the helm - and Oxlade-Chamberlain says Arsenal are desperate to avoid a repeat performance.

'Last season at Chelsea was humiliating,' he told The Sun. 'We should not have collapsed. It was an embarrassing feeling and I felt deflated afterwards. It was a feeling I never want again.

'It will happen to every footballer at one point but it was a horrible day. We must make sure it never happens again.

'Nothing positive came out of that game so now we can focus on how we are going to beat Chelsea. We have enough in our team to go there and cause them problems.' 

The 21-year-old will be hoping for a place in the starting XI after a string of impressive performances in both domestic and European competition.
