UKIP has unveiled a new ‘wag tax’ on designer goods as the party opened its conference in Doncaster today.

The party’s economic spokesman Patrick O’Flynn said it made ‘no sense’ to levy VAT on everyday goods at the same rate as luxury items unaffordable to all but the very richest.

He said there should be an extra 5 per cent tax on £200 shoes, £1,000 handbags and £50,000 cars.

Mr Farage has pledged to cut income tax from 40p to 35p for people earning up to £55,000 - but will increase VAT on luxury goods

Mr O’Flynn said the party would also look to scrap a loophole which allows foreign visitors from outside the EU to claim back VAT on shopping sprees in London and elsewhere.

He said the party was now ‘mainstream not extreme’, unveiling sweeping tax changes.

These include raising the personal income tax allowance to the level of the full-time minimum wage. This would mean no-one paying income tax until they earn over £13,500 a year.

The party would also cut the 40 per cent rate of income tax to 35 per cent for earnings between £42,000 and £55,000. Inheritance tax would also be scrapped altogether.

Mr O'Flynn told the conference: 'I want it to investigate the feasibility of imposing a luxury goods rate of VAT.

'It makes no sense to me that VAT is levied at the same rate on budget items purchased by the hard-pressed as it is on premium ones that are the preserve of the very well heeled.

‘And it seems to me that a luxury goods rate of 25 per cent could raise substantial extra funds from the wealthiest people.

'I would suggest such a rate be built around simple thresholds such as £200 for a pair of shoes, £1,000 for a bag or £50,000 for a new car.’

He also explained the party’s bid to scrap tax-free shopping for foreigners.

Mr O’Flynn said: 'The Treasury calls it "tax free shopping". It basically means that foreign nationals can claim back the VAT paid on purchases by filling out a form at the airport.

‘So foreign tycoons can get 20 per cent off their purchases in London, thanks to a Treasury waiver that is in turn bankrolled by ordinary British taxpayers.

'The Treasury is very coy about how much revenue is lost to VAT rebates to foreigners. But HMRC calculates that it is at least £300million a year and I have seen estimates which point to it being significantly higher. This perk should be scrapped.'

It comes after MailOnline revealed super rich Arabs were spending £4.5million a day in Britain - cementing London's position as the world's top playground for the rich.

In total last year £1.25billion was spent in the UK by families from the Middle East - amounting to some £25,000 for every holiday.

The party attacked the 'Westminster clowns' in the main political parties in Parliament, including Ken 'The Euro Clown' Clarke, the former Conservative Cabinet minister

UAE visitors meanwhile lavished £156 a day, according to the Office for National Statistics. They are the biggest spenders of all foreign visitors to Britain.

Only tourists under the title 'other middle east' spend more - at some £173 a day. Egyptians are the third biggest spenders, handing over £149 a day during their stay.

American tourists as a whole contribute more than Arabs to Britain's tourist industry - spending a total of £1.5billion last year.

But the number of visitors from the US far outstrips those from the Middle East - leaving the spending per person from the Arab world way ahead of that from the Americans.

Arabs now spend twice as much as Australians, Germans and French - and 50 per cent more than Americans.

Spending by overseas visitors last year soared by 12.7 per cent since 2012 to £21billion. More than half of this - some 53.6 per cent - was spent in London.

The amount spent by overseas visitors in the capital itself almost doubled between 2003 and 2013.
