Dancing With The Stars' Maksim Chmerkovskiy has strongly denied slapping U.S. soccer star Hope Solo across the face during rehearsals for the 2011 series.

In her new memoir, the outspoken goalkeeper and two time Olympic champion claims her dance partner slapped her 'hard' across the face out of frustration while trying to bend her into position.

She claims the Ukrainian was 'extremely apologetic,' following the incident and that ABC even offered her a new dance partner, which she declined.

She writes: 'He manhandled me in rehearsals from the start, pushing me, whacking my stomach, bending my arms roughly.

'I thought that was just how it went - how dancers worked with each other. But it kept getting worse.

'One day, Maks was trying to put me in a certain position and hit my stomach so hard with his open palm that I had a red handprint there for the rest of the day.'

Mr Chmerkovskiy said he was shocked when he heard the accusations, which he described as 'completely false'.

According to celebrity website TMZ.com
Mr Chmerkovskiy said he had no idea why Solo would publish such a false
and defamatory statement.

He said he has had dinner with Solo several times since the show and does not know why she would harbour ill will towards him.

At
time Hope's accusations were  reported, he tweeted: 'Always hated 
hypocrites and liars...but when someone is both AND an opportunist, I 
just feel bad for them. Can't win at someone's expense.'

In
her book - Going Solo: A Memoir of Hope - she said she did not want to 
end Mr Chermkovskiy's career and feared that if she changed partner the 
tabloid press would make her out to be a primadona.

The two-time Olympic champion said the slap incident was caught on camera, but the footage mysteriously disappeared.

She also claims Mr Chmerkovskiy  intentionally mocked judge Len Goodman after learning of a 'secret memo' that they would be eliminated that week.

And it appears that fellow Dancing With The Stars contestant Kirstie Alley, who was paired with Chmerkovskiy in season 12 and is set to dance again with him in the 'All Stars' edition, has come out in defence of her partner.

She tweeted: 'I shall bite thine tongue, lest I get into a girl fight that I would surely lose without a hammer in my hand...;)... ouch! bloody tongue.'

In a second tweet Alley went on to defend the show writing: 'Just wanted to say..DWTS is THE most REAL reality show on TV..what u see is what u get.. It's tough and sparkly and 100% The REAL DEAL!!'
