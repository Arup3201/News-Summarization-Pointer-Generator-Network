A Texas businesswoman who at one time dated embattled Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm has pleaded not guilty to three federal felony charges, in a campaign finance violation case that has linked her with the congressman.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn unsealed her January indictment against Diana Durand in April after she reportedly refused to help them build a stronger case against the congressman.

Durand appeared Monday in the same federal courtroom where Grimm proclaimed his innocence a week ago before returning to work on Capitol Hill.

Her indictment says she caused  $10,600 in donations to be made in the names of other Americans between November 2009 and October 2010, and then later reimbursed the donors.

She is also accused of lying in June 2012 when she told the FBI she didn't reimburse straw donors for their contributions to Grimm's campaign.

Diana Durand (C), ex-girlfriend and former fundraiser for Republican U.S. Representative Michael Grimm, Legal trouble: Diana Durand, pictured in February with her lawyer Stuart Kaplan outside Federal Court in Brooklyn, was indicted Friday on federal charges that she made campaign contributions that exceeded federal caps in 2010 by paying others to make the donations

Durand, described by her lawyer as 'not a sophisticated woman,' allegedly funneled her own money to Grimm's campaign through 'straw donors'

Durand's
 attorney Stuart Kaplan told reporters outside the courthouse that 'my client is not a sophisticated woman.'

'It's just an unfortunate scenario,' Kaplan added, according to the New York Daily News.

Durand and Grimm met in Texas before he ran
 for Congress.

Kaplan insisted Monday after a brief arraignment hearing that Durand had no idea she was doing anything illegal when she reimbursed 

He also said she would refuse to testify against Grimm even though federal prosecutors offered her a deal.

'If the congressman was not part of her relationship we probably would not be standing here today,' he said.

'When you take out 
their relationship, there's no evidence to connect either one with 
respect to complicity, violating the law by acting in concert or doing 
something as a criminal enterprise,' he said.

Durand, an executive with the oil and energy company RelaDyne, has said through her lawyer that she didn't intend to do anything wrong.

‘She was just trying to help this guy out who she was in a relationship with – nothing more, nothing less,’ Kaplan said in April. 

If convicted, Durand faces up to eight years in prison and a $600,000 fine.

New York Rep. Micheal Grimm faces his own indictment on federal charges related to the alleged concealment of more than $1 million in his former company's income from federal and state governments

Grimm faces his own felony charges in
 a case that began as an investigation into his campaign finances but 
quickly grew to encompass his business activities with a company called 
Healthalicious before he was elected to Congress.

On
 April 28 prosecutors unsealed a 20-count indictment claiming that 
Grimm, a second-term congressman, played a part in concealing more than 
$1 million in the company's sales and wages from tax authorities with 
both the federal government and the state of New York state.

Durand, an oil and gas executive, may have a hard time convincing a federal court that she was ignorant of campaign finance laws

He is free on $400,000 bond, and has insisted that he will beat the charges and run for a third term.

A
 House Ethics Committee had already announced in November 2013 that Grimm was under 
investigation for possible campaign finance violations but said it would
 defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice 
investigation.

Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, said following his client's indictment that he wasn't surprised by the charges.

'After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. Attorney's Office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,' he said in a statement.

He added, 'When the dust settles, he will be vindicated.'

In January a New York City reporter tried to question Grimm about the investigation, and the congressman infamously threatened to throw him off a balconyon Capitol Hill.

Grimm granted NY1 reporter Michael Scotto an exclusive interview after president Obama's State of the Union Address.

Rather than ask the Congressman about the President's speech, the reporter asked Grimm about his run-in with the law.

When the interview was over and Grimm thought he was no longer being taped, he told Scotto, 'Let me be clear to you, you ever do that to me again I’ll throw you off this f***ing balcony.'

Grimm first released a statement criticizing Scotto for what the Congressman felt were 'disrespectful and cheap shots.'

He ended up apologizing after it became clear that few others felt his behavior toward the reporter was appropriate.
