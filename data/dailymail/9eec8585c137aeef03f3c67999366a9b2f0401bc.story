An employee at a veterans' affairs hospital in Arizona has come forward - and claimed that veterans' records were intentionally falsified and their medical requests hidden.

Whistle-blower Pauline DeWenter, an appointment scheduler at the Phoenix VA, said in an exclusive interview with CNN she would note on records if veterans died before they could receive treatment.

However, she said someone had changed dead veterans' records seven times, if not more, to make it seem they were alive.

DeWenter told CNN's Drew Griffin 'by doing that, that placed (the veterans) back on the wait list' and let the hospital hide deaths.

'I would say (it was done to) hide the fact,' DeWenter said. 'Because it is marked a death. And that death needs to be reported. So if you change that to, "entered in error" or, my personal favorite, "no longer necessary," that makes the death go away. So the death would never be reported then.'

As part of the interview, DeWenter said she was told to hide new patient requests in a 'secret list' hidden inside a desk drawer.

DeWenter also said that because of a 1,700-person waiting list in 2013, she was forced to determine which patients could receive treatment - while at the same time was pressured by hospital staff to schedule appointments for other ill veterans.

'And that really overtook even the wait list,' DeWenter told CNN. 'Because now I have a consult where veterans are very sick. So I have to ease up on the wait list. It sounds so wrong to say, but I tried to work these scheduled appointments so at least I felt the sickest of the sick were being treated.'

DeWenter decided to take action after she called a veteran to take him off the wait list, but found out he had died while waiting, CNN reported. She later worked with Dr. Sam Foote and contacted the VA's Office of the Inspector General - and when nothing came of it, Foote spoke to the media.

DeWenter told CNN she 'submitted evidence' to authorities.
