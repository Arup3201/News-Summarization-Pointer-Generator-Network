It was supposed to be a dream come true - but Alex Salmond was pictured tonight looking like a man living through a nightmare.

In bombshell opening results, his hopes of Scottish independence looked likely to be left in ruins after voters across the country rejected independence.

The First Minister had been due to appear at his local Aberdeenshire count tonight - but pulled out to slip away to Aberdeen Airport instead, where he was expected to fly to Edinburgh.

The SNP leader was facing up to bad opening results, after Clackmannanshire - rated by Credit Suisse as the most likely to vote Yes - dramatically rejected independence by 54 per cent to 46 per cent.

After Orkney and the Shetland Islands also voted no, it emerged voters in Mr Salmond's own backyard in Aberdeenshire also look set to have rejected separation in his own backyard, just as the SNP conceded defeat in West Lothian.

The First Minister had been expected to visit the Aberdeenshire Council ballot count after spending the day in the county, where he has his Scottish Parliament seat.

However, after the release of a YouGov poll showing the No campaign eight points ahead, a spokesman for Mr Salmond said he would skip the event and instead fly to Edinburgh.

Mr Salmond grew up in Linlithgow, West Lothian, but his political home is in Aberdeenshire, where he lives in the village of Strichen with his wife Moira.

He is MSP for Aberdeenshire East, where he won 65 per cent of the vote in the 2011 election, a majority of 15,000 over his nearest rival.

SNP sources had indicated that he planned to visit the Aberdeenshire count, at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre, at some point tonight before flying to Edinburgh for a planned victory rally in the morning.

With final opinion polls indicating a strong No vote, Mr Salmond is no longer expected to appear tonight

An SNP spokesman said tonight that Salmond, pictured, would stay in Strichen and not Aberdeen 

The revelation came shortly after the release of the final YouGov survey, which put No on 54 per cent with Yes lagging on just 46 per cent.

Mr Salmond voted in Strichen this morning, then visited a number of other towns in Aberdeenshire before returning to the village in the evening. 

Sir Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat MP for Gordon, accused Mr Salmond of avoiding the vote count because he wanted a 'triumphant accolade' in his home territory.

'It's all about Alex Salmond,' Sir Malcolm said. 'Alex Salmond will not come anywhere he hasn't got a triumphant accolade

around him and something to crow about.

'He'll just crawl away quietly, as he's done in the past when things don't work out.'
