Cancer charities and MPs today condemned the government for shelving plans to firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets.

Ministers were accused of putting jobs in the tobacco industry ahead of saving lives.

One Tory MP said it was a 'day of shame' for the government which meant 'more lives ruined for political expediency'.

Shelved: England will not follow Australia in introducing plain cigarette packaging

Delay: Laws passed in Australia mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking, but the UK government will not follow suit

Health campaigners had urged the government to follow Australia which this year became the only country to adopt plain 
packaging, all cigarette packs are drab green.

Research suggests 
non-smokers and young people find less appealing.

But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has decided not to introduce the same rules in England, claiming there is not enough evidence it would have a significant impact.

Questions were also raised about the role played by Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby, whose lobbying firm has worked for the tobacco industry.

The UK government has spent a year considering a ban, and health ministers were understood to be keen to go ahead.

But it was not included in the Queen's Speech in May, and now the idea has been kicked into the long grass.

A Whitehall source said: ‘Only 
Australia has done it so far and they only did it at the end of last 
year. So it is not clear yet whether or not it would actually have any 
effect. It is very hard to tell, which is why it is being shelved for 
now.’

Smoking causes over 
100,000 deaths a year in the UK. Last April, displaying cigarettes in 
supermarkets was banned, and this will be extended to all other shops 
from April 2015.

David Cameron supported plain packs at first, but the Government has cooled on the idea.

While health groups have called it a ‘golden opportunity’ to cut smoking-related disease, industry insiders say plain packs will lead to more counterfeit cigarettes and less tax revenue. Some Tory MPs condemned it as a ‘nanny state’ measure.

Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer
Research UK, heavily criticised the decision to shelve plain packaging,
warning concerns about the impact on the tobacco industry would cost 
lives.

Every year 200,000 children in the UK were 'lured' into starting smoking, he added.

'This
decision is bitterly disappointing and lives will be lost as a result. 
We can't stand by and watch as these lives are lost,' Dr Kumar said.

'The
Government has stalled in the face of strong evidence and instead 
reacted to myths perpetuated by the tobacco industry, an industry 
well-known for suppressing the truth about its lethal products.

Prime Minister David Cameron has abandoned a ban on multi-buy drink offers.

It means two-for-one or supermarket ‘meal deals’ with free wine will continue to be available.

There were fears 
a ban would affect responsible consumers rather than problem drinkers.

The Home Office is expected to shelve the idea next week along with plans for a minimum alcohol price per unit of 45p.

A Government source said the ideas were ‘dead and buried’.

Instead, selling alcohol below cost price, or the rate of duty plus VAT, will be banned – affecting only a handful of products.

'The Government had a choice: protect children from an addiction that kills 100,000 people in the UK every year or protect tobacco industry profits. We believe it has made the wrong choice. There’s strong public support for standard packs; we urge the Government to act now, without further delay.'

Dr Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP and former GP, condemned the decision as a 'tragic waste of an opportunity'.

She claimed there would be 'more lives ruined for political expediency'.

Writing
on Twitter, Dr Wollaston added: 'R.I.P public health. A day of shame 
for this government; the only winners big tobacco, big alcohol and big 
undertakers.'

Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the 
British Lung Foundation, said: 'It is bewildering that the UK government
is still allowing the tobacco industry to target young people by 
refusing to introduce standardised packaging.

'The time has surely now come for the
government to stop dithering on this issue. Using expensively-designed 
packaging to sell cigarettes to young people is wrong and should be 
stopped.'

However Tory 
MP Mark Field welcomed the decision to postpone plans for plain 
packaging for cigarettes until it could be proved to cut take up of 
smoking among young people.

'There are two main concerns, one is that essentially
any decision really must be unequivocally evidence-based...and to 
contemplate letting these very significant measures the evidence base 
has to be absolutely rock solid and reliable and to date it’s not,' he told BBC Radio 4.

'There is this additional issue and one that can't be ignored, which is 
that there are substantial intellectual property rights that are being 
stripped away by removing brand rights, which are going to cost the 
Exchequer significant sums of money in compensation.

'I'm also very much 
of the view that we have got to be laser-like in our approach towards 
getting the economy out of recession, getting the deficit down and this 
sort of message and regulation such as this really runs counter to our 
view that we are entirely open to business.'

Not enough evidence: Whitehall said it was not clear whether plain packaging had any deterrent effect

In the Commons, Public Health Minister Anna Soubry insisted the Government’s position on plain packaging had not changed, but she refused to to be drawn on how long ministers would wait before deciding whether to press ahead.

'We have to wait to see the evidence as it emerges. I’m afraid it’s how long is a piece of string,' she said.

The Labour party questioned the involvement in the decision to drop plain packaging of Mr Crosby, whose PR and lobbying firm Crosby Textor was on a retainer for British American Tobacco when the industry was trying to block plain packet laws in Australia.

Diane Abbott, a shadow health minister, said: 'The Tories used to say there were in favour of this policy, that children should be protected.

'But now, not long after employing Lynton Corsby, a strategist linked to lobbying in the tobacco industry, David Cameron is backing down.

'People will rightly wonder if the Government is breaking its promise, despite the medical evidence and the wishes of British families, in order to please its friends in big business.

'David Cameron needs to explain why he’s doing it, when he decided, whether Lynton Crosby had any input into the decision, and whether he was aware of Lynton Crosby’s alleged business interests when he appointed him.'

Mr Cameron has repeatedly insisted that has 'never been lobbied by Lynton Crosby about anything'.

Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, who was instrumental in bringing about packaging reforms in Australia, claimed the Government was “putting business interests in front of public health.

He told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: 'I think the British Government are being very disingenuous in saying let’s see what happens in Australia.

'It’s going to probably take them a good many years to see whether or not there has been an accelerated downturn.'

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'This is an important decision and we make no apology for taking time to get it right.'
