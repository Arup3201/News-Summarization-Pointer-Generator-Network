Wolves provided Mark Warburton’s first taste of defeat as Brentford manager in a 3-0 victory at Griffin Park back in February — and an air of revenge lingered before kick-off on Saturday.

Though both clubs went on to secure promotion from League One in May, Brentford are a side transformed from the one who rolled over when these clubs last met.

Warburton’s men were ruthless this time round, with goals from Alan Judge, Stuart Dallas, Andre Gray and Jota.

They are now third in the table, just a point off Steve McClaren’s Derby side in first. Whisper it, but some fans are dreaming of higher ground.

Talk in the build-up to the game centred on the Championship newbies’ wildly contrasting form. Brentford had four wins from four, Wolves three defeats from three.

In fact, Brentford’s stock has risen to such an extent that discussions have begun, particularly inside the four pubs on the corners of their old-fashioned ground, about where the club could play Premier League football should Griffin Park not meet top-flight regulations.

It has been a monumental few weeks for London’s forgotten side.

At the Hurlingham Club on November 20, more than 600 guests, including England boss Roy Hodgson and FA chairman and long-suffering Brentford fan Greg Dyke, celebrated Brentford’s 125th anniversary.

In the club shop, meanwhile, fans can buy a beautifully crafted book to commemorate the milestone. More than 250 have been scanned through the till in the first week of sale.

Brentford are due to move to a new 20,000-seat stadium just a few miles away before the 2017-18 season, but a Premier League promotion before that date could see them sharing with another club.

Yet Warburton and the board are refusing to get ahead of themselves, despite Saturday’s emphatic win against a side who finished above them last season. The club’s chief executive Mark Devlin said: ‘Our primary aim is to stay at Griffin Park until our new stadium is complete, whatever division we are playing in.

‘Griffin Park falls short of meeting Premier League requirements in some areas. We are looking at creative and innovative solutions to meet those requirements.’

In his post-match press conference, Warburton added: ‘I think whether you go into a local Under 9 league or you go into the Premier League, it’s about doing the best you can in that competition. Our competition is the Championship.

Warburton's side are now just three points off Steve McClaren’s Derby side who lead the Championship 

‘We had a good run of five games, but now it’s December and we start the month with a new target. Our only focus is Huddersfield next Saturday.

‘We’re not going to say that we’re going to come in the top 10 or the top 12, all we are saying is that we will try and maintain our level of performance, and see where we end up in May.’

When asked about his team’s rise to third, he said: ‘It’s tremendous. You can’t say anything other than that. It’s a great place to be, we are one point off the top and I think we deserve to be there.’

Mirco Antenucci’s double inspired Leeds to a 2-0 win against the Championship’s top side Derby at Elland Road. 

United had failed to beat the Rams since September 2005 and a current run of 10 games without a win meant expectations were low as Steve McClaren’s side came to town. 

But the Italian Antenucci fired the hosts to three points in a fiery clash which saw referee Mick Russell show nine yellow cards. 

The club are thriving under the management of Warburton, and the ownership of Matthew Benham. With a new stadium on the way, a blossoming academy, and a team enjoying their best run of form since 1935, things are moving in the right direction.

Warburton reeled off the ages of Saturday’s starting XI. Only one of them is over 30, midfielder Jonathan Douglas. Seven of the 11 are 25 or under.

He said he will only add to his squad in January if he can find genuine quality. And who can blame him for that? They are doing just fine as it is.

Talk of a Premier League ground-share might turn out to be premature. But one thing is for sure, Brentford are going places — sooner rather than later.

WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE...

Darren Bent might have thought it was clever to cup his hand to his ear in front of Fulham fans after scoring on his Brighton debut. His old club had the last laugh, with goals from Hugo Rodallega and Lasse Vigen Christensen.

Nottingham Forest seemed to turn a corner with wins against Norwich and Wolves after an abject run, but they lost their composure at St Andrews. After Britt Assombalonga saw red having made it 1-1 at Birmingham, the hosts went on to win with a penalty.

Benik Afobe, on loan from Arsenal, impressed by scoring a hat-trick as MK Dons thumped Colchester 6-0.
