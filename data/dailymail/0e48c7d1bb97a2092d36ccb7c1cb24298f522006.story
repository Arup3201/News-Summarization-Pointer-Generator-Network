Stoke manager Mark Hughes believes Louis van Gaal is the 'strong figurehead' Manchester United need and insists the Red Devils can still win the title this season.

United are unbeaten since November 2 and have won seven of their last nine league matches ahead of their trip to the Britannia Stadium on New Year's Day.

That run has seen Van Gaal's side climb to third and Hughes, who played 467 times for United, believes the Dutchman is starting to make his mark at Old Trafford.

'Suddenly he seems to be the right figurehead for the club,' Hughes said. 'He's the guy you sense they need given last year was a time of transition for them.

'They're still going through that process to a certain extent so they need a strong person at the head of the club and he certainly gives that impression.'

No manager has used more players in the Barclays Premier League this season than Van Gaal, who has handed appearances to 26 of his first-team squad so far.

Despite United's excellent run of results, their performances have not always been convincing and Hughes believes Van Gaal is still working out his best team and style of play.

'It's still early days,' Hughes said. 'Van Gaal seems to talk about his philosophy a lot and any philosophy you have as a manager takes time to instil.

Van Gaal arrived at Old Trafford in the summer and is assisted by club legend Ryan Giggs

'He's changed personnel, given guys who were out in the cold another opportunity, changing shape and formations.

'That takes time, it takes time for the players to take information on board and perhaps he's clearing his mind for the way he wants to go long-term, only time will tell.'

United are 10 points behind league leaders Chelsea and seven back on Manchester City but Hughes feels his opponents on Thursday are still in contention to become champions in May.

'I think they are title contenders, they may have given themselves too much to do - they're 10 points back at the moment and there are very strong teams ahead of them,' Hughes said.

'They're coming into a run of form now which will encourage them and that's what they need to do, they can't afford to have too many more slip ups.

'Hopefully we'll be able to overcome them and that will be four defeats - historically you can't afford more than six to seven. If you have that many defeats it's almost impossible to win the Premier League.

'They'll be aware of that but they have the players to go on an extended run as they're doing at the moment.'

Consecutive wins over Everton and West Brom have pushed Stoke up to 11th in the table, six points behind sixth place.

Hughes is delighted with the Potters' progress and wants to add United to an impressive list of scalps this season that already includes Manchester City, Tottenham, Arsenal and Everton.

'2014 has been great for us - I think we've picked up more points in the calendar year than any other Stoke team in the Premier League,' Hughes said.

'But United are a good team, it's up to us to ask questions of them.

'Our record against the top teams has been good and they'll know they will be in for a tough game.

'It's a difficult place to come if you're a top team and we need to make sure that continues.'
