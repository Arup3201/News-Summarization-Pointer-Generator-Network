A schoolboy was taken out of class for a day - because teachers said his hair was too short. 

Jack Littlewood, 13, was punished with 'isolation' at his school in Wardley, Greater Manchester, because of his  short back and sides cut.

His furious mother Amanda Brown insists the youngster has thick hair and wears it short to stop it from becoming unruly.

But his short haircut was picked up on and the teenager was placed in a classroom for the day with children who had misbehaved at St Ambrose Barlow RC High School.

He was issued with two days of isolation as punishment and a note was sent home explaining why.

But the following day he was told to rejoin his classmates because his hair looked more acceptable.

His mother has now written to the school to complain.

The letter reads: 'It is disgusting he is not getting the education he is entitled to whilst in isolation and I will be taking this matter further should you inflict this punishment on him another day.'

She said: 'I can understand if he had a skinhead, tramlines or had it coloured but his haircut is just a normal short back and sides.'

School rules state boys should wear their hair no shorter than a number three cut all over. Jack has a number two clipper cut worn longer on top.

Year 9 pupil Jack, who had his haircut last Saturday, arrived at St Ambrose Barlow from St George's High School in September following the closure of the high school in Walkden. 

Ms Brown says he was never in trouble for his hairstyle at St George's.

Headteacher Marie Garside declined to comment on the matter other than to say: 'Parents are aware of the school rules before pupils start in September.' 

According to government guidelines, every school has a behaviour policy which sets out the conduct for pupils before and after school as well as during the school day.

Scools can punish pupils if they behave badly with measures including a routine 'telling-off', a letter home, detention or confiscating something considered inapporpriate for school.

But it can also include removing a pupil from a class or group.

Parents have the right to complain about a punishment and must first contact the headteacher. If they are not satisfied, they can ask for a copy of the school's complaints procedure.
