Team news

West Ham

Guy Demel is the only fresh injury concern for West Ham boss Sam Allardyce as the Hammers host QPR in the Barclays Premier League.

Demel pulled out of training with a knock on Wednesday and may not recover in time for Sunday's clash at Upton Park while Cheikhou Kouyate (groin), Joey O'Brien (knee), Mark Noble (calf) and Andy Carroll (ankle) are all still out.

James Tomkins was found guilty on Monday of assaulting a police officer in December but the defender is included in the squad and Matt Jarvis is close to returning from a thigh problem sustained in pre-season.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, Reid, Burke, Tomkins, Collins, Demel, Jenkinson, Song, Poyet, Amalfitano, Jarvis, Downing, Vaz Te, Cole, Zarate, Sakho, Valencia.

QPR

Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch will face late fitness tests in a bid to return after hamstring injuries for QPR's Premier League trip to West Ham on Sunday.

Brazilian midfielder Sandro has been cleared to return after suffering a heavy blow to the head in last weekend's 2-1 league defeat at Southampton.

Redknapp is expected to continue with a flat back four after starting the season favouring 3-5-2, which could leave loan recruit wing back Mauricio Isla again unlikely to start.

Provisional squad: Green, McCarthy, Murphy, Hill, Dunne, Ferdinand, Onuoha, Caulker, Yun, Traore, Isla, Henry, Barton, Mutch, Hoilett, Phillips, Austin, Zamora. 

Charlie Austin's goal against Southampton was one rare high points in QPR's season so far
