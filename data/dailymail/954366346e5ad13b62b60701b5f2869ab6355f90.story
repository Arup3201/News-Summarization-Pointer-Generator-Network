It took less than 24 hours for Stuart Lancaster’s cautious optimism about the fitness of his players to be dimmed after it emerged that Joe Launchbury will miss next year’s RBS 6 Nations following spinal surgery.

The 23-year-old lock, a pivotal member of the England squad when fit, must have his operation on Friday to correct the nerve problem in his neck which has caused discomfort for several months.

Launchbury missed the autumn internationals and had hoped a period of extended rest would cure the debilitating injury. But Wasps director of rugby Dai Young revealed on Sunday that this recovery was behind schedule, raising the spectre of surgery.

Those fears were confirmed on Thursday when Wasps announced the 20-cap star will have a ‘routine decompression’ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc which has caused him to lose power in his arm.

Young said: ‘As you would expect, this is a frustrating time for Joe, but the most important thing in all of this isn’t rugby, it’s Joe’s long-term health. We have consulted specialists in this field and they have recommended surgery as the best option to get him back to full fitness for the long term.

‘Joe is in good hands. He is being looked after by one of the world’s leading surgeons and he will have the full support of the Wasps and England medical teams during his rehabilitation period.’

Launchbury’s recovery is expected to take between three and four months, making it is possible he will not play again this season. The news came a day after Lancaster learned of Lions prop Alex Corbisiero’s imminent return to action for Northampton.

Launchbury has not played for Wasps since November due to his neck problem

Chris Robshaw: captain out for four weeks with ‘stinger’ shoulder injury.

Joe Launchbury: out for up to four months with neck surgery pending.

Brad Barritt: lengthy lay-off with calf injury.

Ed Slater: lucky if he plays this season (knee).

Tom Croft: horrendous run of injuries with setback after setback.

Tom Johnson: neck injury is keeping him sidelined.

Manu Tuilagi: groin injury proving hard to shake off.

Will Fraser: back injury causing Saracen problems.

Recently returned: Geoff Parling (concussion), Mako Vunipola (back, knee), Tom Youngs (shoulder), Dan Cole (neck surgery).

Back soon: Alex Corbisiero (shoulder surgery).

Launchbury’s injury — understood to be similar to the one suffered last season by England prop Dan Cole — raises more questions about the high number of neck injuries sustained by rugby’s top stars. Some believe those most proficient at ‘jackling’ for possession over the ball are especially vulnerable because their necks are exposed at the breakdown.

Another injury causing concern — concussion — looks to have also ruled Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton out of action until at least February. The Racing Metro star has not played since suffering a head injury playing for Ireland against Australia in November and French newspaper L’Equipe reported on Thursday that he has been suffering headaches and nausea ever since.

After consulting a neurologist, it has been decided Sexton — who was also knocked unconscious in last season’s final Six Nations clash against France and was sidelined for several weeks — should not play until February 14 at the earliest.

That makes the Lions No 10 certain to miss Ireland’s opening game against Italy but with such a notoriously difficult injury to asses, there are fears Sexton could be out for even longer. Racing coach Laurent Labit said: ‘As long as Jonny Sexton doesn’t feel 100 per cent, we cannot take any risks.’

It has been reported that Sexton will be able to take part in non-contact training, although strict return-to-play protocols say a player can only return to non-contact training 24 hours after becoming symptom free.

Sexton has struggled to settle at Racing following his move to Paris last summer and will return to Leinster at the end of this season, with New Zealand’s world-record points scorer Dan Carter confirmed yesterday as his replacement.

Carter — who will earn close to £800,000 a year — predicts the move will be an ‘awesome experience’, while Racing’s millionaire owner Jacky Lorenzetti denies the 33-year-old’s wages are excessive because of his enormous marketing potential. ‘Carter will be the best-paid player at Racing but also the least expensive because of the economic benefits,’ Lorenzetti said.

Meanwhile, European champions Toulon are considering suing the two Leicester Tigers supporters whose testimony led to Delon Armitage receiving a three-month ban on Wednesday.

Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal was incensed by the length of the ban, imposed after a three-man disciplinary panel found the former England full back guilty of verbally abusing fans following Toulon’s European Cup defeat at Welford Road 12 days ago.

‘We aren’t discounting the eventuality of going after these two supporters in court for false testimonies,’ said Boudjellal.

‘This is an extraordinary decision which rests only on the allegations of two opposition supporters, whose objectivity we can legitimately put in doubt.

‘There is no formal proof, no official document, not even television pictures, to attest to the veracity of these testimonies.’
