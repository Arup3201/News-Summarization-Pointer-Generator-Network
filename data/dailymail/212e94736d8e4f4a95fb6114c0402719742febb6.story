He's rude, crude and, unless you're of a certain age and spend a lot of time on the internet, you may not have heard of him.

But online sensation Dapper Laughs, whose real name is Daniel O'Reilly, from Clapham, south London, is about to become prime time.

The self-styled 'pulling magnet', one of a new generation of entertainers building a career on YouTube, has bagged a new show on ITV2.

Already he has more than a million Facebook fans, 300,000 Twitter followers, a top ten track on iTunes, and half a million followers on Vine.

But his new sketch show On The Pull, a co-production from Hungry Bear Media and Big Minded for ITV2, is set to bring him to the mainstream.

Dappy's tongue-in-cheek persona online is of a brash joker with a 'mockney' accent and nerves of steel who gives men advice on how to 'pull'.

In one sketch he says while videoing himself on cameraphone: 'A lot of people've been sayin' I'm some sort of Danny Dyer wannabe. I ain't.'

The camera then pans over to the Eastenders actor and film hardman standing in the background.

'F*** off out of it will 'ya,' the actor says.

In one sketch Dappy Laughs says: 'I'm here with my girlfriend, famous pop star Eliza Doolittle...' She protests saying he can be her 'friend'. He responds: 'Friends with benefits.'

Producers say Dappy's new show will feature him giving his dating prowess to members of the public as he helps others, and himself, get lucky.

The six-part series was commissioned by  ITV.

Dapper Laughs said: 'I can't wait to bring my brand of comedy to the ITV2 viewers, who says you can't sleep your way to the top.' 

Kate Maddigan, ITV's commissioning editor for comedy and entertainment, said: 'Dapper Laughs is brilliant new talent so I'm excited to bring him and his risqué brand of humour to ITV2.

'We plan to take what he's been doing so successfully on Vine and Facebook and supersize it, so I'm sure his original fans and many new ones will love to see his take on how to "pull"!' 

Hungry Bear Media's executive producer Dan Baldwin said: 'It’s fantastic to give a platform to exciting new talent. I actually believe he is the new Cilla Black.'

Chris Graves, executive producer of Big Minded said: 'Dapper’s a naughty little rascal with a bodacious approach to pulling!

'We’ve watched him explode online and are delighted to bring him to the ITV2 audience.'
