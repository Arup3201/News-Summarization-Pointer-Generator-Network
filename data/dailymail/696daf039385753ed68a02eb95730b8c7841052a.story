This eye-catching bridge design is bound to have the architectural critics tongue-tied.

Designed by Amsterdam-based NEXT architects, it this month won an international competition to design a pedestrian bridge across Meixi Lake in Changsha, China.

NEXT says the bridge, which is modelled after the Möbius strip and Chinese knots, will have a total span of more than 150 metres and will be 24 metres high. It will feature 'a diversity of routings' on different heights, providing several routes for walkers to take as they cross the river.

NEXT Architects, which has won an international competition to be the 
centrepiece of a new development around Meixi Lake in Changsha, China.  It will feature 'a diversity of routings' on different heights, providing several routes for walkers to take as they cross the river

The undulating construction is to be one of the key projects within the Dragon King Harbour River development project, part of a vast programme of development in the new lake district.

The bridge is the key project for the development of the public space of the river park's recreational, ecological and tourist program. Construction is scheduled for next year.

'The construction with the intersecting connections is based on the principal of the Möbius ring,' says NEXT's Michel Schreinemachers.

'On the other hand it refers to a Chinese knot that comes from an ancient decorative Chinese folk art,' adds colleague John van de Water.

Concept drawings for the 'Chinese knot' 
pedestrian bridge: The bridge is the key project for the development of 
the public space of the river park's recreational, ecological and 
tourist programme. It takes its inspiration from both the Möbius strip and the ancient art of decorative Chinese knotting

Chinese knotting is a decorative handicraft art that began as a form of Chinese folk art in the time of the Tang and Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD).

Chinese knots are usually lanyard type arrangements where 2 cords enter from the top of the knot and 2 cords leave from the bottom. The knots are usually double-layered and symmetrical.

A NEXT statement reads: 'The iconic appearance contributes to the developing identity of the area and with its lighting contributes to the whole light routing along the river.

'It provides both a view on the Dragon King Harbor River as well as Meixi Lake, Changsha and it surrounding mountains.'
