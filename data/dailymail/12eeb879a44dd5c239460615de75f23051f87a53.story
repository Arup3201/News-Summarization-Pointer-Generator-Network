Her mother is a former top model, her father is a legendary property developer from Sydney's moneyed Eastern Suburbs and her half-brother is a confidante of Australia's most famous billionaire family, the Packers.

Sophia Tilley, the young woman at the centre of the high-level corruption controversy gripping the country, has been portrayed just as the girlfriend of Stephen Wyllie, the son of top female crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen who is embroiled in the row.

But the glamorous 25-year-old has serious connections with Australia's wealthy and social elite, and a family pedigree which means the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into her May car crash is the talk of the town.

Ms Tilley is the daughter of 1970s model Georgia Riley and Sydney Eastern Suburbs property identity and developer, Barry Tilley.

Mr Tilley and his former second wife, who is now known as Georgia Fuller, accompanied their daughter when she attended court on Friday to face traffic infringements amid the legal wrangle which has engulfed her, Mr Wyllie and the NSW Deputy chief Crown prosecutor, Ms Cunneen.

Ms Tilley, who has a glamorous sister Olivia and several other siblings, is also the half-sister of Ben Tilley.

Ben Tilley, who was a school friend of Australian billionaire, James Packer, was also the gambling partner and confidante of James' late father, the legendary Kerry Packer.

Tilley, a freakishly talented poker player and multi-millionaire who lives in the elite Sydney suburb of Point Piper with his socialite wife, Tiffany, once travelled the world with Kerry Packer, staying on his luxury yacht on the French Riviera every Australian winter.

Ben is also an old school friend of Nine Network boss, David Gyngell. 

Sophia's two older half-brothers are financier Adam Tilley and businessman and former wine executive, Simon Tilley.

Lives interrupted: Despite being the children of a prominent Sydney property developer and Australia's star female crown prosecutor, Sophia Tilley (above, left) and her boyfriend, Stephen Wyllei (above, right) flew under the radar until ICAC decided to investigate a car crash in which Ms Tilley was driving a vehicle belonging to Mr Wyllie's mother, Margaret Cunenen

Sophia Tilley, who lives in an apartment in the multi-million dollar high rise Horizon building, works as the executive sales and marketing co-ordinator for Laing & Simmons real estate agency in  exclusive Double Bay, in Sydney's east.

Ms Tilley was relatively unknown outside Sydney's wealthy and connected affluent suburbs before the Independent Commission Against Corruption launched an inquiry into Margaret Cunneen two weeks ago.

The inquiry centres on a the aftermath of a car accident on May 31 this year when Ms Tilley was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo and was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore.

Big connections: When Sophia Tilley was growing up her half-brother, Ben Tilley, who went to school with Packer family connection, now Channel Nine boss, David Gyngell (above, left), was flying around the world, playing poker with Australia's richest man, Kerry Packer (above, right) and staying on his luxury yacht in the French Riviera

In the accident, the Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time and experienced chest pain, fearing that her breast implants may have been ruptured.

After Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt, she telephoned Mr Wyllie and he and his father, Greg Wyllie, attended the scene.

Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident and a blood test conducted afterwards on her at Royal North Shore Hospital showed no alcohol in her system.

However, two months after the accident ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30.

Ms Tilley is now the subject of an inquiry into Margaret Cunneen (pictured, right) the mother of her boyfriend, Stephen Wyllie

Stephen Wyllie and Sophie Tilley (pictured together) have unwittingly become the subjects of an inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption into a May 31 car crash involving Ms Tilley, who was not at fault, nor was she drink driving

In August, Ms Cunneen faced a private hearing over the allegations. ICAC made allegations that Ms Cunneen and Stephen Wyllie had coached Ms Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a blood alcohol test.

Ms Cunneen launched action in the NSW Supreme Court to halt the ICAC inquiry, which she has described as 'malicious' and inappropriately focussed on a personal matter in her private life.

Justice Clifton Hoeben ruled on Friday that the inquiry could go ahead.

On the same day, Ms Tilley faced the Downing Centre Local court over traffic infringements and had her driver's license suspended for two months.

The ICAC inquiry has been postponed as Ms Cunneen launches an appeal, which will be heard next Tuesday, November 18 in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal.
