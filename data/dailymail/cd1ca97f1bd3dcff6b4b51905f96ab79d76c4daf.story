Income tax and national insurance could be merged if the Tories win the general election, it was reported last night.

George Osborne was said to have considered the proposal as part of the recent Budget, and it was suggested he was now looking to put it in his party’s manifesto ahead of the general election.

However, the claims were immediately denied by Treasury sources last night.

Some senior Tories believe rolling together the opaque national insurance system with income tax would remind people of the scale of the tax contribution they make. Supporters of the reform believe that it would increase popular pressure to bring taxes down.

The Chancellor has long considered national insurance a ‘stealth tax’ because it can be raised without uproar.

However, the move would involve merging two computer systems, and could cause another Whitehall IT disaster – leading to problems similar to those that have beset universal credit.

A source told The Times: ‘We came within a whisker of doing this at the last budget, but in the end we decided against it.

‘They are currently on two separate computer systems and we thought the risk was just too great. But it’s something we could do in the next Parliament.’

But last night a Treasury source said there were no plans at all to merge the two types of tax, and discussions had not taken place about it being part of the Conservative manifesto for next year.
