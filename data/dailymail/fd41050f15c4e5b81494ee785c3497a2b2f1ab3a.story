Dutch legend Patrick Kluivert had plenty in his locker as a player - and it appears his youngest son, Shane, has  as well.

Earlier this month Kluivert Snr was watching Shane, 7, participate in a junior match and to his delight saw him score a stunning free-kick, fitting to win any game of football.

Kluivert put footage of the free-kick on his Instagram page with the proud dad adding: 'This mornings free-kick of @shanekluivert'  #LarenF2 #proud.

Shane has a moment to remember as he is pictured with his father Patrick and Barcelona star Lionel Messi

The 38-year-old can also be heard letting out a celebratory yelp as he savoured the moment.

And just as Shane probably thought things could not get much better for him, he then had the opportunity to meet Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi just days later.

Shane is not the only other one in the family to take after his father's skills though, with older brother Justin currently working his way up the ranks at one of his dad's former sides Ajax.
