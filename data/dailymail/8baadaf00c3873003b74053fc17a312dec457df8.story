In a society saturated with lotions and potions promising to turn back the clock, it comes as little surprise that women are paranoid about ageing.

In fact, so concerned are British women about the onset of wrinkles that a third view 45 as being 'over the hill' - and believe they look old at this age. 

Over half of women (52 per cent) cited 45 as the age when they would consider using Botox or other injectables and a further 28 per cent of women said they would consider having more drastic cosmetic surgery, such as face lifts.

Dreaded age: A new survey reveals that women are so concerned about the onset of wrinkles that a third view 45 as being over the hill - the same age as Renee Zellwegger, pictured, left, last week and, right, when she shot to fame as Bridget Jones ten years ago

Bridget Jones actress Renee Zellweger, who is 45, appeared at an event in Los Angeles looking drastically different to how she looked in the hit film. 

The star credits her healthy new lifestyle for her new appearance but the vast majority of women (86 per cent) surveyed are convinced that Renee now looks much older than her true age and believe she looked more beautiful in the 2001 film.

Most of the women cite Jennifer Aniston as someone who has aged gracefully and they think the A-list actress looks at least ten years younger than her age of 45.

Ageing gracefully: The survey also revealed that women rate Jennifer Aniston, left, who they think looks at least ten years younger than her age of 45, and also think Dame Helen Mirren, right, 69, looks great

A spokesperson for Escentual.com, who commissioned the research, said: 'It’s a common fear for the Bridget Jones generation to fear hitting their mid 40s, and at that point several women said they would take "drastic" measures to turn back the beauty clock.

'Many said they worried about being seen as old, and getting lines and wrinkles but the fact is that if you look after your skin from your late teens with good skincare products, then there really is no need to fear turning 45. 

'You only have to look at actresses like Jennifer Aniston to know that you can still look fabulous at that age if you take care of your skin.

'The worst thing to do is to get to 45 and then feel the need to take drastic measures, which can sometimes really backfire.'

Plastic and Cosmetic Surgeon Dr Alex Karidis from London’s Karidis Clinic told MailOnline he believes Renee may have had an upper eye lift as ‘the distance between the brow and her eye is much smaller than before.’

Alex also explained there is more of her eyelid showing and her eyes look much bigger, however her brows are not higher, which suggests she hasn’t had a brow lift. ‘Her forehead is smooth - you would expect more expressive wrinkles when she smiles which indicates a possible small dose of Botox between eyelid and eye,’ he said.

He also suggested she could have had 'non-surgical treatments such as ultrasound therapy to firm the skin and medical grade facial to get rid of dead skin cells.’
