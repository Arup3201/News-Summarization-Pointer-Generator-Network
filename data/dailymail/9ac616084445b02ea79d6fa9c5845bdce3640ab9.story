Eilish McColgan's Olympic dream is still alive, despite a run-in with a car while jogging in Portugal

British steeplechase medal hopeful Eilish McColgan had a lucky escape this morning when she was hit by a car while on a training run.

The 21-year-old Scot - whose mother Liz won silver at the Seoul Olympics - ended up on the bonnet of the car after she was clipped on the legs while jogging near the Team GB training camp in Portugal.

Amazingly Miss McColgan was unhurt and will be fit to start the 3000m steeplechase on Saturday morning - but the angry athlete slammed the female driver who almost ended her Olympic dreams.

The accident happened just hours before the athletes were due to travel to London.

The
Dundee-based runner shared her accident with followers on Twitter this 
morning, posting a message that read: 'Just got hit by a car on my run! 
Luckily didn't get hurt as she clipped the bottom of my legs and I 
landed on the bonnet - stupid lady driver!'

A concerned fan tweeted back: 'OMG, So glad you're ok. The world needs less and less stupid drivers.'

A
Team GB spokesman insists Miss McColgan was unhurt by the collision and
even managed to carry on running, once she'd climbed off the car bonnet
and shaken herself down.

Running dynasty: Eilish's mother Liz McColgan in her athletics heyday

In a statement they said: 'The British 
Olympic Association confirmed that Eilish McColgan has been involved 
with a collision with a slowing car whilst running in Portugal.

'She received a blow to her left side, but she was still able to run the two miles back to the team's holding camp in Monte Gordo.

'She is currently receiving treatment and has been declared fit to travel into the village later today.

'It is not foreseen that the incident will threaten her competing at the Games.'

But her worried mother Liz fears she won't feel the full effects of her scrape until tomorrow.

Calling her a 'lucky lady' the former world 10,000 metres champion Tweeted: 'Eilish got hit by a car this morning in her run, but thankfully she's ok.

'Just a stiff back, probably be a bit worse tomorrow. Lucky lady.'

Miss McColgan has had her fair share of misfortune en route to the Olympics.

The middle-distance runner qualified to take part in the Olympics after winning her trial event at Birmingham's Alexander Stadium despite suffering from a throat infection and headaches.

She has also fought back from a broken foot, which kept her on crutches at the start of the year.
