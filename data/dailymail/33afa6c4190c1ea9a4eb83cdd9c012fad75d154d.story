A 76-year-old French woman has been brutally raped and assaulted after telling a group of young men to quiet down outside her apartment.

The elderly woman was attacked by four masked men in her own home, located in a block of flats in a Parisian suburb.

The men broke into the flat, assaulted and raped her before looting the flat, French media reports.

The woman was attacked after telling off a group of youths that had been disturbing the peace outside her apartment in the Parisian suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine.

‘A group of unemployed young men would meet up there,’ a neighbour told Le Parisian.

‘They were often noisy and intoxicated.’

The neighbour said the situation had been deteriorating for some time, and that the woman had simply told the group to quiet down.

The group responded with ‘anti-white’ insults and threatened to retaliate, The Local reports.

Days later four masked men entered the flat after the unnamed victim’s partner had gone to work.

According to reports, three intruders ravaged the apartment, while a fourth brutally sexually assaulted the elderly woman.

‘It’s appalling,’ the neighbour adds. ;Since that day her shutters are closed.’

Police have been able to identify and arrest the alleged rapist last week, but are still looking for three more suspects.
