A number of Sheffield United fans have said they would welcome Ched Evans back to Bramall Lane  following his release from jail on Friday. 

Speaking to Sportsmail outside the Coral Windows Stadium before the Blades' 2-0 away victory over Bradford, the majority of the Sheffield United fans interviewed were in favour of Evans returning to the club. 

'The law states that every man should have the right to come back into his own job,' said one Blades fan. 'Whether I agree or disagree with it doesn't matter.' 

Sheffield United has denied reports that it has offered a contract to Evans since his release from prison 

Former Sheffield United striker Evans was released from prison on Friday after serving half of his five-year sentence for rape. 

The 25-year-old Welsh footballer was found guilty in April 2012 of raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel in May 2011. 

Sheffield United has denied reports it has offered a contract to the disgraced footballer.
