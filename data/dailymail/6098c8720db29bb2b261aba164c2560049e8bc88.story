Unfit: Christopher Scott Ryon, 27, has been charged with the aggravated manslaughter of his daughter

A man who allegedly beat his three-month-old daughter to death was charged today.

Christopher Scott Ryon, 27, has been accused of aggravated manslaughter of a child, police said.

He reportedly punched daughter Riley Ryon in the head because she wouldn't stop crying at their home in Winter Haven, Florida.

The baby was discovered face down and not breathing on the bedroom floor by her mother Kristine Bardell when she returned to the family's apartment complex on her lunch break at 1pm on Tuesday.

Ryon was asleep on the couch at the time.

According to the affidavit, Miss Bardell woke up her boyfriend and asked him to check on their daughter while she made lunch.

He went to the bedroom and returned to tell her that the baby was fine.

A short time later Miss Bardell discovered her unconscious child and frantically called 911.

Police arrived and performed CPR on the baby. Riley was taken to Winter Haven Hospital but later died.

The medical examiner ruled that the baby had a skull fracture caused by blunt force trauma with a 'great amount of force'.

When informed of his daughter's horrific injuries, Ryon initially told police that he may have dropped her on the bed from a height of three inches.

Throughout the interview, he referred to the baby girl as 'it', according to the report.

He later told detectives that he had 
punched his daughter in the head because she would not stop crying and 
the noise had stopped him from sleeping.

He described the noise as 'screams that go through me like bullets' to officers in Florida.

The unemployed 27-year-old said he did not believe that he had struck his baby hard  - but described it as a 'six or seven' on a scale of one to ten.

After hitting his daughter, Ryon said that she cried for another five minutes and then fell silent but that he checked on the victim and believed her to be fine.
