Job done! It wasn’t a classic performance but six tries and a 30-point winning margin is what I was hoping for and England just about delivered against an Italy team that ‘turned up’ and made life difficult at times. Certainly compared with their scrappy 18-11 win over Italy two seasons ago this was an improvement

Time now to move on very quickly because England will need to find another level of precision altogether if they are to beat Ireland in Dublin, which looks like being the pivotal game in this year’s Six Nations.

The good was there for all to see from England. Jonathan Joseph is on fire, has the confidence to try things from long range and was very good value for his two tries and rightly takes man-of-the-match honours.

Jonathan Joseph: The Bath man is in form, so much so that he took the reorganising of the England back line in his stride, whereas a year ago that might have fazed him. His first try for England was a big moment, settling the side’s nerves at a key time. OK, Italy’s tackling wasn’t fantastic but Joseph can be a hard man to lay a hand on when he is in this mood. His second try underlined his understanding with George Ford, who put him into space at speed. After that it was just a sprint for home. 

Anthony Watson built on his excellent performance in Cardiff and not only continues to look good in attack but made some very good tackles in the second half. These two are nailed on now in this developing England back line.

George Ford ticked over nicely but it was also well worthwhile giving Danny Cipriani some game time. He didn’t disappoint.

Big-match player that he is, Cipriani took less than a minute to ghost in for a try and looked almost apologetic after he touched down as if he didn’t want to gatecrash the party and upset anybody.

He shouldn’t worry on that score. Look at the tape. He worked hard for that try. He saw something was on down the left, found Jonny May early with the pass and then showed good pace and anticipation to track May along the touchline and take up the perfect position for the return pass. It was a deceptively difficult and classy try and he will feel much more part of things after that.

I suspect Nick Easter will also have enjoyed his rumble over for a try as well and he definitely made an impact when coming on.

There were some passages of play I didn’t enjoy quite so much, though. England are developing a bad habit of getting out of the blocks slowly and their approach was altogether too sloppy in the first five minutes.

They passed the ball along the line without any intent instead of hoofing down the pitch and they coughed up a turnover at their first line-out which put Italy on the attack and led eventually to the Italians’ early try.

Their rearrangement after Mike Brown’s injury confused me a little, although it did seem to settle down in the second half. The obvious thing to do was bring on Cipriani at full back or move Watson to full back and ask Cipriani or Billy Twelvetrees to play on the wing.

Instead, what seemed to happen is that Watson moved to full back, Twelvetrees went to 12, Burrell went to 13 and Joseph found himself on the wing. What England effectively ended up doing was making four changes when they could have rejigged after the injury with just one or two.
