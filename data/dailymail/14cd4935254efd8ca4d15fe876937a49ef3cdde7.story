The Miami Dolphins ran in five touchdowns to thrash the Oakland Raiders 38-14 in a one-sided NFL International Series contest in front of over 83,000 fans at Wembley on Sunday.

Miami quarterback Ryan Tannehill completed 23 of his 31 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns while running back Lamar Miller added two more in a crushing victory.

Cornerback Cortland Finnegan also went in for a touchdown as Miami ended their run of two straight defeats and recorded their first win since they beat New England in week one.

Oakland, meanwhile, remained winless in 2014 and sit bottom of the AFC West after four straight defeats.

Running back Maurice Jones-Drew was passed fit to play for Oakland after recovering from a hand injury sustained on the opening day of the season.

For Miami, quarterback Tannehill retained his place - despite a public spat with coach Joe Philbin earlier in the week - but running back Knowshon Moreno (elbow) and centre Mike Pouncey (hip) were both among the Dolphins inactives.

Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill began to find his range in the second quarter, as Miami picked up 21 unanswered points 

The Raiders offense came into the game ranked last in the league with just 37 points in their three matches so far this season. But, after receiving the ball from kick-off, Oakland marched all the way down the field to score a touchdown on their opening drive.

The very first play of the game saw Raiders quarterback Derek Carr hit wide receiver James Jones for a 30-yard gain. Oakland maintained that momentum and, on the 10th play of the 74-yard drive, Carr found tight end Brian Leonhardt in the end zone with a three-yard pass for a touchdown.

Miami’s offense responded immediately with a score of their own as Caleb Sturgis kicked a 41-yard field goal. Despite the absence of Moreno, the Dolphins rushing game came into this contest ranked No 7 in the league. Lamar Miller’s 21-yard run moved Miami into Oakland territory and Sturgis came out to kick the field goal after an eight-play, 47-yard drive.

Dolphins quarterback Tannehill also started to find his range, and he hit Mike Wallace with a 13-yard touchdown pass at the beginning of the second quarter as Miami took a 10-7 lead.

It was an impressive start from Tannehill after he came under fire from head coach Philbin following their 34-15 defeat by the Kansas City Chiefs last weekend. His pass to Wallace at the end of an eight-play, 91-yard drive was his ninth completion in his first 11 throws for 112 yards.

Oakland, meanwhile, were struggling to move the chains and Miami had the ball back very quickly after Carr was sacked just outside his own end zone, forcing a Raiders punt.

The Oakland defense had no answer to Miami, and the Dolphins extended their lead to 10 points as they marched down the field once again for another touchdown.

Miller continued to lead Miami’s rushing game and, on 4th and 1 at the Raiders 13-yard line, the 23-year-old carved through Oakland’s defense and went all the way to the end zone.

The signs were ominous for the Raiders and they were forced into yet another quick punt on their next drive. Even when Jarvis Landry fumbled the punt return for Miami to hand Oakland possession just short of midfield, the Raiders offense still couldn’t capitalise and were forced to punt again.

By the time the cheerleaders were entertaining the Wembley crowd again at half time the Dolphins led 24-7 over the Raiders

But Miami were having no such problems and Tannehill threw his second touchdown pass of the night just before half-time as he found Dion Sims with an 18-yard reception.

Despite starting at their own 10-yard line, the Dolphins marched 90 yards in just nine plays and little over four minutes to extend their lead to 24-7 at half-time.

It was a near perfect first half for the Dolphins and Tannehill had 17 completions from his 19 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns.

Oakland, meanwhile, picked up just one first down in a hapless second quarter and were immediately on the back foot after half-time as Miami received the ball from kick-off.

It looked like more of the same as Miller picked up some big gains on the ground to take Miami into the red zone once again. But Oakland were given a reprieve when Miller dropped the ball one yard shy of the end zone, forcing a much-need turnover and keeping the score at 24-7.

The Raiders required a scoring drive to pull themselves back into contention, but what they got was another turnover. Carr threw a loose pass and was picked off by Miami cornerback Brent Grimes, who returned the ball all the way to the three-yard line.

That left Miller with the simple task of walking into the end zone untouched for his second touchdown to hammer another nail into Oakland’s coffin.

Cortland Finnegan takes advantage of a fumble on the snap to race away from replacement quarterback Matt McGloin to score another Dolphins touchdown

Raiders head coach Dennis Allen pulled Carr out and brought in Matt McGloin in an attempt to get his offense moving. But a miscommunication on the snap led to a fumble and Miami cornerback Finnegan recovered the ball before returning it 50 yards all the way for another touchdown.

And it didn’t get any better for McGloin or the Raiders on their next drive as the quarterback’s pass was tipped and intercepted by safety Jimmy Wilson.

Miami thought they had their sixth touchdown when Tannehill threw a short pass to Daniel Thomas, but his score was ruled out for offensive pass interference.  

It mattered little, as did Tannehill being intercepted by TJ Carrie, as the game was already over after three quarters.

McGloin salvaged some pride for the Raiders as he hit Andre Holmes for a 22-yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter, but the Wembley crowd had already began trickling out of the stadium by that stage.

Dolphins head coach Philbin said: 'We really haven't played a complete 60-minute game and we haven't played great early in games. After the first score that we gave up, I thought our team settled in and played really well.

'There are a lot of things we will take a look at. We played well but there are a lot of things we could do better.'

On quarterback Tannehill, Philbin added: 'He played very well. He had a good rhythm, good tempo, good command and was very decisive. He threw the ball accurately, made some good decisions and played a very good game.'
