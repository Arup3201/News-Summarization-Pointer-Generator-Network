Wells made up two witnesses to bolster his compensation case against Caerphilly Council

An ex-soldier has been jailed after he falsely claimed £40,000 compensation for falling down steps.

Former Royal Engineer Leon Wells, 30, made the claim three years after his accident - and pretended the delay was because he was serving with Special Forces in Afghanistan.

But a court heard how Wells was caught out - because he was actually serving a prison sentence for manslaughter.

The hearing was told how Wells fell down a set of stairs while on a jog in 2006 and suffered a 'bucket handle tear' in the medial meniscus fibrocartilage in his knee.

He filed a claim against Caerphilly Council alleging his knee injury was as a result of their neglect.

Prosecutor Gareth Compton said: 'Wells fabricated two witnesses to the accident.

'He claimed one witness assisted him and the other gave him a lift home.

'But
when asked about these claims one witness said he knew nothing of the 
accident while the other gave a surprisingly vague and differing 
account.'

Cardiff Civic 
Justice Centre heard how Wells served in the armed forces from the ages 
of 16 to 21 and achieved the rank of lance corporal.

He had served in Macedonia and Sierra Leone - but left because of stress and started work as a plumber.

Wells lodged the compensation claim three years after the alleged slip on the steps.

He claimed he was on a tour of duty in Afghanistan.

But
it was later revealed he was in HMP Parc for manslaughter after he killed
former miner Alan Brown, 45, by punching him twice in the face in a 
fight outside a pub in Tredegar, South Wales in May 2008.

Father-of-three Mr Brown, from New Tredegar, did not regain consciousness after the attack and died of a brain haemorrhage.

The case was finally ready to go to trial in October last year but on the first day of the case he withdrew his claim - incurring legal costs of £61,000.

And the council then launched their own private prosecution against Wells after realising he had tried to scam them.

Simon Goodman, defending, said: 'In cases of this kind, it often happens that claims are simply made up.

'That is not so on this occasion. This was a genuine claim that was falsely boosted, he stupidly, foolishly gilded the lily.

'This is not a man with a history of deception and dishonesty and he apologies for misleading the court.'

Father-of-one Wells, of Abertysswg, near Rhymney, South Wales, admitted contempt of court at the Cardiff Civil Justice Centre.

He was sentenced to another four weeks behind bars yesterday after investigators found his case was fraudulent.

District Judge Wyn Williams told him: 'Parts of your claim were fraudulent, parts of your evidence were dishonest.

'You made up two witnesses to bolster your case, making up falsehoods of this kind must be dealt with extremely seriously.

'You have acknowledged that you have lost a considerable amount through the false aspects of what you say was a genuine claim for damages.

'You have a very large bill of costs that you must pay at of risk bankruptcy.

'Putting forward false evidence is a very
serious contempt of court and in other cases of this kind invariably 
results in a prison sentence.

Wells claimed he was serving alongside troops in Afghanistan. But the former lance corporal was serving three years in Parc Prison for killing former miner Alan Brown (file photo)

'There is no reason to depart from that on this occasion.'

Keith Reynolds, deputy leader of Caerphilly council, said: "Mr Wells' claim raised many questions, which required further detailed investigation of the claim.

'Our fraud investigation team screens every insurance claim and uses fraud indicators to look for questionable claims.

'Every penny paid out to fraudsters is a penny less to spend on vital local services for the people of Caerphilly.'
