President Barack Obama asked Muslim communities in the United States to do more to weed out 'violent extremism' in their communities on Wednesday.

His speech, during a three-day White House summit, addressed the threat of extremism flourishing among Muslims and the need for community leaders to push back on talk that the US is 'at war' with the religion.

'Muslim leaders need to do more to discredit the notion that
our nations are determined to suppress Islam,' Obama said, in reference to talk by extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS. 

Summit: Speaking in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Obama asked Muslim communities to do more to combat 'violent extremism' 

US intelligence officials said last week that up to 150 American may have tried to travel to Syria in an attempt to join militant groups fighting there. 

The White House has been under fire for its stance on groups like ISIS, with some, such as Democrat Representative Tulsi Gabbard, criticizing Obama's refusal to directly blame radical Islam.

'If you look at this broad focus on countering violent extremism, which is very hard to define, it’s a diversion away from the actual threat coming from this radical Islamic ideology that exists,' Gabbard said on CNN's The Situation Room.

In the wake of shocking violence like the murders at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, some have been frustrated by some blaming moderate Muslims for not denouncing violence enough.

Groups are also skeptical about the president's promise to engage with moderate Muslim communities, saying outreach efforts look more like policing the religion.

'It blurs the line between community outreach and intelligence gathering,' Jaylani Hussein, executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations of Minnesota about initiatives promoted by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.

Extremist: Obama has said that ISIS distorts religion in order to justify war. The group released a video Sunday showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians captured by the group.

In Minneapolis, where Johnson visited, US Attorney Andrew Luger was asked in Minneapolis, where Johnson had visited to spearhead programs to educate and empower Muslim youth in order to counter the appeal of extremism. 

Those efforts, Hussein said, should be separated from the Justice Department and the Department of
Homeland Security.
