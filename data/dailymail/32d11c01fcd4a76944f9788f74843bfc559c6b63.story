Brave: Jordan Rice, 13, told rescue workers to make sure his younger brother, Blake, was saved first during the Queensland floods in 2011

The devastated father of schoolboy Jordan Rice, who lost his life during the 2011 Queensland floods, has pleaded with Prime Minister Tony Abbott to have his son recognised for his outstanding bravery.

'You said he was "emblematic of the Australian spirit". You said he should be awarded the Cross of Valour, the highest civilian bravery award. Those words... gave me something past grief,' Jordan Tyson says in an open letter published on Mamamia.com.

Three and a half years after Jordan's father heard the PM commend his brave son, he is still waiting for the Cross of Valour.

However, he now has 180,000 Australians backing his moving petition to have Jordan recognised.

Jordan insisted that rescuers save his little brother first as raging flood waters surrounded them in Toowoomba, Queensland, and his incredible bravery touched hearts all over the world.

The 13-year-old's actions saved his 10-year-old brother Blake's life over his own, as they stood stranded in rising waters with their mother Donna, who also died during the deadly flash flood.

His final words: 'Take my brother first,' led to the promise from Mr Abbott.

In the letter, Mr Tyson describes the moment that he found out his eldest son and wife had died in the horrific floods.

'I was at home one Thursday morning when the police knocked on my door and delivered the news that immediately shattered my life. It was only 32 days later that you would personally stand up in parliament to speak of my son, Jordan Rice,' he writes.

Mr Tyson tells how he has had to battle with the grief of losing Jordan and Donna and at the same time hold it together for his son Blake, who was saved by Jordan.

'In the last three and a half years, I have had moments of feeling very alone. Battling to hold myself together, to support Blake, to hold down a job, to deal with the pain.

'People often ask me how I keep going after losing two of the people closest to me like that. To be honest, I donâ€™t really know. I still live with the pain, probably always will,' he says.

The father waited patiently for Jordan to be awarded the Cross of Valour but all he received was a rejection letter from Australian Bravery Awards Council, two years ago.

'That feeling of Jordan being rejected has only begun easing slightly this week,' he writes.

Mr Abbott wasn't the only politician who spoke out about Jordan's bravery.

Mr Tyson also started his campaign to get his son the award on change.org after former Prime Minister Julia Gillard told him 'the legend of Jordan's amazing courage will go on'.

Ms Gillard met Mr Tyson on a visit to Toowoomba while speaking with flood victims, three months after the devastating floods in January 2011.

During the meeting she even autographed Jordan's brother Blake's cloth sling, which he was using to nurse an arm injury caused by the natural disaster.

'I was so proud. I waited, waited and waited - but it never happened,' Mr Tyson says in a petition on Change.org.

'Nothing will ever bring Jordan and Donna back. But it would mean the world to us to have his last moments of bravery acknowledged.'

The gold Cross of Valour was established in 1975 to replace the British George Cross, previously awarded to Australians, and has so far only ever been given to five men.

It was last awarded in 2003, to two heroes from Western Australia who entered bombed Bali nightclub Paddy's Pub, in the tourist district of Kuta, in 2002 to rescue people, despite ongoing explosions and their own personal injuries.

In January 2011, Jordan, his brother and his mother were trapped on the roof of the family's car as raging floodwater surrounded them.

When a Good Samaritan, Warren McErlean, waded over to rescue the family Jordan insisted his little brother was saved first despite not being able to swim himself.

'Moments later, Jordan and his mum were swept to their deaths,' Mr Tyson said.

Mr McErlean, who saved Blake, told news.com.au he completely backs the petition.

'I'm right behind anything that will remember what Jordan did and goes towards recognising his actions.'

A spokeswoman for Mr Abbott told the website he supported Mr Tyson's calls for Jordan to be appropriately acknowledged.

'Nominations for bravery awards in the Australian Honours system are considered by the Australian Bravery Decorations Council, which makes recommendations to the Governor-General,' she said.

'The Prime Minister has approached the Governor-General to ask for his support in ensuring proper consideration is given to any nominations for bravery awards relating to this tragic incident.'
