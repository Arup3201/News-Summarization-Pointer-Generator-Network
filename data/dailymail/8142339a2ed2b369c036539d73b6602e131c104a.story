Eighteen premature babies were said to be among dozens of civilians who died on one  of the bloodiest days of the Syrian uprising.

They perished yesterday after their incubators failed during power cuts in the rebel-held city of Homs, according to reports.

Government militiamen also killed 19 people from three families in the besieged city after storming homes.

The bloodshed came as Britain accused 
Russia of having blood on its hands by sending arms to Syria for 
President Bashar Assad to slaughter his own people.

Foreign Secretary William Hague told Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to stop sending weapons to fuel the civil war.

Although there was no official 
confirmation of the babies’ deaths in Homs, activist Mohammad Hassan 
confirmed that power had gone down during the terrifying onslaught by 
government forces.

‘We counted 47 killed since midnight,’ he said.

A senior EU official today said the bloc will soon impose harsher sanctions against Syria.

The new measures could include bans
 on importing Syrian phosphates, on commercial flights between Syria and
 Europe, and on financial transactions with its central bank.

Some measures will be adopted at the EU foreign ministers meeting on February 27, but it was not yet clear which.

The EU has already banned oil 
imports from Syria, imposed visa bans and asset freezes against 
government officials and military and police officers.

Bombardment intensified in the early 
morning, he added, targeting Sunni Muslim districts all hostile to 
Assad, whose minority Alawite sect has dominated Syria for five decades.

A group known as the Syrian Revolution
 General Commission put the day’s death toll even higher, at 100. Syrian
 state television blamed explosions on Homs militants. It accused 
‘terrorists’ of targeting a refinery in the city with mortars, while 
activists blamed the army for a fire filmed by residents.   

Another activist said security forces 
had captured a hospital, jailing the injured. The last field hospital in
 Baba Amr was bombed on Monday, he said, adding: ‘We lost ten people 
when we tried to evacuate it.

‘We are using kitchen knives for 
surgery. We don’t have any blood for donations, or oxygen. We are 
calling on help from the whole world.’

A top commander of the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force has arrived in Syria to help 
Assad manage the uprising, a member of the National Syrian Council has 
claimed.

Kassam Salimani has reportedly taken
 up a spot in the Syrian war room, allegedly including Assad himself, 
which manages army manoeuvres against opposition forces.

The Quds Force specialises in 
unconventional warfare on foreign soil - indicating what kind of battle 
Assad wants to bring to his tormentors, haaretz.com said.

The 15,000 elite soldiers that make up the force are in charge of training and funding Hezbollah.

Five European countries and six Arab 
Gulf nations have pulled their ambassadors out of Damascus, and the U.S.
 has closed its embassy.

The UN estimates the government crackdown has killed more than 5,400 people since March.

Last night Syrian army tanks were said to be entering Homs to wipe out any last resistance.

Meanwhile Britain’s new war of words with Moscow escalated as Mr Hague accused Russia of shipping weapons into Syria.

His counterpart Mr Lavrov pointed out that it was not illegal to ship arms to the regime.

David Cameron also joined the row, saying Russia had to ‘look at its conscience’.

Russian premier Vladimir Putin hit 
back, accusing the West of peddling a growing ‘cult of violence’, and 
said Moscow would not countenance a repeat of the Libyan war in Syria.

‘One cannot act like an elephant in a china shop,’ he said.

Open dialogue: William Hague spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov today

Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov today amid continuing anger at Moscow’s decision to block a UN Security Council resolution on Syria.

The Foreign Office said the two men discussed the latest situation in the country by telephone for around half an hour following Mr Lavrov’s visit to Damascus yesterday.

Mr Hague insisted that Western countries were not contemplating military intervention in Syria but said he believed that President Bashar al Assad should now step down.

He also tackled Mr Lavrov about reported Russian arms sales to the regime. Mr Lavrov retorted that such sales were not illegal.

In the Commons, David Cameron was dismissive of Russia’s unilateral attempt at a diplomatic intervention, saying he had 'very little confidence' that it would end the fighting.

He told MPs at Prime Minister’s Questions that the international community had now to work with Syrian opposition groups both inside and outside the country to co-ordinate a concerted opposition to President Assad’s regime.

He said: 'I think the bloodshed in Syria is absolutely appalling. I think the Russians have to look at their consciences and realise what they have done.

'But the rest of the world will keep on fighting as hard as it can to give the Syrian people a chance to choose their own future.'

He accused Russia and China of 'setting themselves against' Arab and world opinion by their decision to veto the UN Security Council resolution.

Mr Cameron yesterday approved plans to train spin-doctors to help Syrian opposition win support.

But despite the move, a report by MPs concluded that Britain's military has been cut so severely it would struggle to wage a campaign in the country.

It said the UK's dwindling and stretched Armed Forces face 'significant challenges' if asked to tackle a crisis alongside the war in Afghanistan.
