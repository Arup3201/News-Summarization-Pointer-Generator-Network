Dismissive: Goalkeeper Richard Kingson said 'false spirits' had possessed his wife and forced her to make the embarrassing claims

The wife of a Premier League goalkeeper has claimed to be a witch who put a curse on him to sabotage his career.

Richard Kingson - the most capped player in Ghana and former star at Birmingham, Wigan and Blackpool - has not played for his country or had a club since last year.

Adelaide Tawiah Kingson went on Nigerian TV two weeks ago to say she had put a spell on her husband to wreck his form - and make him impotent too.

The 34-year-old footballer, known as Olele, yesterday took to Facebook to deny that his wife was a witch and blame her comments on ‘false spirits’ that had entered her during a church service, according to News1ghana.com.

Mrs Kingson also retracted her claim, which was made live on religious satellite channel Emmanuel TV - the station of SCOAN (The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations).

A report from Ghanasoccer.net quoted her as saying: 'I myself had no foreknowledge that I had been possessed. I can’t even remember what took place in the church after I fell down...

'I was only told what the spirit that manifested had said after I regained consciousness. I am not a witch as it has been rumoured...

'My husband knows how inspirational I have been to him throughout his goalkeeping career.'

Olele said that people who wanted to embarrass him had spiritually manipulated the wife to make the bizarre claims.

Speaking at the church a week after the deliverance, Kingson and his wife said all was well in their matrimonial home and that peace and love were restored to their marriage.

SCOAN leader, TB Joshua, prophesied to Olele that he would return to the church within a month to report a restoration of his career and encouraged him not to worry about what people said about his wife.

Mrs Kingson was credited with saving Ghana's Black Stars from shame in 2006 when she advised her husband not to take a $300,000 bribe to let in two goals during a match against the Czech Republic at the 2006 World Cup in Germany.

Kingson admitted he had been tempted because the winning bonus for the match had only been $8,000, but was persuaded not to do it after his wife 'said that her love for me was not because of my money.'

The goalie said he had been faithful to his spouse since they got engaged in 1997.
