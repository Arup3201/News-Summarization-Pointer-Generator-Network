The complex trial of a married man who is accused of strangling his mistress and the 15-month-old child they had together is due to begin this week.

Authorities in St. Petersburg, Florida allege that former Air Force Sergeant Ralph 'Ron' Wright Jr. killed Paula O'Conner and son Alijah in July 2007 after she tried to sue him for their child's medical bills that would expose his infidelity.

Expected to last three weeks and take in more 70 witnesses, the trial hinges on DNA evidence disputed by the defense and centered around a glove found at the scene of the murders that the prosecution say proves Wright, 44, is the culprit.

Police believe that Wright was wearing a pair of gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints at the scene of the crime.

They claim that one of the black gloves was left behind by Wright on the arm of a couch near the victims' St. Petersburg home.

Forensic tests of the glove by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement discovered DNA that belonged to Wright and no one else, according to an affidavit seen by the Tampa Bay Times.

However, a follow up forensic test carried out by a Pennsylvania laboratory discovered DNA inside the glove from the two victims and none from Wright's DNA.

Despite the conflicting reports, prosecutors claim that the glove's origin is key to the case. The glove 'is identical to a small number of gloves issued to the defendant's military police unit,' investigators wrote in a submitted report to the court.

'Those gloves, made of a flame-resistant material called Nomex, were kept in a locked storeroom at the base.'

According to a prosecution affidavit, Wright had access to that storeroom but no records show him checking out any gloves, but security video does show him entering the cupboard at 2 a.m. on July 6th, 2007, three hours before the murders were committed.

Wright has pleaded innocent to the crimes and is being held without bail in the Pinellas County Jail in Florida.

The former Reserve technical sergeant met O'Conner in January 2004 when she was single and working as an insurance underwriter. He said that he was divorced with a 10-year-old son when in fact he was still married with his own family in Orlando.

However, O'Conner, who was 37 at the time of her death failed to ever meet any other family members of Wright's and he would often leave her for weeks at a time to go on 'secret assignment' for the military.

When she became pregnant in 2005, Wright totally disappeared and O'Conner set up a website called Military Dead Beat Dads to tell her story and attempt to find him.

On her web site O'Conner said she met wright in January 2004 when he introduced himself to her and they ended up going to dinner together. He told her that he was from Orlando and had worked as an Orange County deputy before being called up to active duty at MacDill Air Force base after 9/11 as a reservist.

She wrote that the relationship grew, 'We used to talk for hours on the phone...We just seemed to click, the only problem was that he worked nights at the base and I worked days, and he worked A LOT!'

It was soon after they had picked out a ring together that Wright told her that he was being deployed for a secret assignment to the 'Horn of Africa.'

'He asked me if I would wait for him,' wrote O'Conner. 'I agreed. After all, I loved him. He said he loved me and that I was the only one for him.'

When she informed Wright that she was pregnant, he disappeared and the son whom she called Alijah or A.J. was born on April 9th 2006. And almost immediately doctors told her the baby's heart had small holes in a lower chamber and a month later, he had open-heart surgery.

Then, one month later, she notice her son's head had swollen and his eyes had begun to bulge. He was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, or excessive fluid on the brain and he had brain surgery.

When O'Conner could not contact Wright she hired an attorney, John Tuthill and a private investigator who tracked Wright down and discovered he was married.

Three weeks before the murders, O'Conner had Wright served with papers in the MacDill Air Force Base which informed him he was being sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of medical bills and child support.

'He was fearful he was going to lose money in the process of having to support this child,' said St. Petersburg Police Department Major Mike Puetz at the time of Wright's arrest in December 2008.

O'Conner and her child were discovered dead in the morning of July 6th, 2007 by her 18-year-old daughter and her boyfriend when she failed to show for work.

During initial investigations by police in St. Petersburg, Wright denied ever having been romantically involved with O'Conner or indeed of being the boys father.

He told authorities that he had only had a platonic relationship that had ended several years before her death and the he hadn't set foot in her house for years.

Before he was charged, the police had attempted to obtain Wright's DNA but he refused, so when police used a tissue he had discarded after wiping a cut, they discovered that the child was his.

To confirm this, they successfully obtained a court order for a saliva swab in early 2009.

'The basis for the arrest is DNA,' said Puetz.

'We did identify items of DNA in the home that are linked to Mr. Wright, and consequently, as a result of those matches, he was charged.'

Wright's work history is checkered, with two failed stints working with law enforcement agencies.

He spent seven months as a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, from August 1991 to March 1992 and his departure was labeled 'administrative-unfavorable' according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

He also worked for the Eatonville Police Department from October 1994 to July 1996 and his employment ended there when he failed to complete mandatory training, said the FDLE.
