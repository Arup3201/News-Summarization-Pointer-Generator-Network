IN HIS BEST POSITION

Earlier in the season, Emre Can was being written off but for the last two months he has been terrific at centre half and Sunday saw him actually playing in the position he actually thinks is his best. From the base of midfield, the German can pass well and drive forwards in to dangerous areas. He is a great prospect.

MORE THAN A BIG MAN

In the absence of Josh King, much was asked of Rudy Gestede but he managed to deliver. He is certainly terrific in the air and Simon Mignolet will not look forwards to meeting him again in the replay next month. However, there is more to the France-born Benin international. His link-up play was superb all afternoon.

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

Barely a football match takes place these days without a round of applause mid-game. This one came in the 20th minute as Blackburn fans marked 20 years since their team – managed by Kenny Dalglish – won the league title. Dalglish was here on Sunday but chose, rather understandably, not to join in.

NOW IT’S OUR TURN

Still on the anniversary theme, Liverpool’s match programme noted that it was an incredible 35 years to the day since a superb goal from Terry McDermott won a Cup tie at Tottenham. Odd that Liverpool’s own publication should claim the winner of the BBC’s Goal of the Season award was a half-volley. It was nothing of the sort.

SHOW US YOUR MEDALS

Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer will spend a long time trying to emulate his father Ian, who won League titles and European Cups as a player for Nottingham Forest. Bowyer Senior, however, never managed to get his hands on the FA Cup. After this, his son remains in with a shout.
