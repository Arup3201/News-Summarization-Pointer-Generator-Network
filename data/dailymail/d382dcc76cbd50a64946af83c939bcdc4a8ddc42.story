A defiant and unyielding forearm emerges from the rubble - this is the amazing photo of the buried worker who survived a building collapse that killed three people in Thailand today.

The man was helping to build a six-storey block of student flats in Pathum Thani province, just north of Bangkok, when the unfinished structure came crashing down at 4.30pm local time.

Using his free right arm, the desperate construction employee was able to signal for help and was eventually pulled from the heap of twisted metal and concrete.

He was then stretchered away by rescue workers and taken to hospital. 

Thai police say there were 30 construction workers in the area of the building at the time that it came down.

At least seven other trapped labourers have been rescued from the rubble, with the cause of the collapse yet to be identified.

It is believed that 15 injured employees have been taken to hospital while 14 others could still be trapped underneath the debris, the Bangkok Post reports.

It has also been reported that cries for help could be heard coming from the building at 7pm local time. 

In recent years, Thailand has seen a building boom but labor groups have raised concerns over relaxed safety standards and low wages.
