The world’s first suspension bridge connecting two mountain peaks, Peak Walk at Glacier 3000 in the Swiss Alps, has been officially inaugurated as brave souls tested the 351 feet-long walkway at 9,800 feet above sea level for the first time.

The £1.2 million bridge was opened with a ceremony on Friday at Restaurant Botta at the top of the mountain resort between Les Diablerets and Gstaad.

The Peak Walk bridge is just 31 inches wide and connects Glacier 3000 with Scex Rouge and from its platform visitors can see the Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, Eiger, Moench and Jungfrau mountains.

For those who make the effort to get there, entry is free throughout summer and winter.  

Building was delayed by bad weather over the summer and only began in September, with Glacier 3000 chief executive Bernhard Tschannen saying it posed a 'significant challenge'.

Now complete though, the bridge is designed to survive the extreme conditions that come with the Alps, such as heavy snow and winds reaching 200kmh. It can hold up to 300 people at any one time but for added safety and comfort that number will be restricted to 150.

Peak Walk adds to Glacier 3000 attractions that also include a summer toboggan run, a fun park and a snow bus.

Tschannen said the bridge “is a unique addition to our destination'. 

He added: 'It is a touristic highlight that is important for our position in the Asian and European market.”

The bridge is the world's second highest suspension bridge behind the 3,000 feet up Titlis Cliff Walk in Obwalden, Switzerland.
