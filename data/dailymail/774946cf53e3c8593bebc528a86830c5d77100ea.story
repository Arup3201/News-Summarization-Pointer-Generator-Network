Child ‘judges’ and ‘jurors’ as young as 14 are being given the power to punish thugs, arsonists and vandals with soft sentences such as writing poems or drawing posters to atone for their crimes.

Critics have branded the idea a ‘crazy experiment’ full of ‘silly gimmicks’ that trivialises serious offences.

And the pilot scheme is further undermined by a Mail on Sunday investigation which found many of the teenagers passing judgment on their peers have posted inappropriate messages online.

Under the ‘peer court’, offenders are given an astonishing range of lenient punishments after being ‘tried’ by a mock judge and jury composed of young volunteers.

But one 22-year-old potential judge taking part in the taxpayer-funded experiment posted a naked photograph of himself with his private parts covered by a hat on Facebook; a young female volunteer retweeted a racist comment with a photograph of a black woman; while a third boasted on Twitter: ‘It’s 14.00 and we’re already on the drinks!’

A leaked document seen by The Mail on Sunday reveals the full tariff of soft-option sentences available to the court, derided as ‘juvenile Judge Judy’ by one critic.

The scheme will be trialled in Hampshire from next month, and is being monitored by the Ministry of Justice. It could be introduced in other areas, if judged a success.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has expressed enthusiasm for the project, which will run for three years backed with £165,000 of taxpayers’ money, saying: ‘It’s a very interesting idea... We don’t particularly want to give teenagers criminal records if we don’t have to.’

But other Tory MPs are furious at what they see as going soft on crime. Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, West Yorkshire, described it as ‘a crazy experiment’ which sends out the wrong message.

And he said the social media posts of volunteers in the pilot scheme made a mockery of a court’s authority. ‘Are they the pillars of society people would expect to be sitting in judgement on others? I think not.’

Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention said: ‘This scheme combines the worst of soft sentencing and silly gimmicks.

‘Some of the punishments read like a sick joke, trivialising serious crimes. It sets a bad example to young people to imply that if they commit serious offences the only result will be a few hours back in the classroom, or volunteering.’

The Hampshire Community Court will hear up to eight cases a week in a room at Fareham police station.

Cases can only be referred there with the victim’s agreement and both sides will be represented by volunteer ‘advocates.’

Offenders aged between ten and 17 who have admitted guilt will be brought before the ‘judge’, who will be the only participant in the process aged over 18. The upper age limit for court staff is 24.

One test case dealt with by the 16 volunteers during their training  involved a teenage shoplifter. They ruled that he should be ‘educated’ that his offending might harm his chances of getting a job.

He was also ordered to design a poster explaining the damaging effects of shoplifting, and give it to the shopkeeper from whom he stole, along with a letter of apology.

Another case involved a 14-year-old boy who admitted kicking his mother. He escaped with a warning.

Most participants in the project came forward in response to messages posted on social media by Hampshire

Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Hayes and PC Mark Walsh, who became an enthusiast for the idea of peer courts after seeing them in action in America.

Guidelines written by PC Walsh for the judges and jurors say: ‘You are expected to serve as a positive role model... You should remain temperate and dignified and refrain from all morally reprehensible or illegal conduct.’

One volunteer, shop worker Blake Hayward, 23, said: ‘I want to be a police forensic investigator so I thought this would be useful. We’ve learned about court procedures and helping lead the offender in the right direction.

‘It’s trying to get the offender and victim talking to each other in the same room. We are trying not to make the courtroom look too formal as we are dealing with young people and we don’t want to shock them.’

The 12 jury members will wear blue T-shirts bearing the Hampshire Police logo. The court usher will have a black robe but there will be no wigs or formal attire for the judge.

Officials say the panel will only handle offences deemed too minor to be sent to magistrates’ or youth courts, where harsher sentences can be imposed. Mr Hayes said: ‘We’re talking about low-level anti-social behaviour, not serious physical violence or aggravated burglary. 

‘These are young people who have probably committed a crime for the first time and haven’t really understood the consequences.’

Of the criticisms, he told The Mail on Sunday: ‘You’ve picked on what might seem trivial outcomes, but it could be community service to show that the person has understood the consequences of their crime.’

None of the volunteers whose social media output was highlighted by The Mail on Sunday wished to comment, according to Hampshire Police. But Mr Hayes said: ‘The 16 volunteers are from various backgrounds. It is important that the peer jury is reflective of the community. The volunteers highlighted continue to have our full support.’

The Ministry of Justice said: ‘This is not a Government pilot. Serious offences will always go to court where tough punishments are available.’

Volunteer Jo-Jo Navarro-Shrank, who posted a contentious tweet, will also be involved in Hampshire Community Court

They
 are the new faces of Britain’s first ‘peer court’: booze-swilling, 
sex-obsessed and openly offensive... yet apparently qualified to sit  in
 judgment of their peers.

Among them are Tom Trew, 22, who has posted a photo of himself on Twitter, naked except for a hat covering his private parts.

Elsewhere,
 he boasts of sleeping  with a girl whose name he didn’t even know, 
makes explicit references to sex acts, and calls a pal a ‘pikey’.

Fellow
 volunteer Jo-Jo Navarro-Shrank retweeted a photograph of a black woman 
with the message: WHOSE MATTE BLACK MUM IS THIS!???!’ alongside an 
emotion icon  of a laughing face.

The 17-year-old student has also posted: ‘Always feel so at home at nail salons since most of them are Oriental lol.’

At
 23, Blake Hayward, a shop worker, is one of the older volunteers and 
will probably serve as a judge in charge of the proceedings.

So
 it comes as something of a surprise to find a series of online 
photographs of him cavorting with women and men, and one on Instagram 
which shows him in a fat suit dressed as a Sumo wrestler. One of his 
abusive comments reads: ‘Don’t you love  it when people are c***s.’

Another says: ‘This hot piece of meat has just followed me... OMG!’

On
 May 3 this year he tweeted: ‘Another p**** ticked off!!’ and  two weeks 
later he declared:  ‘It is 14.00hrs and we are already on the drinks!’

Drink
 is clearly a hot topic. On May 31 he posted: ‘Why am I at work in my 
birthday?! Wanna just get drunk!!’ And last year he said: ‘I need to 
start going out more  and getting p****d!’

Conservative MP Philip Davies, who believes the courts will only trivialise crime

Just last week Parliament rightly introduced mandatory minimum sentences for knife crime offences with young thugs at the forefront of people’s minds.

Yet here we have the exact opposite – a politically correct ‘Juvenile Judge Judy’ form of justice.

Part of the PC agenda is for everything to be ‘representative’  of the population and this move to have young people ‘judging’ other young people seems to me to be  an example of that fluffy utopian view of the world.

The whole idea sounds like a crazy experiment. By law, 14-year-olds can’t smoke, can’t drink, can’t drive and can’t have sex, and yet it seems that, under these proposals, they could be allowed to influence the judicial process.

Rather like schools which encourage input from children when choosing a new head teacher, this strikes me as yet another example of blurring the line between children being children and adults being adults.

Would it not be far better to  work to stop the culture of children knowing their ‘rights’ before understanding their responsibilities, and tackle the lack of respect  that many show to adults and those in authority?

I think that a stern warning from a respected police officer would scare many children off crime. 

However, if that did not work for some little thugs, an appearance before a proper judge – or even a night in the cells at an early stage – might be much more likely to make them think twice about committing a crime again than being told to complete a first aid course or  write a poem by a panel of their young peers.

Crime should be punished. What sort of a message are we sending to young criminals by trivialising their crime in this way?

You really couldn’t make it up.
