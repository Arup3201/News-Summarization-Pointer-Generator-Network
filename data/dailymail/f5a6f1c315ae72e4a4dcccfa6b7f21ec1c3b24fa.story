An Australian basketballer has turned around a stunning performance on the court after a Twitter troll cruelly joked about bringing along his mother, who suffers from breast cancer,in a hearse.

Hugh Greenwood, 22, from Hobart, Tasmania, performed his first slam-dunk in years playing for New Mexico against the University of Nevada (UNLV) on Thursday. 

The college basketballer said he was motivated to score a whopping 22 points - thought to be close to a career best - after seeing the troll make foul cancer jokes prior to the game. 

'There's a line and it gets crossed,' he said courtside. 'I was motivated tonight.' 

'I got my first dunk since my freshman year and I credit him for getting us a win tonight because that's what motivated me.'

In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia Hugh's mother Andree, who has incurable secondary breast cancer, said she was shocked when he revealed on TV what had him fired up.

Determined: Hugh Greenwood, from Hobart, took to the court for the New Mexico Lobos on Thursday and turned around an incredible performance

According to two family members, this is one of many vile tweets Hugh Greenwood received prior to his inspired performance

Hugh scored his first slam dunk since his first year of university on the courts, and his good form was widely praised on social media

Two handed: Hugh's team, the New Mexico Lobos, won 71 - 69, and victory was certainly sweet

This is one of the vile tweets Hugh Greenwood received, according to two family members

'He's a good kid. He's really had a lot of adversity the past few years, on and off the court, and with my health,' she said. 

'It did give me a bit of a shock when he put it on national TV.'

Mrs Greenwood, whose recurrent cancer has spread to her lungs, was unaware of the vile tweets prior to the match.

'I thought something must of been up when he dunked it (two-handed, mind you!) in the first half,' she said. 

'He looked angry and he doesn't often play "angry"....he is a very "poised and unemotional" player usually.' 

Hugh was paraded on social media following the interview - and the naysayer's tweets have been deleted.

Hugh's younger sister Josie, 20, posted a family text message on social media for the world to see. 

'I love you guys so much. No one messes with my family,' the text said. 

'I couldn't be more proud of my brother,' she added. 

'No one messes with my family': This is the touching family text message Hugh's sister, Josie, sent after his incredible performance on the court on Thursday

When Hugh Greenwood was asked what motivated him by a courtside reporter, she could hardly have expected his fiery response

Action: Hugh Greenwood spent four years at the Australian Institute of Sport before moving to America to pursue his basketball dream

Australia's official basketball association congratulated him on a 'great game'. 

'Australia is right behind you and your family,' Basketball Australia tweeted.

Hugh, in his senior year at university, has become a key player in the New Mexico Lobos side.

Years ago, following his mother's initial diagnosis, he started a breast cancer fundraiser called Pink Pack to raise funds for the cancer research centre at his university several years ago,  

A fan organisation for the opposing team, the UNLV Rebels, even penned him a letter wishing him and his mother the best after the incident. 

'We want to extend our condolences and offer our support as you and your family deal with your mother's diagnosis.

The letter said the fan organisation did not have the funds to make a 'respectable' contribution to Pink Pack, but passed on their best wishes.

'For years we have watched you from the Rebellion as you played with passion, poise and sportsmanship.

'If your efforts consist of the same traits, we believe you will be successful in whatever goals you've set for your organisation's fundraising'

His mother, an avid basketball coach herself, said it was unfair for college-level basketball players to cop online abuse when they are not even professional athletes. 

As for Hugh - who left home when he was 14 to live at the Australian Institute of Sport - he was certainly touched by the overwhelming response to his good form.

'I can't even begin 2 thank everyone directly 4 your kind words over social media. There have been endless amounts,' the guard tweeted.

'All I can say is Thankyou!' 

V for Victory: The New Mexico Lobos defeated the UNLV Rebels 71-69
