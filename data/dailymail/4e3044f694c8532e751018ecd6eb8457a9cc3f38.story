Tunisian politican Beji Caid Essebsi has won the country's first free presidential election

Tunisian politician Beji
Caid Essebsi won the country's first free presidential election,
in the final step of a transition to democracy after an uprising
that ousted autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.

Essebsi beat rival and incumbent Moncef Marzouki with 55.68
per cent of the vote against 44.32 per cent in yesterday's run-off
ballot between the two men, according to results released by the electoral authorities today. 

A former official under Ben Ali, Essebsi recast himself as a
technocrat. His secular party Nidaa Tounes - Call for Tunisia -
profited from a backlash against the post-revolt Islamist
government, which many voters blamed for turmoil after 2011.

Outside the Nidaa Tounes headquarters in the capital Tunis,
several hundred jubilant supporters took to the streets to
celebrate, waving Tunisia's red and white national flag, singing
and honking car horns.

Essebi supporter Aya Khiari said: 'We succeeded in part of our struggle.

'These elections were just one round, but the
battle to build Tunisia just started.'

Marzouki made no immediate statement, but his campaign's
official Facebook page said he had congratulated Essebsi on his victory.

Just after results were announced, protesters set fire to a
Nidaa Tounes party office in Tataouine in southern Tunisia.
Rioting also broke out in another southern town, Hamma, with
police firing teargas to disperse hundreds of youths who burned
tyres to demonstrate against the return of Ben Ali's old guard.

Critics of Essebsi, an 88-year-old former parliamentary
speaker under Ben Ali, see his return as a setback for the 2011
uprising that ousted the veteran ruler and put the North African
country on the road to full democracy, with a new constitution
and free parliamentary and presidential elections.

The Tunisian uprising also inspired the Arab Spring revolts
across North Africa and the Middle East.

U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry are said to have congratulated Essebsi on his victory and Tunisia on its
conclusion of the first presidential election under the new
constitution.

Kerry said: 'Tunisia has provided a shining example to the region and
the world of what can be achieved through dedication to
democracy, consensus, and an inclusive political process.'

Compromise has been important in Tunisian politics.
Essebsi's Nidaa Tounes reached a deal with the Islamist Ennahda
party to overcome a political crisis triggered by the murder of
two secular leaders last year.

As frontrunner, Essebsi dismissed critics who said victory
for him would mark a return of the old guard. He distanced
himself from the corruption and abuses of Ben Ali's era, and
argued that he was the technocrat Tunisia needed following three
messy years of an Islamist-led coalition government.

Marzouki, who had sought refuge in France during the Ben
Ali era, painted a potential Essebsi presidency as a reverse for
the 'Jasmine Revolution' that forced the former autocrat to flee
into exile. But many tied Marzouki to the Ennahda government.

Accepting former regime officials - known as the 'Remnants'
by their critics - back into politics had been one of the
compromises that helped restore calm and keep Tunisia's often
unsteady transition to democracy on track.

Victory for Essebsi consolidates his secular Nidaa Tounes
party's position after it won the most seats in October's
parliamentary election, beating out Islamist party Ennahda.

Essebsi's party will now have to decide on a prime minister
and form a new government in coalition with smaller parties in
the parliament before tackling Tunisia's low-level Islamist
militancy and politically sensitive economic reforms.

Ennahda holds the second largest number of seats in congress
and it and leftist Popular Front movement are still strong
movements that will prove tough opponents in negotiations over
policy in parliament.
