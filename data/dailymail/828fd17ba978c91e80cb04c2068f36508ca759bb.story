Libya's interim Government have captured one of Colonel Gaddafi's last remaining strongholds after a six-week siege.

The National Transitional Council raised their flag over Bani Walid yesterday - bringing to an end one of the few remaining pockets of resistance.

Fighters blasted guns into the air and hoisted the country's new flag over the desert town 90 miles south of Tripoli.

'Bani Walid is completely free. It is 
liberated, 100 percent,' said Mohammed Shakonah, a National Transitional Council military commander.

Supporters of Gaddafi had been holed up in the town for more than six weeks following the fall of Tripoli almost two months ago.

Only a few areas of the dictator's hometown of Sirte remain loyal to him following the collapse of his regime.

In Bani Walid fireworks were being set off and car horns blasted as the city was captured by the NTC.

The streets have been left littered with empty bullet casings and yesterday some buildings were still ablaze and several shops looked like they had been looted.

medical worker and both men wept in joy.

Several buildings were flattened by Nato air strikes.

There was no evidence of civilians 
joining in the street celebrations in Bani Walid, home to the Warfalla, 
Libya's biggest tribe, whose members are traditional supporters of 
Gaddafi.Â 

'This is a very important day because
it now means Gaddafi doesn't have even one town in Libya,' said Ayad 
Sayed al Russi, a senior NTC commander.

'We hope that the residents who fled will come back now that the town is free.'

Celebrations: As fighters mark the capture of Bani Walid, rebuilding work will have to start as fires still smoulder across the town in buildings ransacked during fighting

The town had been under siege for 
weeks, with hundreds of Gaddafi loyalists digging into its steep valleys
and hills resisting advancing interim government forces. NTC officials 
have been negotiating with Bani Walid's tribal leaders for its 
surrender.

However, in Sirte the battle for control is still continuing as Libya's new Government still face pockets of resistance.

Yesterday they had boxed in the remaining Gaddafi loyalists in a small area of central Sirte. The NTC have said they will only begin the transfer to democracy after they capture the city.
