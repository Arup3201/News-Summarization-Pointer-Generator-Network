A girl was sent flying after an out-of-control deer ran through a glass door and ploughed into her.

Samantha Irons, 11, and her eight-year-old brother Sebastian were at a gas station on Sunday when the creature charged through the door.

The siblings were leaving the store with snacks in Dacula, Georgia when the boy spotted the animal coming towards him and leapt out the way. His sister was not so lucky.

Miss Irons told wsbtv.com: 'I see glass everywhere, then I realize that I’m on the ground but at that time, I didn’t realize what hit me. It felt like a car.'

The girl's father ran from his car to the store after hearing the loud bang. He initially thought that a vehicle had lost control and hit his daughter.

Convenience store workers called 911 as Samantha was covered in blood which turned out to  belong to the injured deer.

CCTV from the store shows the stunned animal staggering around the aisles.

Samantha was checked over by 
emergency workers and had a slight concussion, large bruise to her leg 
and a few cuts but no serious injuries.

The store was cleared and the injured deer had to be put down.

This
was not the first time that a deer has ploughed through glass. Last 
month in New Jersey, shoppers at a goodwill store were surprised when a 
deer crashed through the plate glass doors.

Animal experts said it was likely the creatures caught their reflection in the glass, thought it was a rival and charged.

There are 50,000 reports of drivers hitting deer in Georgia every year, according to authorities.
