An adventurous climber has scaled and captured images of some of the world's most dangerous mountains to create an extraordinary set of images showing the beauty of the world's highest peaks.

London based Alexandra Nemeth, 30, travels the globe seeking out some of the most hazardous mountains in her bid to climb the highest peaks on each continent.

Her photographs portray the beauty and intense danger of the inhospitable environments. 

Breathtaking scenery: The sun rising behind Mount Everest, taken from the top of Gokyo Ri mountain. Alexandra tackled Mount Everest, Kilimanjaro, Mount Blanc, Elbrus and Mount Vinson in Antarctica in the last year as part of her Seven Summmit's challenge

Nature at its best: Worthington Glacier in Alaska. The photographer' latest venture will see her tackling the highest mountain on every continent. The money she raises from this feat will be used to raise awareness for eating disorder charity B-eat.

'I love taking photos of every stage of the climb.'

In the last year alone Alexandra has ticked off Mount Everest, Kilimanjaro, Mount Blanc, Elbrus and Mount Vinson in Antarctica, in her Seven Summits challenge, which will see her tackling the highest mountain on every continent.  

The money she raises from this feat will be used to raise awareness for eating disorder charity B-eat.

She commented: 'People ask me how I felt when I stood in front of the mighty Mount Everest with my camera above 5600 meters. Pure exhilaration I always say. You overlook the pain your body has to cope with, the lack of oxygen because the view is worth it and I would happily do it all over again.'

In order to prepare her body for the physical demands and dangers involved with high-altitude climbing, the adventurer takes spinning classes three times a week. 

She also runs with a 20kg backpack for two hours, three or four times a week, and competes in half marathons.

The Matterhorn up close and personal. The photographer described how she initial climbed to get photographs of unique angles of mountains, but now climbing has become as much as a passion for her

Alexandra said: 'Getting to the top of a mountain is the most euphoric, overwhelming and happy feeling in the world.

'But climbing first became important to get to certain points to photograph the mountains from different angles.

'A lot of people trek to Everest Base Camp, but not everyone would climb up the Gokyo Ri peak at 4am in the morning to capture the sun rising behind Mount Everest.

'Now the climbing is as much a passion as the photography.'

Success: Alexandra having conquered Mont Blanc. She said: 'Other cultures, stunning scenery and faces fascinate me and with photography I like to think I take a little piece with me'
