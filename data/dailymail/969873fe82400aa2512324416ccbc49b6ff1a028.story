The family of a much-loved Australian bodybuilding champion who died following complications from a kidney transplant say a Sydney hospital is hiding the truth.

After collapsing at home on August 31, 2011, Luke Wood, 35, was rushed to Westmead Hospital in Sydney where he died from a severe haemorrhage, eight weeks before he was due to be married.

He had undergone a kidney transplant on August 10, but on August 23 his body started showing signs of rejecting the organ.

Days after a kidney transplant, Luke Wood, 35, collapsed at home on August 31, 2011. He rushed to Westmead Hospital in Sydney where he died from a severe haemorrhage, eight weeks before he was due to be married

Mr Wood was taken to hospital and given drugs as dark bruises appeared on his abdomen.

He was discharged on August 26 and told to return for daily check-ups for a month, but died five days later.

His death is being examined by the NSW Coroner - with a particular focus on his treatment at Westmead Hospital.

His fiance told reporters outside the Glebe Coroners Court on Monday that his family feel cheated.

'Obviously there's something that's happened that they're trying to hide and we just want the truth to come out,' Nora Haddad said, with her sister and Mr Wood's sister at her side.

She described her fiance as an inspirational, humble, gentle giant who spent lots of time with fans.

Arnold Schwarzenegger had personally invited Mr Wood to his eponymous bodybuilding competition.

As a younger man Mr Wood played with the Canterbury-Bankstown and Balmain Rugby League junior clubs, where he developed his interest in bodybuilding.

Questions have been raised about whether Mr Wood was on steroids and if they played a part in his death.

"Luke admitted to use of steroids to some medical practitioners," counsel assisting the coroner Patrick Griffin said on Monday.

"His musculature was consistent with the use of steroids."

But Ms Haddad said she didn't believe that steroids should be an issue in this case.

The inquest continues.
