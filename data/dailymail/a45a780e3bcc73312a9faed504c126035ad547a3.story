Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a leading Republican contender for the White House in 2016, has said he doesn't know whether President Barack Obama is a Christian or not.

Despite the fact that Obama has frequently spoken publicly about his Christian faith, Walker maintained on Saturday that he is not aware of the president's religion.

Walker refusal to acknowledge the president's faith, came hours after he had also refused to be drawn on Obama's love for his country in the wake of inflammatory remarks made by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani at a fundraising event for Walker during the week.

On the subject of the president's faith, Walker told reporters at the National Governors Association in Washington that he simply didn't know.

'I've actually never talked about it or I haven't read about that,' Walker said, reports The Washington Post.

'I've never asked him that,' he added. 'You've asked me to make statements about people that I haven't had a conversation with about that. How [could] I say if I know either of you are a Christian?'

Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster later phoned the Post to deny that the governor had been trying to cast doubt on Obama's faith.

'Of course the governor thinks the president is a Christian,' she said. 'He thinks these kinds of gotcha questions distract from what he's doing as governor of Wisconsin to make the state better and make life better for people in his state.'

Earlier Walker had refused to give a clear answer when asked if he agreed with Giuliani's belief that the president doesn't love his country.

'You should ask the president what he thinks about America,' said Walker. 'I've never asked him so I don't know.'

Walker's comments on Saturday came after several days in which he was asked repeatedly whether he agreed with the former New York mayor.

President Obama has often talked about his political faith despite some figures on the right repeatedly suggesting that he is Muslim 

'I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America.' Giuliani had said during his dinner speech.

Some figures on the right have consistently questioned Obama's faith, with some suggesting that he is a Muslim.

Obama, however, has often talked about his Christian faith, as he did recently at the National Prayer Breakfast.

Walker accused the media of being fixated on issues that are not relevant to most Americans.

'To me, this is a classic example of why people hate Washington and, increasingly, they dislike the press,' he said. 'The things they care about don't even remotely come close to what you're asking about.'

Walker said he does not believe that most Americans care about such matters.

Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has said he is standing by his comments that the president doesn't love his country despite receiving death threats in recent days 

'People in the media will [judge], not everyday people,' he said. 'I would defy you to come to Wisconsin. You could ask 100 people, and not one of them would say that this is a significant issue.'

Giuliani said on Saturday that he was standing by controversial statements even though he had received death threats. The former mayor did not say whether he contacted police about the threatening calls.

Giuliani told CNN that despite the death threats, the majority of voice mails left at his office were in support of his remarks made on Wednesday at a private dinner for Wisconsin's Republican Gov. Scott Walker.

'I'm right about this. I have no doubt about it. I do not withdraw my words,' Giuliani told NBC on Friday.

'I do not detect, in this man, the same rhetoric and the same language, the same love of America that I detected in other American presidents including democrats.'

White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Friday that he felt sorry for the man who was once known as 'America's mayor.'

'I can tell you that it's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,' Earnest said.

The White House started the hashtag #ObamaLovesAmerica on Twitter, the hashtag was tweeted more than 50,000 times in 24 hours, with comments both for and against Giuliani's remarks.

Critics have called for the author and former politician to apologize, but Giuliani told NBC that though he never meant to question the president's patriotism, he absolutely will not apologize for saying what he believes.
