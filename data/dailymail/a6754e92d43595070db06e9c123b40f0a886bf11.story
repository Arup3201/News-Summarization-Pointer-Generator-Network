A two-year-old British boy has drowned on the Costa del Sol after exploring a neighbour’s house and falling into their swimming pool.

His father discovered the toddler floating in the pool as he went to search for him and a local gardener rang police after he went missing from his family home.

The
 Foreign Office confirmed the youngster, named locally as Theo Lamb, was
 a British national. His parents have been named locally as Duncan Lamb 
and Alison Pallett.

The child was discovered around 10.45am on Monday in an affluent area of Mijas Costa known as El Coto (stock picture)

The boy’s mother and the couple’s 
landlord were alerted by his father's cries for help as he pulled him out of 
the water and tried to revive him.

Paramedics took over when they arrived less than 10 minutes later - and spent around 40 minutes trying to bring the boy back to life before realising there was nothing they could do to save him.

Investigators are working on the theory child fell into the pool after climbing up some stairs separating his home from the neighbour’s and clambering onto the roof of a garage thought to be above the water.

The child was discovered around 10.45am on Monday in an affluent area of Mijas Costa known as El Coto.

The boy’s family rented the top part of a villa owned by their landlord Fernando Aguilar.

Mr Aguilar, whose eight-year-son used to play with the drowned youngster, told a local paper his father had seen  something floating in the neighbour’s pool by chance as he went up the stairs separating the two properties. He soon realised it was his son.

Mr Aguilar added: 'We don’t know how long the boy had been in the water. He was always playing in the garden but no-one thought something terrible like this would happen.

'My son who plays with him every afternoon came to tell me his dad had jumped onto the neighbouring property.

Paramedics reportedly found his father soaking wet and hugging his son when they arrived on the scene (stock picture)

'I keep a set of keys and went to open it up but sadly there was nothing anyone could do.'

Neighbour Debora Vacaro added: 'The family wasn’t very well known in the area and kept themselves to themselves but we always saw them with their child and this sort of thing really affects you.'

Paramedics reportedly found his father soaking wet and hugging his son when they arrived on the scene.

He was treated for a leg injury sustained as he jumped from the four foot wall dividing the two properties to try to rescue him.

It is not clear yet when an autopsy will take place in Malaga, which celebrated a Bank Holiday today because of a local fiesta.

A Civil Guard source said: 'Everything is pointing towards this being the result of a tragic accident.

'The local police had been alerted to the fact he was missing moments before he was found.'

El Coto residential area is just one kilometre from Fuengirola and has a supermarket, chemist and three restaurants.

Villas and apartments in the area are popular with holidaymakers.

The Foreign Office said in a statement: 'We are aware of the death of a British national on August 18 in Costa del Sol.

'We stand ready to provide consular assistance to the family at this sad time.'
