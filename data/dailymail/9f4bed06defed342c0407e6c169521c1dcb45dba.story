Interest rates could rise earlier than expected thanks to a growth in employment, putting one million mortgage-holders at risk of losing their homes.

A record 30million people are in work and the trend is set to continue, says the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).

If unemployment was to fall below 7 per cent, this would prompt the Bank of England to rethink interest rates, governor Mark Carney has said.

But a separate study suggests a rise in interest rates could leave one million homeowners in danger of defaulting on their mortgages and other debts.

Citizens Advice has warned of a ‘financial ticking timebomb’ if there is even a modest rise in interest rates.

Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘The rising cost of energy, food and travel has been absorbing any spare income people may have. In some cases there is little or nothing left to cope with larger mortgage repayments.’

Even if rates rise gently from 0.5 per cent to 3 per cent by 2018, 1.12million would spend most of their take-home pay on debt repayments, said the Resolution Foundation think-tank.

And if rates rise more quickly to 5 per cent by 2018, two million would be tipped into unsustainable levels of debt.

The Resolution Foundation, which based its analysis on Office for Budget Responsibility projections, said: ‘While record low interest rates have reduced current repayment costs, fewer people than we hoped have used this breathing space to pay off their debts.’
