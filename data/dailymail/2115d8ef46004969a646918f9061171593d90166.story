Two children have been stung by a potentially lethal jellyfish at a beach in Western Australia - marking a possible change in the seasonal migration of the deadly fish.

The children were rushed to hospital for treatment after being stung by a Irukandji jellyfish at Honeymoon Cove near Pilbara.

The jellyfish sting is so strong it leaves victims in such severe pain that experts say it makes people feel like they're dying. 

It comes after a mother and her six-year-old son were also stung swimming at Wellington Point beach in Brisbane on New Year's Eve.  

Two children have been stung in Western Australia by the Irukandji jellyfish - it delivers a potentially fatal sting that sparks a surge of adrenalin, driving up the heart rate and prompting a feeling of impending doom

Raelene Murphy and her young son Sebastian both suffered excruciating pain and thought they were dying when they were stung in a separate incident in Brisbane last week 

The Irukandji, native to northern Australia, delivers a potentially fatal sting that sparks a surge of adrenalin, driving up the heart rate and prompting a feeling of impending death.

‘After a delay of a varying number of minutes, you will start to feel totally nauseous. You experience chronic cramps and spasms, vomiting, and a feeling of impending doom-you feel like you're going to die,' marine biologist and jellyfish researcher, Lisa-Ann Gershwin, told Daily Mail Australia.

The location of the latest reported sting shows a change in their seasonal migration, according to Ms Gershwin.

'There has been a spate of stings in Moreton Bay in Western Australia. There has been more stingings in West Australia than North, which is quite out of the ordinary,’ she said.

The creature has been described by an expert as: 'unusual and the second most potent I've ever seen'

Raelene Murphy and her young son Sebastian both suffered excruciating pain when they were stung in Brisbane last week. 

'I took off my reef shoes and pulled the tentacles off my feet,' Ms Murphy told Daily Mail Australia.

She said her son must have walked straight into the creature as he was only about a metre away from her in the water as he walked towards his mother after she was stung.

'I asked people nearby to take care of Sebastian and make sure he was OK because I was having problems breathing and I had pains in my chest,' Ms Murphy said.

The mother of two was convinced that she was having a heart attack as the unbearable pain spread to her lower back, legs and arms.

'I thought I was dying and my son said he thought he was dying too,' she said.

'The first ambulance took my son who was vomiting, frothing at the mouth and his lips had turned blue.'

Sebastian needed three shots of adrenalin and one shot of morphine before being monitored in hospital for the night.

His mother received two shots of morphine in order for the excruciating pain to subside.

This week, two children have been stung by Irukandji jellyfish at a beach in Western Australia

Gershwin said the location of the tiny fishes, which are generally one cubic centimetre in length, shows a possible change in their seasonal migration

The sting can also cause hypertension and soaring blood pressure-even in those who don’t suffer from high blood pressure normally.

This is the symptom which can have fatal consequences, as in the case of the two recorded irukandji deaths.

‘As long as those who are stung can receive immediate treatment-which includes the application of vinegar to the sting site-then patients are usually fine,' Ms Gershwin said.

'It’s the remote fishermen or swimmers who are a worry. Often, the symptoms of a irukandji bite cannot be detected afterwards, so there is likely much more deaths that have gone unrecorded.’

Ms Gershwin recommends speaking to lifeguards, either on the beach or on a hotline, to check if the beach has had an influx jellyfish of late.

'I also encourage wearing full body stinger suits during jellyfish season to eliminate the threat of being stung,' she said.
