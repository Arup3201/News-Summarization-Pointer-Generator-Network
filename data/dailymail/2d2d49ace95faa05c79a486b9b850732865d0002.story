A nine-year-old boy was shamed by his worried mother on television and 'grounded until college' after spending the night at a friend's house without telling her, sparking a major police search.

Christian Stewart rode his bicycle to his friend's place for a haircut about 6.30pm Wednesday, but didn't return to his Pomona, California home.

Fearing the worst, his mother Jody Coover called police who searched for the boy for several hours, while she and her family door knocked neighbors and posted information about Christian.

Embarrassed: Christian Stewart, 9, was found five blocks from home at a friend's house 13 hours after his mother reported him missing

Justification: Christian Stewart was forced to explain his whereabouts in front of TV cameras with his mother, Jody Coover, by his side

'When he wasn't here between 8.30, nine, we started calling everybody,' she told NBCLA. 'We couldn't find him anywhere and nobody had seen him.'

'Our worst fear is that somebody has him and he can’t come back – and I’m hoping that isn’t true. I’m hoping that he’s O.K. and maybe he spent the night somewhere, and maybe some parent didn’t bother to call us and let us know,' she told KTLA.

It wasn't until Thursday morning - about 13 hours after he was reported missing - that Christian was found just five blocks away from home.

Coover's friend found him at a friend's house after searching the area. Christian's relatives said they didn't know the family the boy was staying with.

Safe: Police escorted Christian Stewart to his Pomona, California home on Thursday morning after he was found

Sorry: Jody Coover told her son Christian Stewart he was grounded until at least college, before embracing him in front of the cameras

Angry: Christian Stewart's grandmother said her family did not know the family with which Christian was staying

While Coover was relieved to have her son home safe, she made sure he learned his lesson.

After
being escorted to his front door by police on Thursday, Christian had 
to explain himself and apologize in front of scores of waiting camera 
crews.

The embarrassed-looking child said he didn't call his mother because the phone wasn't charged.

'I
spent the night at my friend's house but I couldn't call her [mom] 
because my friend said the phone was only for people who lived around 
and...they said it didn't work for long distance,' he told NBCLA.

'So I went to go to my other friend's house. She said I couldn't use the phone because it was charging.'

He said he didn't know everyone was looking for him.

'I'm scared now. I didn't think she [mom] would do this,' he told aol.com.

Christian apologized to his mom and grandmother before hugging them.

'He is going to be grounded until he's probably going to college. I'm not going to yell, I'm not going to make a deal,' she told aol.com.

'i'm just so glad that he's home. I've been hugging him, I've been kissing him. He's my baby. I cannot believe he would do that.'

The boy's grandmother told NBCLA her family did not know the family with which Christian was staying.

'Somebody's parents didn't think that they should call us, which I think is absurd,' she said. 'Something wasn't right there.'
