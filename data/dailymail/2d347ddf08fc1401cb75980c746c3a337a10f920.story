The home where a serial killer raped and murdered 11 women was knocked down today after the victims' families feared it was being turned into a sadistic shrine.

The home of Anthony Sowell, 51, was razed just before dawn, a day after relatives of those who died were hand-delivered letters notifying them of the demolition in Cleveland, Ohio.

Police had gone to Sowell's house in 2009 to investigate a rape claim when they found two bodies on the floor in a room next to his bedroom. They eventually discovered three more bodies and a skull in the house and five bodies buried in shallow graves in the back yard.

House of horrors: A demolition crew began razing the home where 11 women were murdered and entombed by Anthony Sowell in Cleveland, Ohio

Good riddance: A demolition crew moved into clear the site as shouted 'Hallelujah' from across the street

Work commenced as several people stood across the street in Cleveland, Ohio chanting: 'Tear it down!' and 'Hallelujah!'

Sowell, 52, has been sentenced to death 
for the killings and is appealing his conviction. Prosecutors said he 
lured women to his home by promising them alcohol or drugs.

By late morning, the home was almost completely levelled. Razing the house will help the families move forward, said Frances Webb-Speed, the sister of victim Janice Webb.

Mrs Webb-Speed told The Plain Dealer: 'A lot of the families still live in the neighborhood and it will be good for it to be gone. The place is an eyesore and some people have tried to use things from the home for personal gain.'

Blasted: The house had been condemned by local authorities in September after relatives worried that it was becoming a gruesome tourist attraction

The murdered women began vanishing in 2007. Police 
discovered ten bodies and a skull at Sowell's house in late 2009 after 
officers went there on a woman's report that she had been raped at the 
home.

Neighbors blamed a stench from the 
rotting bodies on an adjacent sausage factory, which spent $20,000 on 
new plumbing fixtures and sewer lines to try to make the smell go away.

Many of the women who turned up dead had been missing for weeks or months, and some had criminal records.

At the trial of Sowell four months ago, 
gruesome details emerged about the women's deaths from Dr Elizabeth Balraj, the former chief deputy 
coroner for Cuyahoga County who autopsied five of the bodies.

She testified the victims were strangled and bound with apparently random items, including shoe-strings, socks, a belt, a bag strap, a coaxial cable and a cell-phone charger cord.

Dr Balraj also provided more details about the state of the victim's bodies found at Sowell's house, testifying those she examined were nude or nude from the waist down, some wrapped in blankets and plastic and bound at the hands and wrists.

She testified that the plastic 
bucket that held the skull of one victim Lasanda Long had 'no evidence of 
decomposition' and that the bucket had 'non-human bite marks' around the
rim.

It's unclear what will become of the 
site. Some family members and city officials have suggested that a 
monument or community garden could be created.
