The family of a terminally ill South Carolina girl who is dying of a rare genetic disorder have voluntary put themselves in quarantine for the last six months as they fight to find a cure for their daughter's sickness.

Glenn and Cara O'Neil have had little-to-no contact with the outside world since May in an effort to prolong the life of little Eliza, who suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A), a genetic and terminal disorder that means she lacks an enzyme vital for normal cellular function.

The condition eventually causes a lethal buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate - leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems. 

Victims typically die before they are out of their teens.

Family: Eliza (pictured with her father, Glenn, mother, Cara, and brother Beckham) was born with the terminal disorder

Father and daughter: The youngster (pictured with her father) lacks an enzyme vital for normal cellular function, causing a lethal buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate -  which leads to leaning and behavioral problems

Quarantine: Cara O'Neil wipes down groceries before allowing them into the house

Protective: A team from Inside Edition don special suits before entering the O'Neil's house

Outdoors: The height of the family's outdoor fun is doing circles on their yard on bikes

Mrs O'Neill has quit her job as a pediatrician and homeschools Eliza's older brother, seven-year-old Beckham.

Mr O'Neil also works from home.

The family's food is ordered online and all of the groceries have to be wiped down with disinfectant wipes when they arrive at the house.

Everything else they need is ordered on Amazon.

'It was something that we could do to protect Eliza,' Mrs O'Neil told Inside Edition.

'We've heard, ''You're being overly cautious'', but how can you be overcautious when you're talking about the chance of life for your child?' Mr O'Neil added.

While they believe the quarantine will help her live longer, Eliza's family realize the only way to really save her is to find a cure.

They launched a fundraising campaign for the disease nearly a year ago.

They expected her to lose her ability to speak by her fifth birthday, which was last weekend.

Aalthough the she can still talk, Mr O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things.

'It's the disease beginning to catch up with her,' he told ABC News. 'This disease just kind of taunts you. You don't know when things are coming but you see them happening.'

To celebrate her birthday on Sunday, Eliza had a party with her father, mother Cara and brother in the family's backyard, where Mr O'Neill dressed up like a clown and juggle.

As far as outdoor acitivites go, the family ride bikes in circles in their yard.

Campaign: To celebrate her fifth birthday on Sunday, Eliza had a party with her family. The family hoped to raise $600,000 on the day as part of their push to find a cure

But even the milestone celebrations will not distract  the O'Neill's from their fundraising efforts, with the family hoping to raise a staggering $600,000 on the day to help fulfill Eliza's wish to live. 

They have already gained more than $1.7 million on a GoFundMe page, and another $400 elsewhere, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza.

Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A) is a genetic and terminal disorder that affects around one in 70,000 live births.

Victims lack an enzyme that is essential for normal cellular function.

The condition eventually causes a buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate - leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems.

Sufferers typically die before they are out of their teens. There is no known cure.  

The funds - which have come from more than 26,000 donors from 70 different countries - means the family is close to their goal.

Although there is no guarantee that the treatment will get approved or work - or that Eliza will get into the clinical trial - her father said he and his family had to try.

'If we don't get the trial funded, and we don't get it up and running, the guarantee is that she has no chance,' he told the news station. 

He added that the family has remained at home for the past six months to prevent Eliza from catching any viruses. 

Her mother, a pediatrician, has left her job, while her brother is being homeschooled. 

'We're trying to do everything we can to keep her as happy and as healthy and as sharp as she can be,' said Mr O'Neill, who describes the disease as 'a parent's worst nightmare'.

'For the next however many months it takes to get to the point where, hopefully, she can be treated.'

Siblings: The O'Neill's have already gained over $1.3million on a GoFundMe page, and another $400 elsewhere, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza (seen with her brother)

Kindhearted: Donors have so far raised a staggering $1.75 million on the GoFundMe page (right) for Eliza (left)

Sanfilippo Syndrome, named after pediatrician Sylvester Sanfilipoo, affects around 1 in 70,000 live births, said Doug McCarty, a researcher at Nationwide Children's hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

While there is currently no cure, the hospital  has found a potential gene therapy that, in a study, successfully rid mice of heparin sulfate buildup, according to Fox News.

Researchers have proposed what they feel is a sufficient toxicology plan to move forward with the clinical trial. They aim to go ahead with the treatment in 2015.

It is this therapy - a 'glimmer of hope' - that Eliza's family hope they will be able to fund.  

Trying his best: 'We're trying to do everything we can to keep Eliza as happy and as healthy and as sharp as she can be,' said Mr O'Neill (pictured), who describes Sanfilippo Syndrome as 'a parent's worst nightmare'
