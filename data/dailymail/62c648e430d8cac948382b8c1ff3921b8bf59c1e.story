Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho thought Arsenal trio Laurent Koscielny, Calum Chambers and Danny Welbeck should have bee sent off during Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge - but refused to criticise referee Martin Atkinson .

The Portuguese boss thought the three Arsenal stars, who were all cautioned, should have seen red rather than yellow during the Premier League encounter. 

After the final whistle, Mourinho was seen having a rare public chat with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.  

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho thought Arsenal should have finished the game with eight men

Martin Atkinson decided to caution Laurent Koscielny for a foul on Eden Hazard inside the penalty area

Mourinho was of the opinion that Koscielny should have been given a straight red for his foul on Hazard

Mourinho said: 'I think the referee, from a technical point of view, had a fantastic performance in a difficult, technical, fast match with lots of runs behind - also the linesmen had a difficult game and I think they did a fantastic job.

'But Arsenal could have finished with eight men, because it is a red card for Koscielny, it is a double yellow card for Chambers in the first half, and clear was a red card for Welbeck.

"But I accept that the Welbeck red card was not given - the game was over and Welbeck is a good kid and is not aggressive. It was maybe just a reaction, some frustration.

'So I have no complaint really.' 

Arsene Wenger shoved Mourinho in the chest with 20 minutes gone at Stamford Bridge on Sunday 

Mourinho downplayed his first half touchline bust-up with Arsenal manager Wenger by insisting it was 'no problem'.

Asked about the incident, Mourinho said: 'For me, it is over.

'But the technical area is very clear - I have mine, he has his and he cannot come to mine, especially to put pressure on the referee to give a red card to my player.

'So I just told him "leave my technical area and don't come back please".'
