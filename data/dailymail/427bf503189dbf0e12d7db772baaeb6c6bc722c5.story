A huge stash of contraband cigarettes and Viagra-style sex pills were found hidden in an armchair after undercover trading standards officers carried out a surveillance operation.

Officials watched the Harbord Harbord pub in Middleton, Greater Manchester, after a tip-off that contraband products were being secretly sold without bosses’ knowledge.

They followed a suspected rogue dealer from the JD Wetherspoon's pub to a nearby house in Langley.

Police found a stash of contraband cigarettes and Viagra-style tablets hidden in an armchair during a raid in Middleton, Greater Manchester

During a police raid at the property, a Samurai sword, a dagger and an air rifle were discovered.

Officers also found 20,000 contraband cigarettes hidden in the lining of three sofas, behind books, in divan drawers and a bread bin.

Among the concealed packets of Ronson cigarettes - allegedly being traded for around £3 each - were 40 kilos of hand-rolling tobacco and 800 sildigra-100 tablets, which are used to treat erectile dysfunction and are similar to Viagra.

No duty had been paid on the cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco, which was also said to be counterfeit.

These illegal cigarettes were found at the house after officers watched the Harbord Harbord pub in Middleton after a tip-off that contraband products were being secretly sold without bosses' knowledge

A 58-year-old man was arrested and interviewed on suspicion of counterfeiting offences. He was released on bail pending further enquiries and must return to a police station next month.

Estimates suggest Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs loses around £1.9billion of tax each year because of the huge trade in tobacco smuggling.

The illicit trade is said to fund serious crime around Greater Manchester.

Coun Jacqui Beswick, from Rochdale council, said: 'I would urge members of the public to report anything suspicious by phoning the citizens advice consumer service on 08454 04 05 06. Alternatively they can contact the police on 101.'
