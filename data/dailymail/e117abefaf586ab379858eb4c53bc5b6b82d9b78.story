Manchester City right back Bacary Sagna was cheered on by his wife Ludivine at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

Sagna's new team claimed a point against Premier League title rivals Chelsea as Frank Lampard scored a late equaliser to deny Jose Mourinho's side from claiming all three points.

Ludivine posted a snap of herself posing in the stands along with three of her friends - including fashion stylist Siham Aiachi and celebrity car customiser Yianni Charalambous.

Frank Lampard scored against his former side to ensure the hosts claimed a point against their title rivals

Former Arsenal star Sagna came on for the last 20 minutes of the Premier League encounter after his main rival for a first team spot, Pablo Zabaleta, saw red after picking up two yellow cards.

Sagna will be hoping to capitalise on Zabaleta's dismissal as the Argentine international will now serve a one-match ban.

The France international had featured in just two competitive games before Sunday's match at the Etihad as Zabaleta remains Manuel Pellegrini's first choice right back.
