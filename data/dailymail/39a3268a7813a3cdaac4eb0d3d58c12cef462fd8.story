The mother of EastEnders star Steve McFadden's child was arrested yesterday after the soap actor claimed she attacked him in his car.

McFadden reported former lover Rachel Sidwell, 45, to police and is said to have scratches on his back and shoulders following the alleged assault.

Skin specialist Dr Sidwell, who has a two-year-old daughter Amelie Tinkerbell with the 52-year-old actor, was arrested at 7.30am yesterday and spent Valentine's Day in custody.

Happier times: McFadden and his now ex-lover Rachel Sidwell, pictured in 2009 met on the school run and had a year-long relationship

Three Met Police officers arrested Dr Sidwell at the Â£1m home she shares with her husband and children.

McFadden, who plays hard man Phil Mitchell in the BBC soap, is said to have met Dr Sidwell in 2008 on the school run.

She left her husband, who is a surgeon, and three children within weeks of meeting the soap actor and fell pregnant during their year together.

However, the pair were involved in a series of
spats and the relationship ended in September 2009, with Dr Sidwell declaring that TV hardman McFadden 'could not be trusted'.

Dr Sidwell returned to the family home after the split.

The pair, who both have three children from previous relationships, split in 2009. They have a two-year-old daughter, Amelie Tinkerbell, together

Veteran: Steve McFadden, 52, has played Phil Mitchell in EastEnders since 1990

Just weeks later McFadden was arrested after an allegation of harassment, thought to have been made by Dr Sidwell. The case was dropped, however.

McFadden also has a son Matt, 24, with childhood sweetheart Sue Marshall and two daughters with ex-girlfriend Angela Bostock.

The veteran soap actor has played Phil Mitchell in EastEnders since 1990.

A Met Police spokesperson confirmed a man in his 50s had reported an alleged attack on Sunday.

The spokesperson said yesterday: 'This morning, a woman in her 40s was arrested in connection with the investigation.'
