When Steve Hansen first saw Richie McCaw playing for Otago Boys High School, he knew the 17-year-old was something special.

Immediately he instructed his former employers at the Canterbury Crusaders to sign the youngster who will, under the watch of Hansen, captain the All Blacks for the 100th time on Saturday.

In doing so, McCaw will further cement his name into New Zealand folklore. It is fitting that his milestone will be reached in Cardiff, where the iconic No 7 played his first game as captain back in 2004.

The 33-year-old may be reaching the closing stages of his career, but his appetite to win is no less than in his first Test in 2001. That, according to Hansen, is what makes his former academy graduate ‘probably our greatest rugby player ever’.

‘Even now, after 136 Tests, he still wants to be better,’ said Hansen. ‘He’s still knocking on the door asking, “How can I be better?” Richie’s game has continually evolved over time.’

The evolution started over dinner with his uncle at a McDonald’s in Otago, New Zealand. McCaw was preparing for his first age-group trial and his uncle mapped out the journey to become an All Black on the back of a napkin. 

He told McCaw to sign the napkin with the words ‘Great All Black’, but McCaw felt uncomfortable and instead went under the pseudonym ‘G.A.B.’.

The first major step of his career was to move north and join up with Hansen at the Crusaders academy. His work-rate meant he left school with top grades, but his reaction to scoring 99.4 per cent in his maths exam was: ‘I missed one bloody mark.’ That competitive nature carried through and Hansen recalls the hunger he showed at one of his first senior training sessions.

‘Toddy (Blackadder), Reuben (Thorne), Razor (Scott Robertson) and Angus Gardiner came up to me at one point and said, “Listen, if he comes into another ruck and pinches another ball, then we’re going to snot (slap) him”.

‘I said, “If you snot him, then I’ll be snotting the lot of you. Leave him alone, he’s only a baby. Just look after him and get there quicker than he is”. He started setting standards at training because he made it real. He didn’t know any different. I had to tell him, “Just let them win a couple, will you, you’re starting to p*** them off!”.

‘He wasn’t a natural athlete; he had four feet and couldn’t catch a cold. What he had was a massive capacity to learn and he always wanted to be better.’

Now McCaw is the pillar of experience among the new generation of Brodie Retallick, Julian Savea and Beauden Barrett; a youthful trio who will all be central figures in Cardiff tomorrow night.

Wales lit the touch-paper with comments that New Zealand are ‘there to be taken’, but Hansen does not think they believe their own words.

‘They probably feel like they have to say it,’ he said. ‘Sometimes we find our inner belief by talking. History gives you self-belief but success gives you more.’

That self-belief runs through the veins of New Zealand, especially those of their Great All Black.
