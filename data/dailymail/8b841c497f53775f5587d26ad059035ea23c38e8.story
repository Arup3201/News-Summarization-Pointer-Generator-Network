A British Airways plane from London to Canada was forced to abort its flight after smoke was discovered in the cockpit.

The captain of the airline's Boeing 767, which departed Heathrow Airport on Tuesday, requested a priority landing following the emergency.

Cabin crew on board Flight 103 reported seeing smoke in the cockpit of the Calgary-bound plane, which departed London at 5.35pm.

They acted 'decisively' in the face of a sudden emergency, according to a British Airways spokesman.

Reports claim the priority landing was requested as the plane was flying over Liverpool.

Spokesman Michele Kropt, who did not confirm how many passengers were on board the flight, said: 'The flight crew reported seeing smoke in the cockpit.

'It landed safely and all passengers disembarked as normal.'

Engineers are now inspecting the plane.
