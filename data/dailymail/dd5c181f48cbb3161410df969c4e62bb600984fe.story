Hospital bosses have apologised after a woman who had just lost her unborn child was sent a letter offering her a tour of the maternity ward.

Rebecca Mazrreku, 25, was heartbroken when doctors failed to find her baby's heartbeat after 12 weeks of pregnancy.

She had to have a medically-induced miscarriage at home.

Mrs Mazrreku, who was expecting the baby this month, was shocked this week to receive a letter from her hospital trust.

It told of the closure of one nearby hospital's maternity department and offered her the chance to tour a newly-expanded labour ward at the nearby Queen’s Hospital, Romford.

Mrs Mazrreku, who is married to Nick, a builder, and has a four-year-old son, Aden, said: ‘I am shocked, appalled and extremely upset by the lack of consideration or knowledge in regards to my loss. To send me a letter such as this is disgusting and very painful.

‘It begs the question whether they check notes or their systems or even if they have any real clue as to what they are doing.’

Mrs Masrreku, a former estate agent from Rainham, Essex, added: ‘I managed to come to terms with what happened, but it's never far from my mind.

‘It was a very stressful and upsetting time for me and my family.

‘We will try for another baby, but I need to recover first.’

Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospital Trust blamed an administrative error.

Director of midwifery Wendy Matthews said: ‘I sincerely apologise to Mrs Mazrreku for this mistake, and for any distress caused.

‘Unfortunately our computer system had not been updated as Mrs Mazrreku did not miscarry in one of our hospitals.

‘We will be looking again at the systems we have in place with our community teams to ensure that this does not happen again.’

This is not the first time that Queen's Hospital, Romford, has been involved in a scandal.

New mother, Elizabeth Hart, has told how she was left in agony after doctors at the hospital failed to notice that her placenta had not been delivered two months after the birth of her daughter.

The condition could have been fatal if it had not been discovered.
