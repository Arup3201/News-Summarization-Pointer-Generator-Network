Tragedy: Samuel Epps, 11, died of an apparent suicide Tuesday night after shooting himself

A young boy is dead in what is being considered an apparent suicide after firing a single bullet into his head earlier this week.

Samuel Epps, 11, of San Tan Valley, Arizona, was home with his father and three siblings Tuesday evening when, after getting into an argument over his chores, he ran off and locked himself in the house's master bedroom. 

Moments later, he reportedly turned a gun on himself and fired.

'Initial information indicates that Samuel had been asked to complete some chores and he became upset,' Pinal County Sheriff's Office spokesman Tim Gaffney said in a news release.

'Samuel went into the home's master bedroom and a short time later a single gunshot was heard by other family members.'

According to NBC 12, investigators believe that Samuel used an off-duty weapon belonging to his father, who is a supervisor with the Arizona State University Police Department.

It is still unclear how exactly he got the handgun. 

When medical personnel arrived on the scene, they reported that Samuel was still breathing and had a pulse, but he was pronounced dead two hours later after being flown to Maricopa Medical Center.

'This child, from our understanding, had no intention to play with the weapon but to harm himself, and so that dramatic decision was made in this young child's mind to likely result in ending his life,' said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu.

There is no evidence that Samuel exhibited depression, mental illness or suicidal thoughts, according to detectives. 

Devastated: Many have donated money to help the family pay for Samuel's funeral

The family is said to be 'devastated' according to a page trying to raise funds for Samuel's funeral. 

So far, they have collected over $20,000.
