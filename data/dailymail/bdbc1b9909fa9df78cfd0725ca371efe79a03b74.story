A disgruntled staff member at an Outback Steakhouse restaurant has posted a complaint made by a guest that the staff member's accents weren't Australian enough.

The complaint read that the customer was 'not satisfied' with the restaurant because 'nobody spoke Australian.'

Outback Steakhouse is actually an American franchise with 116 restaurants around the world, including seven in Australia.

The accent complaint doesn't state which restaurant the complaint was made about.

The complaint posted to Reddit by user themeandoggie on Monday was made on August 19. The caption attached to the post reads: 'I work at an outback. someone actually complained about this.'

A manager from an Outback Steakhouse, who wished to remain anonymous told Daily Mail Australia: 'It makes no sense, if anyone complains about an accent I'd be questioning that.'

'The brand Outback Steakhouse isn't Australian, it's from America, and we have restaurants around the world not just in Australia,' he said.

'We hire staff from all nationalities and who have different accents, there is no one Australian accent.'

The Outback Steakhouse website describes their restaurants as: 'Outback Steakhouse is an Australian steakhouse restaurant.'

'The Company's strategy is to differentiate its restaurants by emphasizing consistently high-quality food and service, generous portions at moderate prices and a casual atmosphere suggestive of the Australian Outback.'

The steakhouse's website also states that the brand is owned by OSI Restaurant Partners, LLC, headquartered in Tampa, Florida.

'It was probably a comment that was made in passing but holds not much value to us,' said the restaurant manager.

'In a way it saddens me as a person who has immigrated to Australia. I'm Australian but would they not consider me that because I don't have the accent they deem Australian?'

The restaurant manager also stated that Outback Steakhouse performs rigorous tasks in reading, writing and mathematics as well as a face-to-face interview to ensure the staff are able to perform to an outstanding level.

'We want to provide the best service possible to our customers, and that has nothing to do with our backgrounds or our accents.'
