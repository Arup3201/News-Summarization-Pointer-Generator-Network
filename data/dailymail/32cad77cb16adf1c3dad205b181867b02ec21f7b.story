A woman whose giant legs kept her a prisoner in her bed for five years is now able to walk again after finally seeking help.

Sophia Loots, suffered from lymphedema which caused her legs to swell to 10 stone each. But she was too ashamed of her weight to go to the hospital for a diagnosis - thinking it had been caused by overeating.

The 42-year-old, from Cape Town, South Africa, saw her weight balloon from 14st to almost 50st after being bitten by a mosquito in 2006. It is likely that the insect was carrying filarial larvae, which blocked the fluid draining passages within her lymphatic system causing her legs to swell.

Lymphedema is most often caused by parasitic worms blocking fluid draining passages within the lymphatic system. This causes huge swelling especially in the legs

The foster mother of two children grew so heavy she was unable to perform simple tasks such as washing or going to the toilet unaided.

Sophia became depressed and turned to food for comfort, which caused her weight to increase even further.

She developed elephantiasis due to the severe lymphedema, when her skin thickened and swelled further.

But following a public appeal to save her life Sophia was put on a radical diet plan and lost 3st 9lbs in 25 days. This was enough weight to make her eligible for surgery.

She was transported to Johannesburg on a mattress in the back of a van for the treatment. Under the leadership of Dr Dirk le Roux the excess fluid was drained from her legs before the sagging skin was removed.

Mrs Loots said: 'I honestly thought I was going to die in my bed. It was terrible - my kids had to come home from school to help me go to the toilet.

'My husband worked away a lot and I spent my time alone in bed knitting or listening to the radio or in tears.'

Mrs Loots says she can enjoy being a mother to her adopted daughters Marita, 17, and Nolene (right), 14, again. Her husband Manie, 66, worked away a lot and she spent much of her time at home crying

At one point Sophia's eating got so out of control she would eat a loaf and a half of bread with a block of cheese and three family bags of crisps every day. She also swilled down 10 cups of coffee with five sugars and cream, two litres of cola

She said: 'Food was my only comfort in the end. In the space of five years I lost everything, I could barely call myself a mum.

'My legs felt like they were on fire all the time. I was in agony - it was torture.'

Sophia and her husband Manie, 66, fostered Marita, 17, and Nolene, 13, ten years ago, but the girls ended up caring for Sophia. At one point it took five people to lift Sophia's legs to be able to wash her.

But after having surgery to drain her legs and remove the excess skin, Sophia is now down to 20 stone.

Mrs Loots underwent manual lymph drainage in Johannesburg followed by surgery to remove excess skin

Mrs Loots has lymphostatic elephantiasis, a condition that has made her legs swell to almost triple their normal size (see right).

Symptoms of the disease may include severe fatigue, a heavy swollen limb or fluid accumulation in other body areas, discoloration of the skin overlying the lymphedema, and eventually deformity.

Lymphostatic elephantiasis is an extreme form of lymphoedema - a swelling in a limb as a result of damage to the lymphatic system, the body’s waste disposal system.

The lymphatic system plays an important role in the immune system, removing bacteria and waste from the tissues through a fine network of vessels carrying a fluid known as lymph. This travels to the lymph nodes, where it is cleansed.

If the system is compromised - as can happen as a result of both cancer surgery (where the nodes are removed) or radiotherapy (which can create scar tissue that blocks the lymphatic channels) -  unfiltered lymph fluid becomes trapped and forms pools, causing swelling.

Up to 250,000 people in the UK suffer from lymphoedema and key triggers for the devastating and often disfiguring condition are surgery and radiotherapy where lymph nodes are removed or damaged, particularly in breast, prostate and gynaecological cancers.

However, it is thought that Mrs Loots developed condition from a mosquito bite. There is another form of lymphoedema called Filariasis, which affects as many as 200 million people worldwide (primarily in the areas such as Africa, where she lives, and southeast Asia).

When the larvae from a mosquito bite enters the lymphatic system, they mature into adult worms in the lymphatic channels, causing severe lymphedema in the arms, legs and genitalia - also known as Elephantiasis.

She said: 'What I've been through is nothing short of a miracle.

'I was introduced to a dietician called Christo Strydam who created a diet especially for people like me. In the first month on my diet I lost a stone and a half.

'Taking my first steps in five years was very emotional.'

Sophia says doctors eventually diagnosed her with lymphedema, which can be brought on by mosquito bites.

Sophia was also suffering from emotional distress at the time after losing her father and having a stillborn child and this could have contributed to the collapse of her lymphatic system.
