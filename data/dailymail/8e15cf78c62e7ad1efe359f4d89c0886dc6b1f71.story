A bomb threat seemingly targeting the president of Sony Online Entertainment forced an American Airlines flight from Dallas to San Diego to divert its path to Phoenix Sunday.

The threat was posted to Twitter and specifically called out Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley.

'@AmericanAir We have been receiving reports that @j_smedley's plane #362 from DFW to SAN has explosives on-board, please look into this,' read the tweet from hacker 'Lizard Squad.'

The threat came after the Sony Playstation Network service was taken down by 'an attempt to overwhelm our network with artificially high traffic,' the company said.

The Dallas Morning News reports 'Lizard Squad' - which could be a single person or a collective - took credit for the hack.

Sony maintains no personal data was compromised.

Smedley later wrote on Twitter that his flight had been diverted but he did not comment on the bomb threat.

The tweet from hacker Lizard Squad was sent shortly after the person or group claimed credit for an attack on Sony's Playstation Network

An image of an e-Ticket for his flight along with the confirmation number was also posted to Twitter, and taken down, asking Smedley if it was a ticket for his flight.

Fox 5 San Diego reports that the FBI is now investigating the tweet.

Operations at San Diego's Lindbergh Field were normal as of 4:45 p.m., said Rebecca Bloomfield of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority.
