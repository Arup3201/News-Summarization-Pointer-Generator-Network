A schoolteacher who was killed in a light plane crash took to Facebook to pay a touching tribute to her husband, who was piloting the plane at the time of the crash, just days before she died.

Caro Harding, 47, posted a photograph taken at the couple's wedding with the caption: '25 years ago I married the love of my life you are my everything and always will be.'

The Inverell Public School kindergarten teacher was travelling in a light plane to Brisbane for a family holiday on Friday along with her 13-year-old daughter and her husband, Dr Mark Harding, 52, who was piloting the plane.

The Cessna 210 aircraft came down in Clive State Forest not long after takeoff and while all three escaped the wreckage, the plane then burst into flames and Mr and Mrs Harding received severe burns.

The family were initially taken to Inverell Hospital but Mr and Mrs Harding were later flown to Toyal North Shore hospital in Sydney.

Mrs Harding had sustained burns to 70 percent of her body and died in hospital on Saturday morning.

Dr Harding remains in a critical condition and the couple's daughter suffered burns to her legs.

Inverell mayor Paul Harmon, said the entire community was grieving over the well-respected teacher.

'She was a valued member of the school staff, you know, having an impact on lots of young people's lives," he told the Seven Network. 'She certainly is going to be missed. It's very sad.'

Witnesses reported hearing the plane's engine cough and splutter before it crashed just short of the runway.

'I was driving home and we saw something, it was like a pebble skipping across the water ... and then it came to a standstill,' witness Jade Olds told the Illwarra Mercury.

'There was a man who just stopped dead in the road and then he just ripped his shirt off and pulled people out of the plane.

'I just saw them getting taken out of the plane – it didn't look pretty ... and then the plane just went ka-boom and there was fire everywhere.'

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating and police are preparing a report for the coroner.

The plane began experiencing problems soon after take off, it burst into flames soon after crashing
