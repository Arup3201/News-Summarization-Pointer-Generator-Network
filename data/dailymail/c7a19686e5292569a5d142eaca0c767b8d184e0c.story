Israel today unveiled evidence that shows the Islamist group Hamas stored and fired rockets from schools during the deadly Gaza conflict.

The country's military presented a series of damning photos, as well as a breakdown of the toll inflicted on the militant group, during a briefing at its headquarters in Tel Aviv.

The images showed how rocket launchers were hidden in graveyards and a school playground, while tunnels were used by militants to carry out and escape from the sites of attacks.

Officers also claimed Hamas had 16,000 operatives placed across region during the 50-day war, while the terror group Islamic Jihad had a further 6,000.

And they provided details of the ranges and number of rockets fired by both organisations.

The briefing aimed to explain the severity of the threat Israel faced and justify the country's heavy tank shelling and air strikes during the 50-day war - tactics that drew international criticism.

One set of photographs, laid out by a senior military officer, showed a school by day, its central
yard empty. By night, rockets appeared to be stockpiled in the
yard.

Meanwhile, at another school, a canopy, where a hole had been torn for
a rocket launching, was further frayed after a projectile was allegedly
fired from underneath.

'We're dealing with a carefully structured and in many cases
well trained terrorist force,' said the senior officer,
who spoke on condition that his name not be used.

'Hamas has at least 16,000 operatives organised into six
brigades across the Gaza Strip, each with its own commander,
while (Islamic Jihad) has a similar structure and a total of
around 6,000 operatives.'

The war, the longest Israel has fought since it withdrew
from the narrow coastal enclave in 2005, left more than 2,100
Palestinians, most of them civilians, dead, the Palestinian
health ministry said. Israel said 67 of its soldiers and six
civilians were killed.

After two failed attempts, an open-ended ceasefire was
struck by Egyptian mediators on Aug. 26. Detailed talks on a
longer-term peace are supposed to start in the coming weeks,
although already there are doubts about their prospects.

On the day before the war began, the IDF said it estimated
militants held 10,000 rockets in Gaza, including 350-400 with a
range of up to 50 miles)and a few dozen with a range of 100 miles, reaching Jerusalem.

On top of that, the intelligence
officer said, there were 'thousands upon thousands' of mortars.

Around 4,000 rockets were fired during the conflict and
3,000 destroyed by Israel's operations, leaving between 2,500
and 3,000 in the hands of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups.

The officer described that as a 'major degradation' of the 
groups' capabilities, alongside the destruction of 32 tunnels
built from Gaza into Israel and steps to hit Hamas's finances.

He presented figures showing that civilians made up the
majority of those killed in the conflict, saying that of 2,127
Palestinian deaths so far verified by Israel, 706 were 
civilians and 616 militants.

A further 805 are listed as 'unknown', but the officer said
once verification was complete it was likely 40-45 percent of
them would be found to be militants and the remainder civilians.

He said the heavy civilian death toll was the result of
Hamas and others conducting operations from densely populated
areas or employing 'operatives' who may not have had a direct
militant affiliation but still participated in some way.

During the war, at least 6 U.N.-run schools were hit by
Israeli artillery, killing at least two dozen people and drawing
heavy criticism of Israel. Militant rockets were also found in
three empty U.N. schools.

The pictures shown by the Israeli officer were of other,
non-U.N. schools.

'We're a moral military. We want to learn from our
mistakes,' said the officer, adding that civilian casualties were 'a big
issue in the world' and one that Israel was keen to address.

With the war over, various investigations are set to begin,
including an internal Israeli military one, another by Israel's
government watchdog and a third by the UN's human rights
commission, already criticised in Israel.

While the officer, occasionally sipping tea from a U.S.
Defense Intelligence Agency cup, said Hamas had not managed to
surprise Israel during the war, he acknowledged that an attack
by commandos who swam from Gaza into Israel was well planned,
used advanced, Western equipment and was carried out by
militants who were 'in very good shape'.

Other near surprises were the extent of the tunnel network
dug by Hamas and its attempt to use a small drone-like plane,
although it carried no weapons or explosives.

Reconstituting those capabilities would take time, he said,
adding that this war had been more successful than previous ones
in 2012, 2008-9 and 2006 in knocking Hamas backwards.

But he
still referred to 'the next escalation' with Hamas, seeming to
accept that another conflict in Gaza was all but inevitable.
