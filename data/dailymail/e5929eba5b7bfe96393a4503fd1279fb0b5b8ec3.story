With Britain's economic recovery fast outstripping the rest of Europe, we may like to think of ourselves as a well-off nation.

But new data shows that, when compared to American states, Britain would actually rank as the second poorest if we were to join the US tomorrow.

Based on GDP per capita - the amount of wealth this country generates each year divided between everyone who lives here - the UK would rank below Alabama and just above Mississippi.

New data  shows that if the UK were to join the US it would rank as the second poorest state by GDP, behind Alabama and in front of Mississippi. It would also languish behind Germany, the poorest EU country

However the data, produced for The Spectator, also showed that without London the UK would rank far below even the most deprived state in the US.

When all the wealth generated in Britain each year is divided out equally among the population, it comes to just $36,202 each, compared to Alabama at $36,356 and Mississippi on $35,157.

All three are behind Missouri, where riots have been taking place, on $45,721, and far removed from the most well-off state, Alaska, which generates $80,741 dollars per person per year.

Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator, said: 'If Britain were to somehow leave the European Union and become the 51st state of America, we would actually be one of the poor states.

'If you take our economic output, adjust for living costs and slot it into the US league table then the United Kingdom emerges as the second-poorest state in the union.

Without London, which accounts for roughly 22 per cent of the UK's GDP, this country would come in last place with $10,000 per person per year less than Mississippi

'We’re poorer than much-maligned Kansas and Alabama and well below Missouri, the scene of all the unrest in recent weeks.'

The Mirror also calculated that without London, which accounts for around 22 per cent of the UK's GDP, we would have a GDP per capita of $25,224 - almost $10,000 per year worse off than Mississippi.

The figures were also adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, meaning researchers took into account how much you can buy for your money in each country, ensuring the fairest result.
