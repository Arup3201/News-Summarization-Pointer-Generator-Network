This grand 18th century estate, which comes with eight bedrooms, five bathrooms and stables, has gone on the market for £1million - less than some flats in central London.

Newsham Grange, a Grade-II listed manor near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was built in 1705 and is set in 16-acre grounds.

The Queen Anne country house, which looks like something out of a period drama, is just a two-hour train from the capital - but is available for less than some far smaller London flats.

Newsham Grange, an 18th century eight-bedroom, five-bathroom estate near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was built in 1705 and is set in 16-acre grounds

The Queen Anne country house is just a two-hour train from the capital - but is available for less than some far smaller flats in the most sought-after parts of London

Something out of Downton: The kitchen, complete with an AGA cooker, looks like something from a period drama - apart from the inconspicuous microwave

The estate is expected to sell for around £1million at auction later this month - which is less than some two-bedroom flat in the most desirable parts of the capital

The magnificent house, owned by semi-retired financial consultant Rob Edenbrow, 65, and his wife, Lesley, 55, comes with  views of the North Yorkshire countryside

Owner of the magnificent house Rob Edenbrow, a 65-year-old semi-retired financial consultant, has lived in the house with wife Lesley, 55, and daughter Ellen, 19, for the past 15 years. 

However, due to Mr Edenbrow's poor health, the family have decided to downsize from their country home, which has a long private drive and comes complete with equestrian facilities, to an apartment.

The entire contents of the estate are expected to sell for around £1million at auction - which is less than a posh one/two-bedroom flat in the most desirable parts of London. 

Mr Edenbrow, who grew up in a council house in Scunthorpe, said: 'We turned it from a livery into a family house for ourselves. We wanted the open space and I can see 22 miles to the hills but I am only three miles from the station.

'It is just over two hours to London Kings Cross and a neighbour actually commutes to London. When you look at this compared to a one-bed flat in London it is almost silly.

'It is not remote, but you have plenty of space. The main house has only got three bedrooms but they are massive and there is a two-bedroom guest house and three-bedroom barn conversion.

'There is also office space, equestrian facilities and 14 stables, although we have never kept any horses here.

'We wanted a project and we got one. We have been very fortunate to live here and have really enjoyed our time. It is absolutely beautiful around here and would suit anybody.

'It would be perfect for a family who still have their parents around, or someone looking for an extra income from holiday lets.' 

The Edenbrows, who have lived in the grand house with their 19-year-old daughter, Ellen, are selling up because of a decline in Mr Edenbrow's health

The main house has only got three bedrooms, but the estate comes with another two-bedroom guest house and a three-bedroom barn conversion

The £1million asking price buys the manor, converted barn, guest house, stables, 16 acres of land and planning permission for two further cottages

Mr Edenbrow said the estate would be 'perfect for a family who still have their parents around, or someone looking for an extra income from holiday lets'

The mini estate will go under the hammer in three weeks' time with Hunters Auction House, which is holding what will be a hotly-contested auction at York Racecourse

John Waterhouse, Hunters director and auctioneer, said buyers coming from London would be 'surprised to see what their money can get them'

Newsham Grange boasts the main house, which has 2,532 sq/ft of accommodation, the three bed barn conversion and two bed granary.

In total, there are eight bedrooms, five bathrooms and planning permission for a further two bedrooms with en suites in the main house.

The mini estate will go under the hammer on September 24 with Hunters Auction House, which is holding the sale at York Racecourse.

John Waterhouse, Hunters director and auctioneer, said: 'Newsham Grange is a rare country estate located in one of the most sought after areas of Yorkshire.

'The estate provides the ideal opportunity for a buyer looking to leave the hustle and bustle of city life to escape to the country.

'In doing so, many buyers coming from London will be surprised to see what their money can get them. It is outstanding that this country pile is available at the same price as a two bedroom flat in prime central London.

'What's more, the estate also has the potential for income with its two additional properties and planning consent for an additional holiday cottage.'

Owners Mr and Mrs Edenbrow are planning to downsize to a much smaller apartment, but say they thoroughly enjoyed living in their very own manor house

The converted barn on the 18th-century Newsham Grange has a side entrance which branches off the estate's long, gravel driveway - keeping it secluded from the road

The estate is an 'ideal opportunity for a buyer looking to leave the hustle and bustle' of inner-city life, the auctioneers say, but is still just three-miles from a train station

The Edenbrow's home is expected to sell for up to £1.2million.

For that money in the most sought-after areas of London, buyers could snap up a two-bedroom flat, such as the ones below.

1) This luxury two-bed flat in Hampstead, north-west London, has a spacious open-plan living room, and is on the market for £1million.

The large living room, brightly lit up by a large window, is perfect for a young family.

 

2) This two-bed flat, which lies right next to Regent's Park and is around 100 yards from Baker Street underground station, will set a buyer back £1,149,950.

The wooden-floored apartment, which has two bathrooms, is just a short walk from Oxford Street.

Its kitchen has a marble worktop and fashionable converted fireplace.  

3) A flat in this building in trendy Swiss Cottage, in Camden, will set you back £1million.

It has two large bathrooms and double bedrooms, and is wooden-floored throughout and has a feature gas fireplace.

Its lounge, easily large enough for a family, fits two sofas as well as a large dining table.

4) One flat in this red brick block is on the market for £1million, but it does come with an underground parking space and a porter.

The home, on Finchley Road, near Swiss Cottage, has three balconies over the seventh and eighth floor. 

While the building itself looks nothing special, the wooden interior and prime location push up its asking price.
