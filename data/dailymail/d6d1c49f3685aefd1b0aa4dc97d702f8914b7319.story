Mail Online is the most shared British media outlet on Facebook, according to figures published this week.

The award-winning website has an average of 624,278 shares a month on the social networking site, and accounts for up to 40 per cent of news stories.

The data, compiled by trend-tracking site Rippla, was gleaned from a survey of 150,000 articles from ten news outlets - dailymail.co.uk, BBC News, Guardian, Telegraph, Independent, Channel 4 News, FT.com, Evening Standard, Reuters UK and Sky News.

Over a six-month period, between November last year and this May, Mail Online - the world's biggest newspaper website - had an average Facebook share of 35.8 per cent.

This was followed by the BBC, with 29.6 per cent and the Guardian with 23.3 per cent.

The study also showed that the Daily Mail website publishes the most stories of the ten outlets but came fourth for tweets, averaging 103,545 a month, after the BBC, Guardian and Telegraph.

And the top three news sources -
 Mail Online, BBC News and the Guardian - together had six times more 
social media links than the rest combined.

Sunny Hundal, founder of Rippla, told journalism.co.uk: 'Social media now accounts for a huge
 proportion of links to news sites, from almost nothing just a few years
 ago.

'It's interesting to see how this 
affects journalism, as news outlets try and do stories that get shared 
around, but also to see who does it best and how.'

Hundal added that Mail Online - with is mix of hard-hitting news, celebrity gossip, human interest and quirky stories, combined with a focus on pictures -  lent itself well to sharing on Facebook.

The march of Mail Online

In March, the Daily Mail swept the board at the prestigious annual Press Awards – the Oscars of British journalism.

The Mail triumphed as both Newspaper of the Year and Website of the Year, in total taking an unprecedented nine accolades.

Coincidentally, the award for MailOnline came on the same day that it achieved a new landmark, overtaking the New York Times’ daily traffic for the first time, according to the respected independent web metrics company, Comscore.

In February, it recorded an average of 6,265,000 unique visitors a day, compared with the NYT’s 6,239,000

Mail Online previously overtook the NYT’s monthly traffic in December to become the world’s biggest newspaper website and remained ahead on that metric in February with 47,448,000 unique visitors.
