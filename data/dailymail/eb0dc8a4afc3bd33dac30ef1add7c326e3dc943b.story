Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck look money well spent for Arsenal but if Arsene Wenger had splashed the cash on a central defender they would have beaten Hull at a canter on Saturday.

Instead, Welbeck’s injury-time goal was only good enough for a point as Hull took full advantage of a makeshift Gunners defence to storm into a 2-1 lead after Sanchez’s brilliant opener.

Going forward, Arsenal were breathtaking at times, Sanchez in particular. But without Laurent Koscielny (Achilles tendon), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Calum Chambers (suspended), they were powder puff at the back.

Wenger has vowed to sign a central defender in January and the New Year cannot come soon enough for Arsenal fans.

The defensive crisis meant left-back Nacho Monreal filled in alongside Per Mertesacker at centre-back, while rookie right-back Hector Bellerin made his first league start for the club.

But when asked whether his side’s lack of defensive options cost his side, Wenger said: ‘Look at the two goals and tell me what you think? They had two shots in the game.

‘It was a disappointing afternoon. Their second goal was our fault, we came out after half-time without the defensive concentration.’

Hull manager Steve Bruce had his own problems. He was forced into a change prior to kick-off, Abel Hernandez replacing striker Nikica Jelavic, who picked up a knee injury during the warm-up.

Despite their injury problems, Arsenal could have been three-up inside the opening 10 minutes, Jack Wilshere, Welbeck and Santi Cazorla all going close.

The breakthrough came in the 13th minute and it was a touch of wizardry from Sanchez that unlocked the door, as his powerful shot beat Steve Harper after he had skipped beyond Curtis Davies.

It should have been the signal for a Saturday afternoon stroll but Momo Diame then ripped though the heart of Arsenal’s rearguard as Hull grabbed an unlikely leveller just four minutes later.

Picking up the ball in a similar spot to where Sanchez had started his run, Diame powered through before delicately chipping over goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.

Mathieu Flamini was fuming. He was adamant Diame had pulled him back in the build up. Looking at the replays, he was probably right, while Wenger and Bruce both said afterwards that Diame had fouled the midfielder.

Aaron Ramsey was a surprise substitute despite not taken part in full training after a hamstring problem

Former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas scored a fine goal for Chelsea against Crystal Palace 

The goal took the wind out of Arsenal’s sails but the injury problems kept coming for Bruce, as third-choice keeper Eldin Jakupovic replaced Harper, who suffered a torn bicep in the 42nd minute.

But those problems seemed a world away when Hernandez handed the visitors a shock lead quickly after the restart, as the Uruguayan rose above Mertesacker to head home Tom Huddlestone’s cross.

Wenger’s desperation was illustrated with 27 minutes left, as he brought on Aaron Ramsey — the man who scored the winner against Hull at Wembley last season in the FA Cup final.

Prior to kick-off, Wenger insisted Ramsey was not fit enough to be involved having only just recovered from a hamstring injury. But with his side needing a spark, Wenger played his trump card.

However, as the Gunners welcomed one midfielder back, they lost another as Wilshere limped off with an ankle injury, though Wenger confirmed he would be fit for Wednesday’s Champions League clash against Anderlecht.

The urgency in Arsenal’s game grew with Ramsey’s introduction. Cazorla was denied by some frantic last-ditch defending, before Michael Dawson stopped Sanchez with a heroic block in the 85th minute.

It proved the former Tottenham defender’s final contribution as he limped off with an ankle problem to add to Hull’s injury woes. Jakupovic then came to his side’s rescue, tipping over Sanchez’s header from Monreal’s cross but, in the first of six minutes of injury time, Arsenal snatched an equaliser.

Sanchez was again at the centre of it, showing brilliant skill to beat three Hull defenders before playing in Welbeck, who excellently finished past Jakupovic.
