The River Cam is world-famous for its civilsed punting and beautiful scenery, but staff policing the river now say they feel too afraid to work there without stab vests.

Officials in Cambridge have requested protection because of the growing hostility they face while on patrol.

The Cam Conservators group, who tackle illegal mooring and monitor river bylaws, made the proposal at their latest meeting.

Hostility: Staff patrolling the River Cam, famed for its punting, say they are now working in fear of attack

River bailiff Adrian Hoyes revealed that he feels so unsafe that he lives in fear of knife attacks.

The report said: 'The river bailiff has asked to be issued with a 'stab' vest given the increase in hostility displayed towards staff.'

City Councillor Kevin Price, a member of the Conservators group, said: 'It was felt that, in terms of a duty of care to staff and to protect them, it was better to be safe than sorry.

'It's a sign of a sad time when we have got to think about providing such equipment for a guy who is just doing a job.'

Tensions: Despite the idyllic scenery, there has been a worrying rise in antisocial behaviour on the river

Congestion: Part of the antisocial behaviour problem has been the intense rivalry of competing punting companies

Trouble at the busy tourist attraction in recent years has included heavy congestion, sunken punts, vandalism and a tense rivalry between punt operators.

Fears were also raised over the loutish behaviour of punters, such as urinating in public.

The meeting heard: 'A live-aboard boater complained a rowing eight came close to their vessel and one of the crew members stood up and urinated openly in front of them at breakfast time.

'The live-aboard owner tooted the boat horn at them in objection.

'The crew found this very amusing.'

River manager Dr Philippa Noon is concerned that there is growing frustration between motorised boats and Cambridge's famous rowers.

She said: 'A certain minority of powered craft owners take a bloody-minded attitude towards rowers, either failing to give way to them or not reducing their speed or wash when passing.'

A second report revealed a spate of boats deliberately being set free and house boats being burgled.

It not only humans that have proved troublesome on the river in recent years.

Last year Britainâ€™s most vicious swan, nicknamed Mr Asbo, was removed to a secret location to protect river users after a series of attacks on rowers and boaters.
