An Indiana Pizza Hut manager has been fired for refusing to open the restaurant on Thanksgiving because he didn’t think it was fair to his employees.

Tony Rohr says he thinks it is morally wrong to make people work on the holiday.

Rohr, who worked at the Jackson Boulevard Pizza Hut in Elkhart for 10 years, was fired after taking a stand at a meeting with superiors who told him opening on Thanksgiving was mandatory.

Fired: Former Pizza Hut general manager, Tony Rohr, was let go after refusing to open the restaurant for Thanksgiving

Long-time employee: Rohr, who started as a cook and worked his way up to being a general manager over the past 10 years at this Pizza Hut in Elkhart, was fired for refusing to make his employees work on Thanksgiving

He had started as a cook and worked his way up to being a general manager.

‘I said, "why can't we be the company that stands up and says we care about our employees and they can have the day off?",’ he told WSBT22.

He said he would not open the restaurant he managed on Thanksgiving.

‘Thanksgiving and Christmas are the only two days that they're closed in the whole year and they're the only two days that those people are guaranteed to have off and spend it with their families.’

But his goodwill cost him his job as he was told to sign a letter of resignation.

Rohr said he did not want to quit, but instead wrote a letter explaining his position to his boss.

Forced to quit: Rohr said he was told to sign a letter of resignation, which he refused to do

Letter: Instead, he wrote a letter explaining his position to his boss, saying the decision by the company to stay open on Thanksgiving was 'greedy' and 'immoral'

‘I am not quitting. I do not resign however I accept that the refusal to comply with this greedy, immoral request means the end of my tenure with this company.

‘I hope you realize that it's the people at the bottom of the totem pole that make your life possible.’

Rohr, who is now unemployed and looking for a new job, says it was worth it.

‘They're still going to be open. I'm sure they're still going to sell pizza but I just didn't think it was right.’

However, according to the direction of operations for Pizza Hut in Indiana and Illinois, Rohr resigned from the job and was not fired.

He told WSBT22 that opening on Thanksgiving was not an individual's decision, but a company decision.
