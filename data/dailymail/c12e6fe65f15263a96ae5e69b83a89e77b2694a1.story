Blonde bombshell Kate Upton is the unlikely cover star of Golf Digest's December issue.

The 21-year-old, not known for her putting skills, appears casually leant against golfing legend Arnold Palmer on the front of the glossy with her ample cleavage covered in an orange polo dress.

An editorial inside the magazine shows her getting a golf lesson from Mr Palmer, 84, who explains that 'the way she waggled the club was very easy and natural.'
