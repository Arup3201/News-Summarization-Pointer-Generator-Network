An 89-year-old Washington State shop owner fearlessly used a golf club to fend off a robber who entered her store Sunday morning armed with a 3-foot samurai sword.

Miyo Koba had never faced a robber in her 60 years as owner of Frank's Market in Moses Lake, but handled her first such encounter like a seasoned pro, at least after she ruled out stabbing the man.

Before the 5 wood club, Koba tried threatening him with a sharp pair of scissors.

Not having it: 89-year-old Moses Lake, Washington shop owner Miyo Koba stands in her store holding the 5 wood golf club she used to fend off a samurai sword wielding attacker who robbed her store on Sunday morning

Brave: The attacker came in demanding Miyo open the register. She refused and says she was emboldened by the false belief her attacker's 3-foot sword was just a toy

'I had the scissors in my hand like this,' she said as she demonstrated her threatening stance to KREM.

She said the robber demanded she open the register and that he at some point knocked her down.

'I didn't have the nerve to stab him,' admitted Koba, who nonetheless was under the false impression his sword was just a toy.

'I didn't feel threatened.Â  It just probably made me a little bit more brave,' she told KREM.

While on the floor, the plucky lady snatched a nearby golf club and started swinging.

Sharp lady: Koba first grabbed a pair of scissors, which she brandished at the robber but was hesitant to stab him. Instead, she grabbed a golf club--but not before he pushed her to the ground

Thwomp! Koba first swung at the robber's head, but missed. So she whacked him in the legs before he ran off with her cash register

'I got into a sitting position and I found the club so I went tried to swing this club at him and I tried to hit his head a couple times but I couldn't reach it,' said Koba, who then went for his legs where she landed some blows.

The wounded robber managed to make it out of the store with the cash register, which was recovered later by police along with the robbers clothing and shoes.

Police say he was riding a BMX style bike as he fled.

'He must have been running around in his underwear and no shoes because that's what they said, they found all his clothes,' said Koba.

Thankfully, Koba was unharmed and had her register returned by police.
