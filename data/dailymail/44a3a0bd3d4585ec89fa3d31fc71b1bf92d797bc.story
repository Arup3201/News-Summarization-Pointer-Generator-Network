Animal testing for household products such as bleach, washing-up liquid and air fresheners could soon be banned.

Ministers yesterday took the first steps towards ending experiments on rabbits, mice and other laboratory animals.

Testing of cosmetics on animals has been illegal in Britain since 2008.

'Unacceptable': Testing on animals often causes illness or even death

Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said inflicting pain and suffering on animals to manufacture household products was ‘unacceptable’. The tests involve giving animals toxic doses of chemicals or  rubbing irritants into their skin.

Unacceptable: Lynne Featherstone said that testing on animals was wrong

The Government had previously said it wanted a ban, and yesterday announced it was consulting with companies, trade bodies and other interested parties to draw up a detailed proposal.

Mrs Featherstone said: ‘We believe it is possible to sell household products  without inflicting pain and suffering on  animals, and it is unacceptable that  testing in this area continues.

‘We propose to implement a ban through our licensing powers, and we are inviting stakeholders to share their views so we can end this practice as soon as possible.’

The move was given a guarded welcome by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) which has campaigned to end animal testing for cosmetics and household products.

Chief executive Michelle Thew said: ‘The BUAV welcomes the reaffirmation of the intention to ban testing on animals for house products, although we are concerned by the Government’s continued uncertainty about which products will be covered and the absence of a firm date to implement the ban.

‘It is unacceptable for animals to  continue to suffer and die for a new  washing-up liquid or air freshener.’

It is likely to be several months before the ban is brought in. The consultation will last 12 weeks.

More than 7,000 animals were used for testing of household products like air freshener between 1997 and 2006

The proposal is part of wider plans to reduce the use of animals in research – and switch to tests on laboratory grown cell cultures and computer modelling. If there are no alternatives, the Government wants to reduce suffering.

Last week the Home Office revealed that the number of animals used in scientific and medical experiments has gone up by one million in the past decade.

Most of the rise is caused by the creation of genetically modified mice and fish for medical research.
