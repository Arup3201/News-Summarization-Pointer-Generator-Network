An English landlord who produced a gun after a row with customers at his village pub in Wales when they ordered their drinks in Welsh has escaped jail.

Gareth James Sale, 26, had denied possessing a firearm - an air rifle - with intent to cause fear of violence at the Royal Oak, Penrhyndeudraeth in the early hours of June 18 last year, but admitted the lesser charge of possessing a firearm in a public place.

Caernarfon Crown Court heard the row started after Sales’ partner Sheridan Graham told customers to 'order their drinks in English.'

Under new management : The Royal Oak in Penrhyndeudraeth, where Gareth Sale threatened customers with an air rifle

Sale had drunk eight units of vodka and his partner 'significantly more' between 3pm and midnight that day.

Prosecutor Sitn Ap Mihangel said: 'She became very aggressive and it eventually culminated with the Welsh drinkers being told to leave.'

Sale went upstairs and returned with an air rifle - causing alarm to three customers who had remained in another bar - but he denied loading the gun or threatening anybody.

Witness Alys Owen, who was in another bar, said she saw Sale inserting a 'silver bullet' - an air cannister - in the gun and asked him: ‘Why have you got a gun?’ He said: "I just want to ******* scare them" - the people outside.'

Sentenced: Sales admitted the lesser charge of possessing a firearm in a public place, having previously denied the charges

Andrew Green who defended Sale, said 
the 6-8 locals who had been ejected began 'banging on the windows and 
kicking a door in a threatening and intimidating manner.'

He said Ms Graham was 'at the centre of the storm and rash behaviour which caused alarm to Miss Owen.'

Sentencing Sales to a 32-week suspended jail sentence, Judge Peter Heywood said: 'It would appear Miss Graham was struggling to understand customers who were ordering their drinks in their first language of Welsh.

'It seems that the matter was not handled sensitively and she (Ms Graham) introduced a house rule customers had to order in English.'

Judge Heywood did concede that Sale’s behaviour was out of character, but said 'You over-reacted. Anybody who produces a weapon in a pub clearly commits a serious offense.

'The use of weapons by somebody who was intoxicated in a charged atmosphere could have led to an injury or a loss of life.'

In addition to the 32-week suspended jail sentence, Sale was handed a 12-month supervision order; told to carry out 200 hours unpaid work and pay £250 court costs.

The Royal Oak is now under new management.

However, Sale, who split up with 
Ms Graham before he appeared in court, and had been removed from the pub by his employers Relief Managers Suppliers (RMS), has been given a second chance.

He now works at another RMS 
pub in the West Midlands.

injury or a loss of life.'
