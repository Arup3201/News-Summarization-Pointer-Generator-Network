When it comes to curd chewing, Tim Swokowski is the big cheese.

The Kaukauna man worked his way to world champion status by devouring half a pound of hefty cheese curds in record time at Saturday's Great Wisconsin Cheese Festival in Little Chute.

And the secret to downing the rubbery chunks in less than two minutes: 'I don't do a lot of chewing', the champion told postcrescent.com.

Cheese curds are the solid parts of 
soured milk, sometimes referred to as 'squeaky cheese' because they 
squeak against teeth when bitten.

They have a rubbery texture and can be difficult to eat on their own.

The competition saw Swokowski swallow the curds in just 1 minute, 46 seconds - smashing the former long-held 2 minutes, 7 seconds record.

The champion cheese eater was thrilled at achieving the fastest time in the festival's 25-year history.

'The cheese curd eating experience was great. I did it for my family. My kids are here watching,' he told postcrescent.com.

'I did it a few years ago and won. It's a lot harder than it looks.

'There are definitely some techniques
 to it. You definitely need the water because the cheese is harder to 
swallow than you think.

'I just swallow big chunks of cheese. I don't do a whole lot of chewing.'

Festival volunteer Joe Harlowe said organizers were inundated with contest participants.

'We have so many people who are interested. Out of all the participants that are volunteering, we pick nine contestants randomly,' the Appleton resident told postcrescent.com.

'The first one to finish their cheese curds gets the coveted Great Wisconsin Cheese Festival cheese curd eating contest medal.'
