It was the golden age of air travel, when using aeroplanes was still glamorous and comfortable.

Now, a set of vintage photographs has revealed both the luxury cabins and the primitive technology that was used.

The shots show passengers reclining in armchairs and eating delicious meals thousands of feet in the air.

Update: The idea of luxury has changed, with passengers favouring sleek white cabins

Plush cabins also provide a sharp contrast from the more sleek design used in air travel today.

The photographs were release by British Airways, who also recreated the shots in a modern setting.

A pilot sitting in a primitive cockpit is shown dressed in a uniform and pilot's cap and is compared with a modern aeroplane, featuring all the technology that is now used.

During the pioneering early days at Heathrow military tents were pressed into service in the summer of 1946 to provide basic facilities for passengers using the newly-opened airport.

In-flight meal: British Airways business class still gives customers a taste of luxury, but the style is very different now

The airport featured a cable office and a W. H. Smith for the 620 passengers that passed through its doors every week.

But now, British Airways alone carries an average of 650,000 customers per week through Heathrow Terminals 5, 3 and 1.

In 1927, Imperial Airways, a predecessor to British Airways, introduced its ‘Silver Wing’ service from London to Paris, with luxury features such as in-flight catering and a steward.

In  1958 a De Havilland DH106 Comet 4 jet airliner was delivered to BOAC, which later merged with BEA to form British Airways. 

On October 4 1958, BOAC operated the first ever-transatlantic passenger commercial services in the world between London and New York. 

55 years later, on July 4 2013, British Airways is taking delivery of the first UK operated Airbus A380 ‘Superjumbo’. 

The luxurious aircraft will carry 469 passengers at a maximum speed of 587mph and will initially serve Los Angeles and Hong Kong.

Aircraft: :A Bristol Britannia of BOAC at London Airport North.  BOAC's services moved progressively to Terminal 3 after it opened in 1961

While commercial air travel took place as early as 1911, aeroplanes were unstable, small and could not reach high altitudes.

But, in the interwar years, advances in technology saw stronger engines and better navigation, making flights safer for commercial passengers.

The development of cabin pressurization in the early 1920’s also made it more comfortable for passengers, allowing then to travel to high altitudes without noticing any change.

Post World War II light aircraft suitable for the mass market were developed, and thousands of trained pilots came out of military service.

The famous Boeing 707 then became the first jetliner to be commercially successful, providing a comfortable experience for those who wished to fly.

Air travel became more glamorous during the 1960s as while it was more affordable, it was still exclusive. Journeys were comfortable and plush, with food and drinks being served by stylish stewardesses.

Concorde was developed in 1969, by the UK and France, making the journey between London and New York even quicker, but was discontinued in 2003 following the aircraft’s only crash.

Now, with the introduction of budget airlines, millions of passengers enjoy travelling abroad with ease even though the style and mystique of mid-century air travel has disappeared.
