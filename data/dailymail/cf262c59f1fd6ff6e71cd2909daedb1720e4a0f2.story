Reeva Steenkamp's mother believes Oscar Pistorius 'would have killed someone sooner or later' and that her daughter's 'bad luck' conspired against her.

June Steenkamp insists that the Paralympian was destined to kill and his character traits made that clear.

In a high-profile trial lasting six months in his native South Africa, Pistorius was cleared of murdering his girlfriend but found guilty of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years in prison - as well as a concurrent three-year suspended incarceration for a previous reckless endangerment conviction. 

June Steenkamp, mother of Reeva, has claimed that Oscar Pistorius 'would have killed someone sooner or later', and that her daughter's 'bad luck' meant it was her

In an interview with The Times Magazine on Saturday, which is serialising her soon-to-be-released book Reeva: a Mother's Story, June Steenkamp explained: 'It was Reeva's bad luck that she met him, because sooner or later he would have killed someone. I do believe that.'

Miss Steenkamp's mother also describes Pistorius as: 'moody', 'volatile', 'arrogant', 'combustible', as well as 'trigger-happy', 'possessive', 'gun-toting', 'vague', 'shifty' and 'evasive'.

And she struggles to believe that shooting someone on multiple occasions can be classed as accidental. 

When asked about whether or not Pistorius was culpable for her daughter's death, she replied: 'What? (Shooting someone) four times an accident?'

And her daughter's death haunts her at night - she even regularly wakes up at around 3am, the time Reeva died at Pistorius' home.

Interestingly though, neither June Steenkamp nor her husband, Barry, have met Pistorius before - despite having received 6,000 rand (£340) a month from the athlete dubbed 'Blade Runner' since March 2013.

Neither parent would know what to say should they eventually meet, however. 'I am not entirely sure what I am going to say. I know how I fell, but its in my head and it must stay there until that time that we meet.'

The Steenkamps and their lawyer, Dup de Bruyn, are also adamant that the money they have received from Pistorius is ethically sound.

In fact, June Steenkamp believes Reeva would have wanted them to survive from the royalties of such things as the book and also the interviews both parents have done with various news outlets.

She continued: 'I think she would have wanted us to have some money. Imagine going through this and you are having no money for anything. Imagine going through the trauma, suffering, pain and having no money.'
