Thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer could be denied a new drug by the NHS rationing body.

Radium-223 extends life by nearly four months and improves quality of life for men whose cancer has spread to the bones.

In
 the latest blow to men with prostate cancer, the National Institute for
 Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has issued a draft decision not to recommend its use on the NHS in England and 
Wales.

The drug Radium-223 or Xofigo extends life by up to four months. A full course of the drug costs £24,000 but Bayer has agreed an NHS discount

Nice says Bayer, the manufacturer of Radium-223, has not 
supplied data comparing it with another drug regime so cannot judge 
whether it is cost-effective.

But charities and cancer specialists 
are outraged, saying it could take years for this ‘innovative’ agent to 
be tested against other new drugs and it is a ‘kick in the teeth’ for 
men who have run out of options.

Around 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments.

Nice
 is also considering curbs on enzalutamide, which extends life by five 
months, with some men living for 18 months.

Radium-223 is an internal radiotherapy treatment for
 prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and is not responding to 
hormone therapy.

Sir Andrew Dillon, Nice's chief executive said the organisation needed to be confident that the benefits would justify the cost

The monthly injection has been shown to extend 
survival by an average of 3.6 months and delays the cancer getting into 
the bones by 5.5 months.

Because radium-223 is similar to calcium, it
 is taken up by active bone cells and is therefore an effective way of 
zapping bone cancer cells and raising quality of life with minimal side 
effects.

A course of treatment costs £24,000, although Bayer has 
agreed an NHS discount with the Department of Health, which is 
confidential.

In the US, the drug also known as Xofigo was fast-tracked for approval last year because no alternative therapy was available.

But
 Nice says it was not possible to determine whether it could be 
considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources, because comparison 
data with the cancer drugs docetaxel and abiraterone had not been 
presented by Bayer.

Leading prostate cancer specialist Professor 
Jonathan Waxman said Nice was imposing virtually impossible conditions 
on the drug’s use despite accepting that it works.

He said ‘Doing trials 
to produce this data could bring delays of four, five or more years when
 some men could be benefiting right now.

‘The FDA in the US is an 
enlightened organisation that reached a rapid opinion which recognised 
the need for men to have access to this drug if the cancer had gone to 
their bones.

‘We need to cut back the power of Nice, this has been promised but nothing seems to happen.‘If this was a drug to treat breast cancer there would be an outcry’ he added.

Mikis
 Euripides, director of policy and strategy at Prostate Cancer UK said 
‘It’ s a terrible kick in the teeth for men facing their last months, 
especially as other new treatments, such as enzalutamide, have 
restrictions on use in England and Wales.

‘Unless the drug company provides the necessary evidence, men will be denied this safe and effective drug.

‘We
 urge Bayer to submit everything required in the coming weeks before 
NICE takes its final decision on this valuable treatment.

Leading prostate cancer specialist Professor Jonathan Waxman said Nice was imposing virtually impossible conditions on the drug's use despite accepting that it works

‘Men dying 
of prostate cancer have so few options and to lose one that has already 
been developed and is known to be effective is madness.’

Sir Andrew 
Dillon, NICE Chief Executive, said ‘Bone metastases are very distressing
 for patients and their families, particularly as a result of bone pain 
and fatigue, which have a profound effect on patients’ quality of life, 
by limiting their mobility and meaning full-time care would often be 
needed for daily activities.

‘We know how important this could be to 
patients and we are disappointed not to able to recommend this drug, but
 we have to be confident that its benefits justify its considerable 
cost.’

A Bayer spokesman said Xofigo was the first drug of its type 
developed to treat advanced prostate cancer.

He said it was trying 
‘to develop a new economic model using a measure of progression 
appropriate to the innovative nature of Xofigo’ and would continue to 
work with Nice.

The Scottish Medicine Consortium (SMC) has yet to consider the drug for use in Scotland
