A Utah woman whose two-year-old son died after police say she inadvertently poured her methadone from a Gatorade bottle into his sippy cup will serve up to 15 years in prison.

Judge Robert Adkins said Tuesday in a Tooele courtroom that he disagreed with prosecutors who said the 33-year-old Jill Goff shouldn't serve prison time.

She was sentenced on Tuesday to prison 
for up to 15 years despite recommendations for leniency from the 
prosecutor and defense attorney.

Tragic: Aiden Goff, right, has died after his mother Jill Goff, left, accidentally served him methadone

Goff pleaded guilty in June to a child abuse homicide charge in the death of Aiden Goff, who was found dead February 1st after drinking a pink liquid.

Court documents say Goff realized she had served her son the wrong drink when her 8-year-old son tried it and said it tasted like medicine.

She told police she didn't call 911 or poison control right away because she was scared.

'These are probably the most 
troubling cases for me,' said Judge Robert Adkins. '… It doesn’t appear 
you intentionally gave methadone to your children.'

Loss: Aiden drank from the cup his mother gave him on Friday afternoon. She was unaware that she had given him liquid methadone, which was being stored in a pink Gatorade bottle

Mother and son: Two of her other children also tasted the liquid but they survived after treatment. After realizing her mistake, Jill Goff put Aiden down for a nap but he did not wake up

Adkins, nevertheless, imposed the maximum punishment of one to 15 years at the Utah State Prison.

Defense
 attorney Jacob Linares had asked for jail, not prison, saying: "This is
 a horrific, tragic accident that she suffered, as well as the rest of 
the family.

'Had she known 
for sure what was happening, she would have done whatever she could to 
change the outcome,' Linares told the judge.

Prosecutor Gary Searle agreed that prison wasn’t the place for Goff.

She 'refused to give her child a fighting chance,' Searle said, but didn’t kill him on purpose.

'It’s not going to bring her child back,' he said. 'It’s not going to serve any purpose … but satisfy the lust for vengeance.'

Aiden Goff died after his mother accidentally gave him liquid methadone that she 
stored in a Gatorade bottle.

Methadone
 is a pain reliever that can 
also be used to help recovering addicts through withdrawal symptoms and 
its side effects can mimic 
heroine.

Mix up: She served him pink liquid methadone 
(left) - a strong pain killer that has similar side effects to heroin - 
that had been stored in a Gatorade bottle (right). It is not clear why 
the drug was stored in the bottle

Scene: Goff went for a nap with Aiden at the home, pictured, and later found him unresponsive

Police believe she obtained the drug legally but they have not 
said why it was in liquid form or stored in a drink bottle.

The 
hospitalized children told relatives and detectives that their mother 
had given Aiden a drink but he did not like it, the probably cause 
statement said.

When he complained that he did not 
like it, the mother gave it to the five-year-old, who agreed it was 
disgusting. The eight-year-old then tasted it and he said it tasted like
 medicine.

Investigators believe that, rather than serving her child Gatorade, she inadvertently
 gave him methadone, which had been stored in the Gatorade bottle, 
Wimmer said.

The mother then
 realized that she had switched the liquids and tried to get her 
two-year-old son to throw up, the statement said. She then gave him a 
bath and put him down for a nap.

She told investigators that she did not call police because she was scared.

A 14-year-old sibling went to wake Aiden, but he wasn't responsive. Goff called 911.
