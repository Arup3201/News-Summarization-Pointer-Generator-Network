The Dean of York has been forced to drag the police into the row over where the remains of Richard III should be buried after receiving a torrent of hate mail, an MP has claimed.

The Very Revd Vivienne Faull, until 
recently the Dean of Leicester, has been the target of a string of abusive letters as the debate over the hunchback king's final resting place rages on.

In what was one of the most extraordinary finds archeological in history, his bones were unearthed last year under a council car park in Leicester by archaeologists from the city's university.

Under the terms of their licence to 
dig up the remains, the university's scientists have decided Richard III
- killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 - should be re-interred at 
Leicester Cathedral.

But other experts argue that the king 
himself would have wanted to be put to rest at York Minster and that the
remains should be moved to the city.

Labour MP Hugh Bayley said while the debate appeared good natured at first, it has now taken a more sinister turn after the Dean of York received such abusive letters she had to pass them to the police.

Calls: Labour MP Hugh Bayley said while the debate appeared good natured at first, it has now taken a more sinister turn

He has now called on the government to set up an independent panel of experts to make a decision once and for all.

Speaking during a debate in Westminster Hall, he said: 'I received many letters and emails from members of the public about this, supporting burial in York.

'Most are thoughtful and well argued and based on scientific facts but some are frankly inflammatory and talking yesterday to the Dean of York, some that she has received at the minster are so extreme that she has referred the correspondence to the police.

'I would say to everybody: calm down. Let's all respect the memory of a former king of our country. Let's discuss where his remains should be put to rest in a dignified and sober way. We don't want to reignite the Wars of the Roses.'

Nine of the monarch's descendants have called on the Government to return the remains of the king to York for a 'formal and ceremonial' burial, while a petition calling for his remains to be transferred to the northern city has been signed by more than 23,000 people.

Mr Bayley said: 'The decision should be taken on independent national advice and not delegated to archaeologists from Leicester who clearly support the Leicester cause.

'They would find it outrageous if the decision was delegated to people from York. We need the decision to be taken nationally, in the national interest by people who are independent of the vested interests of either York or Leicester.'

But Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said York Minster itself supported the re-interment of the remains at Leicester Cathedral.

He said the decision was up to the University of Leicester, under the terms of its licence.

He told MPs that, before the archaeologists started digging, they thought it was 'unlikely' they would find the remains of the king.

Mr Wright said: 'Now that the exhumation has been completed, it is the University of Leicester's responsibility as holder of the licence to decide where King Richard III remains are finally laid to rest. That is the law.

'Much has been made, not least today, of the fact that the people of York want the remains to be buried in York and I do understand the strength of feeling in York and Yorkshire more widely.

'However, I should make it clear that York Minster has openly supported the re-interment of Richard III's remains in Leicester Cathedral.

'It is also right I think to point out that the default position of the Church of England... is that the remains should be interred at the nearest Christian church and that of course is in this case indeed Leicester Cathedral.'

Grisly death: Richard (on white horse) died at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. He was stripped naked with his hands tied, and scarred by multiple 'humiliation wounds' inflicted as his body was paraded through Leicester, Richard III was dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud

The discovery of Richard III's skeleton in a Leicester car park was formally announced early in February this year to much fanfare and cheers.

It was, scientists said, a historic moment, finally ending the centuries-old 
mystery of what happened to the body of the last Plantagenet king.

Academics were also able to reveal details of 
how one of the nation’s most controversial monarchs met his end – and 
how appallingly he was treated in death after defeat at the hands of 
Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

Stripped naked with his hands tied, and scarred by multiple ‘humiliation wounds’ inflicted as his body was paraded through Leicester, Richard III was dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud.

There his body remained until his skeleton was discovered last year following a campaign led by Phillipa Langley, of the Richard III Society.

Using historical maps, archaeologists had traced a friary where the king was rumoured to have been buried, which now lies beneath a social services department car park in Leicester.

Screenwriter Miss Langley described the chill she felt when walking through the car park in August 2009: ‘It was a hot summer and I had goosebumps so badly and I was freezing cold.

'I walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew I was walking on his grave.’
