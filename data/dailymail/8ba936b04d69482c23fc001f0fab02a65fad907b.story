The sister of British journalist John Cantlie, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants, tonight urged the terror group to 'restart dialogue' with his family.

In an emotional appeal, Jessica Cantlie said that the family had  been in contact with the terrorists,  but that recent messages have been ignored.

Ms Cantlie said it was 'frustrating' that their line of communication had been cut off and 'strongly' challenged the group to return to 'their previously opened channel'.

'Frustrating': Tonight Jessica Cantlie urged the Islamic State to 'restart dialogue' with the family

Captive: Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including The Sunday Times, has featured in several propaganda videos released by the Islamic extremists

She added that her family was awaiting a response.

In the video that was released on Monday night, Ms Cantlie said that she was speaking 'on behalf of the head of the Cantlie family,' referring to her father Paul who is terminally ill. 

Her brother, a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including The Sunday Times, was kidnapped in Syria two years ago. 

In recent weeks the 43-year-old captive has featured in a number of propaganda videos released by the Islamic extremists and apparently wrote an article for the group's Dabiq magazine. 

Referring to her brother's appearance in the videos and article, Ms Cantlie said his 'words are powerful and have huge resonance'. 

Speaking directly to camera, Ms Cantlie said: 'We, John's family, want to address Islamic State, who are holding him. 

'It is not true to say that there has been no attempt to engage with IS. It is simply not accurate.

'This is frustrating for all parties, including those who are trying to assist us. We had previously been in contact through a channel started by you, but then this stopped for reasons best known to you. 

Ignored: Ms Cantlie said that recent messages to the terrorist group through a 'previously opened channel' of communication had been ignored

'Sadly, like the families of David Haines and Alan Henning before they were killed, our efforts at re-opening dialogue continue to be ignored by those holding John.

'We strongly challenge those holding John to return to your previously opened channel, to which we continue to send messages and await your response so that in keeping with everyone's wishes, we can restart dialogue.

'We implore IS to reinitiate direct contact.' 

'Terminally ill': In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him

Earlier this month Mr Cantlie's sick father issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his son’s release. 

In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him.

He said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them.

Speaking about watching the original footage of his son, he said: ‘For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die.

‘As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness.’

Addressing his son’s captors, he said: ‘To those holding John: please know that he is a good man, he sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him.’

The parents of the captured American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, formerly known as Peter, also said they were trying to contact IS with messages and videos but did not know if it was working.

His mother Paula told CBS News: ‘I do not know if it is working but I have got to try because I need to know I’ve done everything I can do.’

The videos of Mr Cantlie, who is originally from Hampshire, have all followed the same format, with the journalist sitting at a desk against a black backdrop to address the camera.

There are no signs of violence in the videos but, in the first, Mr Cantlie made it clear he was speaking as a prisoner whose life was in danger. 

Appeal: In a statement released tonight, his sister Jessica Cantlie said it was 'frustrating' that contact with her family has stopped

The terrorists last night released a fourth propaganda video featuring the British hostage, in which he blamed the UK government for beheadings by jihadis in Syria.

In a video clip posted online, the abducted photojournalist told how the terror group 'eagerly awaited' a ground war with America and its allies. 

He also accuses western governments of spending millions of pounds on 'Hollywood-style' military action instead of paying ransoms to his captors.

In the chilling 6min 53sec film, Mr Cantlie said he expected to be executed, adding 'I await my turn.' In a further development, in a long article apparently written by Mr Cantlie for IS's Dabiq magazine, he insists he writes the scripts to the videos in which he appears.

In last night’s professionally-produced video, the captive – wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit – said a battle against the fanatics where no one ‘gets their hands dirty’ was impossible. 

So far, a 40-nation coalition led by the US and including Britain as well as Arab nations have carried out air strikes while ruling out combat troops.

Mr Cantlie, who appeared to be delivering the message under duress, added that the beheading videos were a ‘win-win’ for the militant group.

However, it appears the film was shot before the murder of Alan Henning. Delivering scripted lines, Mr Cantlie said the decapitation of ‘three previous cellmates’ by Islamic State fanatics had shocked the public.

But taxi driver Mr Henning was the fourth Western hostage to be executed, after US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.
