Investigators suspect a teenager may have murdered three of his family members at their Kentucky home before he was killed after a police chase around the Baltimore beltway in Maryland.

Officers attempted to stop the Honda Pilot being driven by Jason Hendrix on Interstate 95 on Saturday morning in central Maryland. 

After a high-speed pursuit ended in Essex, Marlyand, Jason allegedly shot and injured one officer, before being fatally wounded by return fire.

An officer who went to Jason's home in Corbin, Kentucky, after his death discovered three bodies.

Corbin Police Officer Steve Meadors went to the home of Kevin and Dr Sarah Hendrix to do a welfare check, the Corbin News Journal reported. 

He discovered their dead bodies and the body of their daughter Grace. 

All three had been shot. 

Two of the bodies were found in the kitchen and one was in a bedroom at the residence. 

Authorities continue to investigate, but they believe the three family members were killed last Wednesday.

Jason had not been been seen at Corbin High School since last Tuesday.

Kentucky police confirmed that Hendrix is suspected of killing his mother, father and sister, the Baltimore Sun reported. 

Detective William Rose of the Corbin Police Department said:  

'All indications look that way. Yes, he is a suspect.'

The teen was a member of his school's junior ROTC program.

The Baltimore County Police contacted officers in Corbin after Jason was killed. 

Investigators in both states are working together on the case.

'Baltimore County detectives are working with Corbin City law enforcement to determine the link between what happened in Kentucky and what happened in Baltimore County,' according to a press release. 

One of Jason Hendix's friends posted this photo on Facebook of him attending a military ball

A neighbor said Mr Hendrix was a beekeeper.

Mrs Hendrix was a professor at Union College in Barbourville, Kentucky.

In a Facebook post, the school wrote: 'The Union College community is heartbroken by the tragic deaths of Dr Sarah Hendrix, her husband Kevin, and their daughter Grace. 

We have lost a member of our family, a wonderful educator, colleague, and friend. 

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Hendrix family at this time.' 

A woman commenting on the News Journal's website about the story wrote: 'I didn't know Jason personally; however, my grandson did. 

'The boys just had their military ball and had so much fun! 

My grandson still has pics on his phone! 

'He was so upset and worried that he was one that was killed in his home, along with his family! 

'When we read later that he was the one who did all of this, he was devastated! 

'There is NO reason for anyone to do this, none!!! 

'My heart breaks for his only surviving sister and all of the loved ones left behind!! 

'We have prayed for all of them, including the parents, his little sister and Jason! Something had to be terribly wrong with him to create this grief and heartbreak!'

Neighbors say Mr Hendrix (above) kept bees and was always willing to help them with their bee problems 

Jason's Facebook says he worked at Playing Guitars, the Tri-County Cineplex and Forward Community Church

During the shootout in Maryland, Jason was armed with a handgun and other weapons. 

The officer he shot was treated at the the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center and released today. 

Mrs Hendrix was a professor at Union College in Barbourville, Kentucky. The school was 'heartbroken' to learn about her 'tragic' death, according to a Facebook post

Before his death, Jason worked at Playing Guitars, the Tri-County Cineplex and Forward Community Church, according to his Facebook page. 

Earlier today, one of Jason's friends posted a photo of them attending a military ball.

A female user wrote: 'Jason looked so…Jason-y! 

'Hehe he learned the funny faces from me…I miss him already.' 

Michelle Payne, a neighbor who lives across the street, said a police officer stopped by her home Saturday afternoon and asked if she had seen a green Honda Pilot.

She hadn't seen the family since Tuesday evening, when Mr Hendrix walked the family dog.

She said they were a nice family, attending a community church a short distance away.

'They're just your classic small-town family,' Payne said.

Six Baltimore County Police officers fired their weapons during Saturday's shootout. 

They will be placed on administrative status pending a review of the incident.
