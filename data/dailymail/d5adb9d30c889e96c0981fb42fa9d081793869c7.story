A full judicial inquiry may be needed to get to the bottom of claims British spies were complicit in the torture of terror suspects in CIA jails, Nick Clegg said today.

The Deputy Prime Minister said torture ‘cannot, will not and is not being used under any circumstances by British agencies' today.

But the publication of a damning report into CIA interrogation techniques yesterday has sparked accusations that the Blair Government was was operating a 'secret policy of complicity' after 9/11.

Former-shadow home secretary David Davis said the UK had 'turned a blind eye' to what America was doing.

He said this included 'allowing people initially under our control to be taken and subjected to torture'.

Controversy raged on both sides of the Atlantic as politicians absorbed the enormity of the report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which said the use of torture by the CIA was far worse than feared and a 'stain on the conscience' of the US.

Some 119 detainees were subjected to beatings, waterboarding, rectal feeding, being hung on chains and being made to wear nappies at a network of secret jails. One detainee, chained half-naked to a floor, died of hypothermia.

The British security services and Blair Government were being fed information by the CIA and worked closely with the Bush administration on the 'war on terror'. 

Yet the 499-page Senate report did not contain a single reference to MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia, a British overseas base known to have been used for rendition – prompting claims it had been redacted to spare the UK's blushes.

Amid the fallout from the US Senate's explosive report into the barbaric techniques used by the CIA, ex-shadow home secretary David Davis said the UK had 'turned a blind eye' to what America was doing

The British security services and Blair Government were being fed information by the CIA and worked closely with the Bush administration on the 'war on terror'.

Over two years, the British ambassador in Washington, Sir Peter Westmacott, met with members of the committee at least 11 times.

His predecessor, Nigel Sheinwald, also held 11 meetings with members of the committee between 2009 and 2011.

Ex-Foreign Secretary William Hague also made 'representations' to the US.

An inquiry by judge Sir Peter Gibson was halted pending police inquiries but raised 27 areas requiring further investigation, ranging from interrogation techniques to so-called ‘rendition flights’, the training of agents and ministerial oversight of the agencies.

They are now being examined by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) - a move which campaigners argue is insufficiently independent.

Mr Clegg said during his weekly LBC radio phone-in: ‘Once the police investigations are done, once the report from the Intelligence and Security Committee is done, we should keep an open mind if we need to about moving to a full judicial inquiry if there are any outstanding questions.

‘I'm like anybody else: I want the truth out there.’

He went on: ‘However shocking the Senate committee report is, it's worth remembering that I doubt very much any state run by Isil or al Qaida would ever have the maturity to lift the lid on its own mistakes in the way a mature democracy like America has done.’

Mr Clegg said the Senate committee report included the ‘devastating assertion that it (torture) didn't actually keep us safe’ and may in fact have led to resources being wasted on false trails.

Prime Minister David Cameron has declared himself ‘satisfied that our system is dealing with all these issues’. 

Campaign groups want Tony Blair and ex-New Labour ministers to be grilled, too. Chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: 'There is an important issue that needs to be addressed. It's not whether the British Government or British agencies were carrying out torture. 

'It's whether the intelligence agencies benefited from information or accepted information that they either knew or ought to have known had been obtained through improper means.'

But human rights groups are adamant that a full judge-led inquiry must take place to get to the truth. 

They also want the full 6,000-page version of the Senate report to be released, not just the heavily-redacted summary.

Ed Miliband defended his brother David's record as Foreign Secretary

Ed Miliband today defended his brother's record as Foreign Secretary amid growing questions over what the last Labour government knew about American torture techniques.

The Labour leader was asked whether David had questions to answer about what he knew when he served in the Cabinet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. 

Mr Miliband said: 'He has talked about these things in the past. 

'I know how seriously he took these issues when he was in government.

'He answered questions about this in the House of Commons while he was in government.' 

The Labour leader added: 'He is never somebody who would ever countenance the British state getting engaged in this kind of activity.

'The government itself here in Britain previously announced an inquiry into these issues but then held off that inquiry because there are court cases ongoing. I think it’s right to let those court cases and those issues take their course.'

David Miliband is now head of the International Rescue Committee aid organisation in New York. 

Clare Algar, of Reprieve, said: 'We already know the UK was up to its neck in the CIA's rendition and torture programme. 

Yet the British Government continues to fight against real accountability in the UK courts.' 

Amnesty International said it was clear 'the CIA did not act alone' and called for the full report to be published.

Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said: 'I was never in any way complicit in the unlawful rendition or detention of individuals by the United States or any other state.' 

Former Home Secretary David Blunkett declined to comment.

Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg – who was paid compensation by the UK for alleged complicity in his ill-treatment – said there was a link between the torture report and the slaughter of British and US hostages in Syria.

He said terror group Islamic State was 'born out of the dungeons of Abu Ghraib, where these torture methods were being implemented'.

Islamic extremists last night vowed to kill those responsible for the torture revealed in the CIA report. Nadim al-Muhajir wrote on Twitter: 'You thought things cannot get any worse for America. But it did. These #torturereports are going to radicalise a whole generation.'

He added: 'Slaughter the bastards who are defending the CIA and justifying their actions.'
