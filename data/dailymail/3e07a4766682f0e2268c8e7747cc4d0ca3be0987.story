A grieving mother today described her ‘pain, sadness and heartbreak’ after her former husband was jailed for killing their 11-year-old daughter.

Simon Thompson, 52, was sentenced at St Albans Crown Court in Hertfordshire to 20 years in prison after he admitted killing his daughter Rebecca following a day trip to London Zoo.

He strangled the youngster - who was just about to start secondary school - and her body was found the next day in June last year by her mother Mary Thompson at her home in Bushey, near Watford.

Thompson pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. It is thought that after killing his daughter he tried to take his own life by driving at high speed into a roundabout.

Mrs Thompson said today: ‘Rebecca and I were so very close and enjoyed a wonderful relationship. Her father killed her in such cruel circumstances leaving me to find her dead.

'This has left me totally destroyed and devastated. Rebecca was such a loving and caring child who adored animals and being with people. I miss her so much, my life has become so empty without her.

‘I had made plans for a new life with Rebecca but we had no chance to give that a try. It seems her controlling and manipulative bully of a father could not stand the thought of us moving on and being happy.’

She added: ‘Now I face a life-time of loneliness and only memories without my darling girl. The grief that fills me is hard to explain, it is like I have been forced to step out of one life into another which is full of pain, sadness and heartbreak.

‘Like many young girls Rebecca liked fashion and music but now we will never go shopping together again or meet up with local friends for a coffee and a chat. I have no feeling towards my ex-husband and regard him with the contempt that he deserves.’

Jane Bickerstaff QC, prosecuting, told the court that Thompson and his wife had been married since 1998 but by June 21 last year, they had effectively been estranged for five years.

Mrs Thompson had bought his share of the property but he stayed on as a lodger and they slept in separate rooms - her in one and him and Rebecca in another.

His wife then met and formed a relationship with Colin Macdonald, who she had introduced Rebecca to on holiday in Tenerife and who she had told her husband was ‘more than a friend’.

‘She wanted the situation to end and the defendant had been given noticed to leave by June 1 and find somewhere else to live,’ said Miss Bickerstaff, adding that Thompson had failed to comply.

‘She gave him a final notice to leave by July 1. The date of Rebecca’s death was approximately a week before this deadline.

‘The defendant was facing the impending 
prospect that he would no longer be living in the same house as his 
daughter, let alone the same room.’

On June 21, Thompson called his daughter’s school and lied that she had been sick overnight. He then got a taxi to take them from their home to London Zoo, in Regents Park.

Meanwhile Mrs Thompson had gone to a course in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, from where she was to head to see her new partner for the weekend.

The prosecutor said: ‘The defendant and Rebecca were collected by taxi and driven back, arriving about 6pm.

‘In the period between 6.07pm and 11.30pm the defendant had taken Rebecca’s dressing gown cord from her dressing gown on the back of the door and strangled her to death with it.

‘There were no defensive injuries and it is likely that strangulation was done in her sleep.’

She added: ‘The Crown submits a sleeping child in the adult’s care is among the most vulnerable of victims.’

The court heard Thompson was seen on his driveway by a neighbour, who thought it unusual as the defendant was normally in bed by 8.30pm.

Thompson then got into his Volkswagen Golf, towards the A41, where he was seen driving towards a roundabout at what one witness estimated as 100mph.

The force of the impact propelled the engine out of the car and left the defendant with serious leg injuries, but alive.

He was taken to hospital in London while police officers went to his home but found it locked and nobody answering.

They tried to contact Mrs Thompson and left messages and the following morning, on June 22, she received them and tried, through hospital staff, to find out what had happened to her daughter.

Thompson, who was believed to be unemployed and not known to have any friends, claimed she was fine and with his colleagues.

Mrs Thompson went to the hospital to confront him directly and it was only after repeated denials that he finally confessed Rebecca was at home.

The worried mother then had her worst fears realised, discovering her only child’s lifeless body. She told Mr Macdonald: ‘She’s cold. She’s cold. She’s dead. Call an ambulance.’

The little girl still had the cord around her neck.

Psychiatric experts concluded that 
Thompson had Asperger’s syndrome and depression and that his actions 
occurred because of a combination of circumstances which were unlikely 
to be repeated.

Bernard Richmond QC, defending, said his client did not consider himself worthy of sympathy.

He
 said the killing had resulted from Thompson’s ‘abnormal thinking’, 
adding: ‘Within the warped reasoning going on on that day, this was seen
 as an act of mercy.’

The defendant’s situation would only become worse as he received treatment for his condition, he said.

‘The enormity and sheer horror of that will grow and will continue to haunt him. That is a very real punishment. This has been a tragedy not undertaken by a man either evil or angry.’

Judge Stephen Gullick told Thompson: ‘This was a deliberate and considered act by you which involved the taking of a life of another human being.

‘Rebecca was your own daughter. She was 
entitled to expect that you would protect and care for her and not take 
her life while she was asleep.

'Rebecca had her whole life ahead of her and her chance for a future has been taken away by someone who was supposed to keep her safe'

Detective Inspector John Arthur, Hertfordshire Constabulary

‘She was tucked up in bed in a place regarded by her as her home, in her mind a very safe place indeed. A breach of trust could not have been more gross.’

Thompson, appearing via a videolink from Bedford Prison, where he has been held in the hospital wing because of his leg injuries, showed little emotion during the hearing.

Hertfordshire Constabulary’s Detective Inspector John Arthur, who led the investigation, said: ‘Simon Thompson has been professionally identified as a man who had psychiatric issues at the time.

‘However his actions last summer were callous when he killed his daughter, his only child, leaving her mother distraught. There are no words of comfort in cases such as these.

'Rebecca had her whole life ahead of her and her chance for a future has been taken away by someone who was supposed to keep her safe and protect her from the dangers in this world.

‘On behalf of my team can I thank Rebecca’s mother and friends for the dignity and courage they have shown during what has been a very difficult time for them and hope that with time they can rebuild their lives.’
