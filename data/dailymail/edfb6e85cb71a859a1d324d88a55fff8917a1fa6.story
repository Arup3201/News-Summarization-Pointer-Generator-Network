A jealous husband drugged his wife before strangling her to death at their home after finding out she was having an affair with another man, a court heard.

Andrew Leigh, 42, is accused of murdering his estranged wife of eight years Luan, 42, after she rejected his attempts to get back together.

Birmingham Crown Court heard today how Miss Leigh's body was discovered at the property in the Pype Hayes area of Birmingham at about 7.25am on June 29.

The court heard how Leigh, a telecommunications engineer, had moved out of the property about a year ago but wanted to rekindle his relationship with his wife.

However, she had 'moved on' and, in a jealous revenge attack, he allegedly drugged her with sleeping pills before strangling her to death in her own bed, jurors were told on the opening day of the trial.

Opening the case, Rachel Brand QC, prosecuting, said: 'It was about 6.45am on June 29 when the defendant rang his wife's sister, a woman called Natasha Chamberlain.

'His opening remark was "I am really sorry, Natasha, but your sister has passed away."

'Natasha replied: "What the hell do you mean? What has happened?"

'He told her he found her dead in bed at about 10.30pm the previous evening but did not call an ambulance because he did know what to do at the time.

'He had killed his wife.

'When the ambulance arrived on the Sunday morning, Luan Leigh was as cold as ice.'

Jurors were told that Leigh had drugged his wife on the Saturday evening with over-the-counter sleeping pills.

Traces of the main ingredients were found in Mrs Leigh's blood during a post-mortem examination.

Ms Brand said: 'We do not how much was given to Luan...but we do know she was drugged.

'Police found the empty packet of tablets, along with their receipt and instructions of use in the house.

'He was on CCTV buying [tablets] in the Lloyds pharmacy in Walmley on the Saturday morning.'

The court heard how Leigh had become aware his estranged partner was dating somebody else after going through her phone and trying to hack her Facebook account.

Ms Brand added: 'Luan told her sister and friends that he once locked her in her garage in a bid to get back together.

'He had also tried to hack into her Facebook account.

'About one week before her death, Luan told Andrew that she did not want him to go on a family holiday and gave him his money back. She wanted to take her mother instead.

'It transpired that the defendant had been snooping around her mobile phone on the evening of June 25.

'She had just starting seeing someone else and the defendant found out about it. He did not move on.'

Leigh denies one count of murder.

The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.
