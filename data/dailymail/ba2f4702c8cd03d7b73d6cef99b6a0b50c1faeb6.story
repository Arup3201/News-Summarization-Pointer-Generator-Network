Tragedy: Scott Stone was allegedly stabbed to death after a row with a neighbour over reggae music being played too loud

A young father who worked with a homeless charity was allegedly stabbed to death after a row with a neighbour over reggae music being played too loud.

Charity worker Scott Stone, 26, was found dead outside his flat, after it was believed he had complained about loud music keeping his young daughter awake.

Neighbours in the block in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, said they had heard loud music and then shouting before police and paramedics arrived. 

Paul Dillon, 52, who lives in the same block of flats was in court today charged with Mr Stone’s murder.

Dillon appeared at St Albans Crown Court via videolink. He was remanded in custody until his next appearance at the court scheduled for June 16.

Today Mr Stone's mother Lesley revealed her son had worked with a charity for homeless people, helping them find accommodation, offering them support and helping to develop their work and life skills. 

'He absolutely loved his work,' she said.

'He was involved with so many different things and he really enjoyed it all.

'He had a naturally caring nature. In his previous job he was asked to take an elderly man to see his sister in Norfolk as she was seriously ill.

'Scott didn’t hesitate. He took him and was his personal carer for the entire trip.'

Mr Stone had an 18-month-old daughter Ebony with his girlfriend Rachel, with the little girl described as 'his world'.

'He was a loveable rogue and related with people so easily,' said his mother.

'He always defended those who were targeted or bullied, was always happy to help people and do anyone a favour.

'He was on the bus once and he stood up for a disabled person who was being picked on by a group of school children and every year he would always help our neighbours with their Christmas lights.'

Mr Stone was found dead in his block of flats on Sunday, with his body believed to have been found in a stairwell.

After the incident the scene was cordoned off and police refused to let residents use the lift and stairs on one side of the building.

Paramedics were rushed to the scene after being called by members of the public but he was  pronounced dead at the scene.

Neighbours spoke of noisy reggae music and a confrontation, before shouting and then police and paramedics arriving.

'The music was on very loud in the afternoon,' said one woman, who asked to remain anonymous.

'It was reggae music, like Bob Marley played.

'The young man was getting really angry about it and there was an argument.

'I don't know if that's why they got into a fight later on.'
