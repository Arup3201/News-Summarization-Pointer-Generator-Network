A super-fit British triathlon competitor has died after crashing into a wall in an ‘Ironman’ event in the south of France.

The 30-year-old, who has not been named but who is believed to be from the London area, went off the road during the cycle leg of the gruelling course in Nice.

It involved a 2.64 mile swim, a 111 mile bicycle ride and a standard 26 mile marathon run.

Under a cloud: The race was won by French triathlete Frederic Van Lierde, right. But the victory was overshadowed by the tragedy on Sunday

The man was said to be coping well with the course but got into difficulty at Tourrettes-sur-Loup, a medieval village inland from Nice.

After climbing to a height of 1,246 m (4,088 ft), the rider was making a high speed descent down when he crashed into the wall.

‘He suffered a major head injury, and had a cardiac arrest,’ said a spokesman for the local emergency services.

‘The accident happened at around 9.30am on Sunday on a sharp curve on the RD2210 road at Tourrettes-sur-Loup. The competitor lost control of his bike and hit the wall.

Ironman France is the biggest annual triathlon on the French Riviera, and attracts competitors from all over the world, including many from the UK.
