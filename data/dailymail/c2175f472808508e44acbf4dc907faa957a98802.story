A criminal investigation has been launched into a mix-up at a mortuary where the body of a Falklands war veteran who died in police custody turned up in a mortuary more than a decade after he was believed to have been buried.

Ex-paratrooper Christopher Alder, 37, choked to death while handcuffed and lying on the floor of a police station in Hull, in the early hours of April 1 1998.

It now appears a Hull pensioner called Grace Kamara was buried in his place in 2000.

Christopher Alder choked to death at a police station in 1998. It has been discovered that his body has laid in a mortuary for ten years when it was thought he had been buried

Christopher Alder was a former paratrooper. An inquest found that four police officers were guilty of the 'most serious neglect of duty' when he died

Mrs Kamara is understood to have died from natural causes in 1999 but her burial was delayed and finally scheduled for Friday.

It appears the blunder was only discovered because her friends and family asked to see the body and Mr Alder's remains were found in its place in the mortuary.

Yesterday Nicola Yates, chief executive of Hull City Council, apologised and launched an investigation.

Today she said the police were being brought in.

Mr Alder's sister Janet has battled for justice, but lost a recent challenge after claiming she had been racially abused during the investigation

She said: 'As chair of the multi-agency group dealing with the tragic circumstances around Grace Kamara and Christopher Alder, I have requested that the police undertake a criminal investigation into this extremely distressing case.

'As I said last night, I am appalled and distraught at what we have learned and my first priority has been to make sure the families involved are kept informed and given the necessary support.

'It is vital that the families and the public get a clear view of the facts and understand what happened. A thorough police investigation will make sure this happens.

'Now that the police are carrying out a formal investigation it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.

'I recognise that this has been very traumatic for everyone involved and I again offer my sincere sympathies to the families.'

Humberside Police's chief constable Tim Hollis said the investigation will be carried out by the South Yorkshire force due to the sensitive history of the case.

Mr Hollis said: 'Whilst the role of the police is to provide investigative support to the respective authorities I am, naturally, mindful of the strong association of Humberside Police with Christopher Alder's name and his sad death.

'It is, therefore, my decision to invite South Yorkshire Police to provide a team of officers to undertake any necessary investigation into the circumstances that have come to light.

'On a personal note, my thoughts are with the family of Mrs Kamara who, at this time, still do not know the whereabouts of her body and to Christopher Alder's family who have now been informed that Christopher's body was not buried, as they believed, in November 2000.

'Officers from South Yorkshire Police will conduct the investigation, on behalf of Humberside Police.

'This investigation will examine the circumstances surrounding the retention and safe keeping of the bodies of Christopher Alder and Grace Kamara and their subsequent release for interment.'

In another statement, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust chief executive Phil Morley said: 'We realise how distressing this incident has been for the families of those concerned and our thoughts are with them.

'We also recognise that other members of the public may have concerns, however, following a full review this weekend the trust is confident that our systems for the identification and release of bodies from the mortuary are robust.

'It is extremely rare for a body to be retained for more than a few days in a mortuary. The normal process is to establish the cause of death, to formally identify the body and properly release the body to the family. This is usually done within 72 hours and the vast majority of bodies are only kept for this time period.

'All bodies upon release have to be correctly identified and signed out by both mortuary staff and those taking responsibility for the body.

'While this remains the subject of a criminal investigation we do not believe it is appropriate to comment further.'

Yesterday, Mr Alder's sister Janet expressed her shock over the mix-up branding it 'disgusting'.

The 49-year-old said: ‘[Police] told me that in 1999 a 
woman called Grace Kamara, who was about 60, died from a heart attack. 
She was kept in deep freeze because her family, who all live in Nigeria,
were asking for repatriation.’

Miss Alder added: ‘The undertakers went to get the body and it was then they found it wasn’t Grace, it was a man.

‘It’s just unbelievable – the police 
even said to me that they can’t say for sure that it was Grace that was 
buried in Christopher’s grave. I don’t know what to believe.’ 

Miss Alder has been told by 
officers that in 2000 the Hull mortuary where her brother’s body was 
kept had been moved to an unknown, temporary location.

A year later it was moved permanently to Hull Royal Infirmary.

Miss Alder added: ‘I want to know what’s happened to Christopher’s body all these years.

‘It’s like they just went into the mortuary, saw a black person and said “send this one out”.’

Mr Alder, a father-of-two choked to death at the feet of four officers 
on a police cell floor on April 1, 1998.

He had been punched during an 
argument outside a nightclub in his home city of Hull and was taken to 
hospital, where he became hostile, perhaps because of his head injury. 
He was then discharged into the hands of Humberside Police, who arrested
him for a breach of the peace and took him to Queen’s Gardens police 
station.

By the time he arrived, he was 
unconscious and his trousers were around his knees. He was left 
handcuffed on the floor while the four officers looked on and did 
nothing.

They could allegedly be heard on CCTV
footage making monkey noises as he lay dying for 11 minutes. They later
claimed they thought he was ‘putting on an act’.

But a damning report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found the men responsible of ‘unwitting racism’. It concluded that PC Matthew Barr, PC Neil Blakey, PC Nigel Dawson and Sergeant John Dunn – who all refused to co-operate with the IPCC investigation – were guilty of a ‘most serious neglect of duty’.

The officers were charged with manslaughter but acquitted at Teesside Crown Court in 2002 on the orders of the trial judge.
