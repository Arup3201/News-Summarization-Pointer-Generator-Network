Laura Skywalker Matthews added the Jedi middle name by deed poll in 2008 ¿for a laugh¿

A Star Wars fan missed out on her summer holiday after she was refused a passport because she changed her name to Skywalker.

Laura Skywalker Matthews added the Jedi middle name by deed poll in 2008 ‘for a laugh’ after joking with friends about her love of lead character Luke Skywalker.

But the joke backfired when officials took eight weeks to refuse her passport application - meaning Miss Matthews missed out on a summer break to Amsterdam.

The 29-year-old was told by passport officials that her new signature L Skywalker infringed on a trademark - despite it previously having been accepted for her driving licence.

She said: ‘It's absolutely ridiculous. They told me the issue was with my signature because L Skywalker is trademark.

‘I have the same signature on my driving licence, bank cards and everything else.

‘How can everybody else be happy with that signature, apart from the passport office?

‘Luke Skywalker is a trademark but not my signature “L Skywalker”.

‘It's been extremely stressful trying to sort all this out and I've now missed my trip to Amsterdam.

‘The whole application process has been an utter shambles from start to finish.

‘I never knew a little joke between friends was going to cause this many problems.’

Miss Matthews sent off for a new passport in May ahead of a pre-planned trip to Amsterdam on July 16.

But despite numerous calls to follow up the application, she was only told this week that her application had been refused.

The home claims adviser, who lives with her partner Darren Stewart, 30, at their home in Southend, Essex, said: ‘I changed my name by deed poll back in 2008.

‘I really like Star Wars and me and a friend were joking about what silly name we would have if we could choose one.

‘I just did it for a laugh as it only cost £49. It's just a middle name so I never realised it was going to cause all this fuss.

‘I've been chasing the passport office up since the beginning of July but they have been hopeless.’

Miss Matthews has since been told she will need to reapply for a new passport with her old signature.

She added: ‘I just wish they had told me all this sooner so I didn't have to miss out on my holiday.

‘They knew this was a problem at the beginning of July - if they had told me then I might have been able to sort it out in time.

‘Now I am going to have a driving licence with one signature and a passport with another.‘The whole situation is a complete mess.’

A Home Office spokesman said they ‘will not recognise a change to a name which is subject to copyright or trademark’.

He added: ‘We have a duty to ensure the reputation of the UK passport is not called into question or disrepute.’
