For Norma McGivern, her neighbour was a lifeline.

Jacqueline Carolan helped the 76-year-old with her shopping, did small chores around the house and walked the widow’s pet dog, Alfie.

The frail pensioner thought so much of her ‘best friend’ that they even went on holiday together

But Carolan, 46, was no Good Samaritan – she was ‘grooming’ Mrs McGivern in a bid to plunder her life savings, eventually stealing almost £2,000.

Friends: Norma McGivern, 76, (right) was so close to Jacqueline Carolan, 46, (left) that the pair even holidayed to Ibiza together. However, Carolan was withdrawing money from Mrs McGiven's life savings each time she offered to take the grandmother's dog for a walk

Scam: Carolan persuaded the grandmother to reveal her PIN number as her elderly neighbour was fearful of using cash machines and withdrew a total of £1,870 from her account

And when Mrs McGivern discovered the shocking betrayal she suffered a massive heart attack, fell down the stairs and died.

As
 Carolan began a six-month prison sentence last night, Mrs McGivern’s 
family condemned the fraudster and blamed her for the death. Her 
daughter Pam Bryan, 48, said: ‘Jacqueline came across as such a lovely 
lady but basically she had groomed her.’

Mrs Bryan said the two friends went on several day trips together and even went on a holiday to Ibiza in 2012.

Stress: Mrs McGivern's daughter Pam Bryan, 48, believes the betrayal had contributed to her mother's death

Mrs
 McGivern trusted her sufficiently that, last year, when Carolan asked 
to borrow £100 for a holiday, she went with her friend to withdraw the 
money at an ATM, revealing her pin number in the process.

After
 this, unemployed Carolan would visit Mrs McGivern on the pretext of 
taking her shih tzu for a walk but would also take the bank card from 
her handbag. She withdrew up to £250 on 14 occasions, stealing £1,870 
over three months.

The court heard Carolan of Failsworth, near Oldham, used  the cash to pay for holidays and  manicures.

Mrs
 McGivern didn’t notice the disappearing funds at first because her bank
 statements were sent quarterly. When she did, she told her family and 
they alerted her to the unexplained withdrawals.

She originally dismissed their fears about Carolan before a trap was set that caught her in the act.

On
 the day Carolan was arrested by police last December, Mrs McGivern 
suffered a fatal heart attack. The grandmother was said to be absolutely
 mortified that her friend and confidante had plundered her life 
savings.

Mrs Bryan said: ‘My mum couldn’t cope with the fact somebody had done that to her.  

‘She
 loved her and thought she was her best friend. I think this contributed
 to her death. She would still be here today without all this. She would
 easily have more years in her.’

Carolan,
 who had no previous convictions, admitted fraud and was jailed for six 
months. Sentencing her, Judge Lever branded Carolan’s behaviour as 
‘despicable’.
