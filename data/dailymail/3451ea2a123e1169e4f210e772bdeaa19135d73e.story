No sooner have predictions of one Mayan apocalypse passed by without incident, another has surfaced to keep the doomsday faithful believing.

Just two days after the much-anticipated end of the world failed to materialise, one historian has re-ignited the debate by claiming that Armageddon could come tomorrow instead.

Many apocalypse believers were left red-faced when the December 21 date they so publicly announced as the end went without a hitch.

But Nikolai Grube, a leading expert in 
Mesoamerican advanced civilisations from the University of Bonn, 
believes interpretations of the Mayan calendar may actually be off by a few days.

More of this on Christmas Eve? Men dressed in 'martian' outfits pictured on December 21 in the village of Bugarach, France, where some thought an alien spacecraft would emerge to save them from the Mayan apocalypse that never materialised

Optimistic: Guatemalans host celebrations marking the end of the Mayan age at the Tikal archaeological site on December 21. An historian believes the end could actually come on Christmas Eve instead

The original calculations were based on the Mayan long count calendar, which pin-pointed the end of the 13th baktun on December.

A baktun is equivalent to around 144,000 days or 394 years.

But Mr Grube says matching up our own present-day calendar with that of the Mayans is not an exact science and a deviation of a few days to Christmas Eve is plausible.

He also casts further doubt on there even being a Mayan prediction of an apocalypse at all.

He said several Mayan texts have been deciphered which mention days well beyond this Christmas.

Mr Grube told ABC News: 'You find dates in Mayan texts that are thousands or millions of years into the future.'

All over again: Nikolai Grube, an historian from the University of Bonn, says calculations based on the Mayan Long Count calendar (above) that predicted December 21 as the apocalypse may have been off by a few days

Cult following: Crowds also gathered in Times Square, New York, in anticipation of the so-called Mayan Apocalypse on December 21

For centuries, the ending of the Mayan calendar, which supposedly occurred on December 21, has been taken as a sign of an impending Armageddon.

But
there were a few sheepish looks in a corner of south-east France, which
was cited as the only safe spot.

Bugarach,
in the foothills of the Pyrenees, is said to contain a mystical UFO 
garage which will ferry people off planet earth as the Mayan Calendar 
runs out.

Doomsday 
followers were convinced here will be no December 22 for anyone except 
for those who make it to the hamlet, which has a population of 189 
people.

It had swelled to around three times that amount today, with some 200 journalists joining mainly 'New Age types'.

And one gambler was left red-faced after putting a £10 bet on the apocalypse, standing to win £50,000 if the world had ended.

Martin
Muller, a 26-year-old, from London, made the bizarre bet at odds of 
5,000-1  after hearing of the Mayan Prophecy that the world would be 
destroyed, or changed, at 11.11am (GMT) on December 21.

Scientists
in Taiwan also had their tongues firmly in cheek, setting up a 
two-story replica of a Mayan pyramid and planting an electronic 
countdown timer on top, drawing crowds at the National Museum of Natural
Science.

'This is not the 
end of the world. This is the beginning of the new world,' Star 
Johnsen-Moser, an American seer, said at a gathering of hundreds of 
spiritualists at a convention centre in Mexico's Yucatan city of Merida,
an hour and a half from the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza.

The Maya, who invented an amazingly accurate calendar almost 2,000 years ago, measured time in 394-year periods known as baktuns.

Some anthropologists believe the 13th baktun ends on December 21.

Still, archaeologists have uncovered Mayan glyphs that refer to dates far, far in the future, long beyond December 21.
