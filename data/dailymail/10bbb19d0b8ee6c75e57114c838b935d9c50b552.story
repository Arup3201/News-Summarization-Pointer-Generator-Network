A rebel rocket struck a weapons depot in the central Syrian city of Homs today setting off a series of huge explosions that killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens of others.

The blasts sent a massive fireball into the sky, causing widespread damage and panic among residents, many of whom are supporters of President Bashar Assad.

One resident said the explosions were so strong they cracked the walls of some buildings. Thick smoke and dust could be seen from a distance as explosions shook the ground.

A video posted online by activists showed a huge ball of fire over Homs neighborhoods.

The
explosions, which follow significant advances by Assad's military, show
rebel forces still have the capacity to strike back.

An
official at the governor's office in Homs said about 10 rockets slammed
into the neighborhood of Zahra and the nearby sports stadium, sparking a
large fire and causing several casualties.

He said the explosions caused massive destruction and wounded at least 130 people. He didn't offer a number for those killed.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an anti-Assad monitoring group, said that the blast killed at least 40 soldiers and civilians and left 120 wounded, some in a critical condition.

A rebel in Homs said that the attack was caused by a surface-to-surface 'Grad' missile. He would not say which rebel group fired the missile.

A local resident corroborated that 
account, saying he heard blasts for more than an hour after the first 
explosion. He said they could be heard from the overwhelmingly 
pro-regime districts of Wadi Dahab and al-Walid, where the regime is 
known to keep arms depots.

'Rockets
were falling on the area ... when the arms depot began to explode but 
we don't know if the rockets triggered the blasts,' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

He
said the explosions were so strong that 'they shook parts of the city.'
They also shattered all windows in the area and cracked walls, he 
added.

He said he spoke with Syrian Arab Red Crescent paramedics who told him that at least 22 bodies were taken to hospitals.

The
explosions in Homs coincided with a rare trip by President Bashar Assad
to a former rebel bastion near the capital, Damascus, to mark Army Day.

Assad's visit to Daraya is his first known public trip outside the capital, his seat of power, in more than a year.

He
said he was confident of victory against rebels and made a symbolic 
visit to a town once overrun by insurgents but now mostly retaken by his
army.

'If we were not sure 
that we were going to win in Syria, we would not have the ability to 
resist and the ability to continue fighting for more than two years 
against the enemy,' Assad was quoted as saying by state news agency 
SANA.

Insurgents have seized
large swathes of territory, but Assad's forces have staged a 
counter-offensive in recent weeks, pushing them back from around the 
capital Damascus and retaking several towns near the border with 
Lebanon.

Assad has framed the revolt against four decades of his family's rule as a foreign-backed conspiracy fought by Islamist 'terrorists'.

More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against the Assad family's four-decade rule began in March 2011. The revolt later escalated into a civil war, which has uprooted millions of people from their homes.

U.N. investigators say Assad's forces have carried out war crimes including unlawful killing, torture, sexual violence, indiscriminate attacks and pillaging in what appears to be a state-directed policy.

They say rebels have also committed war crimes, including executions, but on a lesser scale.

Both sides accuse the other of using chemical weapons and - after months of diplomatic wrangling between the United Nations and Damascus over access - a chemical weapons investigation team will visit three sites where alleged attacks have occurred, the United Nations said on Wednesday.

It is hard to say if the trip will be able to establish who was behind the attacks.

One attack in the northern town of Khan al-Assal was in March and samples of Sarin gas - a fast-acting nerve agent that was originally developed in 1938 in Germany as a pesticide - can degrade very quickly, within weeks.

Rebels also seized Khan al-Assal from Assad's forces last week so access to the site could be hard from the government side. There is still fighting in the area.

At best, weapons inspectors will only determine scientifically whether banned chemical agents were used in the 28-month-old conflict, and not who used them, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which works with the United Nations on inspections.

Members of the 15-person team assembled by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had been on standby in Cyprus since April and have only last month went to Turkey to gather evidence. The U.N. chemical weapons experts cannot enter Syria without the government's permission.

The struggle in Syria has become markedly sectarian, broadly pitting majority Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's minority Alawite sect, which is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.

Assad has relied on Alawite-led army units and security forces from the start, but has turned increasingly to loyalist militia armed and funded by Damascus to fight the rebels.

He has also received solid support from Shi'ite regional powerhouse Iran, Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and longtime ally Russia, while his fragmented foes have received little military aid from their Western backers, wary of the growing presence of hardline Islamist groups, some of which are linked to al Qaeda.

Nine European Union nations urged the European Parliament on Thursday to back plans for an EU-wide passenger data list aimed at thwarting suspected militants travelling from Europe to fight in Syria, fearing they will return to home to carry out attacks in Europe.
