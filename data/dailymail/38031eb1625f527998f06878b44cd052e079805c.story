Grieving friends and relatives gathered in a poverty-stricken Indonesian village this morning for the funeral of Sumarti Ningsih - one of the women found murdered in Rurik Jutting's Hong Kong flat.

Her heartbroken father Ahmad Kaliman watched as the 25 year old's coffin was carried to a graveyard in remote Gandrungmangu - a village in the Cilacap region of Java island.

With relatives in tears around him, Miss Ningsih's brother Mohammed Rohmat tenderly placed his hand on his sister's coffin before she was eventually laid to rest.

Sex workers Miss Ningsih and Seneng Mujiasih, 28, were found murdered in Jutting's luxury apartment last week, with the British former banker now undergoing psychiatric tests to determine whether he is fit to stand trial on double murder charges.

While Miss Mujiasih was discovered dying with her throat slashed and knife wounds to her buttocks when police arrived, Miss Ningsih's mutilated corpse was found stuffed into a suitcase a placed on Jutting's balcony. It is believed she had been dead for five days at the time of the discovery.

Sumarti Ningshi, a mother of one who left Gandrungmangu for a better life in Hong Kong, was killed and stuffed into a suitcase at Jutting's flat

Miss Ningsih's funeral took place this morning in her home village, which she left in her late teens to start a new life as a domestic worker in Hong Kong. She had earlier married and divorced, and is the mother of a six year old son who has been raised by her parents. 

While working in Hong Kong, Miss Ningsih was able to send large sums of money back to Gandrungmangu to help pay for her son's education, but problems with her visa meant she started struggling to find domestic and waitress work, and was forced to become a prostitute.

This morning dozens of friends and relatives turned out for her funeral service, carrying her coffin in a solemn procession through the village she fled in the hope of finding a better life abroad.

Her funeral took place shortly after the body of her fellow murder victim Seneng Mujiasih arrived back in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, from where it will be taken for burial to her own hometown on Indonesia's Muna Island.

The bodies were returned home just one day after Jutting, 29 - who reportedly earned £350,00 a year as a banker - was pictured chuckling to himself in the back of a prison van after being sent for psychiatric tests to determine whether he is fit to stand trial.

He had appeared at a hearing earlier in the day charged with double murder.

On Monday Jutting was today sent for psychiatric tests to determine if he is fit to stand trial for the murders of the two Indonesian prostitutes.

The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out and the banker was remanded in custody.

As he left court, Jutting was pictured chuckling in the back of a prison van surrounded by security guards wearing face masks.

His lawyer, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, but did not rule out giving consent in future.

Jutting, bearded and wearing black-rimmed glasses, remained impassive during the brief hearing at the Eastern Magistrate's court - his second appearance after being charged with the murders a week ago.

He spoke only once to say 'I do' when the magistrate asked him whether he understood the arrangements. 

The case was 'adjourned... for two psychiatric reports on the defendant's fitness to plead', said principal magistrate Bina Chainrai.

Reports by two different doctors are required under Hong Kong law, said prosecutor Louise Wong who confirmed Jutting is being held at the maximum-security Siu Lam psychiatric centre.

He will next appear in court on November 24.

Following the hearing, Hong Kong solicitor Michael Vidler, who is also acting in Jutting's defence, said it could be months before a plea is entered.

Yesterday it emerged that Seneng Mujiasih sent a message saying she wanted to 'get out of here' just minutes before her death at the luxury flat.

The sex worker, who was also known as Jesse Lorena, is understood to have sent a text to a friend complaining of a 'really bad' smell inside the flat at 3.25am on Saturday November 1.

At 3.45am police found Ms Mujiasih dying in the apartment with her throat slashed and knife wounds to her buttocks. They later discovered the mutilated corpse Miss Ningsih on Jutting's balcony, having been stuffed into a suitcase five days earlier.

Tragic: Seneng Mujiasih (pictured) was also found dying with her throat slashed on the sitting room floor of Rurik Jutting's apartment at 3.45am on Saturday November 1. 25 minutes earlier she sent a message to a friend raising concerns about being in the property and complaining of a 'really bad' smell

Victim: Officers arrived at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find Jesse Lorena Ruri still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks, but she died soon after

According to witnesses, Seneng Mujiasih met Jutting at the nearby New Makati Pub & Disco sometime after 1.35am on Saturday morning. At 3.45am, she was found dying on the floor of his apartment building

Ms Mujiasih was found dying with her throat slashed on the sitting room floor of Jutting's apartment at 3.45am,  Hong Kong police have revealed.

Just 20 minutes earlier she had texted a friend to raise concerns over her visit, saying: 'Something smells really bad – I want to get out of here,' according to The Telegraph, who quoted a source close to the victim who asked not to be named.

According to witnesses, Ms Mujiasih met Jutting at the nearby New Makati Pub & Disco sometime after 1.35am. Security footage shows the pair walking in the direction of his apartment shortly after 2.15am but what happened between their arrival and Ms Mujiasih's death remains a mystery.

Although it remains unclear exactly why Ms Mujiasih wanted to leave the flat and what the 'really bad' smell was, other residents in the building are said to have complained of a 'dead animal' stench in the building's corridors. They were later told the smell was from the first victim's decomposing body.

Police had been called to the property on Halloween night and first found 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih with wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died a short time later.

Remanded: A lawyer for Jutting, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, but did not rule out giving consent in future

Jutting moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year and is understood to have quit his highly-paid job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in the days before the incident.  

Before leaving, he appeared to have set a sinister out of office automatic response for his email account at the bank.

'I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody (Last line only really worked if I had followed through),' the email read. 

The former public schoolboy was arrested after calling police to his £2,000-a-month high-rise flat following a night out at the Makati Pub & Disco.
