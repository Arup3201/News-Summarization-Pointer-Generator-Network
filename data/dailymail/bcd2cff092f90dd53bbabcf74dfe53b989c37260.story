When photographer Suleyman Oguz took his dog for a walk in Turkey, he was probably hoping to capture some prized shots of his pet.

But instead the clumsy canine ended up making himself the mutt of the joke after tripping over his own feet.

Oguz was perfectly placed to capture the animal's look of shock and confusion at the exact moment its face met the floor.

Scooby Doh!: The husky was running for a treat when his excitement got the better of him

The accident happened while the young husky was running for a treat Oguz's wife had just taken out of her pocket.

However his excitement got the better of him as he rushed for the snack and he was soon sent flying.

Oguz, 40, said 'I was taking pictures of the dog when my wife took out a snack from her pocket. The dog spotted it immediately and darted towards us with its tongue hanging out.

Suleyman Oguz (left) was walking the dog with his wife (right) when she offered it the snack. The couple felt so bad for laughing at the pooch's misfortune they gave it an extra treat

'All of a sudden it tripped over its own feet and I managed to get a picture of the exact moment it fell. It looks so dumbfounded in the picture, we both found it very amusing.

'It wasn't hurt and seemed perfectly fine afterwards but we gave it an extra treat because we felt guilty for laughing so much.'
