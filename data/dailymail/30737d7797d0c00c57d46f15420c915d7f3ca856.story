Prince Harry joined crowds of thirsty ale-lovers to attend the Great British Beer festival in London yesterday afternoon. 

The 29-year-old sported a baseball cap and chinos to attend the event and drifted between stands of cider and craft beers with a group of friends. 

He was among thousands of beer-enthusiasts at the event held in west London's Olympia, a stone's throw from Kensington Palace.

Prince Harry was seen at the Great British Beer Festival at Olympia in west London yesterday afternoon 

Inconspicuously dressed, the royal joined groups of Druids and drag artists at the festival which showcased more than 1,000 beers.

He and a small group of friends were even seen taking part in pub games including Shut The Box - a traditional board game.  

Staff holder John Craye said it was only after the group had visited the games that he realised he had served royalty.

He said: 'I was quite tempted to say to this gentleman that he looked quite a lot like Prince Harry, but I thought quite a lot of people tell him that.

'I was somewhat surprised to learn after that it was indeed him.'

Mr Craye said Harry was dolling out tips on how to win to the rest of the group, though it's not known whether or not they took home first prize - a jumper with a picture of the Queen emblazoned on the front. 

He added: 'Prince Harry was here to have a good time like the other 20,000 visitors to the festival so far this week.

'He just wanted to be treated like a normal person.'

It is believed the Prince spent around two hours at the festival.

Fellow stall holder Les White said that although Harry did not have a glass in his hand during his visit to the stall, he believed the Prince had already sampled some of the beers.

The festival attracts thousands of beer-lovers every year and showcases more than 1,000 varieties of the drink

Mr White said: 'I looked over and I thought "Wow - he really looks like Prince Harry". 

'At first I thought he was a lookalike.

'He and his friends were definitely enjoying themselves.'

The festival runs from August 12-16 and attracted around 20,000 people last year. There are 11 brewery bars and thousands of beers, ciders and perries for guests to try. 

Visitors can take part in beer tasting tutorials and sample food from vendors scattered across the arena. 

Organiser Ian Hill said: 'He certainly seemed to be having a good time with his friends, enjoying the real ales on offer and even trying his hand at some traditional pub games. 

The royal was seen by staff enjoying pub games with his friends and wandering between bars at the event 

Earlier in the week Prince Harry introduced the British team for the inaugural Invictus Games with a speech 

'We would happily invite him to visit the festival again in the future.'

Earlier in the week the Prince announced the 130-member team taking part in his inaugural Invictus Games. 

Made up of veterans and members of the armed forces, the British team will take on 13 other countries in the contest for wounded servicemen and women in September.  

Kensington Palace declined to comment on his attending the Great British Beer Festival this afternoon.
