A good Samaritan trying to stop a domestic dispute on his front lawn was shot dead Thursday.

Rubin Brown, 27, was killed in his South Dallas home after he intervened in an argument a couple was having early in the morning in his driveway.

According to the victim's fiancee, Quenetha Bell, the man and woman who were fighting later returned with friends and shot up their car and house, killing Brown while she hid their 2-year-old son under a bed.

'He didn't deserve this,' a devastated Bell told Dallasnews.com. 'He took care of this household. He took care of his kids. He provided.'

Police were first called to Brown and Bell's home in the 4300 block of Crozier Street late Wednesday after the initial domestic dispute.

Bell told Dallasnews.com that the couple pulled up in front of the property where the man began beating the woman, at one point slamming her onto a car parked in the driveway.

Bell said the woman was begging for help so she, her brother and Brown asked the man to leave and told the woman she could stay.

However, the man forced her back in the car.

In a bid to stop him driving off with the woman, Bell's brother then punched the man's he said.

However, the assault enraged the beaten woman who shouted that they'd be back to 'settle things,' Bell recalls.

Police arrived soon after the couple drove off but the officers left the scene before they returned and gun fire rang out.

Bell said, the couple came back about 1:30 a.m. with two more people and began shooting at the house and car.

Bullets struck the family's living room and the couple's son's bedroom.

Struck through the walls: Tragically, Brown was in the living room and was hit by shots that pierced the living room wall. He was taken to Baylor University Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said

Bell and her son were uninjured as they were hiding under a bed and another toddler who was in a different bedroom also escaped without harm.

Police have not yet identified the couple or made any arrests in the case though the shooting remains under investigation.

According to Dallasnews.com, Bell told police a camera across the street may have recorded the fight and shooting but it's unclear if this is the case or if footage turned up any leads.
