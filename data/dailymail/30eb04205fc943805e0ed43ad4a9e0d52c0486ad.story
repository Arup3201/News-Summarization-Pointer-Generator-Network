It wasn’t long ago that monitoring our health meant using an old fashioned thermometer to check for a fever.

But the past year has seen hundreds of health and fitness trackers come on the market claiming to monitor everything from how much exercise we do, to what we eat.

Now one San Diego-based company is hoping go a step further by allowing people to run full health diagnostics on a molecular level using their blood and saliva, all from the comfort of their own home.

Consumers can use the Cue (left) to track five key health indicators: inflammation, vitamin D, fertility, influenza, and testosterone in just minutes in the comfort of their home using an app on their smartphone (right)

Cue has created a smartphone accessory of the same name which can analyse a user's blood and saliva on-the-go, and instantly display their health results on screen.

For the first time, Cue said people will be able to track five key health and lifestyle indicators: inflammation, vitamin D, fertility, influenza, and testosterone, in just minutes in the comfort of their home.

For instance, the Cue device can help people catch the symptoms of flu and treat them before they develop. 

The company claims it is also a helpful gadget for women hoping to conceive as it tracks their fertility levels

Cue comes with a wand (right) which collects a sample of saliva, blood, or a nasal swab, which then slides into a cartridge (left). The device examines the sample, before sending it to an app on the user’s smartphone

The company claims it is also a helpful gadget for women hoping to conceive because it tracks fertility levels.

Cue comes with a wand that collects a sample of saliva, blood, or a nasal swab. This is then slid into a cartridge.

The technology converts a biological sample to an electrical signal to create a digital result.

Chief executive, Ayub Khattak, said he wanted to create a product that allows people to access important information about their bodies whenever and wherever they want.

'We’ve used some time-tested basics, so the things that you find in the lab right now - in particular antibody based, very specific targeting of molecules,' Khattak told Techcrunch.

'That’s how tests are run today at the lab.

'What we’ve done is we’ve taken that concept - that fundamental principle - and we’ve used biosensors and microfluidics to make it so that we can execute those basics in a very compact, very automated way. 

'So what we did is we developed the microfluid technology and the biosensor technology and integrated those together to execute those fundamentals.' 

The technology converts a biological sample to an electrical signal to create a digital result. Cue is just three inches tall (7.6cm), weighs less than a pound (0.45kg), and has an optional travel case

The first 1,000 people can order Cue from the website for $149 (£88). However, the device won’t be shipped until spring next year and the final retail price has not been announced

The device, which took four years to develop, is just three inches tall (7.6cm), weighs less than a pound (0.45kg), and has an optional travel case.

‘Over time, having on-demand access to important indicators of health could reshape the way we, as a society respond to a pandemic and how healthy we live our lives for ourselves and our loved ones,’ the company claims on their website.

It is not designed to replace doctors and nurses completely, however.
