When a group of people heard a rumour that the new Kmart store was giving away free gift vouchers for the first 50 shoppers, they jumped at every opportunity to camp overnight in a bid to not miss out.

But after 14 hours of queuing in wet weather and peeing into bottles, three nursing students were left feeling disappointed only to be given five dollar vouchers.

NorthTec students Lee Howard-Mizsey, Izzy Cooke and Ashleigh Ingham slept outside the retailer chain ahead of the official opening at the Okara Shopping Centre in Whangarei in New Zealand on Wednesday night.

Ms Howard-Mizsey, who arrived at the store at 7pm, even brought her laptop along to finish off an assessment that was due the following day.

'There were a few showers too overnight and it was cold at 2am, but we were cosy enough,' Ms Howard-Mizsey told Northern Advocate.

By 11pm,  nine people rocked up after hearing the same rumours about the gift voucher freebies.

But when the 90 shoppers rushed through the doors as it opened at 7.30am, the three women were handed two five dollar vouchers to share between them.

'That was disappointing. We camped out for 14 hours. We had to pee into a bottle,' Ms Howard-Mizsey said.

Despite their brave cold temperatures to camp overnight, Ms Howard-Mizsey said it was still a good experience.

'We had fun. I'd do it all again,' she said.
