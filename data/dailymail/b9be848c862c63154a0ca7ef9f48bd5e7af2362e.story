The recent downpours and floods have caused havoc across the country for drivers and homeowners.

But three unlikely victims of wet weather are these adorable baby otters after they were separated from their mother during a storm.

The trio were discovered in a garden in North Yorkshire by a stunned homeowner who contacted animal charities about their welfare. 

Seeing triple: Three seven-week-old otter cubs, that are yet to be named, were rescued after being separated from their mother in recent floods

New home: The trio are now recovering at the Chestnut Conservation Centre, Otter and Owl Park in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire

Despite these semi-aquatic creatures loving the rain, they couldn't survive without their mother and were taken in by the Chestnut Conservation Centre, Otter and Owl Park in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire.

The otter cubs - now seven weeks old - will stay at the sanctuary for at least a year so they can be fully grown before being released into the wild.

Cuddles! The three otter cubs will now be kept at the conservation centre for at least a year before they are fully grown and can be released into the wild

Stuck in a tricky situation: The otter cubs would not have been able to survive by themselves in the wild

The Chestnut Conservation Centre was founded in 1984 by the Heap family who also own New Forest Wildlife Park in  Hampshire and Battersea Park Children's Zoo in London.

The Wildlife Park boasts Europe's largest groups of multi-specied otters, owls and other indigenous wildlife.

As well as otters, the centre also has pine martens, polecats, red foxes, Scottish wildcats and deer.

Perfect surroundings: The otters are just three of many at the Chestnut Conservation Centre which has the largest group of multi-specied otters in Europe
