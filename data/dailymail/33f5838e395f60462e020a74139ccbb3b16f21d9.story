A family has been left devastated following the death of their newborn baby  after she contracted a herpes virus from coming in contact with someone with a cold sore.

Eloise Lampton, who was born healthily on November 1 via caesarean at Mackay Hospital in far north Queensland, died last week in the arms of her parents Sarah Pugh, 28, and Douglas Lampton, 35.

The 24-day-old baby had been unknowingly infected with the herpes simplex virus while she was still in hospital in the days following her birth.

'Doctors initially thought it was a feeding issue. When we came home she just wanted to sleep... she wasn't a crying baby,' Ms Pugh told Daily Mail Australia.

But Eloise lost almost a kilo in the week after her birth and her health started to deteriorate quickly.

She was taken to Brisbane's Mater Hospital and was placed on a machine to keep her alive as doctors scrambled to find out what was wrong.

'It all happened so quickly, like within hours. She was in the hospital and we thought she was fine, then that night we were told she might not survive the night,' Ms Pugh said.

'The machine fully took over her whole body. It went into her arteries to pump blood. It took over her organs to let her little body have a rest.

'Everyday we'd go in there and it was devastating to see her like that. It was heartbreaking. 

'She was fully sedated but we'd touch her and she'd try and hold our hand. We'd have to put lip balm on her lips and she'd move them.' 

Doctors informed Eloise's parents, who have three other children, that it was the herpes virus causing their daughter's illness after two days on the machine.

'I was shocked. I was devastated to know she was born healthy and then this happened,' Ms Pugh said.

'They thought it could have come from me, but I didn't test positive to the disease. It was passed on through a cold sore. You have to be in contact – kissed or touched. We didn't have any visitors at hospital. It could have been from anyone.'

Eloise caught a staph infection in her blood while she was hooked up to the machine and doctors informed her parents there was nothing more they could do

Eloise's parents held out hope their baby would recover, but when she caught a staph infection in her blood doctors said their was nothing more they could do.

'Eloise had a very large legion on her brain, her organs had shut down and they couldn't be sure how she would recover again,' Ms Pugh said. 

'She fought right until the end. Five times in one week I was told she wouldn't have made it. Every time she would pull through. She defied the odds. She put up a very good fight.

Her parents said despite her illness, the newborn fought right until very end of her short life

Ms Pugh hopes Eloise's death will help others to be more aware of the herpes virus and how it can effect newborn babies

'They took the tubes out of her and we got to nurse her until she passed away. It was lovely to nurse her in that time.'

Ms Pugh hopes Eloise's death will help others to be more aware of the herpes virus and how it can effect newborn babies. 

'Sometimes you don't even know when you've got a cold sore. You never know what's going to happen,' she said. 

'It's not just cold sores. Any virus could do this to a baby.'
