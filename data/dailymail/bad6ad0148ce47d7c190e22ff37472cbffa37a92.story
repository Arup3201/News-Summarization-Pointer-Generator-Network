Not that it was the slightest secret, Chelsea forward Oscar has reason to be a happy lad at present.

On the pitch, the Brazilian is in fine form with his club is sitting pretty atop the Premier League table. 

Off it, the 23-year-old is blissfully happy in London with his childhood sweetheart wife Ludmila - see the image he posted on his Twitter profile on Sunday as evidence.

'With my little princess,' Oscar tweeted with this image of five-month-old daughter Julia just hours after helping Chelsea beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield on Saturday

On Sunday, after defeating Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield the day before, the winger shared a picture of himself and Ludmila with beaming grins and the simplest of messages, 'Bom dia !! Good morning !!', to his 2.03 million Twitter followers.

The night before, hours after featuring in Chelsea's victory, he posed for social media while doting on the other love of his life, five-month-old Julia, who was born in Brazil shortly before the World Cup. Oscar looked comfortable as he sat nursing his tot and fed her a bottle. 

He wrote again in English and Portuguese: 'Com a minha princesa!!! With my little princess!!!'

The £70,000-a-week star has four goals from his 15 appearances for the Blues so far this campaign forming part of one of the most formidable midfields in world football.

After Saturday's win at Anfield Jose Mourinho's side is four points clear of Southampton in second, with Manchester City - who drew at QPR - another four points adrift going into the international break.

With the majority of the Chelsea squad heading off to play for their national sides, Oscar, Willian and Ramires (though he's an injury doubt) will join up with the Brazil squad for friendlies against Turkey (Wednesday) and Austria (November  18).
