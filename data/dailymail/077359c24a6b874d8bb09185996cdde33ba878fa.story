Patricia Krentcil, the New Jersey woman dubbed 'tanning mom', has demanded that the media 'leave her family alone' - during a TV interview.

The 44-year-old made the appearance to defend her reputation as a good mother after she allegedly took her five-year-old daughter to a tanning salon last month.

She had posed provocatively wearing a skin-tight orange bandage skirt and fitted white cardigan that revealed her midriff outside her home in Nutley, New Jersey last week.

She then proceeded to pose for the cameras before her teenage daughter eventually forced her to go back inside and stop talking to the press.

She also hitched up her skirt to reveal her underwear to photographers while out with a friend.

The mother-of-five told the Today show: 'Every allegation was completely wrong and I just want people to leave us alone.

'And Iâ€™m sorry I'm tan. I can be tan; it just feels good. But I really think that these moms and dads or whoever, need to step off and step away.'

She went on to say that her five children were angry that the public was picking on their mother because of her bronzed appearance.

Since accusations surfaced that she had taken her fair-skinned, red-haired daughter to a tanning booth - leaving her severely burned - Krentcil has appeared to enjoy her time in the limelight, contrary to her pleas.

She has also managing to maintain her dark complexion despite being banned from a string of tanning salons near her home.

According to reports, eight Planet Sun Tanning Salon locations have posted pictures of the tanning mom in their salons so staff can recognize her and kick her out.

The salon where she is alleged to have taken her young daughter - City Tropics Tanning - is set to be inspected by the New Jersey Department of Health in the near future.

The leathery mom made her first appearance on the Today Show last week, where she sported a shockingly dark tan and claimed: 'This whole thing has been blown out of proportion.'

Days later, she was seen watering her garden in a skimpy out - making obscene signs at the waiting press and attempting to douse them with water.

She popped her head through her home's window to sneer at those below and stopped to chat during a shopping trip in Target.

And, in a sign she has really caught the nation's attention, she was the subject of a Saturday Night Live sketch and played by actress Kristen Wiig.

Wiig plastered herself in fake tan and was wearing a tight leather jacket and white flowery headpiece to mimic the New Jersey woman's look.

Smoke billowing around her, she said: 'Sorry about all the smoke. I just came from the tanning salon.'

The faux Krentcil said that tanning should only be done by 'responsible adults'. 'Because you may not know this, some people over tan,' she said to laughs from the audience.

The sketch went on to highlight the real-life Krentcil's comments that people who judge her for her tanning are fat, ugly and jealous.

Wiig said: 'I can't blame them for being jealous. I am alluring in a way they'll never be. Trust me, there are plenty of men in New Jersey who would love to snap into this Slim Jim.'

Krentcil told the New York Post she watched the three-minute comedy sketch and found it 'hysterical'. 'It was well done,' she said.

The nation's obsession with Tanning Mom began when Krentcil's five-year-old daughter's teacher called authorities after she noticed the girl had painful burns when she arrived at school.

Krentcil said that while she did take her daughter Anna to the tanning salon, the little girl never got in the booth and was only there waiting for her mother to finish her session.

She instead argued that Anna got her sunburn from playing in the yard and not breaking the law. Doctors say tanning booths, which emit UV radiation, are known carcinogens.

Krentcil's daughter apparently received enough of the radiation to burn her skin and leave her with painful damage, police said.

Her attorney, John Caruso, disagrees and said that Krentcil will be exonerated as the evidence will show the child never entered the booth.

'Forget about the presumption of innocence; my client is 150 per cent innocent,' Caruso said.

'She loves that child more than her whole life. She would never allow her child to go inside a tanning bed.'

Krentcil is due back in court on June 4.
