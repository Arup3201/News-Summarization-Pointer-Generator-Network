Australian model Miranda Kerr has often spoken about how close she is to her family, especially her 77-year-old grandmother Ann.

Last
 year the 30-year-old clotheshorse revealed that her glamorous gran had given 
her tips on how to keep a man happy, including wearing make-up each day 
and dressing in nice underwear.

And
 now the mother-of-one has cited the senior as one of her greatest style
 inspirations in an interview with brand new fashion magazine Clique.

As the first cover star of the 
shoppable magazine Miranda shared some of her wardrobe secrets and 
explained that the girlie dressing–up side of fashion that she loves so 
much can be traced back to her childhood.

She said: ‘My grandma has great style and really influenced
 me. The one thing that stayed with me was that fashion doesn’t need to 
be expensive or complicated – just worn with grace and confidence.’

Miranda posed with her grandmother and mother in a shoot for Australian magazine Women's Weekly last year and said: 'Mum and Nan are two of the strongest women I know and they are a great source of strength in my life'

Now Miranda 
is a mother too, and admits that her 2-year-old son Flynn is the love of
 her life.

She told Clique: 'My son is the best thing that ever happened
 to me. My favourite times are when we sit and laugh. Flynn has the most
 infectious laugh.

‘Since 
becoming a mother, I’ve re-evaluated my priorities and scheduled my work
 more efficiently to ensure my son is now my priority. When I get home 
after work or have a day off, I make a concerted effort to switch off 
and be present in the moment with him.’

And
 although she continues to top best-dressed lists the brunette claims 
that being a working mother has affected her wardrobe: 'My style has 
definitely become a little more relaxed,’ she says. ‘Two-year-olds keep 
you very busy so my collection of flat shoes is definitely growing.’
