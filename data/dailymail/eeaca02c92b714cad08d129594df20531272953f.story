A Chicago local morning show apologized to its unhappy viewers in a  promo  - and called itself 'the highest rated morning show that nobody f#@king likes.'

'WGN Morning News' aired complaints viewers purportedly submitted in its Monday promo.

Anchor Larry Potash walks through WGN's hallways as he says on tape 'In a phony world of cheering morning news anchors where ad-libbing is pretty harmless, there's one team that sucks the happy out of happy talk.'

No laughing matter? Local news anchor Larry Potash appeared in a promo for 'WGN Morning News,' which purportedly featured complaints submitted by viewers 

'But we're not for everybody,' he continues. 'We got this message from Kenny Aaron.

'"You're giggling like a moron at people's pain and ruin." Sorry, Kenny.'  

Potash, in another clip, then says 'And we got this message from Willma Heathers.

'She writes "I'll will never watch your station. I was disgusted by their behavior." Sorry, Willma.'

Potash, sitting in the newsroom, then reveals 'But our best message came from Anish Kapoor. 

'She writes "F#@k you. You guys suck in the morning. Nobody watches WGN."'

'WGN Morning News. The highest rated morning show that nobody f#@king likes,' he says.

After the promo is finished playing, a cut to the live broadcast shows Potash's fellow newscasters laughing and joking. 

Can't please everyone: One viewer said she was 'disgusted' with how the newscasters acted, while another said 'You're giggling like a moron' 

Potash addresses the camera, giving viewers a phone number and Facebook address to call in and complain even more.

'Go ahead and light it up,' he says. 'Get another promo in the works.'

WGN referred to the short clip as a promo in quotation marks on its website, and said '[...] we dare you not to laugh.'

The promo doesn't indicate which behavior from the WGN newscasters viewers specifically wrote in to complain about.

On Facebook, the promo has so far received 268 comments, most of them positive. 

'You guys are a breath of fresh air!! Love your show. Don't listen to those repressed stick in the muds,' one commenter wrote. 

Another said 'I love watching you guys! My mornings wouldn't be the same without your jokes! I'm glad your news isn't always bad news! You actually add humor to it. People have no sense of humor. #screwthosepeople #jokesonthem #bestnewschannel #wgn9morningnews.'

However, several viewers were displeased. One wrote on the Facebook page 'I can't stand wgn morning news..extremely annoying because they barely talk about real news or local traffic.' 

This isn't the first time 'WGN Morning News' created a humorous promo. 

Two years ago, Potash appeared in a clip poking fun at rival news stations, in which he said 'WGN. We put the "suck" in "succeed."' 

Well-received? After the promo finished playing, Potash gave viewers a phone number and Facebook address to call in and complain even more
