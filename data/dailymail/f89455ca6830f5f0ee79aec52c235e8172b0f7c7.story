Shakhtar Donetsk's win over Illychivets this weekend was routine, but Shakhtar striker Luiz Adriano will do well to remember it after a brutal clothesline left him out cold.

In a move more commonly seen in the wrestling ring, Illychivets's Oleksandr Chizhov was challenging for a 50/50 ball with Adriano, when his flailing arm caught the face of the Shakhtar forward and left him unconscious on the turf.

Immediately after the incident, Chizhov is seen desperately calling for medical attention when he realises Adriano is unconscious.

The referee deemed the incident a yellow-card offence, despite the fact Adriano would have been clear on goal had he gone past Chizhov.

Shakhtar doctors shortly after decided that Adriano was unfit to carry on, and the striker was substituted directly after the incident.

Shakhtar, who were 1-0 up at the time of the knock-out blow, went on to win 3-0 and maintained their 100% win record in the Ukrainian Premier League this season, scoring 13 and only conceding 1 goal.

Ouch: Adriano, after beating Chizhov to the ball, is caught by the Ukrainian's right arm

Clothesline: Adriano would have been through on goal had he not been hit

Out cold: The 27-year-old striker was left unconscious on the turf after the blow to his face

Attention: Chizhov, the referee, and various other players were quick to call for medical attention
