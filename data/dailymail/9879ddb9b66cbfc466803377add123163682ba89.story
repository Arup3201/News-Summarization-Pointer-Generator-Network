Police say the death of a 21-year-old Canadian woman whose body was found in a water tank on top of a downtown Los Angeles hotel on Tuesday may have been accidental.

Police have identified the victim as Elisa Lam, a student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was visiting California on her own before last seen at the Cecil Hotel, just outside Skid Row, on January 31.

Los Angeles Police detectives have characterized her disappearance as suspicious, notably how she got on the rooftop, but have refrained from calling it a homicide.

Tragic: Police have identified the body as Elisa Lam who disappeared on January 31 after taking a solo trip to Southern California from Canada

Found: Lam was found wedged in the water tank above the Cecil Hotel by a maintenance worker after guests complained of low water pressure

The hotel built in the 1920s but 
refurbished several years ago was the once occasional home to serial 
killers Richard Ramirez - nicknamed the Night Stalker - and Jack Unterweger responsible for the death of nine prostitutes in Europe and 
the U.S.

Police say there have been reports of continuing crime at the hotel.

Investigators are now working to determine whether foul play was involved in Lam's death with an autopsy scheduled for Thursday.

Law enforcement sources told the Los Angeles Times that a locked door and fire escape are the only ways to access the hotel's roof.

The door, which only employees can reach, is also equipped with an alarm that notifies hotel staff if someone is up there.

The water tank is also hard to access requiring authorities to work well into the afternoon to remove her body after a maintenance worker discovered it on Tuesday morning.

'The location of the water tanks is very small and configured in a very tight way so it's a little more difficult to get the body out,' said police spokeswoman Officer Sara Faden.

Stange behavior: A surveillance camera on the elevator at the Cecil captured Lam acting in a peculiar, paranoid wayÂ  the night she vanished

Lam stayed in touch with her friends and family while traveling in California - up until the day she disappeared.

A security video taken in an elevator
 at the hotel and released by the LAPD last week showed Lam acting 
strangely, hiding in a corner and repeatedly peering around the elevator
 doors into the hallway.

She never checked out of the hotel 
positioned on the outskirts of Skid Row and employees said they never 
saw her with anyone else.

Her body was discovered in one of 
four large water tanks after a maintenance worker went up to investigate
 reports of low water pressure, a Los Angeles police spokeswoman said.

Bernard Diaz, 89, who has lived at 
the Cecil for 32 years, told the LA Times that he heard a 'tremendous' 
racket on his floor above him the night Lam disappeared.

He said the floor also experience flooding that night.

'They said there was some obstruction to the drain between the third and fourth floor,' Mr Diaz told the Times.

Some two dozen firefighters could be 
seen cutting through one of the four large, cylindrical water tanks 
under a canopy that shielded them from news helicopters overhead.

Police have said that the reason for 
Lam's visit to Los Angeles was unclear, but that her final destination 
was expected to be Santa Cruz in central California.

She speaks Cantonese as well as English and was known to use public transportation such as trains and buses.
