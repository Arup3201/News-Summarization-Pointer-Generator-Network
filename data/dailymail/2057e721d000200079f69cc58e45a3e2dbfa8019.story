Workers will be referred for health assessments if they are sick for more than four weeks under a new government scheme.

GPs will be able to refer any worker who has been off sick or is expected to be absent in plans drawn up by the Department for Work and Pensions.

The service will assess how sick they are and draw up a plan to return them to health – and work - as soon as possible.

Costly: Up to 960,000 workers were on sick leave for more than a month each year between October 2010 and September 2013

It comes after the DWP revealed almost one million workers take at least one month off sick each year.

Up to 960,000 workers – one in every 25 employees - in Britain were on sick leave for more than a month each year between October 2010 and September 2013.

In means employers face a yearly bill of around £9 billion for sick pay and associated costs, with individuals missing out on £4 billion a year in lost earnings.

Under the new Health and Work Service scheme, assessments will carried out by occupational specialists to draw up a plan and timetable to get the patient back to work quickly. Employees will be referred by a GP or their employer but the assessments are not compulsory.

Those working in the public sector are among the groups most likely to take extended sick leave while those in London are the least likely, according to the official analysis of the scale of long-term sickness in the British economy.

Workers in the northeast are also among the groups most likely to take long periods of sick leave. Employees working for small companies are less likely to take long periods off than those with big employers.

fortune and is a needless waste of their hard-earned money.'

Taxpayers spend about £13 billion a 
year on sickness benefits and the Dwp estimates that sickness among 
working age people costs the economy around £100 billion a year.

The
 health assessment scheme is the latest move in the Government’s pledge 
to cut the country’s welfare bill after introducing new disability 
assessments and cutting benefits.

As part of the assessment, employees will be given a plan including a timetable for returning to work, fitness for work advice and signposted to appropriate help. An advice service on the internet and phone will also be available under the scheme.

The DWP believes the scheme, to be launched in England, Scotland and Wales, will save employers £70 million a year and cut the time people spend off work by 20 per cent to 40 per cent.

The new Health and Work Service will be funded by abolishing a compensation scheme for businesses paying long-term sick pay to their employees.

New scheme: In future, employees off sick for more than four weeks will be referred to an occupational specialists who will help devise a plan to get them back at work quicker

Any financial loss to business from 
the ending of the statutory sick pay percentage threshold scheme is 
expected to be offset by a reduction in lost working days, earlier 
return to work and increased economic output created by the new scheme, 
according to the Dwp.

Around
 300,000 people a year fall out of work and into the welfare system 
because of health-related issues, according to figures.

Mike Penning, the work and pensions 
minister, said: ‘More than 130 million days a year are lost to sickness 
absence in Great Britain, which has a substantial impact on workers, 
employers and taxpayers.

‘We are taking action to get people back into work. This is a triple win. It will mean more people with a job, reduced cost for business and a more financially secure future.’

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Excessive days off cost taxpayers a fortune and is a needless waste of their hard-earned money.

‘It’s time to combat a culture that allows this startling and unjustified difference between workplaces to continue unchallenged .’

The government is trying to reduce long-term sickness at work in an attempt to cut the 300,000 who move out of work on to benefits every year because of health problems.

The move by Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, follows his introduction of tests to determine whether sickness claimants are fit enough to work.

According to the Dwp, this controversial move has contributed to nearly 250,000 people coming off incapacity benefits since 2010.

The work capability assessments have not passed without controversy. One 39-year-old woman from Livingston, near Edinburgh, was judged fit to work just weeks before she died.

A heart and lung transplant patient from Essex died nine days after being declared well enough for employment.
