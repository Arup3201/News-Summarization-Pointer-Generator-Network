A BBC presenter has vented his fury at the corporation in an on-air outburst after he was kicked off his popular morning show because he is engaged to the local Tory MP. 

BBC Radio Bristol presenter John Darvall, 48, and MP Charlotte Leslie, 36, began dating in October and got engaged just two months later.

But the radio DJ has been ousted from his mid-morning show and moved to a less news-based afternoon slot in the run-up to polling day, as she is standing for re-election.

BBC bosses insist it is due to 'heightened sensitivities' and to avoid accusations of a conflict of interest, and the father-of-four will be back after May.

But during one of his final shows, the twice-divorced presenter vented his frustration at the corporation and suggested he might not be allowed back even after the election.

Speaking to a caller during a phone-in to discuss Jeremy Clarkson's sacking from the BBC, Mr Darvall said: 'Trust me I have a lot of reasons myself to be angry with the BBC at the moment.'

Later, when a caller suggested he should apply to replace the controversial Top Gear presenter, he joked: 'I am coming off this programme tomorrow, so I might consider something of a career departure.'

Questioned by another caller, he added: 'It's to do with the election and protecting BBC impartiality. It's not my decision.

'I'm honouring what the BBC have asked me to do and I sincerely hope to be back after the general election, and the BBC have sort of said that I might possibly be, barring any unforeseen circumstances.

'A true BBC management meeting.'

Bristol MP Leslie - voted the sexiest woman in politics - met John when she first went on his show four years ago.

They began dating in October, he proposed on Christmas Day, and they officially announced their engagement last month.

BBC bosses immediately said he would have to move to an afternoon show because his fiancee is standing for re-election.

Mr Darvall - who joined the show in 2011 - remained silent on his move until he got frustrated during a call-in this week, and his last morning show until after the election was yesterday.

Speaking after her fiance's on-air rant, Leslie said he had 'always been completely professional and impartial'.

The MP for Bristol North West said: 'It would be extraordinary if he were not allowed to return to his programme after the General Election, and I fully expect he will be.

'John has always been completely professional and impartial and I understand this is being done to protect him and the BBC for the few weeks of the final election period.

'It would be extraordinary if he were not allowed to return to his programme after the General Election, and I fully expect he will be.'

The BBC said the arrangement was to avoid any perception of a 'conflict of interest' and said it would continue until after the general election

A BBC spokesperson said: 'We have every confidence in the professionalism and impartiality of all our presenters and staff, but given the heightened sensitivities of an election period John Darvall will move from the Mid-morning Show to present the Afternoon Show on BBC Radio Bristol.

'This is to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest and the arrangement will continue until after the General Election.'

Announcing their engagement last month, Leslie said his proposal was 'completely natural and lovely' and that the presenter often grilled her on her views.

The term comes from the Urdu (parda) and Persian (pardah) word meaning veil or curtain.

‘Purdah’ refers to the period between the dissolution of Parliament and polling day. 

The Cabinet Office issue guidance for Ministers and civil servants on the handling of Government business designed to ensure that no party or candidate uses their position for electoral advantage during this period.

The BBC has produced its own 20 page document of 'election guidelines' for its staff in the run-up to polling day.

They say: 'There is no area of broadcasting where the BBC’s commitment to due impartiality is more closely scrutinised than in reporting election campaigns.'

Under the requirements of the organisations Charter Agreement of 2006 it must ensure that political issues are covered with due accuracy and impartiality.

It states: 'In all elections, the BBC must take care to prevent candidates being given an unfair advantage.'

BBC editorial staff are also warned that anyone involved in producing election-related content must avoid compromising the BBC’s impartiality or bringing the BBC into disrepute by their activities, such as by expressing their own views on political matters, either on personal websites or social media.

She said: 'We have known each other since 2011, when he started interviewing me.

'He's always given me quite a tough time, as he's a robust interviewer. I always enjoyed it because there was always a lot of banter.

'I like the fact that we don't agree and if I ever get too Tory-Tory, he'll bash me. He'll dissect my arguments, and I enjoy being challenged.

'My parents always said you could tell we got on well on air. He came for tea and that was it.'
