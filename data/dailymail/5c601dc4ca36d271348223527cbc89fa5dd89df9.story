Children born in the summer should be allowed to start school later in the year if they struggle with lessons, an education minister has admitted.

Nick Gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom, telling councils and headteachers to do 'what's in the best interests of the child'.

It follows warnings from campaigners that some local authorities made it difficult for families who want to put off joining reception classes, raising the prospect of 250,000 children having to start in Year 1.

The Department for Education issued guidance to schools and councils in July 2013 and last December making it clear that there is no rule stating that a child has to be in the right school cohort for their age group.

Summer-born children can wait until the September after their fifth birthday if their parents feel they need more time to develop.

And it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be 'no barrier' to the child then starting in reception class.

The rule was introduced after research showed they were more likely to struggle at school, do worse in exams and have less chance of getting into university.

But some councils are still sending youngsters straight into Year 1 if their parents hold them back unless they can prove there were 'exceptional' circumstances.

In one high profile case, mother Rosie Dutton is fighting for her daughter to be allowed into reception class at school a year later after she decided to delay her education because she only turned four a few weeks before school started.

Department for Education guidance allows parents to delay their child's schooling until the September after their fifth birthday.

This policy, updated last spring, is designed to help children with birthdays between April 1 and August 31.

This is because because experts believe they are more likely to struggle academically if they start school after just turning four.

The Department for Education guidance says: ‘An increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents, local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer-born child to start school.

'There are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class'.

But some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into Year 1 to ease pressure on places in reception.

Bracknell Forest Council says: ‘If you choose for your child not to start until their statutory school age... starting in a Reception class following a child’s fifth birthday is only possible in exceptional circumstances.’ 

Reading Borough Council warns: ‘You will need to apply for a place in Year 1. 

‘However, the school may then be full because the places have been allocated to children in the previous school year.’

Olivia Dutton, from Staffordshire, was due to start primary school last September, weeks after her fourth birthday, but her parents decided to exercise their right to delay the start of her school life by 12 months.

Mrs Dutton believes her daughter was 'not ready for school', and is furious her local council is now considering sending her straight into Year 1 because she was held back.  

Now she is fighting to allow Olivia to start in the reception class, and will hear if she has been successful in April.

Mr Gibb told MPs that there had to be 'flexibility' from schools and councils when agreeing the start date for children who turn four just weeks before the start of the school year.

Giving evidence to the education select committee, he said: 'The key thing is flexibility, and I think that admissions authorities and headteachers do need to do what's in the best interests of the child.'

He added: 'If a child is very immature for their age and they are born in those summer months, and it's the very strongly held view of the parents that the child should start school in the following September, which is when the law says they should start, I think admissions authorities should be flexible and should do what's in the best interests of the child.'

He stressed that councils mist include parents in discussions about when their children start school.

But Michelle Melson, of the Summer Born Campaign, claimed that problems in arranging different school start times have worsened

She told the committee: 'We do have a compulsory school age in England, so children should be able to start at compulsory school age.'

She added that summer-born babies who do start school after they are five are starting at compulsory starting age and should not miss out on reception by being placed straight into Year 1.

'Parents are being forced to enrol their child in school early, prior to compulsory school age, in order to have a reasonable chance of getting a place in their preferred schools.'
