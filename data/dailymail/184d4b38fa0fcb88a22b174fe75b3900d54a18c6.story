The NHS is 'pulling out all the stops' to deal with the impact of bad weather, flu and the winter vomiting bug, leaders have confirmed.

In a desperate attempt to avoid the chaos of last winter, more staff are being hired and several thousand more beds and GP appointments have been created.

Some hospitals are re-opening old wards, some are building new ones and one has even gone as far as reserving a prefab building if all else fails.

There are fears that the health service may fail to cope with the fallout from winter weather – and some trusts, determined to avoid a crisis, have been running their winter strategies for the past two months, the Guardian reported.

While A&E departments see fewer patients in the winter, research shows they are more likely to be admitted.

And as admissions soar, beds become full, operations are cancelled and staff struggle to move people on from A&E.

In a bid to deal with the predicted influx of patients as best as possible, trusts are recruiting nurses from abroad to tackle staff shortages so they can cope with the expected impact of norovius (the winter vomiting bug), flu and the fall-out of the bad weather

 England deputy chief executive Dame Barbara Hakin said that despite hospitals already being busy – some have been running their winter strategy since September – she was ‘not complacent.

Success: NHS England deputy chief executive Dame Barbara Hakin said that A&E staff have been seeing and treating patients who weren't admitted 'in under two hours'

She added that A&E staff have been seeing and treating patients who weren’t admitted ‘in under two hours’.

According to The Guardian, in Leeds, St James's hospital and Leeds General Infirmary will get another 65 beds, with 14 more on standby.

There had also been plans for even more expansion – but this was hampered as not enough nurses could be recruited. Instead, doctors will work longer hours.

Other trusts are turning to nursing homes to plug the supply gap.  County Durham and Darlington NHS foundation trust has arranged for 10 patients who need rehabilitation rather than treatment to be cared for in a home, to free up hospital beds.

In the Cheltenham and Gloucester area, hospitals have recruited 35 Portuguese nurses and opened two more wards at the trust that runs Cheltenham General Hospital.

‘In the middle of winter we can see an extra ward of patients coming in on any day,' its chief executive, Frank Harsent, told the newspaper. He admitted he wants to avoid a re-run of last year's ‘difficult’ winter.

And at the University Hospital of North Durham, extra ‘temporary’ beds created last winter have remained in existence ever since due to ‘all-year-round pressures’, bosses said.

Last week NHS England confirmed that 
£150m will be taken from its expected surplus to ease winter pressures 
on A&E departments this year. This is on top of an additional £250m 
given earlier in the year.

Dame Barbara told the Health 
Service Journal: ‘Last winter was a tough one for the NHS so this year 
we started preparing earlier than ever before, with an extra £250m given
 to those local systems in greatest need to support them over winter.

‘To
 support those systems not deemed most at risk, NHS England will be 
distributing a further £150m to help them maintain services and reduce 
the pressure on A&Es caused by cold weather.'

Overwhelmed: Hospitals are expecting an influx of patients suffering from norovius (the winter vomiting bug), flu and the fall-out of the bad weather

But
 experts warn that even this won’t be enough to stop a crisis. The 
medical director of one trust told the magazine recently that despite 
the extra £400m: ‘It's all going to go completely pear-shaped and they 
know it. It's entirely predictable.’

Chris Hopson, chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network, which represents almost all England's acute hospitals, said: ‘Everything that can be done for this winter is being attempted on the frontline.

'Trusts have been putting more money into meeting this demand by recruiting more staff, buying extra equipment, building and extending wards and emergency units and improving links and working arrangements between community, mental health, ambulance and hospital teams.’

Every trust is expected to vaccinate at least 75 per cent of their staff against the flu this year.
