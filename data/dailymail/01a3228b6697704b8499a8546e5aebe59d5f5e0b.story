With perfect precision, this spear fisherman leaps into the air in a spectacular display of a bizarre spear hunting technique.

The fisherman shows off his incredible skill on the Loyalty Islands Province in New Caledonia where the sea clan live almost entirely on fish and other sea creatures.

However, despite the odd way of catching his food, fisherman Albert is just showing a normal way of life on the islands in the south west Pacific Ocean.

Photographer Stephane Ducandas, 41, who also lives on the islands, said be believes the fishing technique is unique.

He
 said: ‘I have never seen this type of fishing anywhere else. In New 
Caledonia, some prawn fisherman use Assegai (a spear or pole-type 
weapon).

‘But jumping like this with that incredible precision was absolutely amazing and typical of Loyalty Island.’

Mr Ducandas used a camera with special underwater equipment to capture the incredible moments.

He
 said: ‘This is the kind of subject that most interests me 
photographically. It's all about the moment - one special light, one 
special relationship between one person and myself.

‘I'm
 most interested in photographing human stories and lives. When I meet 
with someone, I share his world, his job, his family and his life before
 I get out the camera.’
