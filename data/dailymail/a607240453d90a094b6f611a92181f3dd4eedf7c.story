A Mafia don who has spent 20 years hiding in Britain cannot be deported to Italy because cramped prison conditions would breach his human rights, a judge ruled yesterday.

Domenico Rancadore has been living quietly in a London suburb since 1994 despite being sentenced to seven years in jail in his home country for running a branch of the Mafia involved in extortion, racketeering and drug trafficking.

But yesterday, Senior District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that Rancadore – one of Italy’s most wanted men – cannot be extradited due to a European Court of Human Rights ruling upheld in the High Court last week that chronic overcrowding in Italian jails breaches human rights laws.

Ncknamed 'The Professor', he was sentenced to seven years prison in Italy in 1999 in absence for his role as 'a man of honour' in the Cosa Nostra

Mr Rancadore used a bag containing files and books to shield his face, while his wife walked beside him with her face covered by a scarf

At Westminster magistrates’ court, 
Judge Riddle said he had planned to deport the feared 65-year-old 
because he was satisfied the fugitive’s extradition was ‘compatible with
 the defendant’s Convention rights, including prison conditions’.

But
 his hands were tied by a High Court ruling last week when judges 
decided a Somalian businessman accused of unauthorised financial 
activity could not be sent to Italy due to a Strasbourg judgment that 
Italian prisons violated Article 3 of the Human Rights Act that prevents
 torture, inhuman or degrading treatment.

Yesterday
 critics expressed astonishment. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the 
Centre for Crime Prevention think tank, said: ‘These rulings and our 
soft justice system only encourage foreign terrorists and criminals to 
travel to Britain.’

Tory MP
 Dominic Raab said: ‘It shows what a shambles EU law is in this area. We
 have innocent British citizens being carted off under the European 
Arrest Warrant to face flawed justice systems or gruesome jails abroad. 
But we can’t send foreign gangsters back home.’

Prosecutor
 Benjamin Seifert had told the court how Rancadore was sentenced in his 
absence to seven years in prison in Italy in 1999.

He fled to Britain in 1994 and was living as a celebrity chauffeur under the name Marc Skinner - the maiden name of his wife's mother - with his wife and two children

He has now returned home on bail after a judge at Westminster Magistrates ruled his extradition to Italy should be blocked

He will be electronically tagged and a curfew was set between 10am and 2pm and again between 10pm and 2am

He
 said: ‘Mr Rancadore was one of the heads of an armed criminal 
organisation known as Cosa Nostra which is said to be one of the most 
powerful Mafia organisations in Italy, made up of thousands of members 
spreading terror in Sicily by imposing its rules and controlling the 
area and systematically murdering anybody who did not comply with the 
will of the members of the organisation.’

But
 to the surprise of Italian police who had been hunting for him since 
1994, Rancadore was living in a bungalow in Uxbridge with his wife and 
two children until he was arrested last August by Scotland Yard.

Yesterday
 Judge Riddle said he was satisfied by assurances from the Italian 
Ministry of Justice that Rancadore would not be held in an overcrowded 
cell if he were to be sent back to face justice.

But
 last week Lord Justice McCombe and Mr Justice Hickinbottom ruled in a 
separate case that in the face of ‘a systemic failure of a state’s 
prison system’, assurances given by Italian authorities were 
insufficient to persuade them that there was no risk prison conditions 
would breach human rights.

Judge
 Riddle said: ‘The judgment of the [High] court is binding on me. For 
these reasons Mr Rancadore is discharged.’ The Italian authorities now 
have the right to appeal the decision.

After
 seven months in custody, Rancadore – said to have a serious heart 
condition – was bailed on a £20,000 surety and told to report to 
Uxbridge police station daily.

His wife said: ‘He’s happy to be home. This isn’t finished yet. This is just the beginning, isn’t it.’

Rancadore’s
 solicitor, Karen Todner, said: ‘Mr Rancadore has been very 
misrepresented in the Press thus far. He made a deliberate decision 20 
years ago to walk away from the Mafia and all that is associated with 
it. He has led a blame-free existence in the United Kingdom.’

Mafia fugitive Domenico Rancadore, 65, has won his battle against extradition back to Italy

For 20 years, he lived quietly in a modest bungalow in a west London suburb, attracting little notice from his neighbours who knew him as Marc Skinner, a ‘reserved and polite’ father of two.

But back in his home country, Domenico Rancadore’s name inspired terror in the hearts of his victims, who described him as the mob godfather running one of the most  dangerous factions of the Mafia.

According to former prison chaplain Father Gino Sacchetti, Rancadore’s mob was responsible for a series of a sickening attacks in a campaign of intimidation including nailing a dead lamb to his front door, firebombing his car and posting bullets to him.

The priest was targeted in the late Eighties after he spoke out against organised crime in Sicily. He said: ‘I knew Rancadore was involved in the threats against me – he sent two local brothers to threaten me.’

The brothers were arrested but Rancadore was already on the run.

Father Sacchetti had angered mob bosses by refusing to sell prime land which they wanted to use for a luxury development, and they were further outraged when he said he would instead open a shelter for drug addicts on the outskirts of Palermo – the heartland of Rancadore and his henchmen.

A note sent with the bullets read: ‘The first is for your heart, the second for your head, the third for the coup de grace. This is your final warning.’

The 64-year-old, who is wanted to serve a seven-year jail term after he was convicted in 1999 of Mafia association and extortion in Trabia, near Palermo, was arrested on two European arrest warrants last August

The priest recalled: ‘I had the lamb 
nailed to my front door at the church where I worked. Rancadore was said
 to be behind it. It was a horrific sight – there was a note pinned to 
it which read “You will end up the same way”. They wanted to scare me 
but they were not going to put me off my work.’

Born in Palermo, Sicily, in 1949, Rancadore was the son of a Mafia boss called Giuseppe, who was later jailed for life.

He
 worked as a PE teacher and was fondly known as ‘the professor’ before 
turning to crime. Italian police say he was involved in the Mafia Wars 
of 30 years ago.

He was 
known as a ‘man of honour’ in the Cosa Nostra group which controlled the
 Trabia district of Palermo where it was said that he collected bribes 
from builders and was considered so powerful he enjoyed kickbacks on a 
government contract.

Mrs Skinner was born Anna Maria Culcasi Macaluso, the daughter of an Italian Consul, but changed her name by deed poll

Speaking with a perfect English accent, she told the court they had married in 1976 and had lived in Sicily, before coming to England in 2004

But
 fearing the net was closing in, he fled to Britain in 1994 to start a 
new life as a chauffeur driving celebrities in high-end Jaguar and 
Mercedes cars.

Rancadore
 told Westminster magistrates’ court that he came to the UK to give wife
 Anne, 60, the daughter of a former Italian consul to London, and their 
children Giuseppe, 36, and Daniela, 33, ‘a good life’ and avoid the 
stigma associated with his father’s name.

He
 was living under the radar, having adapted the name of his wife’s 
British mother in a ceremony undertaken by a priest. Investigators found
 no identity documents, no passport, national insurance, work records or
 driving licence in his name.
