West Ham are ready to offer Diafra Sakho an improved contract ahead of schedule.

Co-chairman David Sullivan, who was instrumental in signing the striker from Metz in the summer, has been delighted with the 24-year-old's outstanding start to his Upton Park career.

Sakho has scored seven goals in seven starts following his £3.5million move which was in the balance until Sullivan stepped in.

Although Sakho agreed a four year contract on around £20,000 a week when he joined in August, Sullivan wants to reward his form by revising the figures.

His performances have been such that France are exploring the possibility of calling him into their national squad even though he has already represented Senegal in a friendly.

Sakho came off with a shoulder injury on Saturday, after scoring the crucial second in West Ham's 2-1 win over champions Manchester City, however, he is hoping to be out for just two weeks with damaged cartilage in his shoulder joint as opposed to a month which was initially feared. It means he could return to face Everton on November 22.
