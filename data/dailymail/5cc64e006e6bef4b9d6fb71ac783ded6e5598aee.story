The Queen could be called in to decide who will be Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister - as the South Pacific nation descends into political chaos.

The island, which will be visited by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of 
Cornwall next year as part of the Queenâ€™s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, is currently deadlocked.

Two men are claiming to be in charge and their respective police chiefs are maintaining peace and refusing to get involved.

It comes after Sir Michael Somare, 76, was ousted from office by Peter O'Neill in August during the five months he was in Singapore undergoing a series of heart operations.

The Supreme Court and Governor-General Sir Michael Ogio has backed Somare. The Port Moresby court has ruled he was illegally removed from power. But lawmakers loyal to O'Neill have passed retroactive legislation recognising him as leader.

Therefore it could technically fall to Queen Elizabeth II, whose representative in the country is the Governor-General, to choose the Commonwealth country's new leader.

But that would only take place when an absolute majority of the Parliament votes to sack the Governor-General, after which Parliament must approach the Queen and ask her to dismiss him.

At a news conference yesterday, O'Neill said he had ordered police to take control of government offices, including the prime minister's office, where Somare and his followers were working. But O'Neill said he had no authority to issue arrest warrants for Somare or Somare's ministers.

As heavily armed police guarded state 
institutions, the police commissioner appointed by O'Neill, Tom Kulunga,
said last night there were no plans to remove Somare or his ministers 
from the buildings.

Kulunga declared the police force 
would remain neutral. He said: 'This is a political situation, this is 
not a police situation.'

Papua New Guinea is a Commonwealth country and the Governor-General is her representative.

It is technically possible that the Queen could be called on to break the deadlock.

But
that would only take place when an absolute majority of the Parliament 
votes to sack the Governor-General, after which Parliament must approach
the Queen and ask her to dismiss him.

Police Commissioner Fred Yakasa, who was 
appointed by Somare soon after the Supreme Court restored him to power, 
told The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper he agreed with Kulunga that 
police should remain independent of the politicians.

Somare's supporters had tried to flush
O'Neill's camp out of Parliament House, which they have occupied since 
the Supreme Court decision on Monday, by ordering that electricity and 
water to the building be cut.

But PNG Power chief executive Lawrence Solomon had refused to carry out the directive, the newspaper said.

Neither Solomon nor Somare was immediately available for comment on Friday.

'We
are sick and tired of the selfish behavior by our politicians,' said 
Michael Malabang, head of the country's Trade Union Congress, which 
represents tens of thousands of private and public sector workers across
Papua New Guinea, a former Australian territory rich in mineral 
resources.We don't want a total public service breakdown, and it is 
coming to that stage.'

The stand-off began on Monday, when the 
Supreme Court ruled that O'Neill's election by parliament in August was 
unconstitutional and said Somare should be reinstated as leader.

Lawmakers backing O'Neill stormed the gates of Ogio's official residence on Tuesday, demanding he meet with O'Neill.

Ogio,
who represents British Queen Elizabeth II - the country's head of state
- said he would decide by Wednesday who should be prime minister.

On
Wednesday, Ogio swore in Somare's Cabinet. Somare insisted he did not 
need to be sworn in, because the Supreme Court had already reinstated 
him as prime minister.

But a
majority of the country's 109 lawmakers voted later that day to suspend
Ogio and replace him temporarily with Speaker Jeffery Nape. Nape then 
swore O'Neill in as prime minister.

Somare
dismissed Ogio's suspension as corrupt. 'The only two people who can 
make a difference are Sir Michael and Mr O'Neill,' said Malabang, head 
of the trade union. 'They have to calm down and come together for the 
sake of our people.'

Somare spent five months in Singapore undergoing three heart operations before returning to parliament September 6.

Australia
shares an important trade relationship with Papua New Guinea, which is 
rich in mineral resources including oil, gold and copper, and crops such
as coffee and cocoa.

Australia
is Papua New Guinea's top export market, as well as its top source of 
imports. Papua New Guinea relies on Australia for fuel, food, cars and 
foreign aid.
