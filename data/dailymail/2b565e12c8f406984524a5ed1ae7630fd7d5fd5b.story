He has transported holidaymakers along Great Yarmouth seafront for 25 years, but now a horse-drawn carriage owner faces losing his business because he doesn't have a driving licence.

Fred England, 43, has operated on the historic beachfront in Norfolk since 1987 as part of a family tradition.

But Mr England is now set to lose his licence as council officials have suddenly realised
they should not be authorising him to drive his four-wheel 
carriage because he does not have a car licence.

Mr England, whose horse is called Sam, went to Great Yarmouth Borough Council last week to submit a licence renewal application, as he has done regularly for a quarter of a century.

But he was told he needed a motor vehicle driving licence, which he has never had.

He now faces an agonising wait over his working future with the final decision being taken by the council's licensing committee later this week.

The horseman said his grandfather, father and three brothers have all pulled tourists in carriages along the seafront since the Second World War.

Mr England of Great Yarmouth, said: 'They reckon I am not covered on the insurance.

'I have been doing this safely for 25 years - why all this all of a sudden now?

'In Blackpool there are eight guys who have been given special Grandfather Rights.

'They can ride without a licence as their family have been doing it for so long.

'Where are my Grandfather Rights?'

A Court of Appeal case in 1998 ruled that a person-drawn vehicle was within the definition of a 'Hackney Carriage' ' a black cab.

As a result it became law that both horse-drawn and person-drawn vehicles were licensable under Hackney Carriage legislation.

That means a landau rider must hold both a Hackney Carriage driver's licence and DVLA licence.

Linda Mockford, licensing manager at Great Yarmouth Borough Council, said: 'It just recently came to light that it's a matter of law, whereas before we did not require it.

'It was just a case of officers not being aware it was the law.

'It came to light because somebody else was trying to apply for a licence.

'We made it policy for brand new applications a few years ago.

'Now I know I have to rectify it. We have checked and found that we were potentially in breach.'

She insisted: 'We cannot do anything but refuse it - we are getting legal advice and I have advised him to do the same.Â 

'If there was something I could do for him I would,' she added.

'I will speak to him face to face - he deserves that after having been a landau driver for 25 years.'

But defiant Mr England retorted: 'As far as I am concerned this is their mistake, not mine.'
