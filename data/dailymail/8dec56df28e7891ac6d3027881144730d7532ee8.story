Ed Miliband today claims he is like Margaret Thatcher in an extraordinary attempt to prove he is up to the job of leading his party.

The Labour leader compares the Iron Lady’s grip on the challenges faced by Britain in the 1970s to his own ideas about how the country should be run.

But Tory former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said Mr Miliband has as much claim to the mantle of Baroness Thatcher as 'Silvio Berlusconi had to that of Julius Caesar'.

A succession of political leaders, including Tony Blair and David Cameron, have sought to portray themselves as the heir to Baroness Thatcher’s brand of conviction politics.

But as the son of a Marxist who advocates greater state intervention, Mr Miliband is probably the most unlikely.

In a documentary to be broadcast tonight – called ‘What Does Ed Miliband Really Think?’ – the Labour leader tries to draw parallels with his own struggle to appear relevant to 21st century Britain with Baroness Thatcher’s early stages as Tory leader.

Boris Johnson today urged David Cameron to 'put on that pineapple-coloured wig' and emulate Baroness Thatcher in his talks with the EU

‘She was a conviction politician and I think conviction really matters,’ Mr Miliband tells Radio 4. ‘I think that in the 1970s, it was a similar moment, and that is the biggest parallel.

'It was a similar moment in the sense that a sense of the old order was crumbling and it wasn’t 100 per cent clear what was going to replace it.

‘And the challenge of the future, of the next few years and indeed of the election, is who can rise to the scale of challenge that the country faces and who can create a project for how this country’s going to be run that is genuinely going to make our economy work, not just for a few people but much more widely.’

But Sir Malcolm was withering in his response: 'I understand Ed Miliband is trying to present himself as a conviction politician and latter-day reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher. 

'I do not know whether to laugh or cry.  Having served in Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet for four years, I recall a Prime Minister who despised politicians who try to be all things to all people.

'Mr Miliband appears to fall into that mould.  He has as much claim to the mantle of Margaret Thatcher as Silvio Berlusconi had to that of Julius Caesar.'

Mr Miliband was trying to expand on his vision for the country, but struggled to explain ideas like pre-distribution and predatory capitalism.

He said he did not yet have a full set of policies, but wanted a clear plan before the general election after seeing Gordn Brown flounder once he became PM.

'I learned some lessons,' he said of his time working with the former Labour Chancellor.

'I think that, when he became Prime Minister, he didn’t have a clear enough sense about how he wanted to take the country forward.

'And so I learned that lesson, and I’m not somebody who is going to go into the coming election not being clear about where I want to take the country afterwards.'

However, Mr Miliband may struggle to corner the market in Thatcherite conviction politics.

Today Boris Johnson urged David Cameron to assume the defiant positioning – and dress sense – of the former Tory PM in his dealings with Europe.

Mr Cameron is facing growing calls from his own own party to take a tough stance during talks this week on a seven-year budget deal for thew European Union.

Writing in his column in the Daily Telegraph today, Mr Johnson said: ‘It is time for David Cameron to put on that pineapple-coloured wig and powder blue suit, whirl his handbag round his head and bring it crashing to the table with the words no, non, nein, neen, nee, ne, ei and ochi, until they get the message.’
