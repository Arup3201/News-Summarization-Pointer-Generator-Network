Edward Snowden, the former government contractor behind the biggest security leak in U.S. history, has been pictured for a new magazine cover cradling the American flag to his cheek. 

The image of the 31-year-old hacker, who was recently granted another three years of asylum in Russia, has drawn strong opinions after it was published on Wednesday by Wired. 

Oliver Willis, a blogger for Media Matters, tweeted: 'He should be hugging the russian flag, or maybe putin himself.' 

Dan Gainor, a VP of Business and Culture for Media Research Center, posted: 'Snowden is both a whistle-blower AND traitor.Went out of his way to hurt US. This is BS. #wiki' 

Edward Snowden, pictured on the September issue of Wired, cradling the American flag. The former NSA contractor, who leaked classified documents, revealed that the NSA have developed a program called MonsterMind which can respond to cyber-attacks without human intervention 

Mr Gainor later added: 'Snowden went out of his way to warn US - good, then went out of his way to release material to harm US abroad, treasonous.' 

Miriam Elder, from Buzzfeed, described the article as an 'amazing read' but added: 'The greatness of the Snowden story is unfortunately matched by the ridiculousness of the cover photo.'

Stefania Maurizi, a journalist for Italian news publication, L'Espresso, described it as a 'must read'. 

The controversial shot was taken by Platon, one of the world's most highly-respected photographers, who previously snapped Valdimir Putin for a 2007 Time magazine cover.

Wired editor Scott Dadich revealed that Snowden had to think hard before posing for the shot.

Dadich wrote: 'He [Snowden] said he was nervous that posing with the flag might anger people but that it meant a lot to him. He said that he loved his country. He cradled the flag and held it close to his heart.'

The Stars and Stripes used for the Snowden shot also came with its own history. Dadich revealed that it was the same flag Platon had draped around a naked Pamela Anderson for a cover shot in 1998 for the now-defunct George magazine.

Snowden used the exclusive interview to reveal further government secrets about a secretive NSA cyber-attack program, MonsterMind, and to explain why he would volunteer to go to jail - but only under the right circumstances.

He told the magazine: 'I told the government I’d volunteer for prison, as long as it served the right purpose…I care more about the country than what happens to me.

'But we can’t allow the law to become a political weapon or agree to scare people away from standing up for their rights, no matter how good the deal. I’m not going to be part of that.' 

Snowden faces espionage charges in the U.S. that carry a sentence of up to 30 years but Russia has no extradition treaty with Washington. 

Snowden, the former government contractor who instigated the biggest leak of government documents in u.S. history, has been living in Moscow after seeking asylum from Russia 

 MonsterMind not only has the capability to detect incoming cyberattacks but can also counterattack - with no human intervention at all, according to Snowden. 

This could lead to catastroph because cyberattacks are often routed through computers in innocent third countries.

The 31-year-old told Wired: 'These attacks can be spoofed...You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?'  

Last year, the former systems analyst was granted temporary asylum of one year in Russia, but that expired on August 1. His lawyer said last week that he had been granted permission to stay in Russia for three more years.

Snowden is wanted in the U.S. for leaking details about the National Security Agency's snooping operations.

The spokesman for the White House National Security Council, Ned Price, said Snowden needed to return to the United States to face charges related to the leaks.

In his latest interview with Wired, Snowden said the NSA has exaggerated the number of documents that he stole from them - a number far lower than the 1.7million that has been claimed. 

The IT specialist said that he purposely left a digital trail so that investigators could tell exactly what he took and what he only touched - but government auditors didn't find it.

He said: 'I figured they would have a hard time. I didn’t figure they would be completely incapable.' 

He speculated that the documents he stole - the majority of which he has not read - may hold a secret about a senior government figure which would destroy careers. 

He said: 'I think they think there’s a smoking gun in there that would be the death of them all politically.

'The fact that the government’s investigation failed - that they don’t know what was taken and that they keep throwing out these ridiculous huge numbers - implies to me that somewhere in their damage assessment they must have seen something that was like, ''Holy s***.'' And they think it’s still out there.'

He refused to answer whether he believed his leak of confidential documents influenced the reported leaks of more documents from the American intelligence community but spoke of the NSA's lack of control over its own sprawling operation.  

Snowden told Wired magazine that he would be happy to go to prison for his actions but that he wanted it to be for the right reasons 

Snowden said of the agency: 'They still haven’t fixed their problems. They still have negligent auditing, they still have things going for a walk, and they have no idea where they’re coming from and they have no idea where they’re going. 

 'And if that’s the case, how can we as the public trust the NSA with all of our information, with all of our private records, the permanent record of our lives?'

Snowden spoke of his concerns over program MonsterMind which had the ability to not only detect cyberattacks but would respond - without any human involvement in the decision. 

Snowden said that because cyberattacks are often routed through innocent third party countries that leaves the U.S. open to unwittingly making an enemy out of someone who was not involved.

There are other disturbing shock waves from the actions of the NSA, Snowden told Wired. When Syria lost Internet connection in the midst of its civil war in 2012, the outage was caused by the NSA, Snowden claimed. 

He told Wired that while working for Booz Allen in early 2013, he was told by another employee that a division of NSA hackers had tried to infiltrate a major internet provide in Syria the year before, giving them access to much of the country's private communications.

But the U.S. government operation failed - and instead, the hacking attempt blocked a router in Syria, causing the entire country to be thrown offline. 

WIRED's September issue with cover story, The Most Wanted Man in the World, is on newsstands on August 26.    

Commentators on Twitter shared their outrage over the Snowden cover, describing him as a 'traitor' and telling him he should be hugging the Russian flag

The flag used for the Wired September cover is the same one that photographer Platon had used with Pamela Anderson in a 1998 shoot for the late JFK Jr's magazine, George
