Hundreds of mice and dozens of monkeys have been infected with Ebola by the Ministry of Defence as part of research into the killer virus.

Official figures show 200 mice and 56 marmosets were infected with the disease, which causes internal haemorrhaging, and then killed, over two years.

Last night it emerged a patient in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was being tested for Ebola after returning sick from a visit to West Africa, which is currently suffering the worst ever outbreak of the virus.

Porton Down: The site in Wiltshire has been the centre of the UK's chemical weapons research for 100 years

Stocks of Ebola are kept at MoD's research centre at Porton Down, Wiltshire, a highly secretive location where work has long been done on chemical and biological weapons.

Revealing the scale of the Ebola research, officials told The Sun that all the animals were awake when they were infected with the virus, then 'humanely culled' after tests or when their suffering became too severe.

The research was said to be aimed at understanding the development and spread of Ebola in animals, with later experiments working on possible treatments.  

Last night Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency confirmed a patient who returned from West Africa with malaria was being tested for the Ebola virus at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. 

The PHA has advised that there is no increased risk to the wider community.

The Public Health Agency has advised that there is no increased risk to the wider community 

A spokesman for the PHA said: 'The Public Health Agency has confirmed that a person who has recently travelled in an area affected by Ebola is being assessed in accordance with the agreed risk assessment. 

'The PHA is liaising with colleagues and has advised that there is no increased risk to the wider community.

'Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, can be a severe illness in humans. The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is two to 21 days.

'It is important to note that the likelihood of contracting EVD is extremely low unless the person had come into contact with blood or body fluids of a symptomatic person. Therefore we would like to stress that the risk to the public is low.

A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop a fever, a headache, joint and muscle pain, a sore throat, and intense muscle weakness. 

These symptoms start suddenly between two and 21 days after becoming infected.

Diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, stomach pain and impaired kidney and liver function follow. The patient then bleeds internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth.

Ebola virus disease is fatal in 50 to 90 per cent of cases. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chances that they will survive.

'There is no change to the current situation in Northern Ireland in that the risk to the public here is very low.

'The patient being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, has tested positive for Malaria, and an Ebola test is being done as a precautionary measure.

'A further update will be given when results are available.'

Last week, a woman with a history of travel to west Africa was tested for Ebola at St George's Hospital in south London. 

She arrived at the hospital complaining of a fever - and tested negative after being kept in isolation and closely monitored overnight in line with national guidelines for handling the outbreak. 

Other UK hospitals and health centres which have seen walk-in cases of patients tested for Ebola - with negative results - include the City of Coventry Health Centre and Southmead Hospital in Bristol. 

In October, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told Parliament that up to ten Ebola cases could be seen in Britain by Christmas - and that the health crisis will get worse before it improves. 

The death toll from the Ebola epidemic has now risen to 4,950 out of 13,241 cases in the three worst-hit countries of West Africa, the World Health Organization said on Friday.
