A children's etiquette guru has revealed how she became a go-to for celebrity parents, keen for their kids to learn better social skills.

Faye de Muyshondt, who is based in New York City and has just released her first book, socialsklz :-), says people in the public eye turn to her because they are more exposed to the benefits of social and communication savvy.

She told The Times: 'Children
are a reflection of parents and, when you’re a public figure, not only 
are you under a microscope but so are your children.'

Etiquette expert: Faye de Muyshondt is a go-to for A-list parents keen for their kids to learn better social skills

Mrs de Muyshondt, 38, who previously trained celebrities for media appearances, says that she is called upon to teach children everything from table manners to making polite conversation - skills that will last them for life.

She will even guide tweens in their social media use, and how to make a 'digital first impression'.

'I go through social media accounts and online 
activity to guide them in being more safe, private, savvy and aware of 
the fact that the internet is a permanent memory bank,' she explains.

Mrs de Muyshondt believes that many of these life lessons are unintentionally overlooked by overstretched parents due to the general chaos of life, and so children often end up getting berated in public for their lack of social awareness.

'It’s all: "Why didn’t you say 
hello?" and "Why didn’t you look Mrs Smith in the eye?,"' she said. 'That's the sum total of the lesson many children get, and it
doesn’t work well.'

And studies indicate that good social know-how can even give kids a leg-up in school. The Socialsklz website cites the journal Child Development, which published a comprehensive 
analysis of 33 studies on the subject.

Skills for life: Mrs de Muyshondt says that her workshops teach children everything from table manners to making polite conversation

It read: 'Teaching kids social and 
emotional skills leads to an average 11 percentile-point gain in their 
academic performance over six months compared to students who didn't 
receive the same instruction.'

Mrs de Muyshondt's in-demand workshops typically take place over four days and comprise subjects like greetings and introductions, starting 
conversations and phone skills.

Read and learn: Mrs de Muyshondt's new book features exercises for parents and children to practice together

She welcomes children from the age of four and up, and says her goal is to give them skills that help them build self-confidence - and her new book aims to do the same, with exercises for parents and children to practice together.

Typically, she says the most common problems are that children fail to make eye-contact when meeting a new person, they have poor body language, and give one-word responses. Her courses aim to change that.

And parents, it seems, can't speak highly enough of the results.

Tanya Hill, mother of seven-year-old Ivy, wrote: 'Last Sunday, my daughter met someone new. She smiled, gave a firm 
handshake, and confidently looked that person in the eye. I was not 
around, but a friend called me the next day to comment on it.'

And Stephanie Ogozalek, mother of Sebastian, five, could not believe the change in her son.

'Since the class we have witnessed the most amazing behavior shift in
my son,' she said. 'He is listening to us and in turn his behavior has improved. . . A total breakthrough for my boy.'
