A coroner fired from his job after cops caught him joking as he swirled his finger around in a victim's gunshot head wound was previously charged with a car bomb attack on a woman that cost her both her feet, it has been revealed.

Coroner Terry Jarnigan, of Cocke County, Tennessee, was barred earlier this month from disturbing or touching dead bodies and attending crime scenes after he stuck his finger in a victim's gunshot wound, pulled it out with brain matter and exclaimed 'oh brains'.

It casts doubts on a countless number of cases which Mr Jarnigan worked on since being appointed to the position of coroner after having his citizenship rights restored in the late 1990s on serving time for 'wilful injury to another by explosives'.

And now the family of at least one of the deceased that Coroner Jarnigan handled has called for their son's case to be reopened.

Coroner Terry Jarnignan was barred from touching dead bodies or attending crime scenes  after he was caught sticking his fingers in a gunshot head wound of a victim. He resigned from his position 

On November 2, Jarnigan attended an autopsy at Newport Medical Center  to determine whether the 39-year-old shooting victim committed suicide or had been murdered.

The corner stuck two fingers into a bullet exit wound on the victim's head and on realizing he had brain matter on his fingers, put it back into the wound and made a remark 'Oh, brains', according to a police affidavit seen by News 10.

A detective, Paula Wilson, who was taking forensic photos, said Jarnigan was 'twisting his finger around' in the head wound, according to documents.

The District Attorney's office applied for an injunction against Jarnigan and said on November 2 that the coroner had 'inserted his finger into the wounds of a deceased victim thereby completely contaminating any investigation for crime-related DNA, not to mention the effect such activity has on the victim's family'.

Jarnigan resigned this month from his appointed position. Repeated attempts to contact the former coroner for comment have been unsuccessful.

Medical Examiner Dr David McConnell, declined to comment on Mr Jarnigan's resignation. 

Deputy District Attorney Brownlow Marsh told MailOnline on Wednesday that no criminal charges would be brought against Jarnigan.

He added that he was not aware of any medical training that the coroner received, adding that the position did not require it. 

Deputy DA Mr Marsh told MailOnline today that Jarnigan's role as coroner was to order autopsies and that he was not cleared to sign on behalf of the medical examiner. 

Don and Annette Heitman (pictured with their son Alex) have called for the investigation into his death to be reopened after the coroner who oversaw the scene resigned for mishandling of bodies and investigations 

Following the coroner's resignation, details of Jarnigan's violent criminal past have emerged. 

According to court documents seen by MailOnline, and reported by WBIR and WATE, Terry Lee Jarnigan, previously known as Terry Lee Lackey, was charged with 'willful injury to another by explosives' in 1977.

Jarnigan was charged along with his wife Diane, according to court records, for planting explosives in the car of Edna Stamey. Mrs Stamey's husband, John Stamey, was also charged with the attempt on his wife's life and pleaded guilty.

Jarnigan was sentenced to at least 15 years in prison and Diane Jarnigan received ten years. 

According to court records, Mrs Stamey's Chevrolet was blown up with dynamite in Newport, Tennessee on April 14, 1977.

She lost both of her feet, broke her leg and right wrist, and had her hand mutilated in the attack. 

On the evening of April 14, John Stamey reportedly asked his wife to drive her car to a shopping center and park before going with him to a neighboring town. When they returned, he dropped her about 40 feet from her car 'and shot out of the parking lot like a bullet', she told prosecutors.

While she was gone, 'someone had placed dynamite and a blasting cap in the car and had attached wire to the parking lights', records revealed, so that when the lights were turned on, the dynamite would explode. 

Mrs Stamey reportedly had several insurance policies of which her husband was beneficiary - although unknown to him, she had recently changed the beneficiary's name.  

The couple allegedly targeted Mrs Stamey because she was going to turn her husband John in to police for a bank robbery, according to court documents. John Stamey had used Terry Jarnigan's gun during the heist. 

In 1977, Jarnigan, then known as Terry Lackey, was convicted of felonies including 'willful injury by explosives' and arson and detonation of explosives with intent to harm a person.

Cocke County attorney Carter Moore confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that Jarnigan had his citizenship rights restored in the late 1990s. 

A court decided that he had 'the character of a person of honesty, integrity, respectability and veracity'.

He assumed the position of coroner a short time later and held that position up until this month,

In the years leading up to his resignation, a family whose son's death investigation involved Coroner Jarnigan have repeatedly called for Cocke County authorities to reopen the case.

The Medical Examiner's report - signed by Terry Jarnigan - on which Alex Heitman's name is incorrectly written as John Heitman. The signatures of both the ME and the coroner appear to have been written in the same handwriting

Alex Heitman, 29, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head in July 2011 in remote woodlands of Cocke County, 70 miles from his home in Knoxville.

Mr Heitman, a business supervisor at Oak Ridge Schools, had moved to Tennessee in 2008 with his new wife Kristie. She was eight months' pregnant at the time of his death.

His parents, Don and Annette Heitman, from Wisconsin, remain unconvinced of the official verdict of suicide. 

They have repeatedly asked that Alex's death be re-examined by authorities who have given the family little cooperation.

The Heitman family provided an Order For Autopsy following their son’s 2011 death to MailOnline - one of the few pieces of official documentation they have been granted access to. 

The document was signed by Coroner Terry Jarnigan - and the Medical Examiner David McConnell’s signature appears to be written in the same hand.

Their son’s name is incorrectly written as John Heitman.

Deputy DA Mr Marsh told MailOnline today that Jarnigan's role as coroner was to order autopsies and that he was not cleared to sign on behalf of the medical examiner.

He said that the DA's office was aware of no cases involving Mr Marsh which required further investigation. 

The Heitmans' Tennesee representative, Oak Ridge City Councilwoman Trina Baughn told MailOnline that according to 911 audio files and logs, Coroner Jarnigan supervised the scene of Alex Heitman's death for five hours.

However, there exists no evidence that even a basic investigation took place - other than an order for autopsy. 

No fingerprints, ballistics, coroner’s report, police report or credible crime scene photos were ever discovered to have been taken, the family have claimed. 

People who lived near the scene found evidence that had been left behind the following day, Ms Baughn said. 

According the Heitman family, this included portions of Alex’s brain matter and a shotgun shell casing.

In a statement to MailOnline this week, the Heitmans said: 'We are so sorry to learn of another family whose loved one was not treated with the proper respect they deserved. 

'We do not know how Terry Jarnigan treated our son’s body, but it is inexcusable that he allowed partial remains to be left at the scene of his death.

'We would like to know how Mr Jarnigan obtained the authority to sign for the medical examiner without any proper training or appropriate credentials. We cannot say for certain that our son's case was compromised by the coroner's actions. 

'But Cocke County authorities have failed us in every way possible, we deserve an investigation of the matter.'

Their representative, Ms Baughn, added: It’s disturbing to know that someone like that [Jarnigan] was entrusted with such a sacred responsibility. 

'In light of countless errors and omissions in this case, Mr Jarnigan’s recent behaviors and his history with the courts, I expect that local authorities in both Cocke County and Oak Ridge will be compelled to honor the family’s requests. It is the least they can do. It is the moral and compassionate thing to do.'
