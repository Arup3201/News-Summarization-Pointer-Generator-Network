Mourners gathered on Monday to pay their respects to the three Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers who were shot and killed as part of a rampage that shocked a New Brunswick city.

The caskets of slain David Ross, 32, Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Douglas James Larche, 40, will be visible inside Wesleyan Celebration Centre in Moncton from 2pm to 9pm.

Photos of the constables doing police work in Moncton were placed next to their caskets, along with larger photographs of them in uniform.

Gevaudan's photograph showed him in diving gear, Ross' showed him next to his police dog and Larche's captured him riding a bicycle. Next to Larche's casket is a letter of commendation he received for saving a baby.

The caskets were draped in the Canadian flag, and on top of each sits a Canadian Stetson hat and gun holster. Each casket is being guarded by two Mounties.

A memorial service for the slain officers is scheduled to take place at 1pm on Tuesday at the Moncton 
Coliseum following a procession.

George LeBlanc, mayor of Moncton, told the Times Colonist between 5,000 and 7,000 police officers are expected.

'If you just look around here today, it won't take you long to see somebody coming up and shaking the hands of an RCMP officer,' LeBlanc told the paper. 'That is the goodness of Moncton shining through.'

In preparation for the ceremony, Moncton will shut down public transportation on Tuesday. The city has also set up nine other locations for mourners to gather together because of space constraints at the Coliseum.

Mourners earlier gathered on Friday on the steps of RCMP headquarters to pay their respects in a candlelight vigil and left gifts of flowers and stuffed animals.

The officers were killed as part of a shooting rampage last week that shocked the city of approximately 70,000 residents.

Authorities engaged in a 30-hour manhunt that placed the city in a lockdown in order to capture alleged shooter Justin Bourque.

Bourque, 24, is charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. He is expected back in court on July 3.
