Pharrell Williams and Disney's Frozen soundtrack top the charts when it comes to music that helps parents keep children distracted in the car, reveals research by Oxford University's Dr Ruth Herbert.

A leading music psychologist, Dr Herbert has looked into what is the most popular and effective means of occupying kids on long trips, with good old music the overwhelming favourite ahead of iPads and games. 

A majority 80 per cent of parents prefer music as the best distraction for children on road trips, with an iPad second with playing games on 19 per cent.  

Chart-topper: Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy tops a survey of the most popular family car songs

Family favourite: Let It Go from the Disney film Frozen joined Pharrell's blockbuster single 

Just 17 per cent of the 1,000 parents scientifically surveyed for the study in conjunction with Alamo Rent A Car preferred to talk to the children as a way of keeping them entertained.

Despite all the technology available to them,73 per cent of families still love family sing-a-long and the top choices of songs are Let It Go from the animated film Frozen and Pharrell's Happy. 

They have a key common component, says Dr Herbert. The most popular songs with kids, according to their parents, more often than not use what she describes as 'the four chords of pop'.

'The chorus of Let It Go uses the famous "four chords of pop" progression (I V VI IV),' Dr Herbert says in her report. 'This has been used (abused?!) as the basis of hundreds of pop songs. 

Old fashioned: 80 per cent of parents surveyed said music was their number one car distraction for kids 

1 LET IT GO from the film Frozen

2 HAPPY by Pharrell Williams

3 WHEELS ON THE BUS

4 ROAR by Katy Perry

5 THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU BEAUTIFUL          by One Direction

'Whether or not you study music you will, consciously or unconsciously, be familiar with this progression. This means it's easy to join in with.' 

Also popular, perhaps for the same reason, is Katy Perry’s Roar and One Direction’s That’s What Makes You Beautiful, but there is still room for classic nursery rhymes with Wheels on the Bus rounding out the top five favourite car songs for kids list. 

Lyrics and a good beat with high energy are important to more than half of the parents when asked what they think is a good family car song, and Dr Herbert agrees, adding memorable hooks and melodies were also good factors. 

Games and iPads were preferred by by 19 per cent of parents on a road trip

'Let It Go and Happy are littered with small memorable, really rhythmic phrases that coincide with repeated, striking and simple lyrics,' Dr Herbert says. 

'The strongest, most 'ear-worm like', hooks occur at in the chorus - 'Here I stand and here I stay' in Let It Go and 'Cos I'm happy' in Happy.

'Both songs have a feel-good quality. They could both be considered to be 'pop anthems' - celebratory, positive statements.'

Racy acts Rihanna and Lady Gaga's music is popular in the car with families, as is country legend  Dolly Parton

Hip hop is a no-no for 27 per cent of parents but they consider classical music more intrusive than rock or dance music when it comes to styles of music they'd avoid. 

Forget the tabloids and controversies, Lady Gaga and Rihanna are big hits in the car with 63 per cent of parents say they would play them in the car. 

Dolly Parton, who played at Glastonbury this year got a 60 per cent approval rating while 40 per cent would go for the festival's headliner Metallica.
