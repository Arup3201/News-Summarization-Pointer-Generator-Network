Britain has woken to a Barack Obama victory at the U.S. polls and David Cameron was up early to send his own congratulations.

Speaking from Jordan, the Prime Minister called Mr Obama his 'friend' and said they must work together to solve the crisis in Syria and build a trade agreement between the EU and America.

The two world leaders have become close, despite their political differences, and their wives Samantha and Michelle have also become friendly.

He took to Twitter just after Mitt Romney had conceded defeat saying: 'Warm congratulations to my friend @BarackObama. Look forward to continuing to work together'.

Two and a half hours later Ed Miliband also went online, tweeting: 'Congratulations to @BarackObama - great victory based on building fairer economy and optimism about what politics can achieve.'

Obama's victory became assured at 4.24am GMT and Romney gave up officially at just before 6am.

It came as some of the Prime Minister's colleagues appeared to back Republican Mitt Romney. 

In an interview in Jordan Mr Cameron said: 'I would like to congratulate Barack Obama on his re-election.

'I have really enjoyed working with him over the last few years and I look forward to working with him again over the next four years.

'There are so many things that we need to do: we need to kick start the world economy and I want to see an EU-US trade deal.

'Right here in Jordan I am hearing appalling stories about what has happened inside Syria so one of the first things I want to talk to Barack about is how we must do more to try and solve this crisis.

'Above all, congratulations to Barack. I've enjoyed working with him, I think he's a very successful US president and I look forward to working with him in the future.'

Today Mr Cameron travelled by helicopter to a valley dominated by the Al Wahdah dam which is one of the busiest crossing points and was recently hit by Syrian shells.

Some of those arriving seeking shelter in Jordan had walked for up to 15 days to reach the border, he was told by the local Jordanian military chief.

At the camp, he met some of those recently arrived in the country and was treated to a patriotic

Syrian song by young girls at one of the classroom tents set up for the many children living there.

Mr Cameron told them: 'You are not just missed in Syria, all of the world wants to help you, including my country.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, standing in for David Cameron at PMQs, said: ‘I am sure that the House will also want to join me in congratulating President Obama on his election victory last night.’

Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman said: ‘I also join the Deputy Prime Minister in offering our warmest congratulations to the President of the United States, Barack Obama. This morning, he spoke of his determination to create more jobs, health care for all, and to tackle the scourge of inequality. We wish him well.’

Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel has written a letter to Mr Obama Wednesday to congratulate him on his re-election.

'I have deeply appreciated our many meetings and conversations about all
the issues involved in developing the German-American and the 
transatlantic relationship, not least in overcoming the global financial
and economic crisis,' she wrote.

Israel's prime minister Binyamin Netenyahu had a very straight response to the win: 'I will continue working with President Obama to ensure Israel's vital national security interests,' he said.

French President Francois Hollande Wednesday hailed US President Barack Obama's re-election as a 'clear choice for an open, united America that is totally engaged on the international scene.'

Obama's victory would 'once again reinforce our partnership to facilitate the return of economic growth in our countries, to fight unemployment, and to find solutions to crises that threaten us, notably in the Middle East,' he said.

Nelson Mandela congratulated Barack 
Obama on his re-election, in a statement made by Nelson Mandela Centre 
Of Memory CEO Achmat Dangor. He said they would be honoured to receive 
the President at some point in the future.

Mr Dangor added: 'The US is a vital 
partner in Africa’s efforts to overcome poverty and inequality. We are 
confident that under your continued, insightful leadership this 
partnership will grow stronger, both in working with governments on the 
continent but also with the burgeoning civil society movements that seek
to empower communities.

'After your victory in the 2008 
Presidential election Mr Mandela said to you: "You will always be in our
affection as a young man who dared to dream and to pursue that dream. 
We wish you well." It is our hope that your second term in office will 
see the realisation of that dream.'

Obama scored a resounding electoral 
college win - despite predictions of one of the tightest finishes in 
history and the dogged insistence of Romney advisers that they were 
making gains all over the political battlefield.

Despite unemployment standing at 7.9 per cent and Obama performing very poorly during the first presidential debate, Romney was crushed nationally, though he might finish only just behind in the popular vote.

In his 20-minute speech to supporters after winning re-election, President Barack Obama touched on familiar themes he has emphasized throughout his presidency. He urged people to come together and said he would work with leaders in both parties to improve education, spur innovation, reduce debt and lessen global warming.

'We want to pass on a country that's safe and respected and admired around the world. A nation that is defended by the strongest military on earth and the best troops this world has ever known,' he said.

He made references to victims of Superstorm Sandy and the Navy SEALS who killed Osama Bin Laden.

'This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich,' he said. 'We have the most powerful military in history but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities, our culture are the envy of the world but that's not what keep the world coming to our shore.'

'It's the belief that our destiny is shared, that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another.'
