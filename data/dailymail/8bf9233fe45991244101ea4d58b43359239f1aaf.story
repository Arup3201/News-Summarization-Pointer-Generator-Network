David Cameron was today accused of 'sneaking off' from the NATO summit to go sightseeing in Chicago.

US President Barack Obama told reporters last night that Mr Cameron slunk away from the talks to enjoy a relaxing stroll around the city.

Mr Obama seemed proud that the Prime Minister wanted to take a closer look at his home city.

But the intervention may be less than helpful for Mr Cameron, who has been forced to defend himself against claims that he is too fond of 'chillaxing' when he should be getting on with the business of government.

Mr Obama revealed that the Prime Minister was 'sneaking off to do a little sightseeing before he heads home'.

Aides insisted that Mr Cameron had not missed any of the summit and had around two hours to kill before his flight back to London on a commercial airliner.

MailOnline understands Mr Cameron walked around the city centre before visiting the British consulate.

According to a new book released this week, the Prime Minister does not find it difficult to switch off from the pressures of leading the country.

Karaoke with friends, snooker, playing games on his iPad and three or four glasses of wine at Sunday lunch are just a few of the ways Mr Cameron spends his downtime.

In the biography of the Prime Minister and his life at his country retreat Chequers, an ally is quoted  admitting: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for "chillaxing", he would win it.'

Mr Cameron has been forced to insist he is dedicated to the job but he has form for mixing summit business with pleasure.

On a trip to Australia last year, Mr Cameron left the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit early to visit a vineyard.

Mr Cameron has been stung by revelations about his leisure pursuits, and was forced to insist he was ‘completely dedicated’ to the job of Prime Minister.

He even went on to say that he was as 'driven' as Thatcher, famous for her dedication and extremely long working hours.

But sadly for him, his comments came hours after he was seen celebrating the dramatic finale to Chelsea’s Champions League victory over Bayern Munich.

He has been widely lampooned for a picture showing him raising his arms aloft in celebration after Didier Drogba scored the winning penalty.

While other world leaders – especially  Germany’s Angela Merkel – looked on with varying degrees of self-restraint, Mr Cameron threw his arms up in triumph and cheered wildly.

He then gave a glum-faced Mrs Merkel a consolation hug as a bemused President Obama looked away.

The PM was keen to stress that he did not watch Chelsea raise the trophy. ‘I was back to work before any cup was lifted,’ he said.

But his friend and Britain's Chancellor George Osborne, however, was not so busy. He was pictured at the match in Munich smiling broadly as the team celebrated with the trophy in front of him.

The Prime Minister’s leisure habits have been seen by some as a sign of a lack of application.

Some Tory MPs say he should spend more time sorting out the run of problems which have plagued the Government in recent months as opinion polls continue falling.

Mr Cameron has been dubbed 'DVD Dave' with recent photographs taken inside his Downing Street flat showing the couple had 24, Desperate ­Housewives and Band of Brothers in their box set collection.

He was also mocked this week for being pictured enjoying a swanky meal with his wife Samantha on one of their weekly 'date nights.'

The new book reveals that one the first Christmas since he moved into Downing Street, Mr Cameron's friends gave him a karaoke machine which is now at the house and he invites friends over for game of snooker.

There is a machine that fires tennis balls, which he has nicknamed 'the Clegger' after his victorious battle against the Deputy Prime Minister in the 2010 General Elections.

The book, Cameron: Practically a Conservative, serialised in The Times tells how Mr Cameron flicks through the papers early on a Sunday morning and spends his time at his computer.

His afternoon consists of 'a crap film on telly, play with the children, cook, have three or four glasses of wine with lunch, have an afternoon nap, play tennis,' according to a friend quoted in the newspaper.

Michael Gove, the Education Secretary and a family friend, told the authors: 'He is the model of how to have a clear divide between the world of work and then relaxation so you can clear your mind. There are very few people who have such a finely developed capacity to do that.'

What's he up to? Pictured at his home, is Cameron checking up with government work, or playing games aimed at a younger audience?

The book also reveals Mr Cameron can often be found surfing political betting websites.

It also discloses his intense dislike of people clicking pens and checking phones during meetings and how his friend of 20 years and policy guru Steve Hilton believes that Mr Cameron had become too power hungry and has compromised his early ambitions for the demands of the coalition and Whitehall.

Mr Cameron's aides have stated the idea of Mr Cameron spending a disproportionate amount of time relaxing are grossly unfair.

But Mr Cameron was forced into frantic denials over bizarre claims that he spends a ‘crazy and scary’ amount of time playing computer games on his iPad.

The Prime Minister, a fan of Apple’s trendy tablet computer, is said to be obsessed with the cult game Fruit Ninja, in which players swipe their fingers across a screen to slice through moving images of pieces of melon, orange and pineapple.

Mr Cameron is thought to have taken up Fruit Ninja after completing the hit game Angry Birds. In a separate interview earlier this year the Prime Minister admitted that he found Angry Birds ‘addictive’, but denied it was taking up too much of his time.

He said: ‘It is quite addictive, but I want to reassure you I don’t spend a huge amount of time on it.

‘Sometimes on these long flights, when you have done all your  work, you have had all your conversations and prepared all your speeches, you need something to relax with.

‘Sometimes I watch a bit of television, sometimes I play a bit of Angry Birds.’
