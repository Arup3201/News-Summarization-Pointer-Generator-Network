Ronny Deila fears Celtic will eventually be forced to play a game behind closed doors if delinquent fans continue to put them in the UEFA dock.

Europe’s governing body have opened another disciplinary case against the Scottish champions following crowd disorder during the Europa League match against Dinamo Zagreb last week.

Visiting fans set off a firework and reportedly clashed with riot police during the 4-3 loss in Croatia. UEFA have confirmed their disciplinary panel will judge the case on February 19 - the same day Celtic host Inter Milan in the first leg of their Europa League knockout tie.

Celtic manager Ronny Deila has warned the delinquent Celtic fans that their behaviour is harming the club 

It is the fifth time in three years Celtic have faced charges as a result of supporters’ behaviour during European matches.

Deila feels if such behavour isn’t brought to an abrupt halt, the club will be forced to play in an empty stadium.

‘It is very sad if this is the consequence because 99 per cent are very good supporters with a very good reputation - and that one per cent we have to stop,’ Deila said.

‘Because if that (a closed stadium) could be the end product, that is not good for the club or Scottish football. If you continue making the same mistakes you will get consequences.’

Asked if there was much more the club could do, Deila replied: ‘That’s very hard for the club to control. That’s the responsibility of the supporters and the supporters clubs.

‘We need to be finished with it and concentrate on football. It’s about values and how we want other nations and teams and people to look at Celtic. It’s been fantastic for so many years and 99.9 per cent is good now as well. That’s one of the biggest things about Celtic – the supporters – and we have to keep up that reputation.’

Last year the club was fined £42,000 after fans displayed an ‘illicit’ banner at a Champions League clash with AC Milan. Earlier that season, UEFA fined them £4,221 after fireworks were set off during a qualifier with Cliftonville.

During the 2011/12 Europa League campaign, Celtic were fined £21,000 for an offensive banner and setting off of flares at Udinese and £13,000 for ‘illicit chanting’ against Rennes.

Celtic denounced the behaviour of the one fan they said was responsible for the flare - and urged supporters to take more responsibility.

A statement read: ‘Around 1,200 Celtic supporters enjoyed an excellent visit to Zagreb and were welcomed warmly by the city, enjoying a very friendly atmosphere. It is extremely disappointing therefore that the actions of one individual have had such a negative impact.

‘There can be absolutely no excuse for the use of flares or any other pyrotechnics. The threat to the health and safety of supporters caused by their use in football grounds is well known and we have repeatedly asked for this practice to stop.

‘The small handful of individuals who have been involved in behaviour of this kind in Zagreb and on other occasions have done nothing but embarrass the Club and tarnish the excellent and hard-earned reputation of Celtic supporters.

‘We try to do all we can to stop such behaviour, however, we can only do so much - people must take responsibility. Clearly we will deal with any individuals identified in the strongest terms.’

Meanwhile, Deila remains hopeful that John Guidetti, who will train with the first-team squad for the first time today since picking up a minor knee injury against St Mirren, can be a permanent Celtic player before the Inter tie. ‘We’re talking and have an arrangement with the agent, so it’s going the right way,’ he said.
