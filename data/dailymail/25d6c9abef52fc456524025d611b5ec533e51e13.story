A woman became the biggest winner in ‘Price is Right’ daytime history this week when she won a car worth almost $160,000 - and lost her mind celebrating.

Sheree Heil, of Tacoma, Washington, won a $157,300 Audi R8 V8 Spyder Quattro S Tronic while playing the game Gas Money. She also won a pair of Prada shoes and $10,000 cash before she was finished.

Gas Money requires contestants to correctly eliminate four incorrect car prices to leave the car’s correct price as the last one remaining - cash prizes are awarded each time an incorrect price is eliminated.

Happy to be there: Sheree Heil is all smiles even before she knows that she'll be playing for

The anticipation: She knows it's going to be a 'dream car,' as host Drew Carey put it, but she doesn't know which one yet

Contestants have the option of taking the cash and going home at any time, forfeiting their chance to win a car.

Those who get each one right not only win the car, but also $10,000 cash.

Ms Heil excitedly ran on stage after being the closest bidder – without going over – to a pair of Prada shoes. 

The excitable contestant was already overjoyed, telling host Drew Carey how good he smelled after hugging him. Before she had any idea she’d be playing for the German supercar.

Announcer George Gray’s introductio0n of the Audi sent both Ms Heil and the show’s audience into a frenzy.

Shock: Ms Heil says 'cheese and crackers' when she sees the car

'Cheese and crackers,’ Ms Heil said in awe of the car she had a chance to win.

The woman looked about ready to burst when being told the rules of Gas Money before going to work.

First down was $146,770 – she won $4,000 for the correct guess.

She then knocked out two more prices without missing a beat, and growing even more excited by the second.

The crowd, sensing what was about to happen, shouted prices, cheered her on and got louder and louder.

She can't take it anymore: The anticipation is overwhelming her

Ms Heil jumped up and down, the audience jumped up and down and cheered with her.

‘Oh that car, oh that car,’ she said before flashing a thumbs up to the audience when asked if she would go for it.

‘She’s risking $8,000 here… which one of those is not the price of the car?’ Mr Carey implored her.Ms Heil took a deep breath.

‘one five two two nine five,’ she said.

‘She says $152,295 is not the price of the car,’ said Mr Carey. ‘Sheree, good luck.’

‘I’m so nervous,’ ‘Price is Right’ model Rachel Reynolds said before flipping over the last price tag.

‘I’m so nervous too,’ said Mr Carey.

And we're off: The game begins with a correct guess, and Ms Heil winning $4,000

Helping hands: The crowd shouts prices, urging her to continue

Almost there: Only one price left to guess

Cheering her on: The crowd beckons her to make a guess, to win the car

‘Oh please baby,’ Ms Heil said as the crowd roared in anticipation while she clutched Mr Carey by the arm.

Ms Reynolds flipped the price over - $2,000 it said.

‘You got it!’ Mr Carey shouted as the crowd and Ms Heil went berserk.

The biggest winner in the show’s daytime history, she ran around the show’s set jumping, and screaming while the audience shared in the pure joy of the moment.

Ms Heil hugged Ms Reynolds before running back towards the audience and jumping for joy.

‘She just won a $157,000 car,’ Mr Carey said, sounding as if he was in disbelief as she Ms Heil sat in her new Audi R8.

‘That was awesome,’ said Ms Reynolds. ‘I’m so happy for you.’

Ms Heil then got out of her new car and doubled over as if unable to deal with the flood of emotions she felt as the show cut away to commercial.

‘Oh,’ she said, ‘oh my goodness.’

Though impressive, primetime 'Price is Right' specials have offered much larger prizes.

The biggest win ever recorded on a primetime special happened in 2008 when Adam Rose won $20,000 and both showcases - which included a Ford Escape Hybrid, a Cadillac XLR and a $1million bonus for guessing within $1,000 of his showcase's value.

His total winnings were $1,153,908.
