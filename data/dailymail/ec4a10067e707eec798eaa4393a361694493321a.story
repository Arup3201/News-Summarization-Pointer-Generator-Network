Once again, the Championship is proving to be the league with the most exciting promotion battle in Europe and the stakes have never been higher.

With just 10 games left, one point divides a top five of Bournemouth, Derby, Watford, Middlesbrough and Norwich, with Brentford and Ipswich only a result or two behind them. And with £150million awaiting those who reach the Premier League, as well as a share of the new £5billion TV deal coming the following season, the difference between success and failure has never been greater.

It’s going to be a case of who holds their nerve best, starting tomorrow as Middlesbrough take on Ipswich and Norwich face Derby. Sportsmail assesses the leading contenders.

BOURNEMOUTH Points 66 l Goal difference +35

Manager Eddie Howe, 37, has taken his side from the bottom of League Two to the verge of the Premier League in two spells at Dean Court.

Under their attack-minded boss, Bournemouth are the division’s top scorers with 74.

Promotion prospects: Howe is too cool to let his players crack under pressure. The Premier League has seen fairytale stories of Swindon and Blackpool, and Bournemouth could be the latest.

Did you know? Bournemouth’s average home gate this season is 10,147 — lower than any other club bar in the league bar Rotherham.

DERBY COUNTY Points 66 l Goal difference +29

Steve McClaren’s men have bounced back after suffering play-off final heartbreak in May when they were beaten 1-0 by QPR.

Loanees Darren Bent, Jesse Lingard and Thomas Ince have strengthened a strong squad but self-doubt could creep in.

Promotion prospects: The best team on paper, they looked odds-on at one stage. But you feel they are just one slip-up from disaster.

Did you know? McClaren won successive promotions as a Derby County player in the 1980s under Arthur Cox.

Thomas Ince strengthened Derby's squad when coming in on loan but questions remain over them

WATFORD Points 66 l Goal difference +28

Italian owner Gino Pozzo has been through six managers in three years — four this season alone — but this hasn’t disrupted progress at Vicarage Road under latest boss Slavisa Jokanovic.

Strike pair Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo, on loan from Pozzo’s father’s club Udinese, have scored 33 of Watford’s 72 goals.

Promotion prospects: Like to play on the counter-attack, but have crucial games against Middlesbrough and Derby and may have to settle for the play-offs.

Did you know? Watford last graced the Premier League in 2007 and Manchester City’s Darius Vassell scored the goal that sent them down.

MIDDLESBROUGH Points 66 l Goal difference +28

Jose Mourinho’s former assistant at Real Madrid Aitor Karanka has been a huge hit with some help from the Special One, who loaned him 11-goal Patrick Bamford.

Boro have conceded 26 goals from 36 matches — the fewest in the division.

Promotion prospects: In danger of going off the boil, having collected only seven points from 18.

Did you know? Boro have lost their last three Saturday fixtures — against Leeds, Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest.

NORWICH CITY Points 65 l Goal difference +31

The gamble to recruit 33-year-old unknown Alex Neil from Hamilton Academical has paid off, only losing once their last in nine games.

They have plenty of top-flight experience in John Ruddy, Wes Hoolahan and Cameron Jerome.

Promotion prospects: Their squad is battle-hardened and you suspect when the going gets tough, Norwich will be able to get going.

Did you know? Neil became the highest-placed Scottish manager in England following the sacking of Paul Lambert at Aston Villa.

And don’t forget...

Brentford — 62pts: Surprise package who haven’t been distracted by manager Mark Warburton’s departure at the end of the season.

Ipswich — 61pts: Mick McCarthy boasts the division’s leading scorer, 22-goal Daryl Murphy.

Brentford are just a point ahead of Ipswich Town after the two came head-to-head last Saturday
