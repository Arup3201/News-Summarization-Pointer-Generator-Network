Pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine paraded dozens of prisoners of war through the streets today with shouts of 'Fascists! Fascists!' as the conflict plunged new depths.

Around 80 detained Kiev troops were marched through Donetsk followed by road-cleaning trucks spraying water to 'wash the streets of traces of the captives', said a separatist source.

The chilling scene along Artem Street to Lenin Square, a main thoroughfare, was a deliberate rerun of Stalin's display of 57,000 captured Nazi PoW officers and men in Moscow 70 years ago on 17 July 1944 during the Second World War.

Dozens of prisoners of war were paraded through the streets of Donetsk to shouts of 'Fascists! Fascists!'

Around 80 detained Kiev troops were marched through Donetsk in a PoW parade

The 'anti-fascist rally' organised by the self-declared pro-Moscow People's Republic of Donetsk was intended as a spoiler to Ukraine's Independence Day celebrations in Kiev when the pro-Western government put on a show of military might ahead of a new campaign to destroy 'terrorists' in the east of the country.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ordered the firepower and troops to be 'dispatched straight to the area of combat operations' in east Ukraine, where Kiev claims the Russian military is fighting inside his country's borders.

The pro-Moscow insurgents routinely label as 'fascists' the pro-Western forces now in control in Kiev since the toppling of Russian-leaning President Viktor Yanukovych.

Weapons captured from Ukriaine in the six month conflict were also displayed, some daubed with swastikas, including multiple launch rocket systems, howitzers, infantry and airborne combat vehicles.

They were followed by road-cleaning trucks spraying water to 'wash the streets of traces of the captives'

One man emerged from the crowd to slap a 'fascist prisoner' across the face.

Some of the captives had their hands tied behind their backs.

Ahead of the parade, Colonel Sergei Petrovskyi, deputy defence minister of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), said:'We will also take fascist prisoners there and make them walk through the city, just as their inspirers - the Nazis - were paraded in Moscow.'

Today's PoW march through Donetsk has chilling echoes of the July 1944 parade of German captives through Moscow.

The Second World War PoWs from the Russian front numbered around 57,000 officers and men.

They were marched at gun-point through the streets of Moscow on the way to prison camps somewhere in the east after being captured during Operation Bagration, the Red Army's spring blitzkrieg, in 1944.

Not since the time of Napoleon had Moscow witnessed such a parade. 

Just like today's march, the streets were scrubbed after them.  

Some 80 prisoners from pro-Western Ukrainian forces were paraded through the city, with the crowd shouting 'on your knees'.

'A water truck followed them that 'washes off all the dirt they left:,' said journalist Ekaterina Sergatskova, of Ukrainian Pravda, who dubbed the scene one of 'boundless evil'.

In Kiev, Poroshenko revealed a £1.8 billion boost in military spending to tackle the civil war underway with separatists.

'It is clear that in the foreseeable future there will always, unfortunately, be the threat of war,' Poroshenko told 20,000 people during the military parade.

'And we not only have to learn to live with that. We must always be prepared to defend our independence.'

He warned that Vladimir Putin was seeking to further expand his empire - having already swallowed Crimea - in an alarming echo of the build-up to the Second World War.

'War has come to us from over the horizon where it was never expected,' he said.

'In the 21st century, in the centre of Europe, there is a flagrant attempt to breach the border of a sovereign state without declaring war.

'It is as if the world has returned to the 1930s, the eve of World War II.'

Ukraine has lost 722 soldiers in a death toll of 2,300 in the bloodshed.
