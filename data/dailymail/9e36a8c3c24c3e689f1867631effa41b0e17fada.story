'Earn your place': Liv Garfield is set to become the youngest woman ever to lead a FTSE 100 company

From travelling 90 miles to football matches every weekend with her dad, to bringing up two sons, she is used to being in a man’s world.

Which is probably just as well – since Liv Garfield is about to join one of the most exclusive men’s clubs of all. 

The mother-of-two is set to become the youngest woman ever to lead a FTSE 100 company.

The granddaughter of an Everton football club groundsman will make history when she leaves BT early next year to become head of water giant Severn Trent. 

As a female chief executive of a FTSE firm, she will be joining one of the smallest and most exclusive groups in British corporate life.

And at 38, she will also become the youngest woman ever to ascend to the top of a blue chip company. 

The Footsie blue chip index lists the 100 biggest companies in the London Stock Exchange, and includes corporate giants such as Vodafone, Shell and Tesco. 

Currently only three companies in the index – airline easyJet, cigarette firm Imperial Tobacco and fashion label Burberry – have female chief executives, making Mrs Garfield’s arrival all the more remarkable.

But there is one ambition she still has the occasional daydream about. 

She told the Mail: ‘I said for my entire childhood that I wanted to be the Everton manager, so that was my absolute ambition. 

‘My mum had my bedroom with pink and fluffy clouds and I spent my childhood pinning up Everton pin-ups over them.’

From the age of five, she would travel every weekend with her dad to the Everton match – even though her family lived 90 miles away in Harrogate.

‘My grandparents are all Scousers. My dad and I used to go with my granddad,’ she said. ‘That was normal for me.’

Successful: Liv Garfield with Prime Minister David Cameron in March earlier this year

Now the Cambridge graduate takes her 
two young sons to the game most weekends – and is trying to dissuade her
 youngest, aged two, from switching his support to Chelsea.

Her husband Morgan runs a property investment fund.

She said her biggest mistake in the past was buying a sports car, only to discover that she was pregnant.

‘I couldn’t get into it,’ she said. But that was the only time family life has held her back – and she said she never encountered the ‘glass ceiling’ that prevents many women rising to the top.

Despite being a hugely successful businesswoman, Mrs Garfield's regret is not becoming the Everton manager

‘I didn’t find getting back on the ladder [after motherhood] hard,’ she said. ‘For any female to do well in business you have to ignore the fact that you are female.

'You have got to earn your place based on your own qualities and abilities.’

And her approach certainly seems to work.

In September, she was ranked as number ten in Fortune Magazine’s hottest rising business stars, putting her alongside success stories such as Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, and making her the highest ranked Briton.

In addition to the three existing FTSE 100 companies led by women, Royal Mail, which floated last month and is led by Canadian Moya Greene, is expected to enter the FTSE 100 next month.

Unless any of the companies drop out of the index, Mrs Garfield will be the fifth female chief executive when she takes up her new role.

She was educated at the independent Birklands Belmont School – now the £8,733-a-year Belmont Grosvenor – in Birstwith, near Harrogate, and then at Bootham School in York, which charges up to £15,990 annually for day pupils and £26,115 for borders.

During school holidays she would help her parents run their project management business. After studying French and German at Cambridge, she worked at management consultancy Accenture for six years. 

She joined BT in 2000 and will now move to Severn Trent, which supplies water to about four million households across the Midlands and Wales.

The job, which could pay up to £2.4million a year, will see her lead the largest water company listed on the London Stock Exchange.

She said it was a ‘huge wrench’ to leave BT, but added: ‘I have every confidence it will continue to thrive. I am really looking forward to joining Severn Trent.’
