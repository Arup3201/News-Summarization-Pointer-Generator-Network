Building a chapel 800metres below the Earth's surface is hardly conventional.

Yet, these striking images show how one salt mine in Colombia has been turned into a place of sanctuary.

Now a major tourist attraction, the mine in Nemocon, Cundinamarca, around 58 miles from the country's capital 
Bogota, dates back over 500 years.

It was built by miners who carved a place for their daily prayers before they started work.

The mine was originally used by the ancient Muisca indigenous people benefited
from the enormous salt deposit and consequently became one of the most
prosperous pre-Hispanic societies of their time.

Years later, the salt was used to 
finance the campaigns of the liberators Nariño and Bolívar who brought 
independence to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela 200 years ago.

The Spanish declared the site the ‘City of Whites’ by vice regal decree.

The salt deposit was formed 250million years ago when an inland sea covered the region.

The sea eventually dried out and left an enormous deposit of salt buried 
below the earth and mud. It solidified and became rocks of salt.

The cavernous surroundings of the mine 
in Nemocon are illuminated by the reflection of the light on the pond 
water.

There is a large chamber with mirrors
of salt water, an events room, a wishing pool and a waterfall of salt 
which is more than 80 years old.

In the chapel chamber lies an enormous sphere made of rock which weights 1,300 kilos and represents the world.

Another
incredible feature of the mine, which has enchanting stalactites and 
stalagmites, is the salt crystal weighing 1,600 kilos, which was carved 
into the shape of a heart in the 1960s by miner Miguel Sánchez.

The mine, which is the largest deposit 
of rock salt in the world, is buried deep in the hill of Zipa - the name
of an important indigenous chief - at 2,652m above sea level with an 
average temperature of 14˚C.

Near to the salt mine is the Zipaquirá Cathedral, which was inaugurated in 1995.

It is situated 180m underground and required a staggering 250,000 tons of rock salt to be extracted.
