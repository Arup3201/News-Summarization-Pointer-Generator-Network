Today's Natalie Morales has told how training for a marathon after turning 40 and having two children is no easy feat, despite her apparent athleticism.

The New Jersey-based news anchor, 41 - who completed five marathons during her twenties and early thirties - exclaimed: 'Things are definitely more painful. I'm old. It hurts!'

She is set to run the 42.195km Boston Marathon on April 21 in a bid to raise money for last year's bombing victims and is hoping to beat her 'personal best' of 3:31:02.

To date, Ms Morales has scored $13,593 in donations and is appealing for more people to come forward.

As part of her training she has been trying to run 50 miles a week, slotting in sprints around her hectic work and home life schedule.

A hamstring injury has slowed progress but she is hoping to make a full recovery in time for race day.

'[It's] literally a pain in my butt!' she said, adding determinedly: 'It's always something. You're always fighting through the pain.'

While she hasn't run a full marathon in eight years, Ms Morales completed half-races annually instead.

'Growing up, I watched my dad do half marathons and used to think, "Wow, how does he run so far?"'

She previously told Runner's World magazine that is was her father who inspired her to take up running.

'Growing up, I watched him do half marathons and he was always running six or seven miles.

'I used to think, "Wow, how does he run so far?" I grew up seeing my dad as an example.'

She ran her first marathon in 1995 after moving to New York and completed the same race the following year.

In 2000 and 2001 she ran the Hartford 
Marathon in Connecticut and then returned to New York in 2006, where she
 achieved her personal best.

Happy family: Ms Morales has two children named Luke, aged five, and Josh, ten, with her husband of 15 years,  Joseph Rhodes - they will be cheering her on as she runs the Boston Marathon this month

Her husband of 15 years, Joseph Rhodes, has also competed in many races with her and running is a passion they share.

Ms Morales says the Boston Marathon has always been on her 'bucket list' and the bombing last year motivated her to take part.

Along with raising money for victims of the terrorist attack she is also supporting athletes with disabilities.

'[It's] for such a great cause, to be able to do something so positive,' she said.

On another front, she feels like she's setting an important example for her sons Luke, aged five, and Josh, ten, about working hard and pursuing life goals.

'What better message to send to my kids that mom is going to run this incredible marathon?' the TV presenter concluded.
