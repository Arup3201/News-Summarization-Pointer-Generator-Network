A dog was rescued from Snowdonia yesterday, 10 days after his owner was badly injured in a 450ft fall.

Black spaniel Sutty had built himself a nest on a tiny ledge about 2,000ft high and survived for 10 days without food or water.

It is believed he had been scared away by the sound of a RAF helicopter that rescued his 60-year-old owner after the fall in Ogwen Valley on May 29.

Sutty (pictured in the rucksack) was rescued from Snowdonia after 10 days when climbers Rob Shepherd and Sian Williams heard his whimpering

Sutty was credited with saving the man's life by attracting attention to his owner as lay unconscious after the fall near the Atlantic Slabs.

The walkers who found the man from Wolverhampton said they heard the dog barking.

Sutty, a 14-year-old cross breed, was discovered by Rob Shepherd, a member of the Llanberis  mountain rescue, and his girlfriend Sian Williams as they went for an evening climb on Saturday.

They said they heard the sound of faint whimpering and Mr Shepherd made a difficult ascent to find the little dog sheltering on the ledge.

A member of the Ogwen Valley mountain rescue team and Miss Williams helped lower Sutty into her rucksack.

Posters had been placed around the trails to help find Sutty but no one had seen him until Saturday.

Sutty's family were called and they immediately drove up from Wolverhampton for the 'emotional' reunion.

Sutty had not been seen since he helped raise the alarm when his owner fell 450ft on the mountain

The man is still in hospital recovering from his fall but his daughter came to collect the dog today.

Chris Lloyd of the Ogwen team, who 
went to the scene, said today: 'As soon as the dog was found we 
telephoned the owner’s daughter.

'She was delighted and came over immediately with her husband from Wolverhampton.'

He said Sutty was in excellent condition considering his ordeal and had built himself a nest either for warmth or to shelter from the heat.  

Mr Lloyd said: 'Sutty is in remarkable condition. As
well as having to survive with nothing to eat or drink the dog would 
also have to contend with the heat. 

'Posters had been put up in the area so when a local couple heard whimpering as they climbed on Atlantic Slabs they knew it had to be the missing dog.

'It’s fantastic - a real good news story from the mountains.'
