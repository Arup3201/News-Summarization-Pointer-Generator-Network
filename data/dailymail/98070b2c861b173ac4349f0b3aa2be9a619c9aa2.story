This is the older brother of the missing British twins who ran away from their Manchester council house to Syria to become 'jihadi brides'. 

Ahmed Halane, 21, is believed to have gone to the war-torn country last year to fight with terror group ISIS, and is now banned from returning to the UK. 

Two weeks ago his twin sisters Salma and Zhara, both 16, who have 28 GCSEs between them, sneaked out of their bedrooms during the night two weeks ago and boarded a flight to Turkey.

They are then thought to have travelled overland to Syria and called their parents to say: 'We’re not coming back'.

New videos have revealed their brother Ahmed had achieved some  fame for his ability to memorise and sing the Koran, which started at the age of five.

Some of the films, viewed by tens of thousands on YouTube, show him competing in contests across Britain and even in Dubai, where he has won prizes of around £500.

In one film he describes how he had started memorising texts from the religious book from the age of five.

In the video, Ahmed, who was born in Denmark but moved to England when he was aged nine, says: 'When I came here to the UK that's when things got a bit more intensive.

'My father opened a school in Bolton, it was quite intensive. Six days a week we used to go. Sometimes four hours a day.

'Friday used to be our day off.'

He adds how he progressed from learning one page of the Koran a day 'to five or six pages', describing it as 'a journey'.

And by the age of 13 he had memorised the whole book.

Later he admits he got married at 18 which 'helped him very much' to 'get better' at it. MailOnline understands that he also has a child.  

But shortly after the video was filmed last summer he fled to Syria to fight with ISIS.

Police probe: Officers were seen leaving the house. The large back and front gardens were strewn with discarded household items and children's plastic toys

Police have said the twins 'potentially pose a threat to themselves and the community'. 

Dr Abdelaziz Belattar, 53, who helped organise the competition for the Muslim Association of Britain, said their brother led prayers at the Al Furqan Mosque in Moss Side, where the twins’ father was said to teach the Koran.

Dr Belattar, from Hulme, Manchester, said: ‘Ahmed had a good voice and used to lead prayers at a local mosque during Ramadan. I told him that he had the attributes of a good Islamic teacher, particularly as he could recite the Koran.’ Dr Belattar said Halane had told him he had been studying Islam in Denmark, and planned to complete his studies at a university in Egypt.

But he said the student had disappeared since the video was filmed last summer. ‘I assumed he Ahmed had gone to Eygpt as I have not seen him since at the mosque or around Manchester’, he said.

‘He was not extremist at all in his manner. I can’t believe his family could be caught up in anything like this.’ In the video, Ahmed says his father and other family members can all recite the Koran. He said he started memorising it a page at a time when he was 5 and he could recite the whole book by age of 13 – learning at group sessions after school or mosque six days a week.

He said he started teaching other children at the age of 16 and recites the Muslim holy book every 10 days to help it stay in his mind. 

Dr Bellatar did not know the rest of Ahmed’s family.

It is not clear whether he is the brother said to have inspired the twins to become jihadist fighters.
