OJ Simpson’s manager has released a documentary ‘in his own words’ where the disgraced NFL star addresses the murder trial and says his biggest regret in life is cheating on his wives.

It has been 20 years since Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were found brutally murdered outside an L.A. home and her ex-husband was put on trial – and later acquitted - for the crime.

The documentary was filmed before Simpson’s 2008 kidnapping and armed robbery conviction and sees him rant about the accusations of domestic violence made by his late ex-wife, the aftermath of the murders and the subsequent 1994 trial.

In his words: A documentary featuring interview footage of OJ Simpson where he speaks about the alleged domestic abuse of his ex-wife Nicole, the murders of her and her friend Ron Goldman and the subsequent trial in 1994 has been released

The documentary, called, O.J. In His Own Words, Simpson says the biggest regret in his life was cheating on his partners.

‘I was unfaithful to both of my wives, and it’s what I’ve regretted most in my life,’ he says at one point during the 53-minute film.

OJ Simpson and Nicole Brown married in 1985 and had two children Sydney and Justin.

In 1989, the former football player pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson. The couple divorced in 1992.

The documentary also addresses the two 911 calls made by Simpson's late ex-wife in October 1993, in which she told an operator that he was going to 'beat the s*** out of me'.

In the newly released film, Simpson says the couple were having an argument about her friend, who he claims were prostitutes.

'I
 don’t want these drug people and these hookers hanging around my kids, 
and I became the bad guy yelling on the tape,’ he says in the 
documentary first published on RadarOnline.

‘America
 made me the dog of all dogs, the poster boy for abuse, because I’m 
pissed off that drug people and hookers are hanging around the house my 
kids are at.

‘What other American man who found that out that day wouldn’t have been as upset as I was?’

Nicole Brown Simpson was found brutally murdered alongside her friend at her Los Angeles home on June 12, 1994.

On
 June 17, the day that Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to 
police on murder charges, the former football player led officers on an 
infamous low-speed pursuit in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California.

Simpson
 finally surrendered to police and the internationally publicized trial 
lasted one year and was dubbed the 'trial of the century'.

In 1995, the disgraced NFL star was acquitted of the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and Mr Goldman.

‘When my trial was over, I was angry,’ Simpson says in the documentary.

‘I
 was trying to get even with a lot of people that said a lot of untrue 
things. The media, I always say, convicted me, not the jury.’

The
 documentary was filmed by Simpson’s manager Norman Pardo before his 
incarceration and has been released for the 20th anniversary of Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman’s murders.

‘I’m putting it out so people can see who OJ really is,’ Mr Pardo told RadarOnline.

In
 2008, Simpson was found guilty of kidnapping, armed robbery and other 
charges in what he said was an attempt to retrieve memorabilia and 
personal items from two sports collectibles dealers in a casino hotel 
room.

Simpson was sentenced 
to between nine to 33 years in Nevada state prison but was granted 
parole on some convictions last July. However he must serve at least 
four more years.
