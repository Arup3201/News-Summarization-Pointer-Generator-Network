An educational centre at Cambridge University nearly lost two 'irreplaceable' artefacts after they were taken by an oblivious tourist who thought they were souvenirs.

The Japanese artefacts – a wooden plaque and replica school textbook – went missing from the Kaetsu Educational and Cultural Centre last Saturday as it hosted a Japan Day celebration.

The replicas were loaned to the university from a museum in Japan, marking the first time they had ever been taken out of the country.

Staff launched a search after they noticed the precious objects were missing.

They eventually found the tourist who had mistaken the artefacts for souvenirs and returned them with an apology.

University officials said the textbook is a replica of those used in Japanese schools during World War II.

During the war residents of the island of Okinawa – a key battleground for Japanese and American forces – were forced to speak the Japanese language the rest of the country used, rather than their own dialect, for the purposes of unification.

As punishment, those who spoke their native tongue were forced to wear the wooden plaque around their neck.

The artefacts are now being returned to the Peace Memorial Museum in Okinawa.

Peter Roberts-Taira, the education centre's director, said he was relieved when he found out that the artefacts had been recovered.

He said: ‘It's the first time these items have ever been out of Japan, so the museums themselves were taking a risk.

‘It was Saturday, right at the very end of the day when everyone was packing away that we realised they had gone.

‘One was a wooden plaque with some Japanese on it, the other was a maths book which children had in their classrooms.’

He added: ‘You wouldn't know they were valuable to look at, so maybe somebody just though they could take them.

‘The message went out wider to people who asked their friends, and apparently they discovered a friend of a friend had thought those things were possible to take away as souvenirs.

‘They are irreplaceable, if they are gone, they are gone forever. It's very, very special to have them at all.'
