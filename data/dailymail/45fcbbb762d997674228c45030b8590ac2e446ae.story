Borussia Dortmund remain in the Bundesliga relegation play-off spot after twice letting a one-goal lead slip in their 2-2 draw with second-placed Wolfsburg.

Jurgen Klopp's men have suffered a dramatic fall from grace this season but would have been hoping to give their fans something to cheer in their final home match of the year.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave them an ideal start with his eighth-minute opener but Kevin De Bruyne levelled matters just before the half hour.

Ciro Immobile once again put Dortmund ahead in the 76th minute but Ronaldo Naldo ensured Dortmund remain third bottom with his strike five minutes from time.

The result is a setback for Wolfsburg too as they are now 11 points behind pacesetters Bayern Munich, while they are only four ahead of Borussia Monchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen, both of whom won on Wednesday night.

Gladbach moved up to third on goal difference after a 4-1 victory over 10-man Werder Bremen.

Max Kruse scored the opener from the penalty spot just after the half hour and although Oscar Wendt doubled their lead after 38 minutes, Zlatko Junuzovic pulled one back just after half-time.

Christoph Kramer re-established the home side's two-goal lead shortly before Luca Caldirola's 66th-minute red card, while Branimir Hrgota sealed an emphatic win two minutes from time.

Stefan Kiessling's 79th-minute effort was the difference as Bayer Leverkusen beat Hoffenheim 1-0 - although they slipped to fourth after Gladbach's crushing win.

In what proved to be the clash of the night, Hertha Berlin blew a 3-0 and 4-2 lead as they were forced to settle for a 4-4 draw at plucky Eintracht Frankfurt.

Goals inside the first 37 minutes from John Brooks, Anis Ben Hatira and Julian Schieber appeared to put Hertha on course for all three points but Stefan Aigner pulled one back just before half-time.

Haris Seferovic narrowed the deficit to one goal and although Peter Niemeyer put Hertha ahead with 10 minutes remaining, Alexander Meier struck twice in added-on time to rescue a thrilling point for Eintracht.

Goals either side of half-time from Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Roman Neustadter helped Schalke hit back to win 2-1 at Paderborn, who had taken the lead through Kaan Ayhan's own goal.
