Twitter could be worth more than £7billion ($11bn) if it goes public in 2014, a financial research firm claimed today.

New York specialist financial researchers Greencrest claims the social networking firm is already preparing to take the company public next year, according to a new report.

The firm made its valuation after analysing trading in secondary markets, where shares are privately traded.

The service was originally launched in October 2006, by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Evan Williams and Biz Stone

It has over over 500 million registered users as of 2012, generating over 340 million tweets daily and handling over 1.6 billion search queries per day.

Over 200m active users send tweets each month.

Max Wolff, an analyst with Greencrest, told Forbes that Twitter's value is up since Facebook went public last year.

'Using the secondary market for shares to mark enterprise value is a very difficult and opaque process.

'It is a rumor rich and special share class soup,' he told the publication. 

However, it is believed that Facebook and games maker Zynga's recent poor IPOs (Initial Public Offering) may have affected the valuation.

Facebook's shares are down 26% since its IPO, while Zynga's value has dropped by 75%.

A funding round in 2011 valued Twitter at $8bn, after which the value rose to $10bn on secondary markets before Facebook's IPO pushed the value back down to $9bn.

Greencrest analyst Max Wolff said Twitter's value has also been swollen by speculation that Apple is interested in acquiring the company.

Twitter is preparing to take the company public in 2014, and could already be worth as much as $11bn, according to a report by specialist financial researchers Greencrest.

'That said, Twitter is up since the Facebook IPO and is now valued at northward of $11bn.

'This makes sense as growth in users and new monetisation efforts are both yielding fruit and pointing toward a good 2013 for Twitter.'

Backing up comments made late last year by chairman Jack Dorsey, currently on holiday with model Lily Cole, that 'You can think of an IPO as an exit or a goal, or you can think of it as more of a milestone.

'For us, it's a milestone,' he said.

Dorsey also said the firm would IPO 'when we feel the company is ready for that milestone.'

Greencrest also uses recent managerial shifts to back up their claim, pointing to Ali Rowghani’s move from CFO to COO, and the addition of ex-Zynga guy Mike Gupta as CFO. Also, Newsvine’s Mike Davidson is now on board as VP of design.
