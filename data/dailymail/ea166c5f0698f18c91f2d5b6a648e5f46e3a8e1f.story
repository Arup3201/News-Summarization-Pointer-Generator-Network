Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall made a surprise visit to a street party in the heart of London today to kick start the official Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

The couple popped along to Piccadilly, just a short hop from their home at Clarence House, and sat down with 500 revellers at a table decked with red, white and blue.

Camilla had been particularly keen to attend an event as she is patron of The Big Jubilee Lunch, an initiative organised by the Eden Project to encourage members of the public to share a meal with their neighbours on such a special day.

The couple arrived at 12pm and, after
 meeting and greeting organisers, plunged into the several thousand 
strong crowd that had gathered, shaking hands and greeting well-wishers.

'What a wonderful day, let's hope the weather holds off,' Charles told one.

'So glad you could be here.'

The prince then directed his wife to 
two chairs that had been set aside for them at the giant picnic table, 
adorned with patriotic cushions.

'Darling this is you,' he said as he 
ushered Camilla, dressed in an Anna Valentine dress and 
weather-appropriate Burberry raincoat with a pearl and diamond choker 
around her neck, to her seat.
Camilla chatted easily with fellow guests about the food they had 
brought with them. 'Ah sausage rolls, you can't beat a sausage roll can 
you?' she said.

She also helped herself to a bowl of cherries that had been placed on the table.
Charles meanwhile talked about the weather – 'It's been frightful, hasn't it?' he asked. 'Let's just hope it clears up for us.'

Camilla also produced a large white box containing an enormous and very beautifully decorated Union Jack sponge cake.

'Here you I've been up all night making this,' she said with a wink.

'Ok, well I haven't. Well it was my 
idea, though, and it is the thought that counts. I am not sure you would
 want to eat anything I made anyway!'

The Piccadilly Big Jubilee Lunch 
street party saw the world-famous street closed for the first time in 
its history and decked out in yards of bunting.

Local landmarks and 
businesses, such as The Ritz hotel, Fortnum and Mason and The Wolseley 
all took part.

According to the organisers of the Big Lunch, street parties are being held across the Commonwealth and as far afield as Tuvalu, China and the Arctic.

During the day more than 3,000 people
 will sit down at a trestle table for a Jubilee-themed lunch to raise 
funds for the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.

Before they left the couple stood and
 sang the National Anthem before racing off back to Clarence House to 
change and head of for the river pageant.

'We have to get going so we can catch the boat – can't be late!' Camilla said.
