A video has captured the moment a bride who thought she was wearing a wedding gown for a photoshoot discovered that she was actually dressed up for her big day.

The bride-to-be, Christina, thought she was only at the Mall of Georgia in Buford with a photographer friend to pose for a bridal project but wept as she learned that her loved ones were there as well - and waiting for her to walk down the aisle.

The start of the video shows Christina wearing a wedding dress and with her hair and makeup finished perfectly as she is led through the mall and outside to a large Christmas tree.

Stunned: Bride-to-be Christina was shocked when her father, Michael, told her that rather than taking part in a bridal shoot, she was actually at the Mall of Georgia to be married to her fiance, Brian

Shock: Her father broke the news to her as she waited to have her pictures taken by a photographer

As she prepares to pose for photographs, she is led around the tree - and is stunned to see her father Michael waiting for her, dressed in a tuxedo and with a bunch of flowers.

He tells her: 'You're getting married today.'

Overwhelmed, she hugs him and wipes away tears, before he whisks her back around the tree to see her crowd of waiting guests and her fiance, Brian - the man behind the plan.

Her father walked her to the end of the aisle, which was marked by the standing crowd, and led her towards the man she was about to marry as her bridesmaids cheered.

With Christina still wiping away her tears, the couple were married and celebrated with their friends.

The video, which was shared to YouTube on Tuesday, also contains footage taken by a drone above the crowd.

It shows the crowd rushing into place in the square before she is pulled back around the tree.

'Meet Brian and Christina and their Surprise Flash Mob Christmas Wedding,' the video's creator, Chris Green, wrote on YouTube.

'Christina, who is engaged, got in her wedding dress because she thought she was at the mall to do a favor for a photographer friend working on a special bridal project.'
