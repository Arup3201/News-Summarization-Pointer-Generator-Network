Thousands of music fans have started their pilgrimage to Reading and Leeds for two of the biggest highlights in the festival calendar.

The overwhelming majority of each site's 100,000 revellers are in their late teens, with many celebrating GCSE results day today.

And it seems their celebrations won't be dampened as both festivals look set to dodge the rain. 

Despite downpours this week, Leeds looks set to remain dry until next week, and Reading will also bask in the sunshine, forecasters say.

Pilgrimage: Reading's annual rock festival - the world's oldest - has become a ritual for teenagers in the wake of A Level and GCSE results, which came out this week

Kitted out: 200 miles north east of Reading's Richfield Avenue, these girls plodded to Bramham, near Wetherby, for the twin festival in Leeds

Reading's annual rock festival - the world's oldest - opened its gates at 8am today, with revellers pouring in on buses, coaches and trains lugging camping gear - and wheelbarrows of beer.

It was an identical scene 200 miles north east, with festival-goers loading their bags into trolleys from supermarkets as they powered towards the country estate in Bramham, near Wetherby.

The two festivals are twinned and share the same set.

American pop punk stars Blink-182 will open for Leeds on Friday, before heading down to Reading's Richfield Avenue to bring the festival to a close on Sunday night.

Other headliners include Paramore, Queens of the Stone Age, and Arctic Monkeys.

Bryony Harrison, aged 17, from Hull, East Yorkshire, travelled down to Reading and soaked up the atmosphere with friends who all wore fluorescent face paint.

Rammed: It doesn't start until tomorrow, but Richfield Avenue is already a sea of colourful tents filled with festival-goers to see Blink 182 and the Arctic Monkeys

Twin line-ups: Acts will start at either Reading or Leeds before driving to the other site to play to another 100,000 revellers in the annual festival calendar highlight

'This is my first time here and it's great,' she said.

'I can't wait to see Arctic Monkeys and Disclosure.'

School friends Chloe Morris, Hannah Bailey, Hannah Campbell, Talulah Farrier, and Rebecca Sneddon, all 16 years old, got straight on the train after picking up their GCSE results at school in Bromley, Kent, for three-day weekend in Reading.

'We are all celebrating,' said Chloe, adding: 'This is our first time here and we have absolutely no idea what to expect. I'm here for Arctic Monkeys and a few other bands.'

The beer was flowing early. George Farrell and pals were struggling along carrying 186 cans of lager and cider.

'This will probably do us for tonight,' joked the 17-year-old college student from near Brighton, East Sussex, who said he had bought the beer from a street seller nearby.

There were spots of rain in the air as the crowds arrived but the forecast is for cool, cloudy conditions for most of the weekend. Rain is forecast for Monday when the site closes.

Sisters Katrina and Gabriella Holmes from Littlehampton, West Sussex, struggled into the entrance with their heavy bags.

'It's my first time here and I'm really excited. I'm looking forward to seeing The 1975,' said Gabriella, aged 16.

The day has arrived: Festival-goers look excited as they finally arrive at Reading, two months after tickets for both festivals sold out online

Reading Festival began life as The National Jazz Festival in Plumpton, East Sussex, in 1961, with weekend tickets costing just £2 pounds.

It changed its name to The National Blues & Jazz Festival in 1962, moved to Reading in 1972 and is known today for showcasing a large variety of rock and alternative bands.

In 1999, it had become so successful, owners Festival Republic decided to launch a second prong in Leeds. 

A weekend camping ticket now costs £205, and all had been snapped up two months ago.

A few thousand festival goers had already arrived Wednesday evening after purchasing 'early bird' tickets to get the best camping spots.

However, the majority arrived today ahead of acts taking to the stages from 11.30am Friday.
