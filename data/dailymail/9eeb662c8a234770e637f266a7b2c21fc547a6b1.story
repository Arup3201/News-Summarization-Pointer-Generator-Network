Fantastic fungi: This enormous mushroom measures three ft (107cm) wide and weighs a staggering 16.4lbs (7.45kg). The oval fungus, popularly known as the 'immortality mushroom,' is believed to possess many health giving benefits. There is no fixed price for the mushrooms, with price depending on quality and size, but based on the price for a 'basic' bag, the giant mushroom is worth around US$894 (£592)

Store owner Wei Fangning showed off the giant mushroom - also known as ganoderma lucidum - at his shop in Hezhou city, in China's south-west Guangxi province.

The Lingzhi has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years.

It is very distinctive looking as it is flat, with a conspicuous red-varnished, kidney-shaped cap and, depending on a caps's age, is white with brown pores underneath.

It has no gills on its underside and releases its spores through fine pores. When fresh, it is described as 'soft and corky'.

There is no fixed price for the mushrooms, with price depending on quality, the amount of processing and size, among other criteria.

Based on a 'basic' bag of Lingzhi powder priced at $30 (£20) for 0.56lbs (250 grams), however, the giant mushroom is worth around US$894 (£592). 

The Lingzhi mushroom is sought after in medicine because it is associated with long life.

There are said to be around a 1,000 compounds found in the mushroom. It is said to boost immunity thanks to active compounds called polysaccharides, which can increase the activity of white blood cells, according to one herbalist. 

Experts at the Chinese Academy of Sciences also claimed that the polysaccharides and triterpenes – hydrocarbons - in the lingzhi are the key ingredients to maintaining a physiological balance within the human body.

It is used to help lower blood pressure and relieve symptoms of allergies as well as coughs and asthmas. Some herbalists think it can even slow down the ageing process.

Scientists have suggested that beta-glucans, which are complex sugars found in Lingzhi, may also stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.

The Lingzhi has been recognised for its medicinal properties for over 2,000 years and some modern scientists have documented its powerful effects.

The mushroom was documented in ancient scripts and its first known depictions in art, in 1,400 AD, are associated with Taoism.

The images extended beyond religion to appear in paintings, furniture and even women's accessories.

The first book wholly devoted to medicinal herbs was Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing written in 25 to 220 AD. In it, it describes some health benefits of the Lingzhi.

In updated volumes, the mushroom was attributed with therapeutic properties, such as enhancing vital energy, strengthening cardiac function, increasing memory, and even anti-ageing effects.

Wild Lingzhi is rare and before it was cultivated, only the nobility could afford it. It was believed that the sacred fungus grew in the home of the immortals on the 'three aisles of the blest' off the coast of China.
