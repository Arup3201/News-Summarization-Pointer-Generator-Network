'Gunman': Hans A. Petersen, 49, a biotech executive from California, has been charged in the double shooting of his wife's brother and his former business partner

A biotechnology executive from California has been arrested after police say he shot his estranged wife's brother and a former business associate in an early morning rampage.

Hans A. Petersen, 49, of La Jolla, was apprehended Wednesday after he was subdued with a blow to the head during a scuffle with one of the victims.

The two victims, a cancer researcher and a fourth-generation real estate investor, were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla to be treated for gunshot wounds. Both men are expected to recover.

Mr Petersen, the CEO of the genome data analysis company Bays Four Corp, was treated for head injuries and charged with attempted homicide, shooting into an occupied building and burglary. He was ordered held without bail.

The incident started at around 3am when investigators say Peterson opened fire on a home in the 5700 block of Waverly Drive, wounding 53-year-old Steve Dowdy.

Dowdy, a highly regarded biologist and professor at University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, was struck in his lower back after he was awakened by gunfire coming from his backyard.

Just before 7am, more gunshots rang out about half a mile from the site of the first shooting. Police officers who responded to the scene in the 1400 block of Cottontail Lane discovered 43-year-old Ron Fletcher with a gunshot wound to the abdomen.

Next to Fletcher police found his alleged assailant and estranged brother-in-law, Hans Petersen, nursing a head wound.

Second attack: The 49-year-old suspect allegedly broke into Fletcher's home half a mile away from the first crime scene and shot him in the abdomen

Fletcher told police that his relative had broken into his home after smashing a window with a rock and shot him.

UTSanDiego.com reported that even though the 43-year-old real estate broker was wounded, he was able to wrestle the .45 caliber gun from Petersen’s hands and knock him over the head with it, according to police. 

Mr Petersen has been going through an acrimonious divorce with his wife, Bonnie, who is Fletcher's sister. According to court documents, the 49-year-old executive held a grudge against his brother-in-law, who was handling the sale of his home, accusing the realtor of accepting offers on his behalf without consulting him. 

Bonnie Fletcher told 10News Thursday that her soon-to-be former spouse turned abusive towards the end of their 12-year marriage, and she is convinced that during Wednesday's shooting spree he was searching for her.

Miss Fletcher described her husband as 'super smart' and 'wonderful', but said that about two years ago, he became violent after he stopped taking medication prescribed to him since his 1989 sky diving accident, in which he suffered head trauma.

The estranged wife said she became fearful of Petersen and filed for a restraining order, citing two separate incidents in which her husband allegedly hit her in the face while she was driving and put her in a chokehold.

The temporary order of protection expired in January. The couple’s divorce is currently in the process of being finalized.

Miss Fletcher has spent the past year staying with friends so her husband could not track her down and taking self-defense classes. The woman believes that had she been at her brother’s house Wednesday, Petersen would have killed her.

Following the shooting incident, a judge granted Bonnie Fletcher and her family a restraining order against Petersen.

Hans Petersen also has had a long relationship with the second victim, Steve Dowdy, who used to be his business partner and neighbor.

The two men had invested money together in Traversa Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the treatment of ovarian cancer, leukaemia and glioblastoma, which filed for bankruptcy last year.

Petersen, a graduate of University of San Diego, served as a postdoctoral researcher in Dowdy's lab, and the two worked together on ways to deliver drugs that target tumors without damaging healthy cells. 

NBC San Diego reported that the two former colleagues had a falling out over the failure of their joint business venture and were involved in a lawsuit.

According to the suspect's wife, Petersen blamed Mr Dowdy for his downfall because he had fired him, NBC San Diego reported.
