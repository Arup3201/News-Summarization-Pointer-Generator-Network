The mother of Michael Jackson said in court papers she was kept from communicating with outsiders while at a resort in Tucson and was unaware she had been reported missing.

Katherine Jackson declared in the documents obtained Thursday that she had no idea she was the subject of a search until she accidentally heard a television report.

She said she was told her doctor had ordered her to rest and she was flown to Arizona. At a spa, her cell phone was confiscated along with her iPad and she said she was kept in a room with no working phone or TV service.

Jackson, pictured in November, said she was planning to travel by 
motorhome to see her sons perform in New Mexico on July 14 when she was 
advised to fly instead, and ended up in Arizona

She said she asked about Michael's children and was told they were fine.

According to documents obtained by RadarOnline, Mrs Jackson said she was planning to travel by motorhome to
see her sons perform in New Mexico on July 14 when she was advised by a
doctor she should fly instead.

Radar reports Mrs Jackson recalled the
doctor arrived to her door 'stating he had been in contact with my 
longtime personal physician and was coming to check on me because my 
personal physician was unavailable.'

She continued: 'The doctor advised 
that it was better for me to fly and not drive to New Mexico. Believing 
that the doctor was sent at the request of my longtime personal 
physician, I followed what I understood to be a doctor's orders and 
boarded a flight as opposed to driving in the motorhome.'

Instead,
she was flown to Miraval Spa in Tucson. However, the matriarch did not 
specify who accompanied her there nor did she say who sent the doctor to
her home.

Sharing the load: TJ Jackson will share guardianship of his young cousins with his grandmother

The disclosure marked the latest 
development in a series of events that began when Katherine Jackson was 
reported missing last month but later turned up at the spa with family 
members.

The documents were released after a 
judge reinstated Katherine Jackson as the guardian of the children in an
arrangement that also keeps their cousin as temporary co-guardian.

Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff
said during a hearing that an investigator who looked into the 
children's care found that the late pop star's 82-year-old mother was an
excellent guardian and the children love her very much.

'I think the kids are in terrific 
hands,' the judge said. 'It appears from the report that Katherine 
Jackson has done a wonderful job and cares about the children very 
much.'

Beckloff noted that the children, 
Prince, 15, Paris, 14 and Blanket, 10, also have a close relationship 
with their 34-year-old cousin TJ Jackson, who was named temporary 
guardian last week after working closely with Katherine Jackson since 
Michael Jackson died.

TJ is 'incredibly respectful' of the family matriarch and she is respectful of him, the judge said.

Beckloff said he will finalize the 
arrangement later in the month but for now will issue letters of 
co-guardianship allowing both Jacksons to make decisions about the 
children's welfare.

TJ Jackson's new co-guardianship 
status is temporary, but the judge could make it permanent when he 
convenes the next court hearing on August 22.

The shared guardianship plan is 
apparently designed to remove pressure from Katherine Jackson who was 
previously named in her son's will as the children's sole guardian.

On the contrary: Mrs Jackson was surrounded last month by Janet, 
Jermaine, Rebbie and Rebbie's daughter - along with a manager
for the resort where was staying - to quell rumours she was held 
against her will

Emotional: Mrs Jackson read a statement claiming she was 'devastated' to lose custody and said she had been on a 'short vacation', contrary to her deposition

Perry Sanders Jr, her lawyer, has said
the arrangement will allow his client to focus on the children's 
upbringing and not on home or logistics issues.

Beckloff said then that he didn't 
believe Jackson had done anything wrong but suspended her guardianship 
duties because she had been out of contact with her grandchildren for 10
days.

Diana Ross was named by Michael Jackson in his will as a potential guardian of the children

The changes in guardianship come on 
the heels of family dissension over Michael Jackson's will, which left 
nothing to his siblings when he died three years ago. Several of them 
signed a letter that was leaked to the media alleging the will was a 
fake and calling on executors of the estate to resign.

The 
dispute at one point led to a driveway confrontation involving several 
family members at the Calabasas mansion where Katherine Jackson and the 
children have been living.

On Wednesday, Jermaine Jackson issued a plea for peace in the family and withdrew his support of the letter.

'Mistakes have been made and 
irrational things have been said on both sides in a highly charged 
emotional environment,' Jermaine Jackson wrote. 'It is time for us all 
to draw a line in the sand and move toward peace, co-operation, love and
healing.'

He wrote that the family is still raw 
from Michael Jackson's death, and his mother has endured incredible 
stress and pressures since then.

Next steps: Lawyers acting on behalf of the Jackson family and estate spoke about the latest hearing in Los Angeles today

Another party to the Jackson family 
drama, singer Diana Ross, who was named by Michael Jackson in his will 
as a potential guardian of the children if Katherine Jackson was not 
available, issued a statement saying the recent turmoil is a private 
matter and shouldn't be playing out publicly.

Ross and Jackson were longtime friends before his death in 2009.

Ross, who lives on the East Coast, 
came to California to visit with the Jackson family on Wednesday, 
Katherine Jackson's lawyer said, adding the singer supports the 
co-guardianship arrangement.

She has been given notice of court 
proceedings, but the new agreement apparently will relieve her of any 
possible guardianship duties, specifying that Katherine and TJ Jackson 
could replace each other if one or the other became unavailable to 
serve.

Mr Sanders told RadarOnline: 'Ms Ross 
met with Katherine, and the children yesterday. It was a very thoughtful
and pleasant meeting. Ms. Ross had no issues with signing off on the 
proposed new custody agreement.'

Meanwhile, Mrs Jackson's declaration 
directly contradicts statements she made in an ABC News interview, in 
which she said she voluntarily cut off communication with the outside 
world.

With her children Jermaine, Rebbie, 
and Janet - and the marketing manager of the resort where she was 
staying - the matriarch tried to explain: 'One reason I didn't call is I
just gave up my phone and I didn't want to have any phone calls while I
was here.'
