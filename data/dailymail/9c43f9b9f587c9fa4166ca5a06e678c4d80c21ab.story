A photographer has launched an appeal to reunite a family with their lost holiday pictures taken 40 years ago, after she bought a second-hand camera with undeveloped film.

Cali Teasel, 22, found colourful images on the Ensign Selfix 16-20 camera depicting a young family enjoying a sunny day in Llanfairfechan and Llandudno, two seaside resorts in north Wales.

She had purchased the device made by British camera-maker Houghton-Butcher from Lichfield Antiques Centre in Staffordshire - which is about 150 miles away from the two beaches.

Miss Teasel said: ‘I had no idea who the people were or where the photos were taken - and on a whim, wondered if social media could work its magic and solve some of the questions.

‘Within a few hours we had information that they were taken in Llanfairfechan in Wales.’

The Derby University photography student from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, bought the camera two months ago - and when she opened its back she noticed the film and the word 'exposed'.

She sent the film off to be developed and got the colourful pictures back two weeks ago, before launching a Facebook appeal to reunite the family with the photographs.

Miss Teasel's appeal has now been shared more than 1,000 times on social media. Of the surprising photographs, she added: ‘I was relieved to see that they weren't blurry photos of the pavement.

‘My father and I then looked at some of the other photos and wondered if they were taken in more than one place - as buildings and landmarks looked so different - and found out that some were taken in Llandudno too.

‘People from Wales that had seen my Facebook status later confirmed this through living there or by finding landmarks on Google Maps.’

‘The car is a Ford Zodiac Mk4 made between 1966 to 1972, so we're thinking more towards the early Seventies. Apparently only 1,000 were made and were given as prizes to competition winners.’
