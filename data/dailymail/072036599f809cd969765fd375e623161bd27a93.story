Kim Lehmkuhl, 34, accused of not doing her job as City Clerk resigned on Monday in a biting email

A Pleasant Hill, California city clerk accused of tweeting during City Council meetings instead of taking minutes has resigned from her 'depressing' job with a biting email wishing 'good luck' to the 'schmuck' who has to take her place.

Kim Lehmkuhl, 34, was elected as Pleasant Hill's clerk in 2012 and since has been criticized by the Mayor Tim Flaherty and other residents for writing opinionated Twitter updates during meetings instead of taking minutes. She was urged to resign.

Lehmkuhl eventually left her position and not with a whimper but a fiery bang.

IIn an email on Monday to Tim Flahrety she wrote, 'This has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone.'

Her burning email spewed even more pleasantries as she said, 'I wish the City the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote, and pathetic pandering attempt by Council.'

She called resident's comments during meetings 'racist' and filled with 'tinfoil hat' conspiracies.

In her message, she also said sardonically to June Catalano, the city manager, 'Best of luck with your imminent unfunded pensions scandal.'

'This has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone.'

Martin Nelis, a spokesman for the City of Pleasant Hill, shared the letter today.

Initially, Pleasant Hill Mayor Timothy Flaherty had replied graciously to Lehmkuhl's resignation, writing, 'Your decision is best for you and for the City of Pleasant Hill.'

But at the council meeting Monday night, he was less diplomatic, according to Nelis, saying, 'Our municipal nightmare is over.'

Lehmkuhl one threatened Flaherty by saying she would never resign.

Nelis said Lehmkuhl's failure to produce minutes had been a source of friction, and he believes this is the first instance of a city clerk resigning in the middle of her tenure.

'It's been an embarrassment, if anything, for the city,' Nelis said.

Residents had been urging the council to remove Lehmkuhl from office for months but since she was an elected official they could not immediately fire her. A Facebook page was created dedicated to tracking her lack of diligence in her job.

Residents noted that Lehmkuhl would tweet opinionated and 'inappropriate' observations during meetings.

Lemkuhl's Twitter as City Clerk has since been deleted.

In March, the council had agreed to place a measure on the November ballot to change the clerk's position from an elected one to an appointed one.

Despite her bitter exit, Lemkuhl once truly desired to work as City Clerk and even dedicated a website to her election for the position.

She goes on to state her qualifications and says that she attended Columbia law school and worked for three years at a public interest law firm in Berkley.

'I am committed to helping Pleasant Hill residents stay engaged in our community, and to keeping City Hall accountable, ethical and transparent. I would appreciate your support,' she wrote on her site hoping to be elected.

City Council member Micheal Harris told CBS that if he were Lehmkuhls new employer her would 'fire her on the spot.'

Lehmkuhl took a job in Washington, D.C., with Working America, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO that represents non-union workers according to her personal Twitter account.
