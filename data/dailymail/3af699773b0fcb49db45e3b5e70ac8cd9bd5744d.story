Manchester United's relationship with Nike finally hit rock bottom when the Barclays Premier League club began displaying branding from rivals manufacturers at their Carrington training ground earlier this year.

As the club announced today that their long relationship with Nike was about to come to an end after agreeing a new kit deal with arch rivals Adidas, it is understood that the manner United went about courting other companies back in January infuriated their current suppliers.

With their period of negotiating exclusivity with Nike at an end at the turn of the year, United exercised their right to talk to other companies and invited Adidas, Warrior and Puma to Carrington in successive days late in January.

Those meetings were revealed by Sportsmail at the time but what really annoyed Nike, though, was the way United laid out huge banners carrying their rivals' logos on the centre circles of Carrington training pitches.

With Carrington still a Nike-branded training centre, officials from the US-based firm saw the temporary displaying of Adidas, Warrior and Puma signs as deliberately and unnecessarily provocative.
