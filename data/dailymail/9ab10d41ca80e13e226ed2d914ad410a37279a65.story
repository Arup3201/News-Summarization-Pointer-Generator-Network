The lawyer of 7th Heaven actor Stephen Collins, who has been accused of sexually abusing young girls, says the 67-year-old's estranged wife tried to get a witness to lie in their divorce proceedings.

Wife Faye Grant allegedly demanded a witness tell the judge that she saw Collins molest a girl, but the witness did not see the incident and refused to testify, his attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan told TMZ.

The nation was shocked yesterday when the gossip site released recordings from a marriage therapy session between Collins and Grant, where the actor admits to exposing himself to at least three young girls between the ages of 10 and 13.

It appears Collins had some advance warning that the tapes were going to be released, as he was photographed talking nervously on the phone at New York's JFK airport on Monday, in images obtained by Inside Edition.  

It has now been revealed that the couple are fighting over more than $14million in their bitter divorce, and Collins' lawyer claims Grant has been trying to sell the tape for years in an attempt to get more alimony.

Bitter divorce: Faye Grant, estranged wife of 7th Heaven actor Stephen Collins, allegedly tried to get a witness to testify that her husband molested a young girl, but the person in question refused to appear in court because they did not witness the incident. The couple are currently in the middle of a bitter divorce and on Tuesday, audio recordings were released in which Collins admits to molesting at least three girls between the ages of 10 and 13

Among the assets detailed in divorce papers are $5million in property, Collins' $16,000 Rolex; $40,000 in art, Collins' $100,000 vintage guitar collection. 

In the documents, Grant adds that she has been left unable to support herself since she spent her peak acting careers at home taking care of their daughter and that she hasn't been able to book a job. 

But Collins' attorney claims that Grant has been racking up $20- and $40,000 dollar a month credit card bills, and having her estranged husband foot the bill.  

Grant herself says she did not release the tapes, but did give them to law enforcement two years ago just after the therapy session happened. 

Since the tapes were released this morning, reruns of 7th Heaven have been pulled from UP TV, and Collins lost his small role in the Ted sequel

She made even more explosive claims about her soon-to-be-ex husband on Wednesday, saying he had incestuous thoughts about their unborn child while she was pregnant.  

She says just before giving birth, Collins told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have sexually abused.

'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because "you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth" was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in the email obtained by TMZ.

'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added. 

But a source close to Collins told the gossip site that the allegations are 'absolutely untrue,' that he never received that email  and Grant never brought the claims up during their contentious divorce proceedings.

Collins' lawyer has not returned MailOnline's requests for comment as of Wednesday.

Collins is currently under investigation by the NYPD in response to the tapes.

The LAPD is collaborating with New York authorities, but they initially closed their own investigation into Collins two years ago after receiving the tapes themselves and finding 'no verified victim'.

In the recording, a man with Collins' distinct voice admits exposing himself to an 10-year-old relative of his first wife Marjorie Weinman, adding that he touched her as well. Collins and Weinman divorced in 1978. 

'There was one moment of touching where her hand...I put her her hand on my penis,' Collins says.

Collins goes on to admit exposing himself to several others girls. He says he exposed one girl 'a couple of times' when she was 11, 12 and 13.

'When you exposed yourself...did you have an erection?' Grant then asks.

'No, I mean, no. Partial, maybe, I think,' Collins responds.

Collins says he  exposed himself to a girl who lived in their Los Angeles neighborhood, who he tried apologizing to years later, and a New York girl who was 12 or 13 at the time.

The recordings were taken during a 2012 marriage therapy session that proved unsuccessful as Collins and his wife chose to file for divorce that year. The couple met filming a 1982 pilot called Tales of A Gold Monkey. They married three years later.

Grant talked about the moment they first met in an interview with People magazine in 1999.  

Collins starred as Rev Eric Camden on the long-running family drama about parents raising seven children. A still taken from the final episode in 2007

Actress Jessica Biel (second left) got her start in acting on the show. She is now married to Justin Timberlake 

'I thought, either he's gay or a complete jerk, because he can't be as fabulous as he looks and be available!' Grant told People. 

NYPD spokesman Stephen David says a complaint against Collins was filed in 2012, accusing him of forcing a then-14-year-old-girl to perform a lewd act in 1972. Davis says the case is open, but no charges have been filed. 

In the hours after the tapes were released Tuesday morning, Collins' life and career started falling apart as he was fired from a small role in the Ted sequel, was axed from a part in TV show Scandal and resigned from his position on the National Board for the Screen Actors Guild. 

Reruns of his hit show 7th Heaven, which ran from 1996-2007, have now been taken off the schedule at network UP TV and replaced with episodes of reality show Supernanny.  

And last night, police were called to the 67-year-old actor's Tarzana, California home after gun shots were heard inside the house. 

Collins' next-door neighbor, former Baywatch star Donna D'Errico tweeted shortly after 8pm that he had shot himself, and members of the media reported hearing a loud pop.

However, the reports turned out to be false and Collins wasn't even home at the time.

Collins is best known for his role as the minister dad on 7th Heaven, a show about a religious family raising a large brood of seven children. 

The actor talked about how much the role had an influence on his personal life in a People magazine interview from 1999, telling the magazine that he spent one Sunday a month as a lay eucharistic minister at Los Angeles Episcopalian church

'I guess life does imitate art!' he said. 

While most of the nation has swiftly come out against the actor, his 7th Heaven on-screen wife Catherine Hicks has come to his defense. 

She was filmed leaving a Santa Monica hospital on Tuesday, where she said there was never any indication he was a molester during more than a decade on set together - when they regularly acted with underage children. 

'Stephen is a good guy in my opinion,' Hicks said.

But that's not the portrait his estranged wife Grant has been painting in their messy divorce proceedings.

In bombshell divorce papers obtained by MailOnline, Grant claims her husband used his star power to trick abuse children.

'I believe that Stephen used his celebrity status to engender the trust of the families of the children he molested,' Grant wrote. 'I further believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those three girls.'

In the court filings Faye said she first learned of Collins' 'illness' in the presence of his therapist in January, 2012 – after 27 years of marriage.

Papers: Both Collins and Grant listed their separation date as February 1, 2012 in their initial divorce filings back in May of 2012 (above)

Bombshell: In November of 2013, Grant filed papers again since the divorce was taking too long to be finalized, where she revealed having learned of Collins' illness and asking that any legal liability Collins might have would not come out of her pocket

And according to the papers she spent 20 months coping with the trauma of his alleged abuse on children and worrying about her 'moral and legal responsibility'.

She said: 'Obviously I am sickened by Stephen's actions. I have urged Stephen multiple times to seek proper treatment for pedophilia.

'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.'

Grant has reportedly been using the taped therapy session as blackmail against Collins for years, in an attempt to get more  alimony from the actor. 

His attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told TMZ: 'Over the course of my representation of Stephen in the divorce case, Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than that to which she was legally entitled.

'When these demands were rebuffed, Faye attempted -- without success -- to peddle the tape in numerous ways to numerous different people. It appears that she has finally found an audience for this tape -- not surprisingly, on the eve of the trial in the divorce case where, again, she is seeking millions of dollars more than that to which she is legally entitled.

'Though we would like to address the tape itself, the circumstances dictate that we must regrettably refrain from doing so at this time.'
