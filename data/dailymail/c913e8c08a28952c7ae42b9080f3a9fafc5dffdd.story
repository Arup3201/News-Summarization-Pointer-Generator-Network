With his trademark windswept hair, cheeky grin and flashing cameras following him wherever he goes, even the most die-hard fan would be fooled into believing this is Harry Styles.

But this picture (below left) is actually just a schoolboy from Milton Keynes who looks so much like the singer he is mobbed in the street for autographs and has girls begging to marry him on Twitter.

Lookalike Jacob Skelton, 15, has become an internet sensation and famous in his own right after a friend posted a photo of him online pointing out his resemblance to the One Direction member.

The real deal: But while the pair have the same windswept hair and cheeky smile, Harry Styles, pictured, has green eyes while Jacob has brown eyes

He now has more than 11,000 followers on Twitter, is frequently stopped in the street by fans and has been invited as a guest on to TV talk shows.

Appearing on Daybreak this morning, the teenager said: 'People always ask for pictures with me on the street and on Twitter I've got a lot marriage proposals.'

He revealed how he never even knew who Harry Styles was and had never watched X Factor - the show which saw the singer's band One Direction catapulted to fame - before a friend's mother claimed he looked like 18-year-old Styles.

He said: 'I went to knock for my friend before school and One Direction were on TV and my friends mum looked at One Direction and then she looked at me and said I looked like him.

Guess who: Harry Styles lookalike Jacob Skelton,
pictured left at the ITV studios, has become an internet sensation 
because he so closely resembles the 18-year-old One Direction singer,

The centre of attention: The teenager didn't answer when asked if the attention had gone to his head, but just screwed up his nose

'I don't think I looked that much like him but she said I did and from there people have just said I do.'

The teen revealed that his went from being a complete unknown to having 10,000 followers on Twitter in less than two months after a friend posted a picture of him on the website.

He told The Sun: 'I’ve been getting hundreds of new 
followers every day, saying things like, "You look so much like Harry 
Styles, please marry me?".'

And privacy is becoming a thing of the past for Jacob - just as it already is for his famous doppelganger.

He told the newspaper: 'When I go out I get stared at all the time. And when I’m down the park I get girls in their 20s coming up to me.

No more privacy: Jacob says he is stared at when he goes out and has even been followed around a zoo

'I even got followed around Whipsnade Zoo by some girls who asked for a photo with me.'

Asked on Daybreak whether he had 
altered his hair to look more like the singer, Jacob replied: 'No, my 
hair's been like this since I was about 10.'

The
teen from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire then admitted the attention 
may have gone to his head slightly by screwing up his nose at a question
asked by presenter Aled Jones.

His
father Karl added that while he hoped his son would be able to use his 
new found fame to his advantage, school still comes first.

Hopes for the future: Karl Skelton said he hopes his son can make a career out of looking like the singer but added he needs to finish school first

Doppelganger: Daybreak Tweeted this picture of Jacob and told Harry Styles fans the lookalike would be appearing on the show

He said: 'I think he can have a career but we've got to take it easy, he still has school.

'We will be looking into either doing a lookalike agency or maybe he could do modelling for clothes in the magazines.'

And just like his son, property developer Karl had no idea who Harry Styles was before he made Jacob famous.

He said: 'It's amazing really. I saw a picture of Harry Styles on a magazine on someone's coffee table and I had to do a double take.

'Everyone said he looked like Harry Styles and I wasn't really bothered, I didn't know who he was, until I saw that.'
