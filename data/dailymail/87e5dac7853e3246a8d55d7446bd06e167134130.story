British No1 Heather Watson threw away three match points as she was knocked out of the Aegon Classic in Edgbaston in the first round on Tuesday.

Watson squandered a 5-3 lead in the second set and failed to close out the match on her own serve against Aleksandra Wozniak from Canada, ranked 66 places below her in the world.

The 22-year-old battled back from 3-0 down in the final set to level at 4-4, but Wozniak needed only one match point to seal the clash in 2hrs 12mins.

Pushed to the limit: Watson won the first set before losing the next two

Eyes on the prize: Wozniak fought back after falling 6-2, 4-1 down to progress

Change of fortune: Watson was pumped up early on but the game got away from her the longer it went on

Watson, who
 was watched by Britain's Fed Cup captain Judy Murray, insisted the loss
 will not disrupt her preparations for Wimbledon, where she will largely
 carry British hopes in the women's draw in the absence of Laura Robson.

Watson,
 the world No. 69, said: 'No, it's just a match. You know, I'm still 
alive. I'll play another match next week. I'll play another one even 
maybe tomorrow. It's no big deal.

'About
 the middle of the second set I stopped serving as well, so then I got 
pushed back and wasn't playing as aggressively as I wanted to.

'She
 definitely improved her game. At the beginning she was making a lot of 
unforced errors, and then in the third set she played unbelievable. She 
was hitting lines and net cords. There wasn't much I could do.'

Moving on: Wozniak will now face Britain's Johanna Konta in the second round

Back to basics: Watson is confident she will be ready to go for Wimbledon later this month

Talking tactics: Watson chats with coach Diego Veronelli between sets

Wozniak
 will now face Britain's Johanna Konta in the second round in 
Birmingham, after the 23-year-old beat 14th seed Kurumi Nara from Japan 
6-3 6-1.

Naomi Broady, however, was another British casualty in the first round at the Edgbaston Priory Club, losing 5-7 6-4 6-3.

Watson said: 'Tried my best to hang in there but wasn't able to finish it. She played unbelievable.'
