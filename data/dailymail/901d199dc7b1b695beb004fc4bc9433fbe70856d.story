A woman so inspired by the plight of a young girl dying from cancer shed 11st in order to help other people battling the disease.

Encouraged by a tweet from terminally ill Alice Pyne, Karen Mitchell created her own 'bucket list', which included losing weight and 
saving lives.

Pride Of Britain winner Alice, who had fought Hodgkin's lymphoma from the age 
of 12, took to social media to urge people to join the bone marrow 
register.

Karen Mitchell shed 11st 7lb after promising a dying teenager she would join the bone marrow register

After seeing it - and being deeply moved by the teenager's blog - Ms Mitchell decided she too would sign up to donate her stem cells 
and save lives.

But at 25st and with a BMI of 60 - well above the healthy limit of 25 - she was rejected.

Determined to fulfill her pledge, she even sent Alice a tweet, promising she would lose 
weight to join the register.

Alice replied, urging her not to 
give up  - and Ms Mitchell has since lost 11st 7lb.

She said: 'I thought Alice was incredibly brave and inspiring and when I read her tweet encouraging people to join the bone marrow register, I knew straight away that I wanted to do something for
 her.

'Being rejected was a turning point because here
 was this amazing young woman who was terminally ill yet doing all she 
could to help others – and I was just wasting my life being fat.

'I couldn't even walk up the stairs at work without becoming out of 
breath. I felt useless. Now my weight was stopping me doing one thing 
for Alice.'

Next week she will make a life-saving donation in memory of Alice, who died in January 2013.

'Alice told me not to give up and I
 didn't want to let her down,' said Ms Mitchell. 'Her amazing legacy can go on
 saving lives and I hope everyone reading this will donate as well – not
 for me, but for Alice.'

Ms Mitchell's weight loss was inspired by the Alice Pyne, who was dying from cancer and urging people to join the bone marrow register. But at 25st, she was too fat - so tweeted Alice promising to lose weight

Ms Mitchell, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, had battled with her weight for as long as she could remember - spending her teenage years wearing size 18 clothes.

'I longed to wear trendy clothes like the other girls at my school but I could only shop in the 'fat' section of shops,' she said.

By the time she married at 27, she walked down the aisle in a size 28 wedding dress - but says she knew the five-year marriage was doomed.

'In my heart I knew I wasn't right for him and he wasn't right for me. But I was a big girl and I told myself it would probably be my only chance to get married and settle down. I hoped we could make it work.'

She went on to find love again - but blissfully happy with new partner Dan Hague, she piled on even more weight.

After four years together, by 2012 her weight had peaked at 25st and Dan's had rocketed up from 14st to 19st 8lb.

'We were just so happy together,' she says. 'We enjoyed going for drinks and meals and cooking together, but it was always really high-calorie, bad foods.'

Ms Mitchell had battled with her weight all her life - and by the time she promised to join the register she was 25st with a BMI of 60

After meeting partner Dan Hague, she piled on more weight due to the couple's love of fatty food and drinks

ogether they weighed a whopping 44st 8lb and attracted cruel insults wherever they went.

But Ms Mitchell, who works in a fizzy drinks factory, was still shocked when she tried to join the bone marrow register after reading about Alice and was turned down.

To join the register, donors needed a BMI below 30, but hers was 60. So she sent Alice a tweet that read: 'I promise to lose weight so I can join the register'.

And to her total surprise, Alice tweeted back, saying 'please do it'.

Spurred on, Ms Mitchell said: 'I told myself that this time I would lose the weight. But it felt like such an impossibly huge mountain to climb.

'I wanted to lose 11st, so that meant more than half my body weight had to go. I wondered how on earth I could ever manage to do it.'

The couple embarked on a weight loss challenge and between them, have lost 17st

She joined a local Slimming World group and swapped takeaways for vegetable stir-fries, salads and fresh fruit for chocolate bars and crisps.

And as the weight slowly started to fall off, she continued to follow Alice on Twitter as she ticked off all the wishes on her bucket list, which included meeting Take That and whale watching.

'I followed her doing all the incredible things she had on her list and, like all her thousands of followers, I just thought her courage and bravery were amazing.'

To keep on track, she decided that she too would write a list containing all the reasons she wanted to lose weight.

Dubbed the 'Belly Bucket List', objectives included being able to climb the stairs at work, wear high heels, see her nieces grow up, fly in a plane without a seat belt extender and fit into a chair.

She also started her own blog to keep her motivated and began to upload the photographs of every healthy meal she ate.

By January 2013, when Alice tragically died, aged just 17, Ms Mitchell had lost 5st.

'I was devastated to hear the news - but all I could do was vow to carry on dieting until I could join that register as I had promised.'

To speed up her weight loss, she began also took up running - and before long, partner Dan also joined the weight loss challenge.

'There was some healthy competition between us, which definitely helped,' said Ms Mitchell. 'We had a scoreboard in the kitchen and
 whoever lost the least weight that week had to cook for the other.

By last summer, she was able to cross off number 14 on the Bucket Belly List - sitting in a deckchair.

She said: 'It might sound a bit daft, but just to be able to sit down without 
worrying if I would fit into the chair or not felt really fantastic.

'I'd never been able to just sit down in a chair before because usually I wouldn't fit, especially if it had arms.'

Another milestone moment came when she was able to buy tights that were labelled 'one size only'.

Now, 18 months after Alice died,she has lost 11st 7lbs and weighs 13st 7lbs. Her BMI is now 31.

Mr Hague has gone from 19st 8lb to 13st 8lb – a loss of 6st,

While Ms Mitchell is too old to be a bone marrow donor for the Anthony Nolan charity -the limit is 30 - next week she and Mr Hague will be donating their bone marrow stem cells via the National Blood Service.

'One thing Alice used to say that has stuck with me is, " You only have one life, so live it", and, thanks to her brave example, that is exactly what I am doing,' she said.

'Her courage and optimism not only inspired me, it transformed me and I hope to encourage people to sign the register like me just as Alice wished.'
