Arsene Wenger has fuelled talk of a potential future move for Porto striker Jackson Martinez by implying he will be the next big player to leave the club.

The Portuguese giants have notoriously sold their stars to Europe's biggest clubs for hefty transfer fees in recent times with Ricardo Carvalho, Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez just three examples of their policy.

And speaking to beIN Sports as part of an interview about Porto, the Arsenal boss was full of praise about their prized asset - adding that the striker would equip himself well in England's top flight.

'[He has] top physical strengths,' Wenger said about Martinez. 'Hugely efficient, he is the kind of player who can make room for himself in the box.

'He could play in the Premier League because he has the body to make the difference. He uses it in a very intelligent way. Very short back lift and he's a very good finisher.'

'He's on the list of many clubs, you know that. He will be the next big transfer who will give a big smile to Pinto da Costa [Porto's owner].'

Earlier in the week, Martinez revealed that he plans to leave Porto in the summer amid rumours that Manchester United are interested in acquiring his signature.

The 28-year-old has scored 85 goals in just two-and-a-half seasons at the Estadio do Dragao.
