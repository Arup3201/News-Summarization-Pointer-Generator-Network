A Liverpool fan who bears an uncanny resemblance to Luis Suarez  is begging his fellow supporters to leave him alone after continually being mistaken for the star striker. 

The Iraqi man, who has not been named, is such a dead ringer for Uruguayan Suarez he is constantly pestered by fans demanding photos and autographs.

Things came to a head last weekend when he flew in to watch Liverpool take on Arsenal and struggled to get anyway near Anfield because he was being mobbed by supporters.

Double take: An Iraqi Liverpool fan bears such an uncanny resemblance to the team's star striker Luis Suarez he is being constantly mobbed by fans

I'm not Suarez! The Iraqi Suarez recently flew to watch Liverpool play but struggled to get anywhere near Anfield because he was constantly being mobbed by supporters

He was pictured watching the match 
by the Al Arabiya TV channel who later filmed an hilarious video in 
which he was forced to insist: 'I'm not Suarez'.

He said: 'When I was in the UK everyone, even the children, said, "This is Suarez" – the whole street.

'And I always say, ‘I’m not Suarez.

'People there are crazy and I have to keep saying "I’m not Suarez, please don’t touch me".'

Goal: The Iraqi Suarez now says he wants to meet the striker and have his picture taken with him

But if anything the video only appears to have made the problem worse after being viewed almost 90,000 times on YouTube.

And the doppelganger managed to complicate the issue even further when he posed for pictures with Suarez's Liverpool strike partner Daniel Sturridge.

It is not clear whether Sturridge himself was fooled by the resemblance.  

The Iraqi Suarez says he now wants to meet the famous striker claims  so he can pose for a picture.
