There are those whom Father Time chooses to bless... and to say he has been generous to Christie Brinkley would be a vast understatement.

In her 1980s prime she was a supermodel before the word had even been invented, and today, just three months shy of her 60th birthday, she looks almost exactly the same as she did when she starred in the video of Uptown Girl, the song her now-ex husband Billy Joel wrote for her.

Christie has grown accustomed to exclamations of amazement over her appearance and finds what she calls the ‘pushing 60 obsession’ hilarious. Less amusing, however, is the frequent assumption that her life is without problems.

In fact, she and her family have been through a very modern ordeal, one that underlines just how much the world of celebrity has changed.

Indeed, her daughter with Billy Joel, Alexa Ray, was rushed to hospital following a suicide attempt – a victim, Christie says today, of the now pervasive culture of vicious online bullying, or ‘trolling’.

No wonder the model says it is now time to the insidious internet anonymity that allows people to persecute others without consequence.

Alexa, now 27, was already in a fragile state of mind in 2009 following a break-up with a boyfriend when the bullying began, explains Christie. And in her delicate condition, the online taunts about her appearance and talent were enough to push her over the edge.

Recently, Alexa – a budding singer-songwriter who hopes to follow in the footsteps of her father – singled out gossip blogger Perez Hilton as being one of the worst culprits, saying: ‘They used to pick on my looks and I used to care too much about how they perceived me. Perez Hilton labelled me a slut. I know what it feels like to be bullied .  .  . on a very large scale.’

Sitting in her sprawling home in The Hamptons, Long Island, Christie makes no attempt to hide her distress as she describes the traumatic events that hit the family.

Star parents: Alexa attracted criticism from online bullies who accused her of cashing on the fame of her parents Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley

Choked with emotion, she says: ‘What Alexa has to deal with, what she’s been through, is the most upsetting thing I’ve ever had to face. As a parent you want to protect your child. Your whole life revolves around wanting to keep your kids safe, happy and healthy. That’s your goal. And when you have these evil, hurtful forces that you can’t protect them from it’s just agonising.’

Describing Alexa as a ‘sensitive, late-blossoming child’, she says her daughter was deeply wounded by the constant criticism she received, purely as a result of being the daughter of famous parents.

Christie remembers one particularly vicious comment: ‘They said she looks like the father and sings like the mother.’ It is a mentality that is incomprehensible to her.

She says: ‘It bothers me as a human that our society has got to this level. My daughter is a beautiful, talented person. Now she has blossomed, looks-wise, they say, “Oh, it’s all plastic surgery”. She had a tweak on her nose and that’s the only thing she’s ever had done.

‘But what bothers me on a personal level is Alexa seems to be under so much scrutiny and she’s just a kid. We’ve turned into a society which is used to focusing on the negative. We should be supporting each other.’

Bullies have also attacked Christie’s youngest daughter Sailor, now 15, who has recently taken her first tentative steps into the modelling world.

Christie – who also has an 18-year-old son, Jack – may be an internationally famous model and actress, but she sounds like any ordinary mother when she speaks about her concerns.

‘It’s a different world today to the one I grew up in,’ she says. ‘Bullying follows children home. The invasiveness is new and every parent is trying to deal with it.

‘I call it “the other people at the table”. You have to share your kids with the computer and the mobile phone and you don’t have as much influence as a parent any more because these other people are in your kids lives 24/7.

'Driving to and from school was my time to talk to the children in the same way my parents talked to me. Now I say something and I hear ‘uh huh’ and I look in the rear view mirror and my children are texting.’

She says she first discovered the online bullies while going through a bitter divorce from Sailor’s father, architect Peter Cook. During their court battle it was revealed he spent thousands on internet porn and cheated on her with the 18-year-old daughter of  a neighbour.

‘The blogosphere is the meanest, nastiest place in the world,’ she says. ‘I was never in the computer world until my last divorce. For the very first time I got on to the computer and started trawling. I looked at some of the stories and would scroll down to the comments.

‘I’d never even heard of some of the words they were using. I was shocked. I discovered the internet  is where people with chips on their shoulders can assume a fake identity and just spew venom and bitterness.’

She has been shocked to discover that every stage of her children’s lives has been documented in often cruel detail, but says she now does not even read the comments: ‘At this point none of us go there. We do not look.’

Christie admits she uses social networks to keep her fans up to date – and believes ensuring everyone is identifiable online is the answer. ‘I think people need to operate on the worldwide web as themselves,’ she says. ‘I think that’s the solution. We should insist that they use their real identity – like a driver’s licence.

‘People need to be responsible and accountable for their actions and what they have to say about people.’

Trim: The 59-year-old supermodel is the same height and weighs the same as her 15-year-old daughter

She can’t have failed to notice the attention her own appearance receives online. In her case, most of the comment are positive,  yet she is keen to downplay the obsession with her age.

‘I’m not the only 59-year-old who looks good,’ she says. ‘I think there are millions of fit, fabulous 59-year-old women out there but they  are telling everyone they’re 49. Women should own their age. We shouldn’t fudge the figures.’

Christie has never commented previously on rumours her good looks could have had artificial help, but today, for the first time, she admits to experimenting with Botox – but says: ‘It’s not for me.‘I didn’t like the feeling. I like to make lots of faces. I like to hold up my eyebrows. When I couldn’t move my forehead it made me feel depressed.

'I looked like a boxer who had taken a blow to the head. Plastic surgery is up to an individual. I would caution young girls not to go there. You see people with overinflated lips and overinflated cheeks. I think that look is ageing rather than anti-ageing.’

She is proud of the fact that she and her 15-year-old daughter – both 5ft 9in – weigh exactly the same. ‘We share clothes but it’s a different weight distribution. She’s a smaller jean size. I’ve got child-bearing hips’.

Christie has followed a vegetarian diet since the age of 12 and works out regularly in her home gym. Two years ago, she played Roxie Hart in the West End and Broadway production of Chicago, receiving plaudits for her stamina.

She does admit to using ‘tricks’ to improve her appearance, including clip-in hair extensions, which she is selling through the hair2wear.com company.

‘I started using them during Chicago. I’d come off stage and my head would be a mess. I’d take off my Roxy wig and my hair would be wet at the side and the centre was a springy mess. I’d put on a wig or pull my hair back and put on a ponytail. It’s a simple trick all women can use to look and feel better about themselves.’

She says she will never marry again but refused to comment on whether there is a man in her life, saying: ‘Some things are private.’ She is famously still close to Billy Joel, who this week embarks on a British tour, and speaks about him with warmth.

‘When Alexa was a baby I’d put her on his piano lid because I wanted the music to vibrate through her body and infuse her with his talent. As she grew up that was her favourite place.

‘Billy did a concert with Bruce Springsteen for President Obama and I stood in the wings with Obama. Alexa walked out on stage and Billy picked her up and put her on the lid of his piano.

‘The President said to me, “Isn’t that wonderful? I can’t believe I’m here with you,” and I said, “Mr President, I can’t believe  I’m here with you.” ’
