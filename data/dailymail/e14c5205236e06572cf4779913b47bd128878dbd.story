Republic of Ireland midfielder Keith Andrews, 33, will hold talks with Watford on Wednesday regarding a season-long loan from fellow Championship club Bolton Wanderers.

Andrews impressed last season on loan with Brighton & Hove Albion,

However, the experienced midfielder is not part of manager Dougie Freedman’s plans at Bolton as he tries to build a younger team.

Ironically, Watford and Bolton meet on the opening weekend of the Championship season on August 9 but Andrews wouldn’t be allowed to play under the loan conditions.

Andrews has played for 11 clubs in his career and played 35 times for Ireland including games at Euro 2012.
