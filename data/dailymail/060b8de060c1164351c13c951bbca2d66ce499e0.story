Kissed and fondled: Camilla Long claimed she was shamefully molested by Dave Lee Travis in 2012

Just five months before he was first arrested, the writing was on the wall for Dave Lee Travis.

The Sunday Times published a graphic account by journalist Camilla Long of how he shamelessly molested her in front of his wife.

The columnist asked for an interview because he was about to meet the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. 

But she was left giggling ‘out of horror and fear’ during an unforgettable exchange in which the then 67-year-old entertainer took every opportunity to touch her.

‘I spent 90 minutes with the former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and I don’t think there is a part of my body that he didn’t grope,’ the resulting article began.

‘He fondled my foot, inched his hands up my thighs, tried to make me sit on his lap and kissed me.

‘He copped a feel of my hips when I foolishly asked for a tour of his studio, stroked my chin and my back and gave me a full body hug as I left.’

When police went public on their investigation, they asked Miss Long if she would support a prosecution or give evidence but she declined.

Speaking last night after he was convicted, she said: ‘He didn’t worry about getting consent too much, he just did it.’

That damning June 2012 interview took place more than four decades after Travis first rose to fame as a Radio 1 DJ and Top of the Pops presenter.

But it lays bare exactly how a bearded pipe-smoking hippy believed he had the right to behave exactly as he pleased in the company of women.

In court, Travis described himself as having a ‘cuddly nature’ and happily admitted to loving ‘wonderful’ women who have ‘fabulous shapes’. ‘If I like someone I will hug them and give them a kiss because the whole world needs that,’ he told the jury benignly.

He declared that ‘half the country would be in jail’ if patting a woman’s bottom was a crime in the 1970s as he dismissed his accusers as ‘fantasists’.

In reality, his sexually-charged advances were unwanted and investigators suspect there are many more victims who have not come forward.

In fact, it was Travis’s own bravado which helped secure his place in the dock, for not one but two criminal trials. The day after his arrest, the DJ could not resist coming out of his prized Buckinghamshire bungalow to face the TV cameras and proclaim his innocence.

He had only been accused of ‘squeezing the boobs of a couple of women’, he protested. But the sight of Travis, puffed up with self-righteousness and labelling himself an ‘easy target’, prompted another flurry of women to contact police.

Dave Lee Travis on The Mrs Merton show in 1995: It was behind the scenes of this appearance that Travis was found by a jury to have groped the breasts of young researcher, who is now a broadcaster herself

The majority of those went to trial in February but he was cleared on 12 counts. The jury was unable to decide on two counts which were the subject of the most recent trial plus the case of a researcher for the Mrs Merton show.

He was found guilty of assaulting the researcher but cleared on both the other cases.

While playing Aladdin’s evil uncle in a pantomime, Travis was accused of ‘engulfing’ a stage hand in his costume cloak and forcing his hand down her tracksuit bottoms.

The allegation resulted in The Chuckle Brothers – his co-stars in the 1990 panto at a theatre in Crawley, Sussex – coming to court in his defence.

They were said to have unwittingly saved the young woman from his clutches by interrupting the assault in his dressing room.

The stage hand claimed Travis pinned her to the door and groped her ‘from top to toe’ as he towered over her.

She told jurors he then forced his hand down her tracksuit bottoms and into her knickers – only stopping when one of the slapstick comedians – aka Paul and Barry Elliott - was heard saying ‘All right Dave’.

Assistant theatre manager Simon Gant told the court that Travis had such a ‘threatening presence’ that girls on the early 1990s production agreed that none would be left alone with him. Mr Gant added: ‘He would come up behind them and put the cloak around them.’

But the Chuckle Brothers, now in their 60s, came to court to defend DLT, saying he was a ‘jolly great chap to work with’ and that they could not remember any such incident.

The jurors rejected the woman’s claims and found Travis not guilty.

The DJ was also accused of groping the breasts of a journalist who was interviewing him as his wife slept upstairs.

The former BBC DJ invited the 24-year-old feature writer to his luxury home in 2008 to reminisce about a Radio 1 Christmas party with stars including Jimmy Savile and John Peel, for a nostalgia feature. He allegedly told the young interviewer she had a good figure and asked if she would like to pose for a semi-naked photograph for him.

She claimed he pawed at her cleavage before cocking his head to one side, as if he was judging the size of her breasts.

The former Top Of The Pops presenter denied her claims, telling jurors the women had been lying, but she told them it was true and she would stake her life on it.

Her claims have been tested by juries in two separate trials, and both were unable to agree – meaning Travis was formally found not guilty of the charge.
