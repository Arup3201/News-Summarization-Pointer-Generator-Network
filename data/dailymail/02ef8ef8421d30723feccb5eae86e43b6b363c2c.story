Thomas Muller celebrated a hat trick against Portugal but he cannot be proud of all he did in the game.

His over-reaction to Pepe’s stray arm, which deserved a yellow card, was unnecessary but as acknowledged by ITV pundit Patrick Vieira, is part of the modern game.

Pepe of course should not have reacted to the German’s theatrics and in doing so let his team down and left the Serbian referee, Milorad Mazic, with no option but to send him off.

Referees have been criticised for the decisions at the start of this World Cup but players are making their jobs much harder than they need to. I would like to have seen Muller cautioned for his reaction to a brush by Pepe.

Referees are trying to keep their cards in their pockets and allow the players some latitude which for the spectacle of the competition and for fans is appreciated but could have repercussions as the competition goes on.

Certainly Portuguese defender Joao Pereira benefited from this when he pulled Mario Gotze back when clean through and heading towards goal.

It looked a clear denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity but Mazic only showed a yellow card!

Benefit of the doubt: Joao Pereira (right) was only cautioned for this foul on Mario Gotze
