The average British person spend 315 days a year hungover. Many surveyed said they had missed dates, job interviews and even funerals as a result

Recovering from a big night out? The average British person spends almost a year of their lives nursing a hangover, a charity has said.

Macmillan Cancer Support has estimated that people spend 315 days of their lives battling with headaches and nausea caused by drinking.

The charity surveyed 2,000 British adults and found that one in 14 will have more than 3,000 hangovers in their lifetime.  

It calculated the figures by multiplying the average amount of time people spend hungover each month with their life expectancy.

The new poll  revealed a north-south divide with the frequency of hangovers, with 22 per cent of people from the north likely to have more than four hangovers each month compared to 15 per cent of people from the south.

Women's hangovers appear to last longer - with the average lasting nine hours - compared to a seven hour hangover suffered by men.

The study suggests that being hungover could jeopardise your chance of finding romance or getting your dream job.

One in every 13 of those surveyed said they had missed a first date because they were too hungover and one in ten said they had missed a job interview.

Shamefully, eight per cent of those surveyed admitted they had missed a wedding thanks to a hangover, and six per cent admitted they had missed a funeral.

Over half said the most annoying aspect of being hungover was that it made them feel sick while more than a quarter said wasting time was their biggest bugbear.

Of those who complained about a hangover being a waste of time, a quarter said if they weren't hungover they'd have more sex.

A hangover also prevented people from taking part in more edifying activities.

A further 16 per cent said they'd learn a language, 41 per cent said they'd exercise more and 13 per cent said they'd learn an instrument.

Forget hair of the dog, an Iraqi stew from a 1,000-year-old Middle Eastern recipe book claims to be the 'ultimate hangover cure'.

The 1,000-year-old Iraqi dish involves cooking meat with vegetables and spices, and then adding something known as 'kashk'.

Kashk is combination of fermented yoghurt, milk and whey, and is common in Iranian, Turkish, Balkan and Arabic food.

The ancient book also advises eating cabbage before going out drinking.

The charity is running a 'Go Sober for October' fundraising campaign to encourage people to give up drinking and raise money.

'This research shows hangovers are a waste of time and are causing people to miss out on everything from romance to their dream job,' said Hannah Redmond, head of national events marketing for Macmillan Cancer Support.

'That's why we're asking people to sign up for Macmillan's Go Sober fundraising event, abstain from drinking alcohol for the month of October and ask family and friends to sponsor them. The money raised will provide vital funds to support people affected by cancer so they don't have to face it alone.'
