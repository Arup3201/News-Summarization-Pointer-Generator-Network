David Cameron said the use of chemical weapons in Syria crossed a 'red line' for Britain and its allies

There is 'growing evidence' that the Syrian government has committed war crimes against its own people by using chemical weapons in the country’s brutal civil war, David Cameron warned today.

If it is confirmed Syrian forces had used the weapons, the regime of beleaguered President Bashar al Assad would have crossed what the Prime Minister called the ‘red line’ opening the way for  Britain and its allies to intervene in the two-year conflict.

Mr Cameron said he did not think it was 'likely' that UK troops would be sent in to Syria, but vowed to send a 'very clear warning' to the government that the 'appalling actions' would not be tolerated'.

It is understood that Britain has obtained samples from inside Syria that have been tested by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, Wiltshire.

Further samples of hair and soil suspected of containing the nerve agent sarin and to have been used in an attack near the city of Aleppo 13 days ago are said to have been also passed to scientists.

Intelligence gleaned by both the UK and US indicated there is evidence that Assad’s forces had used the weapons and in particular sarin, officials said.

Barack Obama has previously said the use of chemical weapons would be a 'red line' for the US to intervene.

Mr Cameron said: 'There is growing evidence that we've seen of the use of chemical weapons, probably by the regime, it's extremely serious.

'This is a war crime and we should take it very seriously.'

He said the government was being 'careful not to make the mistake sometimes made in the past' by rushing claims into the domain domain, seen as a reference to Tony Blair's claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

Mr Cameron told BBC Breakfast: 'We're trying to consider the evidence with our allies, make sure that we can verify it, but this is extremely serious and I think what President Obama said was absolutely right, t that this should form for the international community a red line for us to do more.'

Today two Syrian officials denied the government has used chemical weapons against rebel forces, saying the regime had no need for them.

Syrian official Sharif Shehadeh called the U.S. claims 'lies' and likened them to false accusations that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the U.S. invasion of that country.

Britain has led calls for the international community to step up its support for rebel forces battling to overthrow Assad.

But this week there were warnings 
that British nationals joining the fighting in Syria were being 
radicalised by violent Islamist groups and could launch terror attacks 
when they return home.

Mr Cameron added: 'I’ve always been keen for us to do more, we’re working with the opposition, we want our allies and partners to do more with us to shape that opposition, to make sure we’re supporting people with good motives, who want a good outcome to put pressure on that regime so that we can bring it to an end.'

He insisted he did not 'want to see' British troops sent in to Syria, but said a clear message had to be sent to the Syrian government.

'I don’t want to see that and I don’t think that is likely to happen but I think we can step up the pressure on the regime, work with our partners, work with the opposition in order to bring about the right outcome.

'But we need to go on gathering this evidence and also to send a very clear warning ot the Syrian regime about these appalling actions.'

Claims: U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said intelligence sources 
had confirmed the use of Sarin gas by the Syrian government during a 
press conference in Abu Dhabi today

It comes after both the US and Britain went public last night with claims that chemical weapons had been used.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We have 
limited but persuasive information from various sources showing chemical
 weapon use in Syria, including sarin. This is extremely concerning.

'Use of chemical weapons is a war 
crime. We have briefed our allies, partners and the UN on this 
information and we are working actively to get more and better 
information.

'(Bashar) Assad must cooperate with 
the international community and prove that his regime has not committed 
this horrific crime, allowing unrestricted access for the UN and OPCW 
(Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) to investigate on
 the ground in Syria.'

The British claims came minutes after
 US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said US intelligence had concluded 
with ‘some degree of varying confidence’ that Assad’s forces have used 
chemical weapons on a ‘small scale’.

He added: 'The intelligence community has been assessing information for some time on this issue and the decision to reach this conclusion was made within the past 24 hours.'

US Secretary of State John Kerry 
suggested Assad’s forces had ‘launched’ two chemical attacks. No 
information was made public on what quantity of chemical weapons might 
have been used, or when or what casualties might have resulted.

White House sources stressed that more information was needed and the current assessments were not enough.

Warning: U.S. President Barack Obama has said that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would be a 'game changer' while Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said
the West will pay a price 'in the heart' of Europe and the U.S. for 
their alleged backing Islamic fundamentalists

Washington called for a UN investigation but former presidential candidate John McCain said the West should intervene.

‘What I worry about is that now... 
that Bashar Assad has crossed the red line that the president has 
established and we don’t take action,’ he said. ‘Iranians, Hezbollah, 
others in the region will be paying close attention.’

The CIA believes Syria has had a 
chemical weapons programme for years. There is grave concern in the UK 
and US that its stockpile of chemical weapons – approximately 1,000 
tons, stored in 50 towns – could fall into the hands of Al Qaeda to be 
turned on Western targets.

The Foreign Office called on Assad to cooperate with international bodies to prove he had not sanctioned their use.

In an escalation of the war in 
Afghanistan, the RAF has carried out unmanned drone missions against the
 Taliban from British soil for the first time.

The Reaper drones are controlled from
 RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. The Ministry of Defence said they had 
supported ground troops with ‘armed intelligence and surveillance 
missions’.

No information was made public on 
what quantity of chemical weapons might have been used, or when or what 
casualties might have resulted.

President
 Barack Obama has said the use of chemical weapons would be a 
'game-changer' in the U.S. position on intervening in the Syrian civil 
war, and the letter to Congress reiterates that the use or transfer of 
chemical weapons in Syria is a 'red line for the United States.'

However, the letter also hints that a broad U.S. response is not imminent.

There have been four reports in recent months of  chemical weapons being deployed by the Assad regime.

Syria
 is thought by the CIA to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons 
thought to include sarin and mustard gas that can be deployed using 
aircraft, ballistic missiles and artillery rocket.

Both the rebel forces and Assad's regime have accused each other of using them and there have been reports from iside Syria of containers, possibly conatining Sarin, being dropped from the air.

Fears have grown in recent months for the safety of the stockpile. It is also believed that Syria has attempted to develop more toxic nerve agents.

And Syria's president al-Assad warned 
the West will pay a price 'in the heart' of Europe and the U.S. for 
their alleged backing Islamic fundamentalists in his country's civil 
war.

UK Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last week that a soil sample taken from Khan al-Assad had tested positive for a chemical agent.

Earlier this week UK foreign secretary Mr Hague said that the UK will try and tear up an EU arms embargo next month so that weapons can be supplied to Syrian rebels and said that both Britain and France want to be able to 'take urgent action' should future atrocities take place.

The UK will send 34 vehicles, including five armoured 4x4s and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad.

The Obama administration opposes directly arming Syrian opposition fighters, in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists.

Sarin
 is a more sophisticated successor to Zyklon B which was used by the 
Nazis in the extermination of millions of Jews in Hitler's death camps.

It is like some farm pesticides but does not occur naturally and cannot occur naturally.

Saddam Hussein used it in the late 80s against Kurdish rebels and it was behind the death of the entire population of Halabja.

United Nations agents destroy chemical weapons stockpiled by Saddam Hussein in 1998

It is so toxic that a drop the 
size of a pin prick is enough to kill and it is heavier than air so it 
hovers close to the ground maximising casualties.

Fumes
 from the colourless, odourless liquid last longer the warmer the 
environment so the constant 25°C on Tokyo's subway provided the perfect 
condition.

Sarin 
attacks the vegal nervous system and victims die within minutes either 
through respiratory failure or a heart attack as they choke on their own
 mucus or saliva.
