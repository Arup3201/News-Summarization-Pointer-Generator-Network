For six years a fleet of ten  Boeing 787 Dreamliners have been sitting unused and unwanted at a Boeing factory in Everett, Washington.

Now there may be hope for them as two buyers have come forward keen to buy the cut price jets.

The abandoned and half-completed aircraft have been labelled the ‘terrible teens’ after being relegated during the early stages of production after numerous structural and weight issues.

According to Bloomberg, the planes have dropped in price to an estimated combined $1billion, which is about half the price of the final, lightweight 787 planes. 

Problems arose after Boeing fast-tracked production before the Dreamliner was certified airworthy. As a result the teens, which were among the earliest designs to be built, were  made too heavy to  fly as far as manufacturers had hoped. 

Although Boeing has never divulged the weight difference for the teens compared to catalogue models, once they are finished their range is estimated to be 6,850km, 1,850km less than later 787-8 Dreamliner models.

But their rock bottom price tag  is finally attracting buyers, with Air Austral and Ethiopian Airlines said to be  in talks to buy the lot in attempts to cut costs amid soaring fuel prices.

Two of the jets have been ordered by Air Austral, a French airline with its headquarters at Roland Garros Airport in Sainte-Marie on the island of Réunion.

Eight more of the heavy Dreamliners look set to go to Ethiopian Airlines which is said to be in 'advanced discussions' to buy them.

Ethiopian Airlines is currently weighing up the addition of many different jets to its fleet

AllAfrica.com reports the African airline is currently weighing up the addition of many different jets to its fleet including the latest version of the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A350.

The Boeing 787 ran more than three years behind schedule for problems with carbon-fibre, on-board systems and manufacturing processes to be ironed out. 

It finally launched to great fanfare in 2011, three years after the so-called jetlag-busting was supposed to go into service.

Airlines that use the jet, which is lightweight, making it more fuel-efficient for long-haul flights, include British Airways, Thomson, United, Etihad and All Nippon.
