A Delaware prison guard has been charged with having sexual relations with three inmates according to state police.

The incident came to the attention of state detectives Tuesday after they were contacted by the Sussex Department of Correction, who reported that a 19-year-old female inmate at the Sussex Correctional Institution Boot Camp Program had had sex with Christopher S. Peck.

Peck was a correctional officer assigned to the Georgetown facility.
