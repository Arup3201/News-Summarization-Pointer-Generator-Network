Cameras set up to film the nocturnal behaviour of urban foxes instead captured a suspected burglar intruding in someone's garden.

Former BBC Springwatch presenter Simon King installed the remote webcam in the garden of a home in Herne Hill, south London, to monitor the behaviour of urban foxes.

But as well as filming the animal's movement, police said the camera 'captured footage of a man climbing over a fence and making off across the garden' after a burglary at a neighbouring property.

He was was filmed in the garden at about 3.45am on Sunday, January 12, after a burglary at the residential address, Scotland Yard said.

The neighbour noticed the camera had been activated overnight and handed the footage to police, a Metropolitan police spokesman said.

Mr King said: 'I understand that a neighbour of our urban fox family residence was burgled and our cameras captured the possible suspect red-handed.

'Anyone can view our network of webcams live through our website at simonkingwildlife.com and they will often see animals doing the strangest of things - but this is taking it one stage further.

'I hope the police are able to make use of the images and that this matter is resolved with as little disruption as possible for all concerned.'
