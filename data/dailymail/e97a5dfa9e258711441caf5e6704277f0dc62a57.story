England's female swimmers made it another golden night in the pool with Fran Halsall winning her second gold and Siobhan O’Connor topping the podium after winning three silvers and a bronze earlier in the week.    

Halsall, 24, has promised greatness for a long time now and is delivering in Glasgow in sensational style. It took her just 25.20sec to make history last night in a watery blur of brilliance. She led the race throughout, becoming the only woman to win Commonwealth gold in both the 50 metres butterfly and 50m freestyle. 

‘It feels just amazing,’ she said. ‘I wanted to swim a bit faster but it’s another personal best so I can’t complain. I was in control the whole race and couldn’t feel anyone’s presence too close.’Less than two hours before, she advanced to her fourth final of the week, this time for tonight’s 100m freestyle, touching on 54.88 to  qualify fifth fastest.

Winner, at last: Siobhan O'Connor has a gold medal to add to her three silvers and one bronze

Finally: O'Connor was able to pose with the gold medal after her brilliant 200m medley final performance

Ahead of the pack: No other swimmers are even in sight as O'Connor heads for the finish

Seemingly 
everything Halsall does is with maximum gusto. That extends to singing 
the national anthem, which she did at full  volume as God Save The Queen
 reverberated round the Tollcross Swimming Centre in her honour. 

Halsall
 frolicked and flirted her way around the edge of the pool as she did a 
lap of honour with her gold medal. As well as being one of England’s 
most talented swimmers she is a natural entertainer out of the pool.

Halsall
 has a breezy manner but things have not always gone her way. In Delhi 
four years ago she had to settle for one gold and had to be fished out 
of the pool after being struck down by a stomach bug.

In London in 2012 she came away empty handed from five medal races.

‘I’ve
 had to grow up,’ she said. ‘The knocks and blows have forced me to. 
When things are going well you don’t have to. I know I have the 
capabilities.’

Halsall
 claims much of her improved form is down to the  rapport she has with 
coach and former Olympian James Gibson, who she appointed after London.

‘It’s
 really good the fact that James swam, he understands me,’ she said. 
‘He’s gone through it himself, went through the Olympics that I went 
through and I have total faith in him and what he asks me to do.’

Easy does it: Fran Halsall won her second gold in the 50m butterfly final on Sunday at the Tollcross centre

On top of the world: Halsall is the first woman to do the sprint double in the pool after a brilliant showing

O’Connor,
 18, is a more understated personality but similarly earmarked for 
greatness. She was only 12 when her idol Rebecca Adlington became a 
double Olympic champion. Six years on her hero was commentating on BBC 
as O’Connor won Commonwealth gold in the 200m medley.

‘She
 is my role model. I can’t put into words how much her support means to 
me. It’s incredible having someone there who has been through it all. 
For her to really believe in me means so much.’

O’Connor
 powered off the blocks and led throughout. She was half a body length 
clear after 50m but Australian Alicia Coutts closed in on her and the 
two were almost level at halfway. Unfazed by the Olympic silver 
medallist on her shoulder, O’Connor motored away to take gold in 2 min 
8.21sec, breaking the Commonwealth Games record by more than 1.5sec. 
Home favourite Hannah Miley clinched bronze behind Coutts in 2:10.74.

O’Connor
 said her victory made it a ‘dream’ Games. ‘I wasn’t sure I had it in 
me,’ she said. ‘But I’m over the moon so that was a dream. My coach said
 to me yesterday I was one race away from making it a better week than I
 could have imagined.’

Leader: O'Connor was at the front from the start but pulled even further ahead to finish two seconds clear

Based
 in her hometown of Bath at one of Britain’s two elite performance 
centres, O’Connor has flourished under the guidance of her coach David 
McNulty. 

‘Dave’s
 coached me since I was 14,’ she said. ‘He’s perfect for me. We’ve been 
through so much, ups and downs, he’s not just a coach but a friend. This
 is an amazing moment and I’ll get to go and  celebrate with him.’

At
 16, O’Connor was the youngest member of the British team which failed 
to perform in London. Like Adlington, who won two bronzes, she was 
excused from blame after finishing 21st in the 100m breaststroke.  

But
 she said the mood among the team in Glasgow is much different. ‘We are 
all chuffed to bits because collectively, not just as England but as 
Britain with the Welsh and Scottish results, we have been doing 
amazingly,’ she said. ‘In the England team there is such a good vibe and
 I’m proud to be part of it.’ 

As
 a reminder of her youth, O’Connor said she would celebrate with ‘lots 
of sweeties,’ but not yet — she has a chance to win a sixth medal in the
 4x100m relay medley.

There was more good news for England as Liam Tancock won bronze in the 50m backstroke in 24.98.
