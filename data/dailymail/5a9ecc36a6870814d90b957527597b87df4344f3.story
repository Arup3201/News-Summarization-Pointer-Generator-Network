Housekeeper, Cresentia Ragonton is accused of stealing a £100,000 painting from Italian financier Giuseppe Ciardi to pay off her debts

A housekeeper stole a £100,000 painting from an Italian financier so she could clear her debts and renovate her 'cold' house, a court heard today.

Cresentla Ragonton, 58, took the ‘Study for Light’ by Ed Ruscha from the Belgravia home of Giuseppe Ciardi in central London.

She tried to sell the artwork at top auction house Bonhams, with an estimated price of £80,000 to £100,000, but police intercepted the sale before it could take place.

Westminster Magistrates Court heard Ragonton needed cash to clear her debts and also hoped to refit of her own home.

‘She removed the painting which was valued at the amount mentioned, and put the painting to be auctioned at Bonhams’, said prosecutor Guy Saul.

‘When she was arrested, she claimed to have debts of £15,000 and also said she wanted to renovate her house because it was very cold.’

Ragonton worked as Mr Ciardi’s housekeeper at his home in Chester Square, Belgravia, for six years, and would often look after his children, the court heard.

Mr Ciardi, 59, who made his fortune as the founder of hedge fund Park Place Capital, bought the art work in New York in 2004 for $65,000.

Before founding Park Place in 1992, he was a Partner in BNP’s Investment Group and Lazard Brothers’ Capital Markets Group – Global Equities.

He began his career at Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York in 1980.

His wife Alexandra was tragically killed in 2005 when she was hit by a speed boat while on holiday in Sardinia.

She was swimming to join her husband on a boat at Calle de Volpe, near to the 'millionaires' playground' of Porto Cervo.

Their three children all witnessed the tragedy.

The accident happened just two days after the Prince and Princess Michael of Kent's £30 million, 246 ft yacht crashed into rocks off Porto Cervo, leaving three people seriously injured in hospital.

Ragonton admitted stealing the painting on August 6 this year.

District
Judge Michael Fanning told her: ‘This was a significant breach of 
trust, you have stolen from your employer who clearly believe he could 
have left you in charge of his premises.

‘You abused that trust, and had you got away with it he would have been significantly out of pocket.’

He said Ragonton would be given credit for the guilty plea and transferred her case to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing.

Ragonton’s barrister, Temi Johnson, said she had been in the UK for several years, and lived with her children who are in their 20s at her home in Canning Town, east London.

‘She has been here for a number of years, and worked for Mr Ciardi for six years’, she said.

‘She has no previous convictions, has never been arrested, and it appears this was a one-off incident.’

Ms Johnson added there was ‘no actual loss’, because the painting was recovered before it could be auctioned off.

Ragonton, dressed in a purple checked jacket with her hair tied back, spoke during the brief hearing to confirm her name, age and address.

She was released on condition bail to sleep every night at her home address and not to apply for a passport or travel documents.

Ragonton, of Sheppard Street, Canning Town, east London, admitted one count of theft.

She will be sentenced on a date yet to be set.
