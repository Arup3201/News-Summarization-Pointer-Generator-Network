The storm around President Hollande's private life does not seem to be calming, as his former partner wins a lawsuit against a gossip magazine as his new girlfriend launches one against the same publication.

Valerie Trierweiler, 48, won 12,000 euros (£9,800) from magazine Closer after they ran pictures of her on holiday in Mauritius in February.

This is despite Ms Trierweiler being a journalist with Closer’s rival, Paris Match, which is well known for publishing beach shots of public figures.

The money awarded to Ms Trierweiler by a court in Nanterre, suburban Paris, was less than a quarter of the 50,000 euros she had demanded.

'The hurt caused is all the greater because the article capitalised on the difficult period that (Miss Trierweiler) was going through,' the court ruling said.

'The number of photographs taken, obviously with a telephoto lens, suggest she was subject to intrusive surveillance by a photographer.'

At the same time, the woman who is said to be Hollande's new girlfriend - and his mistress while he was with Ms Trierweiler is bringing an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against Closer.

It was Closer that reported she was having an affair with President Hollande, and took pictures of the pair's secret rendezvous in Paris last year.

Julie Gayet is seeking 54,000 euros (£44,500) in damages and legal fees from the celebrity gossip glossy, plus front-page publication of a summary of any judicial ruling in the case.

The 41-year-old French actress was not present at proceedings on Thursday, held at the same court in Nanterre.

Closer's January revelation that Hollande was meeting secretly with Gayet led to his public separation from his long-time companion, Ms Trierweiler, and drew international headlines.

Hollande never denied his relationship with Gayet, who has appeared in public only once since the report - at last week's Cesar cinema awards.

Laurence Pieau, the editor of Closer, has defended the publication of the photos of Gayet and Persident Hollande saying it was something the public had a right to know.
