A Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen called Jilly was tonight crowned Best in Show at Crufts.

Jilly, owned by Sara and Gavin Robertson from Wallingford in Oxfordshire, beat more than 20,000 dogs over the four-day competition to take the coveted title.

The canine was one of seven dogs competing in the arena for Best in Show at the NEC in Birmingham tonight, each having been awarded Best of Breed and then Best in Group in previous rounds.

Jilly, aged four, was awarded the first place rosette after being assessed by a Kennel-club approved judge.

Mr Robertson said he had been attending the dog show since he was young and had always wanted to win the prestigious prize.

As photographers snapped the pair on the podium after they were presented with the all important trophy, Mr Robertson took a call from his wife Sara and their two children Oliver, six and Erin, three, congratulating the pair on their win.

Four-year-old Jilly won the Best Hound category then went on to be pronounced Best in Show after four days of competition.

'I'm completely floating on air. It's just a wonderful, wonderful feeling.

'I didn't think I'd actually ever be sat next to this trophy so yes fantastic,' Mr Robertson said.

'I can't express it. I've thought about this since I was a little boy. I've come to this show since I was a little boy and every year I've watched and thought I'd love to be in that place and that position. To finally be here, well, it doesn't feel real.'

He said he had decided months before the competition to retire Jilly after Crufts.

'I just wanted her to enjoy the whole occasion. It's her last show.

'I'd already decided months ago that I would retire her no matter what she got so it's fantastic, you couldn't ask for a script like that. What a way to stop.'

He said the dog usually had ants in her pants and didn't like to stand for any length of time but tonight her performance was fantastic.

'She has a tendency to fidget but she was relaxed and chilled out and I couldn't have asked for a better performance.'

Describing
her at home, Mr Robertson said: 'She's a fun dog, happy, a very active 
and busy little dog, they're like that as a breed so she's always on the
go.'

But it isn't the end 
of an era just yet for Jilly as Mr Robertson is hoping to breed her 
later this year and hinted at the possibility of those being showed at 
Crufts in the future. 

Seven-year-old Owen Howkins who has a rare genetic disorder gained confidence when he met his pet dog Haatchi, who won the Friend for Life award

'She's going to have a happy 
retirement. We're going to hope to have puppies from her this year and 
then she can relax and chill out.

'Breeders always want to breed a great one so we shall see what the future holds.'

Best in Show went to Romeo, a three-year-old Labrador Retriever, winner
of the Gundog category. He had travelled from Cesara in Italy with 
owner Franco Barberi.

Also 
in the final were: Lampard, a Skye Terrier who won the Terrier group; 
Tibetan Terrier Gabby, who took first place in the Utility group; King 
Charles Spaniel Theo, who won the Toy group; Bernese Mountain Dog 
Breeze, who won the working dog group and Australian Shepherd Tiffany 
who won the pastoral group.

The
judges watched the dogs take their lap of honour and marked them for 
their overall health and condition, coat, character, temperament, 
movement and how close they matched up to the Kennel Club Breed 
Standard.

In the Friends for Life category a three-legged stray dog which has helped to turn around the life of a 
seven-year-old boy with a rare genetic disease won first prize.

Haatchi, an Anatolian Shepherd dog, lost a leg after being deliberately tied to a railway line and struck by a train.

The dog  from Basingstoke, Hampshire, had to have a its left hind leg and tail amputated because they were severely damaged leg after the ordeal.

Just one month after his near death experience he joined the family of Owen Howkins.

Owen has a rare genetic condition called Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, which causes his muscles to be permanently tense.
