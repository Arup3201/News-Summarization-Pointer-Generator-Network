The daughter of Barclays boss Bob Diamond, who sprung to his defence on Tuesday, is an Ivy League grad once listed among Wall Street's 'hottest offspring.'

Nell Diamond, who turns 24 this month, has come out swinging in support of her embattled father, launching an abbreviated but vulgar taunt against UK politicians as her father becomes the centre of an international investigation into the Libor interest rate-fixing scandal.

The raven-haired beauty and Princeton graduate took to Twitter to vent some rage over her father’s ouster, posting: 'George Osborne and Ed Miliband you can go ahead and #HMD'.

The bizarre insult is defined by the Urban Dictionary as an acronym for 'hold my d***.'

Nell and her father are known to be very close, as the two are often photographed together at various events in the last several years.

In November 2011, she tweeted a picture of her and her father together at a Jay-Z concert making his famous 'diamond' hand gesture - a symbol for his Roc-A-Fella Records company.

In 2010, she was listed among Business Insider's list of Wall Street’s hottest offspring - a grouping of the 1 per cent’s fresh-faced sons and daughters.

That same year, in an interview with Washington University’s Student Life newspaper, she described Princeton as ‘definitely very, very stressful, mostly because of the level of independent work.'

She also scribed a piece in a Princeton fashion magazine, in which she reportedly wrote:  ‘Certainly in these trying economic times, it seems not only unethical but impossible for so many people to shell out $700 for a single pair of shoes.’

She is briefly mentioned in the book Too Big to Fail as a support system for her father, who rushed to New York along with her mother to be with him at the height of Wall Street's tumult.

In spite of the stresses, Nell, who was president of the Pi Phi sorority, graduated last year with a degree in English after completing her thesis on ‘the Cultural Myth of Female Hair in the Victorian Imagination.’

All a Twitter: Within minutes the offensive tweet was taken down, but not before it was retweeted by Times journalist David Rose

Shortly after graduation, she began working as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, and stays active in charities like UNICEF.

Her tweet against Osbourne and Miliband was removed minutes after it was posted, perhaps in light of the fact that the beleaguered Barclays chief is scheduled to face a grilling from the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday over the rate-fixing scheme.

It was replaced with another post, which read: ‘No one in the world I admire more than my dad. 16yrs building Barclays. Shame to see the mistakes of few tarnish the hard work of so many.’

Once translated in the Twitterverse, her 'HMD' remark continued to provoke confusion.

One puzzled Twitter follower wrote: 'So apparently this is what #HMD means but I'm not any clearer as to what it means in this context. #confusedbytxtspk'.

The controversy came after Bob Diamond fell on his sword amid intense pressure from on the bank to force him out, it was claimed.

Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn 
King phoned chairman Marcus Agius to say he wanted the American 
financier out, it was claimed.

It was reported today that Mr Diamond 
decided to resign on Monday night after assessing the reaction to Mr 
Agius' decision to quit.

But despite his resignation, Mr Diamond, 60, shocked the City by defiantly insisting that he would stay on at the bank despite the rate-fixing scandal.

The details of Mr Diamond’s testimony 
before Parliament  could be highly embarrassing for regulators with 
increasing speculation that they were aware of the bank’s practices but 
failed to act.

His resignation will leave him free to speak openly about what went on at the bank.

Mr Diamond is said to be furious that 
he and the bank have been blamed for 'lowballing' the rates at which 
Barclays said it could borrow from rivals.

Bankers insist the authorities knew these rates were inaccurate but did not act because they feared the truth would destabilise the markets.

It is also claimed that regulators possessed evidence of rate-fixing.

Mr Diamond, who joined the 
bank 16 years ago, said in his resignation statement today: 'I am deeply
disappointed that the impression created by the events announced last 
week about what Barclays and its people stand for could not be further 
from the truth.'

'My motivation has always been to do what I 
believed to be in the best interests of Barclays. No decision over that 
period was as hard as the one that I make now to stand down as chief 
executive.'

He went on: 'I know that each and 
every one of the people at Barclays works hard every day to serve our 
customers and clients. That is how we support economic growth and the 
communities in which we live and work.'

He
added: 'I leave behind an extraordinarily talented management team that
I know is well placed to help the business emerge from this difficult 
period as one of the leaders in the global banking industry.'

George Osborne said Mr 
Diamond's resignation was 'the right decision for Barclays' and the 
'right decision for the country'.
