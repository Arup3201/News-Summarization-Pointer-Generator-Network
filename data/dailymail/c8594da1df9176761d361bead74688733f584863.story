Asso Salhi was jailed for six years for rape at Maidstone Crown Court after attacking the teenage girl at a friends house in March 2013 

A man who raped a teenage girl while she slept following a night out has been jailed for six years. 

Asso Salhi, 25, attacked the girl while they were both staying overnight at a friend's house on March 1, 2013. 

The victim said she had been drunk 'but aware' after going to nightclubs in the centre of Gravesend, Kent.  

She arrived at her friend's house in the early hours, took off her boots and went to sleep on top of a duvet with Salhi next to her.

But despite others being in the house she woke up to Salhi raping her, and afterwards ran out of the property to alert a friend who called police.

Officers arrived and arrested him at the scene. Shalhi claimed that his victim had initiated the sex, although the jury found him guilty of rape.  

Recorder Anesta Weekes QC jailed Salhi, of Gravesend, Kent, for six years at Maidstone Crown Court.

He told Salhi, who did not go into the witness box to give evidence, that his name would appear on the sex offenders' register.

DC Victoria Martlew of Kent Police, said: 'Salhi has denied raping this young woman from the very beginning, blaming her and insisting she had come on to him.

'He took advantage of his victim when she was asleep and at her most vulnerable and has shown absolutely no remorse for the tremendous ordeal he put her through.'

Questioned by Charlotte Newell, defending, the teenager said she ran out 'as fast as I could'.

She said: 'I would not dream of thinking he wanted to have sex with me. I was drunk. I just wanted to go to sleep. I crashed out.

'I have never had sex with anyone other than I have been in a relationship with. I would never have sex with somebody I hardly knew.

'I didn't call out while I was being raped because I was scared.

'As soon as I got out of bed I was looking around for my phone. I was saying to the others to wake up. I was scared. I was shocked.

'He didn't try to stop me leaving. He stayed in bed and didn't say anything. I ran out as fast as I could.'
