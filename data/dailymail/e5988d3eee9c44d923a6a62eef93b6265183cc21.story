As one of the most celebrated children’s books, The Tale Of Peter Rabbit has provided inspiration for everything from crockery to a BBC animation series.

And now Beatrix Potter’s story of a naughty rabbit who sneaks into Mr McGregor’s garden to steal his vegetables is to be honoured once again – at this year’s Chelsea Flower Show in May.

The Peter Rabbit herb garden will treat fans of the much-loved work to a botanical re-creation of the book’s most famous scenes.

Among them will be a rabbit-size model of Peter eating what appears to be a carrot but will actually be a Victorian variety of radish known as ‘Long Scarlet’.

The garden is being put together by Richard Lucas, a previous gold medal winner at Chelsea.

He said: ‘I want this to feel like we’ve stepped into a Beatrix Potter tale. I hope I can put a smile on people’s faces.

‘There was a little artistic licence but most of the plants have appeared in the books.’
