The world's tallest Ferris wheel is under construction in Las Vegas which will tower more than 100 feet over the London Eye.

The High Roller is expected to be open to thrill-seekers with a head for heights next year and it is already beginning to take shape.

Towering high over many of the big hotel complexes around it, the wheel, when completed will stand at 550 feet. The London Eye, which commands spectacular views over the English capital, is 443 feet tall.

World record: The Las Vegas High Roller will be the tallest Ferris wheel in the world when it opens next year

Currently Singapore's Flyer holds the record for the highest Ferris wheel, but when it opens, High Roller will stand 9 feet taller, according to the Las Vegas Times.

Similar to London Eye, the High roller will have numerous cabins from which visitors can slowly watch the city unfold beneath them during a 30minute ride, making one revolution.

Each pod will be able to hold up to 40 guests, the news service said and tickets are expected to be around $30 to $35 - comparable to London's ride which charges around £19 for adults and £10 for children.

Parts of the retail and entertainment complex will be open in time for the busy winter shopping season, as per the plans.

Restaurants and shops will open their doors in time for festive visitors and New Years Eve revellers attending the 300,000 square foot mall.

But the giant Ferris wheel is not scheduled to be operating until early 2014, after safety checks have been completed.

Speaking to the LA Times, Jon Gray, the Linq’s general manager, said: 'This is Vegas and we intend to do Vegas right. This will be a very entertaining experience from start to finish.
