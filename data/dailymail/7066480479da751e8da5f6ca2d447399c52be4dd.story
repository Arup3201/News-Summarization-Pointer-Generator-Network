A mother-of-three says she has no choice but to claim benefits because she can't hold down a job and be a parent.

Claire Fitzpatrick, 29, from Jaywick, Essex, who gets £2,400 in welfare payments, says she has no alternative but to rely on the handouts.

'I didn't choose to be on benefits, I had no choice because I had children,' she said on Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain: Life On the Dole.

Mother-of-three Claire, pictured holding her youngest child Louis on TV show Benefits Britain, says it’s not worth her time to work as she can get more money by claiming benefits

Defending her position, she added: 'I am a mum, why should you be put down for being a mum and wanting to live your life with your children?'

Ms Fitzpatrick and her family get nearly £29,000 a year in income support, child tax credit, child benefit and Disability Living Allowance - which they qualify for as her eldest son, Ronnie, seven, is autistic.

She said she had been on benefits her whole life and has found it more lucrative than getting a job.

'I used to earn £1,000 a month but I get that on benefits so what's the point of working?' she said.

Her fiance, Luke, is currently unemployed as he's struggled to find work after serving a jail term for theft.

Ms Fitzpatrick has two children from a previous relationship, Ronnie, and Kaya, five, and a baby called Louis with Luke, 22.

They all live in a two-bedroom bungalow on the Brooklands estate alongside a host of animals including two dogs, three snakes and two guinea pigs.

Ms Fitzpatrick said they are often criticised for keeping so many pets who they have to feed out of their benefits budget.

'People say "you are on benefits, you shouldn't have so many pets" but we were bought them cheap as presents and the children cost more to feed,' she said.

The mother-of-three says their money goes much further now they live in Jaywick as opposed to London - where Luke had to steal in order to get by. 

The new series of Benefits Britain, which starts on Channel 5 this evening, is set in the Essex village by the sea which is home to 5,000 people. Sixty per cent of the working age population there is on benefits.

It is one of the poorest areas in the country with unemployment double the national average.

The new series of Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole begins on Channel 5 this evening at 9pm
