Adult ants are able to identify potential rivals before they emerge from their pupae, a study has revealed.

Constant patrolling of the nest 
ensures that a male Cardiocondyla obscurior ant is able to bite or chemically tag a rival as soon 
as he is born.

Chemically tagged ants are then quickly 
destroyed by workers in 'death squads', according to researchers from University of Regensburg and IST Austria.

When ants emerge from their pupae - or eclosion - they are vulnerable to attack because their exoskeleton has 
not yet hardened to protect them and their mandibles are also too weak 
to bite an attacker.

And a rival is easy to spot because male  Cardiocondyla obscurior ants are diphenic, either winged or wingless.

The dominant wingless male ant, therefore, keeps an eye out for newborn winged ants.

The researchers investigated the behaviour of male ergatoid 
C. obscurior ants in response to newly pupated males and females, as well
as their interaction with developing pupae.

It would be advantageous for newly emerged males to hide from attackers.

However,
while winged males use chemical female mimicry to avoid being detected,
young wingless males are easily detected and attacked by older males.

If
the fight occurs during the first day after eclosion the older male 
will always win, but once the younger male's exoskeleton hardens his 
chances of surviving rises to 14 per cent.

Nearly 50 per cent of fights 
between older and two-day old males results in the death of both 
combatants.

In addition to biting, the males also smeared each other with secretions from their anuses which encouraged worker aggression.

The
older males were more likely to chemically tag two-day-olds than 
younger rivals - presumably recognising that they needed help to win the 
fight.

However, since both males end up being tagged they both suffer 
worker attacks.

The winners
of these fights smear more and are attacked less by workers. So 
although this tactic overall may provide an 'edge' it is a risky 
strategy.

Lead researcher Dr Sylvia Cremer,
from IST Austria, said: 'Older ergatoid male 
ants are able to distinguish pupae containing females by their chemical 
scent from those containing males.

'Pupae
containing males are often bitten while those containing females, or 
winged males disguised as females, elicit a mating response.

'However,
the chances of mistakenly killing a female or worker possibly prevents 
older males from attempting to completely destroy all rival males before
they emerge from their pupae.'

C.
obscurior ants produce sexual females and ergatoid males throughout the
year.

In terms of colony survival this ensures that if the old dominant
male dies there is a new male ready to replace him.

The study is published in BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Ecology.
