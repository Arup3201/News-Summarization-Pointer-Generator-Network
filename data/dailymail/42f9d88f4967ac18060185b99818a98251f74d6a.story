A jealous lover who tortured a love rival to death with a hot poker for sleeping with his girlfriend while he was in prison has been jailed for at least 30 years.

Gary Speight, 31, beat Anthony Bates with a broom handle, stabbed him in the neck with an apple skewer and poured molten syrup over his head.

In what senior prosecutors described as one of the most chilling cases they have heard, Mr Bates was branded with the poker as Blondie’s ‘One Way or Another’ played in the background.

He was also stamped on until his skull fractured and had his kneecaps broken.

Audio from the horrific attack was 
taped on an iPhone by a workman standing outside the flat, and Mr Bates can
be heard groaning as he is told: ‘Get up or you are going to die.’

By that stage Mr Bates was so brain damaged he was unable to stand.

Speight later bragged to friends that he planned to chop up the body and throw the pieces in the Thames.

His victim’s mutilated body was 
discovered by police in the blood-spattered kitchen of a flat in 
Vauxhall, South London, in the early hours of February 1.

Speight was convicted of murder by a unanimous verdict following a five-week trial at the Old Bailey.

Accomplice Dean Swift, 44, was 
convicted by a majority of 10 to two. He was also jailed for life and 
given a minimum term of 28 years.

Judge Charles Byers said: ‘It was a brutal and 
callous murder, carried out over the long period of a day.

‘I am sure that Anthony Bates died in exquisite pain and I am quite satisfied that you tortured him with a sadistic pleasure.

‘You tried to stick a hot poker up him, and although you failed you still branded him.

‘There was a clear element of sadism, and use of multiple weapons, as he was beaten, punched, kicked, and assaulted him.

‘You also poured hot syrup, boiled in a kettle to 150 degree over him.

‘You Gary Speight, when in drink are a
reckless and dangerous bully, and that you Dean Swift are a depraved 
human being who remarked to a witness “that you really enjoyed it.”

‘You showed him no compassion, and 
when the thought of calling an ambulance crossed you minds, Gary Speight
you prevented it for your own selfish reasons.

‘You left him on his own in pain, to die. Anyone who heard that tape will be affected by it for years to come.'

Swift’s girlfriend Corina Lowe, 28, earlier broke down in tears as she was cleared of murder.

Jurors heard that Mr Bates, who had 
dated Speight’s girlfriend Laura O’Shaughnessy for up to six months 
before he was killed, was lured to the flat in Vauxhall on January 31.

At 11am that day, Speight texted her: ‘Do you want Tony to live ring me.’

Over the coming hours, Speight was joined by Swift and others as they launched their relentless assault.

A post-mortem report later showed Mr 
Bates had suffered a series of bone fractures including a shattered 
kneecap, and a brain injury.

Some of the attack was recorded on an
iPhone from a communal corridor by workman Lee Farrow, who was removing
asbestos from the building.

In the recording, witness Ozell Buntin can be heard yelling: ‘No Gary, you’re going to kill him.

‘Please don’t hit him no more man, that’s enough... you’re gonna kill him like that, seriously!’

A voice, said to be Speight, can later be heard announcing: ‘He can die there. I’ll chop him up.’

Buntin, who has since died, told 
police that Speight later called him and asked for his help to ‘chop’ up
the body and throw the pieces in the Thames, and told him to bring 
petrol so they could burn down the block of flats.

Officers were eventually led to the flat after William Furlong, one of Speight’s friends, reported the murder to police.
