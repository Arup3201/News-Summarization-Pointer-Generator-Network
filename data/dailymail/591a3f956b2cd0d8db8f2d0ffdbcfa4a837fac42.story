Team news

Aston Villa

Captain Ron Vlaar could return for Aston Villa's FA Cup quarter-final with West Brom as he battles a calf injury.

Alan Hutton is suspended after collecting his 10th booking of the season in the 2-1 Barclays Premier League win over the Baggies on Tuesday.

Ron Vlaar is set to return after missing Aston Villa's last two matches with a calf injuy

Philippe Senderos has suffered a set-back in his recovery from a calf injury and is sidelined while Kieran Richardson, Aly Cissokho, Nathan Baker and Libor Kozak are out.

Provisional squad: Given, Guzan, Lowton, Clark, Vlaar, Okore, Bacuna, Sanchez, Cleverley, Cole, Westwood, Delph, Gil, Sinclair, Grealish, Benteke, Weimann, Agbonlahor.

West Brom

West Brom will be without injured forward Victor Anichebe (groin) and cup-tied midfielder Darren Fletcher for Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at Aston Villa.

Albion boss Tony Pulis has said he has a few 'knocks and niggles' in his squad to assess. Winger Callum McManaman (foot) is a doubt, while frontmen Saido Berahino and Brown Ideye have both been playing recently with pain-killing injections.

Darren Fletcher played in West Brom's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa in the Barclays Premier League on Tuesday but cannot feature in the FA Cup clash as the midfielder is cup tied

Pulis also said the club 'have to go careful' with Stephane Sessegnon, with the forward understood to have suffered a family bereavement, and it remains to be seen whether goalkeeper Ben Foster keeps his place after his costly late error in the 2-1 Barclays Premier League loss at Villa Park on Tuesday.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Wisdom, Lescott, Baird, Dawson, Olsson, McAuley, McManaman, Gamboa, Morrison, Yacob, Mulumbu, Brunt, Gardner, Sessegnon, Berahino, Ideye.

Kick-off: Saturday, 5.30pm - BBC One
