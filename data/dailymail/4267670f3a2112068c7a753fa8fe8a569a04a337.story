If you’ve ever wondered what the world looks like through the eyes of a cat, now’s your chance to find out. 

Developer Chris Chung has created a first-person cat simulator game called Catlateral Damage. 

The aim of the game is to roam around virtual rooms, swiping at objects using the cat's paw and destroying as many household items as possible.

The Catlateral Damage game, pictured, was created by Boston-based developer Chris Chung. It lets players roam around a virtual room, destroying household items with an on-screen paw

Move around the room using the keyboard keys W, for left, A for forward, S for back, and D for right. 

To swipe at objects and knock them over, click the left and right mouse buttons. 

Keep the cat’s paw facing forward by 
holding the middle scrolling button on the mouse, or press the button 
once to swat forward.  

Players can also sprint by holding down the shift key, and jump by pressing Space.

There are two modes of play. Cat Ops mode lets players roam around the virtual house at their leisure. 

Boston-based QA tester Chung came up with the idea for Catlateral Damage in August last year, and is now working on a full version release. It is currently available as an alpha version and can be played on browsers that have the Unity Web Player plug-in installed

The game was designed to give players an idea of what it's like to be a mischievous feline

In Time Attack mode, players are given two minutes to cause as much damage as possible, collecting points for each broken item. 

During Time Attack mode, players can only complete the level by collecting a minimum of 10,000 points.

There are also standalone players for Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems. 

A full version is expected later this year 2014.
