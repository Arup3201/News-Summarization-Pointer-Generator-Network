The Queen rolled out the red carpet for China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang today as part of his three-day official visit to Britain designed to ease diplomatic tensions - and win billions of pounds in business contracts.

Her Majesty welcomed Mr Li and his wife at Windsor Castle alongside Prince Andrew before crunch talks in Number 10 this afternoon.

At the Downing Street meeting, China's 30 year ban on British beef is expected to be lifted. A raft of other business deals will be announced to coincide with the visit, but Mr Cameron is also under pressure to raise concerns about China’s human rights record.

Relations between China and Britain were strained two years ago after Mr Clegg and Prime Minister David Cameron met the Dalai Lama in London.

China has always warned foreign governments from holding talks with the Tibetan spiritual leader, who wants his homeland to enjoy self-rule free from Chinese control.

Mr Li's visit is seen as a breakthrough in Sino-British affairs and key to securing major Chinese investment in the UK.

Mr Cameron wants to secure agreement on the ending the Chinese ban on imports of British beef and lamb. Restrictions were imposed by the Chinese in response to the BSE outbreak in the 1980s.

It is expected that formal official-level talks will begin on opening up a market which could be worth up to £120 million to the British economy.

Mr Cameron and Mr Li will tuck into lunch in Downing Street which will be prepared by Manchester-based catering firm Sweet Mandarin.

In addition to the official functions, Mr Li and his wife Cheng Hong are expected to have what Chinese officials described as 'tete-a-tete interactions' with Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha to 'build up trust and consolidate close working and personal relations'.

The Chinese premier is also due to meet Labour leader Ed Miliband during his visit, although he is not expected to be holding any talks with Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg.

But the highlight of Mr Li's visit was this morning's meeting with the Queen. 

The Chinese leader was greeted with a smile and a handshake by the Queen, who was joined by the Duke of York in the White Drawing Room this morning.

Prince Andrew had been waiting outside to meet Mr Li and his party when they swept into the castle’s quadrangle in a fleet of limousines.

Other deals due to be announced to coincide with the premier's visit include Chinese financial services group Nord Engine making up to £150 million available to invest in UK and European small and medium enterprises.

China Minsheng Investment Corporation will open its European headquarters in London, with around 1.5 billion US dollars (£883 million) of investments in a range of sectors.

Oil giant BP is expected to sign a £5billion deal to supply liquid gas to China while Royal Dutch Shell will form an alliance with Cnooc.

However, the trade deals could be overshadowed by a row over China’s human rights record and Britain’s contact with the Dalai Lama.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg risked causing upset yesterday by accusing Beijing of 'systematic human rights abuses' and claiming he would happily meet the Dalai Lama again.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he was 'honoured' to have talks the Tibetan spiritual leader in 2012, despite the meeting plunging relations with China into the deep freeze.

While Mr Clegg acknowledged the importance of developing commercial ties with China, he said that did not mean human rights would be ignored during Mr Li's visit, despite Beijing's notorious sensitivity on the issue.

'That doesn't mean that we cannot in a respectful but firm way - as we do, as the Prime Minister did when he was in China recently - point out that we remain deeply, deeply concerned about the very large-scale abuse of human rights that still continues,' he said.

'Of course we can’t agree on large scale and systematic human rights abuses which still continue in China to this day.

'The many journalists who are persecuted. The very widespread use of the death penalty.

'This is a country which is going on an extraordinary journey. We’ve seen economic transformation on a scale possibly unheard of in the modern world, with millions of people have become economically emancipated, although they are still politically shackled to a doctrine which is a one party state, a communist state, which is the antithesis of the kind of open, democratic society I believe in.'

Relations between China and Britain were plunged into the deep freeze in 2012 after David Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg met the Dalai Lama

Campaigners have called on Mr Cameron to directing Mr Li over the country's human rights record.

A coalition of human rights organisations urged Mr Cameron to discuss the situation in Tibet and make a public statement calling for the Chinese government to commit to reforms.

Tibet Society chief executive Philippa Carrick said: 'The visit of Premier Li to the UK is being purported to herald a new era of Chinese investment in the UK, however, it could also herald a worrying level of influence by China in the UK.

'David Cameron must be clear that universal values of human and civil rights are integral to any engagement we have with China and Britain's relationship with China cannot be just about trade and economics.'

Shao Jiang, a survivor of the Tiananmen Square massacre and member of Cuts UK said: 'The UK must not be bullied by China. The Chinese government seeks to deflect criticism from its human rights record by threatening withdrawal of trade.'
