In one shot, the 27-year-old shows off her feminine side in a floral print dress and in another, she sports a more androgynous look in tailored white trousers and one of the store's popular new coats.

The collection has been created to support home grown talent as well as celebrate British creativity and the design team had the run of the Marks and Sparks archives, resulting in a modern, wearable take on retro British style featuring herringbone and check prints as well as bold, bright jacquard florals, all showcased to perfection by Rosie. 

The design team have paid attention to details and also the accessories, including classic brogues and rust-coloured saddle bags made, of course, with British leather. 

Rosie has long been a member of the M&S family and also designs a lingerie range for Autograph, which has gone on to become one of the store's best-selling ranges.

Brand Rosie: The actress and model recently spoke of her desire to build a brand from her name and reportedly has a beauty range in the works

The actress and model, who recently spoke of her desire to build a brand from her name, was unveiled as the face of  Moroccanoil earlier this year.

Rosie is the haircare brand's first ever famous face and shows off her glossy, flowing hair in the new campaign imagery.

The advertisements run with the tag line 'Inspired' and the ethos behind the campaign is to celebrate and empower women around the world, and not only in the glossy hair stakes.

A short film series to accompany the campaign will soon be unveiled, which features Rosie revealing her own inspirations, along with powerful stories from five other women.

Rosie recently opened up about her looks in an interview with Industrie magazine explaining why it's important for her to be more than a pretty face.

'I realised early on that nothing lasts forever, especially as a model - you have to build something for yourself from it. Looks go and you fade. Modelling is short-lived,' she said.

'I wanted something for when I want to take a back seat. There'll be a brand that I'll be sitting at the helm of and enjoying. This is really the start of something I see as a long-term thing.' 

The model and actress is also gearing up to star in Mad Max: Fury Road alongside Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz and Tom Hardy and has a rumoured beauty range in the works.
