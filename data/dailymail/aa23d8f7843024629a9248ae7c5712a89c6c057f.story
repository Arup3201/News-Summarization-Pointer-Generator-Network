Megan, pictured with her mother Victoria Nuttall, had been in a relationship with an older man

The angry mother of a 14-year-old girl who was found hanged in her bedroom - after an older man split up with her upon discovering her age - has questioned why police did not prosecute the 24-year-old who had sex with her daughter.

Victoria Nuttall, the 39-year-old mother of tragic Megan Edmunds, claims the man knew her daughter was 13 at the time of their relationship, but does not believe its end was to blame for her death. 

Mrs Nuttall, who now lives in Cradley Heath, West Midlands, said the teenager confided in her about the relationship and admitted she had made a mistake.

'It was not a sexual relationship. It was one time. Megan came and told me what she had done and we took her to the family planning clinic,' she said

'It happened once and she did say she felt stupid. With Megan's frame, you could tell she was 13 so there is no way that he should have got her mistaken for a 16-year-old.

'I am very very angry that the police didn't prosecute him. He knew that she was 13.

'I had a conversation with her and she said she didn't tell him she was 16. And her friend backed her up.

'She only met him because he was selling cannabis to her friend's older brother. I have never come face to face with him.'

Mrs Nuttall, who has another daughter and four sons who are all older than Megan, added that she did not think the relationship was the reason for her death.

'For Megan to do something like this we were all so bewildered. There has never been anything like this in our family,' she said.

'She has got three older brothers and an older sister and me and she always confided in us. We have always been there for her.

'We used to have girly nights with crisps and pop and watch DVDs.

'There was nothing underlying, there was nothing about her say stuff was going wrong or she was fed up of anything.

The 14-year-old schoolgirl  was found hanged in her bedroom,  with notes suggesting people were 'after her'

'Her personality was so bubbly. It was an accident. I think it was a cry for help, maybe she wanted some attention and it went too far.

'We still think about her every day, I cry for her every single day. I know my day will come when I can be with her again and I will be happy.'

Megan had been expelled from school seven months before her death and was at a pupil referral unit.

She said since moving to the unit she had changed a lot and the night before her death had run away to Manchester with another girl from the unit.

Mrs Nuttall said after her death Megan had left notes suggesting that people were 'causing her trouble'.

'Megan was not being bullied. Coming from a family of older brothers and sisters and me being a single-parent mum, she was a strong personality and we were close and tight-knit,' she said.

Detective Inspector Michael Spellman, from West Bromwich police's public protection unit, said the notes found in her bedroom suggested that 'people were after her', but no-one could shed any light on who these people were.

Inquiries revealed that Megan had visited a family planning clinic and confided in staff about the under-age relationship, but had refused to involve police. The man was eventually traced and interviewed, telling police that Megan  told him she was 16.

They started a sexual relationship, but the man, who was 23 at the time, received an anonymous phone call telling him she was 13, so he ended it, the hearing was told.

A West Midlands Police spokesperson said: 'We arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sexual activity with a child on 16 July last year. No further action was taken against him.' 

Black Country Coroner Robin Balmain recorded a narrative conclusion that Megan hanged herself and her motives and intentions were not clear.

Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Nuttall said she thought Megan's death was an accident.
