A Nova Scotia mall has dropped a controversial advertising campaign that appeared to portray young girls as shopping-obsessed airheads after receiving a flood of complaints.

Dartmouth's Mic Mac Mall has agreed to donate $5,000 to an organisation empowering women after their back-to-school campaign was branded sexist and demeaning to women.

One of the controversial advert read 'social studies? Does posing in my new boots on Facebook count?' Another proclaims: 'Mixing patterns — now that’s a science!'.

But the campaign appears to have backfired after it was slammed by parents and intellectuals as offensive and demeaning to women.

The Mall's marketing director said in a news release that the mall was sorry for offending customers.

'We’ve heard what our customers have had to say and we understand why you’re angry. It was never intended to be offensive.

'Because we want to regain your trust and show how much we care for our community and girls’ education, we plan to donate $5,000 to a local organization that focuses on empowering girls.

'We’ll announce the group we choose by early next week. In the meantime, we’d love to hear from our community about which organizations we should consider.'

But Patricia Parsons, communications professor at Mount Saint Vincent University, said she thought it amounted to: ‘A day late and a dollar short'.

She told CBS: 'Unfortunately there probably are young women who probably find this thing kind of funny.

It's one of the things though that I suspect their parents don’t find very funny. And I did note yesterday on Twitter that a father chimed in and said, ‘So this is what they think of our daughters.'

Many people took to Twitter to criticise the ads which were posted on Billboards and appeared on TV, in newspapers and online.

One Dartmouth resident tweeted: 'Your back to school ad campaign is kind of humiliating.'

Another wrote: You would think that ‘girls are dumb but love shopping!!!’ pitch would have gotten questioned at SOME point, but no.'
