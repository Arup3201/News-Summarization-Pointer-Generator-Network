While the horrific human impact of the Gaza conflict cannot be ignored, there is also damage being done in the Middle East's entertainment business.

Israel's TV industry has suffered an estimated loss of £15million since fighting broke out 23 days ago, but broadcasting giant Keshet does not want to interrupt the sixth series of Big Brother Israel.

With the show providing huge ratings for the channel, Keshet has decided to keep it on air and provide a bomb shelter for participants on the site in the village of Neve Ilan, west of Jerusalem.

Running for cover: Producers have installed alarms in the property that alert housemates to head for shelter

Producers have installed alarms in the property that alert housemates to head for shelter - and they have already sounded twice within the first week of use, reported TMZ.

Ran Telem, Keshet’s vice president of programming, said the decision to keep the show - which has a 45 per cent audience share of Israeli households - on air was ‘really debated’ before being made.

He told the Hollywood Reporter: ‘The audience appreciates the break they get, so we try very hard despite the situation to keep it on the air.

'The contract we have with the viewers at home is that when there is a significant development, we return to the news telecast at once.’

But critics claim Keshet has only made the decision for profit at a time of crisis during the conflict, which has already claimed the lives of nearly 1,400 people, mostly civilians.

The conflict has already forced US productions such as FX's Tyrant and USA Network's Dig to move to Turkey and Malta respectively.

Meanwhile, broadcasters in Israel are losing huge amounts of money partly because news programmes are now dominating TV schedules.

It has been claimed that losses from the first two weeks of fighting stand at £7.8million for Keshet, and £6.5million for another of Israel’s leading media firms, Reshet.

Reshet vice-president Yael Gaoni told the Israel Hayom newspaper that the conflict was having an ‘immediate effect’ on the commercial television market in Israel.
