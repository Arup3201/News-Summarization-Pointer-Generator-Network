Sportsmail analyses what we learned from the latest round of fixtures in the Premier League as we head into the new year.

1. Cesc Fabregas has topped the charts for making chances and completing passes, but there’s one more stat he should be less proud of.

The former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder’s poor challenge on Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen near the end of Chelsea’s 5-3 defeat at White Hart Lane was his eighth yellow card of the season.

One of those – wrongly given for diving when he was fouled against Southampton – might have been bad luck but the rest of them suggest that Fabregas needs to tidy up his tackling.

2. Alex Bruce’s return from a hamstring injury has made a major contribution to helping dad Steve out of the crisis developing at Hull.

The Tigers now have two wins in four games since the 30-year-old central defender, fighting to win a new contract at the KC Stadium when his current deal runs out at the end of the season, returned to the starting line-up. Against Everton he was Hull’s best defender, making 13 clearances and finding a team-mate with 100 per cent of his passes.

3. Stephane Sessegnon was anxious to impress new West Brom boss Tony Pulis as he watched at Upton Park before taking over.

The former Sunderland man, dragged off with nearly half an hour left of Sunday’s 2-0 defeat at Stoke, made Albion’s goal in the 1-1 draw for Saido Berahino and created four other chances as well as having four shots of his own. It meant he was involved in nine of his side’s 14 attempts on goal.

4. Eliaquim Mangala is slowly settling into Manchester City’s defence after a torrid start to his Premier League career following his £32million transfer from Porto.

The 23-year-old French international has now played seven games in a row while skipper Vincent Kompany has been missing.

Against Sunderland he was the most effective defender, with his 10 clearances as many as the rest of City’s back four put together.

5. Joe Cole’s season at Aston Villa is turning into a flop – despite the absence of both Fabian Delph and Kieran Richardson through suspension the 33-year-old was still only on the bench for the 0-0 draw with Palace.

Cole did get on for the final eight minutes but got no more than five touches of the ball in that time.

6. George Boyd continues to be the Premier League’s running man – the Burnley midfielder smashed his own record for the greatest distance covered in a top-flight game this season by hitting 8.4 miles at Manchester City.

The 29-year-old, who went further than anybody else on both Boxing Day and December 28 with 8.1 miles each time, still had enough energy left to score the late equaliser that snatched a crucial point for Sean Dyche’s side at Newcastle.

7. Leicester will miss the pace in wide positions of Jeff Schlupp when the 22-year-old is away playing for Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations.

Schlupp, born in Germany but brought up in England by Ghanaian parents, scored in the 2-2 draw at Anfield and Liverpool were constantly troubled by the running of both him and Jamie Vardy.

Vardy recorded a top speed of 21.7mph – quicker than the best of 21.5mph registered by Raheem Sterling. Schlupp was Leicester’s second fastest at 20.8mph.

8. Robin van Persie is having a difficult time in Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United system, as the map showing he had only 17 touches of the ball in the 1-1 draw at Stoke proved.

But the Dutch World Cup star is certainly trying to get involved. He made 67 sprints during the game, the most by any United player at the Britannia Stadium.

9. Dusan Tadic was Ronald Koeman’s first signing after taking over Southampton and the £10.9million midfielder is emerging as one of the best.

The 26-year-old Serbia international scored one of the goals that beat Arsenal and set up three other chances as Saints moved back into fourth place.

Only Steven Davis made more successful passes than his 20 in Arsenal’s half – and for good measure Tadic also made more tackles than any other player on the pitch.

Dusan Tadic was Ronald Koeman's first signing as Southampton manager and he may well be the best

10. France international Bafetimbi Gomis has struggled at Swansea since his summer free transfer move from Lyon, with only one goal from 16 appearances, even if all but four of them have been as a sub.

He had 10 attempts in all at Queens Park Rangers (with only two of them on target) before Wilfried Bony then came on to grab an equaliser for Garry Monk’s team.

At 29 and with 12 international caps behind him, Gomis should have known better than to be caught offside three times. Only West Ham’s Diafro Sakho (five) was flagged up more during the New Year’s Day games.

Bafetimbi Gomis hasn't had as big an impact as expected at Swansea with just one Premier League goal
