Sentenced: Ross Jameson was jailed for six months

A drunken yob who forced a plane to make an emergency landing after becoming embroiled in a mid-air scrap has been jailed.

Ross Jameson's actions led the packed holiday jet to make an emergency landing soon after taking off from Newcastle Airport to fly to Alicante in Spain.

The Easyjet flight was diverted to London, Gatwick where Jameson, 23, and his girlfriend Jordan Summersgilll were both arrested.

Witnesses reported that Jameson had a 'furious row' with Summergill soon after take-off.

The incident caused major delays for holidaymakers travelling to and from Alicante in May. 

Jameson pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly on an aircraft and interfering with the performance of the duties of a member of the crew.

Appearing in Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex on Friday, Jameson of Middlesbrough, was jailed for six months.

The incident caused delays to many excited holidaymakers - in Alicante hundreds of tourists were delayed by three hours.

Youth worker Jaqui Nicholson, 35, from Wallsend in North Tyneside said: 'Our flight was initially delayed for 40 minutes but when we went to the gate we found out we were going to have to wait much longer.

'But there were no Easyjet representatives around to tell us what was going on.

'But Alicante airport is very small, so when the plane did finally arrive at around 1am the passengers were coming into the building just yards from where we were so we were asking them what had happened.

'They said there had been a scrap on board so the plane had to divert to Gatwick.

'When it landed they were taken off the plane and arrested apparently.'

Summersgill, of Fawcett Avenue, Middlesbrough, appeared before Mid-Sussex Magistrates Court on May 31 and pleaded guilty to being drunk on an aircraft.

She was fined £1,000 and magistrates also ordered her to pay £100 in costs.

Jameson, who was national novices amateur champion in 2007, was originally charged with the more serious offence of recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or persons on a plane.

But the prosecution offered no evidence on this offence and he admitted the two lesser charges.
