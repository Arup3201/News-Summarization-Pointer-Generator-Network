Iran will not retreat 'one iota' from its nuclear programme, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has vowed as he rejected a UN report claiming Tehran is on the verge of building an atomic bomb.

The Iranian president gave a passionate speech to thousands of supporters in central Iran, and broadcast on live state television, denouncing the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which published its findings today.

He hit out at the IAEA, saying it is discrediting itself by siding with 
'baseless' U.S. claims that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

The report, which was leaked last night, 
said Iran could start building a nuclear bomb in a matter of months.

Israel and the U.S. have yet to 
comment on the findings, but France this morning said it is ready to 
push for sanctions of 'an unprecedented scale' if Iran refuses to answer new questions about its nuclear programme.

Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that if Iran fails to answer concerns raised by the 
report, the international community should raise diplomatic pressure to a
new level.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the report ‘completely discredited’  Iran’s claims its nuclear programme is simply for energy production.

Mr Hague described the report findings as ‘grave’ and warned the Islamic Republic could trigger a regional arms race.

China isn't publicly commenting yet on the
U.N. assessment in a likely sign that it 
will wait for Washington and Moscow to signal their intentions. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hong Lei today said that Beijing is studying 
the report and repeated calls for dialogue and cooperation.

Speaking to supporters in the city of Shahrekord, Ahmadinejad said Iran will not stop 
its nuclear development, adopting a defiant position against the 
report, which could spur efforts for new sanctions against his country.

In its latest report on Iran, the UN 
International Atomic Energy Agency outlines the sum of its knowledge on 
the Islamic Republic's alleged secret nuclear weapons work, including:

He said: 'If you think you can change the 
situation of the world through putting pressures on Iran, you are deadly
wrong. The Iranian nation will not withdraw an iota.'

Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not weapons production.

Ahmadinejad's
regime is already thought to have built a top-secret explosives test 
facility at a site in Parchin, just outside Tehran, where it is 
conducting experiments to develop a weapon.

Scientists
are building hi-tech precision detonators which would be essential for a
nuclear device, and developing a uranium core for a nuclear warhead, 
the UN said.

The report 
also lays bare that Iranian scientists are trying to mount a nuclear 
payload into their Shahab 3 missiles - which can reach Israel, Iran’s 
arch foe.

The report compiled by Yukiya Amano is the strongest sign yet that Iran seeks to build a nuclear arsenal, despite Tehran's insistence its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes.

The
document claims that while some of the suspected secret nuclear work by
Iran can have peaceful purposes, 'others are specific to nuclear 
weapons.'

A 13-page 
attachment to the agency's Iran report details intelligence and IAEA 
research that shows Tehran working on all aspects of research toward 
making a nuclear weapon, including fitting a warhead onto a missile.

The U.S. State Department said it needed
time to study a new report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on 
Iran's nuclear activities and declined to make any immediate comment on 
its contents.

Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said: 'This was released to member states 
about an hour ago so we're going to take some time to look at it before 
commenting.

'We are not prepared to talk about any next steps at this point.'

But with Israel threatening a military response, the report opens the way for a new confrontation between the West and Iran.

Ahead of the report's release, 
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak warned of a possible Israeli 
military strike against Iran's nuclear programme.

He
told Israel Radio that he did not expect any new U.N. sanctions on 
Tehran to persuade it to stop its nuclear defiance, adding: 'We continue
to recommend to our friends in the world and to ourselves, not to take 
any option off the table.'

The
'all options on the table' phrase is often used by Israeli politicians 
to mean a military assault.

Iran is pursuing its nuclear weapons program at the Parchin military base about 30 kilometres from Tehran, diplomatic sources in Vienna say

Parchin has hundreds of structures and a number of fortified tunnels and bunkers for carrying out explosive experiments, it is claimed

While
some of the suspected secret nuclear work outlined in the annex could 
also be used for peaceful purposes, 'others are specific to nuclear 
weapons', the report claims.

Some of the information contained in 
the annex was new - including evidence of a large metal chamber at a 
military site for nuclear-related explosives testing.

The bulk, however, was a compilation and expansion of alleged work already partially revealed by the agency.

But a senior diplomat familiar with 
the report said its significance lay in its comprehensiveness, thereby 
reflecting that Iran apparently had engaged in all aspects of testing 
that were needed to develop such a weapon.

Also significant was the agency's 
decision to share most of what it knows or suspect about Iran's secret 
work with the 35-nation IAEA board and the U.N. Security Council after being 
stonewalled by Tehran in its attempts to probe such allegations.

Copies of the report went to board members and the council, which has 
imposed four sets of U.N. sanction on Tehran for refusing to stop 
activities that could be used to make a nuclear weapon and refusing to 
cooperate with IAEA attempts to fully understand its nuclear program.

The agency said the annex was based on more than 1,000 pages of 
intelligence and other information forwarded by more than 10 nations and
material gathered by the IAEA itself.

The report suggests that Iran made computer models of a nuclear warhead 
and includes satellite imagery of a large steel container the IAEA 
believes is used for nuclear arms-related high explosives tests.

In remarks broadcast on state 
television, Ahmadinejad said that International Atomic Energy Agency 
chief Yukiya Amano was simply repeating U.S. allegations. 'He delivers 
the papers that American officials hand on him,' Ahmadinejad said.

'I am sorry that a person is heading 
the agency who has no power by himself and violates the agency's 
regulations, too.'

He repeated Iran's stance that it is 
not involved in making a nuclear weapon: 'They should know that if we 
want to remove the hand of the U.S. from the world, we do not need bombs
and hardware. We work based on thoughts, culture and logic.'
