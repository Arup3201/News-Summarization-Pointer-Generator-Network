ISIS have told shopkeepers in Iraq to put veils over the faces of their mannequins.

The jihadists handed out the ultimatum after seizing the country's second largest city, Mosul, during their latest offensive.

The move  is in line with strict interpretations of Shariah law forbidding artwork or statues depicting human form. 

Ultimatum: ISIS told shopkeepers to veil their mannequins after seizing Mosul during an offensive last month 

Window shopping: A woman walks past a store front and looks at the covered mannequins 

Both male and female mannequins in window displays have been covered up as a result.  

The militant group has imposed other restrictions in the city, the home to some of the most ancient Christian communities in the region.  

They have ordered Christians to convert to Islam, pay a tax or face death. Many from the ancient community have fled to the neighbouring autonomous region of Kurdistan as a result.

Mosul residents estimated the city's Christian population before last month's militant takeover at around 5,000, now only 200 are left. 

ISIS, which declared an Islamic State or 'caliph' spanning parts of Iraq and Syria earlier this month, seized control of Mosul in June as part of its campaign against the Baghdad government. 

Human Rights Watch have already said the Islamic State 'seems intent on wiping out all traces of minority groups from areas it now controls in Iraq.'

Strict: Male mannequins displaying a variety of polo shirts, shorts and jeans, have also been covered
