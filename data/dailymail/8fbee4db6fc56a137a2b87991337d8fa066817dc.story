When he burst onto the reality TV scene as one of the original cast members of The Only Way Is Essex, Mark Wright became synonymous with a glowing tan, pearly whites and a party boy lothario status.

But after leaving the hit ITV2 show in 2011, Mark insists that he has grown up a lot and - and says his debut perfume, unveiled yesterday, aims to reflect this.

Mark has launched both a male scent imaginatively named Mr Wright and female perfume called Mrs Wright, and he features in the smouldering promotional shot for both of them.

Mark Wright, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has launched his debut perfume collection - Mr and Mrs Wright

'I have been waiting a while to launch this. I love fragrances - I collect them - so creating my own perfume is quite honourable.

'This had to be completely my own. I have been perfecting it until it is totally right,' he told MailOnline.

Mark's female perfume has been described as an 'intricate, fruity, floral fragrance' with notes of lemon, peach, apple and grapefruit combined with jasmine, dry wood, amber and musk.

Created, he says, to reflect his perfect women, the fragrance is 'sweet, sexy and smart,' according to  25-year-old Mark.

Mark can be seen caressing the neck of the female model, who he handpicked himself, in his new shots but maintains that they are 'not cheesy but smart and classy'

As for Mr Wright, the scent is woody with floral notes and is based on his own personality and maturation.

He said: 'It is smart, dapper, strong and mature. I love to wear suits and be sharp and classy so Mr Wright reflects this.'

Baring an uncanny resemblance to Ryan Reynold's Hugo Boss perfume campaign, Mark describes the comparison as a 'good shout' and admits he did channel the Hollywood star.

'That is brilliant. I did go for a Ryan Reynolds look. I didn't want to do anything cheesy, it had to be classy and smart,' he said.

The imaginatively named perfumes were inspired by Mark's mature personality and his ideal woman

In the campaign shots, Mark can be seen dressed in a tuxedo, breathing int he scent of a brunette model's neck.

'I chose the model myself. That was a fun day,' he added.

Models aside though, who is the ideal Mrs Wright?

'Someone fun with a sweet innocence and respect for themselves,' he said.

And while his on-screen relationship with 26-year-old Lauren Goodger became almost as high profile as the show itself he maintains that they no longer speak.

'I still speak to Arg and he will definitely be getting one of my perfumes for Christmas but the other cast members weren't my friends, they were just co-workers.

Mark insists that he no longer speaks to his ex girlfriends from TOWIE (L) and has just signed up for another series of Take Me Out: The Gossip, where he presents alongside Zoe Hardman (R)

'Some of my exes are on the show too but I am not in touch with any of them,' he said.

While his people claim that, if sales go well, Mark could be 'bigger than Beckham', the presenter is somewhat more modest about this comparison.

'I don't really know what to say to that. Beckham is my absolute idol,' he said.

Bigger than Beckham of not, judging by his recent TV success (he has just signed up for another series of Take Me Out: The Gossip alongside close friend Zoe Hardman), the cheeky Essex boy's future is looking bright.

Mr Wright Pour Homme (£18.49, 100ml) and Mrs Wright Pour Femme (£14.99, 50ml EDP) are both available in The fragrance Shop, The Perfume Shop and Semichem now; a gift set is also available for Christmas 2012.
