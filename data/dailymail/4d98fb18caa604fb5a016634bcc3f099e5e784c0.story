Bonkbuster novelist E L James, author of Fifty Shades Of Grey, is said to remain resolutely grounded despite the £40million wealth she has amassed from her 100 million book sales.

But for all her understatedness, James does allow herself the odd flourish.

This week, she was seen near her London home in a Chelsea tractor sporting a rather fruity personalised number plate.

50 Shades Of Grey author E L James (pictured in the car) has spent some of her £40 million fortune on a rather fitting personalised number plate with the last three letters reading 'SXY'

Suitably, for someone whose books explore sadomasochistic sex, the last three letters read ‘SXY.’

This display of vulgarity coincides with the release of the film adaptation of her book on Valentine’s Day. 

Has Hollywood gone to her head?
