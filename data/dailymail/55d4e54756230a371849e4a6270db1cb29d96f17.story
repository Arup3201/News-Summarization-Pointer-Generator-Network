Pixie Lott's other half really does have the model Midas touch.

Fashion label Superdry has followed M&S in reporting a surge in sales since he started fronting their campaigns.

Oliver Cheshire, 24, has been modeling for nine years walking catwalks all over the world for brands including Dolce & Gabbana and Calvin Klein. But in the past 12 months things have really taken off for the young boy from Hertfordshire.

Superdry follows M&S in reporting unprecedented sales since he started fronting their campaigns

Cheshire is the current face
 of Superdry and fast becoming the young male model to look out for 
after the clothing brand announced sales last week up by 14.7 per
 cent.

The campaign images, shot around London's skyline, show a chiselled Oliver wearing the brand's signature laid-back pieces inlcuding printed T-shirts, camouflage jackets, denim shorts

Last season Marks and Spencer announced a 50% increase in the sale of men’s swimwear whilst Oliver was fronting their campaign.

A spokesman for Marks & Spencer 
said: 'Oliver was a great choice for the collection as he's a 
recognised British face. He is also well known for his personal style 
which gives him real credibility.

'We
 were delighted with the interest in and response to the images, he 
fitted perfectly with the British mood in fashion during 2012 making him
 the ideal face.'

Oliver joined Select Model Management
 after being scouted by them at Clothes Show Live whilst studying drama 
and is well known for his unique sense of style.

He writes a fashion blog 
iwearthetrousers.blogspot.co.uk in his spare time and has also reported 
on Men's Fashion Week for magazines such as GQ.

Tandy Anderson the Founder of Select Model Management, said: 'When we suggest any of our models for campaigns we work really hard to ensure that they reflect the core values of the brand so that the imagery is inspirational for their customers.

'From high fashion to high street fashion, everyone gets Oliver’s look.

'Like a young DiCaprio at the start of his career, in front of the camera he has a real versatility and appeal - he's the new everyman of modelling, he is genuinely a face to watch out for.'
