Designer sunglasses are all the rage, with celebrities such Kate Moss, Megan Fox, Cara Delevigne and Ryan Gosling often pictured hiding behind an expensive pair.

But in terms of eye protection, they might not be worth the money.

Discount sunglasses were just as good at blocking our harmful rays as expensive designer pairs, an investigation by U.S. eye specialists has found.

Dr Dennis Fong, a professor at the School of Optometry at the University of California Berkeley, found discount sunglasses costing less than £10 were just as good at blocking out 100 per cent of the sun’s harmful UVA and UVB rays.

Choosing the right sunglasses is important as opticians recommend wearing them whenever in strong sunshine for longer than 10 minutes.

This means from mid April until the end of September - when the levels of UV rays are three times higher at midday than they are during the winter. The levels of UVB during the summer can be as much as ten times higher. 

It is well known that UV light can cause damage to the eyes which often accumulates over the years, leading to sight problems.

The UV rays from the sun - in particular UVB, the same spectrum of ultraviolet that causes the skin to burn - are most damaging to the eyes.

UVB causes cataracts to form, meaning the eye’s lens becomes cloudy in places. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness in the world. 

Sun damage can also cause macular degeneration of the eye, which can lead to loss of vision as well as growths on the cornea, the surface of the eye, which sometimes effect vision and are usually considered ugly.

When choosing sunglasses look for one of the following:

Other long-term damage includes pinguecula, harmless but unsightly yellow fatty deposits in the white of the eye thought to be caused by UV damage to the collagen in the conjunctiva (the clear coating on the white of the eye). 

Photo keratitis - also known as snow blindness - can occur - when intense sun kills off the outer layers of the cornea (the clear part of the eye at the front of the eyeball).

There is also the risk of skin cancer of the eyelid.

As part of the new investigation into cheap versus expensive sunglasses, Dr Fong bought sunglasses from designer labels Coach, Ray-Ban and Smith.

All the designer sunglasses cost over $100 each (almost £62).

He also bought 11 cheaper pairs from shopping centre kiosks, pharmacies, fashion stores and street vendors which all cost about $10 each (£6.20).

A spectrophotometer- a specialist machine which can measure light- was used to measure the UV light passing through the lenses.

He found that the cheap sunglasses performed just as well as the expensive ones, with all pairs living up to their promise of blocking 100 per cent of UVA and UVB rays.

While there was no difference in terms of the protection against harmful rays, Dr Fong said pricier glasses often do have more durable frames, higher-end design and a more comfortable fit. 

The investigation was shown on Good Morning America by ABC News.

In previous investigations, opticians have warned that dark coloured lenses don't necessarily provide better protection than lighter coloured lenses.

The UV filtering, the coating added to lenses so that they block out harmful rays, comes from a film incorporated into the lens not through the actual colour of the lenses. 

An eye specialist from the University of California, in Berkeley, U.S., found that discount sunglasses costing less than £10 were just as good at blocking out 100 per cent of the sun’s harmful UVA and UVB rays as designer pairs costing more than £50
