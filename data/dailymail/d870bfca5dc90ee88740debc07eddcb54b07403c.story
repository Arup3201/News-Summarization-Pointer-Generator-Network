Jeffrey M. Sirois told police he intended to send a video to his girlfriend, but mistakenly sent it to the players

A high school varsity girls soccer coach told police he intended to send a video of him pleasuring himself to his girlfriend, but mistakenly sent it to the teenage girls on his team.

Jeffrey M. Sirois who worked at E.O. Smith High School was arrested earlier this month on charges of risk of injury to a child, breach of peace and obscenity, reports The Journal Inquirer of Manchester.

The arrest warrant says the 57-year-old of Lebanon intended to send the video to his girlfriend, but accidentally sent it to a Snapchat group of his soccer players who are juveniles.

Five players attending the high school in Storrs said they viewed the 10-second video at a pizza restaurant.

The girls told varsity girls volleyball coach and in turn the police were contacted.

The video does not show Sirois' face but showed furniture which police checked against that in his home. 

In an interview with state police, Sirois said he never intentionally sent anything inappropriate to his players, reports Courant.com.

'I was attempted to send a video of myself in which I was masturbating,' he said according to the warrant. 

'I was making the video to send to my girlfriend. It is something she and I occasionally do.'

He said when only realised what he had done when he checked to see if his girlfriend had received the clip.

He told police that he then saw that he had sent it to the girls and immediately he deleted the video.
