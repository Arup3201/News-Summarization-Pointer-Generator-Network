Tiny and innocent, little Danica May Camacho peers out at the world just moments after her birth at a hospital in the Philippines.

Wearing a hat to keep the heat from escaping through her head, she nestles against her mother's skin as her proud parents look on.

However, Danica's birth is not only significant to mother Camille and father Florante. She is one of the world's symbolic seven billionth occupants.

The Philippines, ranked 12th as the most populated 
country in the world, joined the rest of the world as it welcomed its 
symbolic seven billionth baby in a simple ceremony at the hospital.

Danica was born two minutes before 
midnight and arrived to a celebratory cheer at the packed Government-run
 Jose Fabella Hospital in Manila.

Weighing 5lbs 5oz, 
Danica May Camacho was delivered amid an 
explosion of media flash bulbs in the delivery room at Manila's Jose 
Fabella Memorial Hospital.

Mother Camille Dalura said: 'She looks so lovely. I can't believe she is the world's seventh billion.'

The baby is the second child for Camille and her partner Florante, who quietly stood in a corner 
wearing a white hospital gown as television crews and photographers 
crowded to get a shot of his daughter.

The parents and the baby were met by top United Nations officials in the Philippines, who presented the child with a small cake.

There were also gifts from local 
benefactors including a scholarship grant for the child's study, and a 
livelihood package to enable the parents to start a general store.

Also on hand to witness the landmark 
event was 12-year-old Lorrize Mae Guevarra, who was declared the world's
 symbolic six billionth baby in 1999 and is now in the sixth grade.

Guevarra said: 'I am very happy to 
see this cute baby. I hope like me she will grow up to become healthy 
and well loved by everyone.'

The child is one of several in 
countries around the world being declared a symbolic seven billionth 
human.The United Nations has declared October 31 as Seven Billion day - 
the date when the  globe's population is estimated to reach seven 
billion.

It was hoped she would arrive at exactly midnight, but she was delivered two minutes early.

Health Secretary Enrique Ona said the
 arrival of the world's seven billionth baby also presented the 
Philippines with an opportunity to assess population related issues.

According to the UN Population Fund 
(UNFPA) State of the World Population Report, the Philippines is the 
12th most populous country in the world with 94.9 million people.

China continues to have the biggest share of the population at 1.35 billion, followed by India at 1.24 billion.

The report noted that in many parts 
of the developing world, where population growth outpaces economic 
growth, reproductive health care remains a crucial issue.

UNFPA representative Ugochi Daniels 
said that while the Philippine population remains young, with people 
under 25 making up 54 percent of the total, they needed to be taught 
proper 'life skills' and about sexual issues.

She said that while women were having fewer children globally, the overall population continued to go up.

'While our world of seven billion 
represents a complex picture of trends and paradoxes, there are some 
essential global truths we observe,' she said. 'Conversely, there is no one global population outlook.'

The UNFPA said 10 percent of Filipino 
girls aged 15 to 19 have started child bearing, with many of the young 
also increasingly vulnerable to HIV.

There is scepticism over the accuracy
 of the UN's Seven Billion Day estimation, with critics saying there is 
no way of truly telling when the population of the human race hits the 
landmark.

In the past century, the world’s 
population has increased fourfold. And it has only been 12 years since 
the planet marked six billion people.

Many
 independent demographers say the UN has jumped the gun. Early 2013 is 
their best guess, but it could be as late as 2019 that the landmark is reached.
