Caretaker Rangers manager Kenny McDowall has revealed the club's board left it to him to break the news to Ian Durrant that he was being demoted.

Departing manager Ally McCoist was put on gardening leave on Sunday night as the club decided it could not let him run down his 12-month notice period in the Ibrox hotseat.

McDowall has now been put in temporary charge until the end of the season, with Under 20s coach Gordon Durie and skipper Lee McCulloch added to the first-team's backroom staff.

But former Gers midfielder Durrant's future now looks to be in some doubt after McDowall explained that he was ordered to dispel with Durrant's services from his set-up and instead make him coach the club's youth team.

Former Partick and St Mirren striker McDowall, who was handed the reins after late-night talks with Sandy Easdale and Derek Llambias at Ibrox on Sunday, said: 'The board intimated to myself that Ally had been put on gardening leave and they told me they were going to make some changes to the structure of the coaching team.

'Gordon was to come up from the 20s to assist me and they wanted to make Lee a player/coach and I was to start immediately.

'Was my opinion sought? No they asked me if I could make those changes immediately. But the decision was made by them.

'As for Durrant, that was the board's decision too. They asked me to carry it out which I duly did.

'I was asked to inform the guys of the changes being made.'Â
