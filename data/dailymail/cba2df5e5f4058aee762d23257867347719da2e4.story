The 21-year-old Wisconsin college gymnast who was found dead in a restaurant's dumbwaiter may have reached inside the device after pushing the elevator button, it today emerged.

Brooke Baures might have been alone in an upstairs section of the WingDam Saloon and Grill in Minnesota when she pressed the button to send the dumbwaiter to the first floor, officials claim. 

However, she possibly then 'noticed something and may have reached for it', before getting stuck inside the machine in a 'freak accident', Buffalo County Sheriff, Mike Schmidtknecht, said.

The Winona State University student was 'found trapped inside the entirety' of the dumbwaiter by a horrified co-worker at around 8pm on Monday, Fountain City Police Chief, Jason Mork, said.

Speaking to the Winona Daily News, Mr Mork added: 'To explain more of her specific location, orientation or obvious injuries would require an extremely graphic explanation.'

In a harrowing 911 call, Miss Baures's unnamed co-worker told the dispatcher they had discovered her body after apparently opening the elevator to shuttle drinks and food between floors.

'I think one of my co-workers got (caught) in, like, our dumbwaiter,' the co-worker explained through tears. 'But I'm not willing to look close enough.'

The dispatcher then asked another employee at the Fountain City venue to look at Miss Baures's apparently contorted remains, according to the recording obtained by the newspaper.

The employee confirmed: 'It's her. We need someone here like ASAP,

As students of Winona State University mourned, and held a candlelit vigil for Miss Baures - nicknamed 'Tink' - authorities began trying to peace together what killed the beloved  gymnast.

The Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have each launched independent investigations into the incident. 

However, several days on, they still cannot find anyone among two dozen witnesses who saw Miss Baures get into the 3ftx3ft machine. They remain confident no crime was committed. 

On Wednesday, Mr Mork said he had interviewed around half of the customers and employees present at the restaurant on Monday. So far, no one saw how the student entered the dumbwaiter.

He added that no employees had ever reached into the dumbwaiter in the past.

Miss Baures was twice named the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference gymnast of the week this year and documented her athletics career enthusiastically on social media.

She was described by friends and family as a 'strong, determined, and beautiful young woman' at the candlelit vigil held on the University campus.

On Wednesday, Miss Baures's teammates from Winona State University led the tributes to the gymnast, saying 'she was literally everything to the team.' 

Brooke Hiestand, a member of Winona State Warriors, said: 'She was the person that held us together, and if you had something that you didn't know what to do...for some reason, she always knew the answer...always.' 

Miss Baures's boyfriend  Joel Hinke, who played for the Winona State Warriors football team, broke down as he spoke about how he had planned to marry her.

College officials also paid tribute to Miss Baures, who was an accomplished member of the gymnastics team from 2011 to 2014.

'She was a leader on the team and a talented gymnast,' said WSU athletic director Eric Schoh in a statement. 

'This is a tremendous loss for our community, and we ask that you keep Brooke and her family, friends, coaches and teammates in your thoughts.' 

Amanda Schabacker, manager at WingDam Saloon & Grill, told the Winona Daily News that the restaurant would be closed on Tuesday and refused to offer any more comment. 

Photographs posted to social media show Miss Baures and her family happily posing for pictures at Warriors games.

The student was also a huge music fan and on her Facebook page posted a picture on November 22 with herself and country music stars Dan + Shay along with the caption: 'OMG OMG'.

Tributes from distraught friends have been flooding onto social media since her death was announced on December 1.

Friend Annelie Schmittel posted: 'Thoughts and prayers go out to the family of my former student Brooke Baures, as well as my WSU Warriors family. Devastating news.'

According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, dumbwaiter accidents are rare. Only two incidents, both fatal, have happened in the U.S. between 2003 and 2013.

Miss Baures's autopsy results are still pending.
