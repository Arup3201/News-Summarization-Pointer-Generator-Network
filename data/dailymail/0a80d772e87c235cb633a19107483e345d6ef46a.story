In a  discovery that has shocked everyone involved, experts have found DNA can survive the harsh conditions of space as well as re-entry into the atmosphere.

Scientists who attached small double strands of DNA to the outer casing of a rocket said they were 'completely surprised' when more than half the samples remained intact. 

This was despite temperatures soaring to more than 1,000°C (1,800°F) during the short flight to sub-orbital space and back, and it raises the possibility of extraterrestrial life molecules arriving on Earth from space. 

Scientists at the University of Zurich have discovered that DNA can survive the harsh conditions of space and re-entry into the atmosphere. The  finding was made by attaching DNA to the outer casing of a rocket, shown launching from the Esrange base in Kiruna, Sweden. It has led to questions about the origin of life on Earth

The research, published online in the journal Plos One, was carried out by scientists from the University of Zurich in Switzerland.

The Texus-49 sub-orbital mission launched from the European base of Esrange in Kiruna, northern Sweden, and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket.

But scientists decided, in addition, to test the effects space travel has on DNA when carried at three positions on the rocket's outer casing - and found it survived.

Panspermia is the theory that life exists throughout the universe and is spread by asteroids and comets, in addition to simply drifting through the cosmos.

Panspermia proposes life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life.

These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks.

If met with ideal conditions on a new planet's surface, the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins, it is believed. 

Many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the Earth early in its history.

But some go further and suggest that DNA, the essential molecule of life itself, could reach the Earth in meteoric dust, 100 tonnes of which hit the planet each day - a theory known as panspermia.

During the experiment, around 53 per cent of the DNA was recovered from the grooves in screw heads, and more than a third remained fully functional.

The 'plasmid' DNA carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance.

It was shown to function by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria, and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells.

Dr Cora Thiel, one of the scientists from the University of Zurich, said: 'We were completely surprised to find so much intact and functionally active DNA.'

Professor Oliver Ullrich, from the same university, added: 'This study provides experimental evidence that the DNA's genetic information is essentially capable of surviving the extreme conditions of space and the re-entry into Earth's dense atmosphere.'

The research also suggested that scientists conducting space missions to other planets needed to be careful about contamination.

Proffesor Ullrich said: 'The results show that it is by no means unlikely that, despite all the safety precautions, space ships could also carry terrestrial DNA to their landing site.

'We need to have this under control in the search for extraterrestrial life.'  

Back in August, traces of plankton and other microorganisms were found living on the exterior of the International Space Station (ISS) by Russian cosmonauts.

They claim the plankton were not carried there at launch - but are thought to have been blown there by air currents on Earth.

Incredibly, the tiny organisms were found to be able to survive in the vacuum of space despite the freezing temperatures, lack of oxygen and cosmic radiation.

Some said the plankton may simply have been contamination from other areas of the ISS.

Nonetheless, the discovery appeared to prove extremely primitive life could survive in the harsh environment of space.

And, coupled with this latest research, the finding raises interesting questions about the origin of life on Earth.

Many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the early Earth.

Scientists at the University of Zurich discover DNA can survive re-entry

The remarkable finding was made by attaching DNA to a rocket

@highlight

It was subjected to temperatures of more than 1,000°C (1,800°F) at launch

@highlight

But, when brought back to Earth, the DNA was found to still function

'We were completely surprised,' said Dr Cora Thiel of the university

@highlight

It supports the theory that life on Earth came from space

And it follows the discovery of plankton on the exterior of the ISS in August
