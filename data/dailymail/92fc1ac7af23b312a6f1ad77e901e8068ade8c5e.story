Lynette Nock died after taking the banned party drug GBL during a wake for her friend who was killed by the same lethal substance hours earlier

A successful accountant died after taking a party drug during an impromptu 'wake' for her friend who had been killed by the same substance just hours earlier, an inquest has heard.

Aston Martin engineer Carl Fearon, 24, was found dead on a friend's sofa after taking the banned drug GBL.

Just hours later his friend Lynette Nock, 28, took the same drug -  which is sold as an alloy wheel cleaner - during an impromptu wake held in his honour at her home.

She lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital but died later the same day.

An inquest heard the pair were part of a group of 'ravers' who used recreational drugs including horse tranquilizer Ketamine and Mephedrone at weekends.

Recording a verdict that both friends had died of drug-related deaths, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull Louise Hunt issued a grave warning to people taking legal highs.

She said: 'This case highlights the very extreme risks that people take when using legal highs, particularly in combination with alcohol.

'These substances shouldn't be taken and they do have a traumatic effect which your family is living through for the rest of their lives.'

Mr Fearon, from Kings Norton, Birmingham, had returned to his friend Matthew Hayes' flat in the city centre on April 27, 2012 when he began 'swaying' and collapsed, the inquest heard.

Mr Hayes told the inquest: 'He fell against the other wall and I grabbed him and lay him on the settee.

'We'd seen it a thousand times before with everybody else. It was normal.'

The friend said he checked he was breathing before going to bed but was shocked to discover him dead when he returned from a trip to the shop the next morning.

He added: 'I checked his pulse but there was nothing. I tried everything to make him wake up.'

Mr Fearon's father Brian told the inquest he had spoken to his son on the morning before his death and warned him not do anything 'daft'.

He said: 'He said he was going out with the lads for a drink. I said "don't do anything daft" and he said "I won't dad".

'We were aware that he took recreational drugs. I'd spoken to him various times about it.

'Carl's idea of recreational drugs was that they were safer. As he put it, more people die from drinking than smoking or recreational drugs.

'As far as I'm aware, for almost four months he hadn't taken anything. He was full of beans, full of life.'

Miss Nock collapsed just hours later at her home in Northfield, Birmingham.

Doctors worked on her for 45 minutes after she was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham but couldn't save her.

The inquest heard a toxicology report found Ketamine and small amounts of methadrone were also found in her system along with GBL.

Her boyfriend Graeme Cooper described her as a 'free spirit' and said he had warned her against taking any legal highs.

He told the hearing: 'Before I left, the last thing I said to her was not to take any of it.

'Those were my last words to her. When I came back she was completely unconscious.'

Detective Constable Julia Woodall said witnesses told them Lynette had begun to behave erratically at the wake, falling over and 'spinning around a washing pole'.

The West Midlands Police officer said an extensive investigation had traced the drugs to a German supplier, who has now been shut down.

She added: 'It was very cheap to buy and import in large quantities and you take it in a very small dose.'

Two other men also needed medical treatment after the wake.

Paying tribute to Lynette after her death in 2012, her devastated parents Dave and Tracie said: 'She was really bright, in fact school was too easy for her.

'She was like an agony aunt and was so kind that she would get into trouble with debt collectors because she would lend her friends money.

'The whole family is in shock. It's just tragic when parents lose a child.'

Friends of Mr Fearon, nicknamed 'Fee', also paid tribute to him on a Facebook memorial page.

The Class C drug GBL, which has a similar effect as ecstasy and alcohol, was banned in December 2009 following a spate of deaths.

Nicknamed 'Coma in a Bottle', it is illegal to take as a stimulant but can be imported from Europe for its intended use as an industrial cleaner.

A close relative of GBL is also used by date rapists to spike drinks because it is odourless and colourless and can be out of a victim's system within 12 hours.
