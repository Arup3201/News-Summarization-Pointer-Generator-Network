CLICK HERE to read Matt Lawton assessment of Roy Keane's explosive press conference 

Gordon Strachan will exercise his right of reply to Roy Keane's book comments after Scotland's 2016 European Championship qualifying double-header against Georgia and Poland.

In his explosive new autobiography, the Irishman said defiance underpinned his move to Celtic in January 2006, as he claimed that then Hoops boss Strachan was less than enthusiastic.

Keane has claimed in his autobiography that he only signed for the Hoops to defy manager Strachan

Keane retired from playing six months after joining Celtic and collecting a domestic double

Keane said: 'I met Gordon Strachan in London at Dermot Desmond's (Celtic majority shareholder) house.

'Gordon told me 'I'm not really worried if you sign for us or not. We're okay without you'.

'He was letting me know he wasn't desperate for me; he was being a bit coy. But there was a bit of defiance from me.'

However, at his media conference ahead of the Group D game against Georgia at Ibrox on Saturday, Strachan laughed when asked what he thought about the Aston Villa assistant manager's comments.

He said: 'I think he is fantastic. I get on great with him.

Despite claims from the book, Strachan insists he has a 'smashing' relationship with Keane

'I have no idea what he said in his book, I am sure I will have a look but we get on smashing together.

'But this is not the right time to talk about his book. Come and see me in two weeks' time and we can talk about it when I have had time to read it.

'But I am sure it is interesting reading.

'It is always good fun and also it is a bit tongue in cheek with Roy at times.'
