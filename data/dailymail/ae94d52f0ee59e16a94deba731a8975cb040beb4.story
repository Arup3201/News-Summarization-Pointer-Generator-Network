'It will be a shock to everyone, especially us as players. We just have to deal with it as best we can really.'

When asked if he was aware of Gerrard's decision to leave Liverpool, Henderson replied: 'No, nobody had a clue. 

'Obviously we had seen stuff in the paper about if he was going to renew his contract but I think everyone thought it would get done eventually.'
