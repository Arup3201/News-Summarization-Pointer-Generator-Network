A bolt of lightning knocked out power to around 120,00 homes in southern California during a storm on Monday.

The fork of lightning struck a major bank of transformers at the Rector Station, just outside Visalia on Road 148 and Caldwell, causing it to burst into flames.

Firefighters battled for an hour to control the blaze but thousands of homes were without power last night and for many, it will not be restored until this evening, according to ABC30.

Southern California Edison (SCE) said in a statement damage to its facilities from the storms was 'significant' and it was working to quickly restore power to homes in the area.

The company also warned that more scattered thunderstorms were expected to continue for a few days.

Violent thunder storms were experienced across many parts of California yesterday, as the hot weather continued.

Giant forks of lightning were captured striking the ground close to Barstow, about 250 miles south east of Visalia, and San Francisco was also lit up by electrical storms overnight.

Nearly 4,000 additional homes and businesses lost power in the Barstow area, according to local news service, The Sun.

The lightning also caused more than a dozen small brush fires in the San Bernardino Mountains, in and around the arid San Bernardino County, close to Barstow, which is around 150 miles north east of LA.

SCE said it received reports of additional power outages in San Bernardino, Cedarpines Park, Lake Arrowhead, Fort Irwin, Perris, Lake Elsinore and other areas due to the lightning.

The local forecast for Visalia is for hot sunny weather, with temperatures reaching 39C (102F) today and tomorrow. The forecast is for thunderstorms today, but not tomorrow.

SCE spokesmanÂ David Songg, told local media: 'The storm weather pattern is expected to continue for the next few days.'

Multiple outages were reported across 
California yesterday; the electricity company said more than 350 
locations within its service were affected and additional crews were 
redirected to deal with restoring the power.

Storm-response operations were active 
in Tulare, Kern and San Bernardino counties and the cities of Redlands, 
Ridgecrest, Arrowhead and Menifee, SCE said.

According to ABC30, the impact of the 
outage was felt across more than 675 square miles in the southern 
valleys, affecting 120,000 customers.

The energy company said it had relocated restoration crews from other jobs in less affected areas to assist in the repairs.

The
company said: 'SCE recognizes this inconvenience to customers, and 
crews will be working overnight and throughout tomorrow to restore 
power.'

Meanwhile, 
firefighters said the blaze at the transformer station presented an 
unusual challenge because the facility was filled with oil, meaning they
could not use water on it.

So the crews had to stock up on dry ice from a local store.

Speaking
to ABC30, Mike Green, Tulare county fire department battalion chief, 
said: 'We went to the local Savemart store. They were gracious and gave 
us 15-20 lbs of dry ice. We brought it back and the Edison crew used a 
man lift to get near to the transformer and they were able to put the 
fire out.'

SCE spokesperson Bill DeLain added that there were no reported injuries and that the fire was handled safely by all personnel.
