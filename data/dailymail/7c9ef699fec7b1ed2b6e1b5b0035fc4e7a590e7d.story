Newly-appointed Leeds head coach Darko Milanic insists he does not fear the axe at Leeds despite the ruthless reputation of the club’s owner Massimo Cellino.

Slovenian Milanic has signed a two-year contract at Elland Road after being headhunted by Leeds sporting director Nicola Salerno.

The 46-year-old left Austrian Sturm Graz on Sunday just weeks into his second season in charge, having previously taken Maribor to multiple league tiles and participation in the Champions League.

Cellino sacked 36 managers in 22 years at his previous club Cagliari, and terminated Milanic’s predecessor Dave Hockaday’s reign after just six matches and 70 days.

However, Milanic shrugged off the statistics, reflecting that managerial life expectancies are short anyway.

“Our job is at risk on every game, I have to do my best. It doesn’t worry me,” he said, at his unveiling this morning.

“I’m very motivated and excited about the new job at Leeds United. I know this is a big traditional club with great supporters and they have very good quality in the team.”

Salerno, who flanked Milanic at the press conference, hinted at further recruits from the continent after revealing multilingual qualities as one of the new coach’s biggest attractions.

“We need an international coach because we have an international team,” Salerno said.

However, Milanic confirmed that Leeds’ habitual caretaker manager Neil Redfearn, who steered the Championship club to three wins and a draw in his recent stint in charge, will remain in the dugout for Saturday’s match against Brentford and beyond.

“In the first moment, it’s important to keep the ethusiasm. But I want to make some changes tactically,” said Milanic, who took his first training session on Tuesday.

“I will speak to Neil over the next few days because he knows the team very well. If I need to know something I will talk to him.”

Milanic is the eighth permanent managerial appointment Leeds have made since they dropped out of the Premier League 10 years ago and his primary task is to return them there with haste.

“When we talked last Sunday he told me my job is to make the squad better to stay better on the field and to be prepared to play in the Premier League,” he said, of his conversations with Cellino.

“I made a great job with Maribor but not in one month. I have no time limit. I have to do a great job as soon as possible.”
