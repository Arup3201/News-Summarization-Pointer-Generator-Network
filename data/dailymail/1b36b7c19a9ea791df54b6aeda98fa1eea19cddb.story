Gareth Bale may be dubbed the Welsh Wizard because of his magical feet but the Real Madrid ace showed even he struggles for ball control on the odd occasion.

Former Tottenham striker Bale was left red faced when he was left on his bum as he tried to pull off some silky skills in Madrid training.

James Rodriguez, Pepe, Marcelo and Luka Modric are among the Madrid teammates who enjoy a laugh at the expense of the Welsh international.

Pepe and Marcelo join in the laughter as they all tease the Cardiff born attacker during their training session

Bale has come under scrutiny in recent weeks but the Madrid players are quick to show there is no ill feeling towards the 25-year-old as they share the joke.

Those laughs could continue into this week if they perform well against Elche on Sunday night in the late kick off.

Madrid can go four points clear at the top of the division with a win following Barcelona’s shock home defeat to Malaga on Saturday.
