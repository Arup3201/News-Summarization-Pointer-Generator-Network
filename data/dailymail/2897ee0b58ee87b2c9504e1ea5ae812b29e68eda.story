Swansea have won three Premier League games in a row for the first time since August 2012. 

Sean Dyche estimated recently that he has made more than 500 telephone calls in efforts to build a squad that might keep Burnley in the Barclays Premier League.

What isn’t known is how often Ross McCormack’s name came into the conversation and ruined everything. 

The striker’s £11million move from Leeds to Fulham not only stunned the selling club but also sent a shockwave through the transfer market, which is unfortunate for Dyche.

His side, with the exception of the first half, were good in the defeat at Swansea. But good won’t quite be enough if they continue to lack a creative edge, or the tactical options to match the numerous teams that play five in midfield, as Swansea did.

Dyche admitted on Saturday that Burnley want new blood, having used only 23 players in the Championship. But at a time when a second-tier striker can cost £11m, Dyche’s sensible approach to spending might be at odds with the market.

He said: ‘The challenge is obvious — how much have you got and how much can you spend? Everyone wants the prices up.

‘Some Championship clubs pay more in wages than we do now in the Premier League. The biggest challenge this season has been the McCormack deal. I think that surprised everyone.

‘I respect him as a player, of course, but the finance that was put into that deal raised everyone’s level. Anyone who is sub-£11m (clubs that would not normally spend £11m on a player) is affected by that.’

For Dyche, it is proving to be quite a problem. His task in consolidating against Premier League resources is daunting, with their record now two defeats in two. He has spent £5m assembling this side and insisted at the weekend that club policy dictates he cannot spend big.

‘The club made it quite clear there are guidelines I have to work in and that’s part of my role,’ he said. ‘We are aligned, though, because there is no point in me saying we have £25m to spend.’

Swansea led through Nathan Dyer’s first-half goal, but were forced to fight for their win after the break.

Their captain Ashley Williams admitted the side have tried to add an extra physicality to their normal passing game.

He said: ‘People think we are a passing side and a bit weak and a pushover. We want to address it and this was a day for that. Sometimes you have to win ugly and we did that.’
