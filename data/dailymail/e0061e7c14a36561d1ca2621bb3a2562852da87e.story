Jokey Rosie Napravnik, the first female rider to win the $2 million Breeders' Cup race in its 31-year history, announced her retirement just moments after winning the race on Friday.

Napravnik stunned the crowd at Santa Anita Park, after the race, by announcing that she is also pregnant and as a mother-to-be wants to step back from the sport.

She said that she will begin her retirement on Sunday as she is now seven weeks pregnant with her husband Joe Sharp.

I've got news for you! Moments after her win, Napravnik announced on national television to her mother that she will begin her retirement Sunday as she’s 7 weeks pregnant with her husband Joe Sharp

Napravnik, 26, told her mother the amazing news in the winner's circle.

'I wanted to tell you in person,' Napravnik said to her mom, Cindy.

'My husband Joe Sharp and I are going to be starting a family,' Napravnik, told reporters, saying her retirement would start on Sunday after she had raced for a final time on Saturday, the last day of the 2014 Breeders' Cup.

'His career (as a horse trainer) is brand new and thriving, so it's kind of good timing. He's going to step into the limelight and I'm going to step out.

'I've been planning the retirement since I found out that I was pregnant. I'm about seven weeks pregnant. Couldn't think of a better way to go out.'

Incredible news: Rosie Napravnik, 26, told her mother, Cindy, in the winner's circle that she was seven weeks pregnant and the reaction of her mother is priceless 

The two hugged live on television as the news of Rosie's pregnancy was shared 

Dilemma: The champion jockey said she wanted her mom to be the first to know but realized she would have to reveal the news to everyone at the same time 

Untapable, winner of the Kentucky Oaks in May with Napravnik on board, surged past Iotapa from the outside coming into the final turn to win the Distaff by one and one-quarter lengths.

'What a tremendous feeling to be involved with this filly all year long and the races that she's giving us and how good she is,' Untapable's trainer Steven Asmussen said. 

'Rosie and Untapable have had a tremendous season.Today definitely makes her a champion and that's enough said. She's a champion. Just very proud to be associated with her.'

She will ride in four of the nine Cup races on Saturday before calling it quits.

She had planned to tell her mother about her pregnancy at dinner Friday night and announce the news publicly after Saturday's races, but Untapable helped change her mind.

Her mother, Cindy, looked on in shock as Napravnik broke the news on TV.

Understatment: 'I told you I would five you good television!' said Rosie as he mom still lets the news of her impending pregnancy sink in

Bombshell: Napravnik stunned the crowd at Santa Anita and a national television audience by announcing she will retire Sunday. The 26-year-old said she and husband Joe Sharp, who is a trainer, plan to start a family

Napravnik won her first race in June 2005 and became the first woman to win the Kentucky Oaks with Believe You Can in 2012. She and Untapable teamed to win the Oaks in May. Napravnik joined Julie Krone as the only female riders to win a Cup race.

Napravnik's best finish in a Triple Crown race was third in the 2013 Preakness with Mylute.

Napravnik, who finished second aboard Tapiture in the $1 million Dirt Mile earlier, didn't rule out a return to the saddle.

'It's indefinite. I'm not thinking about a comeback in 10 months,' she said. 'I can't promise to stay off a horse forever.' 

'My actual plan for the near future is, I'm going to be working in the barn with Joe. He started training on his own, his training career is thriving already, and his stable tripled in size in the first month and a half,' the jockey said. 

'He's getting more and more calls, and the sky's really the limit for his career.

'It's great timing to be there and support him so I'm going to be working in the barn, which is something I've really missed, doing the actual hands-on horsecare rather than just hop on, hop off, so I'm really excited and I'm still going to be very much involved in the racing.'
