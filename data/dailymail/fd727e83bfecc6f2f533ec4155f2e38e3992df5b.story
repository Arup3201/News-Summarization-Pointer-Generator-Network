The Russian tycoon who was punched by newspaper magnate Alexander Lebedev on a TV talk show has been detained in Cambodia accused of threatening six sailors at knifepoint and forcing them to jump into the sea.

Sergei Polonsky, 40, faces charges of premeditated violence and false imprisonment after a New Year party went wrong, said prosecutor Huot Vicheth at Sihanoukville court.

The former property billionaire’s aides claimed he was released after agreeing not to leave Cambodia, where he owns an island and is living in exile as investors try to force his extradition and prosecution over alleged debts.

Local sources and the Russian consul denied he had been released from custody.

Mr Polonsky is likely to be Russian prosecutors’ main witness in the case against Mr Lebedev, 53, whose family own the Independent titles and the London Evening Standard.

The six Cambodian sailors told military police they were locked in a boat cabin and were then forced to jump into the sea.

Mr Polonsky’s spokesman said the tycoon and two male friends aged 24 and 25 were holding a party on a small island when their fireworks attracted attention from a military base.

The sailors were believed to  be part of a crew escorting the Russians back to the mainland.

In a blog posting, Mr Polonsky claimed his New Year was a ‘perfect celebration’, adding: ‘Peace to everyone, I forgive everyone.’
