A subterranean cycle and walking network using London's abandoned Tube tunnels is being proposed.

The London Underline would be lined  with kinetic paving, which uses friction from cycle tyres and shoes to generate electricity to power the project.

Although the plan may look unlikely it won the Best Conceptual Project at the London Planning Awards last night, presented to designer Gensler by Mayor Boris Johnson.

The route could run under central London from Holborn in the east to Green Park in the west with docking stations for the capital's 'Boris Bike' scheme dotted along the tunnels.

Grand plan: Maverick designers are proposing an underground cycle and walking network using central London's disused tunnels  

Connected: The proposal, which won a prestigious design award last night, would be linked to the capital's existing transport network like the cycle superhighways, and it would be lined with kinetic paving to generate electricity from friction

London Underline would also be connected to overground cycle lanes and bridges spanning the Thames.  

Ian Mulcahey, co-director of Gensler London, says 'Now that London has reached the highest level of population in its history we need to think creatively about how to maximize the potential of our infrastructure. 

'The adaptation of surplus and underutilized tube and rail tunnels could provide a quick and simple addition to our infrastructure network.'

Gensler designers also believe that there could be room for a network of shops and businesses and even space for an underground park. 

Tunnels would not be the only spaces used, with former telephone exchanges, stations even and reservoir chambers part of the plans.

New use: The empty tunnels and other spaces could be used for businesses, events and even public art to generate money

Connectivity: The focus would be on a main tunnel running from Holborn in the east to Green Park in the West. The route would also be linked to existing and new bridges

Architect Trevor To said: 'Gensler's proposal brings back an ignored part of the city through the collective efforts of its citizens. By harnessing the kinetic energy of every one's footsteps, a whole new urban space is unlocked underneath the city. 

'This self-sustaining approach to urban infrastructure is key to a carbon-neutral community, and London could lead the world once again in merging tradition with innovation to create a better future.' 

London Underground would also offer new sites for pop-up businesses, exhibitions, retail and event space to generate money.
