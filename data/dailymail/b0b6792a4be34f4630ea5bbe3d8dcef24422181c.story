Newcastle midfielder Siem de Jong will return to training on Thursday after recovering from a collapsed lung as he bids to play again this season.

The 26-year-old Holland international has managed only three appearances for the club since his £6million summer arrival from Ajax, but could yet figure before the end of the campaign after being given the green light by medics to step up his comeback plans.

De Jong revealed the news via his Twitter account on Wednesday afternoon, saying: 'The last X-ray was all good! So tomorrow I will start training for myself again. #NUFC #comebackstronger'.

De Jong has been a spectator at St James' Park for much of the season

The news will come as a boost to beleaguered head coach John Carver, whose squad has been decimated by injury and suspension in recent weeks.

De Jong's last appearance came in the 3-3 Barclays Premier League draw with Crystal Palace at St James' Park on August 30 last year.

He suffered a torn thigh muscle days later which sidelined him for more than four months, and he was on the verge of returning to the squad last month when he suffered a collapsed lung for the second time in his career.

The Dutchman underwent surgery which should prevent a recurrence of the problem and has now been given the all-clear to resume training, and he will hope to be able to make a belated impact with nine games of the season remaining.
