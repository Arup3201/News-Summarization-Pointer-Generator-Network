The mother of a man who died in a prison fire after being sent back to Honduras despite receiving a stay of deportation is suing the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement for his death.

Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez, 20, arrived in the U.S. seeking asylum in 2008 to escape gang members who were trying to recruit him.

He was ordered deported when he missed a hearing in Immigration Court, but his attorney Joseph Huprich filed an emergency motion and Avila-Lopez was granted an emergency stay of deportation.

Two weeks later, Avila-Lopez was in ICE shackles and on his way back to Honduras, where he was arrested without charge and taken to the notorious Comayagua prison, his mother Ana Lopez says.

The Courthouse News Service reports that Ana Lopez claims her son was 'thrown, without formal charges, into the notorious Comayagua prison ... where he suffered unspeakable torture for nearly four months alongside the sadistic criminals that he sought to escape.'

Avila-Lopez, who was gay, fled to the United States when he was 17 after seeing the Mara 13 gang kill his friend and another man, his mother said. Gang members told authorities Nelson Avila-Lopez was responsible for one of the killings and he feared for his life.

The country's intolerance of gay people was another reason Avila-Lopez sought asylum.

His mother said Avila-Lopez missed his court hearing because his attorney did not tell him he was due in court.

After he failed to appear, a judge ordered him deported in March 2010. He was arrested by ICE and put in deportation proceedings, reports the Courthouse News Service.

A new attorney applied for the stay of deportation, which was granted. Ana Lopez says ICE knew of the stay of deportation, but on October 2011, her son was deported anyway.

'In the last four months of Nelson's life in this prison, Nelson was brutally tortured, including being held down to be tattooed on each arm - one by the Maras and the other by a rival gang - forever marking him as a traitor for all inmates to see,' Ana Lopez said

'Nelson, as young but brave as he was, refused to tell his mother the horrible conditions he encountered, but asking for money from her so that he could pay off the gangs so that he could use the prison bathroom.'

Nelson Avila-Lopez died in the deadliest fire ever to occur in Central America at the Comayagua prison along with 359 others on Valentine's Day 2012.

He was just shy of his 21st birthday.

His body was so badly burnt that he could only be identified by DNA testing.

According to the Courthouse News Service, Ana Lopez is seeking damages for negligence, wrongful death and due process violations.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice told the Los Angeles Times in March 2012 that the agency did not receive notice of the courtâ€™s stay of deportation until October 20, hours after Avila-Lopez was put on a plane to Honduras.

The agency, she said, 'goes to great lengths' to ensure there are no pending court actions a before someone is deported.
