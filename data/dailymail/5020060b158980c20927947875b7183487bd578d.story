Shai Piron, who is also a rabbi, could not get past the first sentence of the address because he was laughing so much.

A video of the hysterical minister has now gone viral on Israeli websites.

Shai Piron broke down in fits of giggles when he tried to read a speech with the word 'penetration' in it

Despite repeatedly attempting to regain his composure, Mr Piron could not get past the first sentence

Mr Piron was addressing Parliament on a new law against smuggling cell phones into prisons.

However, despite repeated attempts he could not get through the speech without laughing. 

He eventually had to abandon the attempt and let a cabinet colleague take over.

'Mr Chairman, distinguished Parliament, the aim of this legislation is to deal with a serious phenomenon - the penetration of prohibited objects into prisons,' he said during a late night session on Monday broadcast on the official Knesset TV channel.

He immediately began to giggle but then tried to recover his composure.

However, when audience members also began to laugh, Mr Piron could not contain himself.

He broke down again over the perceived sexual innuendo when the word 'penetration' came up in the text for a second time.

Legislators in the hall joined in the giggling.

Struggling to continue, Piron wiped tears from his eyes, took a sip of water, and coughed in a bid to stop laughing.

But he eventually abandoned the attempt and walked back to his seat, unable to read on.

He later explained to reporters that he had been caught off-guard by the phrasing in the speech, which he delivered at the last minute after a cabinet colleague was called away.

Rabbi Shai Piron eventually conceded defeat and left the podium to return to his seat
