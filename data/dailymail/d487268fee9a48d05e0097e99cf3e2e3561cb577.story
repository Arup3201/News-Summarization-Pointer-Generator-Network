Two young New Jersey high school sweethearts tragically died in a car crash over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

Monmouth University freshman Nicole Surace, 18, was in town to visit family Saturday night when the crash happened just before 8pm.

Her boyfriend, 17-year-old Spotswood High School senior Jeffrey Szatkowski, was behind the wheel of his 2004 Ford Mustang when he lost control of the car and it careened off road, hitting a telephone poll before flipping and landing on the roof.

Memorial: The couple were driving down a narrow stretch of road in East Brunswick when the crash happened

The crash happened on Dutch Road, a popular but narrow thoroughfare between Milltown, where Surace was from, and Spotswood, Szatkowski's hometown. The two towns share the high school so it's used by many teenagers.

An investigation into the crash is ongoing.

The two were taken to Robert Wood Johnson University hospital where they later died of their injuries.

All-American couple: Szatkowski was on both the football and baseball teams. When Surace was at Spotswood, she was the captain of the varsity cheerleading team. Surace graduated last year and was in her first year of college

Surace and Szatkowski were a popular pair at Spotswood High School, where they met and started dating about a year ago, according to their Facebook pages.

Their young relationship continued even after Surace graduated and started college.

Like many young couples, the two showed their love for each other on social media. One of Szatkowski's last tweets was dedicated to his 'amazing' girlfriend.

After hearing about the crash, about 100 of their friends gathered at the hospital to show support.

Best season in 11 years: Szatkowski's football coach said he was one of the reasons the team was doing so well this year

Most were student-athletes or coaches, who knew Surace from her days as the varsity cheerleading captain or Szatkowski, who was on both the football and baseball teams.

'It's way too early - there's no way she should have been done that soon,' Surace's cheerleading coach of 10 years, Kenny Wisniewski, told NJ.com.

Szatkowski's football coach Andy Cammarano attributed the team's 7-3 record to the lighthearted senior.

'We were never uptight before games because of Jeff,' he said. 'We had out best season in 11 years and Jeff was a huge part of that.'

Spotswood Athletics Director Bill Visokay was at the hospital with other members of the community mourning the young couple's loss.

'A parent should never have to bury their own kids and my heart and the heart of the school community really out to both families,' Mr Visokay told MyCJ.com.

'It was amazing to see the amount of support within the Spotswood school community, especially seeing so many parents, as well as student-athletes, at a time of need to give support to the families, and to be able to hope and pray the outcome would be much different,' he added.

A memorial at the crash site was constructed soon after the community learned that the two had died.

What happened? The car accident that killed the couple is still under investigation

Two wooden crosses were put in the ground on the side of the road, and people stopped by to drop off flowers.

Friends of the couple remembered the two on Twitter, with pictures of the memorial site and pictures of them together.
