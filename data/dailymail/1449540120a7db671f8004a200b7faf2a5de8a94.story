England’s last World Cup warm-up match in Miami was electrifying and surprising; sadly, though, that was just the weather.

For English spectators there was something wholly unprecedented: a 44-minute break for an electrical storm, as bolts of lightning threatened crowd safety. However, there was little to match that excitement on the pitch.

In a game that was in danger of degenerating into a  brawl – four Honduras players were booked, with Brayan Beckeles sent off for his second yellow on 65 minutes as well as three cautions for England - Roy Hodgson will at least be happy to emerge from this game relatively unscathed.

England
 should have won – Daniel Sturridge missed two excellent chances in 
either half - and Danny Welbeck, Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana all 
stood out with energetic and authoritative performances which will 
surely confirm their presence in the starting eleven against Italy next 
week.

But otherwise there 
was little to commend. England were good enough, without thrilling 
anyone.

Their movement and fluidity looked a little better yet they 
still only created occasional chances in the twenty five minutes they 
played against ten men.

In short, it is time for the phoney war to come 
to an end and the real stuff to begin. No-one will condemn England on 
the basis of yesterday evening’s fare; from next weekend, though, the 
judgements will be less forgiving.

‘Honduras
 were quite physical and it was one of the most frustrating games I have
 been involved with for a long time and one that I will very, very soon 
forget,’ said Hodgson. ‘I though the tempo of our play and effort to 
score in the second half was commendable. I will take the draw and take 
the fact that we got out without any injuries.’

Frustration: Daniel Sturridge missed England's best opportunities at Sun Life Stadium

Delay: England's game against Honduras was postponed for over 40 minutes in Miami

Suspended: The players were taken off the pitch after 22 minutes due to a storm in the area

It
 was bizarre afternoon. Florida state safety regulations mean that 
sports events have to be stopped if there is any danger of lightning 
strike. So when a dramatic bolt of lightning cracked overhead of the Sun
 Life Stadium in Miami last night, referee Ricardo Salazar had seen 
enough. Exactly half way through the first half off the teams trudged; 
and off they stayed for 44 minutes until the storm had passed.

Nevertheless,
 amidst the rain, that even had the watching David Beckham scurrying for
 cover, something did emerge: England’s team to face Italy in Manaus 
next week. Of course, Raheem Sterling was never going to play here, 
after being suspended for his red card against Ecuador.  Nevertheless, 
Welbeck and Lallana, with specific tasks to track back and harry 
opposition midfielders, looks increasingly like the chosen ones for the 
World Cup kick off.

And at 
least in some respect, the preparations were perfect. The England camp 
were delighted with the 60 per cent humidity and 30 degree heat. The 
heat – ‘worse the Manaus’ said an English official happily – was truly 
excruciating. This at least would prepare England for their Amazonian 
trek next weekend.

Safety first: The delay had threatened to abandon the game, but the players returned shortly before 6pm local time

Walk and talk: England manager Roy Hodgson and captain Steven Gerrard leave the pitch

And, 
amidst the kicking match, there were moments of promise, even if 
ultimately England failed to break down ten men. Foremost was the 
fluidity of the front four – Wayne Rooney, Welbeck, Sturrdige and 
Lallana – rotating their positons regularly. Indeed, just prior to the 
unexpected break, a delightful exchange between Rooney and Welbeck down 
the right – both in areas away from their allotted positions – saw 
Rooney cross and Welbeck dummy to play in Sturridge.

The Liverpool 
striker moved his body well to get into shooting range but pulled his 
shot wide. On the bench, Hodgson grimaced in frustration; his side 
should have been ahead.

That
 was the last action for almost an hour, the sides trooping off as the 
storm closed in. When they re-emerged, Honduras looked more ready for a 
fight than a match. Tackles began flying in, Palacios earning a yellow 
card, for a chop at Gerrard.

His team-mates then joined in 
enthusiastically, Emilio Izaguirre, hacking at Sturridge’s ankles and 
then kicking the ball into him as he lay on the ground. He received a 
yellow card but it should certainly have been red.

Leap: Carlos Costly rises above Wayne Rooney to head towards goal

Alarmed,
 Hodgson withdrew Gerrard and Rooney at half time for Jack Wilshere and 
Ross Barkley but Honduras were not pacified. Victor Bernandez was booked
 for a kick at Barkley and then Brayan Beckeles had another kick at 
Welbeck on 51 minutes, for which he was also cautioned.

England 
retaliated, Lallana kickin out at Roger Espinoza’s knee on 61 minutes 
and receive a booking. Beckeles the receivd a second yellow as was 
dismissed for aiming his elbow at Leighton Baines on 66 minutes, with 
Gary Cahill and Baines earning later yellow cards.

It
 was an indecently aggressive game, given both sides have a World Cup in
 front of them. Wilshere and Barkley did at least bring fresh energy to 
the proceedings in the second half, combining to play in the Evertonian,
 when only a superb saving tackle from Izaguirre saved Honduras.

Barkley
 and Sturridge then interchanged passes to put in Lallana, whose dribble
 ran out of control. Still, Sturridge managed to connect, forcing a 
sharp save from Noel Valladares.

On the move: England winger Adam Lallana takes on Celtic's Honduran defender Izaguirre

Plenty to ponder: Hodgson refused to confirm that his starting XI in Miami will be the team against Italy

Withdrawn: Rooney was taken off at half-time in Miami, as was captain Gerrard

Away
 from the kicking match, Henderson was displaying fresh authority. He 
grows with every match and as the senior partner in midfield in the 
second half, he both directed play and his team-mates. Nevertheless, 
even against ten men, England struggled to create genuine chances.

The 
one that should have settled the match came on 72 minutes.

Glen
 Johnson had pushed on well and found Sturridge, who, seven yards out 
with just Valladares to beat, headed well over So frustrated was the 
Liverpool man, he kicked the goalpost; inadvisable one week before your 
World Cup starts.

Still, England caught their flight to Rio De Janiero 
last night with their team still in tact. For that at least they will be
 thankful. ‘it’s time for the real thing now,’ said Hodgson. Indeed it 
is.

Impact: Ross Barkley impressed once again after coming off the bench at half-time

Dismissed: Brayan Beckeles was given a second yellow card for elbowing Leighton Baines

Unsavoury: Sturridge was hit by a can of beer thrown from the crowd at Sun Life Stadium
