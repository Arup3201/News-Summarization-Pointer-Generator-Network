Futuristic cityscapes featuring soaring skyscrapers, flying cars and all-seeing video screens are popular features of sci-fi films.

And now one artist has imagined how that reality would affect Paris and New York in less than a century.

Gone are Paris’ breezy boulevards and grand open spaces and New York’s elegant Art Deco buildings. Instead grimy streets are lined by sinister 'atmosphere-scraper' buildings, while the cities' inhabitants live in cramped conditions.

Scare Bleu! One artist has imagined what Paris and New York might look like in less than 100 year¿s time. This terrifying vision of the future shows the view to the Eiffel Tower. Gone are the open gardens and boulevards by the Seine, which have been replaced by towering grey skyscrapers and complex-looking covered roads

A matter of time? In the illustrations, massive metal buildings dwarfing landmarks such as Sacre Coeur and the Eiffel Tower feature, while Times Square in New York (pictured)looks like it has fallen on hard times in the dystopian vision of the future

Enormous industrial buildings give out a cold fluorescent light, dwarfing landmarks such as Sacre Coeur and the Eiffel Tower, while Times Square looks like it has fallen on hard times in a dystopian vision of the future.

The images were dreamed up by French concept designer Paul Chadeisson, who works in the French capital for a videogame company called Dontnod Entertainment.

He has created futuristic cityscapes for the game Remember Me, as well as artwork for films and books, all of which show incredible attention to detail.

Not so triumphant: The images were dreamed up by French concept designer Paul Chadeisson who works in the French capital for a videogame company called Dontnod Entertainment. Here, the Arc de Triomphe has been turned into some sort of look-out with wires snaking over it

A time for robots: As well as huge neon signs, the cities feature flying vehicles, drones (pictured) and robots, which seem to have taken menial jobs of humans, such as sweeping the streets, and perhaps keep a watch on inhabitants

An unholy mess? While the cityscapes appear at first glance to be impressive and technologically advanced, there are few trees and rubbish strewn across roads, with wires exposed to provide electricity to ramshackle house. Here, Sacre Coeur peeps over the neglected buildings, complete with what looks like some sort of roadblock

Among the run-down buildings it is still possible to see signatures of the cities. For example, Paris retains some of its grand 17th century buildings and famous cafes. But they are largely neglected and littered with neon signs, overlooked by large metal factories, indicating the city will be more densely populated in the future.

Mr Chadeisson’s illustrations of the city are set in 2084 and he writes in a blog post that in the city, which is penned for a video game, augmented reality and memory manipulation have taken control of Parisians’ lives.

In 'Neo Paris', ‘you can now digitise, buy, sell or trade you own personal memories. The last remainders of intimacy have been swept away, in what appears to be a simple extension of the development of social networks and geolocation at the beginning of the 21st century’ he says.

Past grandeur: Among the run-down buildings it is still possible to see signatures of cities. For example, Paris retains some of its grand 17th century buildings (pictured) and famous cafes

Coffee to go: Landmarks and cafes are largely neglected (pictured) and littered with neon signs, overlooked by large metal skyscrapers, indicating that Paris will be more densely populated in the future, according to the artist's futuristic vision

Mr Chadeisson describes his vision of Neo Paris in 2084. He says that 'the surveillance society has been accepted by the citizens themselves in exchange for a few technological benefits. It is a reality that no-one thinks of challenging anymore.' Here, a futuristic flying vehicle and droid can be seen, as well as the Eiffel Tower in the background

This is perhaps reflected in the faceless skyscrapers with countless tiny windows that eclipse individual landmarks such as the once bohemian Montmartre and the Pantheon.

As well as huge neon signs, the cities feature flying vehicles, drones and robots, which seem to have taken the menial jobs of humans and perhaps keep a watch on inhabitants. IN one image, an alluring looking female droid looks down to a street below her.

Vast prisons and giant airships or modes of transport paint a foreboding vision of the future.

Cities in the sky: Vast prisons and giant airships or modes of transport paint a foreboding vision of the future. Here, a massive ship hovers foreboding above the clouds. Complete with frees and buildings, it is almost like a miniature city

High rise future: This image is of no specific city but crystallises the artist's view that future urban spaces will be largely grey and as well as high rise in nature

A glimpse of the past: The faceless skyscrapers with countless tiny windows eclipse individual landmarks such as the once bohemian Montmartre and the Pantheon (pictured) while grand old builds have been 'upgraded' with metal add-ons and wires

While the cityscapes appear at first glance to be impressive and technologically advanced, there are few trees and rubbish strewn across roads, with wires exposed to provide electricity to ramshackle houses.

This is in stark contrast to smart buildings being designed today, which boast a plethora of environmental features, from artificial leaves and filters to make skyscrapers cleaner as well as wind turbines and solar panels, to pretty kaleidoscope features and expanses of glass to make life more pleasant for the people inside them.

Smart cities? Mr Chadeisson's illustrations of the city are set in 2084 and he writes in a blog post that in the city, augmented reality and memory manipulation have taken control of Parisians' lives. His drawings also feature details such as the inside of a factory (pictured)

More like Star Wars: This image closely resembles many cities of the future seen in sci-fi films, where incredibly tall buildings peek above the clouds and the world below is almost invisible
