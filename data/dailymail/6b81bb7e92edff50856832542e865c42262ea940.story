Snoopy, an exotic short-hair cat, is already a huge hit in his native China and this year has taken the rest of the world by storm.

He already has more than 275,000 followers on Weibo - China's version of Twitter - and a further 190,000 on Instagram.

The two-year-old even has his own Facebook page where hundreds regularly see the dozens of photographs uploaded of him every month.

The growth in Snoopy's popularity will be seen as a threat to established feline internet stars Maru and Grumpy Cat Tardar Sauce.

Japanese cat Maru has previously been hailed the internet's most famous feline and videos of her antics have been viewed millions of times.

Grumpy Cat is so popular she was chosen as 'spokescat' for a Friskies brand of cat food, it was announced this month.

The frown-faced internet sensation is among the biggest stars of the peculiar trend of cat dominance on web videos and postings.

However, Snoopybabe's fan base is growing rapidly.

The adorable short-hair, based in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, is famous for his short snout, flat face and enormous brown eyes.

Snoopybabe's owner Miss Ning said the cat's best asset is his 'pie face'.

She told Chinese website, A Pet Guide, that his droopy eyes make him appear innocent all the time.

Miss Ning said his distinctive look comes from his parents, one an American short-hair and the other a Persian cat.

However she says she has been surprised by the reaction to photographs of her pet and admits she 'did not expect a lot of people' to comment or forward it on.
