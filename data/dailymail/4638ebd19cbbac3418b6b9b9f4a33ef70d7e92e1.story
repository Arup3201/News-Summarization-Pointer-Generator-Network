GCSE grades should be scrapped and replaced with points scores, according to the influential organisation that operates Cambridge University’s three exam boards.

The current system needs to be replaced because it creates ‘arbitrary’ categories that conceal the true level of a pupil’s achievement, said Cambridge Assessment.

Candidates can have quite different marks but end up with the same grade, while others with similar marks are awarded different grades.

International Examinations and Cambridge English Language Assessment, said the system should be based on a numerical scale.

It ruled out using a ‘narrow’ system based on a percentage in favour of a more accurate scale which ‘could range from 600 to 900 points’.

‘Grades are arbitrary categories imposed on an underlying continuum of achievement,’ said Tim Oates, director of assessment research and development.

‘Scale scores... could reduce some of the undesirable effects in schools of extra effort being concentrated on pupils around the grade C boundary. This would lead to better teaching and learning.’

The Campaign for Real Education welcomed the proposal yesterday but had reservations about an ‘over-complex’ system that parents and employers would struggle to understand.

Chairman Chris McGovern said: ‘Their instincts are correct but we need a simple score like a percentage that is precise but simple enough for everyone to understand.’

However, education expert Professor Alan Smithers, from the University of Buckingham, warned exact scores were meaningless as exams are not a precise form of measuring academic ability.

He added: ‘The other reason [to keep grades] is everybody is used to As, Bs and Cs, so there is no real point in changing the currency unless there is a compelling reason to do so.’

The Cambridge Assessment proposal involves adding up marks from each paper in a GCSE subject and converting them into a points score.

To understand the final score, examples could be provided of the types of questions pupils are able to answer, based on their performance.

Alternatively, the scores could be compared to the grade system it had replaced, the report said.

But Mr McGovern said: ‘If you try linking it with the previous exam you muddy the waters.

‘We need a clean break from the current GCSEs which are discredited because of grade inflation.’ A spokesman for exam regulator Ofqual said: ‘We will be consulting soon on proposals for the regulatory arrangements for the new GCSEs and this will include considerations of how they should be graded.

‘We welcome all contributions to the debates of these important aspects of the qualifications.’ A spokesman for the AQA exam board said: ‘This is an important debate.

At a time of major changes to qualifications it is right that we consider how best to present the results of students’ hard work so that they can be understood and used in the wider world.’
