Police in Florida launched a frantic missing person's search on Sunday evening - only to discover the whole episode was the result of a drunken misunderstanding.

St Cloud Police began a search on Sunday for a woman seen on surveillance footage being dragged out of an emergency room by a man.

The woman appeared to be in distress after walking into the emergency room for help before being pulled out by her arm and put in a Saturn SUV, which sped away from the St. Cloud Regional Medical Center.
