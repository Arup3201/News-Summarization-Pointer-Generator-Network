A 22-year-old mother has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly stuffing a sock in her three-month-old son's mouth and leaving him face down in a closet.

Sasha Hunt, of Berne, Indiana, was arrested yesterday after allegedly using duct tape to keep the sock in place, while trying to kill him.

The mother, who suffers from bipolar disorder, also bound the baby's arms to stop him from pulling out the gag in the hope he would suffocate to death.

Police said Hunt placed her son face down on a pillow and locked him in a closet to die.

The baby only survived because his father, Nathan Hunt, heard muffled cries coming from a bedroom when he returned to the family home after popping out for 15 minutes.

Fearing his newborn son had rolled on his front, he rushed up to the bedroom but was unable to find the baby in his crib.

His wife followed him into the room and allegedly told him to stop.

He heard sounds from a closet in his one-year-old daughter's room and found the infant inside face down on the floor, wrapped in a blue blanket with his arms wrapped next to his body.

Nathan told police he immediately took the tape off of the baby's face and took the sock out of his mouth.

Sasha told her husband, 'that's not me'. She also said that what she had done had scared her and that she just lost control.

Police said after making sure his son was safe he told his wife she had the choice of seeking hospital treatment or he was going to turn her into the police.

She checked into Adams Memorial Hospital on October 13.

Hunt told investigators that prior to the incident, his wife had kicked holes in walls, attacked him physically and frequently handled their child in a rough manner.

He said she suffered from bipolar disorder and is currently under a doctor's care and taking medication for the disorder.

The child was also found with bruises recently, which Sasha blamed on the couple's one-year-old daughter.

On another occasion, Sasha reportedly told her husband that she wished the baby had never been born and hoped that he would die.

Sasha Hunt was booked into jail and charged with attempted murder and neglect of a dependent.
