In the latest string of shocking sex assault allegations in the military, eight female Marines stationed at one of the country’s most prestigious bases filed a lawsuit today claiming U.S. military officers tolerate a ‘staggering’ level of sexual assaults.

Lt Ariana Klay and Lt Elle Helmer both claim they were raped at the U.S. Marine Barracks in Washington D.C., one of the most prestigious bases in the country.

They said that in addition to being raped with little or no justice following the alleged incidents, their fellow Marines ridiculed them for being ‘sluts’ and ‘walking mattresses.’

No justice: Lt Elle Helmer, left, and Lt Ariana Klay, right, both claim they were raped in the Washington, D.C. barracks, and were later mocked by fellow Marines, who called them 'sluts'

Prestigious: The Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. are regarded as one of the best in the nation

Death threat: Lt Klay alleged that the men threatened to kill her, then began raping her. The lawsuit accuses the military of a having a 'high tolerance for sexual predators in their ranks'

One of the plaintiffs in the case is Lt Ariana Klay, who graduated with honours from the U.S. Naval Academy, joined the Marine Corps, and went on to serve in Iraq, claims that her rapists threatened to kill her and said they wanted to humiliate her.

The lawsuit claims that once Lt Klay began serving at the Marine Barracks in Washington, she encountered an atmosphere of ‘harassment and abuse that culminated in Lt Klay being gang-raped at her private residence one block away from the base’ in August 2010.

The document alleges that several senior officers made verbal sexual advances toward her, and the sexual assault culminated when her civilian boss and her commanding officer allegedly entered her residence.

Lt Klay told the Today show: ‘They threatened me with death and raped me.’

She added: ‘(My commanding officer) said that I had humiliated him in front of his junior Marines and he wanted to humiliate me back.’ 

Elle Helmer, who was the former Barracks public information officer and a lieutenant, said she was also raped by a superior officer back in March 2006, the Today show reported.

Lt Helmer told the Today show that a Marine Barracks officer ‘grabbed my shoulder and pushed me against the wall and tried to kiss me.’

Mocked: The lawsuit alleges that aside from their rapists facing no charges, the female Marines faced ridicule from their peers, who called them 'walking mattresses' and 'sluts'

Farce: One Marine in charge of filing complains posted a supposedly-satirical 'Hurt Feelings Report' to their Facebook page, with reasons for filing including 'I am a cry baby' and 'I want my mommy'

Service: Lt Klay, who graduated with honours from the U.S. Naval Academy, joined the Marine Corps, and went on to serve in Iraq, claims that her rapists threatened to kill her and said they wanted to humiliate her

When she tried to flee, she said the officer ‘slammed the door on my arm and pulled me back in.’ After that moment, Lt Helmer said she lost consciousness, but is sure of what happened.

‘I have zero doubt that my company commander raped me the night of March 16,’ she said.

However, officials at the Marine Barracks said the allegations were ‘thoroughly investigated’ and found to be uncorroborated, the Today show said.

The
Department of Defence estimates that more than 19,000 military men and 
women were sexually assaulted by fellow troops in 2010 alone while 
serving in the U.S. armed forces.

At
least 20 per cent of servicewomen and one per cent of men - an 
estimated 500,000 troops - have experienced sexual trauma while serving.

In most cases, a rape
victim’s only judicial recourse is to report the attack to his or her 
commander, even if it was the officer who attacked them, and it is the 
officer’s decision whether or not to investigate and prosecute.

The lawsuit says that the men in question were in no way punished. Beyond that, he was featured on a nationally televised recruitment commercial while under investigation.

However, after Lt Klay reported the rapes, the Marine Corps said she must have welcomed the assaults because she wore make up and skirts – which were part of her regulated uniform – and exercised in running shorts, the lawsuit claims.

Lt Helmer was recruited from The Basic School to server as Public Affairs Officer at the barracks.

In a statement, she said that a photograph of her was required as part of the application, and that she was selected because the Marine Barracks wanted an attractive female to serve as a ‘poster child.’

She alleges that after a mandatory night of drinking with fellow officers, a Marine Major attempted to kiss her back at the Barracks. Lt Helmer resisted, and awoke the next morning in his office, wearing his shorts.

Despite reporting to a senior officer that she had been raped, the lawsuit alleges that little was done immediately after to investigate. NCIS conducted a short investigation with inconclusive results, and the Marine Corps ‘lost’ her rape kit.

The lawsuit is the latest in an alarming number of sexual assault allegations and estimation by secretary of Defence Leon Panetta that more than 19,000 assaults annually occur within the ranks.

The lawsuit also brings forward a ‘Hurt Feelings report’ posted by a female officer in charge of Marine barracks protocol. 

The report, intended to be satirical, brutally mocks those making the complaints, with some reasons for filing the report being ‘I am a little b*tch,’ ‘I am a cry baby,’ and ‘I want my mommy,’ the Today show said.

Lt Klay and Lt Helmer first spoke publically about their stories in The Invisible War, a documentary slated to be released this spring that looks into the alarming amount of sexual assaults and rapes within ranks.
