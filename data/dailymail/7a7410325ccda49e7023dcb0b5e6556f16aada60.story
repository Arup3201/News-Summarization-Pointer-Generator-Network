Senior Tories rallied round Theresa May last night after she revealed she has been diagnosed with a form of diabetes that will require daily injections for the rest of her life.

The Home Secretary said it had been ‘a real shock’ when she was told last November that she had Type 1 diabetes, which carries an increased risk of heart attack and strokes.

Tory colleagues praised her courage for speaking out on the issue, and said it would make no difference to her work – or her rumoured ambition to stand for the Tory leadership one day.

Former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft said the illness ‘will not hold her back’ and revealed that he is also a sufferer.

In the message on Twitter he said: ‘Diabetes will not hold Theresa May back. It didn’t for me and shouldn’t for her. I remain a fan.’

Mrs May, 56, said she had spoken out following speculation about her rapid weight loss in recent months – which some observers had claimed was the start of a makeover campaign to prepare for a possible future leadership bid.

In February this year the Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, tweeted: ‘A bit worried about Home Secretary. She is looking a bit thin these days. A new diet or pressure of work?’

In an interview with the Mail on Sunday yesterday Mrs May admitted she ‘wasn’t best pleased’ with Mr Vaz’s ‘unfortunate’ intervention. She added: ‘I thought it actually rebounded on him rather than anything to do with me.

‘I thought it was unfortunate that he 
felt he wanted to make those sorts of comments. He does have diabetes, 
he’s mentioned it in Parliament, so I will be interested to see what the
 next thing he chooses to say will be.’

The Home Secretary’s illness could mean the end of the most famous heels at Westminster.

Mrs May is renowned for her love of shoes – particularly of  all things leopard print – and her often-daring outfits are always smartly accessorised by killer heels.

But diabetes causes high blood sugar levels which encourage bacteria, so that any minor cut or blister can quickly become infected and develop into an ulcer – and the feet are particularly vulnerable.

Some doctors advise patients not to wear overly high heels or pointed shoes as this puts undue pressure on the feet.

Instead they are encouraged to wear comfortable shoes preferably with cotton socks to help cushion the impact.

But Mrs May is adamant her signature sling-backs will not get the boot.

She told the Mail on Sunday: ‘I have to say the advice [doctors] give on shoes does not necessarily include kitten heels. I’ve not been banned from wearing them.’

Her love of footwear emerged at the Tory conference in Bournemouth in 2002 when her £110 Russell & Bromley ponyskin kitten heels caused a sensation.

But one pair shouldn’t cause too much of a problem – the leopard print wellies she wore to the conference in 2009.

Mrs
 May explained that she embarked on her diet and fitness regime before 
discovering she had diabetes, which can also cause weight loss. She has 
lost almost two stone in the last 18 months, shrinking down to between a
 size ten and a 12.

The 
Home Secretary, the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed David Cameron as 
Tory leader, was initially told she had Type 2 diabetes, like 90 per 
cent of all three million adults in the UK with diabetes.

However further tests revealed it was
 actually Type 1, which is more usually diagnosed in teenagers and which
 leaves patients with a greater risk of strokes and heart disease.

The revelation comes at a time when Mrs May’s popularity within the Tory parliamentary party is at a high, following the successful deportation of hate preacher Abu Qatada and the first signs of success in bringing down immigration.

But she put paid to rumours that her weight loss was a sign of a planned leadership bid. ‘This was not some great Machiavellian plan, because there is no leadership bid,’ she said.

‘We have a first-class leader and a first-class Prime Minister and long may he continue.’

Tory MPs yesterday said the illness would make no difference to Mrs May’s ambitions.

Mark Reckless, a member of the home affairs committee, said: ‘There is no reason why it should get in the way of the great job she is doing. It is good that she is being open about it as it will help raise awareness.’

Fellow Tory Glyn Davies said: ‘It must be a shock and it will have to be managed. My message would be – now carry on being a top Home Secretary.’

Mrs May also insisted the illness, which requires her to administer twice-daily injections to herself, would not affect her ability to carry out her gruelling workload.

‘The diabetes doesn’t affect how I do the job or what I do,’ she said. ‘It’s just part of life, so it’s head down and get on with it.’

She went on: ‘It was a real shock and, yes, it took me a while to come to terms with it. I’m a little more careful about what I eat. And there’s obviously the injections, but this is something millions of people have. I’m OK with needles, fortunately.

‘There’s a great quote from Steve Redgrave who was diagnosed with diabetes before he won his last Olympic gold medal. He said diabetes must learn to live with me rather than me live with diabetes. That’s the attitude.’
