A teenager who lost his leg to cancer
and fell carrying the Olympic torch is tipped to become a Paralympian after being inspired to 
take up gymnastics by the heroes of London 2012.

Kieran Maxwell, 14, is halfway to raising the £25,000 he needs for a new prosthetic limb that he hopes will take him to Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and 'win gold for Britain'.

His bravery as he fell during the 
June torch relay through his home town of Bishop Auckland, County 
Durham, led to the UK's biggest-ever lottery jackpot winners Colin 
and Chris Weir buying him a new lighter limb for everyday use.

The 14-year-old from Bishop Auckland has become an accomplished acrobatic gymnast - a sport which is being considered for Olympic status and he is aiming to win the national championships in 2013

Kieran said: 'Before I lost my leg I couldn't even do a forward roll but now I can do them easily, as well as hand-stands and cartwheels. I'm now working on learning somersaults'

But now the teenager – who is in 
remission - is raising money to buy another one specially designed so 
he can pursue his Paralympic dream.

The 14-year-old from the village of Heighington, has become an accomplished acrobatic gymnast - a sport which is being considered for Olympic status and he is aiming to win the national championships in 2013.

'I love everything about it. It makes me feel like I'm not different from other people. I'm not,' he said.

'Before
I lost my leg I couldn't even do a forward roll but now I can do them easily, 
as well as hand-stands and cartwheels. I'm now working on learning somersaults.

'My aim is that I would like to be a Paralympian, hopefully in Rio, and go on to win gold for Britain.

'I
went to the Paralympics in the Olympic stadium. It was so 
inspiring. It made me think that these people go out there and do what 
they love and have gone through the same thing as me. I know that I can 
do it too.'

Despite undergoing gruelling chemotherapy Kieran had his left leg amputated below the knee in March last year

The irony is that Kieran only took up
the sport to build strength so he could carry the torch easily, but he 
still fell over because it was so difficult to walk in his NHS leg - 
designed for someone weighing 60kg when he only weighed 30kg.

Speaking to MailOnline about what happened that day he said: 'The torch was dented! But I have been able to keep it.

'My first reaction was I was worried people might laugh. But they didn't - they started really cheering me on.

'My mum ran over and shouted "are you alright Kieran?" and tried to pick me up. I just said "get off me mum, I want to do this and I want to keep going".'

His mother Nicola said: 'I couldn't be more proud of him. He has had to make decision as a child (about his leg being amputated) that no child should have to make. He is such a special boy'

His mother Nicola, 34, spoke emotionally about how she felt when he fell.

'I was so worried they would take the mickey. But the support he got was incredible,' she said.

'The aim was to buy him a leg for when he was 18 - when he had stopped growing - because they are so expensive.

'I ran over and tried to pick him up but he wanted to do it himself with a smile on his face. That's Kieran. He just gets on with it.

'When he fell I thought I cannot make him suffer and we would do what we could to raise money for a leg.

'I couldn't be more proud of him. He has had to make decision as a child (about his leg being amputated) that no child should have to make. He is such a special boy.'

Heartbreaking: Kieran's bravery was clear for 
all to see when he fell while holding the Olympic torch because of his 
current artificial limb. He got up and dusted himself off in yet another
incredible show of strength

Happy: EuroMillions lottery winners Chris Weir and her husband Colin Weir say it was a privilege to spend a little of their £161m on Kieran

Generous Euromillions winners the Weirs, who picked up £161million in 2011, saw what happened and then stepped in and paid a five-figure sum for a new lightweight leg, and said it was a 'privilege' to do it.

The
unexpected donation came after the grandmother of Kieran’s school 
friend, who lives in the same village as the Weirs, contacted them to 
ask if they could help.

Kieran
'screamed with delight' at the life-changing news and his new leg 
allows him to do many of the things his friends can especially playing 
the sports he loves like football.

'It is amazing what they did. And the best thing is that nobody can tell he is an amptutee. He looks and walks like a normal boy', Mrs Maxwell said. ' The old leg was so difficult for him'.

'They are 
good people. We haven't met them but they have done a wonderful thing 
for Kieran and will always be grateful. I know they have set up a foundation for good causes and are doing very good things.'

Hero: His mother and family are incredibly proud of the happy teenager who lost a leg to cancer but has rebuilt his life

Despite undergoing gruelling chemotherapy Kieran had his left leg amputated below the knee in March last year.

He
was diagnosed with the rare and aggressive cancer called Ewings 
Sarcoma, which affects around than 30 children a year, in October 2010.

Mother Nicola said: 'He had a pain in his leg and we all thought it was growing pains. The doctor agreed and he took paracetamol.

'But
one day he just came in and his leg had swollen. We went to the GP and 
it just got worse. Within two days we had found out he had cancer.

I remember asking 'does my son have cancer' and they said yes but didn't know what kind

'He
is one of the lucky ones. It hits 30 children a year and the majority 
die. It grows through the bones but luckily for Kieran it it came out.

'Apart from a slight ache he had no real symptoms, no weight loss and and was eating well. It is rare and not enough people know about.'

A new website has been launched to help raise money.

Website desiner Alienation Digital was informed of the situation through managing director, Neil Barr’s nephew, who attends the same school as Kieran.

They then contacted his parents and requested permission to develop a digital strategy and a new user-friendly and bold website to help help raise funds and awareness for the Kieran Maxwell Fund,
