Dressed in a green surgical gown and 
cap, British restaurateur Rekha Patel cradled her newborn daughter at 
the Akanksha clinic in northwestern India as her husband Daniel smiled 
warmly, peering in through a glass door.

‘I can't believe we have our own child at last,’ said Patel, 42, gazing in wonderment at five-day-old Gabrielle.

‘We
are really grateful to our surrogate mother who managed to get pregnant
and kept our little daughter healthy. She gave nine months of her life 
to give us a child.’

It
is the perfect promotion for India's booming surrogacy industry that 
sees thousands of infertile couples, many from overseas, hiring the 
wombs of local women to carry their embryos through to birth.

But
a debate over whether the unregulated industry exploits poor women 
prompted authorities to draft a law that could make it tougher for 
foreigners seeking babies made in India.

‘There
is a need to regulate the sector,’ said Dr. Sudhir Ajja of Surrogacy 
India, a Mumbai-based fertility bank that has produced 295 surrogate 
babies - 90 percent for overseas clients and 40 percent for same-sex 
couples - since it opened in 2007.

‘But
if the new law tightens rules as suggested by the ministry of home 
affairs, which disallows surrogacy for same-sex couples and single 
parents, then it will clearly impact the industry and put off clients 
coming from overseas.’

India
opened up to commercial surrogacy in 2002. It is among just a handful 
of countries - including Georgia, Russia, Thailand and Ukraine - and a 
few U.S. states where women can be paid to carry another's genetic child
through a process of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and embryo transfer.

The
low-cost technology, skilled doctors, scant bureaucracy and a plentiful
supply of surrogates have made India a preferred destination for 
fertility tourism, attracting nationals from Britain, the United States,
Australia and Japan, to name a few.

There
are no official figures on how large the fertility industry is in 
India. A U.N.-backed study in July 2012 estimated the surrogacy business
at more than $400 million a year (£250 million), with over 3,000 fertility clinics 
across India.

The
Akanksha clinic in Anand is the best-known at home and abroad, giving 
the small town in Gujarat state the reputation as India's ‘surrogacy 
capital’.

‘The
surrogates in Anand have become empowered through giving this beautiful
gift to others,’ says Akanksha's owner, IVF specialist Nayana Patel, 
who shot to fame in 2004 after she helped a patient have a baby by using
the woman's mother - the child's grandmother - as a surrogate.

‘With
the money, they are able to buy a house, educate their children and 
even start a small business. These are things they could only dream of 
before. It's a win-win situation.’

Patel,
who appeared on U.S. celebrity Oprah Winfrey's talk show in 2007, has 
produced more than 500 surrogate babies - two-thirds of them for 
foreigners and people of Indian origin living in over 30 countries.

Charging
couples like Rekha and Daniel an average of $25,000 to $30,000, a 
fraction of the cost in the United States, Patel pays her surrogates 
around 400,000 rupees (£4,000 or $6,500).

For
33-year-old Naina Patel, who gave birth to Gabrielle, the compensation 
outweighs the downside. The wife of an auto-rickshaw driver with three 
daughters of her own, she had to live in a hostel for nine months with 
60 other surrogates so the clinic could monitor her health.

India's surrogacy industry is vilified by women's rights groups

Like most surrogates, she kept her pregnancy a secret due to the social stigma in India's conservative society.

‘I
was happy to do it but it was not really out of choice because we 
needed the money,’ she said in a hospital bed as she recovered from the 
Caesarean operation for Gabrielle's birth.

India's
surrogacy industry is vilified by women's rights groups who say 
fertility clinics are nothing more than ‘baby factories’ for the rich. 
In the absence of regulation, they say many poor and uneducated women 
are lured by agents, hired by clinics, into signing contracts they do 
not fully understand.

In
May last year, surrogate mother Premila Vaghela, 30, died days after 
delivering a child for an American couple at a clinic in Gujarat. It was
recorded as an ‘accidental death’ by police.

A
recent government-funded study of 100 surrogate mothers in Delhi and 
Mumbai found there was ‘no fixed rule’ related to compensation and no 
insurance for post-delivery healthcare. It cited cases where surrogates 
were implanted with embryos multiple times to raise the chances of 
success.

‘In
most of these cases, the surrogate mothers are being exploited,’ said 
Ranjana Kumari, director of the Centre for Social Research that 
conducted the study.

Moves
to introduce a law - the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Bill (ART) -
to protect surrogates, the children and the commissioning parents is 
long overdue, Kumari said.

Revised
visa requirements introduced in July have already resulted in foreign 
same-sex couples and individuals being prohibited from surrogacy in 
India. The ART bill, expected to come before parliament next year, will 
tighten things further.

Under
the current draft, all fertility clinics must be registered and 
monitored by a regulatory authority. Surrogates must be between 21 and 
35 years old, they will be provided with insurance and notarised 
contracts must be signed between the women and the commissioning 
parents.

‘Legislation
should be there so that this wonderful procedure can be supervised and 
it is being done by the right people for the right people,’ said 
Akanksha's Patel.

‘But
more bureaucracy will make it difficult for everyone. It will not only 
mean less commissioning parents from overseas but it will also impact 
surrogates, who will lose out on the only chance they have to change 
their lives for the better.’
