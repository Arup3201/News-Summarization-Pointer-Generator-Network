A potentially dangerous wave of food fraud affecting everything from olive oil to tuna, spices and pomegranate juice has been exposed.

Extra virgin olive oil is being diluted with cheaper vegetable oil, while tea bags might be bulked up with lawn grass or fern leaves, according to US researchers.

Apparently healthy white tuna on a menu may actually be the less-expensive escolar, a fish that has been banned in many countries because of its links to food poisoning.

Food fraud: Some manufacturers are selling cheap escolar - a fish that has been linked to a type of food poisoning - masquerading as tuna, a report warns

There is evidence from America that 
manufacturers are secretly adding cheap pear and grape juice to 
pomegranate, which is highly sought after as a health drink.

While spices such as black pepper, 
paprika and saffron may be bulked up with other plant material and 
coloured with industrial, and potentially dangerous, dyes.

The warnings come from the US 
Pharmacopeial(correct) Convention, an independent scientific body which 
sets quality standards for food and medicine.

The organisation says many foods 
contain ingredients which consumers would not expect to have bought - 
akin to the recent scandal in Britain involving horse meat being found 
in beef burgers.

According to the report, called the Food Fraud Database, many of the added substances are less expensive and some are harmful.

The situation mirrors warnings from 
British trading standards chiefs who say the current economic climate 
means manufacturers, retailers and restaurants may be more inclined to 
cut corners.

British experts have found that honey,
 cheese, eggs, organic meat and produce, Basmati rice, even fish and 
chips are not necessarily what they seem.

Just before Christmas one British firm
 was fined more than £20,000 for passing off a cheap pesto sauce as 
something far more gourmet.

Stark Naked Foods claimed its pesto 
was made with extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese, when in 
fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper Latvian cheese.

At the same time, pubs and restaurants
 are not immune to boasting of offering local quality food, when this 
actually means the nearest supermarket or wholesaler.

One estimate suggests British families
 are wasting as much as £7billion a year paying over the odds for food 
that has been faked in some way.

There are cases of imported beef from 
Zebu cattle, which have a distinctive hump on their neck, being imported
 from south America and sold in pubs as ‘British’.

Meat from cross-breed cattle 
containing Zebu genes from Brazil is cheaper than British beef, however 
critics point out that it can also be much tougher.

Vast quantities of cheap honey is 
being imported into Europe from China and used to bulk up other types in
 a scam that has become known as ‘honey-laundering’.

In some cases honey is not honey at all, but rather corn syrup or just sugar.

Butcher shops and leading restaurants 
have been found selling conventional meat and produce as organic, along 
with a premium price.

In the past, even Harrods has been found selling farmed salmon as wild.

But the fakery does not stop at 
salmon, for some fish and chip shops have been prosecuted for passing 
off Shark Catfish, which is farmed in the rivers of Vietnam’s Mekong 
delta, as battered cod.

The fish sells for less than half the 
price of real cod in wholesale markets, however chip shop customers are 
being charged as if it is the real thing.

Director of policy at the Trading 
Standards Institute, Andy Foster, warned that a squeeze on spending 
means his members find it increasingly difficult to stem the problem.

Mr Foster said: ‘Wherever there is a few pounds to be made someone will try to exploit it.

‘In times of recession, when people 
are looking for a bargain and going to different places, that is where 
you start to find more fraud introduced to food.’
