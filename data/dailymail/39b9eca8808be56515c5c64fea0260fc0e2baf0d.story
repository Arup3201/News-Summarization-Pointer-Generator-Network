A man accused of plotting to open fire inside a Missouri movie theater during a Twilight premiere was arrested in 2009 after following a Walmart clerk with a knife and rubber Halloween mask, according to an arrest report released Tuesday.

Blaec Lammers told investigators he went to the Walmart in Bolivar in October 2009 looking for an ‘easy victim’ after watching the horror film Halloween, saying that watching the main character, Michael Myers, killing people ‘got him to thinking,’ the arrest report said.

Lammers told authorities he watched the clerk for more than two hours. He said he was planning to follow the electronics department clerk into a storage room and kill him when he heard his name over the public address system and his father calling his name, according to the report.

No charges were filed in that case. 
Instead, Lammers, who was 17 at the time, was committed for 96 hours for
a mental health examination, Polk County prosecutor Ken Ashlock said 
Tuesday.

Ashlock, who was not the county's prosecutor in 2009, said he didn't know what happened after the commitment.

Lammers, now 20, made his first court
appearance Tuesday in the movie theater case and was ordered to undergo
a mental health exam. Lammers, who is being held on a $500,000 bond, is
charged with first-degree assault, making a terroristic threat and 
armed criminal action.

His public defender, DeWayne Franklin Perry, declined comment Tuesday.

His mother, who contacted police last
week out of concern her son was planning a shooting, said Tuesday that 
he has shown signs of Asperger's syndrome, borderline personality 
disorder and other conditions. She said her son has had inpatient 
treatment in the past.

‘He didn't ask to be born different. 
He grew up his whole life in (his sister) Kristyn's shadow. He wanted to
be successful and be somebody,’ Tricia Lammers said during a news 
conference at the National Alliance for Mental Illness in Springfield, 
KLOR-TV reported.

‘Just two weeks ago he asked me - 
both my kids still call me mommy - he said, `Mommy, do you think I'm a 
failure?’ I said, “No Blaec, I don't.”’

Her son was arrested last week after 
she told police she was concerned he ‘may have intentions of shooting 
people’ during the opening weekend of the last instalment in the popular
vampire movie franchise.

According to a police probable cause 
statement, she said she believed her son had amassed weapons similar to 
those used by the gunman who attacked a theater in Aurora, Colorado, 
during the latest Batman movie in July. That attack killed 12 people.

Investigators later determined Lammers had recently purchased two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition.

Lammers' parents also tipped off 
authorities about the previous Walmart incident. The 2009 police report 
said Lammers' mother called authorities after finding a suicide note 
from her son and a missing kitchen knife.

An officer was en route when the 
mother said her son's vehicle had been found in the parking lot of the 
Walmart store in Bolivar, a town about 130 miles southeast of Kansas 
City.

The parents said in 2009 that Lammers
had been diagnosed with depression, and his mother said Lammers had an 
appointment that day with his psychologist and ‘he has been acting 
different since then.’

According to a probable cause 
statement in the movie theater case, Lammers was questioned Thursday 
afternoon and told authorities he bought tickets to a Sunday Twilight 
screening in Bolivar and planned to shoot people inside.

Lammers also said he planned to ‘just
start shooting people at random’ at the Walmart store less than a mile 
away, so if he ran out of bullets, he could ‘just break the glass where 
the ammunition is being stored and get some more and keep shooting until
police arrived,’ investigators wrote.

The probable cause statement said 
Lammers was ‘off of his medication,’ but his mother said Tuesday that to
her knowledge, that wasn't true.

The 20-year-old admitted to police 
that he was inspired by a number of well-publicized mass shootings, such
as James Holmes' attack on a theater showing The Dark Knight Rises in 
Aurora, Colorado in July.

Lammers was reported to police by his mother, according to the Springfield News-Leader, after she became concerned when he bought two guns despite never having been shooting before.

'Quiet': The suspect described himself as a 'loner' and admitted he had had 'homicidal thoughts'

She said they reminded her of the 
weapons used in the Aurora shooting, in which 12 audience members were 
killed, and feared her son might be planning a similar atrocity.

He
voluntarily attended an interview with Bolivar police, and initially 
claimed that he had bought the guns in order to go hunting.

But
when officers brought up well-known gun massacres, Lammers 'stated that
he had a lot in common with the people that have been involved in those
shootings', according to a police report.

Lammers then confessed he had bought two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition with the intention of shooting movie-goers at the Twilight screening on Sunday, to which he had already bought a ticket.

He visited a nearby town earlier this week to practice shooting at a range.

The suspect also said he was thinking about going to the local branch of Walmart to 'just start shooting people at random', so that he would have access to extra ammunition if he ran out of bullets.

On Friday morning, Lammers was charged with first-degree assault, making a terrorist threat and armed criminal action, according to court documents.

Death: Lammers had bought a ticket to the new Twilight film where he planned to launch his massacre

Inspiration: Lammers planned to imitate James Holmes, who killed 12 movie-goers in Aurora, Colorado

'Thankfully we had a responsible family member or we might have had a different outcome,' Bolivar police chief Steve Hamilton said. He said Lammers is under a doctor's care for mental illness, and court documents said he was 'off of his medication.'

Mr Hamilton said it appeared that Lammers obtained the firearms legally but that police were continuing to investigate 'to determine how in fact he was able to obtain a permit.'

Ashley Miller, who lives in a nearby town, said she has known Lammers for about a year and described him as 'one of the sweetest guys I had ever met' but 'very emotional,' noting he would periodically stop talking to her.

She said he told her that he had bounced between relatives growing up. As an adult, he bounced between girlfriends, she said.

'He was never actually happy,' she added. 'I think he had depression or something.'
