This is the moment British gap year student Henry Miller introduces himself at a tribal ceremony where he took the hallucinogenic drink that cost him his life.

Henry,
 19, from Bristol, took yagé – which induces vivid hallucinations – while taking part in a tribal ritual in remote rainforest for the second time in two days.

Moments before, he was filmed telling other tourists: 'I'm from England, my name's Henry. 

Moments before: Bristol-born Henry Miller, 19, is captured telling a fellow participant he doesn't know what to expect from his second taste of yagé, a hallucinogenic drug used in a Colombian tribal ritual

Ritual: The amateur footage shows Colombian tribesman playing instruments in front of a fire

'This is my second ceremony. After yesterday I don’t know what to expect.

'I didn’t feel many effects yesterday from the yagé and I’ve heard that can happen in the first ceremony.'

The footage, first broadcast by Colombian TV channel Caracol, has been heavily dubbed into Spanish.

Tribesmen are also filmed playing instruments and stirring a substance in front of a fire.

Tributes: Henry's parents and brother released a statement describing him as an 'adventurous person' who was 'polite, popular with a great sense of humour and was very much loved by his family and friends'

Hours after this video was taken by a 
fellow participant at the ceremony last Tuesday, Henry's body was found 
on a nearby dirt track.

Ricardo Suarez, the Putumayo police commander, said evidence suggests the shaman sent Henry to a hospital on a motorcycle with two young local men, but he died en route.

‘I’m from England, my name’s Henry.  

‘This is my second ceremony.

‘After yesterday I don’t know what to expect.

‘I didn’t feel many effects yesterday from the yagé and I’ve heard that can happen in the first ceremony.’

'Everything indicates that the two young men panicked and left him on the side of the road,' Mr Suarez said.

Three
 people including a shaman who prepared the drink, made from local plant
 infusions, and two helpers suspected of dumping his body in panic after
 he died on his way to hospital, have been questioned.

State prosecutors will now decide whether to recommend charges.

Colombian medical authorities said the cause of the death has not been definitely established.

Fellow traveller Christopher Dearden 
has told how Henry made animal noises and tried to fly after taking the 
drug, said to create hallucinations more extreme than those caused by 
LSD, ketamine or magic mushrooms.

He said: 'He wasn’t speaking, he was lashing out with his hands and feet.

'Then he started making weird animal noises and at one point he tried to fly.'

Other tourists at the ceremony near Mocoa, south-east Colombia, said the shaman's family promised to look after Henry when he fell ill.

Tribal: The drug is said to produce an 'extreme hallucinogenic reaction' that takes the user on a 'journey'

The drug is found in the Andes in Southern Colombia. Henry was one of many tourists who try the substance

But police arrived as they ate 
breakfast the next day at remote rainforest land belonging to the 
Kamentsa tribe to say his body had been found nearby.

The
 Casa del Rio hostel in Mocoa in the Putumayo region, where Henry was 
staying, promoted the drug on the ‘things to do’ section of its website.

The website entry read: ‘Experience Yage, Indian tradition taking a medicinal plant which purifies and can make you hallucinate’.

His devastated parents Elizabeth and David and brother Freddie paid tribute to the fun-loving teenager, who was due to study English literature, language, linguistics and media at Brighton University in September.

They described him in a statement 
released yesterday as an 'adventurous person' who was 'polite, popular 
with a great sense of humour and was very much loved by his family and 
friends'.

Education: Henry attended the North Bristol Post Centre and had accepted a place at the University of Brighton

They added: 'We understand that he took part in a local tribal ritual recommended by the hostel he was staying at. 

'The ritual involves a drink made from local plant infusions.

'We are awaiting further information from the Foreign Office but it is likely that a reaction to this drink was the cause.'
