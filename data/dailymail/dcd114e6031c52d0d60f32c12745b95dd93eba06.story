FIFA experts have officially awarded Brazil's goal in the last-16 match against Chile to David Luiz.

Luiz claimed the goal in the 1-1 draw, which was finally settled by a penalty shoot-out in Brazil's favour, but television replays appeared to show that Thiago Silva's header had been deflected in by Chile defender Gonzalo Jara.

FIFA's technical study group has now studied the goal at all available angles - there are 34 cameras in each stadium - and are convinced former Chelsea defender Luiz, who has been signed by Paris St Germain, had the last touch.

A FIFA spokeswoman said: 'The technical study group has looked at this and the goal will remain awarded to David Luiz. They have studied it and say he definitely had the last touch.'
