It's no secret that Mars is a beaten and battered planet - astronomers have been peering for centuries at the violent impact craters created by cosmic buckshot pounding its surface over billions of years.

But just how beat up is it?

Really beat up, according to a University of Colorado Boulder research team that recently finished counting, outlining and cataloging a staggering 635,000 impact craters on Mars that are roughly a kilometer or more in diameter.

History written on its face: The surface of Mars is covered with thousands upon thousands of crater impacts over the planet's life

As the largest single database ever 
compiled of impacts on a planet or moon in our solar system, the new 
information will be of help in dating the ages of particular regions of 
Mars, said CU-Boulder postdoctoral researcher Stuart Robbins, who led 
the effort.

The new crater atlas also should help 
researchers better understand the history of water volcanism on Mars 
through time, as well as the planet's potential for past habitability by
primitive life, he said.

'This database is a giant tool that 
will be helpful in scores of future Mars studies ranging from age-dating
and erosion to planetary habitability and to other applications we have
not even thought of yet,' said Robbins, who is affiliated with 
CU-Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics.

'In a sense it's like building a new and better hammer, which quickly becomes used by everyone.

'We have all this new information 
coming from Mars orbiters and landers that have helped generate far 
better maps illustrating the planet's topography and surface details. I 
basically analyzed maps and drew crater rim circles for four years.'

Co-author Brian Hynek, a LASP research
associate and assistant professor in the geological sciences 
department, said knowing more about the history and extent of Martian 
cratering has implications for better understanding the potential for 
past life on Mars.

He said: 'Many of the large impact 
craters generated hydrothermal systems that could have created unique, 
locally habitable environments that lasted for thousands or millions of 
years, assuming there was water in the planet's crust at the time.

'But large impacts also have the 
ability to wipe out life forms, as evident from Earth's dinosaur-killing
Chicxulub impact 65 million years ago.'

While there are only about 150 to 200 known impact craters left on 
Earth, both the moon and Mercury are still peppered with craters due to 
their lack of atmosphere and plate tectonic activity, he said.

Cataloging the cratering of Mars and the moon is helping scientists 
understand a time a few hundred million years after the inner solar 
system formed, including an event about 3.9 billion years ago known as 
the 'Late Heavy Bombardment' in which asteroids as large as Kansas 
rained down on Earth.

'Although Earth has lost most of its geologic record due to tectonic 
plate movements and erosion, understanding the impact crater history on 
the moon and Mars can help us reconstruct our early days,' said Hynek.

The asteroids litter the landscape - as they would on Earth except we have a geologically active world

Robbins said most of the smaller 
diameter craters on Mars are younger than the largest craters and form 
the bulk of the planet's crater population.

'The basic idea of age dating is that 
if a portion of the planet's surface has more craters, it has been 
around longer,' said Robbins.

Much of the planet has been 
'resurfaced' by volcanic and erosional activity, essentially erasing 
older geological features, including craters.

The new database also is expected to 
help planetary scientists better understand erosion on the planet, said 
Robbins, who earned his doctoral degree from CU-Boulder's astrophysical 
and planetary sciences department.

'Our crater database contains both rim
heights and crater depths, which can help us differentiate between 
craters that have been filled in versus those that have eroded by 
different processes over time, giving us a better idea about long-term 
changes on the planet's surface.'

Having a better handle on the size and
distribution of Martian impact craters also has implications for 
future, manned missions to the planet, said Hynek.

NASA wants to know where the craters 
are and their particular features both from a safety and research 
standpoint. 'Craters act as a 'poor man's drill' that provide new 
information about the subsurface of Mars,' he said.

Since the most complete databases of 
lunar craters include only those roughly 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter
or larger, and databases on Mercury's craters contain only those over 
roughly 20 kilometers in diameter, it is difficult to compare them with 
the Martian crater database, said Robbins.
