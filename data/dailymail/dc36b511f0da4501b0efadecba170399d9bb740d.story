From afar these intricate portraits appear to be painted using the finest of brushstrokes, but take a step closer and the amazing reality is unraveled: they've been carefully crafted out of reels of folded fabric.

These jaw-dropping creations by London-born artists Benjamin Shine each contain 10 to 50 metres of tulle pleated, folded and finally ironed in place to create evocatively realistic images.

The artist, an alumni of the prestigious Central St Martin’s art school, now based between Sydney and London, explains how he first conceived the idea.

‘It wasn’t until I saw a crumpled ball of tulle on my studio floor that I noticed its potential.

'Pressing it behind glass, various tones became apparent and I began to test out ways to create identifiable images by manipulating the pleats within the single piece,’ he says.

Now there are 50 tulle portraits spread across the world from Monaco and New York to London.

As well as images of legends such as Andy Warhol, Princess Diana and Elizabeth Taylor, Benjamin has also created works of current icons including Obama and Princess Charlene.

The Princess Charlene portrait was unveiled at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco last year and is now exhibited at Monaco's Barclays Building.

Obama’s 'Changing States' portrait was unveiled on inauguration day at the New York Museum of Arts and Design and also became the official commemorative image on merchandise sold through Barnes and Noble book stores across the US.

‘The piece is made from a single decommissioned US flag, torn and re-woven into the image of the President, retaining the silhouette of the original flag and with all the pieces from it,’ explains the artist.

'"Changing States" referenced the ideals of hope and change that Obama championed during his 2008/9 campaign. The piece is currently on loan to a private collector in the US,’ Benjamin adds.

Benjamin’s other wealthy private clients include Arab sheiks, Sir Phillip Greene and his daughter Chloe.

But there’s one wealthy woman still on Benjamin’s wish-list. ‘I would love to create a portrait of the Queen,' he says.

Another private client to own one if these enchanting pieces is ex-model Orly Wolfson whose husband, businessman and philanthropist Andrew (brother of Next boss Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise), commissioned the portrait as a surprise for her 30th birthday.

‘My reaction when I saw it was, “Wow!”,’ says the stunning mum-of-two. ‘It was an amazing gift.’

And when friends and family see the piece they are equally stunned. ‘People are always amazed by how lifelike it is and wonder how it can be created out of one piece of material,’ she says.

‘A portrait of yourself is very personal but the way Benjamin captured me is spot on,’ adds Orly. ‘But when I look at it I see a piece of art rather than just a portrait of me.’

So can the artist reveal how he creates 
magic from scrunched up fabric?

‘Firstly the uncut length is piled onto a
 canvas as a dense voluminous layer,’ he says. ‘Once entirely covered, I
 take a deep breath and go for it!

‘I move the tulle around, pressing, pleating and bunching it to form the basic tones and textures.

‘This initial placement sets up the 
entire process before I focus on the detail. Then the tulle is bonded to
 the canvas using a hot iron,' reveals the artist.

‘I always envisaged building a diverse 
body of work with this medium but subsequently became inundated with 
portrait commissions!’ he says.

‘The final piece remains three-dimensional, set back behind glass,’ Benjamin adds.

‘Initially the portraits were simply a 
test-bed for the technique -- I felt if I could create an accurate 
likeness, then anything else could be possible.'

And last year, Givenchy’s creative director Riccardo Tisci also came knocking.

‘Initially I thought he wanted me to create something as a backdrop to a show or for their stores but when I learned he wanted me to create the pieces as clothing, it really pushed the limit,' he admits.

The artist crafted this portrait of Andy Warhol, called 'Fame', from 15 metres of fabric

‘I had to create the detailed faces at a much smaller scale than anything I had done before, but in doing so it opened up a whole new realm of possibility,’ says the artist.

The one-of-a-kind pieces were made-to-order from Givenchy’s Haute Couture salons.

Another of his most challenging commissions was an installation for London Design Week, called ‘The Hands of Time’ featuring two clasped hands. ‘It was tricky because of its size,’ he explains.

‘“Hands of Time” showed me the free-flowing nature of the fabric was as interesting as the detail I was manipulating.

‘So the current series I’m now working on explores a more instinctive, looser approach that shifts the focus from the perfected image to the more ambiguous, abstract and expressive form that’s guided by the natural flow of the material itself,’ Benjamin explains.

This series of tulle works will be exhibited at Opera Gallery in London, where he currently has some pieces on show.

So how long does it take Benjamin to carefully fold and pleat the tulle into its final incarnation? ‘I tend to work on several pieces at one time so I don’t time them by the hour, but I like to work and live with each portrait for several months.

Deciding the colours is a process in itself. ‘Sometimes a colour can has a particular relevance, but most often I will do several tests in different colours before deciding which one works,’ he says.

Benjamin's was commissioned by Givenchy to use his method to create haute couture pieces for the brand

Benjamin's work has been exhibited in galleries including New York Museum of Arts and Design, The London Design Museum and The British Crafts Council.

Currently the tulle pieces are available through Opera Gallery London and Opera Gallery Monaco and his Elizabeth Taylor Portrait is exhibited at The Grace, a private health club in Belgravia.

A more fluid approach give Benjamin's latest works an ethereal quality

Benjamin is now hard at work on his new series as well as other projects. ‘I‘m always interested in creating something new, something people haven’t seen or experienced before, something that inspires the reaction How? or Wow!,' says the artist.

Well, wow-ed we certainly are.
