Donald Trump said that he has 'gigantic' news about the President which he will announce on Twitter Wednesday

Donald Trump announced today that he has a 'gigantic' bombshell about President Obama that he will reveal on Wednesday.

The billionaire real estate baron told Fox & Friends this morning that he had 'something very, very big concerning the president of the United States'.

'It's going to be very big. I know one thing- you will cover it in a very big fashion,' he added.

Trump wasn't giving away any clues, however, but only went on to say that it could 'possibly' play a role in the election.

He said h is waiting to Tweet the 'large, bordering on gigantic' news 'sometime probably Wednesday'.

Trump has been one of the most outspoken critics of the President and has also threatened to run against him.

He has also toured New Hampshire and said very clearly that he was seriously contemplating a presidential run. 

Later he became something of a political touchstone for the various Republican candidates and eventually endorsed Mitt Romney.

He has been extremely vocal as a 
so-called birther conspiracy theorist, claiming that Obama was born 
outside of the United States making him unable to run for President.

He believes that his Hawaiian birth certificate is fake or non-existent.

In April 2011, Trump announced that he paid to have a team of investigators to Hawaii to truly delve into the issue.

In response, President Obama released the long form edition of his birth certificate after spending years refusing to do so.

'Normally, I would not comment on something like this...I've got other things to do,' Obama said at the time.

Coming up: The mysterious website claims to have documents (which are muzzed in the picture) that reveal something about one of the two candidates but it is unclear which

Competition: A site called October Surprise claims to have revealing documents about one of the candidates

This is the second time in as 
many months that Trump has said that he has a big surprise that would be
 damaging to the President, though the last time he said so - in the 
days leading up to the Republican National Convention - nothing came of 
it.

Trump's announcement 
comes the same day as another surprise: a mysterious website called 'The
 October Surprise' says that it will release documents at 5.30pm on 
Monday.

Very little is known about the 
creators of the site, the type of documents that they are referring to, 
or even their intended target.

The
 Twitter bio for the site simply reads: 'One of your presidential 
candidates isn't being honest with you. Stay tuned to find out which one
 it is.'

Star: Trump, seen here with Bret Michaels who stars on All Star Celebrity Apprentice, has been a critic of Obama and his presidency for years

Political power: In February, Trump held a press conference endorsing Mitt Romney's presidential bid

The big reveal will take place just 
hours before the third and final debate which is dedicated to foreign 
policy. As a result, spectators believe that the documents- which 
allegedly are muzzed and used as the picture on The October surprise 
sites- relate to a foreign issue.

Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy: We have sources, Donald, that you have a large, bordering on gigantic announcement this week?

Trump: I do.

Doocy: What is it?

Trump: I's going to be announced probably on Wednesday but I have something very very big concerning the president of the United states.

Doocy: Give us a hint!

Trump: I won't do that.

Doocy: Just a little hint!

Trump: I won't do that, but I will talk to you probably on Wednesday. That's probably when I'm going to announce... It's going to be very big, I know one thing: you will cover it in a very big fashion

Fox & Friends host Gretchen Carlson: Will it change the election?

Trump: Possibly.

Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade: Is it personal or does it have to do with how he governs?

Trump: All in one, everything. It's very big. Bigger than anyone would know.

'We can't predict media/campaign reaction, but the content is irrefutable,' the creators wrote to one Twitter inquiry.

Sensing
 a playful competition between the two reveals, The October Surprise 
tweeted at Trump, saying that they beat him by making a big 
announcement. There is no telling if the two announcements are related 
in any way.

While The October Surprise is keeping both candidates in the dark, Trump was not as impartial. The
 billionaire businessman-turned-reality star and Obama have a barbed 
relationship on both sides. Trump repeatedly called Obama 'the worst 
president ever', and Obama referred to Trump as a 'carnival barker' once
 he released the long form birth certificate.

The President also spent a portion of his speech at the White House Correspondent's Dinner in April 2011 taking jabs at Trump.

'Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald,' Obama said in the speech.

'And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter –- like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?'

Over the past year, Trump's birther 
rhetoric has died down significantly and he has focused his attention to
 the Republican primary race, eventually supporting Romney's bid.

Though
 his endorsement came in May, the latest endorsement from the Trump clan
 came just three days ago. Donald's daughter Ivanka is married to Jared 
Kushner, the owner of The New York Observer. While there was no mention 
of the paper's ties to the real estate mogul, it did surprise some to 
see the paper reverse it's 2008 endorsement of Obama and come out in favor of Romney just three days ago.
