Jane Campbell, 80, bears the marks of the street robbery she fell victim to just yards from her garden gate in Deane, near Bolton, Greater Manchester

An 80-year-woman was hurled face-down into the road by hooded attackers who made off with her handbag.

The two thugs were caught on CCTV attacking Jane Campbell just yards from her garden gate as she returned from a trip to pick up her prescriptions.

After surprising her in the secluded spot, they snatched hold of her and span her around with such force she tripped and smacked her face into the pavement.

She was left badly shaken, with cuts 
and bruises, but luckily suffered no serious injuries. Her handbag was 
taken but when it was found later nothing had been stolen.

Police say they are 'determined to find' the two diminutive crooks, one of whom is described as just 5ft 3in tall.

 Ms Campbell said: 'The one that jumped on me from behind I heard he was
 shouting to someone on the other side of the road in a foreign 
language.

'It has knocked my
 confidence for going out. I would be frightened to get my pension on my
 own as people might just follow me out.

'Unfortunately my partner is ill but I have managed to visit my sister, who lives four doors down, most nights.

'But I will be okay, they canâ€™t keep a good girl down.'

CCTV footage of the attack showed the 
pensioner as she made her way along Willows Lane in Deane, near Bolton, 
Greater Manchester, last month.

She
 walks past two men at a bus stop. She is then followed by two men as 
she walks into an alley. It is as she approaches her gate that she comes
 under attack.

Detective 
Constable David Fox, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'From what we 
have been told, we believe the offenders were the same people who were 
seen by the bus stop and in the road.

'The
 elderly lady has simply made a trip to her local chemist to pick up her
 prescription and walked home. Unknowingly to her, she was followed.

'It is an absolute disgrace these cowardly men have targeted her in such a way and we are determined to find them.

'She
 was spun around in such a force, she fell, hitting the floor with her 
face. Luckily, she suffered cuts and bruises but she has understandably 
been left shocked this robbery has happened outside her home.

'I would ask anyone who may have any information or recognise the description of the pair to contact us.'
