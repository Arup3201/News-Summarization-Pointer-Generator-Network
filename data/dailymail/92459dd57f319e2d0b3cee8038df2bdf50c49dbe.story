Troubling: The council heavily criticised for failing to protect 'Baby P' - Peter Connelly - has been found wanting in another child abuse case

A toddler was sent home to be beaten horrifically by his abusive parents after a series of blunders by social workers from the same council which failed Baby P.

The child was twice taken to hospital with more than 50 injuries after being beaten with a belt, a stick and a cable – but both times staff at Haringey Council allowed him to be sent back to be tortured again.

The case, which emerged in a scathing report yesterday, is the latest in a series of failings by the scandal-hit council.

While the child’s life was saved, his neglect chillingly echoes the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, whose mother Tracey was this week cleared for release after serving just four years behind bars.

In the more recent case, the boy, Child T, was taken to hospital at least three times over eight months.

On one occasion he had more than 50 bruises after being repeatedly beaten up by his Polish parents.

A review found multiple failings by doctors, police and social workers for not intervening sooner and failing to learn from what happened to Baby P.

‘Peter Connelly died three years before the first detected injuries to Child T. It is worrying to find compelling evidence of individual and systemic failures within and between services so soon after that high-profile case,’ the report, by the Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board, said.

‘One might expect, if anything, that agencies would be over sensitive to the possibility of abuse going undetected.’

Chairman Graham Badman added: ‘What is clear is because of failings in the system this child suffered physical abuse that could have been prevented.’

Child T’s injuries were first seen at North Middlesex Hospital in June 2010. He had bruising around his eyes, forehead and nose as well as injuries to his chest and hip area.

His Polish stepfather, a heroin user identified as Mr C, claimed the boy often ran around the house and ‘bangs and hits himself on the wall’.

After an assessment, the consultant paediatrician wrongly faxed a report to Enfield Council. It said when police later visited the home, officers had ‘no concerns’ about the child’s welfare or ‘home conditions’ with the mother and step-father, who are originally from Poland.

At follow-up meetings, no decisions were taken by social workers and police child abuse experts.

At one point, Mr C took his child to his GP under the premise he was concerned his child ‘bruised easily’. While a health worker noted he has ‘quite uncommon injuries’ for a child of his age, no one followed up the concerns

Three months later, during an appointment with a GP and a later one with a nurse at the surgery, he was found to have additional bruising to his back, arms and legs.

In February 2011, police were called to the family home and officers noticed Child T was extensively bruised. The next day he was taken by police to hospital where he was found to have more than 50 bruises of varying ages and sizes.

He told the doctor he had been hit with a
belt and a stick by Mr C. Later that month, in an interview with a 
social worker, he said he had told his mother about being hit. He also 
said ‘daddy’ had hit him with a belt and cable.

Child T’s stepfather was sentenced to four years in prison in October 2011 for wilfully assaulting a young person under the age of 16 and will be deported.

The boy’s mother, referred to as Ms B, is understood to have returned to Poland.

The boy, who is now six, was removed from the family home with his three siblings in 2011 – more than a year after the first abuse was noted.

Disgusted: Local MP Lynn Featherstone said: 'It is just appalling Haringey Council have become embroiled in another child abuse scandal'

They are now in care.

The report found weaknesses across all the agencies involved in the child’s case. It stated there was a ‘reluctance to “think the unthinkable” and recognise all the adults in the family as perpetrators of abuse’.

The case comes 13 years after the death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie, who Haringey also failed to protect when she was tortured and murdered by her great-aunt and her boyfriend.

Local MP Lynne Featherstone said: ‘After these two horrendous failures, serious changes should have been made.

‘Indeed, the review identifies features that are common between the Baby P and the Child T cases.

‘What makes me even more upset and angry, is Haringey’s Labour leadership have repeatedly told us lessons had been learnt, and Children’s Services had turned a corner. But this was evidently not true – now another child has paid the price.’

Council leader Claire Kober said: ‘We fully accept the findings and apologise unreservedly for the failings set out in the report.

‘Together with partner agencies, we could and should have intervened more swiftly. This case occurred during a period of rebuilding in our children’s service.

‘We have been working hard over the past three years to make significant improvements, which have been recognised by Ofsted.’
