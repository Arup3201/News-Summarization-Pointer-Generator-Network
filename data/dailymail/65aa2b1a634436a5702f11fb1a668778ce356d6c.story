The powerbrokers behind Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg will meet in London on Wednesday in an effort to finally make a fight that could be the biggest in Britain this year.

Barry McGuigan, who manages Frampton, will sit down with Quigg’s promoter Eddie Hearn at breakfast to try to iron out the issues standing between the two super-bantamweight world champions.

If successful, the hope is for a summer showdown that will net a seven-figure payday for each man, but significant obstacles remain in the way, with Hearn concerned that unless progress is made in the next two weeks then the long-awaited fight will be delayed further.

The principle challenge surrounds television companies, with IBF champion Frampton enjoying huge exposure on ITV while Hearn’s fighters, including WBA (regular) champion Quigg, operate on Sky Sports.

Hearn has already submitted a proposal for staging a pay-per-view fight on Sky and, as such, is likely to offer a greater purse. But McGuigan has long been adamant that the fight should prioritise the exposure of terrestrial television over ‘greed’.

Hearn told Sportsmail yesterday: ‘I will meet Barry McGuigan and Carl Frampton’s team in London on Wednesday. It’s the fight everyone wants to see - two world champions from Britain in the same division. They simply have to fight.

‘I have given my proposal to them and am waiting to hear what they have from their side. I feel we need to make progress now. The hope is for a summer fight, possibly on June 20.

‘I think we need to reach some kind of agreement soon, probably the next two or three weeks, if we are to get this fight on in the summer. It really is the fight people want to see.’

Frampton, 28, extended his perfect record to 20 wins against Chris Avalos in February, while Quigg is unbeaten with 30 wins and two draws. Options for staging the bout currently include Belfast, which would mean a home fight for Frampton, as well as Manchester and the O2 Arena in London.

Meanwhile, a decision is set to be made on James DeGale’s world-title fight against Andre Dirrell. The pair had been expected to fight next month in Chicago for the IBF super-middleweight belt vacated by Carl Froch, but Sportsmail understands that bout is now likely to take place in May in the US.
