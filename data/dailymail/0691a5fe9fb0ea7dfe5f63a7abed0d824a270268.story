A streaker who dashed in front of the Olympic flame appeared in court today where he denied a charge of indecent exposure.

Daniel Leer charged through the streets of Henley-on-Thames as the torch passed through earlier this month, naked but for a pair of trainers and the words 'Free Tibet' painted across his back.

The blond 27-year-old had admitted his daring dash, but today denied a charge of indecent exposure, a sexual offence, when he stood in the dock at Oxford Magistrates’ Court.

During the 15-minute hearing the court, including the District Judge, broke into giggles as Leer’s exploits were outlined.

On July 10, as the torch was carried through Henley, Leer’s home town, the waiter took to the streets himself, carrying his own version of the Olympic flame, just minutes before the real version was handed to celebrated rower Sir Steve Redgrave.

'Approximately 2,000 people including school children were waiting for the torch to pass through,' said Sarah Mackay, prosecuting.

'Naked apart from a pair of training shoes on his feet he was carrying a replica Olympic torch in his hand and was smiling and waving at the crowds.

'As well as adults there were school children and he was arrested straightaway.'

The man's time in the limelight was short-lived, however, as he was bundled away by officers

District Judge Lynne Matthews was told
that Leer admitted causing a public order offence due to his disruptive
behaviour, but would be denying the charge of indecent exposure when 
the trial took place at the same court in October.

'This
wasn’t a sexual offence, the offence as charged requires the intention 
to cause alarm or distress,' said Sally Thompson, defending. 'That 
wasn’t the intention.'

Mrs Thompson said that Leer’s actions had been a 'high spirited' political protest to draw attention to the situation in Tibet.

'This is a young man of good character, he accepts the facts of what he has done,' said Mrs Thompson.

Leer,
who wore a dark grey suit and tie, looked serious throughout most of 
the hearing, apart from when District Judge Matthews made a joke about 
the conditions under which he had been placed on bail.

He
has been banned from coming within 100 metres of any Olympic venue, 
including roads where the torch relay and events were taking place, or 
going within 100 metres of the River Thames - unless underground or 
going about his employment as a waiter for the duration of the games, 
until September 3.

Leer had 
also been told that he could not enter Henley town centre, the Royal 
Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, the City of London and the City of 
Westminster for fear that he might disrupt further Olympic events.

Judge Matthews prompted laughter when she suggested that these restrictions be amended to 'unless fully clothed.'

She added: 'Being clothed can be defined as to whether in his mind it means wearing a pair of trainers.'

As well as carrying the fake torch, the 27-year-old streaker also had 'Free Tibet' written on his back

Leer,
who attended court with members of his family, was told that he must 
return to court tomorrow where the bail conditions would be reviewed 
after prosecutors had examined them overnight.

Judge Matthews told Leer that the existing conditions would remain in place until then.

He
had also been barred from taking part in any activity which disrupts 
any intended or anticipated activities of the Olympic games, from 
obstructing the movement or passage of any Olympic participants between 
their residence, practice venue or place of work and venues being used 
for Olympic competition or cultural purposes.

Leer
was told that his trial, expected to last around two hours, would take 
place on October 30 at Oxford Magistrates’ Court, once the Olympic Games
had concluded.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
