Ukip could force the Tories into third place in next week’s by-election in the Manchester constituency of Wythenshawe and Sale East.

A poll by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft suggests Labour will comfortably retain the seat vacated by the death of former minister Paul Goggins.

It puts Labour on 61 per cent, up 17 points on the 2010 general election result. But Ukip, led by Nigel Farage, comes second on 15 per cent – 12 points higher than in 2010.

This edges Ukip ahead of the Conservatives on 14 per cent, down from the 26 per cent the Tories garnered in 2010, when they came second.

The poll shows the Lib Dems trailing on just 5 per cent.

Ex-Tory donor Lord Ashcroft said: ‘Ukip have more than quadrupled their vote share in the constituency since 2010 – but if there is to be a surge to take the seat it is either very late or a long way below the radar.’

‘Not surprisingly, those who have switched to UKIP – largely but by no means exclusively from the Tories – are more likely than most to say they are voting tactically... or as a protest.’

Despite Labour’s huge lead, the poll shows only a minority of voters in the constituency, 43 per cent, would prefer Ed Miliband to David Cameron as Prime Minister.

In fact, a quarter of Labour voters (and more than half of Ukip supporters) say either that they are satisfied with Mr Cameron or they prefer him to the alternative.

One in five Labour voters say they trust the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne more than their own party’s top team of Mr Miliband and Ed Balls.
