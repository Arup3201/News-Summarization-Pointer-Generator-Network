A treasured family heirloom has gone missing at a leading wine merchant's home after 50 gatecrashers spotted an invite to his teenage son's party on Facebook.

Graham Sumeray, chief executive of Fine and Rare Wines, and his wife, Sax, went out for dinner on Saturday evening, after allowing their 16-year-old son, Hugo, to invite some friends to the four-bedroom family home in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.

However, in every parent's worst nightmare, fifty uninvited guests turned up after spotting the invitation on Facebook.

A Baccarat paperweight, similar to the one pictured, was allegedly stolen at wine merchant Graham Sumeray's house in Henley-on-Thames, Oxon, last Saturday

An iPod also went missing when 50 gatecrashers descended on the home of Mr Sumeray, pictured. It came after his teenage son posted an invite on Facebook

The heirloom, a Baccarat paperweight, and an iPod were allegedly stolen during the party.

Police and an ambulance also arrived after a fight broke out between two boys and a 16-year-old suffered a broken nose and needed eight stitches.

The Sumerays returned home at 10.30pm and went straight to bed whilst the party carried on. They only discovered the damage when they woke up the next morning.

Mr Sumeray said: 'I got up to find a broken manhole cover in front of my drive and they told me it was caused by an ambulance.

'I was told that at the end of the night some friends ordered a taxi and so did the gatecrashers and there was a bit of a fight.'

The Sumerays returned to their house, pictured, around 10.30pm and went to bed with the party still going on

Mr Sumeray, a father of three, said he had taken precautions and moved their valuables into locked rooms before the party.

He pleaded for the return of the paperweight, which has a frog on it with a yellow water lily.

The paperweight is one of two that was given to Mr Sumeray by his father, a collector, on his death bed in 2004.

Mr Sumeray said: 'I think I heard someone say that Hugo had put it up on Facebook before someone told him that was a silly thing to do and it was removed.'
