The $35 million program to retrain New York City cops in the aftermath of Eric Garner's death last July has been branded a big flop by a high-ranking NYPD official.

To date a fifth of the city's 20,000 strong force has taken the course which was introduced last December by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton in a bid to address criticism of the illegal chokehold maneuver that resulted in the death of the father-of-six. 

Once officers gave completed the three-day 'smart policing' course they are asked to fill out a survey, but the results have been less than impressive.

A high-ranking official – who wasn't named - told the New York Post that of the 2,000 surveys reviewed eight out of every ten officers have branded the exercise a waste of time.

The problem says the insider is that the course involves too little practical training and two days of boring eight-hour lectures that have caused some cops to fall asleep.

'It's three days, it's boring and there's no real tactics,' said the Post's source. 'They're not putting them in scenarios. Cops felt they would get more tactical training in light of the Eric Garner case.'

On Day 3 of the course officers are taught the 'high-low takedown,' in which two cops apprehend a suspect, one from behind at the legs, the other from the front at the torso.

Mayor de Blasio had ordered a review into training within the department following Garner's death.

The 43-year-old died after NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a illegal chokehold during an attempted arrest on Staten Island on July 17, 2014.

Officers were attempting to arrest Garner because they suspected he had been selling untaxed cigarettes illegally.

'The training that's going to happen here in this building will change the future of this city,' said de Blasio when he introduced the scheme.

'It will have not just an impact on thousands of people, it will have an impact on millions of people, because every interaction that every officer has with their fellow New Yorkers after they are trained again will be different.' 

A deputy NYPD commissioner appointed to reform the department in the wake of Garner's death has lasted just two months in the job, it was announced Saturday.

Michael Julian has been moved to a less controversial position after he proposed officers be supplied with breath mints to prevent them from swearing and that protesters should be sprayed with baby oil so they would be easier to remove..

A source told the New York Post: 'He would come up with these wacky ideas. We would roll our eyes and move on.'

Julian ordered 10,000 individually wrapped breath mints which were delivered to the NYPD headquarters building.

The mints were due to be deployed to individual officers, who would then be instructed to unpeel the wrapper if they felt the urge to swear.

Julian believed that by the time the officer had unwrapped the mint and placed it into his mouth, he would no longer want to curse.

Earlier he had suggested that police should deploy baby oil in situations when protesters link arms and sit down.

He claimed that the baby oil would prevent the protesters from hanging onto each other and officers with rubber gloves could remove them easily.

It is understood that Julian was removed from his position as deputy commissioner for training following the gaffes and transferred to the personnel department.
