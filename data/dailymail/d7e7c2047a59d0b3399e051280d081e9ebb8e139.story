Clad only in underpants, socks and trainers, a boy of four stands shivering in the snow.

At the sound of a barked command, the freezing child is forced to perform press-ups.

Repeatedly he pleads to be allowed to stop and asks for his mother, but his entreaties fall on deaf ears.

Incredibly, the adults responsible for the little boy’s pitiful ordeal were his own parents.

Sparked outrage: Filmed on the Chinese New Year's Eve, the video shows a man identified only as 'eagle daddy' stripping his son to his underwear and forcing him to run around snow-covered streets in temperatures below freezing

Bitterly cold: As he stands shivering in the cold, he is seen pleading with his father 'Please give me a hug!'

They are facing demands for their son 
to be taken into care after footage of the disturbing incident was 
placed on the video-sharing website YouTube.

It is not clear who posted the 99-second clip, headed Chinese Eagle Dad Trains 4-year-old Son To Jog Naked in NYC’s Heavy Snow.

In comments posted online, ‘eagle 
daddy’ claims his son was born several months premature and doctors 
worried he might suffer developmental difficulties.

To counter those fears, the father, 
said to be a businessman from the eastern city of Nanjing and apparently
 visiting the U.S. for Chinese New Year, came up with a harsh regime to 
build the boy’s strength and mental toughness.

Distressed: After running around for five minutes, the boy is then encouraged to do a push-up on the snowy ground, but the distressed little boy cries out

Father and son: In comments posted by 'eagle daddy' online, it states his son was born several months early and doctors said that he might suffer developmental difficulties so he has developed a strict education plan for his son to help him grow up healthy

The clip begins with a shot of the boy, named as Ho Yide, standing in the snow in clear distress.

He is then shown walking, fists 
clenched against the cold, past parked cars covered in several inches of
 snow. At one point he begs: ‘Please give me a hug.’

His mother can apparently be heard 
laughing and encouraging him to endure the icy ordeal. One viewer wrote:
 ‘The child would be better off in care. This father is a monster.’

But online comments from a woman 
described as the father’s assistant said the child had agreed to run in 
the snow: ‘This child has received all sorts of forms of  training since
 he was small.’

She said the father ‘doesn’t care what others say’, adding: ‘The fact that the child lived shows he has tenacious vitality.’
