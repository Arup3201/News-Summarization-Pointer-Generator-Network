France and Germany has controversially told Greece it should place state revenues into a separate fund so it can pay off its crushing debt - to avoid bankruptcy and prevent the crash of the single currency.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy told a Paris news conference, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that Greece's new leaders must also 'take their responsibility'.

The pair, dubbed Merkozy for their close co-operation in recent months, also said that that any new bailout will require taking decisions to reduce debt.

The comments, which are likely to provoke anger in Greece, came after the 14th French-German Council of Ministers, which focused on co-ordinating the countries' tax policies as well as Europe's debt crisis.

Last-gasp: Can Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos get his coalition government to agree to the IMF deal?

It also came as Greece was today due to make a last-ditch attempt to stave off bankruptcy, in a bid to stop sending the eurozone into economic chaos which could ultimately bring down the single currency.

Parties backing the country's coalition government will meet again to try and secure an austerity deal with rescue creditors. It follows an intense weekend of negotiations which failed to produce a breakthrough.

Prime Minister Lucas Papademos will meet leaders of three parties backing his coalition, who all publicly oppose steep cuts in private sector pay demanded by negotiators representing eurozone lenders and the International Monetary Fund.

The new 130billion euro bailout deal is vital for Greece avoid bankruptcy next month as it cannot cover a 14.5billion euro bond repayment due on March 20.

Tied to that deal are plans by banks and other private bondholders to forgive 100billion euro in Greek debt in exchange for a cash payment and new bonds with more lenient repayment terms.

Over the weekend, Greek officials held a conference call with eurozone finance ministers, as well as exhaustive rounds of talks in Athens with EU-IMF debt inspectors, senior bank negotiators, and Greek political party leaders, to try and hammer out a deal.

An announcement from Papademos' office said agreement had been reached to cut 2012 spending by 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product - about 3.3billion euro.

They had also agreed to improve competitiveness by slashing wages and non-wage costs, and re-capitalising banks without nationalizing them.

But the three coalition backers - 
Socialist George Papandreou, Conservative Antonis Samaras and George 
Karatzaferis of the rightist LAOS party - differed as to what this would
mean in detailed proposals.

'We are in the middle of a major struggle. Right now, the developments are satisfactory,' said Karatzaferis.

He added that EU-IMF negotiators had 
backed away from a demand to axe annual salary instalments given to 
Greek workers as holiday bonuses.

Rescue lenders have also called for firings in Greece's large public sector, a drop in the 750 euro gross minimum monthly wage, and cuts in lump-sum retirement payouts, as part of a long list of cost-cutting demands.

Unions and employers' associations oppose the wage cuts, arguing it would worsen a recession in its fourth year and unemployment, already at around 19 per cent.

The speculation and rising fears saw European markets all start the week down.

The FTSE-100 opened 0.26 per cent down at 5,885.60; France's CAC 40 is 0.74 per cent down at 3,402.48; and Germany's DAX is 0.28 per cent down at 6,747.52.

Left wing opposition parties are also today planning two separate protest rallies in central Athens at 6pm against the proposed cuts.

Debt levels in bailed-out countries Greece, Portugal and Ireland continued to rise in the third quarter of last year.

But they fell for Italy and the 17-nation eurozone as a whole, official statistics showed today.Greece's debt level was highest, spiking to 159.1 per cent of gross domestic product and suggesting that repeated austerity cuts have yet to turn the country's finances around.

Despite the deterioration in the weakest members, overall debt in the eurozone fell to 87.4 per cent of GDP from 87.7 per cent in the second quarter, thanks mainly to improvements in the biggest economies like Germany and France.

Investors will take heart from the Eurostat figures showing debt stabilised in both Italy and Spain, the two economies seen as the next shakiest members of the currency union.

Italy managed to bring its debt down to 119.6 per cent from 121.2 per cent the previous quarter. However, at 1.88 trillion euro, its debt in nominal terms is still massive.

Spain's debt remained constant at 66 per cent of GDP between the second and third quarters, although it was up from just 58.7 per cent a year earlier.

The third-quarter figures give some hope that the eurozone may be able to contain the crisis to the three, relatively small countries it has already bailed out.
