The Queen got a bird's eye view of Buckingham Palace today as she scaled the Shard 
as part of a visit to a scheme helping to pay for some of the city's 
poorest students go to university.Â 

Standing at 310m high (1,016 ft),
 as Western Europe's tallest building, both the Queen and Duke of 
Edinburgh were treated to spectacular views of London's skyline - although Her Majesty seemed to veer away from the floor-to-ceiling windows as she met staff and some recipients of the Southwark Scholarship Scheme.

Phillip and the Queen visited levels 69 and 72 of the 
landmark building in London Bridge for a personal tour as they took in the view.

The Queen got a bird's eye view of London today as she scaled the Shard as part of a visit to a scheme helping to pay for some of the city's poorest students go to university

Mark Layden, 24, a member of The Shard's apprenticeship scheme, showed the monarch how to use a digital telescope, and helped her make out Buckingham Palace

The Queen dazzled onlookers in a bright purple wool coat finished
 with a black trim and gold buttons. A matching floral-trimmed hat and 
her favourite Launer handbag completed the look as she peered through an
 interactive telescope on the landmark's 69th floor, before braving the 
cold weather on the 800ft (244m) high open-air viewing gallery of the 
building at London Bridge.

She
 remarked that St Paul's Cathedral looked 'quite small' as she walked 
around the 360 degree gallery, known as The View. 'It's interesting, the
 different views and how people can see their houses,' she said.

The
 Queen was introduced to Mark Layden, 24, a member of The Shard's 
apprenticeship scheme, who showed the monarch how to use a digital 
telescope, which can identify landmarks across the capital and allows 
users to zoom in.

Speaking
 after the royal visit, Mr Layden said: 'I was stood by the telescope 
and she asked, "are you going to show me Buckingham Palace?"

'She liked how much you can zoom in. She seemed quite interested in a plane flying past on its way to City airport as well.'

Despite
 the grey skies above, the Queen and Duke stepped out on to the outdoor 
viewing platform on level 72, where they met staff and young people 
involved the Southwark Scholarship Scheme.

After unveiling a commemorative 
plaque and taking a guided tour of the record-breaking Shard the Queen 
visited Southwark Cathedral, where they were greeted by cheers from more than 200 local schoolchildren waving Union flags.

As they entered the historic building, choir singers sung the National Anthem before performing a rendition of the Vast Ocean of Light, which was written for the Diamond Jubilee.

The Queen giggled as she was introduced to the cathedral's cat, named Doorkins, who lay asleep on a chair inside the main hall.

'It goes for lunch in the market and then sleeps it off in the chair," Andrew Nunn, the Dean of Southwark, said.

The Queen was shown a stain-glassed 
window which features an image of her face after it was repaired 
following damage in the Second World War.

'I didn't know anything about it,' she said. 'It's very unlikely.'

The
 royal couple met members of the guild of broderers of the cathedral who
 are making a new set of jubilee copes to be worn by the four bishops of
 the diocese.

'It does take an age doesn't it,' the Queen said as she was introduced to the broderers.

During
 her visit, the Queen was shown a new stained glass window created by 
Icelandic artist Leifur Breidfjord to mark the Diamond Jubilee.

The lowest part of
 the design of the window bears the text Vivat Regina! Defender Of The 
Faith, Diamond Jubilee 2012 and the heraldic symbol of the Glaziers 
Company.

The design was commissioned after a competition by the Worshipful Company of Glassmakers and Painters of Glass.

The royal couple will meet the Deanery and Chapter of the Cathedral and representatives of the Icelandic Community.

They also met members of the Guild of Broderers of the Cathedral who are making a new set of 'Jubilee Copes' to be worn by the four bishops of the diocese.

As the royal couple left the cathedral, the Duke turned to a group of schoolchildren and asked: 'Anyone got frostbite yet?'
