Outrageous: James Tracy claims that the government was behind the Boston Marathon bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured

The so-called 'Nutty Professor' who said the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened is now willing to concede some people, indeed, lost their lives in the tragedy.

But James Tracy, a Florida Atlantic University tenured communications professor, is only seemingly willing to meet his many detractors half-way in their demands for outright contrition.

'There are certainly people that lost their loved ones, there is no doubt of that,' Tracy tells WLRN in Miami.

'If a similar tragedy were visited upon me and my family, I would be beside myself,' he reportedly said.

'But I think one of my ways of healing would be attempting to find out what went wrong, where was the failure.'

The 47-year-old professor suggested on his blog - memoryholeblog.com - the massacre at the least did not unfold in the way authorities said it did, and may not have happened at all.

'While it sounds like an outrageous claim, one is left to inquire whether the Sandy Hook shooting ever took place—at least in the way law enforcement authorities and the nation’s news media have described,' he wrote.

Tracy insinuated 'corporate media' 
institutions, as well as government authorities, spun official accounts 
of the massacre that left 26 dead, including 20 children, to drive a 
preconceived agenda of gun control in America.

'As documents relating to the Sandy 
Hook shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent 
researchers there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the 
massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public 
consumption to further larger political ends,' he wrote on his blog.

Tracy has seemingly based his allegations largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports released during the hectic day.

Tragic: One of the points of professor James Tracy's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers

However, as far as he's concerned, the
 media is still the one to blame for not pushing authorities hard enough
 on the tough questions.

In his WLRN interview, Tracy never 
apologizes for his prior remarks, but instead adds, 'The news media 
swooped into Newtown very briefly to cover the tragedy in a very 
vampiric sort of way, then swooped back out again without giving us any 
real answers.

'Then, they immediately went into the 
grieving mode. I'm not saying there's not a place for that. But if we 
want to actually pay homage to the events, we want to find out what 
actually went wrong. That's the greatest honor we can give them.'

The professor also responded to calls 
for his immediate termination, saying: 'I am sure (FAU is) receiving 
emails that are emotionally driven, but I would think if FAU wishes to 
revoke my tenure and terminate me, that's a blow against academics' 
being able to speak their minds on the events of the day.'

Political ends: He argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns

As with many conspiracy theorists who 
find darker linings in even the most horrific tragedies, this is far 
from his first foray into the world of the unproven.

Mr Tracy has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars, economic overhauls and union negotiations.

On
 his blog, however, he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy 
theories: the September 11 attacks, the purview of the Department of 
Homeland Security, the PATRIOT Act, the death of Osama bin Laden and 
Fukishima have all been topics of interest.

Even though he is paid to teach a 
class called Culture of Conspiracy which will undoubtedly produce 
outrageous ideas, Florida Atlantic University appears to feel that the 
questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far.

'James
 Tracy does not speak for the university. The website on which his post 
appeared is not affiliated with FAU in any way. As for any previous 
disciplinary actions at FAU, we do not comment on personnel matters,' 
school spokesman Lisa Metcalf said to the Sun Sentinel.
