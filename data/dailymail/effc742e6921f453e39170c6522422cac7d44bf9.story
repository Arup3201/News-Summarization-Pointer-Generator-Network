A stripper who ended up neglecting her children has been sentenced to 20 years behind bars.

The mother of two was found guilty of starving her two young children whilst she went out to work as an escort. 

It took jurors just two hours to find 24-year-old Kayela McClintick guilty on two counts of injury to a child. 

Guilty: Kayela McClintick, 24, has been sentenced to 20 years behind bars for neglecting her two children

Prosecutors told the jury that she forced the girls to stay in the closet when she stripped and performed lap dances for men at their home

The girls were left at this home in an upstairs bedroom. Medical experts testified at the trial that the younger girl had protruding ribs, a distended stomach and clumps of hair missing

During the trial McClintick took the stand, telling jurors that she still did not feel guilty.

'I take responsibility,' said McClintick. 'They are my kids, but I do not feel guilty about it.'

Mcclintick also stated that if she would have known that her two children were that bad off, she 'would have acted on it.'

Authorities only found out about the abuse when police were called to her home.

During her punishment hearing, McClintick, 24, took the stand in her own defense. McClintick said she fed her children three times a day with a snack in between

Her daughters are now in foster care. The oldest was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder

McClintick will be eligible for parole in 10 years

When they got there they found McClintick's six-year-old daughter in a closet and her two-year-old girl in an upstairs bedroom.

Both children were starving and dehydrated - so much so the toddler had to be taken to hospital.

Prosecutors told the jury that she forced the girls to stay in the closet when she stripped and performed lap dances for men at their home.

Medical experts testified at the trial that the younger girl had protruding ribs, a distended stomach and clumps of hair missing.

Both children were not being adequately fed.

'This was the ultimate betrayal,' said prosecutor Catherine Wilson during closing arguments. 'Send a message to our community. We will not allow our children to be starved.'

During her punishment hearing, McClintick, took the stand in her own defense.

'It's eating me from the inside out,' said McClintick who asked jurors for probation. 'If I would have known I would have acted on it.'

McClintick said she fed her children three times a day with a snack in between. She will be eligible for parole in ten years.

Prosecutors said the children suffered so much that there were no circumstances that warrant probation.

Her defense attorney tried to convince jurors to find some leniency in their approach by telling the McClintick was already facing enough punishment because her kids were taken away from her.

'For the fact that mom was stripping, that mom was an escort, that she was drinking alcohol and partying while her children were starving,' said prosecutor Catherine Wilson.

'We're not asking to walk away scot-free,' said defense attorney Kenneth Bell. 'We're not asking to be released today. What she is asking is, in lieu of 99 years to life, to have the ability to be rehabilitated.'

McClintick could have faced life in prison, but jurors sentenced her to 20 years.
