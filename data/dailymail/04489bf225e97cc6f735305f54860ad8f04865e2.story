Sacrifices: Cecil Bray, 82, in the wheelchair, who was today handed back his inheritance after his aunt decided to give it all to her window cleaner

A elderly man who lost out on £300,000 after his 'curmudgeonly' aunt left her entire fortune to a window cleaner has been handed back his inheritance by a judge.

Cecil Bray was at Julie Spalding's 'beck and call' after he gave up work to look after her in 1996, the High Court Heard.

He ran errands and organised her affairs as the increasingly capricious pensioner 'called the shots' around her home until she finally shut him out and changed her will.

Now, after a judge reversed Mrs Spalding's final will and testament, the window cleaner to whom she left her worldly possessions must pay it all back all back.

Mr Bray, now 82, had taken a retirement job as a driver, said Judge Murray Rosen QC, but he resigned to 'dedicate more time' to looking after her his aunt which became 'almost a full-time job'.

'In return she told him she would ‘compensate’ him by leaving him her bungalow in her will,' the judge explained.

'From that point onwards Mr Bray was effectively at her beck and call.'

Mrs Spalding drew up a will in 2003 which left the bulk of her cash and her home in Great North Way, Hendon, to her nephew - with the estate in total valued at more than £300,000.

But following a series of falls in 2005 she underwent a major personality change, after which Mr Bray was 'excommunicated from her life'. He was 'ordered out of her house', he told the court, soon after meeting her window cleaner, Albert Pearce, at her home in July of that year.

He had no memory of a previous meeting, said the judge, who added that 'any previous encounter with Mr Pearce would have been as his aunt’s window cleaner'.

From that point onward, Mr Pearce, himself now 80, became an increasingly important figure in Mrs Spalding’s life. Mr Bray, meanwhile, was forced to recede into the background by his own failing health.

Although for many years he had thought of himself as her 'favourite nephew', his close family 'urged him to avoid contact with her due to the stress involved'.

When she died in 2008, aged 98, she left Mr Pearce everything.

Mrs Spalding was described in court as a 'fiercely independent and indeed difficult woman', but with a great love of animals and enduring Jewish faith.

'Mr Bray reckoned that, at any one time, she had only been on speaking terms with 10 to 15 percent of her family,' said the judge.

The case reached court as Mr Bray, who came out of hospital in a wheelchair to testify, challenged the validity of his aunt’s last three wills.

His barrister, Constance McDonnell, claimed Mrs Spalding lacked the required 'testamentary capacity' to execute the series of disputed wills, the last of which she signed the year before she died.

It was also Mr Bray’s case that Mr Pearce, Mrs Spalding's sole beneficiary, 'procured the wills by undue influence'- a claim which the judge ultimately rejected.

Out of luck: Window cleaner Albert Pearce, who was the sole beneficiary of Julie Spalding's final will, must now pay Mr Bray back the entire £300,000 legacy after a judge ruled she should have kept her earlier promises

Mr Pearce insisted he had never been interested in Mrs Spalding’s money and that he had always done his best to care for her.

There was no evidence of 'coercion' on the window cleaner’s part, said the judge, who also rejected claims that Mr Pearce was 'cavalier' in his care of Mrs Spalding in the last months of her life.

However, he ruled that Mrs Spalding had 'expressly agreed' that she would leave her house to Mr Bray when she died and, given all her nephew had done for her, it was right to hold her to her promise.

Stripping Mr Pearce of his inheritance, Judge Rosen ruled Mrs Spalding lacked the mental capacity to make all of her final three wills and found in favour of the 2003 document, which left Mr Bray all but £14,000 of her estate.

'Mr Pearce will now have to repay all he has received from Mrs Spalding’s estate,' the judge concluded.
