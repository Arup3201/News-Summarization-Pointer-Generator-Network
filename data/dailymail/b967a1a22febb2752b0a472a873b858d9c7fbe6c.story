Alastair Cook has slammed the ECB for the timing of his dismissal as one-day captain, claiming the World Cup shambles which followed has shattered the players' confidence.

Cook's forthright views increase the pressure on head coach Peter Moores and managing director Paul Downton on the day the Test squad to tour West Indies was announced.

Speaking in Abu Dhabi, where he is preparing to play for the MCC, Cook said defeats by Australia and New Zealand proved that the decision to axe him was, with hindsight, incorrect.

Cook believes hindsight has proved the ECB wrong to remove him as captain before the tournament

Cook told The Daily Telegraph: 'I can't speak about what's gone on there in depth, but you always back yourself, and I would have loved to have had the opportunity that was taken away from me.

'The selectors made that decision because they thought it was the best for English cricket. Hindsight has probably proved them wrong, but now it's very easy to say that.'

He added: 'I wouldn't say all of it [confidence] has been [shattered], but a hell of a lot of it has been. You have to remember that it is a different format and you get a change, but all teams are grouped under the same English cricket umbrella, and we can't be naive enough to think that it's not.

'We have a repairing job to do, and the only way of doing that is by playing some good cricket and start winning.

'We built that momentum a little bit after the Ashes 14 or 15 months ago with a slightly younger side, including the likes of Gary Ballance and Joe Root. There was a feel-good factor about the English game in the middle of August after the Test matches. Since then, it's been tough going. We've got to rebuild again.'

Cook feels the ECB have highlighted the perils of changing captain so close to an international tournament

Cook would have loved the opportunity to complete a challenge he was set when named Andrew Strauss' successor as ODI captain after the previous World Cup in 2011.

'I was there for three-and-a-half years trying to do a job,' he said.

'We got to No 1 in the world with a full-strength side and got to the final of the Champions Trophy. There were things I can be very proud of.

'As any captain will tell you, leading your country in a World Cup is a huge honour and one that can never be taken lightly. I was very much looking forward to that.

'I understand the pressure I was under. I wasn't scoring the runs I should, or could have been scoring so I understand that my position was in jeopardy.

'But I think you saw in Australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to the tournament.

Cook believes that England would have made it out of their group at the World Cup if he had been there

'I don't know what's gone on on that tour ... but it did look like the lads were shell-shocked from the first two games.

'Whether I would have made a difference, I don't know.

'But I was fully confident we would get out of our group.'
