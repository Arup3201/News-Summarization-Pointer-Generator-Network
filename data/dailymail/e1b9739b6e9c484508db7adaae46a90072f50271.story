A nine-year-old boy accused of accidentally shooting a classmate has apologised to the girl he critically wounded as she left the hospital, finally able to walk.

Third-grader Amina Kocer-Bowman, eight, had five surgeries after the February 22 shooting that shattered her elbow and ripped through internal organs.

'I’m sorry I hurt you because I brought a gun to school,' a letter from her remorseful classmate reads.

'I made a bad choice. I was sad, scared and afraid, and I did not solve my problem well. I 
will stay away from guns.'

Recovering: Amina Kocer-Bowman, center left, walks with her mother, Teri Bowman, amongst hospital security and reporters outside of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle on Tuesday - 12 days after the shooting

The boy took the .45-caliber handgun 
from a car glove box and brought it to Armin Jahr Elementary on February
22 in a backpack, authorities said. It fired when he dropped the 
backpack on a desk.

The bullet struck eight-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman, who was released on Tuesday afternoon from Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, Washington. 

Remorseful: The boy wrote a letter of apology to Amina in pencil on college-ruled paper, and said he was sorry he hurt her

'Dear Amina,

'I’m sorry I hurt you because I 
brought a gun to school. I did not mean for any one to get hurt. I wish 
no one got hurt.

I wish you were out of the hospital playing basketball 
and going back to school. I wish everyone was okay. I made a bad choice.

I was sad, scared and afraid and I did not solve my problem well. I 
will stay away from guns. I should have told a grown-up. I will promise 
to learn better ways to solve my problems. again I am sorry Amina.

    Sincerely    '[name redacted]'

She walked out of the hospital on her 
own. Her surgeon, D  Eileen Bulger, said Amina was doing well. Her 
father said the family was 'happy to have her with us'.

Written in pencil, on college-ruled looseleaf paper, the boy wrote of how he wished 'no one got hurt', and expressed 
regret for putting his classmate in danger, in the letter obtained by Fox.

'I wish you were out of the hospital playing basketball 
and going back to school. I wish everyone was okay.

'I should have told a grown-up,' read the brief letter.

The Kitsap County prosecutor initially
charged the boy's mother, Jamie Lee Chaffin, and her boyfriend, Douglas
L Bauer, with unlawful possession of a firearm.

Third-degree assault 
charges were later added. If convicted of the felony, Chaffin and Bauer 
could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.

Chaffin, 34, is charged with two 
counts of unlawful possession of a firearm - one for allegedly having a 
gun in her home as a convicted felon and the second for allowing her son
access to a gun. Bauer, 50, is charged with one count of allowing 
access.

Chaffin and Bauer have both pleaded not guilty.

Accused: The nine-year-old boy accused of accidentally shooting a classmate at a Bremerton, Washington elementary school is led away after his juvenile detention hearing in Kitsap County, on February 23

Consequences: The boy appeared in court, supported by his uncle and father, facing charges of shooting a classmate with a handgun he had brought in his backpack

Emergency: A police officer stands watch by the entrance to Armin Jahr Elementary School in Washington, where eight-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman was shot when a gun discharged inside a boy's backpack

Distraught: Savannah Anderson, 13, hugs her little sister Kaylee, 10, after arriving in the school's gymnasium to take her home after the shooting

Probe: The third-grade boy who allegedly brought the gun into school is being held at a juvenile detention centre on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm and third-degree assault

The boy was visiting his mother, who does not have custody, when he took the handgun, which belongs to Bauer, authorities said.

The boy was reportedly planning on 
running away and took the gun for protection. He pleaded guilty this 
month to reckless endangerment and was sentenced to probation and 
counselling.

He is expected to testify in the case against his mother.
