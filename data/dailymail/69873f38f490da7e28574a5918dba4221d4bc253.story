Everton enjoyed their first European night since 2009, seeing off German side Wolfsburg 4-1 at Goodison Park.

A Ricardo Rodriguez own goal set Roberto Martinez's side on their way, before full backs Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines each scored.

Kevin Mirallas added a fourth late on after being put through by Samuel Eto'o as Martinez was given the perfect welcome to European football, and not even a brilliant stoppage-time Rodriguez free kick could dampen the high spirits at Goodison Park.

Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein was there and rates the Everton players' performances below.

Tim Howard 7.5 

Not quite his USA World Cup heroics but an obstinate barrier nonetheless with a particularly fine diving stop from Luis Gustavo.

Seamus Coleman 7.5 

Had the legs to face up to the challenge of facing former Chelsea winger Kevin De Bruyne, and even popped up in the opposition penalty area to nod Everton'a second.

John Stones 6.5 

Been quite a season for the England new-boy and this was another no-nonsense display belying his years.

Phil Jagielka 6.5 

Captain led by example, constantly encouraging and digging out colleagues. Not in his best form bit certainly not hiding.

Leighton Baines 8 

There is no finer sight than Baines roaring forward from left-back. His surge and supply to Naismith led to the opening goal and as usual he made no mistake from the spot for number three. Star man.

Gareth Barry 6 

Just his presence is reassuring for Roberto Martinez given his experience. Provided the security so Baines and Coleman could bomb forward.

James McCarthy 6 

Ditto Barry. Didn't try anything spectacular but that is what Martinez wants, covered the hard yards to help keep Wolfsburg out.

Aiden McGeady 6 

Technically gifted, it was one of those evenings where a lot of his best work went unrewarded until he was fouled outside the area - and the referee awarded a penalty!

Steven Naismith 7.5 

On Scottish referendum day, it was almost inevitable he should have a stormer. The Everton faithful chanted his name after his shot led to Ricardo Rodriguez's own goal.

Kevin Mirallas 5.5 One of four Belgians on show but it didn't inspire him. Ran down too many blind alleys. Booked but did partially redeem himself by scoring a well-taken late fourth.

Romelu Lukaku 6 

It's not quite happening for the £28million striker. Had a wild slash into the sidenetting with a decent chance and failed when he took a free-kick in Leighton Baines territory. 

Romelu Lukaku was unable to produce his best play but worked hard as Everton's target man

Subs:

Samuel Eto'o (for Lukaku 69) 6 

Multiple Champions League winner worked hard enough while slumming it in the Europa League.

Darron Gibson (for Steven Naismith 82) 

Manager: Roberto Martinez 7.5 

Will be delighted with his own European debut. Put Wolfsburg away with attacking intent.
