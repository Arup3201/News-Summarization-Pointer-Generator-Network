Boris Johnson feels he would be well-placed to lead the renegotiation of Britain's membership of the European Union, it was claimed yesterday.

If the Conservatives win a second term, it is expected that Mr Johnson would be a cabinet minister when they deliver the promised in-out referendum, by the end of 2017.

As a journalist based in Brussels in the early 1990s, he has revealed he would like to use his knowledge of EU politics in the talks, and has 'strong views' about what Britain should push for.

Mr Johnson insisted he could not take on the responsibility because he will be London Mayor until next year, but it will fuel speculation he is looking for some role in the future EU talks.

He is set to return to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the General Election on May 7, and would be a front-runner in any future battle for the Tory leadership.

Pushing for a role in Brussels could put him on a collision course with chancellor George Osborne who is understood to be positioning himself for a move to the Foreign Office after the election.

The Mayor, who was on a week-long tour of the US last week, has also revealed he will renounce his dual American citizenship, which he was entitled to when he was born in New York.

This will be widely seen as clearing a possible hurdle in running for the leadership of his party, whether it comes up after the election or at some point in a second term of Tory government.

It will also help him avoid future tax bills from the US authorities, after recently settling a capital gains tax bill in the US on the sale of his London home, said to have been around £30,000.

If Mr Cameron continues as Prime Minister after the General Election, Mr Johnson is widely tipped non-departmental cabinet role, such as party chairman, until his term as Mayor ends in May 2016

If Mr Cameron continues as Prime Minister after the General Election, Mr Johnson is widely tipped non-departmental cabinet role, such as party chairman, until his term as Mayor ends in May 2016.

But his surprise new ambition to drive a hard bargain for Britain in the EU was only revealed by sources close to him this weekend. One said he saw himself as a 'lead negotiator' and would ask for the job if it were not for his Mayoral duties.

Speaking on his US trip, Mr Johnson said: 'I have strong views about how a renegotiation could happen. I'd be very happy to help. I think there's a deal to be done. If I wasn't happily lashed to my oar as mayor of London, I would do it.'

A source told the Sunday Times: 'Boris could usefully offer informal advice about how to do it. He knows the scene very well. If he wasn't mayor, he would put himself forward.'

On the trip, he met presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, congressmen and senators, who he said had urged Mr Cameron to keep defence spending at 2pc of GDP in a future government.

This spending commitment has not yet been promised, but Mr Johnson said the message from his US counterparts is that 'they certainly want to see that'.

It is his second foreign trip since the start of the year, having already visited Kurdistan to meet British service personnel training up the local Peshmerga forces fighting Islamic State. He said the trip was to drum up investment for London, but it will also burnish his credentials as an international statesman.

Mr Johnson said in 2013 that Britain should be prepared to 'walk away' from Europe if the Prime Ministers fails to negotiate a good deal. He has also backed calls to hold the referendum as soon as possible – as early as next year.

He said this week: 'Let's get it done and knock it on the head and do it for the good of Europe. The whole Eurozone is mired in low growth, low productivity, they have a very-anti-competitive environment there.' While he said there was 'huge support' for change in the EU, he said he believed the UK would vote to stay in a 'reformed Europe'
