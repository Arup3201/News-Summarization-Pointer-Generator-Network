Message: Michael Adebolajo thanked police for shooting him and told them he killed Lee Rigby 'for my God', the prosecution said

One of the Muslim converts accused of murdering Lee Rigby thanked police for shooting him and said 'I wish the bullets had killed me' as he was given first aid, the Old Bailey heard today.

Jurors were shown footage of 
Michael Adebolajo, 28, and his accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, being gunned down by
 armed police when the defendants tried to attack them.

Minutes earlier they had 'mutilated, almost decapitated and murdered' Lee Rigby, 25, after they had ambushed him outside military barracks in
 Woolwich, South East London, the Old Bailey heard.

Adebolajo is seen to fly across the road as shots are fired at him and received a gunshot wound to his upper left bicep.

The
 court heard as he lay in the road he said to paramedics: 'Please let me
 lay here, I don't want anyone to die, I just want the soldiers out of 
my country.

'Your government is wrong, I did it for my God. I wish the bullets had killed me so I can join my friends and family.'

Adebolajo
 later told officers: 'I am a Muslim extremist, this may be the only 
chance you meet one. Your people have gone to Afghanistan and raped and 
killed our women. I am seeking retribution I wouldn't stoop so low as to
 rape and kill women.

'I thank the person who shot me, because it is what
 Allah would have wanted.'

Adebolajo added: 'I love Allah more than my children.'

At
 hospital he told doctors he did not want to be touched by any women. He
 made no reply to being arrested on suspicion of murder.

The
 following day Adebolajo told another officer: 'My intention was never 
to harm civilians. There were women and children around. My intention 
was to hurt military only.'

He
 added: 'The reason that we are fighting is because we believe in an eye
 for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. We hope that one day Great Britain 
will replace those corrupt politicians with men, or women, who truly 
care about the security of their citizens by withdrawing from affairs of
 Muslims, including their lands.'

Aftermath: The two men accused of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, Michael Adebolajo (right) and Michael Adebowale (second right) spoke to witnesses and said they were 'fighting Allah's enemies', the jury heard

Death: Lee Rigby was allegedly run down in the street and hacked to death in south-east London in May

A number of women went to the scene to comfort the soldier, the jury heard

One of the women was Amanda Donnelly Martin, who was with her daughter.

Prosecutor Richard Whittam said he was 
'saying things about religion such as 'these soldiers go to our land, 
kill/bomb our people - so an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth'.

It said: 'Fighting Allah's enemies is
 an obligation', and went on: 'Do not spend your days in endless 
discussion with the cowardly and foolish. It means that it will delay 
your meeting Allah's enemies on the battlefield. Sometimes the cowardly 
and foolish can be those dearest to you. So be prepared to turn away 
from them.'

Case: The two suspects sit listening to the prosecution along with Justice Sweeney and the jury at the start of their murder trial today

The court heard that Adebolajo handed a letter containing religious references to Ms Donnelly Martin.

The handwritten note suggested 'carnage reaching your town' was 'simply retaliation for your oppression in our towns'.

It
 said when the 'heat of battle' came, 'it is unlikely that any of your 
so-called politicians will be caught up in the the crossfire, so I 
suggest that you remove them.'

The
 letter continued: 'Muslims will trade with you on fair terms. 
Understand that the days of your international armed robbery are drawing
 to a close.'

Jurors 
were also shown a video clip of Adebolajo speaking with blood on his 
hands, suggesting that the attack was 'an eye for an eye'.

Before Adebolajo, 28, and his 
accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, right, were gunned down by armed 
officers, jurors were told he passed a handwritten note to a bystander.

It
 read: 'To my beloved children know that to fight Allah's enemies is an 
obligation. The proofs of which are so numerous that but a handful of 
any of them cuts out the bewitching tongues of the Munafiqeen.

'Do
 not spend your days in endless dispute with the cowardly and foolish if
 it means it will delay you meeting Allah's enemies on the battlefield.

'Sometimes the cowardly and foolish could be those dearest to you so be prepared to turn away from them.

'When you set out on this path do not look left or right.

'Seek
 Shaheedala oh my sons so that you might be raised together and if its 
Allah's decree that you are not to be in the hearts of green birds.

'Then
 be ready for to enter the University of Joosuf. Sijn. Be patient there 
and be firm there and inshallah you will meet your Lord with him pleased
 with you.

'Verily Allah is with those who are patient.

'If I live beyond this day and you find me talking other than this then know that perhaps Allah has left me to stray.

'If
 you find yourself curious as to why carnage is reaching your own towns 
then know its simply retaliation for your oppression in our towns.

'Many of your people are aristocrats that directly benefit from invasion of our lands without material loss.

'Whereas the average Joe Bloggs working class man loses his sons when they are killed by our brothers.

'When
 the heat of battle reaches YOUR local street its unlikely that any of 
your so called politicians will be at risk or caught in the crossfire so
 I suggest you remove them.

'Remove
 them and replace them with people who will secure your safety by the 
immediate withdrawal from the affairs of the Muslims.

'Muslims
 will trade with you on fair terms but understand that the days of your 
international armed robbery is drawing to a close.

'To humble yourselves willingly is better for you.

'May Allah guide your nation to the truth'.
