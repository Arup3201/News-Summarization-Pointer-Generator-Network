The Met Office issued a severe weather alert from tomorrow across the South, South-East and south Midlands for up to 40mm of rain - two weeks’ worth - fanning flood worries.

Forecasters said wet snow threatens the North Downs, South Downs, Chilterns, Cotswolds, Salisbury Plain, Exmoor and Dartmoor, with slushy deposits possible.

Monday will be the coldest November 5 
since daily temperature records began in 1999, Met Office data passed to
 Reading University meteorology expert Dr Roger Brugge showed.

 evening and feeling near-freezing due to bitter northerly breezes.

Snow
 fell in the Pennines for the first time this winter today and areas in 
County Durham were dusted white in a reminder of what could be a tough 
few months ahead.

Temperatures fell below freezing as far south as London, the Met Office said, with nights set to continue at sub-zero levels in the North.

The Weather Channel forecast lows in Scotland down to -8C - which would be the coldest this winter.

Arctic winds from Greenland are delivering bitter temperatures and showers, but also sunshine.

The Weather Channel said temperatures are up to 5C below normal.

Meanwhile, an 18-year-old youth who 
died when the Porsche sports car he was driving was involved in a 
Hallowe'en smash in stormy weather was named today as Tom Chubb, the son
 of East Devon district councillor Iain Chubb.

Tom was fatally injured when his 
black Porsche was in collision with a white Peugeot van at Trill, near 
Musbury, as torrential rain and strong winds swept southern England on 
Wednesday night.

His father is a Conservative who represents the Newbridges ward and lives with his wife Eve at Abbey Gate, Axminster.

You were such a kind-hearted person 
who didn't have a bad word to say about anyone. You didn't deserve this.
 We love and miss you - sleep tight.'

Hurricane Sandy kick-started Britain’s early winter chill by strengthening mid-Atlantic high pressure blocking mild south-westerly winds as Arctic air plunges south instead, MeteoGroup and The Weather Channel said.

Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: 'We’ve already had wintry showers this week and temperatures are staying slightly below normal.

'Low pressure moving east early Sunday will bring 15-25mm of rain in parts of the South and an isolated 40mm on higher ground.

'Wet snow or sleet could fall over higher ground such as the North Downs, South Downs, Chilterns, Cotswolds, Salisbury Plain, Exmoor and Dartmoor, with slushy temporary deposits.'

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams added: 'It feels rather cold, with day and night temperatures are slightly below average, with frost in places and an ice risk locally in England but mainly for Scotland.

'Our north-westerly flow is coming from Greenland and windchill is making temperatures feel colder.

'Unsettled is the best way to describe the next week - with showers and rain with a risk of snow over higher ground in the north and widespread UK frosts going into the weekend.

'It will be generally windy, with the risk of gales in exposed areas, and temperatures largely below average for the next 30 days.'
