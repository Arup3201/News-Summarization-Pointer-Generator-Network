The Bureau of Land Management may be attempting to take over private land in Texas, the state Attorney General warns.

The BLM, which oversees public land in the U.S., has reportedly been 'eyeing up'  90,000 acres of land on the Texas side of the Red River, which makes up the border between the state and Oklahoma.

This report echoes the recent standoff between a Nevada cattle rancher and the BLM which took place earlier this month.

The Bureau of Land Management has reportedly been looking to grab 90,000 acres of land on the banks of the Red River, which forms part of the border between Texas and Oklahoma

Texas’ Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott wrote in a letter to Neil Kornze, the director of the BLM, about his ‘deep concern’ that the Federal Government would lay claim to land along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River which had been owned by local families ‘for generations.’

'I am deeply concerned about reports that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is considering taking property in the State of Texas and that it now claims belongs to the federal government,’ Attorney General Abbott wrote in a letter obtained by FoxNews.

‘As Attorney General of Texas, I am deeply troubled by reports from BLM field hearings that the federal government may claim—for the first time—that 90,000 acres of territory along the Red River now belong to the federal government.’

The Attorney General further addresses his worry that the BLM has 'failed to disclose either its full intentions or the legal justification for its proposed actions.'

However, the BLM said in a statement to FoxNews that it is 'categorically not expanding Federal holdings along the Red River'.

Local farmers are worried that the 
BLM is looking to use a 1986 federal court case which determined that 
140-acres of bank-side land along the Red River no longer belonged to a Texas landowner after the water moved.

The
 Supreme Court incorporated the Red River as part of the Texas border 
with Oklahoma nearly a century ago, and as the river moves, so does the 
border and the definition of what is federal land.

The Texas case comes shortly after that of Cliven Bundy, 67, and his standoff with federal land managers in Nevada.

The battle began in 1993 when Bundy 
stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze 
public lands which he claims has been in his family for more than 140 years.

The
 state disagrees, and the dispute culminated in an armed standoff when 
more than 200 armed federal agents and snipers were deployed to forcibly
 remove Bundy's cattle earlier this month.

Violent: A federal officer is seen firing a taser gun at Cliven Bundy's son Ammon Bundy as an aggressive police dog goes after him

However,
 they were met by a militia hundreds of 'Bundy supporters', some 
carrying automatic weapons and sniper rifles and threatening violence, 
and were forced to retreat.

The
 Bureau of Land 
Management later released several hundred cows they had seized but the 
Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, has said a federal taskforce 
is being setup to deal with Bundy, who reportedly owes the government 
$1million in unpaid grazing fees.

Last week Senator Reid branded Bundy and his supporters 'domestic terrorists' who do not respect America.

According
 to the Las Vegas Journal-Review, the Senate Majority Leader said: 
'They’re nothing more than domestic terrorists. I repeat: what happened 
there was domestic terrorism.'

'Cliven
 Bundy does not recognize the United States. The United States, he says,
 is a foreign government. He doesn’t pay his taxes. He doesn’t pay his 
fees. And he doesn’t follow the law.'
