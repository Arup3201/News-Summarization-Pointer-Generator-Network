Photographs of women working under a strict regime in a hijab factory feared to be run by terror group Isis have emerged on a new blog post.

The images show women decked in black from head to toe tailoring and stitching hijabs, while children play around them. 

Under the title 'The name of God and merciful', the blog was posted by the ‘Information Office of the Mandate of Nineveh’ - the same organisation which distributed pictures of public executions carried out by the militant organisation.

Worker: A woman is covered from head to toe in black as she stitches hijabs in the factory

Innocent: Two young children smile for the camera as they try on hijabs and abayas within the factory. Normally in Islam only women who have reached puberty are expected to cover their bodies

It is understood that the factory is based in the Nineveh Province in northern Iraq, which has been subject to attacks from the terrorist group ISIS.  

Captions in the pictures, written in Arabic, describe the 'shaping and tailoring of Islamic veils in one of the Islamic State factories'. 

Later, they describe 'Preparing Islamic veils for distribution to Muslims'. 

Package: The unidentifiable women put the hijabs in plastic bags ready for distribution. Under Sharia law women must wear a hijab, niqab, a cloak and gloves to cover every part of their body

Inside: A montage of images from inside a hijab factory, believed to be run by terror group Isis

Since it was uploaded on January 30, the latest blog has attracted more than 10,000 hits worldwide and been shared on social media sites. 

The workers are pictured at work stations using black cloth to stitching together hijabs, the Islamic dress for women which covers the head and chest to protect their modesty.

The garments are stacked high on tables and wrapped in plastic bags, ready for distribution,

In one of the pictures, a young boy can be seen excitedly shouting as the women around him continue to work. 

Play: A young boy gestures excitedly while rows of women stitch the hijabs, to be handed out to others to cover their heads and chests

Work: Women and their children form a queue as two men hand them bags

Piled high: A picture of the black garments in bag outside the factory were posted on the website

In separate images, the women are seen queuing outside the doors of the warehouse with children, as men hand them more black clothing.

In Arabic, a title at the top of the webpage reads: ‘Illustrated report on sewing and distribution of legitimate veil on Muslim women’. 

As Isis has taken over swathes of territory across Iraq and Syria it has imposed Sharia law on citizens, which insists women must be fully clothed wearing hijabs, a niqab to cover their faces, gloves and an abaya, or cloak.

The precise location of the factory is not known, but Nineveh was an ancient Mesopotamian city whose ruins now lie across the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.

Pile: Hijabs are stacked outside the building for women to distribute

Hijabs: The clothing is designed to protect the modesty of women, but is viewed by critics as a method of control

The city is now controlled by Isis after the group attacked stormed through in June 2014, as part of their campaign to create a new Islamic State. 

An earlier post by the Information Office of the Mandate of Nineveh showed photographs of a series of public executions by Isis terrorists.

They included men accused of being gay being thrown off high towers, a woman accused of adultery being stoned to death and others being crucified after being sentenced for ‘banditry’.

The International Business Times reported in January how Isis militants were believed to have executed five men, because their wives were not wearing hijabs properly.

The slaughter happened is Mosul, a stronghold for the terror group in northern Iraq.

Additional reports suggest the extremists had set up road blocks in regions under their control to inspect women and make sure they were dressed according to Sharia Law.
