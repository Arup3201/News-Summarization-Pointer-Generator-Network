A company is charging people more than $200,000 to be frozen after they die, and the chance to be brought back to life by future technologies.

Although the American company is quite open about the fact that there is no known way to revive the bodies, they sell this service based on the fact that future generations may have the answer.

In 1990 Roy Schiavello from Melbourne died at age 30 while on the operating table. He was transported to the US.

He was being operated for a brain tumor, he became Australia's first cryonic patient and is now being stored in Alcor's facilities until the technology to revive him is discovered.

The process they use is called cyronic preservation, it is similar to the one used to preserve blood cells, embyros, sperm and stem cells.

British-Australian comedian Ugly Dave Gray is one of the many Aussies who have put their hand up for the unusual scientific process.

He has spoken openly about his curiosity about the future fuelling his desire to be revived in the future.

Alcor Life Extension is the world’s largest cryonics company, and according its CEO Max More, they’re signing up customers from all over the world who want their bodies preserved when they die.

'The premise for cryopreservation is simple', Rose Eveleth told Science Alert.

'Cryopreservation can be thought of as the natural progression of this desire to keep someone alive using whatever means possible. Cryonics is the same thing, said Ms Eveleth, 'we just have to stop them from getting worse and let a more advanced technology in the future fix that problem.'

The technology to bring back a person from their frozen state because the technology to revive them does not exist yet.

The icey price of freezing your brain is $80,000 and to preserve your whole body it will cost up to $200,000.

Once an Alcor client has been officially declared dead, they begin the preservation process by moving body to an ice bed and cover them in a loose, slushy layer of ice.

A device called a 'heart-lung resuscitator’ is used to get the blood pumping through the body again, and medication is applied to the body to prevent the cells from deteriorating.

Next as much blood and bodily fluids are drained, then they are replaced with a solution like antifreeze.

Major blood vessels are then flushed of any blood then they are swabbed with the antifreeze solution.

The antifreeze solution is used so that ice crystals do not form and damage any cells.

The body is then cooled down to about 0.5 degrees celsius every hour until the final temperature of -195 degrees celciusis achieved over three weeks then the frozen body is stored.
