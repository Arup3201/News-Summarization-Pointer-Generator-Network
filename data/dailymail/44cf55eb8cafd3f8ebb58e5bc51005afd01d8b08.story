Ask a football fan who the greatest player in the world right now is, and they will more than likely fire back at you one of two names.

Since 2008, the official world's greatest player prizes have been a two-horse race between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

But for how long can the duo dominate at the top before a young upstart takes their place? It could be sooner than you think as a certain Neymar is already exceeding the game's dominant duo at international level.

With just 59 caps, Neymar already has 42 goals to his name as he looks to continue his rapid rise

The Barcelona forward scored twice in Brazil's 4-0 win in Turkey on Wednesday, taking his international tally to 42 goals in just 59 international games. 

To put that into perspective, Messi has just three more goals from 96 Argentina appearances, while Ronaldo's 51 goals have taken him 116 caps.

Luis Suarez has also scored 42 international goals - but even he has played 79 times for Uruguay.

Neymar (Brazil): 59 caps, 42 goals 

Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) 116, 51 

Lionel Messi (Argentina) 96, 45 

Luis Suarez (Uruguay) 79, 42

Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast) 104, 65

Wayne Rooney (England) 99, 43

While Messi is still the undisputed No 1 star at Barcelona, Neymar looks to already have the measure of his team-mate on the international stage.

It may have been the Argentine picking up the Golden Ball at this summer's World Cup finals, but the 27-year-old faded in the latter stages of the competition - to the point where his impact on matches was becoming minimal.

Neymar however was the stand-out star in a Brazil team who were in with a good chance of going all the way on home soil. The host nation had their weaknesses but with Neymar in their ranks they were unbeatable... Until he got injured.

Everyone knows what happened next as first Germany (7-1) then Holland (3-0) ripped in to Brazil to expose just how much the 22-year-old was carrying the international team.

Even the players knew it judging by the over-the-top reaction of bringing Neymar shirts and caps out before the ill-fated annihilation by Germany in the World Cup semi-final. 

Just to prove he wasn't riding on the crest of a wave, his return from injury for the team has resulted in five consecutive wins for Brazil - with Neymar scoring all four goals in a 4-0 win in Japan.

It's transforming to his club game too. After a steady first season at Barcelona, the forward now looks ready to kick on and take European football by storm. He's one goal ahead of Messi this term with 12 strikes.

Neymar only scored 13 for Barca in his first season following his high profile switch from Santos, but he now looks ready to hit the next level having settled in Europe.

Ronaldo's 24 goals makes the Portuguese still top dog in Spain, but Neymar's rapid progression cannot be ignored whether it's in a Brazil shirt or a Barcelona one. 

Following a steady first campaign in Europe, Neymar has kicked on in his second season at Barcelona as he started the year by outscoring Messi across all competitions

After another fine performance against Turkey, where he was applauded off by the home fans, the forward admitted he was in the form of his life but also fired out a warning to his rivals and detractors that he will only get better.

'I think so!' said Neymar. 'I’m very emotional. It’s another country, another stadium to keep in my heart. I didn’t expect this, I couldn’t be happier. But I always want more. I don’t want to remain at this level.'

For now the greatest player in the world debate still circles around Messi and Ronaldo, but the future is coming and it may arrive sooner than you think in the shape of Neymar if his international form is anything to go by.
