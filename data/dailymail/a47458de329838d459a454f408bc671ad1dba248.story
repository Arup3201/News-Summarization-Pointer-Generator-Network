Can foreign players ever recover from a slow start to life in English football? It is a question I have been asking myself since I was playing.

Every year, when a raft of new signings arrive from overseas, a saying is trotted out with great regularity that is used to mask underwhelming performances from individuals. You will be familiar with it: ‘Give them 12 months to settle in.’

The theory is that it takes each foreign import a year to get to grips with the frenzy of the Barclays Premier League but, once they have done, you will see their form going up and away. Where, though, is the evidence to support that?

Two individuals got me thinking about this, namely Angel di Maria and Mesut Ozil.

Let’s make the comparison with both men, first and foremost.

Both arrived here from Real Madrid, both cost astronomical fees and both men tend to operate in the same areas of the pitch.

They are both left-footed but prefer playing centrally.

Di Maria has scored three goals in five appearances since his £59.7million switch in August and will be the headline act at The Hawthorns on Monday night. 

He has looked every inch a superstar and no apologies have been needed with regard to his form.

Ozil, by contrast, finds himself enduring more frustrations this weekend. A ‘crack in his knee’ may rule him out for up to 12 weeks but, even when he returns to full fitness, I find it hard to see the German leaving his unconvincing efforts of last season behind.

Arsene Wenger made me think in April when the Arsenal manager made the bold claim that Ozil, his biggest ever signing at £42m, was ‘fantastic’ and he ‘would put him on the list to be player of the season next season’.

Wenger does not usually tend to be so assertive.

Even before he had a knee- ligament problem diagnosed while he was away with Germany, Ozil had not looked like delivering the same stylish displays of his time in Madrid.

Look back at all the great imports to the Barclays Premier League and you will realise they were operating at near-enough full throttle from a very early stage. Arsenal supporters should appreciate that more than most.

Take Dennis Bergkamp. It is a myth to say he did nothing in his first campaign at Highbury. 

Yes, it may have taken him six games to score his first goal but he added another 15 in 41 appearances, the last of which — an 84th-minute winner against Bolton in the final game — took Arsenal into Europe.

Thierry Henry was another. Did he need a settling-in period? If he did, it could be measured in weeks and nothing longer. 

Once he broke his duck in his eighth game, the goals flowed freely. He finished the 1999-2000 season with a haul of 26, including one sequence when he scored nine in eight matches.

Keep thinking of names and you will see a pattern emerging. Didier Drogba? Helped lead Chelsea to the title and the League Cup in his first season with 16 goals; Gianfranco Zola arrived at Stamford Bridge in November 1996 and, by May 1997, the Football Writers had named him Player of the Year. 

Jurgen Klinsmann won player of the year in his first season and Eric Cantona won the League in his first season at Manchester United.

Cristiano Ronaldo may have been too eager to try tricks and go down too easily when he initially joined Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon, but anyone who didn’t believe he was going to the top straight away was a fool.

From a personal point of view, the best foreigners I worked alongside — Sami Hyypia, Xabi Alonso, Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez to name a few — were all contributing in their opening weeks and months. You could see at Melwood with how they trained and prepared there would be no issues.

The player who forced me to think again was Robert Pires. I didn’t rate him immediately but then, in season two, he took off and was sensational. Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra were slow starters at Manchester United but they joined in January, only played 11 games each and had found their true form by the start of the next campaign. 

Gianfranco Zola arrived in November 1996 and, by May 1997, he had an individual award to his name

Ozil played at the top level in Spain with Real Madrid, but hasn't replicated his form consistently in England

That’s why I was so interested in Wenger’s comments about Ozil coming to the fore, as I just hadn’t seen any evidence to support that before he got injured.

I remain sceptical that he will have such an influence when he returns, too.

If you don’t adapt to this league early, the likelihood is you never will. Andriy Shevchenko and Juan Sebastian Veron are fine examples of men who arrived as giants — they were stars of Serie A — but never recovered from those teething problems. 

It’s why I look at Tottenham, who travel to Manchester City on Saturday afternoon, and wonder how it will end for the men who arrived 12 months ago, during the record-breaking transfer of Gareth Bale (someone else who has had no issues with a new league in his first season) to Real Madrid. 

Eric Cantona (left) helped United to the title in 1993 and went on to become their star player, while Klinsmann also had a fantastic start to life in the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur

Di Maria has replicated the form he left Real Madrid with in the Premier League, scoring three goals

Thierry Henry (left) took eight games to score but ended the season with 26; Dennis Bergkamp (right) became an Arsenal great and had a fine season despite taking his time to score his first goal after his move

Of all the players who arrived during that £100m spree, only Christian Eriksen looked good. But with Roberto Soldado, Paulinho and Erik Lamela you can never see it turning, irrespective of Spurs paying a fortune to sign them. They are not the first and won’t be the last. 

Liverpool will also be hoping their new foreign stars start to perform in the next few months or they will be in the same situation.

Should a player get in rhythm straight away, however, the signs can only be positive. That is why Di Maria and Diego Costa won’t fizzle out after their flash starts. They have set a classy tone.

Juan Sebastian Veron is a fine example of a player never getting used to the demands of the Premier League

Barkley should head to U21 finals

There has been plenty of talk of full internationals joining the Under 21s in the summer after Gareth Southgate and his squad qualified for the European Championship.

Arsene Wenger and Roberto Martinez have already come out and stated it wouldn’t be beneficial to their players to play and that’s no surprise as they will always look after their clubs’ interests rather than the national team’s.

That is a big problem in this country. My view is it’s not a black-and-white case.

Fully fledged regulars for club and country — like Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling — would benefit from a free summer.

But for players like Calum Chambers, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw and John Stones — squad players at the moment for the seniors, who won’t play 40-50 games this season — it would benefit them and the squad.

That sort of tournament experience could be vital for the senior European Championship in 2016.

This week I'm looking forward to...

...seeing how Younes Kaboul performs on Saturday afternoon. The Spurs defender was involved in the embarrassing 6-0 defeat at Manchester City last season, in a game which was the beginning of the end for Andre Villas-Boas.

Now Kaboul returns to the Etihad, this time as Tottenham captain.

A lot of people were surprised that he was given the armband by Mauricio Pochettino but he was excellent in the last away game, the 1-1 draw at Arsenal.

The Frenchman has pace and power but lapses of concentration have cost him in the past. He cannot afford any slip-ups against one of the world’s best — Sergio Aguero — on Saturday.

Gianfranco Zola, Eric Cantona, Didier Drogba and Jurgen Klinsmann all got used to the Premier League quickly, winning trophies and player awards

Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp took weeks, not months, to get going

Foreign players tend to have a terrific start, like Diego Costa has, or struggle to gain any form after teething problems, like Andriy Shevchenko

Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling could do with a summer off

But the likes of Calum Chambers and Ross Barkley should play for England in the 2015 Under 21 European Championship
