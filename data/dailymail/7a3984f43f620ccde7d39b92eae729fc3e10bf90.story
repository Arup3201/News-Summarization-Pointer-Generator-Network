They are nature’s fair-weather tourists.

Following the summer heatwave and mild autumn, Britain has seen a huge influx of exotic moths and butterflies from North Africa and the Continent.

Not only are the colourful species making the sea crossing in a record numbers, but some seem destined to overwinter on our shores, a feat that has not occurred in years.

Exotic butterflies and moths from the continent have begun to colonise Britain following the heatwave, experts have said. The largest of the underwing moths, the Clifden Nonpareil (pictured) sports a striking blue wing flash to ward off predators

It is also the first time the European Long-tailed Blue has raised broods at sites across the south coast, with the butterflies spotted from Dorset to Kent.

A surge in sightings of rare moths, including the Clifden Nonpareil and Rosy Underwing, across several southern counties suggests they could be colonising our shores.

‘These sightings suggest that all 
three species may be attempting to colonise southern England,’ said 
Richard Fox, of the Butterfly Conservation Charity.

‘It
 is very exciting news, not only for the people lucky enough to see 
these thrilling butterflies and moths in the wild but also for the 
future.

Increasing numbers of the rare migrants are believed to have been drawn to the UK by the spell of hot summer weather and warm autumn temperatures. A Crimson Speckled moth is pictured

‘There is excitement over the breeding and colonisation by species that haven’t overwintered here before or certainly not for a long time.

‘The hot summer enabled Long-tailed 
Blues and other migratory butterflies to spread northwards into Britain,
 capitalising on opportunities to breed here while the weather remains 
warm.

‘This species 
probably won’t survive the forthcoming winter, but it seems likely that 
the stunning Clifden Nonpareil and possible even the Rosy Underwing, 
have already established footholds in southern England.

‘And that’s all set against the backdrop of a major migration of moths, which includes the Vestal and Death’s-head Hawkmoth.’

Conservationists claim this autumn has
 seen the largest influx of Vestal moths for more than 50 years, with 
the insects spotted as far north as Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Higher
 than average numbers of the exotic Crimson Speckled moth, which is 
usually found in North Africa and Southern Europe, have also been 
recorded.

‘We get an 
annual autumn immigration from hotter parts of Europe, but this is just a
 bumper year. For some of these species this is their best ever arrival 
in to Britain,’ said Mr Fox.

‘Immigration happens right across the south coast, with some moths and butterflies using the warm currents to fly hundreds of miles to make the trip. Some are certainly coming from Mediterranean if not North Africa.’

Dorset County Moth Recorder Les Hill has seen three separate Clifden Nonpareil moths in the past two weeks in the same part of south Dorset.

‘It is one of the most charismatic of British moth fauna and is on every moth recorders’ ‘wish list’,’ he said.

‘As the name nonpareil states, it is peerless and has no equal. To record one in a lifetime is the fulfilment of an ambition; to record them every year in my garden is just remarkable.’
