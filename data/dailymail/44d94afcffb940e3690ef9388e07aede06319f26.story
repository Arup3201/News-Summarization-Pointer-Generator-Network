Neil Warnock plans to be more boring in the future to avoid any further Football Association raps.

The Crystal Palace boss was fined £9,000 for comments he made about referee Craig Pawson following his side's defeat at Chelsea last month.

The 65-year-old had a personal hearing on Wednesday after denying the charges after saying that Pawson had been 'influenced' by Chelsea players to send off Damien Delaney shortly after the Blues had seen Cesar Azpilicueta dismissed.

Warnock, who has not seen his side win since a 2-0 victory over Leicester on September 27, was also warned as to his future conduct and intends to steer clear of saying anything of note any time soon.

"I'm going to be boring from now on," he said.

"(I will) Give you nothing to write about. I know journalists appreciate my comments, but they are not the ones who pay the fines.

"The media is part of my job and I have a lot of acquaintances who are journalists and I know how hard they work, so I will always come out and do press conferences.

"You just have to learn about the timing of things with the TV. Twenty minutes after a game is very soon so you have to get your thoughts together."

Warnock's comments were made after Crystal Palace's 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in October

Warnock could have fallen foul of the FA for questioning decisions in the two matches either side of the Chelsea defeat, with the loss at Hull and a 2-2 draw at West Brom also seeing him question certain decisions.

He then saw Palace lose 3-1 at home to Sunderland on Monday night in a game where the Eagles were denied at least one clear penalty.

The former Sheffield United and Leeds boss reined in his comments following the defeat as he struggles to work out what would constitute an FA charge, having seen Swansea's Garry Monk avoid a fine for his remarks after a soft penalty was awarded in their game at Stoke. 

"You have to watch what you say otherwise you are going to get fined," he added.

"What I said, I could have changed maybe two or three words and I wouldn't have got charged.

"My wife, for example, saw the Garry Monk thing and said, 'Don't you ever do anything like that or I will be mad at you'. I told her this week, 'But he didn't get charged, darling!"'

Warnock takes Palace to Old Trafford on Saturday looking to move away from the relegation zone with a victory against a Manchester United side that is also in desperate need of points.
