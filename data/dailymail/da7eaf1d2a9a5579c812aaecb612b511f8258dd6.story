Police are searching for a Massachusetts mother who is thought to have kidnapped her five children, preventing authorities from treating her 2-month old daughter in need of medical care.

Yurong Wu, 41, of Quincy, is wanted for parental kidnapping and child endangerment, and is believed to have fled to New York City before losing custody of her children to the state last week.

She is believed to have taken her children Yu Fan Mei, 10, Kelly Mei, 8, Kethy Mei, 6, Kate Mei, 2, and Kalen Mei, two months.

Department of Children and Families officials was given custody of the children last Wednesday after they could not find them at their home managed by the Quincy Housing Authority.

The youngest child is believed to have serious health issues and was in 'dire need' of treatment, police told CBS Boston.

The children's father Jackie Mei, 50, was arrested Friday and charged with child endangerment and misleading a investigation after allegedly being uncooperative with police.

He posted $1,500 bail and was released with a GPS device.

Court documents show the father saying that his wife turned off her phone and told him that she would take care of the children.

His lawyer says he does not speak English and does not know about the whereabouts of his wife or children.

Police in Massachusetts are working with New York City authorities to find the family.

The family has relatives in the metropolis and NYPD visited a house in Brooklyn on Monday night but did not find the children, Quincy Police spokesman Capt John Dougan told Daily Mail Online.

It is not believed Ms Wu wants to harm her children, and neighbors say she was concerned about losing custody of them this winter, according to the Patriot Ledger.

The mother and her children, who have no car, may have left weeks ago, a neighbor told NECN. 

Stephen Hensley said that he saw the woman and child get in a van and leave around the time of  'the first snowstorm' and he had not seen them afterwards. 

Capt Dougan said that the police currently believe that Wu left with her children shortly before Department of Children and Families officials came to her home.

He said the investigation is still focusing on New York City and that he is 'confident' that Wu and her children have not left the country.
