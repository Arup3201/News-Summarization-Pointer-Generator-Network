A Bonnie and Clyde-style couple who stole two police cars and sparked a high-speed chase across two states Tuesday have a history of using heroin, according to police.

Shayna Sykes and Blake Bills, both 23, began their reckless crime spree when they stole a civilian's car in Pennsylvania over the weekend, which later broke down in Camden, New Jersey. Police later learned that the couple had been spotted trying to buy heroin in the Camden area as early as Sunday.

Then on Tuesday, the couple zeroed in on a police car belonging to an officer who had just pulled someone over for a traffic violation.

Suspects: Shayna Sykes (left) and Blake Bills (right), both 23, have a history of using heroin and were spotted trying to buy the drug a couple days before they allegedly stole two police cars

Shayna Sykes, 23, and Blake Bills, 23, pictured with their seven-month-old child were involved in a two-state car chase today in which they stole two police cars

According to authorities, Sykes and 
Bills, who were not involved in the violation, jumped into the officer's
car and set off at top speed, rampaging across the Ben Franklin Bridge into
Philadelphia.

Police finally managed to apprehend the couple at 7th and 
Norris Streets in Philadelphia, but Sykes managed to evade officers while they 
took Bills into custody. She made off in another police car before she 
herself was arrested just 15 minutes later.

'I've never heard of anybody stealing two police cars in the same incident,' said Deputy Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard J. Ross Jr. adding that the incident was 'bold, reckless and absolutely brazen.'

The couple from Macungie, Pennsylvania, 
have a checkered history with the law and were already wanted by Camden 
police after an incident on Sunday when they evaded a chasing police 
car, causing it to crash.

Camden Police Chief Scott Thomson said the thwarted officer had interrupted them buying drugs.

'They're our junky version of Bonnie and Clyde,' said Thomson.

The shocking chase began just before 10 a.m. this morning when a Camden officer pulled over a car at Haddon Avenue and Federal Street in the crime ridden city.

'During the course of the stop, while the officer was outside his vehicle, two suspects entered the police cruiser and pulled off, striking the officer with the police vehicle,' said Camden City spokesman  Robert Corrales to Philly.com.

Injuring the police officer's leg as he tried to hault their audacious theft, Sykes and Bills raced over the Ben Franklin Bridge to Philadelphia.

The Delaware River Port Authority notified their colleagues in the city of brotherly love that the stolen car was headed their way and that officers from New Jersey State Police were in pursuit.

Crashing the car in the north of Philadelphia, police arrested Bills, but Sykes, escaped and managed to commandeer an empty police cruiser at 5th and Clearfield Streets one mile from where they had crashed. 

The car chase began in Camden, New Jersey just before 10 a.m. and finished 1100 N. Hope Street in Philadelphia just under 20 minutes later

Sykes proceeded to drive erratically along the winding streets of Philadelphia and side-swiped numerous vehicles

Police remarked after Sykes was arrested that it was a minor miracle that no one was seriously injured in the car chase

She motored off, striking numerous vehicles along the narrow streets and almost struck a female pedestrian but she was eventually boxed in by chasing police officers and arrested after a slight struggle.

Philadelphia police have charged the couple, who are suspected of being on drugs, with resisting arrest, DUI, eluding police, risking a catastrophe, and related offenses.

In addition, Camden County authorities have charged the two with Aggravated Assault and Theft.

'It was like a movie or something just unreal because we never seen anything like this before,' North Philadelphia resident Eric Brown said to ABC Local.

Police officials in New Jersey and Pennsylvania said they were sure that toxicology tests will prove positive for both Sykes (pictured) and Bills

Philadelphia Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Ross said it was lucky that only two people were hurt in the mad 15-minute car chase.

'A lot of people could have gotten hurt. It just was bizarre. In my time on this job, which is almost a quarter of a century, I've never heard of an instance where two police cars were stolen in the same incident,' said Ross.

Questioned on the wisdom of police officers leaving keys in the ignition, Ross was dismissive.

'You can Monday morning quarterback all day long, but at that particular time, I think it's safe to say that officer's first decision they had to make was the safety of their fellow officers,' said Ross.

'I would imagine if you were to poll police departments across the country, you probably would not find very many where they turn their car off during a car stop.'

Ross said the suspects were most likely intoxicated.

'You best bet a toxicology will be done and we do have every reason to believe that drugs were involved,' said Ross.
