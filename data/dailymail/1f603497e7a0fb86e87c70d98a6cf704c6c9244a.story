An Al-Qaeda leader suspected of recruiting White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has been shot dead in Kenya.

Abubakar Shariff Ahmed was killed by unidentified gunmen as he and a friend were walking from a court in Mombasa to a nearby mosque.

A witness said that two gunmen had opened fire, with around 20 shots fired as Ahmed, also known as Makaburi - meaning graveyard, fell to the floor, dressed in a white checked robe. His companion was also shot dead.

Killed: Al-Qaeda leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed, who is suspected of recruiting White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has been shot dead in Kenya

The witness said that police arrived soon afterwards, and slid the preacher's body into the back of an official pick up truck. 

Human rights activists' have claimed that the 
Kenyan government â€” rattled by the presence of Islamic extremists in Kenya and 
by the attack last year by al-Shabab on a Nairobi mall â€” was  behind the 
killing, and were also responsible for the deaths of two other Muslim leaders.

Ahmed
 had been linked to fugitive terror suspect Lewthwaite, dubbed the White
 Widow, as he helped more than 100 Britons to join Somali terrorist 
group al-Shabaab, which counts her as a member. 

The 29-year-old British Muslim convert is
 the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering
 the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, 
and three others with links to al-Shabaab.

However, in September last year Ahmed denied ever having met Lewthwaite, who is the widow of of 7/7 bomber 
Germaine Lindsay.

Ahmed was also linked to another British fanatic, Jermaine Grant, who is currently on trial over a plot to bomb hotels. A UN investigation has suggested that Ahmed and Grant took over the Kenyan and East African leadership of Al-Qaeda in 2012.

In October Ahmed told how he was 'living on borrowed time' after two other other Muslim leaders of a mosque that Makaburi was associated with were killed by unidentified gunmen in Mombasa.

When he was interviewed in October, Ahmed, who was seated under a cloth bearing a hand-painted sword and religious text in Arabic, railed against the killings of radical 
Muslim leaders, saying that while Kenyan security forces might think 
that killing them helps snuff out radical Islam, it actually increases 
the problem.

Worry: In October Ahmed told how he was 'living on borrowed time' after two other other Muslim leaders of a mosque that Makaburi was associated with were killed by unidentified gunmen in Mombasa.

Outspoken: In February Ahmed was pictured arguing with senior police officers outside the Masjid Musa Mosque in Mombasa, Kenya

'Mombasa youths are looking for guns. It was nothing, then knives, and now it's guns,' he said.

He
 added that whoever had ordered his two friends killed would also order 
his death. Police and the government have denied involvement but have 
made no arrests in connection with the shootings.

Yesterday the US Embassy deplored the recent violence in Kenya, including Makaburi's murder, and called for a full investigation.

The US has encouraged dialogue between the government and religious leaders 'to address the underlying causes of tensions and to help counter the danger presented by violent extremist groups.'

Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber 
Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between
 King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations.

She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam.

The British Muslim
 convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 
people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia.

Interpol
 issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks 
for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011.

 the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering
 the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, 
and three others with links to al-Shabaab.

On Tuesday evening, just prior to his
 death, Ahmed had left a courtroom where he had helped more than two 
dozen youths accused of being part of al-Shabaab.

Hussien
 Khalid, an official with a human rights group in Mombasa called Haki 
Africa, said government agents are prime suspects in such killings. He 
said 20 Muslims have been killed in the city the last four months.

'We know the government is targeting us now,' he said.

'We know our lives are in danger because we are speaking up against the atrocities they are committing to people at the coast, so they see us as the enemy to their cause, which is fraught with human rights violations.'

The US State Department's report on Kenya's human rights record published earlier this year found that Kenyan security forces were responsible for the most serious human rights abuses in 2013, 'including unlawful killings, forced disappearances, torture, and use of excessive force.'

Violent attacks have been increasing in Kenya. On Monday three blasts detonated in central Nairobi, killing six people Police said Wednesday they have since arrested 900 people from the Somali enclave of Nairobi.

Although described by some as charismatic and intelligent, Ahmed held radical views and notably said that the four al-Shabaab gunmen who slaughtered at least 67 people in Nairobi's Westgate Mall in September 'had every right to do what they did'.

'Islamically it is justified. We cannot allow foreign forces entering Muslim countries, killing innocent Muslim people and then it go unpunished,' he said, citing Kenya's military presence in Somalia and the need for an 'eye for an eye' defense of Muslim life.

A July report from the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea accused Ahmed of maintaining ties to a Kenyan terror group known as al-Hijra and said he wanted terrorist attacks to be deadlier.

Speaking in October, Ahmed said he was bound by the Quran to avenge the killings of his two friends, Sheik Aboud Rogo and Sheik Ibrahim Ismael.

'We will kill the people who killed them,' he said.

He argued that Muslims in Kenya have no other recourse.

'There is no law here. We are in the jungle,' he said. 'We cannot see our fellow Muslims being slaughtered in front of their children and wives and not do anything. We are the ones being terrorised here.'

Slain: Kenyan police put the Ahmed's into the back of a pickup truck

Probe: Security forces stand next to the bodies of Ahmed, center, and another man whose identity has not yet been established
