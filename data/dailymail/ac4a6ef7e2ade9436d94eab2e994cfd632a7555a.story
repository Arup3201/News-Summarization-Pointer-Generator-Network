New York Rep Sean Patrick Maloney, 47, became the second openly-gay congressman to marry in office when he wed longtime partner Randy Florke, 51, in a ceremony on Saturday.

The couple, who have been together for more than two decades, became engaged on Christmas Day after their youngest daughter wrote an endearing note to Santa, asking her two 'wonder-ful fathers get married'.

Maloney, a Democrat who represents New York's 18th District, got married at home in Cold Spring, New York in a ceremony that was attended by more than 250 guests - including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

The ceremony was officiated by the Rev Shane Scott Hamblen and held at St Mary-in-the-Highlands Church, where locals gathered on the sidewalks outside to see the parade of political attendees.

The newlyweds didn't speak to reporters at the ceremony or reception, but did issue a statement on the special day.

'Even after 22 years together, we're overwhelmed by how blessed we feel to celebrate this special day with out friends and family,' the couple said in a statement.

'Thank you to all our friends near and far for their love and support as we continue to fight to ensure all families can experience the joys of a lifetime commitment.'

'Santa, can you try making my wonder-ful fathers get married?': Florke popped the question to Maloney on Christmas Day, after their youngest-daughter wrote this heartwarming letter to Santa

Maloney became just the second congressman to get married in office, after former Massachusetts Rep Barney Frank wed two years ago.

Maloney and Florke have three children together: son Reiniel, 24, and daughters Daley, 13, and Essie, 11. The girls wore matching black and white dresses to the ceremony, and for family pictures taken against the backdrop of the lower Hudson Valley.

After the ceremony, the kids rode in their own convertible to the reception that was decorated with a sign reading 'our parents just got married'.

It was little Essie that was most responsible for the big day, since she prompted her dads' engagement with a special letter to Santa.

'Santa can you try making my wonder-ful fathers get married, they are a loving couple!' Essie, 11, wrote in a letter on her dad's congressional stationary. She also asked for legs and two nerf guns.

Florke, a real estate and design executive, took the wish to heart and popped the question to Maloney on Christmas morning.

'When we finished opening our presents, Randy just sort of disappeared from the room for a minute and then came back in, and I noticed that my oldest was filming on his camera - and it didn't even than I didn't figure it out,' Maloney told Buzzfeed earlier this year.

Equality: Maloney and Florke issued a statement to mark their wedding, saying they will 'continue to fight to ensure all families can experience the joys of a lifetime commitment'

'I gave him a bag for Christmas, a suitcase to match our other bag, and it was a really obvious bag when he saw the label. So, I said, "I’m giving you a really obvious gift. It’s a suitcase, but it comes with a proposal: I want to know if you will travel with me forever and marry me." I think his first words were, "Oh, Jesus." But, then, of course, he’s like, "Yes."' Florke said.

The newlyweds will unfortunately be skipping the traditional honeymoon since Maloney has a Tuesday primary to prepare for.

He was elected to New York's 18th Congressional District in 2012, after narrowly winning against Republican Nan Hayworth.

Before becoming a congressman, Maloney worked in state and national politics (including former President Bill Clinton), and ran a high-tech start-up.
