A new app has been developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection that will enable users to skip the long lines at passport control when they return from traveling abroad.

The Mobile Passport app for iOS and Android devices allows travelers to enter and submit their passport and customs declaration information using their smartphone or tablet instead of filling out traditional paper forms.

On Tuesday Miami International Airport became the second airport in the country to offer the new customs mobile app after an earlier successful trial at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

The free Mobile Passport app is free to download and is currently available to U.S. citizens with a valid U.S. passport and Canadian citizens with both a valid Canadian passport and B1 or B2 visa status.

After downloading the app, qualified travelers are prompted to set up a profile using information contained in their passport. The app also allows families traveling together to create multiple profiles.

Once the profile is complete, travelers can use Mobile Passport to answer standard customs declaration questions, submit their information electronically upon landing, and take advantage of dedicated lanes for Mobile Passport users. 

'We're embracing every technology tool available to make sure our passenger experience is as good as it gets,' said Miami-Dade Aviation Director Emilio T. González.

'MIA is the perfect fit for Mobile Passport: we are America's second-busiest port of entry, handling more than 20 million international passengers each year, and our organization is wholeheartedly committed to bringing the latest travel technology to our airport,'

Gonzalez said in a statement when the app first rolled out.
