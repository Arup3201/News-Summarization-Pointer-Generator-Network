Serena Williams has spoken out in defence of fellow tennis player Caroline Wozniacki who came under fire for an impression of the star which many blasted as racist.

The former world number 1 was accused of being racist after stuffing her bra and shorts to imitate Williams at a recent exhibition match against Maria Sharapova.

The Danish player was accused of racism by some observers but in an email to USA Today Williams said that was not her friend's intention.

Mimicking: Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki impersonates Serena Williams by carrying towels under her clothes simulating bigger breasts and bottom, during an exhibition match against Maria Sharapova

Prank: Wozniacki mentioned during a press conference after the game that she was performing an impression of her friend and fellow tennis player Serena Williams

'I know Caro and I would call her my 
friend,' she wrote. 'And I don't think she (meant) 
anything racist by it.'

Williams said she hadn't watched the video of the impersonation which went viral but said Wozniacki should 
think again before doing anything similar in the future given the 
storm.

'I must add, if people 
feel this way, she should take reason and do something different next 
time,' she wrote signing off with a emoticon smiley face.

Williams, who is currently training in Maurtitius, also pointed out other stars have mocked her physique

'(Roddick) and (Djokovic) do it all the time and Caro does (it) and now it's racist.??' she wrote.

'At the end of the day I spend my time focused on things to become better and not bring me down,' she continued.

Humour: The joke was not lost on her friend Williams, also in Brazil to promote the 2016 Games, who tweeted: 'Do they make Brazilian bikinis for, um, well, me?'.

The day before Williams, also in Brazil to promote the 2016 Games, had tweeted: 'Do they make Brazilian bikinis for, um, well, me?'.

22-year-old Wozniacki
 smiled and laughed as she came on court at the contest in Sao Paulo, Brazil, imitating Williams in front of a
 crowd including her boyfriend golfer Rory McIlroy.

But the amusement didn't last for long.

On Tumblr, one blogger wrote: 'This isn’t “harmless fun” as one article described it. its 
racist. out and outright racism. mocking and making fun of the bodies of
 black women for a laugh? real funny, stupid white girl. real real 
funny.'

Another blogger pointed out: 'It may have been done in
 “jest,” but I love how people can can turn a black woman’s body and 
sexuality into a caricature. However, we should not have the autonomy to
 celebrate any successes of our own.

While
 on feministing.com, an article read: 'Given the history and current-day
 context of racialized standards of beauty, and the hypersexualization 
of people of color, when a white woman makes fun of a black women’s 
body, especially in a way that hypersexualizes her and draws on the 
stereotype of black women’s big butts, it’s racist.'

Williams is well known for referring to her curvaceous figure - the day before the tennis star, also in Brazil to promote the 2016 Games, had tweeted: 'Do 
they make Brazilian bikinis for, um, well, me?'.

In
 July she tweeted a photo of her bottom, with the accompanying words: 
'Hummm I think this onzie makes me butt look TOO big. Ugh. 
#BigButtproblems.'

Wozniacki
 mentioned during a press conference after the game that she was 
performing an impression of her friend and fellow tennis player Serena 
Williams.

She said: 'I really love the crowd here, they're open and they have a lot of fun.'

This was not the first time Wozniacki imitated the American icon - she also copied her last year as well.

Tennis
 impersonations are usually the hallmark of Novak Djokovic - the Serb 
has imitated off rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, as well as 
women's stars Williams and Sharapova.
