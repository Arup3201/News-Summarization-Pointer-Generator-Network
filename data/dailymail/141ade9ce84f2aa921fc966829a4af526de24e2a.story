A Texas community is outraged over a newly released video showing and officer calling a pitbull over (not the dog pictured) before shooting the dog to death

CBS DFW reports that the officer was called to Lindsey Lane in response to a 911 call from a woman saying three pits were menacing a car and keeping people from leaving.

The loose dogs belonged to neighbor Amanda Henderson.

She said the footage showed a murder.

'I see him murdering my puppy, our family...our dog,' she told WFAA. 

She says that the footage shows no reason to shoot her dog.

'Never once did Max stop wagging his tail. Never once do you hear a growl, an aggressive anything,' she said. 

Footage shows one pitbull running up to one cop with its tail wagging upon the officer's arrival.

Another officer, fitted with a body camera, can be seen going behind the house to find two more dogs in a ditch.

Police say the video is not representative of the situation, and that the officer who fired was trying to get the dogs secure until animal control could respond when one animal became a threat

The unidentified officer is heard to make kissing noises at the animals as a gun comes into frame. 

The officer claims the dog was charging with teeth barred when he opened fire, but in the footage the gun fills most of the frame.

Police say the video is not representative of the situation, and that the officer who fired was trying to get the dogs secure until animal control could respond when one animal became a threat.  

Residents are not comfortable with how he handled the situation.

'To call the dog and act like you’re going to be sweet to the dog, and you just blatantly shoot it, I don’t think that’s right at all,' says neighbor Virginia Granger.

Both the pitbull's owners and the 911 caller have since moved out of the neighborhood

Kristin Dodge, who also lives in the area, told CBS DFW the dogs were well behaved and played with her kids.

'These are people’s pets. These are people’s family. To see something like that happen wasn’t really necessary, I think,' she said. 

Both the pitbull's owners and the 911 caller have since moved out of the neighborhood.

Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call police at 817-556-8894.
