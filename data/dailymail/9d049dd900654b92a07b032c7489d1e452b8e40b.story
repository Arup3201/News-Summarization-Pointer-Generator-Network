Experts have confirmed Sydney's northern beaches and north shore are the perfect breading grounds for deadly funnel web spiders.

But brave residents who capture the animals can play an important part in developing crucial anti-venom necessary for treating life-threatening bites.

The confirmation of Sydney's northen suburbs being ideal funnel web territory follows a traumatic ordeal experienced by a northern beaches family, when a six-year-old girl was bitten on the finger by a male species of the spider.

Following the girl's bite, there have been reports from other residents in the area who have spotted the dangerous arthropods near their homes, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Australian Museum retired spider specialist Mike Gray said the region in Sydney's north was a hotspot for the infamous funnel web arachnid, because of the combination of bush, sloping ground and rocky terrain.

'They like to make burrows under rocks, rotting logs and in tree roots, where the ground tends to stay moist,' he said.

Mr Gray said male funnel webs often wander into homes during summer and autumn.

On Wednesday, the six-year-old girl was rushed to a Sydney hospital after mistaking a funnel web for a toy and being bitten.

As the spider's venom started to take effect, the young girl began vomiting, shaking uncontrollably and sweating and suffered cloudy vision.

The girl's father, who does not want his family identified, said his daughter has since been recovering at home and after being released from hospital on Thursday afternoon and was fine, although a little weak.

Doctors gave the young girl three vials of the anti-venom to treat the poison and told the girl's family to monitor her for signs of relapsing over the next four weeks.

It was thought she may have been bitten by a rare sub-species of the spider for the northern beaches area and there are ongoing test to confirm this.

The Australian Reptile Park curator Liz Gabriel previoulsy said despite peak season being from November to April, funnel webs can still be out and particularly this year due to the mild weather.

The reptile park, located on the Central Coast north of Sydney, collects funnel web spiders to create anti-venom.

To create the anti-venom, trained staff at the park carefully milk up to 500 male spiders, caught within 150km of Sydney.

The venom is then sent to laboratory where anti-venom is developed.

Residents who safely catch the animals can take them to drop off points in Brookvale, Mona Vale and Hornsby.

The father of the young girl who was bitten said he encouraged others to support the reptile park's work, as his daughter was living proof anti-venom saves lives. 'We will be forever grateful,' he said.

There have been 13 recorded deaths from funnel web bites in NSW but none since the anti-venom was developed in 1981.

Greencross Vets vet director Dr Adam Stenberg recently had four funnel web spiders waiting to be collected by the reptile park and said despite only offering the service for the last six weeks, about 12 spiders had been dropped off, with four this week.

'The only way the anti-venom can be created is by extracting venom from live funnel webs and so every donation we get helps to save lives,' he said.

For those game enough to try capturing a funnel web spider, Dr Stenberg said recommended using long tweezers, a stick or even chopsticks to direct the animal into a deep container.

While the spiders will not be capable of climbing out, he said a lid is needed.
