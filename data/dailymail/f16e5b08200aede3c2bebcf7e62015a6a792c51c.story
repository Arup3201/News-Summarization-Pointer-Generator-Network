David Moyes has told Steven Gerrard he would be welcome at Real Sociedad next season if he decides that before finally turning his back on European football he fancies a La Liga swansong.

The former Everton manager paid tribute to the Liverpool legend saying: 'He has had a great career for his club and for England and he will be very difficult to replace. If he ever wanted to come to play in Spain he knows he can phone me.'

Gerrard almost joined Real Madrid in 2005 and Real Sociedad – the first club of former Liverpool team-mate Xabi Alonso – would certainly welcome the former England captain who looks destined for LA Galaxy when the season ends.

Moyes' praise for Gerrard came as he spoke ahead of Sunday's meeting with Barcelona as La Liga resumes after the mid-winter break. He admitted enjoying his first free festive period in over a quarter of a decade but also said he had spent the time in England looking for loan signings.

Moyes said: 'It was nice to have Christmas dinner with my family. That is not always possible as a Premier League manager. I have not had a Christmas off for what must be 25 years. But I also went to games and I spoke to a lot of football people back home and asked a lot of questions about players and availability.'

The former Manchester United manager has been linked with Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj, Liverpool midfielder Emre Can and Stoke's Charlie Adam. But he refused to be drawn on individual targets saying: 'I have very clear ideas about what I want to do. But I'll keep that to myself right now because maybe the people I would like to get are not available right now or what I would like to change is not possible at the moment.'
