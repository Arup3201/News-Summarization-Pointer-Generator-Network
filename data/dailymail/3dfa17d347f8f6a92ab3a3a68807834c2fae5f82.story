Her fiery orange stare is certainly fearsome enough to scare off burglars. The problem is, it’s also frightening off potential owners.

Bagheera – named after the amber-eyed panther in the Jungle Book – has been unable to find a home since she arrived at a rescue centre in Italy as a six-month-old puppy.

People were put off by her striking eyes, which are the result of a rare gene.

The black collie cross first went to a rescue centre in Italy as a six-month old puppy, but no-one adopted her - with many put off by her strange orange eyes, which are incredibly rare in a dog

Nervous: A combination of difficult behaviour and lack of training is putting Brits off adopting Bagheera 

So Teckels Animal Sanctuaries in Gloucester has brought the black Collie-Belgian Shepherd cross, now eight, over to England in the hope of finding her her very first home.

Alice Breaks, a senior kennel technician at Teckels, said: 'I love her, she is lovely looking and her eyes are this amazing orange colour.

'I have never come across a dog with eyes like hers before. 

Bagheera's orange eyes, which are incredibly rare in a dog, is thought to put prospective owners off

'Bagheera is quite nervous and we are struggling to find her a home. She needs to go to a quiet, adult-only home which is ideally in a rural setting. 

The default eye colour for a dog is brown. 

Amber eyes in dogs usually occur when the uemelanin (natural dark pigment in an organism) produced is diluted by recessive genes.

All liver, blue and isabella dogs have amber eyes.

Very occasionally, dogs with a black pigment also have amber eyes.  

'She has been in a rescue home since the age of six-months but she is now becoming more friendly.

 'She will always have certain issues but I have taught her some English and she will sit and give her a paw when she feels comfortable.

'We think she is a Collie crossed with a Belgian Shepherd. Hopefully someone with experience will come forward and give her a home.'

Phillip Robinson, Battersea Dogs & Cats Home's veterinary surgeon, said: 'Eye colour is genetically linked to the parent animals and it is exceptionally rare to see this type of pigmentation in dogs of this breed.

'Hopefully her eye-catching feature will help Bagheera find a new family and settle down into a permanent home.'
