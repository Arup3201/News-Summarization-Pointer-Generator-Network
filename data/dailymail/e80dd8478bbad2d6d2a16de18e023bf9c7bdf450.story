Louis van Gaal has backed Michael van Praag's bid to become FIFA president.

Van Gaal knows Van Praag as he worked under him at Ajax and with the Dutch national side.

Van Praag, the head of the Dutch Football Association, is one of three candidates vying to unseat current FIFA president Sepp Blatter, the others being Asian Football Confederation vice-president Prince Ali bin Al Hussein and former Portugal international Luis Figo.

And the Manchester United manager believes his 67-year-old compatriot is capable of heading world football's governing body, although he concedes it will be a tough job beating Blatter, who is determined to extend his 17-year reign.

'I have a very good relationship with him,' the United manager said when asked about Van Praag.

'I like him very much. He can do the job but it shall be very difficult for him to be the (president) because it is a voting system but you never know.' 

Current FIFA president Sepp Blatter is standing for re-election having held this position for 17 years to date
