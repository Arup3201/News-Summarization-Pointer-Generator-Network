UK sales of the new generation of BlackBerry smartphones have been better than expected with one model already selling out, the company's chief executive has said.

Thorsten Heins hailed the success of his company's latest devices and said he is confident that Blackberry can make up ground lost to Apple and Android.

The new phones were launched in the UK just last week, after excruciating delays allowed Apple, Samsung and others to build commanding leads in the industry.

'It's beyond expectations': BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins, pictured at the launch of BlackBerry 10 in New York last week, says the UK release of the company's new phones has gone better than they planned

Mr Heins said a substantial number of UK users are moving from other platforms to BlackBerry and said that is an encouraging sign because they first targeted long-time BlackBerry users.

'It's beyond expectations,' he said. 'White is sold out already. The black is hard to stock up again. It's very encouraging.

'I won't share the number because I need to verify it, but we are getting a substantial number of users moving from other platforms to BlackBerry. That is an interesting data point.'

BlackBerry shares closed up 15 per cent yesterday on initial reports of strong UK sales and after an analyst upgraded the stock. That came after a 12 per cent fall in value immediately following the launch.

But Mr Heins admitted the real struggle for the revamped company, formerly known as Research In Motion, will come with the U.S. launch slated for mid-March.

He told the Associated Press that he was disappointed that the U.S. release date lags so far behind other markets, a result of the rigid testing systems of authorities and phone networks there.

'We need to respect that. Am I a bit disappointed? Yeah, I would be lying saying no. But it is what it is and we're working with all our carrier partners to speed it up as much as we can,' he said in the interview.

Mr Heins said they have to retake market share in the US for BlackBerry to be successful. The US has been one market in which RIM has been struggling, even as the company is doing well in many places overseas.

According to research firm IDC, shipments of BlackBerry phones plummeted from 46 per cent of the US market in 2008 to just 2 per cent in 2012. The iPhone and Android now dominate.

Mr Heins, who a year ago replaced long-time executives who had presided over BlackBerry's fall, said he is confident that BlackBerry can become the third ecosystem behind Apple and phones running Google's Android operating system.

'We need to win back market share to be relevant,' he said. 'We have to be aggressive in the US market.'

The new BlackBerrys are a make-or-break product. The pioneering brand, once a business essential, lost its cachet not long after Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, which reset expectations for what a smartphone should do.

The company promised a new system to catch up, using technology it got through its 2010 purchase of QNX Software Systems.

But it has taken more than two years to unveil new phones that are redesigned for the new multimedia, internet browsing and apps experience that customers are now demanding.

BlackBerry's new Z10 handsets do not have a home button, instead using a user's thumb to 'flick' across the screen.

They also have a new 'peek' feature that allows owners to see their email and other messages from anywhere in the phone's menu system by swiping from the left of the screen.

The firm also said it had worked to create the 'best typing experience' of any handset.

The new BlackBerry 10 OS also boasts a new feature called balance to switch between a personal and business mode - each with its own applications, wallpaper and settings.

'People run around with two phones, a private one and a personal one,' said Mr Heins at the launch last week. 'We wanted to address that, and people can switch with a single flick.'

He said the new handsets were for 'people who are hyper-connected socially, who need balance in both personal and professional lives.

'People who want to flow, who don't want a home button. Blackberry 10 will keep them moving.'
