'Hey, is your dad the bass player in INXS?'

There it was… the standard question during my weekly social event. As usual, I'd try not to act irritated, slap on a smile and respond with a civil return: 'Yes he is! Garry 'Gary' Beers.'

A tedious drone of questions about fame, tours and life-as-­the‐daughter‐of‐a‐D‐list‐rock‐star would follow, most of which I would politely answer before excusing myself to get another wine… or two.

I suppose it would be socially inappropriate to tell the truth: that you can't judge a band by its cover.

Little do my acquaintances at the bar know my contact with my dad is purely through email… less than a dozen per year. 

My responses (if not silence) are melancholy answers, much like how I respond to sloppy pick-up attempts or family friends who ask the age-old questions such as 'what are you studying?' or 'what are your life goals?'

My father is a stranger to me, and does not deserve any personal rhetoric, especially through superficial email.

However, there was an occasion recently when I did manage to find a heated reaction. 

A mere few hours after the much‐awaited INXS miniseries: 'Never Tear Us Apart,' aired in Melbourne, I had a lovely egotistical email in my inbox asking:` 'What did you think of Hugh Sheridan playing myself?'

Much like the INXS autobiography, the series failed on all accounts to factually explain Garry's personal life – not to mention his Peter Pan syndrome. 

Lucy and her sister Matilda grew up on a NSW farm with their father when he wasn't touring

Lucy writes that her father Garry has 'five children in three different countries'

Lucy writes that her dad is 'now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside'

The lovable Hugh Sheridan, playing my father, Garry 'Gary', rationalises sleeping with a backup singer because he was 'lonely' and 'she was beautiful'.

There you go folks, it's all justified when you see a beautiful woman and you're lonely on tour, while your pregnant wife was at home with a brand new Harley Davidson as a gift for your return.

The series seemed to conveniently leave out the fact that Garry has five children in three different countries and is now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside. Or that the fetus in the opening scene of 'Never Tear Us Apart' - soon to be me, has mostly grown up without a father.

Australian rock band INXS first formed in Sydney as The Farriss Brothers in 1977.

The band - made up of Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on guitar, Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone, Garry Gary Beers on bass, and main lyricist Michael Hutchence on vocals - was fronted by Hutchence for 20 years.

The star, who dated pop singer Kylie Minogue in the 1990s, was found dead in his hotel suite in Sydney in November 1997.

INXS, who have sold close to 40 million records worldwide, had their story turned into a TV mini series in 2013.

INXS: Never Tear Us Apart aired on the Seven Network in February this year and told of the band's behind the scenes antics.

Luke Arnold played Hutchence, Alex Williams played Pengilly, Nicholas Masters played Tim Farriss, Hugh Sheridan played Beers, Ido Drent was Jon Farriss and Andy Ryan was Andrew Farriss.

Meanwhile, Damon Herriman played band manager CM Murphy and Samantha Jade was cast as Kylie Minogue.

Sure, I had a comfortable childhood. Until the age of thirteen, I was riding in tractor buckets, hunting bandicoots and sitting in the tin dingy on one of our dams - all memories I shared with my dad and our secluded farm in Somersby, NSW, north of Sydney.

But as my proverbial father once quoted in their autobiography 'INXS Story to Story': 'The cliché is true: you don't know what you've got until it's gone.' For $45 apiece, you would think he would stick to a more honest motto.

When INXS's long‐lived fame fell to the wayside, as it expectedly did, my dad did not accept it easily. For a man who thrived off a diet of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll, a settled family lifestyle with us was not appealing in the slightest – he longed to be back on tour fooling around with instruments and women.

About the time we sold the farm, everything went south, including my mother, sister and me.

My father told us he was packing up and moving to the United States to marry one of his conquests on the day we were moving house.

There were the obvious reassurances (as in any divorce scenario) that the family would remain as close to normal as possible and our father/ daughter relationship would not falter.

How could it? He was only moving 12,000 kilometres away.

We are a decade on, and I am lucky to receive an email on my birthday – never filled with anything more than petty small talk, attached photos of his two-­year‐old blonde twins and the frequent sign-off of, 'I am your Father' – which is obviously always read in the voice of Darth Vader.

She explains how her little sister found out about her father's affairs in the INXS autobiography in the school library

Lucy (pictured here on her 21st birthday with a friend) says she is 'fine' because her mother raised her

A multitude of excuses have escaped my dad's mouth in his time, but never the word 'sorry'.

It is clear he is not sorry that my little sister found out about his first affair in the INXS autobiography in the school library, or that we were sent to four psychologists to understand why we were upset with him for abandoning us like stray dogs.

For the record, I am fine. Thanks to my mother I have a very fortunate life and am working hard to follow my dreams. If I have learnt one thing from my parents though, it's how far apart two people can be.
