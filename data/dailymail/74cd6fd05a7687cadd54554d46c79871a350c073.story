Fabio Capello has blasted the mentality of English footballers and claimed they need a tyrant in charge to control them.

Former England manager Capello, now in charge of Russia at the 2014 World Cup will face Belgium on Sunday night in their second Group H game after drawing 1-1 with South Korea on Wednesday.

He led England at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where, after navigating their way through the group stages they lost 4-1 to Germany in the round of 16.

That looks like a successful tournament compared to England's travails in this tournament which has seen them eliminated after just two games following losses to Italy and Uruguay.

The former AC Milan, Real Madrid and Juventus manager, who has won seven league titles and a Champions League in a glittering managerial career, believes English players are too indulged and used to their creature comforts and insists he is better suited to managing Russia who buy into his work ethic.

Thumbs up? Capello led England out of the group stage at the 2010 World Cup but no further

He is quoted by the Sunday People as saying: ‘Yes, I am strict. Sometimes you need to be a tyrant. Sometimes you need to be strong. Sometimes you need to shout.

‘When the English players complained, I told them this is the life of an athlete. We represent the country. We sacrifice.

‘You think the best athletes drink every day and stay with their wives and girlfirends every day? No! We go to the training camp and we work together.

‘I think we need this. Someone else might think differently but this is my idea of football. I feel the Russians understand me.’
