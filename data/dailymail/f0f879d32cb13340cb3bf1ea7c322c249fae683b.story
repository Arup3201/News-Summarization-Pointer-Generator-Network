Chelsea got themselves in the mood for their Champions League encounter with French giants Paris Saint-Germain with a gentle stroll around the city.

The squad were pictured walking around the five-star L'Hotel Du Collectionneur in Paris on Tuesday morning, with police security monitoring the surrounding area with close surveillance.

Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was also spotted and photographed going into the Chelsea team hotel, where he is believed to have met up with Blues boss Jose Mourinho.

The pair struck up a close relationship during Mourinho's first spell in England as Chelsea boss, remaining on good terms ever since. 

The Blues take on Laurent Blanc's side in the first leg of their last 16 tie on Tuesday night, with Mourinho's side hoping to take an advantage back to Stamford Bridge for the reverse fixture in three weeks time. 

The west London side will be hoping for an altogether better result to the last time they visited the Parc des Princes in April 2014 in the quarter finals of the same competition.

Edinson Cavani and Javier Pastore were both on target as the hosts ran out convincing 3-1 winners in the first leg against Mourinho's men, before the Blues pegged back the French side in the concluding leg with a 2-0 victory - progressing through to the semi-finals by virtue of away goals. 

Ahead of the mouth-watering clash with the French Champions, Mourinho has 17-goal Diego Costa available for selection following a three-match ban - although the 52-year-old is not convinced the 26-year-old will be firing on all cylinders on Tuesday night.

Ahead of the match Mourinho said on Costa's return: 'A long rest is not good for him. I don't think it's good for him or any player.

Mourinho believes Diego Costa will not be at his best against PSG following a three-match ban

'A little rest is welcome for everyone; a big rest isn't good for the players. 

'So we are not going to see the best Diego. I hope I'm wrong, but probably he will need this game to try and get it.' 

Both sides go into the game with plenty of confidence, with Chelsea seven points clear at the top of the Premier League and still on the hunt for a historic treble, while PSG are searching a third successive Ligue 1 triumph this term, currently sitting just two points off the leaders Lyon.
