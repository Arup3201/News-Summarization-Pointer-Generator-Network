Team news

Manchester United 

Louis van Gaal has a shortage of centre-backs for Saturday's home game against Crystal Palace.

Marcos Rojo (shoulder), Phil Jones (shin), Chris Smalling (suspension) and Jonny Evans (ankle) are all unavailable so midfielder Michael Carrick looks set to start in defence alongside either Tyler Blackett or Paddy McNair.

Right-back Rafael (hamstring) is a major doubt for the match at Old Trafford and striker Radamel Falcao (leg) is out.

Provisional squad: De Gea, Lindegaard, Amos, Rafael, Vermijl, Shaw, Blackett, Thorpe, McNair, Pereira, Blind, Fletcher, Valencia, Lingard, Fellaini, Anderson, Carrick, Young, Herrera, Mata, Januzaj, Di Maria, Rooney, Van Persie, W Keane.

Crystal Palace 

Captain Mile Jedinak will miss Crystal Palace's trip to Manchester United on Saturday having been sent off in Monday night's loss to Sunderland.

The Australia international has played in every Palace game since they won promotion back into the Premier League last year but will sit out the game at Old Trafford as he serves a one-match ban.

Wilfried Zaha is also unavailable to Eagles' boss Neil Warnock as he is on loan from United - but Damien Delaney is likely to return to the squad after illness kept him out of the Sunderland game.

Provisional squad: Speroni, Hennessey, Mariappa, Kelly, Fryers, Dann, Delaney, Ward, Hangeland, Bannan, Ledley, McArthur, Bolasie, Thomas, Puncheon, Gayle, Guediora, Campbell, Johnson, Doyle, Chamakh.
