She's the queen of the glossy, bouncy blow-dry and has her own successful haircare range, so it was only a matter of time before Tamara Ecclestone channeled her expertise into opening a salon.

The businesswoman and mother-of-one is getting set to open the rose gold doors to her first UK blow dry bar, Show Dry, this weekend in London.

Keen to hear her well-placed haircare tips and put the swanky service to the test, FEMAIL joined Tamara (and baby Sophia) at the glossy Westbourne Grove salon - and it certainly lived up to expectation.

Speaking to FEMAIL, the Formula One heiress and founder of Show Beauty (her luxurious haircare range) explained that the salon combines sumptuous interiors, the service of sleek designer boutiques and exclusivity of private members clubs.

She said: 'As a working wife and new mother I know how hard it is to look and feel great when you don’t have much time and Show Dry aims to provide a slick, time efficient service that allows all women the time to feel fabulous no matter how much time you "don’t have". Speed is everything to me these days.'

The socialite has taken every last detail into consideration and for someone with a taste for the finer things in life, you can expect the best of everything.

Each station is kitted out with an iPad, which is filled with magazines (to prevent clutter), hair inspiration snaps, a healthy menu (almond milk latte, anyone?), and  even a personal driver service courtesy of Uber to protect newly styled hair.

'My home was the inspiration, this could be in my house,' she said of the opulent surroundings.

'The ceiling was inspired by the range's packaging and the rose gold and black is very on brand; I wanted it to be an extension of what I already started.'

Despite the swanky surroundings, getting your hair styled a la Tamara will only set you back between £18-£45.

FEMAIL's Bianca London and Martha Cliff - who had never had a blow-dry before - tested out Tamara's £35 signature blow-dry.

Speaking about her first-ever blow-dry experience, Martha said: 'I would never have bothered to spend money on a blow-dry, I felt like it was a waste of time but Tamara has changed my mind. 

'This is a look you can't achieve at home, I feel like a Disney princess,' said Martha of her new 'do, which survived a post-salon decorating session at home.

Bianca, meanwhile, was really impressed with how speedy the service was and how healthy her hair looked and felt afterwards.

'I recently had balayage so my hair isn't in the best condition but the Show range really helped restore my locks. I left the salon with the lightest, healthiest, bounciest hair. I will definitely be a regular at the salon.'

The wash station is located downstairs where clients can sit back and relax in massage chairs whilst experts tend to their tresses

Designed with busy women in mind, Show Dry opens its doors at 7am and closes at 9pm on weekdays, while Saturday services run between 10am-5pm.

As our visit testified, you can be in and out in under half an hour but that doesn't mean Show Dry scrimps on service.

Whilst the grand opening this weekend is her main priority, Tamara is already busy planning for the future of her burgeoning brand.  

'We've got a wet line of shampoos, conditioners and treatments coming out,' she revealed. 'We are also launching a product for the body in the summer and have another site plan for a Show Dry bar in London.' 

'Going globally is always the aim!'. 

These are two examples of the types of styles Show Dry will be offering and a blow dry will set you back between £18-£45

Tamara launched Show Beauty last year and it includes dry shampoos and styling essentials, priced at around £35 per product
