A popular janitor at a South Florida gym has been revealed to have been living a secret life as a serial bank robber up until his death earlier this month.

Michael J. Webb, 56, had recently been promoted from head janitor to facilities supervisor at LA Fitness in Deerfield Beach and was described by his boss as reliable and someone who could be trusted to do the right thing.

In fact, Webb was a career criminal who had been in and out of prison since his early 20s.

‘If the power went out, or something 
broke, I would call Mike and he would know exactly what to do,’ Sean 
Lynch, the gym's general manager, told The Sun Sentinel. ‘So when the FBI walked in, showed me his picture and told me he was dead, it hit me like a ton of bricks.’

Webb died on Nov. 2, gunned down after a car chase with police when his final robbery went terribly wrong.

Police had dubbed Webb the ‘counter jumper,' after he had carried out a spate of five local robberies in as many months.

But Webb’s attempt at a sixth local robbery, turned out to be his last. Police say he traveled just four miles from his home to the Chase Bank in Pompano Beach, a branch he had already robbed twice before.

Webb walked into the branch wearing a ski mask and carrying a gun only to find that a bullet-proof glass partition had been erected since his last visit.

Realizing that he wasn’t going to be successful this time, Webb rushed from his bank and fled onto the northbound interstate in his truck.

With police giving chase, Webb's blue Dodge Ram spun and rolled onto a grassy area. When he began to crawl out of the overturned truck with a gun in his hand, two deputies opened fire on him.

Almost 20 years before his recent crime spate, Webb was been known to police by another nickname – the Bandanna Bandit. Over a seven-month period in 1989 and 1990, Webb had robbed 11 South Florida banks, including seven in Fort Lauderdale, stealing more than $100,000.

Gym co-owners Lynch and Mike Smith say they had know of Webb’s distance past as a bank robber, but had been convinced by him that he had gone straight a long time ago.

On occasion Webb had shared details about his past over a beer after work. They knew he had done time in prison, was estranged from two sons, and that despite a mainly cheerful manner at work, he could also get depressed and moody.

Webb first served time for unarmed robbery in his hometown of Providence, R.I. Once out he was soon busted for armed robbery and was sent back for another six years.

After moving to South Florida, Webb was arrested in 1986 on a second-degree attempted murder charge, and served 3 1/2 years in state prison. As the ‘Bandanna Bandit’ he was caught in 1990 in a chase similar to the one that ended his life.

Webb first worked at LA Fitness in 2008. Lynch and Smith were so impressed with Webb, that they rehired him in 2010 after he had been jailed for several months on a domestic battery charge that was later dismissed.

Webb earned his trust, Lynch said, and he even had his own security key. Just days before his demise, Webb had been promoted from lead janitor to facilities supervisor. The new role would boost his pay from $14 to $18.50 an hour, with full benefits, medical and dental.
