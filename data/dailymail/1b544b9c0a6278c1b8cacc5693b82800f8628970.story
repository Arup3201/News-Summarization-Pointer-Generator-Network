A missing British mountaineer has been found dead in northern Spain.

Barrie Cadd, 24, was found on Monday afternoon after the launch of a major police air and land search.

The climber vanished last Wednesday as he tried to reach a 8,500ft peak in a Spanish national park.

Police have yet to reveal details of where he was from in the UK.

Friends he was climbing with decided to turn back before reaching the Pena Vieja summit in the Picos De Europa, 20 miles inland from the northern coast of Spain.

He was supposed to rejoin them later the same day but never showed.

An air and land search involving police mountain rescue specialists and three helicopters was launched the following day.

Pena Vieja is the ninth highest point of the Picos de Europa, which translate literally as the Peaks of Europe.

The most widely accepted origin for the name is that they were the first sight of Europe for ships arriving from the Americas.
