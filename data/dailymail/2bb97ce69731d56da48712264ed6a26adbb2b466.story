Did Mario Balotelli really get a standing ovation from Liverpool fans after doing the square root of nothing for 71 minutes against Aston Villa on Saturday evening?

I thought players had to earn that kind of reaction, not just turn up and wear the shirt.

Liverpool fans have rightly given standing ovations to some very special and hard-working players in the past. These supporters traditionally know their stuff, they demand a lot before giving their seal of approval.

Yet Balotelli has turned up, said the right things to get the fans onside, shown a bit of swagger but not a lot of quality, and the Anfield faithful seem to be happy with that.

Shouldn’t you lot be demanding more?

If the message to Balotelli from the fans is that Saturday’s effort (or lack of it) is enough to keep them happy, then why would he demand more from himself?

I’m all for supporting and encouraging a player, especially a new signing. That’s why it’s hard to criticise Manchester United fans for going a little bit over the top with their cheering and applause for Radamel Falcao – as he warmed up.

But in recent years Liverpool fans have enjoyed the quality and energy of Luis Suarez, the passion and commitment of Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard, the desire to improve shown by Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson.

It’s early days for Balotelli, and he may turn out to be brilliant. But then, and only then, will he deserve the kind of response he received on Saturday evening.

If his match sharpness really isn’t there yet, as Brendan Rodgers seems to suggest, then I can’t understand why Rickie Lambert didn’t start ahead of Balotelli. I’m not convinced that is a good enough excuse for Balotelli’s inertia on Saturday. He hadn’t been away on international duty so he should have done better.

Brendan Rodgers probably should have started with Rickie Lambert ahead of the not-fully-fit Balotelli 

Don’t settle for less than what you deserve Liverpool fans – just because his name is Mario Balotelli doesn’t mean he should get away with giving less than what you supporters deserve. More effort and more quality is required from the Italian international.

Or I suspect that faith from the fans will be tested to the full.
