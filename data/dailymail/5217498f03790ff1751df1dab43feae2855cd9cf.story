A teacher has been instructed by her school to lose her northern accent and sound ‘more southern’.

The woman, who works at a secondary school in West Berkshire, was told to focus on ‘sounding less Cumbrian’ as one of her official performance targets by her bosses.

The order apparently came after an Ofsted inspector made a comment about her accent.

It is unclear whether the comment was simply an off-the-cuff remark or an official observation.

In any case, the school appears to have acted on it.

But it has been 
described as the ‘most extreme and bizarre objective’ ever heard of by 
the teachers’ union, which said it was also an ‘extreme form of 
discrimination and bullying’. 

The
 teacher herself did not make an official complaint to the National 
Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers but raised the 
issue when discussing the targets set by her school.

Paul Watkins, 
NASUWT’s national executive member for the West Berkshire area, said: 
‘Apparently the beginning of this was Ofsted, who made a comment about 
her accent.

'Victimisation': The order by school bosses to take the comment seriously has been confirmed by a teaching union, which described it as the 'most extreme and bizarre objective' it had ever heard (file picture)

'As a consequence of that comment being made, it was decided 
that it would be a reasonable objective to impose upon the member.

‘She
 was told she needed to make her northern Cumbrian accent sound more 
southern. We are very disturbed by this issue – it is victimisation.’

Mr
 Watkins said union officials would be arranging talks with the local 
education authority. He refused to identify the school, except to say it
 has a number of issues which the union is challenging, including its 
potential transformation into an academy.

An
 Ofsted spokesman said that it was not aware of the comments made by an 
inspector and would investigate if the union provided the name of the 
school.

He added: 
‘Inspectors comment on the standard of teaching at schools.

'Negative 
comments about the suitability of regional accents are clearly 
inappropriate, and should form no part of our assessment of a school’s 
or teacher’s performance.’

NOTE: Ofsted contacted MailOnline on November 20 to say the school in question had 'confirmed that there was never any mention of regional accents by the inspectors'. This new information was put to NASUWT, where a spokesman said the union would not be commenting further.
