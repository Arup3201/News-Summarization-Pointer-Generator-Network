This beautiful Edwardian mansion in East Sussex, which featured in Marks & Spencer's star-studded summer campaign, has come on the market for a cool £5million.

Celebrities including Annie Lennox, Rita Ora, Emma Thompson and Alek Wek, were captured sitting around a dining table amidst the lush gardens, in video footage for the summer clothing campaign.

The ensemble cast of inspirational women, which also included campaigner Doreen Laurence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen, fashion guru Lulu Kennedy and chef Rachel Khoo, talked honestly about style and influence in the footage taken at Saltcote Place.

The surrounding Sussex countryside was also used as the backdrop for the campaign imagery. Star snapper Annie
 Leibovitz captured the women in a typically English garden setting and on nearby Camber Sands, a stunning stretch of English coastline.

The Rye Country mansion overlooks some of the most beautiful stretches of countryside and coastline in the UK, making it the perfect base for the brand's ad campaign. The breathtaking views stretch from Dover to Fairlight 
over Camber Sands beach and Rye Bay.

With its classic white facade, the picture-perfect Queen Anne-style property is a natural match for the typically British fashion brand.

With 10 bedrooms and five bathrooms, 
there's plenty of room for a spot of country entertaining at the manor. And of course
 the reception rooms are fittingly majestic too.

The 
property is approached via a long tree-lined drive flanked by lawns and
 then through imposing entrance gates, which open onto the drive and main entrance doors.

Formal gardens surround the house with manicured lawns, picturesque walkways and mature hedging, trees and shrubs.

The 
mansion, which is set in four acres of land, was originally a wedding 
present from Captain AAR Hennessy, the French cognac magnate, to his 
young bride.

Designed by the influential architect Sir Reginald Blomfield, it took two years to build and was completed in 1905.

The
 property is currently run as a B&B and wedding venue 
(saltcote.co.uk), and the bridal suite is named The Hennessy Suite after
 its romantic inception.
