A woman whose granddaughter died after her head was crushed with forceps during a botched delivery has described the chaotic scene as medical staff struggled to deliver the baby girl.

Angie Coats was in the delivery room at a Texas hospital with her son Allen and his fiance Rachel Melancon, 24, when she said she
 heard a popping noise that sounded like pottery cracking while Dr 
George Backardjiev was using forceps to guide the baby's head into the 
birth canal.

There was no 
cry of life when Olivia Marie was finally born via c-section. The 
heavily brain-damaged newborn never took a breath on her own and only 
lived for five more days on life support before passing away.

Exhausted: The family of deceased newborn Olivia Marie Coats say the doctor who performed her delivery was falling asleep in the corridor before labor

Damage: Baby Olivia was born with a fractured skull and broken spinal cord, which left her brain damaged

After burying her granddaughter Saturday, Ms Coats spoke with MailOnline to describe the terrifying scene that unfolded before her.

Dr Backardjiev had also delivered Coats' daughter's baby just one month 
prior so she was familiar with him even before Ms Melancon went into 
delivery on December 28.

From the beginning both she and 
Melancon told him they wanted to do a c-section because of the mother's 
petite frame and the baby's large size, but he insisted on trying a 
natural birth because a c-section would leave a scar, ABC News reported.

As each 
hour passed of her 18 hour labor, the family continued to ask for a 
c-section but Dr Backardjiev kept pushing it off just a little while 
longer.

Devastating: Baby Olivia was kept on life support for five days before she finally died

Heartbroken: Allen Coats and Rachel Melancon with baby Olivia whose skull was crushed during an attempted forceps delivery

In a forceps delivery a metal instrument, shaped like salad tongs, is clamped around the baby's head.

They are used to either guide the baby out the birth canal or, if the baby is facing the wrong way, to rotate the baby.

The
 mother is generally given an episiotomy - an incision from the vagina 
to the anus - as there is an increased likelihood of tearing.

It
 is considered a risky delivery, with the Mayo Clinic reminding 
expectant mothers that generally when a forceps delivery is recommended a
 C-Section is also an option.

In the mother, forceps can cause long-term urinary or fecal incontinence; genital tears; and damage to the uterus or bladder.

For babies, forceps can cause fractures, bleeding within the skull and facial injuries.

That's
 when he attempted to position the baby for delivery with 
forceps.

'He was pulling and twisting,' Ms Coats said. 'We kept telling him the baby isn't going to 
come out - itâ€™s too big. She wasn't turned the right way. He was trying to pull her out and turn her.

'And you can't stop him in the middle because you think the doctor knows what he's doing.'

But as he continued to pull, the family heard the pop, she said.

'When
 he touched the top and side of the skull, we heard a pop, like clay 
cracking in pottery and I heard her skull crush,' she said. 'It was awful - I was holding her leg and I was crying.'

At 
that moment, Dr Backardjiev turned to Ms Coats and said: 'It's the same 
situation as your daughter, just her pelvis was bigger', she said.

When he led the delivery on Ms Coats' daughter a month before, Dr Backardjiev 
used forceps as well but the baby came out. This time though, the baby 
wasn't going to fit.

Ms Melancon was taken into the operating 
room for a c-section and as soon as her baby was born, she was taken to 
another hospital for special treatment for the fractured skull and 
severed spinal cord she sustained in birth.

Tribute: At the funeral held on Saturday, mourners celebrated baby Olivia's short life by releasing hundreds of balloons into the overcast sky

Hope: Rachel had experienced a healthy pregnancy and the couple were looking forward to their baby's arrival

While Ms Coats and 
her son traveled to Houston with the baby, Ms Melancon had to stay 
behind and rest. Dr Backardjiev came into her room after the procedure 
and was told by a family friend there that they wanted a new doctor.

According
 to Ms Coats, Dr Backardjiev has not issued an apology to the family 
though a member of his staff told 12 News that he is 'distraught' over 
Olivia's death.

Dr Backardjiev did not return MailOnline's call for comment.

What's most upsetting for the family is that the situation was out of their hands. 

Hard Day: Rachel Melancon and Allen Coats buried their five-day-old daughter today, who died after suffering injuries during birth caused by forceps

Letting go: Olivia's parents, who kept a vigil at her bedside, donated her heart valve to save another baby

'We
 didn't have a choice of forceps or a c-section,' Ms Coats said. 'We never had an option 
to say no or even explain, "Hey this is what can happen when you use 
forceps". We never got that option.'

While
 the parents are 
planning on suing the obstetrician, they're more interested in raising 
awareness of the dangers of forceps so that other healthy babies don't 
suffer the same fate as Olivia. They have set up a Facebook group to spread the word.

While this has been a 
heartbreaking period in their lives, the two still plan to get married 
and buy a home together. They're going to wait a year for Ms Melancon to 
heal and then try for more children. Olivia Marie was both 
of the parents first child.
