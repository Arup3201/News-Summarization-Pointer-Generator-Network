Gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' daughters say their mother is 'dedicated' amidst claims that she had 'abandoned' them while attending Harvard Law School.

The Fort Worth, Texas Democrat received claims on social media saying she left her daughters behind on her climb to the top and that she 'lost custody of them' after divorcing her husband Jeff Davis.

Daughters Amber Davis, 31, and Dru Davis, 25, can only say wonderful things about the woman they say was 'remarkable.'

How could they say that? Davis is appalled over the rumors circulating about her on social media

Dru Davis spoke passionately in her open letter, reports the Austin American Statesman.

'I hate that I feel the need to write this, but I have been reading and hearing so many untrue things about my mom and I want to set the record straight,'said Davis.

'And sadly I feel the need to be crystal clear on the malicious and false charge of abandonment as nothing could be further from the truth. My mom has always shared equally in the care and custody of my sister and me.'

Amber also addressed the libelous social media claims saying that her mother wasn't up to par.

'I have spent the past few days reading the ludicrous comments that people have shared on social media about my mother and our family. It is a shame that those who don’t know us feel the need to comment on the details of our lives as if they’ve lived them. I have a hard time understanding how such hate and negativity can result from one person’s false accusations.'

Both Davis' daughters stand by their mother's story that she grew up in a Fort Worth Trailer Park and that she fought her way to becoming a student at Harvard Law.

A story that appeared on the Dallas Morning News on January 19 found flaws with the narrative of  Davis' life story.

Twitter users including Bristol Palin claim that Davis lied about how long she lived in a trailer and how much financial aid she received from her husband for school, reports the Washington Post.

Davis believes that her republican opposition Attorney General Greg Abbott is to blame for the negative stories and claims that she fabricated her own life story.

In addressing the issue of how long her mother lived on a trailer she said, 'My mother had me when she was very young, a kid herself. And although she was married for a short period of time, parenthood was her sole responsibility. Yes, we lived in a trailer. Does it matter how long? Not to me.'

Dru Davis had firmly stood by her mother and says that she was always a good parent, even though she took time to further her career after they were born.

'Yes, she went to law school after my sister and I were born. We lived with her the first semester, but I had severe asthma and the weather there wasn’t good for me. My parents made a decision for my sister and me to stay in Texas while my mom kept going to school. But that doesn’t mean she wasn’t there for us.'

Dru says that her mother always had custody of them following the divorce and that the custody was shared equally between parents. The letters from her daughters came right before Davis went on Fusion television with Jorge Ramos on Monday.

'Those allegations are really absurd, Jorge,' she said. 'My life story is my life story. I am a young woman who had lived in poverty for many years before I was able to work and lift myself out of that place, and I know that there are Texans across the state that are facing the same challenges that I once faced.'

Davis has raised $12 million for her campaign and is trailing behind Attorney General Greg Abbott who raised $27 million.

Davis only gained 34 per cent of voters as Abbot got 40 per cent. 25 per cent are undecided.
