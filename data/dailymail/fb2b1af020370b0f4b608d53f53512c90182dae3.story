Newcastle United fans are all doing a jig by the Tyne right now. They have just been given a gift for Christmas and a Happy New Year all in one.

I don't know one Newcastle fan who wanted Pardew to stay, so they are delighted Crystal Palace have obliged and taken him off their hands.

But there is a downside to this that must surely hurt even the most passionate member of the anti-Alan Pardew brigade.

Newcastle United's stock is low. As a football club its standing is tumbling down to what could be an all-time low. I'm not talking about league position – I'm talking about how the club is viewed globally. 

It's clear they are not one of the big boys. It's clear that under Mike Ashley's guardianship Newcastle United are also-rans at best, and certainly not a club that's likely to attract a top manager.

Tyneside times are so hard right now, that a third-rate manager has chosen to extricate himself from the remaining six years of his contract, despite the fact that atrocious results and a truly appalling record in the FA and League Cups suggested there was no imminent indication he was likely to get the sack.

To make it even worse, Pardew hasn't been tempted by Chelsea or Inter Milan. He's chosen Crystal Palace.

The stadium is one of the worst in the Premier League, the budget was so bad even Tony Pulis chose unemployment rather than stay there, and there's far more likelihood Palace will be heading down to the Championship rather than Newcastle. And yet Pardew would rather be in Croydon than the north east.

Of course there may be other reasons for this switch. Reasons which have yet to emerge. But from the information we have it is a move from Pardew which shows that Newcastle United is not an attractive proposition.

Around a year ago he enjoyed a run of seven wins in nine at Newcastle. They were flying, and playing some great football.

But then Yohan Cabaye was sold against the manager's wishes, he wasn't replaced and Newcastle United's season fell apart.

And the truth is this: unless you have something special as a manager (in his 10 years of management Pardew hasn't shown us anything yet – he's been decent and no more), there is little chance of success at Newcastle United.

The 'buy cheap – sell big' policy at Newcastle works from a business point of view, but leaves success-starved fans frustrated.

And there are plenty of them: 52,000 crazed Geordies packing the stadium out every home game, and a passionate away following.

They must be overjoyed Pardew has left.

But at the same time it's confirmation of what some of us have believed for a little while now – the only thing big about Newcastle United Football Club is the support of the fans.

Fairplay to Crystal Palace for getting the man they wanted. But to see that manager choose Palace rather than stay at St James' Park shows just how far Newcastle United have sunk as a club under the current regime.
