A 32st sumo wrestler who has spent 30 years and £9,000 learning to drive claims she can't pass her test because she is unable to fit in the instructors' cars.

Professional wrestler Sharran Alexander, from London, has had 10 instructors turn her away from driving lessons because she was unable to squeeze behind the wheel of their vehicles.

She has already spent £9,000 trying to gain her driving licence - and has even sat the driving test five times, spending £62 on each go, with no success.

The smallest car Miss Alexander  can squeeze into is a Ford Focus, but she says many instructors have just refused to teach her due to her size and difficulty in fitting behind the wheel.

And even when she has been able to get behind the wheel for the test, she says her nerves get the better of her.

Miss Alexander explained: 'I'm six foot tall and the cars people learn to drive in are just too small.

'When I book a lesson with a new instructor I always tell them "I'm as big as sumo wrestler" but I don't think they take me literally!

'In the last few years I'm sure they've even got smaller.

'Even when I try and warn instructors on the phone by saying that I'm a big person and there needs to be room for two giants it has gone wrong.

'I once went all the way to Eastbourne in the hope of an instructor who would fit me in - but when I arrived the seatbelt didn't go round me and I had to buy a seatbelt extender.

'Ten instructors have just flat out said no. They're never rude, they always try and help but I've been told if the steering wheel doesn't turn freely in front of me it's just not safe for me to drive.

'And more than once I've turned up and, even though I've fitted into the car, the instructor hasn't been able to get in after me.

'It makes me nervous that I'm not cut out to drive and I really suffer with nerves - it's just so difficult under pressure.

Miss Alexander has so far been unable to gain her driving licence despite sitting the test five times

Miss Alexander has admitted that during the driving test, she suffers from nerves and says when it comes to the test, she just 'goes to pieces' 

'Whether I've been doing the most recent set of lessons for six months or six years I still have the same nerve problems

'When it comes to the test I just go to pieces.' 

But even when Miss Alexander has been able to make it behind the wheels of a car, she has struggled to make it out of first gear.

This is despite spending a year taking classes with the AA costing £1700, doing three at intensive courses at £750 a time and having lessons with another six private instructors over the years.

However, she still manages to clock up both majors and minors, when it comes to sitting the test.

At the moment she has to spend £100 a day on taxis to so she can visit her parents, who are ill and live on opposite sides of London, to care for them.

After realising that it was unsustainable to spend so much money, she has now signed up for an intervention and is currently being taught to drive by instructor Ursula Young from the ITV show Undrivables.

Miss Alexander explained: 'I was spending hundreds on taxis every week and I realised that if I had a car things would be so much easier so I started trying to learn again without much luck.

'Desperate times called for desperate measures and I knew I needed professional help so I signed up for the show.

'Ursula has given me the confidence and brought me faith in myself to believe that when I finally get to take the test - I'll be ready.

'I fell down the stairs during filming and ended up on crutches so I couldn't take the test before the show ended.

'But Ursula is still in touch and helping me get back in the car - that's just the kind of person she is. She wants to see me succeed.

'It's crazy thinking about it. I've had hundreds of lessons and spent thousands of pounds and I'm still waiting to pass.'
