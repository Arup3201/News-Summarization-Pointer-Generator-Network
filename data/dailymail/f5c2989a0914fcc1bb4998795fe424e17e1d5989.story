Missing: Retired teacher Carol Sheridan, 73, has not been seen since she left her home in France on Sunday to embark on a hike in the Alps

A family have issued a desperate appeal to find a British great-grandmother who has gone missing in the French Alps.

Retired teacher Carol Sheridan, 73, has not been seen since she left the picturesque village of Habere-Poche at 1pm on Sunday after telling friends she was going for a drive and then a hike in the Alps.

Police are now desperately hunting for her black Fiat Panda, but say they do not know where to concentrate their search as the grandmother did not tell anyone where she was going.

The mother-of-two, who has previously lived in Monte Carlo and is a fluent French speaker, usually contacts family and friends daily via social networking sites, e-mail and telephone, but no-one has heard anything from her for almost a week.

Her daughter Fiona Conyers, who lives in New Zealand, has co-ordinated a poster campaign and informed French radio stations, locals from the village and is now reaching out to the mountain community online.

She said: 'Our main focus at this point is to find her car.

'The area in which she is thought to be missing is vast.

'We are relying on the public to help us find the car. If we find the car, we find mum, it's that simple.'

Mrs Sheridan, a grandmother-of-ten and
great-grandmother-of-four, moved to France from her home in Driffield, 
East Yorks, two years ago.

She was last seen by her neighbour as she drove off in her car to embark on her walk in the Alps.

Mrs Sheridan's grandaughter, Heather Tanton, 25, said: 'This is just so out of character for my nan. She'd never go this long without telling us where she is.

'She'd know we'd be worried and mainly she'd love to be showing off pictures of what she'd been doing, so to not hear from her is really worrying.

'She speaks to her daughter in New Zealand every day.

'She
puts pictures of places she's been and hills she's climbed on Facebook 
every day, showing all her friends what she's been up to.'

She said the family have 'been through all the emotions' but are trying to stay positive.

Miss Tanton, who lives with 28-year-old partner Mark Owen, a plumber, and their two daughters Zara, four, and two-year-old Sophie in Brough, East Yorkshire, said: 'She's fit as a fiddle and so resourceful and I'm hoping that's what's keeping her going wherever she is.

'She isn't your normal 73-year-old - she's like Bear Grylls, she can light a fire anywhere and will eat anything.'

Picturesque: Mrs Sheridan settled in Habere-Poche, a small village of just over 1,000 people in the Rhone-Alps region of the country, close to its border with Switzerland and around 80km from Mont Blanc (above)

Mrs Sheridan, who divorced in her late 30s, was a school teacher for years and worked more recently as a conveyancer and tax inspector before she retired.

She returned to Driffield a few years ago to look after Heather's mother Elaine who fell ill before moving back out to France.

She settled in Habere-Poche, a small village of just over 1,000 people in the Rhone-Alps region of the country, close to its border with Switzerland and around 80km from Mont Blanc.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed they are helping Mrs Sheridan's family.

He said: 'We are aware that a British national has been reported missing in France.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family.'
