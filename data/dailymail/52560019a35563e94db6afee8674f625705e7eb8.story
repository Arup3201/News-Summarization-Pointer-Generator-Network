Claims: Former spin doctor Damian McBride leaves a Travelodge and heads to his news night interview

Damian McBride last night branded Labour critics of his sensational memoir as hypocrites.

Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor said his accusers were ‘not entirely innocent themselves’ when it came to the party’s toxic culture of spin  and smear.

And he said Labour’s leaders could have minimised the damage to their conference this week by responding better to the revelations in his book.

The memoir, which is being serialised in the Daily Mail, has cast a long shadow over the Brighton gathering and lifted the lid on years of feuding, media manipulation and character assassination.

Both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who were at the heart of the political operation run by Mr Brown, have scrambled to distance themselves from their former friend and colleague.

Mr McBride told the Mail he was prepared to accept criticism of his misdeeds from new MPs such as Rachel Reeves and Chuka Umunna.

But he added: ‘Other people were quite closely involved in these years – and are not entirely innocent themselves. It’s a bit hard to take.

‘Maybe it’s because some people have got old scores to settle that there’s a feeling that this is a chance to give me a kicking – and by extension give some old enemies a kicking.’

Mr McBride singled out Tony Blair’s former spin chief Alastair Campbell and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, whose allies he blames for leaking a damaging story that Mr Brown was snubbed five times by Barack Obama.

Leadership: Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, pictured at their party conference in Brighton, have tried to distance themselves from their former colleague and friend since the revelations were published in McBride's memoirs

He
said he was surprised by the frenzy that greeted his revelations, and 
risked further antagonising former colleagues  by criticising how they 
have reacted to them.

He 
said the party should have adopted the same approach he ordered when 
former Labour general secretary Peter Watt published a damaging book on 
the eve of one of Mr Brown’s conferences.

‘The
line from day one should have been: “We’re not going to help Mr McBride
sell his book and we have far more important things to discuss”,’ he 
said. ‘Why it wasn’t, I don’t know. They’re stoking it up 
unnecessarily.’

He 
attacked allies of Mr Miliband he believes were behind a lurid weekend 
story saying he had once claimed to have had an alcohol-fuelled 
one-night stand with a female minister.

‘All
I really made of that was “talk about holier than thou”. I’m not going 
to complain about these things.

'But it’s interesting that the first 
reaction of someone, somewhere, to my book was to try to do some 
damaging story about my personal life,’ he said.

Allegations: Mr McBride singled out Alastair Campbell and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, whose allies he blames for leaking a deeply story about how Mr Brown was snubbed when he requested a meeting with Barack Obama

He
repeated his warning to Mr Miliband about potentially damaging emails 
the Labour leader is said to have sent to Derek Draper, a Labour 
campaigner at the centre of the smear campaign against  senior Tories 
that finally forced Mr McBride’s resignation in 2009.

‘Every time we think we’ve seen the last of the Draper emails, we see another one. I would be a little bit concerned,’ he said.

Mr
McBride said he had not heard from Mr Brown, his former boss, since 
extracts from his book began to be published. Yesterday, asked in New 
York for his reaction, the former prime minister refused to comment. 

‘He
will be both angry at some of the revelations and angry at the 
assumption that there is guilt by association,’ Mr McBride said.

'I 
regret that he will be feeling like that. But I don’t think there was a 
way to tell my story without being open about this stuff.

‘Some
people said “Whatever you do, don’t own up to x, y, z”.

But others said
if I didn’t admit the things I did, if I wasn’t honest about it, then 
people would come out and destroy my credibility.’

Mr McBride 
dismissed claims from Mr Campbell and others that his antics, and those 
of Mr Brown’s other supporters, cost Labour the last general election.

In
a separate interview for the BBC’s Newsnight programme, Mr McBride 
warned that ‘any sense of disunity or disagreement between Mr Miliband 
and Mr Balls – any repeat of the Blair-Brown feud – would be fatal to 
Labour’s election chances’.

‘If anything, I hope my book will act as a 
sobering reminder of those risks,’ he added.

Mr
Campbell said: ‘A narrative was fed to the public, day in day out, that
Tony Blair wasn’t very good at his job, that any minister that was very
good at his job and thereby seen as a threat by people like [Charlie] 
Whelan and McBride were consistently briefed against.

much as I despise McBride and all he stands for, if all you journalists stopped reporting gossip from un-attributable 'sources close to', and actually did a bit of research, all this nonsense would stop.

You can say what you like about Gordon and Tony but the simple truth is: that Britain was a much more civilized, modern, tolerant and socially progressive nation in 2010 vs 1997. The hope which we all had on that glorious Mayday 16 years ago was fulfilled.

McBride: the greasy hair, the bad skin, the red face, the half-mast trousers, the stumbling, the hatred, the rambling- most people KNOW what these are indicators of. If I named the problem, I won't get "published"

Freeze energy bills? Miliband must be joking. He knows, just as Cameron  knows that energy companies are tax collectors for the government. The more profits energy companies make, the more tax they pay.

Whatever Mc Bride did is insignificant compared to Campbell, this man's lying and bullying cost thousands of peoples lives, how does he live with himself ?

At the end of the day Mr McBride, ITS ALL ABOUT MONEY WITH YOU AND HOW MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE..You should be thankful you live in the UK because in a lot of countries you would have just  DISAPPEARED..

Yeah- he's sad. But wouldn't it have been nicer if Brown had actually spent time "governing" and Blair hadn't had his thing stopping the NHS reporting TRUE figures, and the police, and the Defence Procurement fiascos - and the rest- reporting THE TRUTH: instead he had his obsession about making WAR- his "international statesman" thing (warmonger with Bush)

We only have our selves to blame for repeatedly voting for them and making seemingly untouchable career politions of them, so why not make a change and vote UKIP.  PS, I am a UKIP member so be happy for me.

Unlikely as it was this odious henchman would have probably recieved an honour had Brown won the last election.Now he is collecting his 30 pieces of silver for betraying his former boss.Not that i have sympathy with labour,if get an attack dog you have to feed it otherwise it will attack you.
