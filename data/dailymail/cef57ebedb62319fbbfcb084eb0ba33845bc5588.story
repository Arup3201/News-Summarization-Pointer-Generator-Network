An adorable baby orangutan born following an extremely rare primate C-section has given her first wave.

Pictured moments after her birth on January 7, the newborn - who is yet to be named - is seen feeding from a bottle and cuddling up to staff at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center.

Markisa, a 27 year-old Sumatran Orangutan, gave birth to the infant, who weighed a healthy 3.45 pounds. 

After the birth, she recovered from the procedure back at her home in Como Zoo while her baby received medical attention in hospital.

Hello world! The baby orangutan, who is yet to be named, was born following an extremely rare primate C-section in Minnesota this month

It's a girl! Markisa, a 27 year-old Sumatran Orangutan, gave birth at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center on January 7

Adorable: The newborn orangutan weighed a healthy 3.45 pounds but was cared for in an ICU while her mother recovered at Como Zoo

The baby orangutan was delivered by Dr Micky Trent with the consultation of an extensive medical team as it was Markisa's second required C-section, both of which were performed at the Veterinary Medical Center. 

Como Zoo primate keeper Megan Elder said: 'C-sections are very rare in that there are only about a dozen recorded within the International Orangutan Studbook that has tracked more than 1,200 births in captivity throughout history.'

This is a very important birth both for the zoo and the species. 

Markisa was recommended for breeding by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Orangutan Species Survival Plan because of her status as one of the most genetically valuable female Sumatran orangutans in North America.

In her first weeks, the infant was cared for in an ICU at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center and looked after by primate experts from the zoo - and the plan is for her to be slowly reacquainted with her mother.

The newborn was bottle-fed by zoo staff during the time she is separated from Markisa.

The Association of Zoos and Aquariums governs a Species Survival Plan for endangered species in captivity in the United States. 

The committee that supervises the SSP for orangutans set guidelines and recommendations each year to manage the captive population. 

Como Campus Manager Michelle Furrer said: 'The SSP provides good zoo homes for each animal and helps to maintain a diverse gene pool within the zoo community'

'The zoo will work with the SSP to ensure that this animal becomes a healthy addition to the zoo population.'

About 200 orangutans are currently on exhibit in zoos throughout the U.S. Their native population, found primarily in Sumatra and Borneo, has dwindled due to commercial logging, agriculture, hunting and poaching - all of which put the species under the threat of extinction.
