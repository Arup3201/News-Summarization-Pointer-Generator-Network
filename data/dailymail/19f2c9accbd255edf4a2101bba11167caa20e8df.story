A father of seven called his wife to ask if she loved him any more and died after starting an explosion in his garage when she told him she didn't, an inquest heard.

Stuart Mathers, 42, died instantly in the fire which tore through the garage at his home in Kingswood, Hull, Hull Coroner's Court was told.

The inquest into his death heard that his marriage to Natalie, a police officer, was 'coming to an end' when he called her in the early hours of June 11 this year.

Stuart Mathers, 42, asked his wife if she loved him and started a fire which killed him when she said 'No'

Scene: Mr Mathers died in a fire in the garage next to his house in Kingswood, Hull, earlier this year

Mrs Mathers said: 'Our marriage was coming to an end.  I told Stuart that evening that it was over and then I left earlier than normal to start my 10pm shift at work, at about 8.30pm.

'I had a missed call from him when I was on duty at just gone midnight and I called him back.  He answered, before saying: "Do you love me?"

When Mrs Mathers arrived home she tried to get into the house to save Mr Mathers, but found the front door was locked

'I said "No" and that it was not about that.  

'He immediately replied with: "Right then, the dog is outside and there is a fire at our house".

'He was very serious and blunt and I believed he was going to do it.'

When Mrs Mathers arrived home at 12.30am she found the garage in flames and her neighbours, who had been woken by explosions coming from the garage, on the street.

She said she desperately tried to get into the house but the front door was locked and a neighbour dragged her away from the burning building.

Police officers who had arrived at the scene eventually forced entry into the house and began searching for Mr Mathers, a doorman, but his body was found beneath rubble in the garage by firefighters tackling the blaze.

The inquest heard that Mr Mathers, who had been drinking alcohol before he died, had left a note for his wife on a worktop in the kitchen, along with a wedding ring and a number of £20 notes.

Mrs Mathers said: 'I never thought Stuart would do anything as extreme as that.. What he did was completely out of character.'

Debbie Mathers, his sister, told the inquest he had called her numerous times in the hours before his death to arrange for a taxi to deliver his things to her house.

He told her: 'You will be receiving some of my belongings soon. You know what to do with them.'

Miss Mathers said: 'We had several phone conversations on the Tuesday night. Stuart had been drinking but he didn't seem drunk. He was adamant that his relationship was over and he was down about that.

'They had split up the week before but they got back together.

'When a taxi pulled up outside my house with his stuff inside, I just thought he was going to move out of their home.

'What he did was so out of character. He was a lovely man - respected by all.'

Stephen Henry, from Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Both doors to the garage had been locked from inside and both sets of keys were found on Stuart.

'I believe the explosion would have been very big and it is likely he died instantly.'

On the night he died, Mr Mathers had met his daughter from a previous marriage to give her £90 for her birthday, the court heard.

Delivering a narrative verdict, assistant coroner David Rosenburg said: 'Stuart Mathers took his own life while suffering severe emotional stress and under the influence of alcohol so he would not have appreciated the consequences of his actions.

'I commend the police officers and firemen who responded so quickly in trying to save Mr Mathers and stopping the fire spreading further.'
