A trip to Denny's turned into a nightmare for two Wisconsin parents after their three-year-old son stepped onto an unsecured manhole cover and fell into a grease pit.

Wyatt Scharenbroch was on the sidewalk next to the restaurant when he asked them if he could jump on a green manhole cover nearby.

After his mother Alana told him not to, as it looked wet and slippery, Wyatt angrily stomped his foot down on the lid, which suddenly flew up in the air.

The startled boy then lost his balance and fell into the four-foot wide pit.

'It was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life,' she told the Appleton Post Crescent.  

Mrs Scharenbroch said she immediately reached inside to try and grab hold of her son when she was hit by a stench that 'smelled like sewage' and a darkness that made it impossible to tell just how deep the hole was.

'I didn't know if it was a contained tube,' she said. 'I thought he was going to get flushed to the lake or sewer forever.' 

But the child's father, Dan Scharenbroch, was able to pull Wyatt out after grabbing hold of the hood of his jacket.

The parents brought their son inside the Grand Chute Denny's, where Mrs Scharenbroch said nearby diners helped wipe the boy down and offered their own water bottles, diaper bags and clean clothes.

Wyatt was then taken by ambulance to St Elizabeth Hospital in Appleton for treatment, where he was held for monitoring because he had swallowed some  waste while stuck inside the pit.

Mrs Scharenbroch said her son has recovered physically after receiving some scrapes and cuts from the fall but is now 'extremely cautious and very clingy,' which she said is unusual for Wyatt.

Assistant Fire Chief Michael DeBruler said the covers should have been secured and the biggest risk of such an incident would have been the possibility of drowning.

'Fortunately the parents were right there and able to pull the boy to safety,' he said. 'They had him out prior to our arrival.' 

Mr DeBruler said most restaurants use 'a third-party company' to pump out the grease pits on a regular basis and that it was 'unclear' if it was the company or the restaurant's responsibility to inspect whether the manhole covers are secured.

The grease pit is emptied every four to six weeks, according to Madison-based Denny's area manager Mark Enders. 

Firefighters who responded to the incident worked with Denny's after the boy was rescued to secure the covers. 

Mr Enders said the restaurant is investigating why the covers weren't secured and is working with the vendor that services the grease pit to make sure the incident doesn't happen again.

Wyatt tripped into a container similar to this one and suffered scrapes and cuts from the fall. His mother Alana said the trauma from the fall has made him 'extremely cautious'
