Forensic scientists in Colombia are embarking on a huge project to identify the remains of 500 children who were taken by guerrilla fighters and later found in mass unmarked graves.

Their investigations have identified one girl through her bones as the victim of a bombing, after she had been missing for more than a decade after being taken by leftist rebels from her home aged 14.

It comes more than 10 years after she was taken and died at a camp run by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the main guerrilla group in Colombia that has recruited child fighters.

Identifying: A worker at Colombia's Institute of Forensic Medicine organises the remains of a young woman recruited by a guerrilla group

Huge effort: The institute has now begun a big project to identify the remains of children from mass graves

Project: Around six forensic experts are using the latest technology to compare DNA profiles obtained from remains of around 500 victims with samples from possible relatives

Forensic analysis was carried out by 
Colombia's Institute of Forensic Medicine at the request of her family, 
who believed the FARC had taken her and she could have been among the 
dead.

Pedro Morales, the institute’s deputy 
director, said: ‘We have a slogan: life took them from us and death 
brings them back to us.’

The
 institute has now begun a project to identify the remains of 
children from mass graves, with more than 17,000 children having gone 
missing during Latin America's longest-running insurgency.

Around
 six forensic experts are using the latest technology to compare DNA 
profiles obtained from remains of around 500 victims with samples from 
possible relatives.

Difficult task: Complicating the project, there is no national database of genetic information in Columbia

Scientific: Experts say identifying remains through DNA is far more difficult than TV shows make it seem, particularly in Colombia, where acidic soil and a hot and humid climate speed up the deterioration of the bones

Tricky job: Children have a lower concentration of the minerals that protect bones than adults, which leaves them more vulnerable to decomposition

In one case, a girl was conscripted by
 the far-right United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) paramilitary
 group and murdered in 2003, according to testimony from an demobilised 
fighter.

Her remains, 
partially decomposed after eight years in a grave, are resting on the 
table of anthropologist Lauro Polo, of the institute's laboratory in the
 central Colombian city of Villavicencio.

‘She
 was executed between August and October 2003 by members of the AUC with
 a shot to the head,’ and she was ‘dismembered to hide the evidence,’ 
explained Ms Polo, while holding the destroyed skull of the young girl 
in her gloved hands.

A sample was taken from one of the bones to compare the DNA with that of her paternal grandmother.

Horror: More than 17,000 children having gone missing during Latin America's longest-running insurgency

Tragic: Children were often taken from his or her village by armed groups, and their families didn't see them again until they appeared years later in mass graves or unmarked graves in cemeteries

In most of the cases Ms Polo has worked on, she said, the child was taken from his or her village by armed groups, and their families didn't see them again until they appeared years later in mass graves or unmarked graves in cemeteries.

The experts in Villavicencio emphasise that identifying remains through DNA is far more difficult than TV shows make it seem, particularly in Colombia, where acidic soil and a hot and humid climate speed up the deterioration of the bones.

Children also have a lower concentration of the minerals that protect bones than adults, which leaves them more vulnerable to decomposition.

Further complicating the project, there is no national database of genetic information.
