A primary school teacher lost the ability to read after suffering a stroke - but is still able to write.

The woman, known only as 40-year-old M.P., developed ‘word blindness’ as a result of the stroke.

The rare condition is thought to occur when the brain’s language zone is robbed of its visual inputs but remains intact.

A 40-year-old primary school teacher lost the ability to read after suffering a stroke. However, she can still write and understand speech. Image shows an MRI of the woman's brain.

Both have been affected by the stroke

M.P. entered her classroom one morning in October 2012 and discovered she was unable to read the names on the register.

In a panic, she then turned to her lesson plans and discovered that they, too, looked like ‘hieroglyphs’.

M.P. went to see the school’s head teacher who was equally baffled and sent her to stay with her mother.

During the following two days, M.P. began to experience further problems.

She could no longer tell the time and it took her several hours to pack a travel bag.

She also started to have difficulty finding words and she became confused and anxious.

Her mother took her to hospital where she was admitted and diagnosed with a stroke.

Ten months after her stroke, M.P. was still unable to read but had learnt to decipher words by tracing each letter with her finger. The large arrow in the image shows a blockage in one of the arteries in M.P.'s brain. The small arrow shows constrictions and dilations in another artery

M.P. was found to be suffering from alexia without agraphia – or ‘word blindness’ – a rare condition which causes people to lose the ability to read, but without impeding their ability to write and to understand speech.

The condition developed as a result of the stroke she suffered.

It is believed to be caused by lesions in the brain’s ‘language zone’ and occurs when this part of the brain is robbed of its visual inputs but, otherwise, remains intact.

Following the stroke, M.P. tried to teach herself to read again but her efforts were met with little success.

She employed the skills she had learnt as a primary school teacher and used flashcards and writing exercises to try and improve her condition. However, her efforts failed.

Determined not to give up, she discovered she could decipher a word by tracing each individual letter with her finger.

Writing in the journal Neurology, her doctors explained: ‘Given a word, M.P. will direct her attention to the first letter, which she is unable to recognise.

‘She will then place her finger on the letter and begin to trace each letter of the alphabet over it in order until she recognises that she has traced the letter she is looking at.

‘“That is the letter M,” she declares, after tracing the previous 12 letters of the alphabet with her finger while deciphering a word in front of her.

‘Three letters later, she is able to shorten this exercise with a guess - “This word is mother,” she announces proudly.’

While M.P. is not able to read, some words still elicit an emotional response from her.

For example, when shown the word 
‘dessert’ she said ‘oooh, I like that’ and when shown the word 
‘asparagus’ she said ‘something’s upsetting me about this word’.

M.P., who was a teacher, says the thing she misses most is being able to read to children (file picture)

According to the doctors treating M.P., even 10 months after her stroke she was still unable to read.

She told them she misses reading books to children.

She said: ‘One day my mom was with the kids in the family, and they were all curled up next to each other, and they were reading. And I started to cry, because that was something I couldn't do.

‘I could be there, but I couldn't pick up the book and read it. That's something that I'd always done, and it's something I had a lot of pleasure from. And I couldn't do it.’

M.P. had to give up teaching and now works at a fitness centre.

She is planning to write a book about her experiences in an attempt to raise money for stroke research.
