At this year's British Nylon Fair it was revealed that two-thirds of teenagers are knitters.

It's official: all the cool kids are putting down their XBox controls and picking up needles.

Knitting needles, that is.

At this year's British Nylon Fair it was revealed that two-thirds of all teenagers are knitters.

And in the wake of this trend for all things make-do-and-mend, a luxury alpaca wool brand has released a selection of knitting kits made especially for teenagers - just in time for Christmas.

Toft Alpaca have created ready-to-knit gift packs especially for teenage creatives.

The company have created a range of teen-specific DIY packages with which young people can make cosy knitted goodies.

The kits - which can also be bought as ready-to-wear for an inflated price if you are not up to the challenge of knitting - include beanie hats, wrist-warmers, leg-warmers, bed socks, scarves and snoods.

Free from chemicals and dying processes, the kits are 100 per cent organic.

Though the kits come with instructions, there are also YouTube tutorials online for those who need some extra guidance.

The teenage specific kits start at £15 for a beginners cable beret (£69 for ready-to-wear) and stretch to £45 (£120) for a bobble scarf and £50 (£120) for a moss snood.
