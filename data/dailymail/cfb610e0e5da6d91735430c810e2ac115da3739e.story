It was a big night for musician James Morgan, conducting an orchestra for a prestigious concert in Denmark as television cameras rolled in the background. But during this performance his life changed for ever.

His left hand had been trembling uncontrollably. It wasn’t the first time – it had been happening on and off for several months, but he had ignored it. As he stepped off the stage, one musician asked: ‘What’s going on with your hand?’

‘I looked down and couldn’t stop it shaking. If other people were starting to notice, I had to do something about it.’

James, who was 42 at the time and has worked with Katherine Jenkins and Alfie Boe, initially blamed the tremors on drinking too much red wine, and he cut out alcohol. It didn’t work. Although he had been suffering neck and back pains for more than four years and kept crying out in his sleep, he never imagined it was linked to his shaking hand.

‘I thought they were just stress dreams,’ he says as he sits in the music room of his Sussex home  with wife Juliette Pochin, 42, the glamorous mezzo soprano.

In October 2012, James’s GP referred him to a neurologist, who sent him for an MRI scan to check for brain tumours. It came back clear. Next, he had a series of tests.

‘I had to establish how quickly I could move my fingers, putting my hands in front of me to see if one side reacted more slowly than the other. The doctor noted weakness, shaking and slow reactions in my left hand. He also noticed that when I walked, my left arm didn’t swing – a classic sign, I later learned, of the diagnosis that would soon follow. The fact that I didn’t blink much and my left leg shook were also clues.’

James had feared it was Parkinson’s, and when this was confirmed he was devastated.

‘When the consultant phoned, I somehow knew. I wasn’t surprised, but I was shocked. My first reaction was a mixture of denial and panic,’ says James. ‘I just thought, “I’m a working dad with three kids. How is this going to impact everyone else? I need to support my children.” ’

Popular perception of Parkinson’s is that it affects the elderly, but it can be diagnosed at any age, with one in 20 sufferers being under 40. Of 127,000 Britons with the disease, more than 6,000 were diagnosed before their 40th birthday.

‘Parkinson’s causes the nerve cells in the brain that make the chemical dopamine to struggle, be damaged and eventually die,’ explains Claire Bale, from Parkinson’s UK.

‘These nerve cells are mainly in a part of the brain involved in movement, so they can’t get messages through and people start to develop problems with movement. For example walking is more laboured.’

As the condition progresses, it can affect talking, digesting, writing, mood and sleep, as dopamine is also in part responsible for these.

‘Although Young Onset Parkinson’s is very similar in many ways, we tend to find that in younger people the condition progresses more slowly and they respond better to the drugs,’ adds Claire.

There is no specific blood test for Parkinson’s. In James’s case, his neurologist’s diagnosis was confirmed by a DaTscan, which measures how much dopamine is available in the brain. It showed the right side of his brain, which affects the left side of the body, wasn’t properly producing the chemical.

Juliette immediately went into practical mode, phoning her mother to come and pick up the kids so she and James could spend the next few days frantically learning everything they could about the disease.

They told their eldest child Anna, then ten, because she sensed something was wrong, but their two-year-old twins Arthur and Seth were too young. It was just before Christmas, so they tried to give the children as normal a celebration as possible.

For the first year they confided only in close family. ‘I spent a long time trying to hide it,’ says James. ‘It’s common for people to worry about their employer’s reaction and my big worry was if I’d be booked for concerts and other jobs.’

But as his shaking hand became more obvious, and fearing his colleagues might mistake it for nerves, he decided to tell people. ‘I felt what I said had to be done in a positive, inspiring way. I didn’t want people feeling sorry for me. It’s pity I dread the most. I just want people to be normal around me.’

Reactions were varied.

‘Alfie Boe cracked a few jokes, saying I’d make a good cocktail waiter. I’d rather that than pity.’

James admits he is still in denial –but each new symptom yanks him back to reality. ‘I’ll wake up and my left eye will take longer to open, or my finger might be bent round and I have to bend it back.’

At the moment his problems are mainly stiffness, rigidity and tremors. They are all worsened by cold weather or stress, which makes work difficult at times.

‘I’m coping, and looking at getting a giant iPad so I don’t have to turn pages while conducting. If it gets too difficult, I’ll focus on composing and producing. I struggle with depression, but I think that’s a reaction to my diagnosis.’

There’s no cure, and drug treatments, which aim to boost dopamine, have limited effect. James, now 44, takes Rasagiline, used in the early stages to manage symptoms, and has physiotherapy so he can keep working for as long as possible.

Doctors can’t predict who will get Parkinson’s – unless you’re in a small minority with a genetic predisposition – or how quickly it will progress.

Juliette knows she will one day be James’s carer, but the fact the couple have been together since they were 18 has helped them stay strong.

They organised a summer concert, Symfunny No 1, at the Royal Albert Hall hosted by Al Murray and with performances by Alfie Boe, Jane Horrocks and Rebecca Ferguson, which helped raise more than £125,000 for Parkinson’s UK. They hope to hold another next year.

‘Just as important as the money was increasing understanding, especially for those with Young Onset Parkinson’s,’ says James. ‘This disease can happen to anyone at any age but there is some exciting research that gives hope for the future.’
