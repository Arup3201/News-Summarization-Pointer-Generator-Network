A six-year-old girl was rescued from a well in China after taking a tumble down the 66ft-deep hole in a field of crops.

She was rescued by fire-fighters who pulled together in an amazing rescue effort caught on camera in China's Hebei province. 

The video shows a woman lighting the narrow well with a mobile phone before a fireman is winched down the hole.

He finds the girl cowering in the darkness in a pool of water and secures her to the safety harness before the rest of the team winch him above ground.

The youngster, who is conscious, is laid on the ground as concerned onlookers cover her in a jacket to keep warm until paramedics arrive.
