While United’s other England internationals Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are not expected back at Carrington until next week as they enjoy a three-week break after the tournament in Brazil, Shaw could not wait to get back into the swing of things.

The 18-year-old, who played in the final group game against Costa Rica as Roy Hodgson’s side made an early exit, took part in Thursday morning's training session.

United we stand: Louis van Gaal will not arrive at Manchester United until next week

New manager Louis van Gaal will not arrive at the club until next week but assistant boss Ryan Giggs revealed that the coaching staff have been following the Dutchman’s strict instructions. They are understood to include double sessions on three days during the first week of training with the players ordered to work overtime again on Friday and Sunday.

Giggs, who has been working alongside Van Gaal’s new coaches Albert Stuivenberg and Marcel Bout, said: ‘Everything has been planned through Louis. We’ve had that through and Albert and Marcel know how he works. The blueprint has been prepared by Louis and we’re just following his plans.

‘It’s not ideal because you want all your players and manager there but it can be like this in a World Cup year. The difference is the manager is involved in World Cup this time. Within a week we will be all together. He will get to know the players and they will get to know him.

‘We have spoken a couple of times and exchanged a few emails. It’s been hard because he has either been preparing for games or travelling somewhere but we’ve been in contact.’

Speaking at the announcement of United’s pre-season friendly against Valencia at Old Trafford on August 12, which will be Van Gaal’s first home game in charge, Giggs said that the Dutchman cannot wait for the chance to turn the club’s fortunes around once he fulfils his World Cup commitments in Saturday’s Third Place Playoff.

Holland’s semi-final defeat to Argentina means that Van Gaal is likely to arrive in England a day earlier next week before United embark on their tour of America.

‘He has a clear philosophy and he sticks to that philosophy,’ added Giggs. ‘He won’t be afraid to take over Manchester United, he will relish it.

‘He has been at big clubs like Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and in my mind Manchester United is the biggest. But he’s not scared about the challenge. He is not apprehensive. He can’t wait and he’s got the experience.’
