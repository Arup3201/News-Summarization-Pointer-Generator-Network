A newlywed couple had their wedding day ruined when police interrupted them while they were dancing and told them that their house had been burgled.

It turned out that the culprit was a relative who was not invited to the ceremony and decided to take advantage of the fact that no one would be at the house.

Annwen and Jonathan Bell were shocked to hear that their home had been ransacked - but decided to carry on with the party so as not to spoil it for their 200 guests.

Special day: But the couple were shocked to discover that their home had been broken into

Burglar: Ceri Davis was sentenced to three years and four months in jail over the theft

When they returned to the house in Lampeter, West Wales, they found that their furniture had been slashed and treasured belongings broken, with the damage adding up to £5,000.

The couple had spent two years planning their wedding - which featured five bridesmaids, two flower girls and a six-tier cake - after Mr Bell, 34, proposed outside Buckingham Palace.

Ceri Davies, whose mother is the girlfriend of Mrs Bell's father, has been jailed for three years and four months after admitting burglary and criminal damage.

He was seen breaking into the couple's bungalow by neighbours, who raised the alarm and called police.

Joy: But the wedding was interrupted by the arrival of police officers after the burglary

Davies, 26, denied that the theft was 'spiteful' revenge for a family row when he was sentenced at Swansea Crown Court.

Mrs Bell's father left his wife of 30 years to start a relationship with the defendant's mother Jill Davies, who had been a lodger with the family.

Prosecutor Jackie Lis said: 'The burglary was a particularly nasty offence which saw wanton destruction in the home.

'Davies slashed leather furniture and smashed electrical items and fittings.'

Bride: Mrs Bell said that the incident had marred her big day but she still has happy memories of the wedding

Damage: The couple's belongings were smashed up and their carpet was ruined

Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Bell, 30, said: 'The sofas had been slashed, all our TVs smashed, and sentimental ornaments broken into tiny pieces.

'Jonathan's laptop had been destroyed and a bottle of sherry had been tipped over the carpet.

'I was heartbroken - we had gone from absolute bliss at our wedding to find our home had been wrecked out of spite.'

Destruction: The couple were forced to spend £5,000 to repair the damage to their home

The sales assistant added: 'Everyone had wished us well on our wedding day. But on our first day of our married life together our home had been broken into and £5,000 of damage caused.

'Jonathan had to completely re-decorate our bedroom - I just couldn't sleep in it knowing some stranger had been through all my personal belongings.

'But I am determined that Davies will not spoil the memories of our lovely day.'
