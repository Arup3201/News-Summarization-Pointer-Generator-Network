It may have been a friendly, but Bosnia-Herzegovina's clash with Austria turned ugly on Tuesday night after Edin Dzeko appeared to grab Aleksandar Dragovic by the throat.

Incensed by the reaction following a poor challenge from Muhamed Besic, the Manchester City striker leapt to the defence of his team-mate by screaming at the young Austrian defender.

Standing directly in front of the referee, Dzeko then raised his hands to throttle the reported Premier League target, though he was only booked for his actions.

Tensions boiled over in the friendly in Vienna after Besic's late lunge on Kevin Wimmer. The Everton midfielder was booked, but didn't appear to show any remorse after the tackle.

Several Austrian players charged over, with Dynamo Kyev man Dragovic, who has admitted he is flattered by Manchester United and Arsenal interest, leading the line as a spat soon broke out.

Dzeko captained Bosnia in the 1-1 draw, and it was clear he was taking his role of helping his team-mates to the next level after his actions, for which he could face retrospective action.

Marc Janco opened the scoring for the hosts at the Ernst Happel Stadion, before Izet Hajrovic equalised.
