Our weekly supermarket shop is a gruelling experience.

The stress begins as soon as we arrive and have to decide on seating arrangements - if Minnie and Monty sit side-by-side in the trolley he pulls her hair and she screams, if he sits in the trolly on his own Minnie runs riot in the store practising her skipping and hopping up and down the aisles and generally causing chaos - and always ends with a tantrum by the tills when they see all the tempting treats that their mean mummy says they can't have.

There is literally a wall of sweets - seemingly to ensure that whether children are on foot or sitting up high in trolleys or prams, they can clearly spy the packs of sugary stuff and commence pester power.

As Lidl lead the way by banning sweets and crisps at its check-out, our blogger calls for other supermarkets to follow suit

And because you are stood stationary for a good five minutes, and the tears and the shouting are rather embarrassing, it's actually very hard not to give in.

On Saturday, Monty had a meltdown over a packet of crisps. 'Pom Bears! Pom Bears!' he shouted again and again between ear-splitting shrieks, getting alarmingly red as he sobbed away.

I could tell that the lady manning the till was thinking, 'Just give him a pack of Pom Bears and he'll be quiet love - what's the big deal?'.

The big deal was that I wanted to get him to home so he could eat the healthy pasta, fresh veggies and chicken I was buying for lunch, rather than filling up on junk.

The good news is that the till gauntlet may soon get easier because supermarket chain Lidl is the first to announce that it is removing all sweets, chocolates and crisps from checkouts in its 600 stores across the country in favour of healthier alternatives.

'We know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power, so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways,' said the managing director of Lidl UK

'We're committed not only to raising awareness of the importance of balanced diets and healthy lifestyles, but also making it easier for our customers to follow them,' said managing director Ronny Gottschlich.

'We know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power, so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways.'

So now it might be time to begin some parenting pester power, and get the other big players to follow suit.

Come on Marks & Spencer (one of the worst culprits, with those pigging Percy Pigs), Tesco, Waitrose, Asda and Sainsbury's, help us parents stop the till tantrums by ditching the junk.

Lidl is removing all sweets, 
chocolates and crisps from checkouts in its 600 stores in favour of 
healthier alternatives in a move against obesity.

The
 decision follows evidence that parents’ attempts to encourage children 
to eat healthily are being sabotaged because of the easy available of 
junk food snacks.

Yesterday,
 the National Obesity Forum warned that the obesity epidemic, with all 
the associated ill-health, could be far worse than previously predicted.

Tackling obesity: The decision by the 
supermarket chain follows evidence that parents attempts to encourage 
children to eat healthy are being sabotaged because of the availability 
of snacks

A shock report said 
predictions that half of Britons would be obese by 2050 were an 
‘underestimate’ - because experts did not factor in how much fatter 
we’re getting as we age.

While
 last week, a coalition of doctors and academics called on stores and 
manufacturers to slash sugar levels in processed food and drink by up to
 a third over five years to combat weight gain.

A
 survey by Lidl - the first supermarket to implement a total ban like 
this - found that more than half of parents found it hard to get their 
children to eat healthily when there were snacks everywhere.

The managing director of Lidl UK, Ronny Gottschlich, said the chain is the first to implement a total ban.

‘We’re
 committed not only to raising awareness of the importance of balanced 
diets and healthy lifestyles, but also to making it easier for our 
customers to follow them,’ he said.

‘We
 know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power, so by removing 
sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents 
to reward children in healthier ways.

‘Parents
 are in favour of healthier checkouts and with six in 10 households 
visiting Lidl at least once in the last year and five million customers a
 week coming through our doors, it’s important for us to meet their 
needs and concerns.’

Completely removed: There will be a total ban on
 sweets and chocolate next to the check out following a 10-week trial 
period (file picture)

The decision to ban junk
 food from tills follows a 10-week trial at some stores where ‘treat’ 
items were replaced with more nutritious alternatives, such as nuts and 
fruit, at one checkout in every store.

These
 checkouts received 20per cent higher footfall and research found that 
seven out of 10 customers would pick a sweet-free checkout over a 
traditional one.

Former 
public health minister, Anna Soubry, made efforts to get rid of what she
 called ‘guilt aisles’ while in post. David Cameron has also been 
critical of chains like WHSmith for offering chocolate oranges at 
checkouts.

The Department of
 Health is currently drawing up new voluntary guidelines for the 
marketing of foods high in fat, salt and sugar. Others could follow Lidl
 under this regime – however it is voluntary.

Research
 published by the ‘Junk Free Checkouts’ campaign last year found eight 
in ten parents were unhappy that stores continue to fuel obesity and 
pester power by putting sweets at the tills.

It
 was set up by the Children’s Food Campaign, whose co-ordinator, Malcolm
 Clark, said: ‘We congratulate Lidl for making this move and leading the
 way on removing unhealthy snacks from checkouts.  

‘The onus is now on other supermarkets and retailers to follow suit.’
