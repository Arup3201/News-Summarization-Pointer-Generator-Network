For James Williamson, now 67, life got off to a bad start. The sixth child of a feckless mother, he was handed over to a childless couple in East London 'like a UPS parcel'.

Although his adoptive mother was kind to him, his scaffolder father was abusive and inflicted eye-watering violence on the child, even, on one occasion, attempting to stab him.

But all that paled in comparison with what came next. Aged nine, Mr Williamson fell victim to a predatory paedophile.

Survivor: James Williamson, now 67, suffered years of vile sexual abuse at the hands of his Scoutmaster

In many ways, Mr Williamson's childhood was typical of the East End at the time. 'If you watch Call the Midwife, that sums up what it was like,' he explains.

'We lived in Violet Row which started in Whitechapel and ended in Poplar - that was my environment.  

Handed over: His feckless mother handed him over to his adoptive parents 'like a UPS parcel'

'We had a shared house with outside toilet. Two families lived in it, one upstairs and one downstairs. There was no bath or shower so I was washed down in the kitchen sink.'

The sixth child of a dozen born to a feckless woman called Ellen, he was handed over to a couple named Ivy and Jim for adoption as a baby. 

It was not a loving upbringing. 'My adoptive mother was always working and my father did too,' he remembers. 'I can remember a child minder called Mrs Edmonds and the house always being very quiet.'

Although Ivy was kind, his adoptive father, a man with 'an unpredictable and violent temper', would often terrify him with his rages.

'I didn't love him and I don't think he loved me,' says Mr Williamson. But for all that, he says he did at least put food on the table.

'Whatever he was, whatever he did, he always put food on the table,' he explains. 'I always had clothes. Lots of kids in the East End didn't even have that.'

Nevertheless, his childhood was a lonely one and Mr Williamson says he was 'a latchkey kid' - free to come and go as he pleased.

But while such freedom was not unusual, it proved to have devastating consequences, when, at the age of nine, Mr Williamson fell prey to a child molester.

'I remember I liked war films as a kid,' he says. 'So one day, I decided I wanted to go and see a film called The Battle of the River Plate. 

Difficult: James with his adoptive parents Ivy and Jim. Jim had a 'violent and unpredictable' temper

'I went in and the film was rolling. But the next thing I knew, this guy had come and sat next to me. I was wearing shorts. He had his hand on my knee and it went on from there.'

When he left the cinema, the man followed. Unsuspecting, the trusting little boy allowed himself to be led into a nearby storeroom - and a horrific sex attack ensued.

'I was inquisitive and followed him in there like a little sheep,' he says ruefully. 'I could have been a headstone by now. That's how it could have ended.'

Luckily, Mr Williamson was allowed to go. He ran home and kept what had happened to him secret, never telling anyone what had taken place.

Lonely existence: James as a toddler. He says he spent much of his early years with a child minder

'At the time, I thought: "What was that? I can't tell anyone". I knew it was wrong.' Heartbreakingly, he was also convinced that should his parents find out, they might blame him instead.

'What I was most concerned about was that if I told my parents, they might be angry and maybe put me in a home.

'I thought they might think they'd adopted a duff one. So I just carried on and a year later, I joined the Scouts.'

His decision to join the Scouts was to prove a fateful one and what came next left him with mental scars that have lasted all his life.

'The first thing I thought when I saw him was that he was smart,' says Mr Williamson of the moment he was introduced to his Scoutmaster, a man named Tom.

'He was well-presented. His trousers had real nice creases on the front. He came to the meeting because our Scoutmaster was leaving. 

'In the end, it was announced that Skip [former Scoutmaster] was going and Tom would be taking over. I didn't think he was good looking because he wasn't.'

The meeting, when Mr Williamson was aged 10, signalled the start of what would turn into almost a decade of sexual abuse.

Showered with attention and affection, the lonely little boy was easily groomed and, when Tom offered to take him to the cinema and said he could stay the night afterwards, the relationship became a sexual one.

Unable to tell anyone, in particular his parents, Mr Williamson felt trapped and unable to sound the alarm.

Even today, he is unwilling to condemn his attacker and calls what passed between them 'conditional kindness'.

'My father had a violent and unpredictable temper and Tom's place was a place of tranquillity and safety,' he explains.

'I felt that I was being offered something - a trade. I called it conditional kindness.' Heartbreakingly, he still feels disloyal by talking about what transpired between him and Tom.

'I sort of feel that I'm betraying someone who helped me,' he admits. 'There's a sort of mixed feeling. I also feel disloyal in some way.'

Escape finally came when he left the Scouts aged 18, although he reveals he had tried to escape Tom's attentions many times before.

'I kept trying to get away,' he says. 'But he [Tom] would say things like, "How do you feel about going to Belgium?" and I'd think, "Wow, me an East End boy in Belgium!" And then I'd be right back in it again. I did try.'

Aged 16, he met his first girlfriend and, determined to make it work, he tried again to make a break with his paedophile Scoutmaster.

'I tried so hard to make that break,' he says. 'In the end, I was too old for him. We became sort of friends.'

He went on to marry his girlfriend and together, they had one child. But the marriage broke down when his daughter was a few months old.

Mr Williamson, who has now been with his partner Phil for 30 years, says that the break-down was the result, in part, of him coming to terms with his long-suppressed homosexuality. 

'All I knew was that you had a girlfriend, got married and had a family,' he says. 'Everything else was just with him [Tom] and not quite right.'

But while coming to terms with being gay, which was a criminal offence until 1967, coming to terms with his abusive childhood was even harder.

'I never told anybody. Not once,' he says. 'Not until I wrote the manuscript [for his memoir]. My partner was the first one to read it. 

'He took it calmly. He wasn't disgusted and he took it all in his stride. We've been together for 30 years so It was good to say what had happened.' 

Telling his story: After keeping his experiences secret for more than 30 years, James is finally telling his story in the hope of helping others

And as the litany of historical sex abuse cases relating to Jimmy Saville began to emerge, Mr Williamson grew even more determined to tell his story.

'I used to read all that and think: "That could have been me".' Nevertheless, he says he has no plans to take his own attackers to court and questions the motivation of some of the people who have so far come forward.

'With Yewtree, I wonder why these people have left it so long,' he explains. 'If that was what they wanted, if they were so embittered, why didn't they do it before? 

I think the motivation sometimes is wrong. Now this has gone from not enough has been done to endless court cases and inquiries. The powers that be have gone from one extreme to another.' 

For his own part, Mr Williamson says life, his childhood apart, has treated him well. 'I feel incredibly lucky,' he says.

'You've got to be brave enough to create your own luck. If you sit with your bum on a sofa, nothing will happen. But if you get out and work, you will get that opportunity.

I wanted to be somebody. I didn't want to be somebody working in a factory. Now I am somebody. I've now been retired for 20 years and I've had a great time.'
