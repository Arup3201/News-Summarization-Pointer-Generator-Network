With husband Roger, Lara Griffiths enjoyed a life of luxury following a lottery win that netted the couple a £1.8 million fortune.

Today, after blowing the cash on luxury cars, a converted barn and hundreds of designer handbags, the couple are divorced and Lara has been reduced to selling her beloved bags in order to support her two daughters, Ruby, nine and Kitty, six.

She revealed her plight during her first TV interview on ITV's breakfast show, Daybreak, where presenter Kate Garraway looked on sympathetically as Mrs Griffiths told of her bad luck.

'Do you know, this handbag thing will haunt me until the day I die?' she said. 'I always bought handbags from a child and they're something that I collect and I did buy handbags before winning the money and subsequent to winning the money.'

'You were probably tempted to buy slightly more expensive ones after you had £1 million in the bank though,' commented Garraway.

'Absolutely,' replied Griffith before adding: 'And I'm glad I did because for the last 18 months since Roger left us, the sale of those bags has supported my children.'

Both Lara and her former husband, Roger, quit their jobs in the wake of their lottery win — Roger earned £38,000 as an IT manager and Lara a similar amount as a performing arts teacher — and embarked on the sort of spending spree of which most of us can only dream.

But according to Lara, the couple’s Lottery win wrecked her life after a series of disastrous decisions wiped out their fortune and wrecked their marriage, for which she places the blame squarely on Roger's shoulders.

‘He’d f****d up everything,’ she said in an interview with MailOnline.

Her husband, meanwhile, denies the accusations, who today claims to have just £7 in the bank and lives alone in a small, chilly, stone cottage in Harrogate.

‘Both of us wanted to try to turn our win into more,’ he says. ‘I thought I was doing the right thing. I was the one who won that money, so I took responsibility.’

‘It didn’t cross my mind that I’d end up here — the one thing I didn’t want to do was waste that money.'

Griffith, who admitted that she still plays the lottery, was asked about her former five star lifestyle by entertainment editor, Richard Arnold but described claims that she once enjoyed luxury Dubai holidays, top notch London weekends and drove a Lexus as 'nonsense, absolute nonsense.'

'I don't know when that was,' she retorted. 'I wasn't there. We didn't live a rock n'roll lifestyle... at all.

'We ploughed our money into putting something into the community. You know, we really wanted to do something right.'
