Britney Spears arrived at the X Factor auditions in Kansas City today looking perfectly demure in a white floral frock.

But the singer lost her composure just moments after stepping out from her black SUV, stumbling in her platform peep toe heels.

The 30-year-old panicked as she struggled to maintain her balance, but thankfully narrowly avoided falling over.

The mogul arranged for Louis Walsh, who works on the UK X Factor, to fly the US to cover him.

Simon convinced bosses at the Fox 
network that Louis was the best person for the job due to his vast 
experience on the British show and immediately arranged a £160,000 
round-trip by private jet to cover for him at auditions today and 
tomorrow.

Simon hopes to have recovered  in time for the next auditions in San Francisco on June 16.

Disorder, but is unable to take medication for it because it interferes 
with other tablets she takes for her mental health issues.

fiancé, her former agent Jason Trawick.
