Mark Duggan: An unlikely martyr, given his suspected gang links

Semone Wilson has not yet told her children that their father is dead. ‘How do I explain to them that their daddy is gone?’ she says.

Such a task would be traumatic enough for any mother, but especially so for Miss Wilson.

Her fiance, Mark Duggan, was travelling in a minicab in North London on Thursday evening when it was stopped by officers from Scotland Yard’s Operation Trident, who specialise in fighting black-on-black gun crime.

The officers were armed with Heckler & Koch submachine guns and there was an apparent ‘exchange’ of fire. Moments later Duggan was dead.

He and Miss Wilson, both 29, had been together since they were 17. They had two sons aged ten and seven, and a baby daughter.

‘Mark was a good dad,’ says Miss Wilson, a student at Middlesex University. ‘He loved his kids dearly. He idolised them.’

Maybe he was. Perhaps he did.

His family and friends claim he was unarmed and have demanded ‘Justice for Mark’.

But the man whose violent death triggered the Tottenham riots at the weekend makes an unlikely martyr.

On the streets of the Broadwater Farm estate, where Mark Duggan grew up, he was also known by another name: ‘Starrish Mark’.

It sounds like an innocent nickname; it was anything but. In fact, the word ‘Starrish’ denoted his membership of a notorious ‘crew’ called The Star Gang who strut the streets of London’s N17.

The stock-in-trade of such ‘postcode’ gangs is violence, intimidation and, more often than not, drugs.

Duggan himself, according to some residents, was a crack cocaine dealer who routinely carried a gun.

It was an argument over a woman and drugs, they say, that resulted in the death of his cousin Kelvin Easton, 23, who was stabbed through the heart with a broken champagne bottle at the Boheme nightclub in Bow, east London, in March this year.

‘Duggan was paranoid about what happened to his cousin,’ said one local. ‘He had a gun to protect himself because of what happened to Kelvin.’

So much for Mark Duggan being a ‘well respected member of his community’, as he is described on a memorial website.

That respect was underpinned by fear.

Inferno: Duggan's death sparked riots throughout Tottenham which proved incredibly destructive

Police: Officers had numerous show-downs with protestors angry at Duggan's death

Violence: These youths are shown using aerosol cans to set fire to shops' shelves

The Star Gang is an offshoot of Tottenham’s ‘Man dem’ gang which has links with Jamaica’s ruthless Yardie gangsters.

Back in the late Nineties, ‘Man dem’, whose ‘territory’ included Broadwater Farm (where Duggan grew up, remember), controlled dozens of ‘crack houses’ and its psychopathic members or ‘soldiers’, as they styled themselves, were believed to be behind countless shootings, robberies, kidnappings and gangland killings.

The leader was one Mark Lambie, who police suspected was implicated in the murder of PC Keith Blakelock, hacked to death by a mob during the infamous riot on Broadwater Farm in 1985. Lambie was just 14 at the time.

He was eventually jailed for 12 years in 2002 for other gang-related crimes (which involved torturing two rivals with a hammer and an electric iron, and pouring boiling water over their genitals).

The Star Gang is understood to have been formed after Lambie was locked up.

Can there be any doubt that Mark Duggan, the loving father and ‘respected’ member of the community, was involved in this chilling sub-culture? Not really.

Aftermath: Shops were destroyed and pavements strewn with rubbish on the morning after the riots

Emergency: Firemen were working all day to bring burning buildings under control

One photo circulating the internet shows Duggan making a ‘gangsta’ gun pose with his  fingers. In others, he is wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ‘Star Gang’.

How grimly predictable that  there is a 
link, through gang membership, between Mark Duggan – focus of the 
Tottenham riots of 2011 –  and the murder of PC Blakelock during similar
 riots 26 years ago.

The eruption of violence in Tottenham is a chilling echo of the infamous Broadwater Farm riots 26 years ago in which PC Keith Blakelock was hacked to death.

The disorder on October 6, 1985, was sparked by the death of 49-year-old Cynthia Jarrett after four police officers burst into her home.

Mrs Jarrett’s son Floyd was in custody at Tottenham police station after allegedly giving officers a false name over a car tax disc.

The ensuing police raid sparked panic in his household on the Broadwater Farm estate and Mrs Jarrett, who had a weak heart, collapsed and died.

The next day a small crowd gathered in protest outside the police station –  much like the demonstration over the shooting of Mark Duggan by police.

Tensions spilled over into violence when the police station windows were broken and at 3.15pm, two officers were attacked and seriously injured as the gathering mob began to launch bricks and gunfire broke out.

By the time riot police arrived to support firemen after a blaze broke out at a newsagent's, the mob had put up barriers and prepared petrol bombs.

As police were forced back, PC Blakelock, 40, tripped and fell.

He was surrounded and hacked to death by masked rioters wearing balaclavas and wielding sticks, knives and a machete.

Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted of the Blakelock killing in 1987 but cleared on appeal.

Outside the North London semi where Duggan’s parents Vincent and Pamela and younger brother Marlon, 27, live, there is further proof of the world Mark Duggan inhabited.

One of the messages left among the floral tributes refers to ‘Gang N17 Farm’ (a rival postcode gang).

Indeed, Operation Trident officers had Duggan under surveillance amid fears he was planning to avenge the death of his cousin Kelvin Easton. He was about to be arrested when he was fatally injured.

Moments earlier, he had phoned his fiancee Semone Wilson.

‘I spoke to him at about 5pm [on Thursday] and he asked me if I would cook dinner and I said “Yes”, she told the Mail.

‘At about 6pm he sent out a  message on his BlackBerry saying “the Feds are following me”, and that’s it, the last time anyone heard from him.

‘By 6.15, he had been gunned down.

‘I kept phoning and phoning to find out where he was. He wasn’t answering. I didn’t know what had happened.’

Later, she received a phone call from his brother.

‘Marlon phoned me and told me what had happened,’ she said. ‘I didn’t believe it. I kept phoning Mark, then everyone was phoning me. Then I thought it must be true because I still hadn’t heard from him.’

Miss Wilson says she and Duggan, who also had a fourth child from another relationship, were planning to get married. She said she did not recognise the picture of Mark as a ‘gangster’.

‘Mark was known to police but he had never been sent down for anything before. He has been on remand. I can’t remember what for, but it was about nine years ago.

‘I believe that if he had a firearm [on the evening he died] and if he saw police he would run rather  than shoot. When he was remanded last time, he said he hated jail and never wanted to go back there. I can’t see why he would have a gun on him at all.’
