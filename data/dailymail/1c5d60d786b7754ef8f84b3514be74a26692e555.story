Nothing beats a boiled egg with soldiers for breakfast. But the morning rush means most bleary-eyed commuters don’t have time to prepare them.

But now a high-tech saucepan, designed by Oxford University rocket scientist Dr Tom Povey, claims to cut the time it takes to boil an egg.

Futuristic ridged ‘fins’ on the sides direct heat and are claimed to cut a minute off an egg’s boiling time — which could mean the difference between missing or catching a train. 

How do you like your eggs in the morning? A high-tech saucepan, designed by rocket scientist Dr Tom Povey, claims to cut the time it takes to boil an egg

It is also said to distribute heat more evenly, ensuring your egg is perfectly cooked throughout.

But is it the fastest?

Amanda Cable put Dr Povey’s Flare to the test, along with other pans, using her Aga hotplate.

For the test, she placed two medium-sized eggs at room temperature into a pan of cold water, timing one for three minutes and another for five, once each pan began to boil.

FLARE SAUCEPAN, £64.99,  lakeland.co.uk

Its space-age design means that high-performance fins channel heat across the bottom and up the sides of the pan, cooking food faster.

BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Nine minutes 30 seconds — surprisingly slow, but it is designed mainly for use on gas hobs.

EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Hang on, this solid egg can’t have been cooking for only three minutes. It’s already hard-boiled.

EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: Nicely done for those who prefer a firm egg.

VERDICT: If you want your eggs cooked with the speed of a space rocket, look no further.

SCORE: 10/10

CERAMICA, £92.99, lakeland.co.uk

A set of four saucepans in Farrow & Ball-type shades made from cast aluminium that conducts heat efficiently, avoiding hot spots. Each has a clip-on handle, which means they stack inside each other neatly.

BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Five minutes 12 seconds.

EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Watery and uneven, with the whites around the yolk still translucent. Perfect for my husband — but not for me.

EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: This still had some setting to do — and the yolk gave way like a thick Creme Egg when I put my teaspoon in. Uneven.

VERDICT: More style than substance as  the eggs weren’t  cooked well.

SCORE: 6/10

ROCCO, £20, simply-shops.net

A replica of the saucepans your mum used in the Seventies — with wooden handle, cream enamel and twee country print (above right).

BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Nine minutes 41 seconds.

EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Evenly cooked with a nice consistency

EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: If your favourite childhood memory was dipping toast into a firm boiled egg, this gives perfect results.

VERDICT: Good.

SCORE: 7/10

SIMPLY PERFECT BY RAYMOND BLANC, £52.50, johnlewis.com

This heavy anodised saucepan  is non-stick and dishwasher safe, with a long, curved handle.

BOILING TIME FROM COLD: 16 minutes.

EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Both yolk and white were almost solid.

EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: Yolk was solid and quite pale — all in all, a little like the rubber balls I throw for the dog.  

VERDICT: You’ll need to set your alarm early if you like eggs in the morning and use this pan. Probably better reserved for making a French stew.

SCORE: 5/10

SAINBURY’S CLASSIC, £11,  sainsburys.co.uk

No-frills non-stick pan with a plastic handle and glass lid.

BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Four minutes 54 seconds.

EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Cooked unevenly, with some of the white still watery. Yolk was set in places and runny in others.

EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: White was tough and rubbery. Yolk was hard, but moist and not chalky.

VERDICT: This boiled faster than any other pan, but as the heat was concentrated at the bottom, parts of the egg cooked more rapidly than others. The plastic handle also became warm. For a student on a budget, though, this is a good option.

SCORE: 3/10

JAMIE OLIVER PROFESSIONAL SERIES BY TEFAL, £52,  johnlewis.com

Swish stainless steel with a measuring gauge. It has two lips for easy pouring and a long handle to avoid splashes. An aluminium base distributes heat evenly.

BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Five minutes.

EGG AT THREE MINUTES: A gleaming, soft yolk so inviting you want to dunk the nearest piece of bread straight inside. The soft white was nicely set.

EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: Evenly cooked, but not dry and chalky.

VERDICT: Fast boiling and cooks evenly. I’m impressed.

SCORE: 9/10

MAUVIEL M'HERITAGE  copper saucepan, £200, divertimenti.co.uk

At £200, this 18cm pan (below left) is a pricey option due to the fact that it’s made from copper, which conducts heat better than any other metal.

BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Seven minutes 22 seconds.

EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Yolk had set in the middle, but was soft around the edges. White did not cook evenly — it remained runny around the yolk.

EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: With the additional cooking time, the yolk had set hard, with the white nicely firm.

VERDICT: The eggs weren’t evenly cooked — though my husband, who enjoys a runny consistency, said this was his favourite.

SCORE: 6/10

INGENIO, £85 FOR THREE, TEFAL

Stacking saucepan with a clip-on handle. Made from aluminium, the inside is coated with Intensium non-stick, which Tefal claims lasts twice as long as other coatings.

BOILING TIME FROM COLD: Five minutes 38 seconds.

EGG AT THREE MINUTES: Cooked very quickly and evenly, with some yolk oozing over the sides as I pushed my spoon in.

EGG AT FIVE MINUTES: The white was pleasantly firm and the yolk perfectly cooked.

VERDICT: A good all-rounder.

SCORE: 7/10
