Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Leicester won their first Premier League home game against Arsenal (2-1 in November 1994) but none of the subsequent seven games saw them claim three points.

The last time Arsenal played Leicester was the 38th and final game of the unbeaten 2003-04 Premier League campaign.

Leicester’s players to have featured so far have a combined total of 550 Premier League appearances, fewer than any other team this season.

Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez has conceded more fouls (7) without getting booked than any other Premier League player this season.

Invincibles: Arsenal's Patrick Vieira scores past Leicester keeper Ian Walker to seal a 2-1 win in the sides' last meeting back in May 2004, which resulted in the Gunners going the 2003-04 campaign unbeaten

Arsenal have only won three of their last nine Premier League away games (D2 L4).

Injured hitman Olivier Giroud has been involved in 25 goals since the start of last season, level with Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero.
