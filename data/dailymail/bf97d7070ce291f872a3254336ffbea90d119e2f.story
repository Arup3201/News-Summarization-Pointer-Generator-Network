'He said, "Yeah, you’re young, you have good quality, but work. You have to work. Every day you have to work if you want to be one of the best". I remember that very well.'

Hazard, who has scored 13 goals this season, also heaped praise on former Lille boss Claude Puel.

He added: 'When I turned professional Claude Puel was my first manager. He’s at Nice now. He was very good.'

Belgium international Hazard will be hoping to add to his trophy cabinet on Sunday as Chelsea go head-to-head with Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final.
