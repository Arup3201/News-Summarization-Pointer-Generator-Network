Nokia has launched its latest high-end smartphone with a new metal design and its most advanced camera yet.

The Lumia 925 features a lighter and thinner body than its predecessors and an enhanced screen which can be read in bright sunlight.

The Finnish firm unveiled the device at a much-hyped London launch event where it described the handset as its best smartphone ever.

Android will take the
largest share of the UK smartphone market with 15 million users in 2013 which
accounts for 48.6% of total smartphone users.

iOS will take the second largest
portion with 8.7 million users or 28%.

eMarketer estimates that BlackBerry will
have 4.3 million users and will see its market share fall to 14% down from
15.5% the previous year.

Finally, Windows Mobile will have an estimated 1.2
million users or 3.8%, down from 4% last year.

The 925 will sell for around 469 euros (about Â£400) before tax and and will be available as early as next month.

It comes as eMarketer estimates that there will be 30.9 million
smartphone users in the UK this year which represents 48.4% of the total
population.

By 2014 , every other person in the UK will be a smartphone user as
this figure increases to 53.4%.

Jo Harlow, executive vice president of Nokia's smart devices, stressed the company's push to 'keep innovating' as she revealed the latest developments in the Lumia series.

'We're advancing experiences on the Nokia Lumia portfolio, whether that means great new benefits for an existing Lumia owner or bringing new showcase devices like the Nokia Lumia 925,' she said.

Among the 925's central features are its 'smart camera' which is designed to capture 10 images at once to create the 'perfect' high quality image.

The function is to be extended to all Lumia Windows Phone 8 smartphones.

Introducing the 'beautifully refined, beautifully crafted' Lumia 925, Ms Harlow said.

'The most innovative smartphone in the world did just get better.'

However, experts were less impressed.

'The launch of the Lumia 925 is a bit of a missed opportunity for Nokia,' said Jason Jenkins, Editor of CNET UK.

'Having pulled out all the stops to 
hype the launch to the heavens in the tech press, I was hoping for 
something more innovative.

'That
said, it's a perfectly decent mobile for people that want something 
easier to use than an Android mobile such as the Galaxy S4, plus a 
bigger screen than the one on the iPhone.

'But it's not going to do anything to upset the Apple/ Samsung duopoly.'
