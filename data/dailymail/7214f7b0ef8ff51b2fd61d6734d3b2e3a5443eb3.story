A photo of a woman in the United States Air Force tongue-kissing the Prisoners of War Missing in Action symbol has outraged members of the military, the blogoshpere and the general public.

The photo was taken roughly three years ago at an unidentified location, but it just recently has gone viral on the Internet and has prompted an investigation into the woman in the picture, Staff Sergeant Cherish Byers, a member of the 92nd Security Forces Squadron based in Spokane, Washington.

Following the command-directed investigation, the military will determine what - if any - disciplinary measures will be taken.

'It's a concern any time someone shows disrespect for prisoners of war 
and those missing in action,' Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force James Cody said in the statement to Air Force Times. 'They deserve 
our utmost respect, and we must always remember their sacrifice and the 
legacy they've left for us as men and women serving our nation.

'I
 want to make it clear that this is not a reflection of airmen who wear 
this uniform; it is a case of poor judgment of one airman ... to say we 
are disappointed would be an understatement. We are gathering all the 
details and will take appropriate action at the appropriate level. Our 
airmen fully understand the significance of the POW/MIA flag and the 
sacrifice of the men and women it honors,' Cody continued.

The photo has been posted on several military social media websites, where people have expressed their outrage over the offensive photo.

Outrage: Byers faces potential disciplinary action once an investigation into her offensive photo is complete

'Let me put this out there seeing as I'm an Air Force veteran ... no matter what uniform she was wearing this is disrespectful anyways,' Tara Marie Murray wrote on the Military Mind's Photos Facebook page.

In an interview with the publication, Marine Corps veteran Michael Kelly said he felt 'blind fury and disgust' when he saw the image.

'There's absolutely no reason to have done anything like that,' Kelley 
said. 'It goes completely against everything that we're taught in the 
military from Day 1. She failed herself; she's failed the Air Force and 
the military community as a whole by doing something that disrespectful 
and then having it get out to the world like that.'

Byers could not be reached for comment, and she appears to have deleted her pages on social media.
