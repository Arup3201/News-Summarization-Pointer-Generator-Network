A collection of touching letters addressed to best-selling crime novelist Agatha Christie have been published for the first time.

The heartfelt notes, many of which date back to the 1950s and 1960s, praise the crime writer for her epic novels and short stories and thank her for helping individuals through hard times.

The horde of messages, which have been published to mark the 125th anniversary of her birthday, include a letter from author PG Wodehouse, as well as a note from a Polish woman in London, who told how one of Christie's novels helped her survive a war-time labour camp in Germany.

The woman explained in her letter how she exchanged a piece of candle for a Polish translation of Christie's novel, The Man in the Brown Suit.

In her fan mail, she wrote: 'I read and re-read (it) so often that I almost knew it by heart.

'The first few pages were missing so I didn't know the title or the author but for seven months it was my only link with a normal world.

'I know your writings have given pleasure and amusement to millions of people all over the world but never can one of your books have meant more to anyone than that tattered Polish translation did to me.'

Christie, who wrote 66 detective novels and 14 short-story collections, also treasured a 1958 letter from a 14-year-old boy in Bristol who started a book club at his school so he could raise funds to buy her work.

'I have bought 28 books by you and this is how I have managed it,' he wrote.

'I charge the boys 3d per book to read at school, and 6d if they wished to take them home.

'With the money I obtained . . . I bought more 'AC' books . . . Now my scheme is bringing in so much money, I can afford to buy one of your books a week.' 

One letter, dated August 1963, thanks Ms Christie for helping women prisoners escape in Romania (above) by writing her novels. The note references Christie's crime novels including Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple

In the five-page handwritten letter, he later told how he would be 'truly proud' to hold a response from Christie and said he would be able to show it to his children in years to come. 

He also asked the 'Queen of Crime' at what age she began writing and expressed an interest in knowing the background of her successful career.

In her typed response, which Christie also kept a copy of, she replied: 'I was very interested in your letter. You seem to have had a very good idea and I congratulate you.'

Christie, who died in 1976 aged 85, also saved a note from PG Wodehouse, the English writer best known for the Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels and short stories.

His 1969 letter from New York stated that he was 'pleased and proud' after discovering she had dedicated a Halloween party to him and added 'a new Agatha Christie is always an event'.

Praising her choice of title, Wodehouse also revealed that he found 'getting a satisfactory title is the most difficult problem'.

Also in the collection is a letter written in 1963 by a woman who spent more than a decade in a Romanian prison with no access to books.

She told the best-selling author: 'During the 12 years I spent in prison I never saw a written page.

'My memory, however, could not be sealed up and thanks to it and to you my fellow-sufferers came to know and to love the works of Agatha Christie.'

Christie's grandson Mathew Prichard published a number of the letters and replies to mark her 125th anniversary and encouraged today's fans to share their experience of her writing.

He said: 'Knowing what receiving these letters meant to my grandmother, I'm sure she would be moved to see these personal stories shared publicly for the first time.

'As we call to her fans across the globe to share their stories and experiences of Christie, I look forward to discovering how her work continues to inspire today.' 

Christie, who also wrote under the name Mary Westmacott, died aged 85 having written more than 66 detective novels, most famously featuring her creations Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple.
