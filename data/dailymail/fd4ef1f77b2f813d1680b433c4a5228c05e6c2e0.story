The family home of the millionaire businessman cleared of plotting to murder his wife on their honeymoon has been vandalised and a Monopoly-style 'get out of jail free' card left outside.

Detectives have launched an investigation after white paint was thrown over the driveway and gate of Shrien Dewani's home.

The vandalism comes just a day after the 34-year-old jetted back into the UK after being cleared of  murdering his wife Anni in South African four years ago.

Mr Dewani left Gatwick Airport through a side entrance yesterday before being driven away behind  in black people carrier.

He was not believed that he returned to his home is on a busy road connecting Bristol to the M5 and is accessed through electronic gates.

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said the force had not been contacted by Mr Dewani or any members of his family.

'Officers are looking into this after being made aware by the media,' he said. 

Dewani walked free on Monday after being  cleared of any part in the killing despite the judge ruling that many 'unanswered questions' still surrounded the case.

The ruling prompted an angry response from Anni's family, who are now considering whether to launch a civil action against her husband in the UK

The ruling in South Africa, prompted an angry response from Anni's family, who are considering whether to launch a civil action against her husband in the UK.

They said the decision left many questions unanswered as it meant Dewani, who led a double life, would not have to give evidence or face cross-examination.

The family waited four years for the case to be brought against the businessman, who had been accused of staging the car-jacking in which she was gunned down.

Speaking on the steps of Western Cape High Court after Dewani was acquitted, Anni's sister Ami Denborg said the family felt 'failed' by the justice system. 

Ms Denborg said the family would be 'haunted' by the decision.

Holding back tears, she said: 'We came here looking for answers and we came here looking for the truth and all we got was more questions.

'We waited patiently for four years to hear what really happened to Anni and to hear the full story of what happened to our dearest little sister.

'All we wanted was to hear all the events and the hope of actually finding that out has kept us, as a family, going. Unfortunately we believe that this right has now been taken away from us.'

Drawing on evidence that Dewani had secret relationships with gay men in the months before they married, Ms Denborg said: 'We heard that Shrien has led a double life and that Anni knew nothing about it.  And we just wish that Shrien had been honest with us and especially with Anni.'

Dewani heaved a sigh of relief as the judge dismissed the case against him. 

He left court a short time later through a side entrance, declining to comment.

Three men - Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and gunman Xolile Mngeni - have already been convicted for their parts in Anni's murder, which happened when the Dewanis' chauffeur-driven late-night tour of a township was hijacked.

Monde Mbolombo, a self-confessed 'middle man' who set up the murder, may now also face justice, having previously been granted immunity by the state.

Prosecutors said Dewani had long planned to get out of the relationship to Swedish-raised engineer Anni, 28, and arranged a car-jacking on their honeymoon in Cape Town in November 2010 in which he would escape unharmed and Anni would be killed.

But Judge Traverso said the claims of the chief prosecution witness, cab driver Tongo, were 'riddled with contradictions' and 'highly debatable'.

Dewani, who was  extradited this year to face trial, listened intently as key evidence against him was criticised by the judge.

The ruling ended a four-year wait for Dewani and his family to clear his name - a period which included lengthy spells in mental health units, lurid allegations about his private life and fighting extradition from the UK.
