A teenage swimmer has told how he suffered an eye infection which spread to his brain.

Perry Gardner, 16, suffered a number of migraines in July last year before being diagnosed with an eye infection.

It is not clear now how he got the infection. Perry said: ‘I was admitted into 
hospital and with the infection becoming embedded in my brain, suddenly I
had brain surgeons talking about having to operate to save my life.

Perry Gardner, 16, was diagnosed with an eye infection after he started suffering migraines. He was admitted to hospital when the infection spread to his brain. Surgeons considered carrying out brain surgery to tackle Perry's infection but decided, as it was very risky, to try draining the infection first. This proved to be effective

‘Suddenly my life was in danger, but you’ve just got to fight haven’t you? All I wanted to do was to get back into the pool, and normality.’

But a decision by the medical team at Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital trying to decide the best way forward proved vital.

Perry said: ‘Luckily, one of the professors decided it was too risky for such a complicated procedure with me being so young, so instead opted to drain the infection and hope for the best - fortunately it worked.’

Perry (pictured in hospital) said: 'It came as a real shock when you think it just started out as an eye infection. I was admitted into hospital and with the infection becoming embedded in my brain, suddenly I had brain surgeons talking about having to operate to save my life'

Perry’s mother Michelle added: ‘At first he was only let out of hospital for six hours at a time.

‘Most people would just want to go straight home. But Perry? No. He wanted to go straight down to the swimming club, his other family, and see his mates and coaches there.

‘He’s so tough mentally - we were still recovering from being told our boy could die, while he just shrugged it off.

‘That’s one reason why I really believe he’s in such a good position to realise his dream.’

Perry, who hopes to win a place in Team GB, was not allowed to return to the pool until six months after he developed the eye infection but was delighted to get a personal best in his first competition after recovering

Perry said: 'In a strange way the illness has given me even more motivation to get to where I want to be - racing for GB - and that starts with the European Junior Championships next year'

While Perry was in the early stages of his battle to return to full health his doctors refused to give him the all-clear to return to the pool.

But he threw himself into regaining fitness at the Neptune Centre pool’s small gym for two hours every day.

Lisa Bates, Perry’s coach, said: ‘You can’t praise the lad enough.

Perry's mother, Michelle (pictured with Perry and his father, Andrew), said: 'He's so tough mentally - we were still recovering from being told our boy could die, while he just shrugged it off'

‘To go through an ordeal like he did would have destroyed a lot of young athletes but as soon as he was able to, he forced himself into a small gym to train when he couldn’t in the pool.’

The hard work and determination paid off in January this year when doctors finally gave him the go-ahead to return to the pool, and full training.

Since then Perry hasn’t looked back and despite everything that had happened he returned to competition in July and now has set his sights firmly on making the Great British Junior squad next year.

Perry says that after his illness he feels like he has been given a second chance and that it has increased his motivation to become a member of the GB swimming team

Perry said: ‘Obviously setting personal bests in my first meet back was pleasing, but it’s just the start as far as I’m concerned.

‘In a strange way the illness has given me even more motivation to get to where I want to be - racing for GB - and that starts with the European Junior Championships next year.’

Perry added: ‘It feels like I’ve been given a second chance, and I’m going to take it.’
