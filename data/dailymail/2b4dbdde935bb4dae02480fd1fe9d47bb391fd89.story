Sven-Goran Eriksson has taken a swipe at Roy Hodgson's England squad by claiming his 2006 team were better prepared to win the World Cup than the 2014 edition are now.

England open their campaign against Italy tonight hoping for a strong start in a difficult Group D, which also contains Uruguay.

But Eriksson believes Hodgson's men will have had a successful tournament in Brazil if they reach the last-eight.

Winners? Sven-Goran Eriksson (right) believes his 2006 England squad was better than Roy Hodgson's

Challenge: Eriksson says that Hodgson's (centre) men will do well to get to the quarters in Brazil

Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: 'I don’t think any team were better than England at the World Cup in Germany (where he led them to the quarter-finals).

'I don’t believe England have the chance to win this time.

'The quarter-finals would be a good achievement.'

Following a 0-0 draw with Portugal, England were eliminated 3-1 on penalties eight years ago, with Ballon D'or winner Cristiano Ronaldo scoring the winning spot-kick.

And the 66-year-old Swede, who also led England to the last eight of Euro 2004 and the 2002 World Cup during his five years at the helm, cannot see Hodgson's men getting past that stage either.

Eirksson managed a side containing England's so-called 'golden generation', with David Beckham as his captain and Michael Owen up front.

But that squad also included Jermaine Jenas, Scott Carson, Stewart Downing and, infamously, Theo Walcott who was called up despite not having made a first team appearance for Arsenal and he was an unused substitute in Germany, even when Owen broke down.

GOALKEEPERS: Paul Robinson (Tottenham), David James (Manchester City), Scott Carson (Liverpool)

DEFENDERS: Gary Neville (Manchester United), Ashley Cole (Arsenal), Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United), John Terry (Chelsea), Sol Campbell (Arsenal), Wayne Bridge (Chelsea), Jamie Carragher (Liverpool)

MIDFIELDERS: Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), David Beckham (captain, Real Madrid), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Joe Cole (Chelsea), Owen Hargreaves (Bayern Munich), Jermaine Jenas (Tottenham), Michael Carrick (Tottenham), Aaron Lennon (Tottenham), Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough)

FORWARDS: Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Michael Owen (Newcastle United), Peter Crouch (Liverpool), Theo Walcott (Arsenal)

GOALKEEPERS: Joe Hart (Manchester City), Ben Foster (West Bromwich Albion), Fraser Forster (Celtic)

DEFENDERS: Glen Johnson (Liverpool), Leighton Baines (Everton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Luke Shaw (Southampton)

MIDFIELDERS: Steven Gerrard (captain, Liverpool), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal), Frank Lampard (unattached, formerly of Chelsea), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), James Milner (Manchester City), Raheem Sterling (Liverpool), Adam Lallana (Southampton), Ross Barkley (Everton)

FORWARDS: Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Danny Welbeck (Manchester United), Rickie Lambert (Liverpool)

Golden generation? Eriksson's England team which lined up against Portugal in the 2006 quarter-final

No hopers? Hodgson (front, fourth from right) with his 2014 England World Cup squad

But now only captain Steven Gerrard, midfield veteran Frank Lampard and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney remain as Hodgson attempts to remodel his squad around youth.

The Swede is convinced that his side, unlike Hodgson's, had a genuine chance of winning the World Cup.

Eriksson said: 'We lost on penalties again but I don’t think Portugal - or any team - were better than us at that time. The margins are very small.

'This time England has changed a lot, with new players.

'I think they will go through the group stage and then it depends on who they meet.'

Unlucky: Eriksson says that no side in the world were better than his England team in 2006

Heartbreak: Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty knocked England out of the World Cup in Germany 2006

Eriksson insists his side could have won the World Cup in 2006

@highlight

He says that no side were better than his, including Portugal

The Swede does not think current crop of England players can win though

@highlight

He believes it is a transition period and they do not have the experience
