Kaiserslautern striker Philipp Hofmann produced most of the most spectacular misses of recent times against fellow Bundesliga 2 side Union Berlin on Wednesday night.

The 21-year-old had the goal at his mercy from just two yards out but somehow contrived to lift the ball agonisingly over the bar.

Luckily for Hofmann his side were still able to secure maximum points from the encounter with a 1-0 win, otherwise he could have well been in hot water with his manager Kosta Runjaic.

Ironically the man who crossed the ball over to Hofmann - Alexander Ring -  popped up with the winner later in the game.

Hofmann will now join the ever-growing list of the likes of Kanu, Jon Dahl Tomasson, Ronny Rosenthal et al in some of the spectacular misses seen in the game.
