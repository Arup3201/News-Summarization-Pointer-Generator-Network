A popular barman with British parents and sisters who has worked in the UK for 12 years has been forced to return to his native Philippines because his visa ran out.

Fredel Buenavista, 32, left the country in south east Asia at the age of four and arrived in Britain when he was 20 with his stepfather Alan Pratt and his mother Maria, who are both British citizens.

But earlier this month Mr Buenavista, from Maidstone, Kent, was detained by the Home Office earlier this month and threatened with deportation.

Popular: Barman Fredel Buenavista, 32, has British parents and sisters, and has worked in the UK for 12 years but had to return to his native Philippines because his visa ran out, despite a campaign from his customers

Upheaval: Mr Buenavista, with his mother Maria, sisters Sophia and Sarah and stepfather Alan, went to school and university in Britain, having arrived on a student visa, but the Home Office say he never had a work permit

Around 3,000 people signed a petition calling for immigration officials to change their minds, and his MP promised to take the fight 'to the highest level'.

His deportation was then delayed on compassionate grounds earlier this month as Mr Pratt underwent major stomach surgery.

However, on Monday evening Mr Buenavista- known as Fred - gave up his fight and voluntarily flew himself back to the Philippines.

By leaving of his own accord he is eligible to apply for a new visa after 12 months, as opposed to 10 years if he had been deported.

Support: Regulars at the Royal Albion in Maidstone, where Mr Buenavista works raised more than £1,000 for his new life alone

Fond farewell: Mr Buenavista's manager at the Royal Albion pub, Karan Le Quelenec, said the barman had 'done everything by the book', but was 'being made an example of'

Friend: Mr Buenavista's friend Dustin Burton set up a Facebook page to help support his claim to stay in the UK

Regulars at the Royal Albion in Maidstone, where Mr Buenavista works raised more than £1,000 for his new life alone.

Speaking before he left Britain, Mr Buenavista said: 'It’s not right, it’s not fair. They are getting rid of someone who is working and supporting the community.

'It’s starting from scratch. I feel lonely and depressed, I have never lived alone before. I’m trying not to see people to make it easy on myself to leave.'

He added: 'I must have done something right in life and been raised well for this many people to care.'

Mr Buenavista, who has two younger British sisters, returned to the Philippines with his mother who will stay with him for four weeks before flying back to Britain.

Hopeful: By leaving of his own accord Mr Buenavista is eligible to apply for a new visa after 12 months, as opposed to 10 years if he had been deported

'It is the first time in 32 years the family will be apart,' she said. 

'Not together for Christmas or New Year or birthdays.'

Mr Pratt, 68, said: 'He is going to have to steer a different path now. Especially to his mother and sisters, he’s their life.

'When I’m not here he’s the one they all turn to. It just doesn’t seem right being able to break a family apart like this.'

After leaving the Philippines as a young boy, Mr Buenavista lived in New Zealand with his family before arriving in the UK and went to school in Dartford and university in Surrey before starting work.

He came here on a student visa and later applied for a work permit, which the Home Office said was never granted.

He was thrown into an immigration detention centre after he failed to appeal the decision to remove him from the UK.

But campaigners say this was only because of inaccurate legal advice.

His manager at the pub Karan Le Quelenec said: 'He’s done everything by the book and he’s been made an example of.

'Had he not signed in and done everything properly he’d still be here.

'He’s been made a scapegoat for their facts and figures at the end of the year. It’s just not justice.'

She told how Mr Buenavista went to a local police station to sign in as requested by the Home Office every two weeks, not knowing he was about to be detained.

His step-father waited outside in his car for two hours but he never came out.

The next time the family heard from him was when he called Mr Pratt from the detention centre in Dover.

Before his departure Tracey Crouch, Tory MP for Chatham and Aylesford, said: 'I have taken this to the highest level and have requested an immediate stop on his deportation until I have had the opportunity to speak to the immigration minister about his decision.'

A Home Office spokesperson said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules.

'When someone has no right to be here, we expect them to leave the country voluntarily. Where they do not we will seek to enforce their departure.'
