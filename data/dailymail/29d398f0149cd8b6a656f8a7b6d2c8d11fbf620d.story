Ryan Hall is a master of timing, whether he is waiting to charge all 16st 7lb of his enormous frame down the wing or teaching himself to play a piano sonata.

In a profession where brawn is often prized over brains, Hall is proud he can play the saxophone, piano and guitar and complete the Rubik’s cube in less than a minute.

‘I’ve always been good at maths and music and if anyone ever asks, I’ll tell them,’ he said, ‘I’m not shy about that. I sometimes get a bit of stick from the lads but if we’re out for a meal I can add up the bill quite quickly, so it has its upsides.’

Hall now has to work out a formula to help his Leeds Rhinos team start winning again. Despite lifting the Challenge Cup last month, mainly thanks to a man-of-the-match performance and two steamroller tries from Hall, Leeds have lost their last five Super League games.

They plummeted to sixth in the league and head into Saturday’s play-off match against Catalan Dragons needing to win or facing elimination.

‘We’ve not taken the end of the season too much to heart,’ said Hall, ‘We know we could have finished top of the table potentially but all the talk now is the playoffs, we’re treating it as a separate competition.

‘We have the opportunity to do the double which would be something remarkable given how close the table is. Wigan did it last year and showed it’s possible to do it in the modern era.’

Hall, who is known as WBW – or world’s best winger – by his teammates has proven he is a big occasion player. ‘I’ve been faced with these do-or-die games a couple of times and come out on top so hopefully I’m a bit of an inspiration to the younger players around me,’ he said.

The 26-year-old, who is also part way through an accountancy degree, credits his love of music with keeping him focused on rugby. ‘You have a lot of spare time as a professional sportsperson and I spend mine wisely, music a good release and a way to relax,’ he said, ‘My mum always wanted me to do music at school to get another string to my bow and I loved it even though none of my circle of friends did it.

‘I’ve now got a two-year-old, Harry, and I’m encouraging him to be musical. He absolutely loves rugby already, the crowds and the music and everything. I think if I was to push him into anything it would be golf because their careers last longer and they don’t have as many injuries.’

Hall and his fiancée Vicky, who fostered a child before having Harry, also have their own special day coming up. The pair will marry on New Years Eve, but Hall may be taking a break from preparations.

‘I’m hoping to get picked for the England squad for the tour in Australia for six weeks so she’ll be 100% in charge,’ he said, ‘We’ve had a couple of arguments already about that one.

‘People have told me in the past that getting married is stressful but I just shrugged my shoulders. But it really is. I’ve got a realistic head on my shoulders when it comes to money whereas Vicky thinks about money last.

But with the Challenge Cup, hopefully the Grand Final and a wedding it will certainly be a good year to look back on if it all goes to plan.’
