The New York City taxi driver who struck a 23-year-old British tourist in Manhattan over the summer, causing her to lose a leg, will not face any criminal charges, it was revealed today.

Sian Green had to have her left leg amputated after the cab lost control and slammed into her, severing her foot, outside Rockefeller Center August 20.

On Thursday, her attorney released a statement saying that he has been informed by the assistant district attorney investigating the case that no criminal charges will be pressed against cabbie Faysal Himon.

Crushing blow: An attorney representing Sian Green (left), 23, said that he was told by a prosecutor there was not enough evidence to charge cabbie Faysal Himon (right) in the August crash that left Green without a leg

‘The Green Family is shocked by this news, and disappointed,’ attorney Daniel Marchese stated.

The
 lawyer went on to say that he was told by the prosecutor there was not 
enough evidence to demonstrate that Himon intended to hit Green.

Mr Marchese added that despite the bad news, Green continues to make progress in her recovery since returning to the U.K.

‘While
 she is incredibly dismayed by this decision, she does not let it affect
 her positive spirit, unbelievable strength and incredible poise, which 
she demonstrated to the world throughout this ordeal,’ the statement 
read.

Marchese insisted that
 the incident that left his young client without a leg was not an 
accident, but rather the result of ‘a negligent act of calculated 
recklessness.’

The attorney has vowed to continue to pursue legal action in the case.

In an interview on the Today Show in September, Green, of Leicester, U.K., said she plans to return to New York someday.

She said: 'I hope to come back one day. It’s not the city’s 
fault. It was the man who made a bad choice, I can’t blame the city for 
that.  It’s a beautiful city and I’d love to come back.'

The aspiring model told the New York Post after being discharged from the hospital that she will not let the horrific incident 
destroy her dreams.

Green's
 Facebook account shows that the 23-year-old woman has been keeping 
busy, spending time with friends and attending parties.

One
 picture posted last month showed the 23-year-old employee of the Hugo 
Boss fashion house posing in a green dress with a pair of girlfriends at
 a soiree while holding onto a walker. 

The crash happened on the second day of her trip to the city and she did not get to do the things she wanted.

Optimistic: Sian Green spoke publicly for the first time today since the horrific Manhattan taxi accident in which she lost her leg five weeks ago

Upbeat: Sian Green spoke for the first time since the horrific accident on the Today show on Tuesday and thanked strangers for saving her life. She appeared on the show with best friend Keshia Warren (left) who she described as her 'rock'

Hero: Green said if it wasn't for the actions of strangers who rushed to help she wouldn't have survived the accident. David Justino (right) used a belt to make a  tourniquet for her leg, while celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz (left) also raced to the scene

'The only thing I really wanted to do was go to the top of the Empire 
State Building,' she said. 'I wanted to go shopping, meet up with a few friends, do the 
typical New York things.'

Passersby rushed to help Miss Green immediately after the incident. Plumber David Justino used his belt to make a life-saving tourniquet for her leg while a pizza truck owner raced to put her foot on ice.

They were also helped by celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, better known on U.S. TV as Dr Oz, who hurried to the scene from his nearby office.

Her appearance in the Today studio took place just one block from the scene of the crash.

During her appearance on the Today show, Green admitted that she does have some unpleasant flashbacks: 'I haven't been out in five weeks. It takes me back a little bit, even when I see a yellow car.... But I'll get there.'

The 23-year-old brunette, who appeared in a wheelchair with what remains of her left leg bandaged, told the show of her memories of the accident. 'I couldn't move,' she said. 'It was one of those things. If I had gone left, it would have 
gotten me, if I had gone right, it would've gotten me.'

Investigation: No charges were filed against the taxi driver in the incident, who reportedly lost control of car after an argument with a cyclist and ploughed into Miss Green

Driver Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon of Queens, New York, 24, has been charged with seven traffic violations in the last three years.

He is believed to have gotten into an argument with cyclist Kenneth Olivo, 40, who reportedly also has a criminal history, just before the crash.

Friends and relatives say Green's naturally good-spirited nature has helped her through a hard five weeks.

'It's quite difficult, but she's a very optimistic person,' Sian's sister Stacey told Today. 'She just takes it day by day.'

Aspirations: Sian Green hoped to become a model and was training to be a buyer for Hugo Boss

Green said her most vivid memory of the day 
is walking around the city, getting a drink, going to Times Square and 
having a great time with her best friend, Keshia Warren.

Miss
 Green paid tribute to her friend, who was with her during the accident 
and hasn't left her side since. 'She's been my rock,' Green said. 'I 
couldn't do half the things without her, I really couldn't.'
