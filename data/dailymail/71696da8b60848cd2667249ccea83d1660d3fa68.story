Premier League chief executive Richard 
Scudamore said: ‘We are open to developments that enhance the 
competition and it was clear from watching the World Cup that vanishing 
spray benefited referees, players, and all of those who watched the 
matches.’

The spray will also be used in the Champions League and Europa League, but the Football League will trial it for one season in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy.

The FA, meanwhile, are expected to submit a proposal to the FA Cup committee for its use in the competition.

The spray will make its Premier League debut when Manchester United take on Swansea City on August 16.
