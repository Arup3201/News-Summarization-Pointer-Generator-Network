A young Christian girl accused burning pages of the Islam's holy book has been freed from a jail near the capital and taken by helicopter to a secret location in a dramatic operation.

The release of Rimsha Masih comes a day after a judge granted her bail.

Mushtaq Awan said Masih left the prison in Rawalpindi, a garrison city near Islamabad, this afternoon.

A blanket was used to cover her face in an attempt to protect her identity

She has been held for a little over three weeks after neighbours accused her of violating the country's strict blasphemy law.

She was taken from the prison in an armoured vehicle and whisked to a waiting helicopter while covered with a sheet to protect her identity.

Her lawyers say they will now push to have the case against her thrown out entirely.

There are worries the child, reported to be between 11 and 16, could be in danger if she remains in her homeland.

In Pakistan the mere allegation of causing offence to Islam can mean death.

Those accused are sometimes killed even if they are found innocent by the courts.

Police took cleric Khalid Jadoon into custody after witnesses claimed he ripped pages from a Koran and planted them in Rimsha's bag with burned papers.

Activists and human rights groups insisted Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law was vague and widely abused.

Live broadcasts showed heavily-armed police surrounding Rimsha Masih, believed to be no older than 14, covering her face with a green scarf

They claimed it dangerously discriminated against minority groups.

Amnesty International called the bail decision 'encouraging.'

A spokesman said: 'The Pakistan 
authorities must take concrete steps to show that no one can commit 
abuses and attempt to excuse them as the defence of their religion.

'The
 decision by a Pakistan court to grant bail to Rimsha Masih is an encouraging step, but the
 Pakistan government must urgently reform its blasphemy laws to prevent 
similar cases in the future.

'Rimsha
 and her mother were first arrested by police on August 16 after an 
angry mob had gathered outside their house in Islamabad, accusing her of
 burning pages of the Koran, a crime punishable by death under 
Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.

'The
 case took another turn last week when police arrested a local cleric, 
accused of planting the burned Koran pages on Rimsha.

'This morning (Friday), a judge set a bail of one million Pakistani rupees, about £6,200, for Rimsha.

'Although Amnesty  welcomes the judge’s decision, serious challenges remain.'

The human rights group claimed Rimsha, her family, and the Christian community in Islamabad remained in 'serious danger.'

Wilson Chowdhry is chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association.

He said: 'Although this is a small step 
towards justice, she will still have to undergo a full trial unless 
granted asylum in a western nation.  

'Her safety is paramount and security at today's court hearing was significant.

'However the killing of Governor Taseer illustrates that extra-judicial killings are hard to prevent.'

He was killed because he opposed the blasphemy law.

Lawyer Raja Ikram, one of Rimsha Masih's representatives, talks to journalists after the hearing in Islamabad. His client was granted bail after three weeks detention

He is joined by Paul J Bhatti, minister for national harmony, at a joint news conference. Several Islamist leaders have joined the outcry over the arrest

'We
 have asked the Foreign Office on their position with respect to 
granting asylum to Rimsha Masih and await a response,' said Wilson. 

'MP Andrew Stephenson of Pendle has said it is highly likely that the UK would grant Asylum.'

Rimsha's arrest triggered an exodus of 
several hundred Christians from her poor village after mosques reported 
over their loudspeakers what the girl was alleged to have done.

Christians, who make up four percent 
of Pakistan's population of 180 million, have been especially concerned 
about the blasphemy law, saying it offers them no protection.

Convictions hinge on witness testimony and are often linked to vendettas, they complain.

In
 2009, 40 houses and a church were set ablaze by a mob of 1,000 Muslims 
in the town of Gojra, in Punjab province following reports of the 
desecration of the Koran.

At least seven Christians were burned to death during the attacks.

Two
 Christian brothers accused of writing a blasphemous letter against the 
Prophet Mohammad were gunned down outside a court in the eastern city of
 Faisalabad in July of 2010.  

Pakistani Christians carry placards  in Islamabad during a protest calling for the release of Rimsha. There have been calls to review Pakistan's blasphemy laws

Amnesty International warned the case could cause problems for 'communal harmony' in Pakistan.

'In
 the recent past individuals accused of blasphemy have been killed by 
members of the public, often in incidents where the victim has not been 
formally charged by the authorities,' the Amnesty spokesman said.

'Hundreds
 of Christians have fled Rimsha’s neighbourhood in Islamabad since she 
was accused, fearing violence. Her family remains in hiding.  

'The Rimsha Masih case highlights the profound danger to communal harmony and rule of law caused by Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.

'Such
 cases will continue to occur, especially against vulnerable religious 
minorities, unless the Pakistan government urgently reforms the 
blasphemy laws to ensure they cannot be used maliciously to settle 
disputes or enable private citizens to take matters into their own 
hands.'

Amnesty called on the authorities
 to ensure perpetrators of attacks on religious minorities were brought 
to justice in court that met international standards - without recourse 
to the death penalty.

'Amnesty welcomes the condemnation of
 the charges brought against Rimsha Masih by a wide cross-section of 
Pakistan society, including even from religious leaders who have in the 
past vilified religious minorities and advocated strict application of 
the blasphemy laws, including the imposition of the death penalty,' the spokesman said.

'But more important are legal, policy
 and social reforms to address the general climate of vilification on 
the basis of religion that has lead to almost daily intimidation and 
deadly attacks on Christian, Shi’a, Ahmedi, Hindu and other minority 
communities across the country.

'The Pakistan authorities must take 
concrete steps to show that no one can commit abuses and attempt to 
excuse them as the defence of their religion.'
