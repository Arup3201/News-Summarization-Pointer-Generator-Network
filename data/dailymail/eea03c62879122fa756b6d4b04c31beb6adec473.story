Nottingham Forest have won a £250,000 transfer fund to spend in the January window, despite being subject to a Football League embargo.

Forest supporter Shaun Lander earned his side the prize as Sky Bet's Transfer Fund competition came to an end on Tuesday lunchtime, just over 24 hours after the Football League put Forest, along with Championship rivals Blackburn and Leeds, under an embargo for breaching financial fair play rules.

But the League's chief executive Shaun Harvey confirmed that Stuart Pearce's men will still receive the windfall, however it can only be spent on the wages of players signing on a free transfer or on loan.

But boss Stuart Pearce can only spend it on wages

'They can use the money in terms of paying loan wages but not transfer fees,' he told Sky Sports News.

A shortlist of 10 fans was selected at random from 70,000 customers of the Football League's title sponsors and Lander was announced as the lucky winner in the draw at Wembley - securing his club the bumper prize as well as a £5,000 cheque for himself.

The clubs that missed out at the final hurdle were Huddersfield, Fulham, Cardiff, Leeds, Watford, Wigan, Southend and Exeter.

Blackburn, Leeds and Forest were given a transfer ban for the January window after breaching the Football League's FFP rules.

The League announced that the three clubs all incurred financial losses more than the £8million permitted during last season.

Submissions from QPR, Leicester and Burnley - who were all promoted to the Premier League - plus the three clubs relegated last season will now be considered by the Football League.

Under the transfer embargoes, the three clubs will be prohibited from signing any new players - either on a permanent or loan deal - unless they have 24 or fewer 'established players', which is described as 24 players aged 21 or over that have made at least five starts for the club.
