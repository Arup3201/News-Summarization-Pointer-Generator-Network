Property prices may be booming once more across vast swathes of Britain, but spare a thought for owners across the Channel.

For while UK prices have soared by almost 11 per cent over the past year, the market in France has hit rock-bottom. Homes there have plunged in value since their peak in 2008, meaning UK buyers can now pick up a 12-bedroom chateau in sunny Toulouse for the cost of a humble Home Counties semi.

Jasmine Harman, who presents Channel 4’s A Place In The Sun, said: ‘You may never get an opportunity like this again to buy property in France. There are some fantastic bargains.’

Here’s our pick of the homes currently up for sale…
