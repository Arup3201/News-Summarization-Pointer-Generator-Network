A primary school where more than 90 per cent of pupils have English as their second or even third language is one of the highest-achieving in the country

Less than seven per cent of the 240 students at St Peter's Catholic Academy, in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, hold English as their mother tongue, with many pupils joining the school without knowing a word of English.

Altogether, 93.3 per cent of the children speak English as a second or even third language - with their first language including Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Polish, Kurdish, Filipino, Czech, Arabic, Turkish, Slovak, Bulgarian, German, Malayalam, Portuguese or Slovak.

Other languages at the school include Tagalog, an Austronesian language; Yoruba, a west African dialect from Benin; Shona, from Zimbabwe; Chichewa, a Malawi language; Pangasinan, from the Philippines; Pashto, from Afghanistan and Bemba, spoken in northern Zambia.

Half of the youngsters are from Pakistani heritage backgrounds - while others come from Bangladeshi, Indian, African and Roma cultures.

However, despite being one of the most multi-cultural schools in Britain, it is also one of the highest-achieving - with its school-leavers achieving above the national average in reading, writing and maths.

The state academy, which caters for girls and boys aged three to 11, received an 'outstanding' rating in its 2011 Ofsted report.

St Peter's claims its success is down to its approach in supporting youngsters who speak English as an additional language, suggesting it could provide valuable lessons for other UK schools.

The school has extra staff, particularly in the nursery and infants, and they 'immerse' the children in the English language from day one, with vibrant displays in classrooms and corridors.

The children work in small groups for activities and every class takes part in a 'literacy circle' once a week.

Dianne Mason, executive headteacher of St Peter's, said coping with such a large number of pupils from different backgrounds is due to investment in quality staff. 

She said: 'I've got outstanding teachers. I can't have anything less than outstanding.

'Pupils have a visual timetable and there are pictures on the drawers. It's so they can start to remember the words by looking at the pictures.

'They will have five or six members of staff in the literacy circle, who read with the children. They read a quality book, take it home, and then bring it back to discuss it - children love it.

'That enthusiasm is infectious. Pupils are also keen to help their classmates learn English.

'We're concerned that they become fluent in their own language first - then they can learn English.

'When you ask a child a question, unless they have really good English, they tend to translate it into their own language, formulate an answer, and then translate that answer into English.

'They need more time to answer a question. People say it can take seven years for a child to fully understand another language, with all the inferences.

'But with support, they do catch up. We try lots of strategies. There's no let-up.'

Some families of pupils at the school have relocated to Stoke-on-Trent through their jobs or to be near relatives. 

Suhayla Bint-Ahmed, 10, from Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, who has been learning about cultures, said: 'My first language is Bengali and my friend speaks Tagalog.

'She's taught me how to count in her language and I've taught her how to count in mine. I think it's cool that we're such a multicultural school.'

Another pupil Uswa Mirza, 11, started at St Peter's in October last year and only began learning English weeks earlier.

She said: 'I speak Urdu and German and was living in Germany before.

'When I started at this school, it wasn't easy. But they gave me a dictionary so I could understand what words meant.

'My mum and cousins can also speak English and have helped me.'

However, other children who grew up in the area still arrive at school knowing little English because their parents speak other languages at home. 

Victoria Foksa, 10, can still remember what it was like to join the school knowing no English.

She said: 'It was scary at first. But the teachers helped me and so did my friends. I feel I've learnt so much. My first language is Polish and my first word in English was "hello".'

Fellow pupil Uswa Mirza, 11, is one of the most recent recruits having started at St Peter's in October and only began learning English weeks earlier.

She said: 'I speak Urdu and German and was living in Germany before. When I started at this school, it wasn't easy.

'But they gave me a dictionary so I could understand what words meant. My mum and cousins can also speak English and have helped me.'

A new national report has found wide variations in the achievements of English Additional Language (EAL) pupils.

It says support in the classroom can be a postcode lottery because of uneven funding distribution and has called for resources to be more effectively targeted at those most in need.

The report also suggests youngsters who come to the UK from Portuguese, Somali and Lithuanian backgrounds have especially low outcomes at school, while Russian and Spanish speakers do far better.

In 2012, it emerged the 414 pupils at English Martyrs' Catholic School in Birmingham spoke 31 languages between them.

A documentary about Gascoigne Primary School in Barking, East London, where youngsters speak over 60 languages is set be aired on Channel 5 on Thursday.
