Three teenage girls who were run down and killed by a hit-and-run driver while trick-or-treating in Southern California have been identified.

Twins Lexi Perez and Alexandra Perez and Andrea Gonzalez, all aged 13, were in Santa Ana for Halloween when they were hit by a truck while crossing the road.

Their names were released as police continued to search for two suspects who fled the scene in the aftermath, dumping their SUV before escaping on foot. 

The impact of the crash caused the girls to be thrown more than 100 feet, according to KTLA 5.

Victims: Twins Lexi Perez and Alexandra Perez, 13, were run down and killed by a hit-and-run driver while out trick-or-treating in Santa Ana, Southern California, on Friday night 

Tragic: Andrea Gonzalez, also 13, was killed as she tried to cross the road with their friends 

Police are still searching for the two suspects in the car at the time the three girls, including the twins (pictured) were hit. They were said to be in costume and carrying candy bags at the time

All of the youngsters were said to be in costume and carrying candy bags when the vehicle struck them at a 'high rate of speed'. 

Magaly Huerta, the twins' aunt, says her family is in complete shock. She told ABC 7 : They killed what we love the most. Why couldn't they stop the car when they saw my nieces? Why they couldn't do anything? I know God will punish them sooner or later.'

The girl's mother said: 'I cannot believe this.' 

The Alexandra and Lexi Perez Huerta Memorial Fund Facebook page was created Saturday and asked for donations for the girls' funeral expenses.

Family, friends and residents left flowers and lit candles for the trio following the tragic incident. Some remained at the memorial site all day as they tried to come to terms with the loss. 

A 2001 Honda CRV, the vehicle which is believed to have been driven into them, was found nearby after officers said the suspects sped off and headed north.

Jeff Evans, who was trick-or-treating with his eight-year-old daughter nearby at the time said he heard squealing tires, looked over and saw the gruseome scene.

He told the O.C Register: 'When we got over here, there was already a tarp over two girls,' Evans said.

Briana Magana, 13, said she attended Santiago Charter Middle School  with one of the victims.

She told the paper the pair had attended a school dance earlier in the day and had later gone for lunch at McDonald's. 

'It's unbelievable how something like this could happen,' Briana said. 'She always had a smile, she would light up the room, and she was just a really good student.'

Memorial: Billy and Rose Weatherley offer silent prayers at a make-shift memorial where three 13-year-old girls were hit

One witness followed the SUV involved in the incident. When they stopped they reported seeing two men get out of the vehicle and flee on foot.

Department Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told the station: 'Witnesses say the vehicle was traveling at a high-rate of speed. I didn't see any skid marks, so it doesn't appear they slowed down whatsoever.

'They left these three young women laying in the street, and left without calling, without stopping, without rendering aid. It's hard to even fathom doing that.'

'At this point, we need the community's help, anybody that saw these individuals. Did they call somebody? Did they get picked up? Were they seen running on foot past the freeway?' Bertagna said. 'People are going to be talking about this. These individuals could be talking about this.'

Response: Paramedics rushed to the crash site but two of the girls were pronounced dead at the scene. The third died while she was being taken to hospital
