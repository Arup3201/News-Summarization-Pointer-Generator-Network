There is a bar in the labyrinth of alleyways around Las Ramblas that is named in honour of the famous Barcelona youth academy, La Masia.

On Friday night, it was packed tight with Barca fans and locals watching Getafe play Espanyol on the old television set fixed high on a wall in a corner.

It was bedecked with Barcelona memorabilia, its walls plastered with team posters celebrating the glories of the last decade, pictures from Wembley after the Champions League triumph of 2011 and from Yokohama, later that year, when Barca won the Club World Cup.

And by the door, there was a drawing of Barack Obama. ‘Crisis?’ he was saying from a speech bubble. ‘Calm down. There’s nothing to see here.’

Until Saturday, it seemed to fit the mood. Barcelona were supposed to be in meltdown around the turn of the year, with rumours of a schism between Lionel Messi and new coach Luis Enrique.

But they had recovered spectacularly, winning their last 11 games in succession and scoring 23 times in their previous five league games. Everyone thought the old Barca were back.

The general assumption was that Saturday’s match against Malaga at Camp Nou would bring victory as a formality and act as a prelude to crushing Manchester City in the Champions League round of 16 for a second consecutive year.

The Catalan newspapers were unanimous about what the match against Malaga would yield: three points to take Barcelona back to the top of La Liga by leap-frogging Real Madrid and a hat-trick from Messi to lift him above Cristiano Ronaldo in the battle to be el pichichi, the league’s leading scorer.

But things didn’t go to plan. Barcelona lost 1-0, their first home defeat since a November 1 defeat by Celta Vigo, and the air of confidence that had surrounded their visit to the Etihad Stadium for the first leg of their tie on Tuesday evaporated.

So forget the speech bubble in the La Masia bar. Every defeat is a crisis here. And now there is something to see. Now, pleas for calm will go unheard and City and their fans will feel fresh hope that this is, indeed, a Barcelona side incapable of scaling the heights of old.

When the final whistle sounded on Saturday afternoon, the Barcelona players headed straight down the tunnel as the club hymn blared from the loudspeaker system, doing its best to drown out the chorus of whistles from the crowd.

By then, there were swathes of empty blue and red seats all around the cavernous bowl of the Nou Camp. All the uncertainties, all the fears that had assailed them earlier in the season had come flooding back. Barcelona were desperately poor. They looked listless, unsettled, agitated and bereft of ideas against Malaga, who had chances to add to the winning goal scored by Juanmi in the seventh minute.

Luis Suarez, who has been showing signs of overcoming the disappointing start to his career here since his £70m summer move from Liverpool, was close to anonymous again, noticed only on the multiple occasions he was caught offside.

Tuesday’s tie will mark his first return to England since the leaving of Liverpool and he is a figure much reduced. At Anfield, he was larger than life. He was the biggest story in town, the team’s most talented player and the man the fans looked to for inspiration. It is different here. He is in the shadow of another now. Not just Messi but Neymar, too, and he is finding it hard to adapt. Maybe a visit to England will give him a fresh burst of bloody-minded motivation.

Neymar struggled, too, and even Messi failed to make an impression. Stuck out wide on the right, he curled in a few sumptuous crosses but they either sailed just too high or were headed clear by Malaga’s massed defence.

City will have been encouraged by the defensive vulnerability exhibited by Tuesday’s opponents, too. Juanmi’s goal came courtesy of a shocking defensive error by Dani Alves and, with better finishing, Malaga would have capitalised on several swift counter-attacks.

Barcelona may be a different side in Manchester this week but City showed them way too much respect in the first leg at the Etihad last season. Saturday's game provided ample encouragement for them to be more ambitious this time.

This is not the Barcelona of old. This is not a team capable of dominating European football as they once did. Their crown has been slipping for some time, as anyone who recalls their Champions League annihilation by Bayern Munich will know. This is a team trapped in the tortures of transition.

If Madrid win at Elche today, they will go four points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga, adding to the feeling that the energy and the vigour in La Liga resides with them. When Cristiano Ronaldo usurped Messi as the world’s best player by retaining Fifa’s Ballon d’Or award this year, it was another sign of the shift in power.

Neymar was also off the boil and struggled, which can only be a good thing for the English champions

A fin de siècle feeling seems to be settling over the Nou Camp. It was beautiful while it lasted but the great side moulded by Pep Guardiola is breaking up. Xavi, Barcelona’s great general, turned 35 a few weeks ago. Tiki-taka is passé, superseded by the power and pace of Bayern Munich and Real. The zeitgeist has moved on.

Messi is still a magician, of course. Paul Scholes wrote in his newspaper column last week that ‘it is never a bad day when you can watch one of the best footballers ever pull on a pair of boots’ and, of course, he is right.

It is still a privilege to watch Messi play. Even on days like Saturday, some of his touches and some of his passing was sublime. But even he looked fretful. Individually, Messi, Neymar and Suarez are three of the best players in the world. As a forward line, though, they look like an awkward fit.

It is nine years ago on Sunday that Messi first impressed himself on the wider English consciousness when he produced a scintillating performance in a Barcelona Champions League victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

The Chelsea left-back, Asier del Horno, was sent off for kicking Messi into the air near the corner flag in the first half, which brought forth accusations of play-acting from Jose Mourinho, still in his first coming as Chelsea manager.

But the Argentine produced a scintillating performance, although he did not manage to score

Messi, for the crime of being hacked by opposing defenders, was assailed by the wrath of one newspaper in particular. ‘You Dirty Dog Messi,’ its headline read.

Messi has been making headlines ever since. The world has been unable to take its eyes off him as he has become one of the greatest players in the history of the game. The feeling here is that, for all their stars, Barcelona are more dependent upon him than they have ever been.

If they are to stave off further decline, if they are to quell fresh talk of crisis, he will have to be at his very best on Tuesday night in Manchester because, after Saturday, City will smell blood.
