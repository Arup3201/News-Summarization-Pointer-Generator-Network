Apple's holiday season proved to be a disappointment even though the company sold an all-time record number of iPhones and iPads during its latest quarter that ended on December 28.

The fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Monday topped analyst 
projections, but Apple sold fewer iPhones than Wall Street had been 
anticipating.

Management also forecast revenue for the current quarter that fell below analysts' predictions - despite moving 51 million iPhones, 26 million iPads and 4.8 million Macs.

Apple broke all-time sales records for iPhones and iPads in the last quarter, and reported a $13.1billion profit on $57.6billion revenue. However, the figures disappointed Wall Street and analysts had expected this to be even higher

Following the earnings call, Apple's stock shed $41.62, or more than 7.5 per cent, to $508.88. By the end of after-hours extended trading, the shares had plummeted further putting the total loss at almost 9 per cent

Those letdowns caused Apple's stock to shed $41.62, or more than 7.5 percent, to $508.88 in extended trading after the release of results.

The company sold 51 million iPhones during the three months ending just after Christmas. That marked a 7 percent increase from the previous record of nearly 48 million iPhones set a year earlier.

Analysts, though, were expecting even bigger things and had predicted about 55 million iPhones in what is traditionally the company's best quarter.

Apple's stock had been rising on the expectation that the company would clear the hurdle.

Hotcakes: Apple sold 51 million iPhones during the three months on December 28. That marked a 7 percent increase from the previous record of nearly 48 million iPhones set a year earlier. But analysts had predicted they would move 55 million units

Apple sold 26 million iPads during the quarter, in line with analyst predictions. The iPad volume represented a 14 percent increase from the same time in 2012 when they sold 22.9 million units.

The Cupertino, California, company sold 4.8 million Macs, compared to 4.1 million in the year-ago quarter.

Apple Inc. earned $13.07 billion, or $14.50 per share, in the quarter. That's roughly unchanged from $13.08 billion, or $13.81 per share, in the prior year.

The per-share figure increased because Apple had fewer shares outstanding in the recent quarter. Revenue rose 6 percent to $57.6 billion.
