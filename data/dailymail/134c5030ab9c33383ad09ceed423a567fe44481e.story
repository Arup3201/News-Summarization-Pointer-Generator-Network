Christian Wade's wonder try against Leinster in Dublin on Sunday is unlikely to earn him an immediate England recall, but the Wasps wing believes it will reignite his game after a difficult year.

The 23-year-old brought the house down at the RDS Arena by leaving three opponents in his slipstream to produce a glorious solo strike in his club’s European Champions Cup defeat. 

Hours later, he was feted by Irish and English fans alike as he walked through Dublin airport with his team-mates, but it is understood that his latest scoring feat has not convinced the England coaches to include him in their autumn Test squad.

Christian Wade of Wasps breaks clear to score a try against Leinster but will not be recalled by England

Sportsmail has learned that Wade is due to be included in the Saxons squad and will have to bide his time in the hope of winning a second international cap. But having missed most of last season with a foot injury which proved tough to overcome, the Lion feels that his try on Sunday will serve to kick-start his game again.

‘I was really excited and happy to score,’ he said. ‘Scoring tries like that makes me feel like my old self again and that will give me real confidence going forward. I’ve just got to play as much rugby as I can and see what else I produce.

‘For me it’s been a difficult last year really. I had the injury and was out for about nine months. In the first few games I played after that I was obviously trying to feel my way back into it. I wasn’t holding back, I was trying to do my best but I was making mistakes. I have kept trying to get better every week and put some good performances together.’W

Wade made his one and only England appearance against Argentina in June last year

Recalling his blistering run to the line, Wade added: ‘It was in broken-field play and the boys got it out to me. I had a bit of space and I think it was Madigan who was in front of me. I had a one-on-one with him and I was able to stand him up, get on the outside and from there it was straight run – a race into the corner.

‘For wingers, our main job is to finish off tries and also to get over the gainline. That is something that I have always done but I know that I can’t just rely on scoring tries – I also have to have the right defensive mind-set. I know that as a winger I have to be good at defending, at the wide breakdowns, the high balls and the kick-chase. I have to make sure I get my all-round game right.’

Wade is destined to miss out when Stuart Lancaster names his autumn squad on Wednesday. Wing is among the most open areas of the field in terms of England selection, with Marland Yarde, Chris Ashton, Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson believed to be the leading four candidates, while Semesa Rokoduguni and Jonny May are also in the mix.
