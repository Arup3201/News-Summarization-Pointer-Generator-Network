Severe weather in Baltimore, Maryland may have produced a few tornadoes. Community members have been sending in pictures of funnel clouds to local news stations and papers, with damage reported in western Woodbine, and additional sightings in bay-side Locust Point and Brooklyn. 

While many of these pictures and video look unmistakably like tornadoes, the National Weather Service still hasn't defined them as such.

Christine Schifkovitz, who works at a yacht service on the bay said in a video on The Baltimore Sun's website that she observed a funnel cloud at about 3:30 p.m. Monday.

Schifkovitz and her coworkers went outside when they heard on the radio that a tornado was forming near them. She recorded video as the sky above them turned black and a funnel formed over the water.  

Then the tornado started causing damage: 'We heard this loud ripping noise and it actually ripped a roof off and we saw debris fly up in the air,' she said.

On the opposite side of Baltimore, in rural Woodbine, there was more damage.

Bill Davison and his parents had just finished dinner when they heard the storm hit, and the power cut off.

Davison says he heard 'a loud wind' and saw cardboard flying around outside.

'I was like, "Dad, come look at this." He goes out to the garage and calls me a says, "The garage is gone,"' Davison told WJZ 13.

Davison's father said,'[I saw] what I thought was [a funnel], yeah. It just came right back down black, swirling, picking up material, so to me, it looked like the closest thing I've ever seen to a tornado.'

A car parked in the garage was moved seven or eight feet, some things are completely missing, while they found some items far away.

'My tires in the shed landed half a mile down the street. It's something you only see in the movies,' Bill Davison said. 'I can't believe it; I'm still in shock.'

The severe weather warnings are now over in Baltimore, but officials are saying Baltimore residents should remain cautious.

'Just be very careful in this area. We have a lot of down trees, a lot of downed wires, a lot of standing water, so we are encouraging people not to drive through it and really just exercising caution over the next few hours,' said Jacqueline Cotei, representative of Howard County Fire and Rescue.
