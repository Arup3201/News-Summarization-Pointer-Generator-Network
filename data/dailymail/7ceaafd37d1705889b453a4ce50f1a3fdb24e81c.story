Three Walt Disney employees were among 23 suspected child sex predators arrested in a week-long police sting launched to coincide with Valentine's Day.

The men brought items including whipped cream-flavored vodka, marijuana and a McDonald's Happy Meal to a vacant house in Clermont, Florida, where they thought they were meeting children as young as 13.

They were lured there by detectives posing as children in online chat rooms as part of an undercover operation dubbed 'Be Mine'.
