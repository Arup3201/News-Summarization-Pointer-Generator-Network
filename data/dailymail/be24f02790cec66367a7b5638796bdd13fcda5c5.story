These two tiny rock figurines thought to have been worth just £200 have stunned the art world after selling for a staggering £180,000.

The 2ins long pieces of two Chinese boys playing with a dog and a drum were carved out of agate stone and thought to date back to the 19th century.

They were offered for sale by an unnamed English antiques dealer who was told to expect to receive between £200 to £300 for the pair.

But auctioneers began to suspect they had underpriced the pieces when they became inundated with inquiries from the Far East after the sales catalogue was published.

The Woolley and Wallis auction rooms in Salisbury, Wilts, was packed out with bidders, mostly from China, and all of their telephone lines were also taken up.

The saleroom held its breath as the bidding quickly went from three to four figure sums before reaching £50,000 in no time at all.

As bidders dropped out, it came down to two interested parties over the phone and they took the price into six figures.

The hammer came down on £150,000 but with all the fees added on the overall price paid was £180,000 - 900 times the original estimate.

The agate carvings went to an anonymous buyer from China who bid online.

Naturally, the seller was said to have been delighted with the price but the auctioneers remain stumped by the fee paid.

It
is believed the pieces date back to earlier than was thought and the 
two wealthy bidders were so determined to buy them they were happy to 
pay whatever it took.

The single lot symbolises the frenzied interest that currently exists in ancient Oriental antiques as the newly-rich Chinese go about buying back their heritage.

Auctioneer John Axford said: 'I can only assume the figures are far older than we estimated, with such tiny items it's very difficult to assign an age.'

John Berwald, a London-based expert dealer in Oriental art and antiques, said: 'It is a hell of a price.

'Chinese agate carvings date back to the 17th century.

'One can only assume that these pieces are much earlier in date, probably from the 18th century.

'Chinese agate carvings of boys are extremely rare, so that was also another factor in it.

'But if two people want an item enough and are happy to pay whatever it takes, then you can get these hugely inflated prices.'

Newly wealthy Chinese collectors have driven the prices of ceramics and antiquities to astonishing levels in recent years.
