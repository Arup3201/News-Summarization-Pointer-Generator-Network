There is a blog dedicated to her immaculate style and a Twitter account keeping you informed of her sartorial selections.

But if that's still not enough information about Michelle Obama's clothes and you want even more immediate access to her wardrobe, you'll thrill at the arrival of a new smartphone fashion app.

Following in the wake of her successful Duchess of Cambridge app Kate's Style List, Birmingham-based developer and clothes-lover Helen Barclay has created Michelle's Stye List, a 69p (99 cents) programme enabling you to emulate the dress sense of America's First Lady of Fashion.

President Obama's wife recently topped the first Sunday Times Best Dressed list, and she is universally regarded as one of the most elegant women in the world.

Some of the mother-of-two's favourite designers and brands include Jason Woo, Isabel Toledo, Roksanda Ilincic, Michael Kors, Narciso and J-Crew. And now you can be the first to know which she has chosen to step out in whenever she leaves the White House.

Helen, a former actress, said: 'Michelle Obama has a huge following in the US. She sells out clothes in the same way Kate Middleton does, and like the Duchess of Cambridge she recycles lots of her clothes.

'It is mainly aimed at the American market but I hope it will work here too.'

The app was launched last week and features spring, summer, autumn and winter collections of all of the First Lady's outfits.

The app describes what she is wearing, and each item is hyper-linked to take you directly to a page where you can buy or learn where to buy it.

Helen, 28, said: 'She is a role model in America - the whole family is. They are massive. They are the most important and powerful family in the world. She does lots of good things for people.

'Michelle dresses very appropriately, in that her outfit always reflects the occasion. She was seen recently at a sports day at a school wearing a track suit. Equally, at an event over Easter she was dressed in a very elegant dress.

'Whenever she appears at various events the app will tell you exactly what clothes she is wearing.'

Helen has given up her career on the dramatic stage to concentrate on digital apps following the success of the first app, which helps savvy shoppers create the Kate look. She is hoping Michelle's Style List will be equally popular.

'It's only been a week but so far it's been going really well,' she added.

Just like the Kate app, Helen developed her own programme to track and locate Michelle's fashion finds, and she keeps her users updated 24 hours a day.

Users can browse Michelle's favourite designers, compile lists of their favourite outfits, search by accessories and then find out where to purchase her most popular high street items.

Helen graduated from Hull University with a degree in theatre studies in 2005, and began acting in both TV commercials and on the stage.

She said: 'I have some more ideas for the future, but I am keeping them close to my chest.'
