More migrants came to Britain over the past decade than in the previous half century.

From 2001 to 2011, the number of foreign-born residents rose by 2.9million. Yet in the 50 years beforehand only an extra 2.7million arrived from abroad.

The figures – published by the Office for National Statistics yesterday – show the impact of Labour’s open-door immigration policy.

A new wave of migrants, from Romania and Bulgaria, is expected in the new year when labour market restrictions are lifted.

The two countries are the poorest in the EU and it is thought as many as 50,000 of their citizens a year will decamp to Britain.

The influx of Poles from 2004 has made them the second largest foreign-born group in the country, behind only Indians.

Because of the upheaval of the Second World War they occupied the same position in the 1950s, but then behind the Irish.

Successive decades saw the arrival of waves of Caribbeans, Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.

This
 pushed the foreign-born population up from 1.9million in 1951 to 
4.6million in 2001. By 2011, it had soared to 7.5million, fuelled 
largely by arrivals from Eastern Europe.

It means 13 per cent of the population of England and Wales now comes from abroad compared with just 4.3 per cent in 1951.

IRELANDMigration to Britain dates back to the famine of 1840s and 19th century industrialisation. But numbers have fallen in recent years, because younger generations have not replaced older Irish who have died.POLANDIn the wake of the Second World War Poles were the second largest group of foreigners in the UK, but through the latter 20th century were overtaken by Pakistan, Germany and USA. When Poland joined the EU there was a 10-fold increase in Poles in England and Wales from 2001 to 2011. INDIAIn 1951 India was the third highest country of birth and the Indian population in the UK almost doubled between 1961 and 1971. From 1961 until 2001 Indian-born was the second highest ranking non-UK country of birth and in 2011 became the largest foreign born population.PAKISTANThe third highest foreign-born population since the 1980s, the Pakistan-born population grew fastest between 1961 and 1971 to 136,000. Like India, the numbers have been fuelled by people moving to join family members and studying in the UK.JAMAICAIn the top 10 since 1961, the Jamaican-born population grew fastest from 1951, peaking in 1971 at 171,000 before falling to 160,000 in 2011.

‘Migration
 has contributed to just under half – 45 per cent – of the total 
population change of the last 60 years,’ the ONS report said.

Sir Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch think-tank said the statistics confirmed an influx without precedent in British history.

‘It
 is impossible to believe that this has happened by accident over such a
 long period. It could only have been deliberate policy.’ Sir Andrew 
said.

Two former Labour home secretaries apologised last month for 
blunders over Eastern European immigration.

Jack Straw said the policy had been a ‘spectacular mistake’ while Alan Johnson admitted ‘they got the sums wrong’.

The
 ONS report said: ‘Migration broadly is influenced by push and pull 
factors at source and destination, including economic condition, 
personal and national, pre-existing connections through family and 
cultural links, and political factors.

‘Cultural
 factors, including education and the wide use of the English language 
globally are also pertinent.

'Historic and Commonwealth ties may have 
influenced migrants’ choice of destination country.’

In
 some cases the ONS picture is skewed by historic movements of British 
people to foreign countries.

People from India living in the UK include
 those, such as Cliff Richard or Joanna Lumley, born during the last 
years of imperial rule.

The 7.5million figure for the number of foreign-born residents may be far too low, because it takes no account of illegal immigration.

A study from the London School of Economics estimated the number of people with no right to be here ranges from 417,000 to as high as 863,000.

Many will be overstayers who have remained after visitor or education visas ran out.

Others will be asylum seekers who have not returned home when their claims to refugee status have been rejected, or people who have smuggled themselves in, some from Calais to Kent ports.

Similarly,
 many German-born people here are children of British soldiers who 
served in Germany in the years after 1945.

‘For each of the top five 
non-UK countries of birth in 2011, migration to the UK in substantial 
numbers began at different times,’ the report said.

‘The
 Republic of Ireland had an earlier historical flow, with 38 per cent of
 Irish-born residents in 2011 arriving before 1961. By contrast 86 per 
cent of Polish-born residents arrived in 2004 or later.’

The Indian-born population doubled between 1961 and 1971, and the Bangladeshi-born population doubled in the 1980s, it said.

The
 major increase in immigration after 2001 included, alongside Poles and 
Eastern Europeans, increases in migration from Nigeria, Nepal, the 
Philippines, Spain and China, the ONS found.

More than 100,000 Nigerians arrived in the decade, spurred by civil conflict at home and opportunities in England.

The
 report added: ‘A peak in arrivals of Spanish-born residents can be seen
 in the period 2007-2009. This is most likely to be related to the 
economic crisis.’
