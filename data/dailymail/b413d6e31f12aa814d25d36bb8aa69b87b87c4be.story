A school teacher who allegedly showed teenaged pupils a documentary about Islamic State featuring decapitated soldiers has been suspended.

Mansoor Mahmood was said to have accidentally shown a clip featuring images of soldiers' heads on spikes to fourth-year pupils at Gryffe High School in Houston, Renfrewshire. 

The popular teacher was reported to council bosses after a parent complained to the police.

It is understood the woman's daughter was one of a group of pupils who were shown the 42-minute BBC documentary which portrayed dead Iraqi soldiers.

The students were reportedly left sickened by the footage, which also included images of soldiers' heads on spikes.

But one mother, who did not wish to be named, has described Mr Mahmood as 'an absolute gem' and said he was singled out for being a Muslim.

Her daughter is a fifth year pupil at Gryffe High School in Houston, Renfrewshire, and has said she is 'outraged' over the investigation into a 'really good teacher'.

Pupils from the school have launched two petitions to support Mr Mahmood, who started working at the school in August last year.

The mother said: 'He doesn't deserve this. He shared a news clip which, unbeknown to him, contained the footage and now he is facing disciplinary action.

'Some of the young people at Gryffe have set up petitions and Facebook pages to support Mr Mahmood.

'My daughter is absolutely outraged as she says he is actually a really good teacher.

'The footage has been shown on national TV, it has been on the Internet, on newspaper sites and to be honest, it is the horrific reality of the world.

'If it had been a history class and they had shown the depiction of William Wallace's head on the railings and his body decapitated, would it be any different?

'Yes, he made a mistake, but that footage is out there for the world to see and perhaps people should remember that.' 

She said: 'There is a huge undercurrent that it is Mr Mahmood's religion that has caused the real offence to the parents concerned.

'I support Mr Mahmood, we are short of great male teachers in the system and this could be an end to his career.

'You have to also ask yourself if this content was so graphic, why did the council's Internet protocols not block it?

'Just shows that it was on what was deemed to be a safe and appropriate site and that a young teacher is being blamed for trusting the system.

The popular teacher was reported to Renfrewshire council bosses after a parent complained to the police. It is understood the woman's daughter was one of a group of pupils who were shown the 42-minute BBC documentary which portrayed dead Iraqi soldiers.

'The kids are supporting the teacher 100 per cent.'

An online campaign named 'Keep Mr Mahmood in Gryffe' has been launched and has collected almost 100 signatures. 

One pupil said: 'Mr Mahmood should not be identified as 'the terrible teacher showing inappropriate videos', he's only showing the reality of the world.

'This is being blown out of proportion for just a good teacher doing his job.

'He should not be kicked out of Gryffe just because he's teaching the reality of things.'

Renfrewshire Council confirmed that Mr Mahmood had been reported to the General Teaching Council for Scotland.

A spokesman for the authority said the video was used as part of a lesson about ongoing issues in the Middle East.

He said: 'During a religious, moral and philosophical studies lesson, one fourth year class was shown a BBC narrated video about Islamic State.

'The clip was intended to provide pupils with an insight into the political and religious context in the Middle East as a basis for discussion.

'However following a complaint from a pupil, the material was reviewed and immediately withdrawn from use.

'No parents have complained to the school, however we value the opinion of our pupils and have acted accordingly.'

Even police were called to speak to staff at the school, but left after finding no criminal element to the single complaint.

Inspector Stevie Espie, of Johnstone Community Police, added: 'We were made award of this incident last Wednesday, on March 4, after being contacted by a parent whose daughter attends Gryffe High School.

'Police attended and spoke to the school staff. We also watched the video but found nothing criminal in relation to this.

'The school are now progressing with the enquiry but we will not be investigating the incident any further as there was nothing untoward found.'
