Chancellor George Osborne hinted the minimum wage could rise to £7-an-hour

The minimum wage could rise to as much as £7 an hour next year – adding a potential £1,225 a year to the pay packets of millions of workers, George Osborne signalled last night.

The Chancellor backed a dramatic 11 per cent increase in the current rate of £6.31 an hour, delighting Conservative MPs but alarming business leaders, who insisted it should not be increased by more than inflation.

His surprise intervention provoked an immediate backlash from business groups. The Federation of Small Businesses said the rate should not go up by more than inflation – currently just 2 per cent – while the Institute of Directors said it should be offset by a reduction in employers’ National Insurance contributions. The CBI said an unaffordable rise ‘would end up costing jobs’.

But Mr Osborne insisted low-paid workers should ‘enjoy the fruits’ of the economic recovery, suggesting that a rise would be carefully calibrated on the advice of the independent Low Pay Commission to avoid it affecting jobs or hurting employers.

His move is designed to counter Labour’s charge that the Government is overseeing a recovery for the few,  demonstrating that the proceeds of growth will be shared by all. It also appeared deliberately timed to eclipse a speech on living standards by Ed Miliband today.

The Low Pay Commission, which makes recommendations on the rate of the minimum wage, has been asked to look at restoring its value – undermined in real terms since the financial crash of 2008 and 2009.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin and Treasury minister Sajid Javid are among those who have backed a significant increase, the first part of which is expected to take effect in October.

It has been suggested that an increase could also save the Treasury significant sums in lower benefit claims and increased tax receipts.

Critics claim that the change will be 
difficult for many cash-strapped businesses to manage, and could lead to
 lay-offs or send some firms to the wall. However businesses may be 
offered more tax relief to compensate for an increased minimum wage.

Government
 sources said that further cuts to corporation tax or an increase to a 
new National Insurance relief might be used to help firms contend with a
 new minimum pay rate.

Mr 
Osborne said: ‘I think Britain can afford a higher minimum wage. I think
 we have worked hard to get to this point and we can start to enjoy the 
fruits of all that hard work.

‘I believe Britain can afford an above-inflation increase in the minimum wage so we can restore its real value for people.’

Since 2005 the minimum wage has risen by just a few pence, despite soaring inflation leaving workers worse off in real terms

The minimum wage rate stands at £6.31 for over-21s, but has fallen in value in real terms since the financial crash

He insisted that the exact figure 
would be set by the Low Pay Commission, adding: ‘If the minimum wage had
 kept in line with inflation it would be £7.

‘Just as we were all in this together in the crisis, I want to make sure we’re all in this together in the recovery.

Goldman Sachs has made the second highest amount from its investment banking division in its 145-year history.

Last year’s figures were beaten only by  those in 2007 – the year before the financial crisis struck.

The bank’s $6billion (£3.6billion) revenue bonanza helped fuel an average staff payout of £234,000.

The average full-time salary in the UK is £27,000.

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has unveiled a proposal to get round the cap on bonuses being limited to double bankers’ salaries – boosting their base salaries with a new payment called ‘role based pay’.

By inflating bankers’ salaries, they can continue to pay massive bonuses while still claiming that they are no more than  double basic pay.

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: ‘While millions suffer, Goldman Sachs is brazenly showing who the main beneficiaries of the recovery are with another bumper year for their investment bankers.

‘The very people who caused the crash are now hogging the fruits of recovery for themselves, and governments are letting them get away with it.’

‘Because
 we’re fixing the economy, because we’re working through our plan, I 
believe Britain can afford above-inflation increases in the minimum wage
 and make sure we have a recovery for all and that work pays.’

He
 added: ‘We are only in a position where we can contemplate an 
above-inflation increase in the minimum wage because we have taken 
difficult decisions to fix the British economy. The work is not yet half
 done.’

Last week he claimed
 any increase would be carefully thought through, saying: ‘I think 
everyone wants to see an increase in the minimum wage.

I
 would like to see an increase in the minimum wage. But it has to be 
done in a way that doesn’t cost jobs. We have a Low Pay Commission as a 
body that exists to make exactly that judgment.

‘We
 have got to get the balance right between supporting business, growing 
our economy and making sure it is a recovery for all, and that is what 
our long-term plan is all about.’

Yesterday
 Mr Duncan Smith welcomed the ‘bold move’, saying: ‘At the heart of all 
our reforms this Government is concerned to improve the quality of life 
for the poorest in society.’

Business
 minister Matthew Hancock, the first member of the Government to call 
for a significant minimum wage hike, said: ‘Modern Conservatives are 
passionate backers of the minimum wage, as part of a plan to make work 
pay and ensure everyone can benefit from the recovery.’

And
 David Skelton, founder of Renewal – a campaign group dedicated to ‘blue
 collar Conservatism’ – said: ‘For a party that once opposed the minimum
 wage this is momentous. It shows the Conservatives can become the real 
workers’ party, standing up for the low paid.’

However
 John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Although 
there is an increased disparity between the highest and lowest earners, 
arbitrarily raising the floor isn’t necessarily the solution and could 
make the UK economy uncompetitive in the long term.’
