Businesses attacked Labour last night over plans to force companies to share profits with employees.

Senior party figures are said to be considering a proposal to oblige all firms with more than 50 staff to set up a profit-sharing scheme.

Workers would then be handed a regular cash sum based on their employers' financial position.

Senior business leaders have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country

Labour last night said the idea was not official policy, although a shadow minister said it was being considered at the top of the party.

But senior business leaders warned the plan would encourage employers not to take on staff. It is the latest in a string of damaging clashes between Labour and business leaders – who have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country.

Glen Cooper, chief executive of Midlands bollard makers ATG Access, said: 'We need Britain's small companies to grow bigger, not be stifled by Labour's meddling.

'This idea will make companies stop taking on employees rather than grow. I am happy to run my own scheme to motivate my employees, but I don't want to be dictated to by Labour.'

The Labour policy would mirror the situation in economically feeble France, where companies with more than 50 employees have extra obligations, such as the establishment of a workers' council. It has been reported that such burdens are costing 140,000 jobs, and President Francois Hollande wants to repeal them.

Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs'

Simon Walker, of the Institute Of Directors, said: 'We cannot believe that the Labour leader will take such an obviously counterproductive measure seriously.

'Employee profit sharing can work well for companies who choose it, but it has to be up to them. This idea would give companies with 49 employees a very strong incentive not to grow.

'The French government is actually attempting to reduce the bureaucracy that kicks in at 50 workers because they know it is damaging job creation.'

Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels

Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs.

'Small companies should be run by the people who know their culture and staff best, not by central government.'

There are around 36,000 companies with 50 or more employees in Britain, employing a total of 12.9million. It means the suggested legislation would therefore affect about 53 per cent of those employed in the UK.

It is being championed by Gareth Thomas, a shadow minister and has been adopted by the affiliated Co-operative Party, represented in Parliament by 31 Labour MPs – including Ed Balls. 

Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels. He added: 'Hard work too often doesn't lead to higher wages for the working majority, but simply gets funnelled into greater rewards for those at the very top.'

A Labour source insisted last night the idea was not party policy. Tory MP Julian Smith said: 'This is another policy that will kill off jobs. Every Labour government in history has left unemployment higher.'

Mr Miliband has proposed a series of ideas which have infuriated business groups – including an energy price freeze and plans for more paternity leave. Bosses have also been riled by Labour's anti-business rhetoric.
