The Danish royals are about to be given a Hollywood makeover - two films are being made about the Crown Prince Of Denmark and his colourful love life. 

The first biopic, called Frederik's Young Years, will cover the Crown Prince Frederik's past as a prolific playboy. 

The second, called Mary: The Making of A Princess, will focus on his fairy tale romance with his now-wife, the Australian 'commoner' Mary Donaldson, who he met in a pub in Sydney 14 years ago.

Two films are to be made about Crown Prince Of Denmark's colourful love life. The first charts his younger years as a playboy in the 1990s. The second focuses on his fairy tale romance with his now-wife, the Australian 'commoner' Mary Donaldson, who he met in a pub in Sydney 14 years ago. The couple are pictured here with two of their four children, Princess Isabella and Prince Christian 

Both projects are expected to air on television by the end of the year, with the first funded partially by the Danish government and the latter produced by Australian company Fremantle Media.

The royals have been bracing themselves for Frederik's Young Years for the last couple of months, with movie producers expected to lift the lid on the prince's past as an eligible bachelor. 

He dated the former Danish MP Malou Aamund and a string of glamorous  models in the 1990s, including Katja Storkholm, to whom he allegedly proposed, before finally settling down with Mary.

The Danish actor-director Christian Tafdrup is casting for the biopic and has been given a grant of €27,000 (£21,183) towards the project by the Danish Film Institute.

He has spent a year researching and interviewing those close to the royals and is also rumoured to have had several conversations with Katja Storkholm about her relationship with Frederik.

But despite the film's subject, Christian has insisted that he is not looking to sensationalise the prince's love life. 

He is also planning on fictionalising a large part of the film. 

He told Danish film magazine Ekko: 'It's a fictional film about the royal family built on facts, inspired by the international wave of biopics about living people, it can be a dangerous area, but that is also part of the motivation.

'Royals are good characters in films – they have a god-like status and at the same time they must face the same challenges as everyone else.'

The film by Fremantle Media called Mary: The Making of A Princess is less likely to contain any clangers that could embarrass the royal family, as it focuses on the romance between Frederik and the now-Crown Princess of Denmark Mary. 

The script details the hurdles that 'commoner' Mary faced in adapting her normal and carefree life to that of a royal who is known globally for her great sense of style, much like Britain's Duchess Of Cambridge.  

Mary Donaldson from Tasmania first met Frederik in the bar of Sydney's Slip Inn during the 2000 Olympics.

Hobart-born Mary, who is the youngest daughter of a maths professor and a university secretary, was working at an advertising company as a marketing manager at the time, when the royal introduced himself to her as 'Fred'. 

Prince Frederik proposed to Mary during a holiday to Rome in September 2003, three years after they met

According to Hello magazine, she later said of the incident: 'The first time we met we shook hands. I didn't know he was the prince of Denmark. Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, "Do you know who these people are?"'

Prince Frederik returned to his homeland after the games but made several visits back to Australia to visit Mary and the couple went on short trips around the continent together. 

But it wasn't until April 2003 that Denmark's Queen Margrethe publicly acknowledged their relationship.

Frederik proposed a few months later during a holiday to Rome and the couple were married on May 14, 2004, in a lavish ceremony attended by royals - and media - from across the globe in Copenhagen Cathedral in the Danish capital.

It was described as the ultimate happy fairy tale ending with the Prince marrying the beautiful commoner;

The guest list included the kings and queens of Sweden, Norway, Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands as well as Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.

Frederik and Mary's first child Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John was born in October 2005 and the couple have since had another son called Prince Vincent and two daughters, Princess Josephine and Princess Isabella. 

Actresses Margot Robbie, 34, and Rose Byrne, 35, are both in the running to play Mary, but Fremantle's publicity manager Adrian Motte told The Guardian that no decision has been made on roles yet.

He said: 'We haven’t cast yet or shot a frame and we don’t have a director that we can announce at this stage but the project is being overseen by Fremantle Media Australia’s Head of Drama, Jo Porter.'
