A brutal murderer sent smirking selfies from his prison cell to several woman just weeks after marrying his childhood sweetheart.

Jamie Bain, 30, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 22 years after he gunned down former boxing champion Alex McKinnon at the Marmion pub in Edinburgh in 2006.

The killer sent pictures of himself next to a rack of expensive trainers while enjoying home comforts like television and a music system inside his cell at Shotts prison in Lanarkshire.

Jamie Bain, 30, took the selfies inside Shotts prison in Lanarkshire where he is serving time for the murder of former boxing champion Alex McKinnon who he gunned down at the Marmion pub in Edinburgh in 2006

One woman, who received the pictures and asked not to be named, said she was surprised to see how 'happy and relaxed' Bain looked.  

She said: 'He doesn't seem that bothered about his jail term. He looks like he's done his cell up with posters and flags so it all looks nice and home-like. I don't think it's fair on the victim's family to see him like that.'

Bain, known as the 'baby-faced assassin', is pictured lounging on a chair, wearing a Celtic top in one of the images.

In another, he sits cross-legged, smirking in a pair of blue shorts and flip-flops.

He and long-time fiancee Dionne Hendry married in a jail service conducted by Christopher Taylor, a priest at St Andrew's Church, Airdrie, in July.

But tying the knot has not stopped the shotgun killer from contacting other women from behind bars, it has been claimed.

Bain married his long-term fiancee in prison in July but continued to send the photographs - where he poses beside expensive trainers, a television and a music system - to a string of different women

One source said: 'I think he talks to loads of girls even though he's just got married. He has a phone and goes on Facebook, he uses loads of different names so they don't know it's him but his friends know who he is.

'They seem to always get phones in there - every time they're caught with one, they seem to get another.'

Bain was sent to jail in 2006 after he burst into the Edinburgh pub and produced a double-barrelled sawn-off shotgun concealed down his trouser leg.

He was wearing an ice hockey mask when he shot Mr McKinnon's brother-in-law James Hendry before firing at the 32-year-old former boxer as he turned to flee. 

Bain, who was 22 at the time of the murder - has reportedly been in trouble with the authorities for his mobile phone use in prison.

Officers stand outside Shotts prison in Lanarkshire where Bain is currently held behind bars. Despite being inside the maximum security prison he still appears to have been able to smug a mobile phone into his cell

Last year The Daily Record revealed he had been caught with a £200 Blackberry smartphone when guards at Saughton jail in Edinburgh opened his cell door and found him in the middle of a call.

Two years before that it emerged that along with his accomplices, Richard Cosgrove and Ben Young, they had been updating their Facebook pages while inside three different prisons. 

A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said he could not comment on individual prisoners.

He added: 'Possession of a mobile phone in prison is a criminal offence and we have measures in place to tackle this problem.'

According to the Prisons (Interference with Wireless Telegraphy) Act 2012 it is a disciplinary offence to possess a mobile phone within a prison and smuggling a phone inside can carry a sentence of up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine.
