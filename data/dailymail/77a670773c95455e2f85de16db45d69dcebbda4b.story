Tragic: Maureen Stone, 72, died after she was brutally assaulted with a curtain pole at a care home in Trentham, Staffordshire, an inquest heard

A grandmother died 13 days after being viciously attacked with a curtain pole by a fellow care home resident, an inquest has heard.

Maureen Shone, 72, was found by staff on the floor of her bedroom in Trentham, Staffordshire after being brutally assaulted by a male patient.

The helpless dementia sufferer was found covered in bruises Selwyn House, and the metal pole used to beat her was found dangling by her bed, covered in blood.

The inquest at North Staffordshire Coroner's Court heard she had been put to bed early that evening.

But it emerged a sensor â€“ placed under Mrs Shone's mattress to alert staff if she got out of bed â€“ had not been switched on by staff.

Carers then found her lying on the floor two hours later after hearing a banging noise coming from her room.

Rebecca Gittings, the manager of the unit where Mrs Shone was staying, told the hearing: 'I was walking up the corridor to give another patient some medicine when I heard a faint banging noise coming from Maureen's room.

'I went in to check if everything was all right and once I got inside I saw that her room was completely trashed.

'There were pictures all over the floor, her bedding was everywhere and the curtains had been pulled down. Maureen was banging her head on the floor.'

Care assistant Azyeb Haile ran to Mrs Gittings after hearing her shout for assistance.

Miss Haile said: 'I saw Maureen, she was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere.

'Her room was messy and there were things broken on the floor. The curtain pole was pulled down and had blood on it. I went out of the room and saw a male patient standing outside.

Home: She was found covered in blood on the floor of Selwyn House. She died 13 days after returning from hospital

'I checked him over and saw that his hands, trousers and shoes were covered in blood. There was nobody else around so I spoke to the man and asked him what he had done but he was shouting about his wife.'

Mrs Shone was transferred to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where doctors found she had severe facial injuries, a cut lip and a possible rib fracture.

She was kept in for 48 hours before being allowed to return to the Guardian Care-run home.

Although Mrs Shone returned to the home two days later she died on November 5 after collapsing.

Post mortem results recorded that Mrs Shone died of pneumonia, aggravated by dementia and blunt force trauma.

Treatment: Mrs Shone was taken to The University Hospital of North Staffordshire and was there for two days

Mrs Shone's daughter, Patricia Shone, went to the hospital after being called by staff .

Miss Shone, 52, from Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'Given that I had quite a few phone calls about her falling over I wasn't unduly concerned, so I went to the hospital the following day.

'But when I saw my mum I had a bit of a shock. She looked like she had been in a boxing match.

'She was bruised all over her face and chest, her nose was bent, her eyes were black and she was barely recognisable.

The inquest at North Staffordshire Coroner's Court heard she had been put to bed early that evening

'I was horrified to learn from a member of hospital staff that my mum had been beaten with a metal pole.

'I wasn't best pleased because she should have been asleep in what should have been a safe environment.'

North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith is due to deliver his ruling on the case on March 27.
