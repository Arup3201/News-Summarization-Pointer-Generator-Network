A church-going mother who was accused of trolling Madeleine McCann’s parents has been found dead in a hotel room.

Brenda Leyland, 63, was found dead at a Marriott hotel on Saturday around 15 miles from her immaculately kept village home.

Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious.

Divorcee Mrs Leyland had been identified as one of a number of online ‘trolls’ posting a series of abusive comments about Kate and Gerry McCann, by Sky News last Thursday.

She told a reporter who confronted her that she had been ‘entitled’ to make the comments using her Twitter identity @Sweepyface.  

Yesterday, her son, Ben, 20, who is said to be studying law in Los Angeles, posted the following brief tribute: ‘I love you mum and I will miss you forever’. His friends then began passing on their condolences on the site.

Last night, neighbours of Mrs Leyland, who had continued using her married name, told of their shock at her death.

One said: ‘Brenda kept herself very much to herself, but people were surprised when she was accused of trolling the McCanns. You don’t expect something that like around here. It’s a very quiet place.

‘But the village will be shocked by this news. I’m sure no-one would have expected her to do something like this. People didn’t condone what she is said to have done, but it is obviously very sad when anybody is found dead.’ 

Burton Overy was mentioned in the Domesday Book and is just 15 miles from the McCanns’ home in Rothley, Leicestershire.

Mrs Leyland, who was educated at a convent school and studied at Goldsmiths, University of London, is among a group of hate-filled critics of Kate and Gerry McCann who have posted hundreds of vile messages about the couple online.

The trollers wrongly believe the McCanns were involved in their daughter’s disappearance.

Among the many comments attributed to Mrs Leyland on Twitter was one that said: ‘Q ‘how long must the Mccanns suffer’ answer ‘for the rest of their miserable lives’.’

On Friday, the day after her interview was broadcast, she disappeared from her home Leicestershire, neighbours said. 

Sky News said today in a statement: 'We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time.'

Last week the father of Madeleine McCann called for an example to be made of ‘vile’ internet trolls who have been targeting the family.

Gerry McCann said he had ‘grave concerns’ about letting his nine-year-old twins use the internet after threats of violence and kidnapping.

The comments, in an interview with the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, came after it emerged that police are looking at a dossier of abuse posted on Twitter, Facebook and chat forums.

Mr McCann, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Praia da Luz in 2007, said he and wife Kate did not read such material because it was too 'upsetting'.

Mr McCann said. ‘Clearly something needs to be done about the abuse on the internet. I’m glad to say that there have been a number of people where police have taken action.

‘I think we probably need more people charged.’

Asked about ‘@sweepyface’, Mr McCann said: 'I haven’t read her tweets ... I think that is an issue, that our behaviour is modified by this.

‘We do not have any significant presence on social media or online. And I’ve got grave concerns about our children as they grow up and start to access the internet in an unsupervised capacity.

‘There have been other instances where people are threatening to kidnap our children. People are threatening violence against Kate and myself.

‘Of course it’s not just us - it is many other people who happen to find themselves in rather tragic circumstances.

‘I’m glad to see the law around this area is being reviewed. But I do think we need to make examples of people who are causing damage.’

The troll investigation featured in numerous newspapers including The Guardian, The Independent, The Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Daily Star, The Daily Express as well as the Daily Mail after Sky News exposed her identity as one of the trolls who targeted the McCanns.

Scotland Yard is currently investigating the posting online of hundreds of hate messages aimed at the McCanns, both aged 46, whose daughter disappeared during a family holiday to Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2007

A Leicestershire Police spokeswoman said: ‘Police were called at 1.42pm on Saturday 4 October to reports of a body of a woman in a hotel room in Smith Way, Grove Park, Leicester.

‘Officers have attended the scene and a file is being prepared for the coroner. Identification of the deceased is a matter of the coroner. The death is not being treated as suspicious.’ 

McCann spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: ‘Kate and Gerry will not be saying anything. It is entirely a matter for the police.’

A spokesman for the Marriott hotel said he had nothing to add beyond the police statement.

Using the Twitter handle @sweepyface, Mrs Leyland posted dozens of messages attacking the McCann family

Detectives have decided to act after being given a dossier from McCann family supporters which catalogues the abusive remarks - including death threats - aimed at the couple on Twitter, Facebook and online forums.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman last week confirmed officers were assessing the contents of ‘documentation’ which has been passed to officers and were consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service and the McCanns.

Last night, a spokesman for Marriott Hotels International Ltd said: ‘We are very sad to confirm the death of a guest at the Leicester Marriott Hotel and our thoughts go out to the family and friends of the deceased. As this is a police matter and an investigation is underway, we are unable to comment further and enquiries should be directed to the police.’
