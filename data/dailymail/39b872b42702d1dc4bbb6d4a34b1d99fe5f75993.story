Carbon dioxide levels have reached its highest throughout human history, recent figures from a US monitoring station show.

The level in our atmosphere is now at a record high 400 parts per million, prompting renewed warnings of the ‘huge risks’ of climate change.

The shocking figures, which have risen from 270ppm before the Industrial Revolution, is a result of 
human activity such as burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.

Danger: Carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere is now at a record high 400 parts per million, and now experts warn of the risks of climate change

The preliminary figures have come  from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) monitoring station in Hawaii.

The greenhouse gas has not been at such high levels for around three million years.

The prehistoric climate had anaverage temperatures were 2C-3C higher and sea levels were around 20 metres above what they are today, Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at London School of Economics, said.

‘We are creating a prehistoric climate in which human societies will face huge and potentially catastrophic risks.

‘Only by urgently reducing global emissions will we be able to bring carbon dioxide levels down and avoid the full consequences of turning back the climate clock by three million years,’ he said.

Big change: The extreme rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere began before the Industrial Revolution mid-18th century

Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said: ‘Our common future is now bound up with this one simple measurement, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, and it now stands well above what some of our greatest scientific minds say is safe.

‘The implications are grave, we're facing major adverse planetary changes, our seasons are shifting faster than we thought possible, but even now there is still cause for hope.

‘Last year China installed more pollution-free renewable energy than coal, and it was the same in the USA. The tools exist to halt the relentless loading of our atmosphere with heat-trapping gases, all we need to do is tap the ingenuity of humankind to deploy them.’

And David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: ‘The milestone we've just reached is a reminder that we are heading in the wrong direction in terms of dealing with climate change.

‘It challenges us all to come to terms with the fact that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground and that, instead, we need to switch to renewable alternatives if we want to avoid dangerous climate change in the future.’
