'Monster': Convicted child killer Osvaldo Rivera, 34, Osvaldo Rivera, 34, has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 2-year-old boy

A southern New Jersey man who is in prison for killing a 6-year-old boy has admitted sexually assaulting a 2-year-old in a separate case.

Osvaldo Rivera, 34, pleaded guilty to sexual assault Monday.

Under terms of the plea deal, Rivera faces 15 years in prison to be served concurrently with the 110-year sentence he is already facing after a jury found him guilty of the murder of 6-year-old Dominick Andujar and the sexual assault of that boy's 12-year-old sister, Amber in September 2012. 

The sexual assault of the younger child, a 2-year-old boy, was the month before that.

The Camden County Prosecutor's Office said DNA evidence submitted to a state database helped link Rivera to the crime.

Rivera is scheduled to be sentenced in the toddler assault case April 17. 

'Rivera had to be held accountable for the crime he committed against this toddler, regardless of having been previously sentenced to life in prison in another case,' Assistant Prosecutor Christine Shah told Philadelphia Inquirer. 

In July 2014, a Camden jury found Osvaldo Rivera guilty of the murder of Dominick Andujar, as well as charges of attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault, burglary and weapons violations.

At around midnight on September 2, 2012, Rivera broke into the Andujar family's home in Camden and attacked then 12-year-old Amber Andujar as she slept on the couch.

Amber began to scream, which awoke 6-year-old Dominick - and he rushed to his sister's aid.

The small boy fought with the attacker and managed to free his sister in the process.

Amber, who was bleeding after being slashed in the throat by Rivera, ran to a neighbor's home to call for help.

By the time police arrived on the scene, the brave 6-year-old boy was dead after having his throat slashed.

Rivera fled the house after killing Dominick, and Amber was later seen running through the neighborhood, screaming for help while bleeding profusely from the throat.

Emergency responders said the cuts were so deep they could see Amber's vocal cords.

She later helped officers locate her rapist by telling them he was known by the nickname ’Popeye’ and lived in a Camden apartment. Police tracked him down to an apartment in the city and found him hiding between an upturned mattress and the wall.

According to investigators, during his questioning Rivera had revealed that he had smoked 'wet,' a combination of marijuana and PCP, prior to the killing.

During Rivera's sentencing last December, a defiant Amber Andujar declared: 'Today I stand here as a survivor. Even though he took a part of me away, in the end, you did not win.'
