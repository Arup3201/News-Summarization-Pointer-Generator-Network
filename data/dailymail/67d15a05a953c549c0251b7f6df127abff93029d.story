My knees ache, my legs are in a tangle, and every inch of my untoned body feels as if it has been put through a vigorous exercise routine. I am a shadow of my usual self — which for the past hour is literally what I have been.

I have been practising with the shadow dancers from Attraction, the troupe whose stunningly clever silhouettes have made them the bookies’ favourite at odds of 11/10 to win this year’s Britain’s Got Talent.

Thirteen million viewers watched them storm through their audition on the first night of the current series and many were left, like Amanda Holden, in tears at their poignant act.

Casting shadows: Lisa (left) recreates the mother and baby scene against a London backdrop

Set against a backdrop of familiar British landmarks — created by the carefully contorted bodies of the shadow dancers — it began with a couple meeting, marrying and having a baby, all seen on a screen lit from behind.

But the tale turned darker than its shadows when the soldier husband is killed in Afghanistan and the dancers turned themselves into a camel, palm trees, an enemy sniper and, finally, a cemetery.

It’s all down to firmly shaped bodies and exact positioning, explains Attraction’s founder and choreographer Zoltan Szucs.

He uses a simple back light to project shadows of the dancers’ bodies on to the screen to form seemingly impossible images and scenery in an emotional storyboard set to music. 

The performance stunned the judges and brought the panel and entire theatre audience to its feet. In the past month, Attraction’s audition has captured a further 17 million hits on YouTube.

Which is why I find myself firmly contained in an unforgiving Lycra unitard, nervously waiting to rehearse with the now world-famous Hungarian troupe who have flown into London early so I can join them for a practice session before their appearance in this week’s live semi-finals, and see exactly how it’s done.  

‘A mere millimetre out of place can change an entire shape. It’s all down to the distance between the light and the screen, which can shrink or magnify a body,’ says Zoltan.

I soon discover what he means as I watch the team re-enact the story that has captured the nation. Then I am asked to recreate the scenes taking the part of the young wife and mother who is widowed after her husband flies to Afghanistan.

We start at Tower Bridge — created by three rows of dancers — and I am linked with dancer Csba to create the shadow of the couple holding hands. My arms have to remain still and twisted otherwise they create a grotesque Beauty and the Beast image, with me as the Beast.

Creating the shadow is all about precision and aligning with the beam of light from the projector, which is important when I portray the bride in the London taxi scene, passing the Gherkin and the London Eye.

I have to kneel while stretching and straining both forwards and upwards to have any hope of getting my shadow anywhere near that of my taller bridegroom Csba.

But although my knees are feeling the pain, I have to keep still and smile to create the harmony between music, visual performance and body control. ‘I choose the song first and after I create the dance,’ says Zoltan.

In this case the song chosen is Emeli Sande’s Read All About It and before I know it it’s time for me to start a family, and  I am gently handed a doll while other dancers twist themselves to create the image of a pram standing in front of Big Ben.

‘This is Sam,’ says Zoltan. ‘Treat him tenderly. Look and smile at him and hold him like a real baby, supporting his neck.’

Rocking Sam up and down, while tucking in his toes to keep the line of the shadow smooth, lifting his hand with my fingers and smiling at him to show real emotion is hard when all I can think is one false move against the projector will make me look like a still-expectant mother.

Sam and I are the only ones allowed to sport free-flowing hair, while the other dancers must wear swimming caps to keep their shadow lines smooth.

As I look down there is one dancer on the floor below me who is creating the pram hood shadow, curving her arm around her head while balancing on the backs of two men who form the wheels.

My strength is failing as I wobble while trying to balance Sam and hold the position. My husband leaves for Afghanistan, and I go from dutiful wife and mother to acting out the local scenery.

Zoltan bends me into the palm tree position, angling my arms to create the arched branch. And with one twist of the head, my arm is magnified from a branch to a chunky tree trunk, while my fingers morph from delicate palm leaf fronds to fat lily pads.

There is laughter from the camel and from the other dancers viewing the shadow in front of the screen. Zoltan bends me back into shape, lifting my arm high to resemble a spout while pushing my nose into my armpit.

All the shapes such as this palm tree and camel are creating by contorting the bodies of the dancers

Holding the pose is agony and I can feel my head slowly drooping towards the floor. ‘Keep your head up — it is supposed to represent a coconut,’ says Zoltan.

No body part can be allowed to stray, otherwise the entire shadow collapses. This is why the eight dancers have to train 11 hours nearly every day, perfecting their flexibility as well as concentration.

‘This is very hard work — you need physical and mental stamina and that’s why we practice long hours to achieve it,’ warns Zoltan.

‘Accidents can easily happen when we’re standing on each others’ backs. We have daily physiotherapy and sports massages to prevent injuries.’

Shadow dancing has its origins in China, some 300 years ago.

Zoltan, 40, an award-winning breakdancer, founded Attraction in 2004 as part of Hungary’s Black Lights Theatre group. He runs it with his wife Eva, who is the troupe’s manager — as well as mother to the couple’s two sons.

The key to keeping the shapes is down to team work, says  Eva, 39. ‘We tell our dancers there is no room for  ego because the connection to others is vital. This group has been together for three years. But if we bring in someone new, everyone has to decide if they fit in. If not, they’re told to go.’

Attraction tackle poignant subject matter in their shadow act

Eva, whose sons are aged ten and seven, takes care of all the dancers’ needs. ‘This is our second family. I am like a mother to the dancers who are mostly in their teens and early 20s.’

They had taken part in the Hungarian and German shows based on Britain’s Got Talent doing their normal Black Lights Theatre act — where the illusions required a completely dark theatre, ultraviolet lighting and fluorescent costumes.

At one moment, performers were invisible; in the next, they appeared to be floating in the air — but made little impact. So Zoltan changed tack with shadow dancing, debuting as guest performers on Hungary’s Dancing With The Stars in 2008.

When they learned Britain’s Got Talent was open to European acts they sent a video of their performance to the show’s producers and were invited to audition in Birmingham. It proved to be the international breakthrough they were waiting for — and the troupe are determined to capitalise on it.      

In their rehearsal studio, Attraction usually create their shadows with just one lamp and no projector.

Zoltan says: ‘It keeps costs down, but for Britain’s Got Talent we have rented a projector. Every time we use a projector, we have to customise all the shapes and distances as each one creates a different effect. So we have to spend time working out the perfect position to ensure it throws all the shadows precisely.’

When the troupe learned the show was open to European acts they sent an audition tape to the UK

Thousands of tiny fluorescent stickers are dotted over the soft dance mat, each colour representing the foot and hand positioning for each shadow for every dancer.

Although all the performers are a mix of ballet, modern, hip-hop and street dancers, Zoltan says the moves are easy for the troupe to master. ‘The real work is having the core strength to hold the shapes and also to work with the projector with precision,’ he says.

The hardest shadow for the troupe is their ‘big face’. Everyone is needed for this shape but I am spared the indignity of piggybacking and bending into someone’s bottom to create a chin. Instead, I wiggle my fingers to create fluttering eyelashes.

Zoltan says: ‘We can create bigger shapes with more people but we are only eight and have no reserves, so we have to be very careful no one gets injured, because having got this far on Britain’s Got Talent, it would be a huge disappointment if our performance was spoiled.’

There have been complaints on Twitter that European artists are being allowed to compete in a British show. But they have Simon Cowell’s support. He says: ‘We are part of Europe; it’s flattering they fly all this way to enter the show. It means our Brits have got to step up.’

Attraction’s ultimate dream is to win and perform for The Queen.

‘We hope we are popular and would like to go through to the final as we want to thank the British people. But we are also realistic. The most important thing to us is that we feel we’ve already won because Britain’s Got Talent has put Attraction on the worldwide map,’ says Eva.
