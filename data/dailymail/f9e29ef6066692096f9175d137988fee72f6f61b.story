A missing dog has been found after a plea for help by his owners went viral on the internet attracting the attention of Hollywood stars and raising £1,000 to fund a helicopter to help in the search.

Owners Lewis Blythe and Gary Lee have been reunited with Murphy after the boxer slipped his lead and ran off while on a walking holiday in the Lake District.

Mr Blythe, 29, said his pet pooch bolted after spotting a herd of sheep close to Lake Windermere in Cumbria.

The headstrong dog managed to wriggle free of his lead before sprinting off and disappearing.

Mr Blythe called Patterdale Mountain Rescue and spent five days scouring the area in a desperate hunt for Murphy, but found no trace of the one-year-old.

But after posting Murphy's details on to the Notts and Yorkshire Boxer Rescue Facebook page, his plea for help went viral.

Donations began to flood in, as people touched by his story, offered to help.

Celebrities including Hollywood A-lister Jessica Biel, who is married to Justin Timberlake, BBC presenter Claire Balding and Rugby star and husband of Zara Philips, Mike Tindall re-tweeted Mr Blythe's call for help on Twitter.

He said he was shocked when £1,000 was raised, allowing him to hire a helicopter and pilot for a day, to search the area from the sky.

Mr Blythe said: 'We flew over the area and on the third passing we saw him lying down in some grass.

'He looked up at us, he sat up, but he stayed there.

'Then we landed in a field below. I got him in my arms and held him. It was an amazing feeling, but nothing sank in until much later on.'

Murphy, who was finally found on Saturday, has lost five kilos but otherwise remains unscathed by his ordeal.

Donations: Members of the public helped Mr Blythe and Mr Lee raise around £1,000 to help find Murphy. They charted this helicopter, to take a bird's eye view of the search area. On their third flight over the spot where he was last seen they caught sight of their boxer, lying in some grass

Mr Blythe, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, added: 'Murphy is a very silly dog. He is always chasing things. He is very lively, and has a lovely spirit.

'I am delighted to have him home. I had almost lost hope.'

He thanked Notts and Yorkshire Boxer Rescue and Patterdale Mountain Rescue for their help in finding Murphy.

A spokesperson for the Patterdale team said: 'The 999 call came through on a roaming emergency system and the team were therefore unable to re-contact the man.

'With very little information to go on, and not knowing if the caller and dog were stuck in a dangerous situation on the mountain, the team went quickly to their aid.

'On route the team heard from a member of the public that the dog and owner and had been airlifted by private helicopter and were safely on their way to the Lancaster area.

'The dog had actually gone missing on Monday afternoon and team members had assisted the man to search for the dog each day since then.

'We are very pleased that the outcome was so positive for Murphy, who was found fit and well.'

Home sweet home: Murphy is now safely back at the couple's home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He is around five kilos lighter than when he disappeared but is otherwise unscathed by his ordeal
