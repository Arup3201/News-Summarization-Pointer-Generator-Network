She may be head of state but the Queen, it seems, is as impatient as any excited great-grandmother-to-be.

Speaking for the entire nation yesterday, she urged the Duchess of Cambridge’s baby to ‘hurry up’.

And she revealed she was keen for a quick arrival because ‘I’m going on holiday soon’.

Watch video of the comments below...

Thrilled: Fay Batey is the bold schoolgirl who asked the Queen the frank question: 'Would you like the baby to be a boy or a girl?' To which the Queen, pictured smiling in Cumbria today, admitted she would like the royal baby to 'hurry up' before she goes off on holiday to Balmoral

Magic moment: Fay Batey, 10, (with her back to the camera) asks the 
Queen her question - whether she would like the Royal baby to be a boy or a
 girl

The 87-year-old, who will leave 
Buckingham Palace next week to spend the summer at Balmoral in Scotland,
 made her unprecedented off-the-cuff comments on a trip to Lake 
Windermere in Cumbria.

During a walkabout she met 
ten-year-old schoolgirl Fay Batey, who summoned up the courage to ask 
her: ‘Do you want Kate’s baby to be a boy or a girl?’

The Queen replied instantly: ‘I don’t think I mind.’

Then, after a short pause, she said: 
‘I would very much like it to arrive because I’m going on holiday 
soon... I wish it would hurry up.’

Turning to move on, she added with a laugh: ‘No sign yet!’

Her comment to Fay, a pupil at Wiggonby CofE School, near Wigton, Cumbria, drew laughter from the watching crowds.

But it will have done nothing to cheer
 the dozens of reporters and camera crews gathered outside the Lindo 
Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London, who have been 
waiting for up to two weeks in blistering heat for the baby to arrive.

Delighted: Fay said she felt excited but a bit nervous before asking the question. She said she thought the Queen was 'really pretty'

Visit: Queen Elizabeth II talks to school children from Wiggonby Church of England School, and one of their pupils asked about the future king or queen

Anticipation: Press have been camped outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, for days waiting for the arrival of the royal baby

Kensington Palace has always refused 
to reveal the duchess’s due date, although Kate let slip during an 
engagement earlier this year that the future third in line to the throne
 was expected in ‘mid July’.

Early reports had suggested July 13 or 15 as the likely date, but these have come and gone without incident.

Kate is now overdue. This will be of 
little concern to her doctors, however, who are unlikely to consider 
inducing labour until she is at least a week overdue.

For the time being she and her 
temporarily off-duty husband Prince William are staying with her 
parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, at their £4.8million mansion in 
Berkshire to escape the city heat.

Majestic: The Queen walks with businessman Bill Bewley on the bank of Lake Windermere in the sunny Lake District today

On board: Her majesty stood on the deck of the Teal Windermere Lake Cruise ship, at Bowness in Cumbria today

Attire: The Queen was wearing a Stewart Parvin outfit of a green and blue with a hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan, while her daughter Anne wore bright yellow

Aides are confident that even if the 
duchess’s contractions start while she is in the country, they can get 
her into London with a police escort in less than an hour.

Speaking about her encounter with the 
Queen yesterday, Fay said: ‘We were talking about it on the journey down
 and it [the baby] was the question everybody wanted to know. So I 
decided to ask.

‘When I saw the Queen approaching, I felt excited but a bit nervous. She was really pretty.

‘I thought the Queen’s reply was a good one. After all, she wouldn’t want to have a baby while she was on holiday.’

Her sister Ella, 11, said: ‘The Queen had a really friendly atmosphere around her. She was very polite and kind.’

Mystery: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do not know if they are having a boy or a girl, which is now believed to be overdue

The girls have been learning about the
 Royal Family at school, where teachers have taught them about the 
significance of the royal baby, who may be the first female heir in 
history to automatically succeed to the throne by right.

Fay and Ella live in Wigton with their
 seven-year-old brother and their parents Lynne, 38, who is about to 
take over the family post office business, and Steven, 40, who owns a 
mechanical company.

Mrs Batey said last night: ‘We are all
 delighted about Fay and Ella meeting the Queen. They have been giddy 
with excitement all week.

‘We discussed it the night before, and we asked the girls what they would say if they had the chance to meet the Queen.

‘Fay did say that she would like to 
know if the Queen would prefer the child to be a boy or a girl. But it 
was very much a jokey conversation, we didn’t think for one minute that 
she would come into such close proximity.’

Having fun: An animated Queen to local residents as she travels on the Teal cruise boat on a glorious day in Cumbria

The royal party also went on a brief walkabout during the 20-minute visit. The Queen was said to be thrilled when presented with a bottle of damson gin saying she would be 'keeping that for herself'
