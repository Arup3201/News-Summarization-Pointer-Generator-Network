While Google can’t answer what happens to you when you die, it’s trying to account for what happens to your online persona.

The search engine giant has released its ‘Inactive Account’ settings page, which allows a Google user to clarify what they want done with their YouTube, Gmail, and Google+ accounts after they die or are otherwise unable to use their account.

Users can choose to have their data deleted after three, six, or twelve months of inactivity.

To the cloud: Google has introduced its 'Inactive Account Manager' tool that allows users to chose when to delete their data from Gmail, Blogger, and other Google accounts

Google product manager Andreas Tuerk wrote in an accompanying public policy blog post that it is important to plan for the worst.

‘Not many of us like thinking about death – especially our own,’ he writes. ‘But making plans for what happens after you’re gone is really important for the people you leave behind.’

He acknowledged the name, ‘Inactive Account Manager,’ is ‘not a great’ one; some techies have already colloquially named it the ‘Death Account Manager.’

In the post, Tuerk explains how Google users can implement the service. First, they select how long their account is inactive – up to a year – before all of their data is deleted.

Google will also issue a warning a month before data in one’s account is deleted. For most people, the service comes as welcome, if not somber, news, as it provides a buffer for information from emails, Gchats, phone calls, and blog posts to stay out of the wrong hands.

Similarly, users can pick and choose which services they want to send to other people, from Blogger, to YouTube, Picasa Web Albums, and contacts. Passwords will not be passed on to loved ones.

Protected: Data from Google services like GMail, Google+, Blogger, and Picasa can be programed to be deleted after a set time of inactivity

A spokesman for Google told TechCrunch that in a conflicting situation – say, when a family member or interested person wanted to look at the Google account of the deceased, the company ‘will honor the preference you’ve made in Inactive Account Manager to the extent permitted by the law.’

As a policy, Facebook does not give out passwords of users in the event that person died. Rather, accounts are ‘memorialized,’ meaning that only confirmed friends can view their profile information.

Commenters on the public policy blog gave a largely positive response to the service.

One user wrote: ‘I always thought about this… And Google has the solution ready. Keep coming (up with) such great tools.’

Another commenter cheekily wrote: ‘Love this. Can you let me post from the grave as well?’
