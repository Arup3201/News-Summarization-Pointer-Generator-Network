This is the moment a car worth more than the average UK house price was pulled over by police before being towed away.

The driver of the £270,000 Lamborghini Aventador was asked to stop in London's Knightsbridge last night by officers wanting to see his papers.

After the man was unable to produce documents that satisfied them the supercar was properly insured, he then had to watch as it was loaded onto a tow truck and taken away.

Not so fast: This is the moment the driver of a Lamborghini Aventador was pulled over in London by police

Police officers asked the man to provide insurance documents for the £300,000 supercar in Basil Street

A crowd gathered in Basil Street, just behind Harrods, to watch as the sports car, which boasts upwards-opening scissor doors, was taken away by police.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'A Lamborghini Aventador was seized yesterday from Basil Street, SW1, just before 8pm for being driven without insurance.

'No arrests have been made and the vehicle currently remains at a police car pound.'

The car was seized as part of the Met Police's Operation Cubo crackdown on uninsured vehicles.  So far more than 10,000 cars have been towed under Cubo, many of them old bangers.

But a police spokesman said: 'We've had a few Porsches, BMW X5s and a Ferrari - that one got crushed, and in fact the majority of them are.'

This was not the first Lamborghini Aventador to be towed under the crackdown - a purple model was towed, also from Knightsbridge, last month after police found he was not properly insured.

Off to the pound: Police say the luxury car is not the first Lamborghini Aventador they have seized

Last month police working under Operation Cubo seized a purple Lamborghini Aventador in Wilton Place, also in Knightsbridge, after its driver failed to produce correct insurance documents, and warned it could be crushed.
