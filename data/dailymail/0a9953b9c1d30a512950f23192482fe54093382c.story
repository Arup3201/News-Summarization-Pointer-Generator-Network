Prince Harry could move into a huge apartment at Kensington Palace next to his brother and sister-in-law, it has been claimed.

Princess Michael of Kent - who lives next door to William and Kate at the Central London palace - said Harry could move into the home currently occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge moved into an apartment at the palace last year that had been left vacant following the death of Princess Margaret in 2002.

However, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said there were ‘no plans’ for 29-year-old Harry to move from his one-bedroom flat in Kensington Palace, reported The Sunday Times.

Princess Michael told Tatler magazine that William and Kate have a ‘lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.

She added: ‘They're rattling around this huge space and I think Prince Harry might go there, then they'd be next door to each other - very good move.’

Harry left his old room at Clarence House in March 2012 for a modest former staff apartment at Kensington Palace, reported The Sunday Times.

Last October, Princess Michael - nicknamed Princess Pushy for her highhanded manner - recalled the moment when she was told she would have to sell her £5.7million 16th century mansion, Nether Lypiatt, in Gloucestershire.

She and her husband Prince Michael sold the house in 2006 to meet the £120,000-a-year rent on their five-bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace, after being told they could no longer pay a subsidised 'peppercorn rent' of just £69-a-week.

She told The Sunday Times at the time: 'For the first time that terrible word came into my life when our private secretary said, "Ma'am, you have to downsize." It was the worst word I'd heard in ages.'
