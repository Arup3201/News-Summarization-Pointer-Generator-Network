Mesut Ozil could make his long-awaited return against Stoke City on Sunday, with Arsene Wenger admitting Arsenal have missed his creative talents this season.

The German playmaker, a £42.5million signing from Real Madrid in 2013, was ruled out for three months with a knee injury after picking up an injury against Chelsea in October.

But it seems Ozil is now raring to go having been involved in full training sessions once again, and he even revealed his anticipation on social media.

Mesut Ozil will be in the Arsenal squad against Stoke this Sunday... here he poses with kit man Vic Akers

Ozil, pictured against Besiktas, hasn't featured for the injury-hit Gunners since October

He posted a picture with Arsenal kit man Vic Akers, with the message: 'Vic, just don't forget to put my shirt back in the dressing room on Sunday!????'

The Gunners were stretched for numbers over the Christmas period, with Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla having to play every game, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's fitness was also tested.

But Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini could join Ozil in returning this weekend, along with Olivier Giroud who was suspended.

Wenger believes Ozil can give Arsenal a new imputus as they look to a secure another top-four finish.

Arsene Wenger says the German international is 'an exceptional football player'

'He is an exceptional football player,' the Arsenal manager said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. 'He always gives you continuity in your game. He's a very creative player and ideally you want all your best players available.

'The advantage of these players - for example Giroud, Koscielny, Debuchy, Ozil - at the moment where most of the players in the league have played 26 or 27 games in their legs, they have four or five.

'If we can get them ready and fresh and competitive, it can give us a new [impetus].' 

Speaking to Arsenal.com about Ozil, Wenger said: 'He is ready. What he is is hungry. They come back from the World Cup and when you come back having won the World Cup, even if I gave them the holiday they needed, the hunger is a bit artificial.

'You have to be frustrated from competition and slowly get back to realise how much you miss it to come back to normal. I had that before with former players.

'Today he looks hungry - he worked extremely hard to come back. He really pushed himself to the limit of what you can absorb physically.'
