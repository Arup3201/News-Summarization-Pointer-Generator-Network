The selfie craze has hit the Tour de France. But riders have warned that spectators could get seriously hurt if they step into the road to grab these pictures when they have their backs to the fast-moving peloton. 

Tejay van Garderen branded the craze ‘a dangerous mix of vanity and stupidity’ and appeared to be complaining on Twitter on Sunday night that he suffered a knee injury after a collision with a spectator.

‘Standing in the middle of the road with your back turned while 200 cyclists come at you, just to take a selfie. Think,’ said the American.

Support: Millions of fans lined the route as the tour began in Yorkshire but a few caused trouble

Concern: Some of the cyclists are worried at how close the crowds got on the narrow roads

Anywhere will do: Fans climbed walls and some even camped out to get pictures of the race

‘I love the crowds and thank you for your support. But please give us room. Gonna ice my knee now.’

His views were echoed by Team Sky rider and British Olympic gold medallist, Geraint Thomas.

‘It was dodgy at times,’ he said. ‘The worst thing is when people have got their backs to the peloton taking selfies.

‘Do that if you want but go sit in a tree. It’s the new pain in the a**e that’s for sure. People don’t understand how fast we go.’ Sir Dave Brailsford agreed.

‘British people are fantastic at supporting sport,’ he said. ‘But the riders were worried about safety.’
