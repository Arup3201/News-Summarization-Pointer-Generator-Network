Answers? A source has told authorities in Pennsylvania and the FBI that he knows the location of missing DA Ray Gricar's body

One of the most shocking things about the Penn State sex abuse scandal when it came to light in 2011, was the fact that the local District Attorney knew about the case back in the 1990s.

The mother of one of the children abused by football coach Jerry Sandusky, reported the crime to DA Ray Gricar in 1998 but he decided not to bring up charges.

Gricar, 59, was never able to explain why he let Sandusky slip away, since Gricar himself vanished in 2005.

After the sex scandal revelation, some hypothesized that Gricar's disappearance was somehow tied to Penn State.  

But now a former person of interest in his disappearance has told the Altoona Mirror that it was a former Hell's Angel that carried out the killing and had nothing to do with Penn State.

The last time anyone saw Gricar was on April 15, 2005, when he left for work in his red mini cooper.

Gricar never showed up and the next day his car was discovered parked in an antique mall parking lot. Eventually, authorities also found his computer and hard drive.

Over the years the FBI has worked with local police to investigate leads in the case..

Last May, a former Hell's Angels ranking officer decided to come forward to authorities and the Altoona Mirror with what he says is the real story behind Gricar's death.

Sex abuse scandal: After the Penn State sex abuse scandal came to light in 2011, it was revealed that Gricar heard complaints about football coach Jerry Sandusky as early as 1998 but decided not to bring up charges

Without a trace: Gricar was never able to account for why he let Sandusky, above, off since he himself went missing while driving to work in April 2005

According to the source, Gricar was murdered by a former Hell's Angel who was getting back at the DA for receiving a long prison sentence for an aggravated assault conviction in the 1990s.

The man who carried out the killing was also an FBI informant. According to a  statement read by a judge at a sentencing hearing, the former Hell's Angel reported information to the FBI on illegal activities by the motorcycle gang after his release.

The source says he decided to come forward with the information on Gricar's death to clear himself and because he believed the former Hell's Angel responsible was dead.

He has since learned that the Hell's Angel is actually still alive and living in another state.

Revenge: The latest lead comes from a former ranking officer with the Hell's Angels (above, unrelated file photo) who says it was a former member who killed Gricar out of revenge for a long prison sentence

He also said speculation that Gricar's disappearance had something to do with the Jerry Sandusky scandal was 'especially annoying'.

According to Bellefonte police Detective Matthew Rickard, the investigation into Gricar's disappearance is 'ongoing' but both the FBI and local police have questioned the source.

The source took FBI agents to the location in Pennsylvania where he says Gricar's body was disposed of, but at the last minute wouldn't give the specific location since he wants to secure immunity first.

The shaft where Gricar is buried contains the body of four others as well as guns and he doesn't want to incriminate himself or others by opening it up.

The source says Gricar's body was hidden there after his 'knee caps were spun' and his throat was slit.

Murdered? According to the source, Gricar faced a gruesome end. He had his 'knee caps spun' and his throat slit. His body is allegedly buried in a shaft on a property in Pennsylvania

Since contacting the authorities and the paper, the source has hired a Harrisburg-based lawyer to represent him.

Gricar's family has been informed about the latest lead but aren't getting their hopes it that will give them any closure.

Gricar's nephew Tony Gricar says he takes all of the leads with a grain of salt. 

'We've heard pretty much all the theories that anyone's ever come up with,' he said.

Jerry Sandusky was convicted last year of child sex abuse but maintains his innocence.
