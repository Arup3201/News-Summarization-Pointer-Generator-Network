Portugal players arrived back home to a depressing welcome after a dismal World Cup, with no one even bothering to collect star player Cristiano Ronaldo from the airport.

The Portuguese fared only slightly better than England, claiming four points to finish third in a group containing Germany, USA and Ghana but still being eliminated before the business end of the tournament begins in Brazil.

Ronaldo also failed to live up to his billing as the best player on the planet - after struggling with injuries ahead of the tournament he returned to spend most of his games pouting petulantly at teammates before scoring his now customary single World Cup goal (in the final 2-1 victory against Ghana).

Although there were a handful of supporters waiting at Lisbon airport, the atmosphere was distinctly muted - especially for someone like Ronaldo who is used to being bathed in the limelight of adoring fans.

After bidding farewell to teammates including Nani, the current Ballon d'Or winner - sporting a shiner under his left eye - cut a disconsolate figure as he trudged towards a public taxi rank before throwing his bag in the boot like an average tourist and leaving alone.

Portugal players attempted to dismiss their lacklustre performance by trotting out some time honoured cliches associated with early exits.

'That's football, we are leaving our heads held high,' offered Ronaldo. 'We tried out best and we didn't succeed.'

Manchester United winger Nani was singing from the same hymn sheet when he said: 'Our aim was to leave with our heads held high.

'We couldn't afford to make the same mistakes again,' said defender Pepe, who was sent off against Germany and did not enlarge on what the mistakes were.

'We wanted to go through to the next stage, we tried our best but unfortunately, it wasn't possible. We fought hard but we didn't get there.'

Midfielder Joao Moutinho was the only player who offered any sort of insight when he complained about the heat in Manaus where Portugal drew with the United States.

'I was tired after 30 minutes, although I know that the conditions were the same for everyone, so it's not an excuse," he said.

Grounds for complaint? Joao Moutinho defended Portugal's decision to train in the USA

Moutinho also addressed the vexed issue of why Portugal had gone to train in the United States for 10 days before the World Cup, instead of preparing in Brazil.

'The conditions there were very similar to Campinas (Portugal's training camp in Brazil)," he said.

'People are asking questions about this now because things did not go well.'

But there was no suggestion that anything else had gone wrong.

'We have an excellent team who can beat any opponent, and two years ago we came within a whisker of reaching the Euro 2012 final. We musn't now throw everything away and say that we are the worst.'
