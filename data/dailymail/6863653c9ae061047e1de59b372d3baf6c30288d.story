It is known as the land of fire and ice and these pictures show how Iceland really does live up to its reputation.

Captured by Israeli photographer Erez Marom, these spectacular photos highlight the frozen beauty of Iceland's wintery landscapes as well as the dramatic eruptions that send molten lava flowing for miles.

The 34-year-old photographer snapped the images in the area around the Holuhraun volcano, which dramatically erupted in August this year and has been spewing 1,000 degree Centigrade lava ever since.

He also ventured into glaciers within the protected Vatnajökull National Park to capture close-up shots of smooth, blue-tinged ice caves as well as snapping a rare picture of tonnes of fish frozen stiff in a fjord. 

With his pictures, Mr Moran hoped to show the contrast between Iceland's 27 square-mile largest active lava field and the frozen glacial formations that surround it.

The landscape and wildlife photographer is so enchanted by Iceland's dramatic scenery, he offers tours to the country for those wanting to learn how to capture the glaciers, Northern Lights and volcanoes.

The 3,490 euro (£2,732) tours take in some of Iceland's most amazing scenery and untouched areas to capture killer whales, frozen waterfalls, playful seals and towering mountains.
