Barman Robbie Dale served a first-half double for non-league Blyth Spartans but their FA Cup of cheer ran dry as Birmingham’s Wesley Thomas called time on their remarkable run.

The 30-year-old Spartans skipper will be opening up The Blacksmiths Arms in Newcastle on Sunday morning as he returns to the day job he chose over a career as a professional footballer.

On this evidence, Dale would not be out of place in the Championship. There were certainly no half measures during a pulsating opening period in which Blyth – of the seventh-tier Northern Premier League and playing their seventh match in this season’s competition – took a deserved two-goal lead thanks to the devastating Dale in front of a sold out Croft Park.

The hosts emerged for the second half under instruction to ‘keep it tight for 15 minutes’. By the hour mark, however, they were trailing, such was the madness of this enthralling tie played on a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses at. It was, despite the narrow nature of the defeat for the underdogs, a magical afternoon.

Blyth boss Tom Wade was certainly proud of his side’s mammoth effort.

‘If you’d said before the game we’d get beaten 3-2 you might have taken that,’ he said.

‘I think we deserved to win it but they had 10 minutes of total dominance which killed it.

‘So I’m very proud of what they have done. This team has got a lot to give and the future is very bright.’

Dale, too, refused to bemoan the turnaround.

‘You get to 2-0 at half-time and you think the shock is on,’ he said. ‘The instruction at half-time was “keep it tight for 10 or 15 minutes” but that didn’ t work out did it?!

‘It was uphill after that really but in the last 20 minutes we came again. I had a half chance which went just wide and Danny (Parker) had a header which went into the side-netting. We might have nicked a replay.’

Blyth took the lead on 35 minutes when Jarret Rivers, scorer of the stoppage-time winner at Hartlepool in the second round, drove into the area. He outwitted himself and two defenders with a clumsy step-over attempt and took advantage to draw back for Dale who steamed in to smash home.

It was soon two. Dale, receiving a short free-kick from Stephen Turnbull, drifted, as he does, languidly into the area. But beneath his lethargy resides a lethal streak and the winger duly dropped a shoulder before locating the bottom corner.

And Dale, reflecting on his brace, said: ‘For the first one Jarrett did brilliantly to battle his way out of the corner and pull it back and the defender got his studs caught in the turf and I just ran on to it.

‘Then, for the second one, we’ve tried that a couple of times when Stephen doesn’t fancy crossing it and we work it short. I just had a run and the lad let me get inside. The shot was on and I took it.

‘It was incredible, the ground was bouncing and I was thinking, “I could get three here”. It wasn’t to be and they had a brilliant 10 minutes, but we can be proud of what we have done as a team. It’s been a brilliant run and we’ve been close to going out a few times.

‘It’s back to reality now, Frickley away on Tuesday night. First I’m opening up the pub in the morning but I’ll be out with my mates for a few beers tonight.’

The turning point in the contest perhaps arrived in first-half injurytime when Blyth’s livewire forward Daniel Maguire escaped in the area and took aim for the top corner only for Colin Doyle to extend an arm and flip over. Without that stop City’s confidence would have been irreversibly sapped.

As it was, they emerged for the second half determined to make amends for the embarrassment of the first. What followed was three goals in six minutes.

First it was Lee Novak who smashed into the bottom corner from the edge of the area on 52 minutes before Thomas out-muscled centre back Ryan Hutchinson and hammered beyond Peter Jeffries.

And Thomas capped the quick-fire turnaround when Mark Duffy swept over from the left and he rose to head in from six yards.

And Birmingham boss Gary Rowett, who made 10 changes for the game, said: ‘We learnt a bit more than we wanted to learn about some of the players at half-time.

‘I felt it was very important we scored early in the second half and we knew that would unsettle them a little bit. I’m very pleased with the response, we showed a lot of character.

‘I just thought it was a brilliant afternoon. I might not stay up and watch it on Match of the Day later - I don’t think I can put myself through it again! But that’s what the cup is about. I played in the Leicester side that lost to Wycombe, and a guy, Roy Essandoh, signed from Telextext, scored the winner. And that was a League Two side knocking a Premier League side out.

‘So we have seen how it works and we wouldn’t have complained if we had got beat, but I am very, very pleased we are in the next round.’

As for Dale, they’ll still be toasting a drink to the Blyth hero for years to come.
