David Cameron is planning more electronic tags and longer curfews for serial offenders as it was revealed thousands are being let off with a slap on the wrist.

Some 4,500 criminals with 15 or more convictions were given a caution last year.

Tens of thousands more were handed fines, community sentences or suspended jail terms. Overall, some two-thirds of the worst serial offenders escaped jail, Ministry of Justice statistics show.

MPs said the figures betrayed the ‘soft justice’ system and called for more public control over sentences.

Today, it was reported the Prime Minister will toughen up non-custodial sentences.

Offenders will be sent to a 'virtual prison' , with a 16-hours-a-day curfew and judges and magistrates will be given the power to confiscate credit cards, passports and driving licences.

The plans will mean longers curfews and more electronic tags for offenders. No formal agreement has been reached, but ministers hope to publish the plan within six weeks.

Tory MP for Clacton, Douglas Carswell, said: ‘From November we get to elect our police chiefs. We now need to ensure democratic accountability over the rest of the criminal justice system.

‘So long as we leave it to the Secretary of State, we will never sort this problem out and get the criminal justice system we want and the public demands.

Changes: Justice Secretary Ken Clarke wants to promote better reform programmes rather than filling up prisons

‘Soft justice is a consequence of an unaccountable justice system.’

Sentencing
 figures published yesterday showed nearly 105,000 criminals with at 
least 15 previous offences came back before the courts in England and 
Wales.

More than one third were locked up. But 
67,461 were given a non-custodial sentence.

Around a third of those, 
20,553 were given community sentences and 16,149 were given a fine.

More than 11,000 were handed an absolute or conditional discharge – in effect no punishment at all.

A further 8,160 were given suspended jail sentences.

In 2004 the custody rate for offenders after 15 or more crimes was 42 per cent, nearly 7 per cent higher.

Overall, three quarters of crimes are committed by adults and juveniles with existing records.

Last year re-offending accounted for some 638,153 out of more than 850,000 offences.

Government officials suggested average prison sentences were at a ten-year high, with burglars locked up for an average of 19 months.

Average sentences for robbery and drug offences were also up.

Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has pledged to mount a ‘rehabilitation revolution’ to turn offenders away from crime.

He wants tougher community punishments and better reform programmes.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Overall re-offending is falling but the levels are still too high and we are determined to address the root causes of this behaviour.

‘We are making our jails places of hard work, toughening community sentences and making offenders pay back victims and communities.’
