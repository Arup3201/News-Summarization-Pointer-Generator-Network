Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany is in line for a timely return to action in the Champions League in Rome on Wednesday night.

The City skipper has missed the club's last two games with a hamstring injury and was not expected to make the flight to Rome ahead of a game Manuel Pellegrini's team must win if they are to qualify for the next stage of the competition.

But it is understood the Belgium international is increasingly positive that he has a chance of playing in the Olympic Stadium.

Kompany's return is a welcome boost for City manager Manuel Pellegrini ahead of the must-win match

City have plenty of work to do if they are to advance to the knockout phase of the Champions League

City will definitely be without Sergio Aguero, who limped out of Saturday's match with Everton

Kompany trained on Monday and has told Pellegrini he is ready to play if required. City may also welcome back playmaker David Silva, who has not played since October 29 because of a knee problem.

Meanwhile centre forward Sergio Aguero is expected to be out for longer than the four weeks initially expected after scans showed his knee injury to be the same problem as the twisted medial ligament suffered by Silva against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup.
