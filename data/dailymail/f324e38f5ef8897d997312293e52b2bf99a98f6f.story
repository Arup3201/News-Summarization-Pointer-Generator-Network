A Washington family grieving for a solider who was killed in Afghanistan nearly two years ago have learned he was actually slain by friendly fire.

U.S. Army Sgt. Nathan Wyrick, a father-of four from Enumclaw, was on his second tour of duty when he was killed in October 2011. The Defense Department reported that the 34-year-old died from 'combat-related injuries'.

But nearly two years on, a Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that a mortar round intended for an insurgent malfunctioned and landed on Wyrick's tent, killing him.

'You know that they're in harm's way, 
but you don't expect this,' Ron Smith, Wyrick's father-in-law, told KOMO 4. 'He was a supply sergeant, he 
wasn't a frontline infantryman.'

Loss: US Army Sgt. Nathan Wyrick, 34, was killed when a mortar malfunctioned and landed on his tent

The truth of his death came to light after The News Tribune submitted a Freedom of Information request for the details surrounding the incident involving the 10th Mount Third Brigade.

It revealed that after an insurgent fired on the base on October 10, 2011, Wyrick's fellow soldiers began deploying rounds, even though they could not see their attacker.

The response was routine and Wyrick and other soldiers were waiting out the battle in their tents. The first rounds appeared to land where the team believed the insurgent was hiding.

But one of the rounds landed on Sgt. Wyrick’s tents directly above his bed, while two others landed close by. He was left with a fatal chest wound and six other soldiers were injured.

Left behind: Wyrick was a devoted family man to his wife Rachel and their four young sons

Friendly fire deaths are common in combat, but the Defense Department has not released an official number from Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2009, The Pentagon released reports showing that 0.78 per cent of Iraq casualties and 1.24 per cent of Afghanistan casualties were caused by friendly fire. It noted that only 24 of the 3,059 U.S. Army soldiers killed in Iraq since 2003 died by fratricide.

But Salon, which published the data, questioned whether this was reliable. It noted that this number is far less Army studies showing that friendly fire likely caused up to 16 per cent of fatal casualties in World War II, 7 percent in the Korean War, 14 percent in Vietnam and 24 percent in the Gulf War.

'After we found out what happened we just sat there in shock,' one of the soldiers wrote in the report.

A military inquiry into the incident concluded that the soldiers 'appropriately followed procedures and that the calculations directing the rounds to their intended targets also were correct'.

While the information was not released to the public, the Army did not withhold it 
from Wyrick's widow, Rachel - but she waited nearly a year, until August 2012, before she was ready to hear the truth in a full briefing from the Army.

Wyrick left behind Rachel and their four sons. He had each of their names tattooed on his body.

'You don't find a lot of hands-on dads,' Rachel, 37, told The News Tribune.

'He was so 
good with kids, and he was such a good person to me. He's awesome. He's 
my best friend.'

Missed: Wyrick's family are still struggling to come to terms with their loss more than a year and a half later

His father-in-law added: 'I
know that happens in war, but what a disappointment that his life was 
lost because of someones, perhaps, fault or mistake.'

Wyrick was born in Palm 
Springs, California and grew up in the Puyallup, Washington area before moving to Enumclaw. He worked as an electrician before joining the Army to support his family.

He was first deployed to Iraq between 2008 and 2009. He was a supply specialist who was supporting Operation Enduring Freedom when he died.
