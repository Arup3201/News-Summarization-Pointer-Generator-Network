It is the moment every model dreads - taking a tumble on the catwalk in front of the fashion pack and photographers.

But at least they're in good company, with this model on a Lagos runway enduring her own Naomi Campbell moment yesterday with cameras there to catch the look of horror on her face.

The model went head over heels as she walked in platform shoes and a knee-length printed dress for Nigerian fashion house Kinabuti in front of invited guests at the Italian consulate.

This is the mid-air moment a model realised she was headed for a fall during the Kinabuti catwalk show in Lagos yesterday

The accident, proving walking up and down a catwalk is far harder than some may think, will bring to mind Miss Campbell's own fall as she modelled for Vivienne Westwood in vertiginous heels at Paris Fashion Week in 1993.

The mock-crocodile Super Elevated Gillie shoes proved to be her undoing with five-inch platforms and nine-inch heels seeing her hit the deck - later becoming part of fashion history and finding a new home in the Victoria and Albert Museum collection.

Thankfully the rest of the Carnival in the Desert show went 
without a hitch for Kinabuti, a Lagos-based ethical fashion label run by
 Italian designer Caterina Bortolussi.

If anything, the label will be pleased that the model mishap has showcased its 2013 collection designs across the world - you can't buy that kind of publicity.

Other models for Kinabuti managed to stay upright in last night's show at the Italian consulate in Lagos
