FSU star player Jameis Winston's alleged rape victim had been hit and could only remember patchy details of the attack, according to newly-released 911 tapes today.

A friend of the woman can be heard on a 911 call to university police in Florida in the early hours of December 7 last year.

According to the tape, which was just released as part of public records, the alleged victim was 'very shaken up, hurt and got hit'.

The dispatcher on the call says: 'She got hit? Does she know what she got hit with?'

The female friend, who is not identified, then said: 'No she says she like kept blacking out, like she only remembers pieces.

'She keeps trying to tell me the story but it's very in pieces.'

The caller then confirms for the dispatcher that the woman said she was raped but that she doesn't remember the identity of her alleged attacker.

It took a month for the woman to identify Winston as the man who allegedly attacked her.

It was announced last Thursday by the Florida state's attorney that
19-year-old player Winston would not be charged with sexual assault due to 
insufficient evidence, after being accused by a female university 
student.

Police interviews with Winston's friends, who were at his apartment on the night of the alleged attack, were also released on Thursday, according to ABC. 

The friends said that the young woman and the quarterback did have sex but that it was consensual.

Winston's friends told police they saw the alleged victim perform oral sex on the quarterback and said she seemed 'more than willing'.

Heisman trophy favorite Winston spoke out for the first time this week
after sexual assault charges against him were dropped.  

The quarterback was part on the winning 
team this weekend who beat Duke 45-7 to take a place in the ACC 
Championship game against Auburn.

In a post-game interview, ESPN reporter
Heather Cox quizzed the star quarterback on the dismissed charges. 
Winston said: ''I gotta get more mature. I've gotta get better at everything I do.'

The player will be in New York on Saturday for the Heisman Trophy presentation ceremony.

The lawyer of Winston's accuser is due to hold a press conference on Friday with more information as the young woman continues to insist that she was raped.
