A leaked NHS report has revealed that cancer patients in the UK are being treated with obsolete radiotherapy machines.

Out of 269 machines, known as linear accelerators, 38 are more than 10 years old and should be replaced, while a further 139 are at least eight years old.

Modern machines, such as a state-of-the-art Gamma Knife machine, give patients better treatment.

The outdated machines, which use radiation to shrink tumours, also kill healthy tissue surrounding the cancer.

Modern machines use a single dose of highly focused radiation, designed 
to destroy only the tumour and leave the surrounding healthy tissue 
undamaged.

The document calls for an urgent review into the machines and states: 'The expected lifespan of a linear accelerator is 10 years.

'Machines older than this are considered outdated and often can no longer deliver modern radiotherapy techniques, which are linked to better patient outcomes.'

The document, seen by the Daily Mirror, was blasted by Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt.

She said: 'Patients won’t be safe if they keep these old machines working.

'They should be replaced with modern machines fit for the 21st century.'

She added that the UK is trailing other European countries in modern radiotherapy treatments.

The Gamma Knife is only available in four English cities.

Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer is worried about the revelations in the report.

He said: 'Radiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of bowel cancer.

'It’s vital that patients have access to the latest advanced radiotherapy techniques which target the cancer and cause less damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

'We’d be concerned about any apparent inequalities in the treatment of bowel cancer as a result of "outdated" technology.'

Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Radiotherapy is a life saving treatment, contributing to around four in 10 cancer cures.

'We want all patients who need it to have access to advanced radiotherapy techniques such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy that target the tumour more accurately and have fewer side effects.

'Since 2013 the Radiotherapy Innovation Fund has given thousands more patients access to IMRT and the NHS must be in a position to build on this success.'

A spokesperson from NHS England said: 'The commissioning of radiotherapy services is the responsibility of NHS England however the running and replacement of linear accelerators is the responsibility of the individual hospitals where the machines are located.

'NHS England is aware of the age of the current national stock of machines and supports the replacement of machines as they reach the end of their operational life. To support hospitals with older machines, the Department of Health has  recently launched a scheme to assist with purchasing of new linear accelerators.

'NHS England and Cancer Research UK will shortly be publishing a document outlining a vision for innovative radiotherapy services. This will be used to inform the production of a 5-year strategy for radiotherapy services.

'This will be supported by two other pieces of work being carried out by NHS England, which are close to completion, looking at the current provision of stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy services and the future anticipated capacity and demand.

'This will allow NHS England to plan services for patients which are clinically effective, accessible and represent a responsible investment of public monies.'

Radiotherapy is a treatment that involves the use of high-energy radiation. It is commonly used to treat cancer.

Almost half of all people with cancer have radiotherapy as part of their treatment plan.

More than 120,000 patients every year benefit from radiotherapy, which cures more people than cancer drugs. Tumour cells are destroyed quickly by X-rays, unlike normal cells.

Radiotherapy has to be aimed precisely. Even the slightest movement – such as the patient breathing – increases the risk of errors.

It is also sometimes used to treat benign (non-cancerous) tumours and other conditions - such as thyroid disease and some blood disorders.
