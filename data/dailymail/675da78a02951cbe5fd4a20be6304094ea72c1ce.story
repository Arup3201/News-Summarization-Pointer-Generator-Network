Former Sunderland and Scotland striker Kevin Kyle is providing for his family by working as a storeman on a ship in the Shetland Islands.

Kyle, who earned 10 caps for his country, left his last club Ayr United earlier this year and is now working 12-hour shifts on the Regina Baltica at Lerwick.

The ship serves as a 'floating hotel' for workers in the oil industry where, the Daily Record report, Kyle cleans floors, makes beds and replenishes stocks.

Asked by the Record about his £800-a-fortnight job, 33-year-old Kyle said: 'I'm trying to provide for my family.'

Kyle began his career at Sunderland in 2000, who he made 39 appearances for in the Premier League, scoring just the once.

He made his Scotland debut in 2002 and scored once for his country.

Spells at Coventry (who paid Sunderland £600,000 for his services in 2006), Kilmarnock, Hearts and Rangers plus a number of loan moves preceded his switch to Ayr United, who he last played for in January.

Kyle has not officially retired but has been without a club since leaving Ayr United.

The Stranraer-born Scot is a reformed gambler who once admitted to spending £7,000-a-week on betting. He has since given up time to warn young footballers about the dangers of gambling.

At the peak of his career Kyle was earning £10,000-a-week - equating to more money per day than he is now earning each fortnight.

Kyle had a brief spell at Rangers in the 2012-13 season and admitted his shock at how much players were earning at the financially crippled club.

He said: 'There are guys at Rangers who can’t believe their luck at what they earn.

'I asked a fellow pro in the summer, ‘Did Rangers really offer you that amount?’

'He said, "You know what? I think I could actually get even more off them".'

Brief stay: Kyle scores three goals in 11 games in all competitions in for Rangers
