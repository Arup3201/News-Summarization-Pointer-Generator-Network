Long distance lovers can speak for hours online using video services like Skype, but holding hands has been impossible, until now.

Scientists have created a wireless accessory that lets you hold your partner’s hand from anywhere in the world.

It uses haptic technology to mimic the sensation of someone giving you a reassuring squeeze of the hand, using a pair of two small devices.

Scientists have created a wireless accessory called Frebble (pictured) that lets you hold your partner's hand from anywhere in the world. It can be used alongside video chat services such as Skype so that people can see, hear and feel each other

Frebble uses haptic technology, or ‘tactile feedback’ to mimic the sensation of hand-holding through two devices.

Once the Frebbles have connected to each other through the internet, when one user squeezes their device, the other user will feel the sensation of their hand being held.

They do this thanks to two pressure sensors at the front of each device to register squeezing, two vibration motors on the side to make the sensation feel more real, and one integrated ‘squeeze bar’ to replicate holding hands.

A multicolour LED will indicate connection status and when a squeeze is waiting.

Frebble is the brainchild of entrepreneur Frederic Petrignani, of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. He is currently raising funds on Kickstarter to put the devices into production.

The Bluetooth device is not only intended to give people in long-distance relationships an extra way of communicating.

‘For a granddaughter calling grandma with special news, for a husband far away from a wife, for distant grown daughters who crave the comfort of their mother’s touch, for a best friend who wants to let her friend know it will all be ok, Frebble connects – as simply, subtly and as powerfully as though the person was right there with you,’ the company says.

‘While there are many ways to see and hear your loved ones through the power of the internet, the tactile element has been missing – until now. With Frebble, you can cut through the distance and share that smallest gesture – the squeeze of the hand – that means so much.’

The device is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in the hand and simulate the touch of holding and squeezing another person’s hand – and having that feeling reciprocated.

When a Frebble is squeezed by one person, the corresponding gadget will gently apply pressure to the back of a partner's hand, to simulate holding hands, wherever they may be

The device will be able to be used alongside video chat service such as Skype and Google Hangouts and the company says this will allow people to see, hear and feel the touch of people anywhere in the world.

Frebbles, which each measure around five inches long, contain a rechargeable Lithium Polymer battery and are made from plastic with rubberised padded areas so it can be gripped easily. A device can be used for four hours and lasts longer on standby.

The gadgets will be able to be recharged using a micro-USB cable and will work with Google Chrome version24 or higher and Firefox version 16 and higher.

Android and iOS apps for smartphones and tablets will also be available by September, when Frebble is due to be shipped. A pair of the devices cost $89 (£52) plus shipping as an ‘early bird special’ on Kickstarter.
