The supercar in which Paul Walker died this week left professionals who tested it 'white' with fear and has been branded 'the most dangerous car on the road' by a former manufacturer.

The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Roger Rodas when it crashed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, killing both of them.

It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fibre frame and 5.7 litre race-derived V10 engine.

Too dangerous? Both professionals and engineers have voiced concern about the supercar's suitability for the road

It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models.

Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity when they launched the model in 2004. According to TMZ, a memo circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.'

'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.)

'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar.

In a chequered past, the GT has been crashed by chat show legend Jay Leno, who lost control while speeding around a circuit in 2005.

Another incident in 2005 saw two sportscar enthusiasts Ben Keaton and Corey Rudl killed in a racetrack smash in California after the Carrera GT they were travelling in swerved into a concrete wall.

In that case, Porsche paid a portion of the $4.5million compensation fee awarded to the family of Mr Rudl after it was established there were 'handling problems' with the vehicle. 

Before its official release eight years ago, notable car experts gave excited but cautionary reviews of the GT, in which the cars power and speed were repeatedly lauded alongside notes about how it was prone to steering off course.

Speaking about testing the car at Germany's famous Nurburgring, Walter Rohrl, a former world rally champion and Porsche test driver, told Drive magazine: '[It was] the first car in my life that I drive and I feel scared... I came back into the pits and I was white.'

That was echoed by renowned car critic Jeremy Clarkson when he reviewed the Carrera for hit British BBC motor show Top Gear.

'The dangerous part is that it requires immense skill to drive, and is tremendously unforgiving.'

- Doug DeMuro, former Porsche worker

During his test drive, the expert repeatedly lost control of the car on an empty race track.

And, although being thrilled by its pace and power, he described the supercar's engine as a 'landmine'.

He said: 'I have never felt anything like that.

'You need to be awake to drive this fast. It really isn't an easy car to control, the clutch is brutal, the power is savage, and the handling... you really are on a knife edge.

'Other cars forgive you, but make a mistake in that and it bites your head off.

'[That] v.10 engine is a landmine'.

Writing on car site Jalopnik.com, Doug DeMuro said: 'The most dangerous car on the road. Very sad.

'The dangerous part is that it requires immense skill to drive, and is tremendously unforgiving.

'And it's hard to understand the car's limits because it's unlike virtually any other car on the road, and it'll respond in ways other cars won't.

Erratic: During a TV review first broadcast in Britiain in 2004, the Carrera GT was seen to be prone to swerving out of control

Caution: When reviewing the car in 2004, British TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson said the car was unforgiving, saying 'you need to be awake to drive this fast'

Although the car was the fastest to complete a lap of the show's course Clarkson, described the motor's engine as a 'landmine'

'I personally think it's the most dangerous car out there for this reason, and I know several people - including a couple of former owners - who agree.'

The 2005 crash for which Porsche accepted partial liability, bears a striking similarity to the accident which claimed the life of the Paul Walker and Roger Rodas.

Then, Carrera GT owner Ben Keaton offered to give fellow car fan Corey Rudl a ride in his new sports car at the California Speedway track.

After another driver in a Ferrari pulled out in front of the pair, they swerved to avoid a collision but careered straight into the track's concrete wall.

After Mr Rudl's wife took legal action alleging the wrongful death of her husband Porsche agreed to pay eight per cent of a total $4.5 compensation fee.

ENGINE SIZE: 5.7ltr

CYLINDERS: V10

TOP SPEED: 205 mph

ACCELERATION: 0-62 mph = 3.9s

FUEL CONSUMPTION: 13.2 mpg

DRIVE TYPE: Rear Wheel Drive

GEARBOX: Manual, 6 Speed

UNLADEN WEIGHT: 3042 lbs OR 1380 kg

During the case it was established that the Carrera GT was designed without electronic stability control, which Porsche calls PSM.

Craig McClellan, a former racer and a successful plaintiffs' attorney from San Diego represented the Rudls.

He alleged the lack of a PSM system was probably a marketing decision as the model was initially billed as a 'race car for the streets' and track cars are generally made without a stabilising system to counter over-steer.

Speaking after the settlement, he told SportsCarMarket.com that the Carrera GT should be 'feared'.

He said:  'Most people, especially those with children on the streets and highways, would fear a vehicle like the Carrera GT, with its tricky handling characteristics, 600-plus horsepower, and unskilled, unqualified drivers.

'When a 'race car for the streets' is sold to anyone with enough money, regardless of his ability to drive it, and it doesn't even incorporate modern electronic safety devices that correct driver errors, then maybe the manufacturer should accept some responsibility for the foreseeable deaths that will result.'

Mail Online have contacted Porsche but a spokesperson refused to comment.
