Wikipedia recently had me down as 45-years-old. Clearly someone on the site must have thought I had aged 20 years in the past few weeks due to my nocturnal lifestyle.

I've also seen some rather disparaging remarks recently on the MailOnline comments page (always very amusing) about my increasingly wrinkled visage.

A bit harsh but it was fair to say that the old boat race had taken a bit of hit from three to four weeks of non-stop party action, and so I've taken on board the kind advice, and decided to take some drastic anti-ageing measures.

Spurred on by some rather sharp comments, Spencer went in search of some drastic anti-aging measures

Several female friends - Louise Thompson, Binky Felstead - regularly use an anti-ageing facial called Skinbreeze, so why not?

I like to think I'm in touch with my feminine side and confident enough of my masculinity to try a facial. I'm a 21st century metrosexual man, and surely enough social taboos have been broken down nowadays that a man can have regular beauty treatments and not have to keep them a secret.

So I went to see top London facialist Debbie Thomas at her spa on Brompton Road above Hari's hair salon. I lay down on the beauty couch in the private treatment room and wondered what's going to happen next. Will it hurt? Is it addictive? Will I look unrecognizable afterwards?

Debbie Thomas puts me at ease right away but spotted immediately that late nights and too much sunbathing had damaged my skin. But help was at hand and the Skinbreeze treatment was surprisingly relaxing.

Spencer counts himself as a metrosexual man and isn't afraid of a little pampering every now and then

1. Microdermabrasion - takes off the dead skin, red light helps repair the skin.It feels very relaxing like a face massage. I feel myself dropping off to sleep.

2. Oxygen infusion of hydrating serums - too much drinking and not enough sleep have left my skin dry as a bone, and dark circles round my eyes. This is epic and smoothes out wrinkles from the skin.

3. The Hydro Mask - it feels cool and soothing and although it did make me look like Hannibal Lecter.

The mask contains moisturizing hyralonic acid and there was an amazing massage during this section. Thank you Debbie.

The mask came off and I looked amazing. The girls on the show aren't going to know what's hit them, I'm going to look about 10 years younger. So that's, what, 35 now?

Spencer was looking a little tired before his treatment (left) but was thrilled with the results of his Skinbreeze face mask (right) and said that he looked about ten years younger. What do YOU think?

Next up was a teeth-whitening session at LoveLite clinic in Harley Street. I was in dire need of this as red wine and coffee had left my teeth far from pearly white. The treatment is a perfectly safe non-peroxide treatment, and an hour later after wearing a strange UV device in my mouth my teeth were left gleaming, and got better still a day later. No sensitivity, just really white teeth.

And now to make sure that I don't age prematurely in the future I've been advised by beauty editor Emma Leslie at high-end cosmetics website Escentual.com to include these male grooming products into my daily routine.

Exfoliate once a week with Clarins Men 2 in 1 Exfoliating Cleanser and wash every day with Zirh Alpha Hydroxy Face Wash, then moisturize with Lab Series Instant Skin Booster and Lab Series Pro LS All in One Face Treatment. A little under-eye boost with Nuxe Men Multi-Purpose Eye Cream.

Apparently getting eight hours sleep a night, drinking plenty of water and staying out of the sun will help a lot too, but perhaps that's going a bit too far in the pursuit of beauty.

Lots of love, Spencer.
