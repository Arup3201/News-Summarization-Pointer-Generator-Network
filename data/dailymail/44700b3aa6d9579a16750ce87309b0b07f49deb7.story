Key proposals in the Leveson Report could harm investigative journalism, the Information Commissioner warned yesterday

Key proposals in the Leveson Report could harm investigative journalism, the Information Commissioner warned yesterday.

Currently reporters are given a wide exemption from data protection rules, allowing them to secretly collect information about corrupt officials, politicians or criminals in preparation for a story.

But Lord Justice Leveson proposed a sharp narrowing of the rules so that personal data can be held only if it is absolutely necessary for a specific article that is set for publication.

Christopher Graham, who as information commissioner is the national data protection and freedom of information watchdog, yesterday formally responded to the press standards inquiry and endorsed concerns that the changes could undermine investigative journalism.

And he said that, if implemented in full, the Leveson  proposals on data protection would move his office ‘closer to being a mainstream statutory regulator of the press’.

He added: ‘The significance of the proposed changes should not be underestimated. 

‘We acknowledge the importance of ensuring that data protection legislation does not undermine the work of the press and the implications it can have for freedom of expression.

‘The area of subject access is particularly problematic in that there are legitimate concerns about the “chilling effect” Lord Justice Leveson’s proposal might have on investigative journalism.’ 

The Leveson proposals could force journalists to hand over any personal data they held on someone they were investigating, unless it was absolutely necessary for a specific article which was set for publication.

Results of a survey by the Press Complaints Commission last night found nearly 80 per cent of those asked said their complaint had been handled either very well, well or satisfactorily by the body. Commission staff won 86 per cent approval in the survey.
