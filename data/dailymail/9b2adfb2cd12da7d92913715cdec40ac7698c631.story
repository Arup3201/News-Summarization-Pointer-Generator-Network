A Kansas man ate pizza, smoked marijuana and watched almost two episodes of 'Game of Thrones' with his partner before remembering his 10-month-old foster daughter was still inside a sweltering car, authorities said.

Seth Jackson, 29, faces a first-degree murder charge in the July 24 death in Wichita. No charges have been filed against his partner, who has been identified as Payton Schroeder.

Jackson remembered the girl after hearing a child's cries on the HBO program, Schroeder told police, according to an affidavit obtained by Kansas.com. They reportedly watched one-and-a-half episodes.

Police say the girl was inside the car with the windows up for more than two hours. It was around 90 degrees outside. An autopsy showed she died of hyperthermia due to heat exposure.

Foster father: Seth Jackson, pictured, reportedly smoked marijuana and watched Game of Thrones before remembering his foster daughter was inside a hot car for two hours

Victim: Kadillak Poe Jones was reportedly in the sweltering car for two hours while her foster got high and watched the HBO fantasy drama

The girl has been identified by local media as Kadillak Poe Jones. Police have not released her name, however, and documents in the case only use her initials.

The affidavit says Schroeder told police that Jackson called that day to let him know he would be picking Kadillak up from the baby sitter after taking their 5-year-old adopted child to a doctor's appointment.

Jackson told police that when he arrived home, he locked the car and went inside with his 5-year-old and pizza he had picked up.

Schroeder revealed to investigators that he and Jackson smoked marijuana that Jackson had earlier picked up that day, according to the affidavit.

Scene: When officers arrived, Jackson still on the phone, making calls and repeatedly stating, 'I left her in the car, she's dead, she's dead'

Both men said they ran to the car to retrieve Kadillak and call authorities.

Schroeder told investigators Kadillak was hot and stiff when she was taken from the car and carried into the house. As he called 911, Jackson attempted CPR but could not get the child's mouth open, according to the affidavit filed by Wichita police detective Ryan Schomaker.

Officers who responded found Jackson still on the phone when they arrived, making calls and repeatedly stating, 'I left her in the car, she's dead, she's dead,' according to the affidavit.

Meanwhile, Kadillak was unresponsive and lying on her back on the couch. Firefighters moved her from the couch to the floor once they arrived and attempted to revive her.

Family: In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and his partner had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7

Later in an interview at police headquarters, Schroeder told detectives he and Jackson had been foster parents to Kadillak since she was 2 weeks old.

Although the girl died of hyperthermia, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said the first-degree murder charge was warranted because the child died during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, aggravated endangering of a child. The case is not charged as intentional murder.

In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and Schroeder had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7. The two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time the 10-month-old died.

Jackson's Facebook account lists him as a paraprofessional for the Wichita school district.

Familiar: Jackson remembered Kadillak was in the car after hearing a child cry on Game of Thrones

'It always struck me he had empathy, compassion and patience with the students,' former substitute teacher Tom Fleming recently told KWCH. 'It just struck me, what a big heart, 5-6 kids at home and you're student teaching which you actually don't get paid for."

The Kansas Department of Children and 
Families (DCF) said in a July 30 statement 'We remain deeply saddened 
that this child suffered such a horrific death. We support the charges 
filed in this case, and we will aid in any way possible the prosecution 
of the defendant.'

The children were taken by the state, KAKE reported, and Jackson 'was released on bond around 5 p.m. on Saturday.'Â 

Prosecutors and Jackson's attorneys agree the circumstances are entirely different than a widely publicized case in Georgia, where a father faces murder and child cruelty charges on suspicion of intentionally leaving a 22-month-old boy inside a hot car last month as he went to work.
