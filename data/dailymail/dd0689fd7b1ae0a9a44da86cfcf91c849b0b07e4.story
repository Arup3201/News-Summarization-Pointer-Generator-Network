Sean Dyche reacted brilliantly to a reporter accidentally questioning him on Burnley's 'title fight' after their 1-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday.

The Clarets are embroiled in a relegation battle at the bottom of the Premier League, but one journalist fluffed his lines, instead asking Dyche what the impressive result would 'do for their title fight'.

'Title fight?!,' Dyche replied incredulously, before pumping his fists and shouting, 'Get in there! Get in there! You beauty!'

'Come on you, love that from you', he continued, pointing at the reporter in question, before clarifying: 'I didn't say that, no headlines. I did not say we're in a title fight.'

Dyche was certainly in high spirits - and understandably so - after his side upset the odds to help their chances of survival, while in turn dealing a blow to their opponents in the actual title fight at the top of the league.

George Boyd scored the only goal of the game in the second half, and the Burnley manager believes that the correct team won the match.

'It was deserved, I think,' Dyche told reporters when the laughter had died down. 'Overall I think we edged it. It was a close game, why wouldn't it be against players of that calibre? 

'I'm obviously delighted with the outcome and the performance. I have said many times this season I think the players are improving. I think they are growing and learning at this level.

'It doesn't guarantee the future and there is still room for more, but this reinforces all the good work that has been done.'

Burnley fans were still hopeful of safety before the match, and the result will have given them more confidence

The Clarets' victory - despite some battling recent displays - was only their second in 13 games and pulled them within a point of 17th-placed Sunderland. 

'Our will and desire to be in the Premier League is all on show, but we won't get too carried away,' Dyche continued.

'We know there's a long way to go. The players are grounded.

'We haven't been broken from defeat - we've been dented a few times - but this win reinforces confidence and belief.
