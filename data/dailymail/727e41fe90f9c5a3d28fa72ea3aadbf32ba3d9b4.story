The mother of Gina DeJesus, who was held captive in an Ohio house of horrors for nine years, has said she would forgive Ariel Castro because she does not want to be consumed by hatred - a stark contrast to the initial reaction toward her daughter's alleged kidnapper.

Nancy Ruiz says she has known Castro for decades, having grown up in the same area, and often saw him in their Cleveland neighborhood.

Each time, she said that he would ask how she was holding up without her daughter.

Forgiveness: Speaking to ABC News' David Muir in an interview airing on Friday, Ms Ruiz said that despite Castro's alleged crimes, she would hug Castro and forgive him

Speaking to ABC News' David Muir in an interview airing on Friday, Ms Ruiz said that despite Castro's alleged crimes, she would forgive Castro if she saw him again.

She said: 'I would hug him and I would say, "God bless you." I would say, "God bless you," and I'd hug him. I did not hate him. I forgave him years ago. I said it: I forgive whoever done it, just let her go.'

'When you start to hate a person, that eats you up,' she said. 'I don't have time for that. I have to be, you know, I want to be happy, like I am now.'

The statement is a complete turnaround from her initial reaction when she learned that her daughter was alive - and had been a prisoner for nine years.

Ms Ruiz collapsed to the ground and cried out for vengeance after learning she had been held captive, a family friend told MailOnline on Wednesday. 

'Matalo!' Nancy Ruiz shouted as she fell to the ground, Lupe Collins told MailOnline on Wednesday.

The phrase is Spanish for 'Kill him.'

Ms Collins says she rushed to the 
home on Seymour Avenue after hearing that Gina and two other missing 
women were found captive there.

She said she watched as an FBI agent 
showed Gina to Mrs DeJesus so she could positive identify that the woman
police had rescued was her daughter.Ms Collins says she worked closely 
with Gina's mother and father Felix DeJesus to raise community 
awareness of Gina after she was abducted while walking home from Burger 
King. 

Ariel Castro's daughter Arlene is thought to be the last person who saw Gina before her disappearance.

On Tuesday, Ariel's son Anthony told 
MailOnline that he thought it was possible his father targeted Gina 
because of her relationship with Arlene.

Gina gave a thumbs up as she arrived home on Wednesday before being hurried into her mother's home shielded by family.

Hundreds of well-wishers gathered in 
front of the DeJesus property, which was covered in balloons and signs, 
reading 'Welcome home Gina.'

Ms Ruiz spoke on Wednesday and asked for the family to be given time to heal.

She thanked those who had supported the family over the years along with the police and FBI for all their hard work.

Ms Ruiz appealed to the public to be on 
the look-out for another missing girl Ashley Summers, who was snatched 
in 2007 from the same Cleveland neighborhood when she was 14.

Ms Ruiz said: 'There are not enough words to say or express for the joy we feel for the return of our family member Gina.

'We are asking for your support to be patient with us. Give us time and privacy to heal. When we're ready, I promise you…we will talk to you.'

Miss DeJesus' mother and father smiled and gave thumbs up to supporters. 

'They never gave up hope. Felix never gave up hope that she was alive,' said neighbor Michael Pendershot, 47, who lives three houses down from the DeJesus family.
