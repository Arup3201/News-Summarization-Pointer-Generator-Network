Only 12 men have scored in every round of the FA Cup in its 143-year history. 

Bradford’s Jon Stead hopes he can join them — and he’ll be one step closer if he nets against Reading in their quarter-final on Saturday.

Here are the fascinating stories behind the deadly dozen... 

Archie Hunter (Aston Villa, winners 1887)

The Scot was one of the first footballing celebrities of the Victorian era. ‘Old Warhorse’ captained Villa to their first FA Cup with a 2-0 victory over West Brom at the Kennington Oval. Forced to retire in 1890 after a heart attack on the pitch, he later died of heart failure aged 35.

Sandy Brown (Tottenham, winners 1901)

Hailing from the same Ayrshire mining village as Bill Shankly, Brown was known as the ‘Glenbuck Goalgetter’. Spurs became the only non-League side to win the FA Cup thanks to his goals. During Brown’s Scotland debut against England, part of the terracing at Ibrox collapsed, killing 25 fans.

Harry Hampton (Aston Villa, winners 1905)

‘The Whirlwind’ remains Villa’s all-time leading scorer in League football with 215 goals. He was a fearless forward and once scored having barged 22-stone goalkeeper William ‘Fatty’ Foulke over the line with the ball in his arms. He served at the Somme during World War One and survived a poisonous gas attack.

Harold Blackmore (Bolton, winners 1929)

Blackmore was a goalscoring sensation as a teenager playing for Silverton, a village team in Devon. He also worked at the local paper mill before signing for Exeter City and then moving to Bolton for £2,150, a princely sum in 1927. It looked as though his chance of scoring in every round had gone as Bolton led Portsmouth 1-0 at Wembley, but Blackmore netted at the death to seal his place in history.

Ellis Rimmer (Sheffield Wednesday, winners 1935)

The Scouser was a showman, attracting big crowds as a jazz pianist. Left winger Rimmer was the first non-striker to score in every round after his late brace in the 4-2 win over West Brom. The England man later ran the Hallamshire House pub in Sheffield before returning to Formby, where he died aged 58.

Frank O’Donnell (Preston, runners-up 1937)

The Scot was one of 15 siblings and played in the final against Sunderland alongside brother Hugh, as well as Bill Shankly. O’Donnell became the first player to score in every round but end on the losing team. He died 15 years later in Macclesfield aged just 40 after a short illness. A tribute in Glasgow’s Evening Times described him as one of the finest players of his generation.

Stan Mortensen (Blackpool, runners-up 1948)

Mortensen is better known for becoming in 1953 the only player to score a hat-trick in an FA Cup final. Five years earlier his side lost to Manchester United as he became the first post-war player to score in every round. A Blackpool legend, there is a statue of him outside Bloomfield Road.

He died aged 69 in 1991, just nine days before Blackpool appeared at Wembley for the first time since the 1953 final.

Jackie Milburn (Newcastle, winners 1951)

‘Wor Jackie’ — cousin of Bobby and Jack Charlton — was Newcastle’s top scorer until Alan Shearer broke his record in 2006. He scored both goals in the 2-0 victory over Blackpool in the 1951 final, defended the Cup in 1952 and scored after 45 seconds in the 1955 final win. Milburn later reported on Newcastle for the News of the World and predicted a teenage Paul Gascoigne would become the best player in the world.

Nat Lofthouse (Bolton, runners-up 1953)

Lofthouse completed his scoring feat in the ‘Matthews Final’ in which he gave Bolton the lead, only to end up losing 4-3. It was a final attended by Queen Elizabeth II. He did get his hands on the Cup after scoring in the 1958 final, when he barged Manchester United keeper Harry Gregg over the line, later admitting it was a foul. He is Bolton’s record scorer with 285 goals. There is a statue of him outside their stadium.

Charlie Wayman (Preston, runners-up 1954)

Wayman worked at Chilton Colliery in County Durham and served in the Royal Navy during World War Two. He was a team-mate of the great Tom Finney in the 1954 final as Preston were beaten 3-2 by West Brom and it was reported that his goal looked suspiciously offside. The pint-sized centre forward was a crowd-pleaser and it was a mystery how he never won England honours.

Jeff Astle (West Brom, winners 1968)

Jeff Astle — ‘The King’ as he was known to West Brom fans —scored the only goal in the 1968 victory over Everton, while his strike in a League Cup final defeat by Manchester City two years later saw him become the first player to score in both domestic finals at Wembley.

Astle died at 59 and the Justice for Jeff campaign has since been launched calling for an independent inquiry into a link between degenerative brain disease and heading footballs. Baggies fans still applaud during the ninth minute of every match in memory of their great No 9.

Peter Osgood (Chelsea, winners 1970)

Another dubbed ‘The King’ by supporters, Osgood is the last player to score in every round. His goal forced extra-time in the replay versus Leeds, with David Webb netting the winner. Osgood is an icon at Stamford Bridge because of his flair and personality, both on and off the pitch. He died aged 59 following a heart attack at a family funeral. His ashes were buried beneath the penalty spot in front of the Shed End and a statue was later unveiled outside the stadium.
