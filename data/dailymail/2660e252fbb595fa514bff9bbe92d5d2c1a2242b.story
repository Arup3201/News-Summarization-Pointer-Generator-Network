An artist has enlisted a real-life Rapunzel and her flowing locks of hair to spell out the Roman alphabet in ornate lowercase letters for her art project.

Student designer Shurong Diao, 24, decided to dispense with pens and brushes for the series, which she made in her studio in New York City.

Instead she constructed an entire alphabet using only a naked modeland long tresses.

Diao, originally from Hangzhou in eastern China, said the typeface was intended to mirror Chinese calligraphy, in which letters are written with ink on rice paper.

'I was 
always obsessed with Chinese culture. I just realised I'd like to use 
hair as a medium to collapse Chinese culture back to Roman letters,' 
she said.

'In the beginning I wanted to find real hair, but I couldn't find any women with hair that long.'

The artist had to use a mixture of real hair and extensions to achieve the length necessary to trace out the Latin alphabet's ascenders and descenders.

She then photographed her friend and fellow 
classmate, Xingpei Wang, posing naked with coils of hair-letters 
arranged around her body.

Diao, still an undergraduate graphic design student at the School of Visual Arts in New York, is at the beginning of a promising art career.

'I wanted to build a connection between Chinese characters and Roman letters by using the distinct feature of Chinese women: their long black hair,' she tells design website Co.Design.

'This typeface is a way to uniquely imitate the effect of painting the English alphabet with ink on rice paper.'
