A quick-thinking two-year-old who dialled 999 after her mother collapsed and fell unconscious has been honoured with a police award.

Rowan Rychel calmly picked up the phone to emergency services and reported 'Mummy’s sleeping and she won’t wake up'.

Officers quickly traced the call and paramedics sped to the scene, in Innerleithen in the Scottish Borders, where they found Rowan’s mother Francesca slumped on the floor.

After coming round she was rushed to Borders General hospital, in Melrose, Scotland, where she was kept in overnight for observation before being allowed home the following day.

Yesterday Rowan, now three, was awarded a Meritorious Award by Chief Constable David Strang of Lothian and Borders police.

But her proud mother revealed that her daughter's life saving efforts in September 2011 might never have happened if she had not caught her playing with the phone.

Ms Rychel said: 'She was at that age when she was playing with the phone all the time and once she dialled 999.

'I told her off and said if she did that again the police would come. Thankfully it looks like that message got through and I’m so glad that she did phone 999 this time.

'I can’t remember much about that day. We were playing hide and seek and I got up from the sofa too quickly and I just passed out.

'The next thing I remember is coming round and finding the police there.'

She dislocated her knee and hit her head in the fall but did not suffer any lasting damage.

Rowan was commended at the awards ceremony at Lothian and Borders Police HQ, Edinburgh.

Mother Francesca couldn’t make the event but her father Robert, 36, a network administrator, said he was amazed by Rowan’s resourcefulness.

Mr Rychel said: 'It’s absolutely amazing - I’m so proud of Rowan. She was just a year old at the time.

'She’s a very clever girl for her age - and I keep having to say that to people.

'Rowan had previously dialled 999 by accident and her mum had told her that she was only meant to dial the number if there was an emergency - so it must have just stuck.

'She was completely unconscious when the police arrived and Rowan was just running around the house.

'My first reaction was disbelief. When I got the call at work, I rushed home immediately - I was about an hour away. I was dumbfounded when they told me what happened.

'We’re so very proud of her, but hope it doesn’t have to happen again. But if it does, she’s moved up from house phones onto mobiles now - so we should be in safe hands.'

Tiny Rowan said: 'I’m very proud of getting the award and I’m happy that I helped my mummy.

'I was a little bit scared but I phoned 999 - and I’m ready to do it again.'

Police spokesman Ali Chalmers hosted the prize giving section.

She said: 'Rowan stayed very calm when the ambulance was called and chatted away to the officers until the paramedics arrived.

'The officer involved was taken back by Rowan’s actions and we don’t know what might have happened if she didn’t make that emergency call.'

'Rowan is a credit to her family and we are proud to honour her.'
