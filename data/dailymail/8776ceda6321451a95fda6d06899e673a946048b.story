Tory MP Peter Bone's constituency home was raided by police last year

A Conservative MP was questioned by police over an alleged benefits fraud, it emerged last night.

Peter
 Bone's home was raided by police as part of a year-long inquiry into 
whether his elderly mother-in-law’s assets were deliberately concealed 
during her time in a care home.

Today the MP for Wellingborough insisted he is 'totally innocent' of allegations of benefit fraud.

He also criticised both the county council and the police force over their handling of the case.

Downing Street refused to be drawn on the case, pending the outcome of the legal investigations.

Mr
 Bone was questioned in relation to a dispute with Northamptonshire 
County Council about the funding of residential care for his 
mother-in-law, Dorothy Sweeney, which is currently the subject of a 
civil court case.

The Times 
reported that questions were asked about concerns that the council was 
not given accurate information about Mrs Sweeney's assets before 
providing benefits totalling around £100,000.

Anyone with assets of more than £23,250 is expected to pay their own care home fees.

In
 November, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service, which will 
decide whether there is enough evidence to lay charges.

Last night Mr Bone, who denies any wrongdoing, told the Mail he was facing a ‘personal nightmare at the hands of the police’.

He said that today he will complain to the CPS about the way he had been treated.

Mr
 Bone said: 'Ultimately, the issue at the heart of this dispute is very 
simple: either Jennie and I have looked after her mother properly, or we
 are devious, thieving, crooks.

'I
 know the answer to that question and based on all the evidence, which 
they have, they should know too that we are totally innocent.'

Mrs
 Sweeney has lived in a private care home for seven years but for part 
of that time, some of the fees were paid by Northamptonshire County 
Council.

The local authority is supposed to pay care fees only if the person has assets of less than £23,250.

The
 police acted over concerns that Mrs Sweeney had just sold a house and 
therefore should have been paying the full amount for her care because 
she had assets.

There is no 
suggestion that she acted improperly. Northamptonshire Police said a 
61-year-old man had been interviewed under caution in April ‘in 
connection with alleged fraud offences’.

Mr
 Bone said he accepted there was ‘a dispute regarding part of the care 
home fees’, and that his family have paid ‘substantial funds’ towards 
the fees.

‘It is absolutely untrue that any of Mrs Sweeney’s assets were hidden,’ he said.

‘They
 were all declared on the appropriate forms to the county council and 
this has never been challenged. There is no shortfall to the county 
council for £100,000.'

Mr 
Bone added: ‘Since March last year, my wife and I have been living 
through a surreal nightmare – two people who have always supported and 
respected the police, who have had their belief shattered.’

The MP denied the council’s claims and said a civil case with it was ongoing. He has written to the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police about the handling of the case.

Mr Bone is one of the Commons’ most colourful characters, often referring to ‘Mrs Bone’ when posing questions to ministers.

He
 so regularly phrases questions to David Cameron as being on her behalf 
that the Prime Minister once told the Commons that ‘a very big part of 
my life is trying to give pleasure to Mrs Bone’.

Asked
 about the allegations today, the Prime Minister's official spokesman 
said: ‘I think there's a process going forward here with the appropriate
 authorities and that's what should be followed.’

Mr
 Bone said the ‘most hurtful’ aspect of the affair was the suggestion 
that the couple may have ‘stolen’ his mother-in-law's money.

He
 pointed to a sworn affidavit in which she made clear she had signed 
over power of attorney so that her money could be used by her daughter 
‘to pay off personal debts incurred while she was ill and towards my 
grandson's school fees, as well as care home fees and personal 
expenses’.

A 
Northamptonshire Police spokeswoman said: ‘A 61-year-old man was 
formally interviewed under caution in April 2013 in connection with 
alleged fraud offences.

‘A police file was submitted to the CPS in November 2013 and we await their decision.’

A
 spokesman for Northamptonshire County Council said: ‘We have read the 
comments made by Peter Bone and contest many points he has made.

‘Because of ongoing legal considerations we cannot comment on this matter any further.’

The
 Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement: ‘In November 2013, the 
CPS received a file from Northamptonshire Police concerning a 
61-year-old man formally interviewed under caution in April 2013 in 
connection with alleged fraud offences.

‘We will reach a decision in this case as soon as is practicable.’

It is estimated that around 20,000 pensioners a year sell their homes to pay for their own care.

Under NHS rules, the majority of pensioners with assets worth more than £23,250 must fund their own care - including practically everyone who owns property.

Councils carry out assessments on people who are taken into care, and those who exceed the cap must contribute to costs.

Between £14,250 and £23,250 the cost is shared with councils, but above the threshold it is entirely up to those in care. Below £14,250, councils will still draw on a resident's income but will not touch their assets.

Councils are required to leave those in care with just £23.50 of their own each week to spend.

There are exceptions to the rules if a stay turns out to be temporary, and for those who have mental illnesses.

Recently councils have become more willing to investigate the financial affairs of the elderly in order to claw back costs of care.

‘Avoidance inspectors’ trawl through records to try and identify what they call ‘deliberate deprivation’ of assets.

Age UK has called for the cap to be raised to £100,000 so that pensioners can protect their homes and pass on more savings to their children.

The charity’s director general Michelle Mitchell has previously said: ‘The £23,250 cap is so sharp and is unfair on many people who have worked hard all their lives, because all their assets – including their home – are taken into account. They can see their savings swept away.’
