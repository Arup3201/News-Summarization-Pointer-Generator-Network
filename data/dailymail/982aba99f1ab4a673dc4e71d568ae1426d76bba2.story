When Lottie Hankins was born with a smudge in the corner of her mouth, her parents thought nothing of it. But they were horrified after it developed into a tennis ball-sized tumour that meant she couldn't eat or drink.

Now after years of pain, disbelieving doctors, name-calling, and surgery, little Lottie can finally smile.

Her mother Julia, 39, said: 'She had her final plastic surgery on
her mouth last year and it's made such a difference. Now she has normal
lips like me, which is what she wanted.

'Amazing girl': Lottie's parents said their daughter (pictured left as a baby) never complained about the pain she suffered over the years. She loves her new lips created using plastic surgery (right)

'She's confident and happy, with no side effects from all the nasty comments from strangers in the street.

'She's one amazing girl.'

Mrs Hankins, from Northampton, had a normal pregnancy apart from Lottie being born four weeks early.

It wasn't until they she and husband Simon, 42, took Lottie home
that they noticed the red 
mark near their baby's lip.

They showed it to the health visitor who came to inspect Lottie and were reassured it was probably a Port Wine Stain birthmark.

But it quickly grew bigger and then when Lottie was three months old she scratched it with her nail, leaving a nasty, weeping wound.

Julia
said: 'We took her to the hospital but they said nothing was wrong with
her. Lottie was crying all the time. She wasn't feeding and was getting
thin.

'I knew it was infected.'

Lottie was just a few days old when her parents spotted a smudge in the corner of her mouth

Medics discovered Lottie had 36 haemangiomas in total, including one on her nose (l), she had laser surgery to fade the birthmark (seen right with her sister Ellie)

The couple were so desperate 
for help that Julia's concerned grandfather, Joseph Parlett, offered to
pay for Lottie to see a specialist privately.

They spoke to a nurse 
at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London who told them to bring Lottie 
in immediately after Mrs Hankins said she wasn't eating.

It was then Lottie
was diagnosed with a haemangioma - blood vessels that grow and turn 
into benign tumours - and she was immediately given morphine.

Julia said: 'The doctor described the pain she was in was like someone cutting open her mouth with a knife. I was horrified.

'I'd been told there was nothing wrong by our local hospital so she'd had no pain relief. I felt awful.'

Lottie was severely dehydrated and so was put on a drip and tube fed.

Doctors had to remove her infected and scarred flesh because her mouth had become so painful.They also gave her steroids to help shrink the haemangioma.

Her
condition eventually improved to the relief of her parents but then the
infection returned and she stopped drinking again. Two weeks later, she
was allowed home from hospital.

But
at six months old, the tumour burst while Lottie was with her father 
out shopping. She was rushed to hospital because it wouldn't stop 
bleeding and she was treated with a special type of fibre glass.

Medics 
discovered Lottie had 36 haemangiomas in total, including one on her 
nose and another on her liver.

She was treated with steroids but these had no effect and her parents were forced to put up with stares wherever they went.

Mrs Hankins, said: 'Normally, when you have a baby people tell you how beautiful they are but that didn't happen.Medics 
discovered Lottie had 36 haemangiomas in total,

'People would stop her buggy, look in and say horrid things like "look at your baby's disgusting face".

'I liked to take the girls on the bus into town and one day, when Lottie was 18 months old, I saw a lady watching me.

'As she got off, she said she felt sorry for my daughter and threw Â£5 at her. I was shocked.

''I would try and hide her face when we 
were out. It wasn't because I was ashamed. To me, she was gorgeous but I
hated people staring.

'People couldn't see her for who she was because she had this huge growth on her face it was really upsetting.'

At two years old, Lottie had her first laser surgery, which helped the birthmark to fade. But she needed further operations to remove the tumour.

Mrs Hankins said: 'We didn't want it done to make her more 'acceptable'. We asked Lottie and it was her choice to go ahead with the surgery. She said: "I want normal lips like Mummy."

'Before her mouth and nose were wonky but now it's much better. Her face is more symmetrical. She's really happy with it.

'She will need check-ups now until her teens then another tidy up surgery but it finally feels like our nightmare is over.'

Mr Hankins added: 'It was horrendous watching her go through what she did. As a parent, you want to take away their pain.

'She's never complained though. Lottie is very matter of fact and just gets on with things.
