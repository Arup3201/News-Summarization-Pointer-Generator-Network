One Direction fans looking to take the perfect snap with their favourite boy band with the help of their selfie stick will sadly be disappointed.

The venue hosting the Brisbane leg of the teenage heartthrobs on their On the Road Again Tour has banned Directioners - the name given to the group's keen followers. 

The restriction is listed under Suncorp Stadium's One Direction Frequently Asked Questions section.

Selfie sticks are incredibly popular, particularly amongst tweens, and have become a commonplace item at concerts. They can be used to take the perfect high-angle selfie or capture a quality image of the performers

A girl takes a picture with a selfie stick at Beat The Drum music festival in Sydney in January. Selfie sticks are now banned from many venues, including Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane for the upcoming One Direction gig

'For the safety and comfort of other patrons, selfie sticks are not permitted into the stadium for this event,' the stadium's website said.

Other restricted items include alcohol, pepper spray or mace, fireworks, studded jewellery, spurs and unusually long wallet chains.

If anyone is found with any of these items during the performance, they 'may be subject to detention or possible eviction from the stadium without refund'.

But it seems that will not ruin any of the fun planned by the super group, with the band being well-received by Sydneysiders on Saturday night when they kicked off their tour in Australia.

Going off with a bang! One Direction kicked off their Sydney show with a vibrant display at Allianz Stadium on Saturday night

They put on a colourful display of fireworks for fans at their first concert Down Under.

Allianz Stadium glowed in deep reds and sunset oranges as the beloved boy band took their bows.

Despite the long-haul flight to Australia, the fab five looked fresh and delivered an impressive high-energy, two-hour set.

Kicking off their monster show with Clouds, every punter in the crowd appeared to know the words and sung along enthusiastically.

Heartthrob Harry Styles looked every inch a rockstar in a crisp black shirt, super tight jeans and shiny gold boots.

The former baker initially wore his curly locks out but after much writhing about on stage, he swept his cumbersome mane up and styled it into his world famous man bun.

Total entertainment: 1D will be supported by McBusted and local act Samantha Jade

Dreamy: Louis Tomlinson cut a striking figure against the incredible backdrop of the stadium 

Screams of joy reverberated through the crowd when 1D gave their very own rendition of Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson's current hit Uptown Funk.

Meanwhile delighted fans quickly jumped on Twitter to praise the lads' show: 'The fireworks at one direction concerts are bigger than my grades and brighter than my future,' one user joked.

'Wow. just wow! A night I'll never forget. Those boys sure know how to put on a good show,' another added.  

Finishing off the evening with their smash hit Best Song Ever ensured punters worked up a sweat on the dance floor. 

The bigger the better! The boys were dwarfed by the enormous fireworks going off in the background 

Ahead of the show, Harry took to Twitter to express his excitement: 'On The Road Again is about to start, very excited to be back in Australia. Can't wait to see everyone out there. All the love,' he wrote.

'Today was like 1st day at school and u sit at your test paper and everything goes except there's lots of people and I had no pen,' Liam added. 

'Amazing first show! Love you Sydney!!!' Louis agreed. 

This marks One Direction's fourth headlining concert and will promote the band's fourth studio album, appropriately named Four. 

British band McBusted and local songstress Samantha Jade are supporting the group during the Australian leg of their tour. 

On The Road Again will cover some serious ground jetting around Asia, Europe and North America before wrapping up at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield, England, at the end of October.
