A Miami high school student brutally raped at female teacher at his school after choking until she passed out, police say.

Victor Marshall Nash, 18, is charged with attempted first degree murder, sexual battery, robbery and grand theft for the alleged attack on his teacher at South Dade Senior High School on Friday. 

Detectives say two hours after the last class ended, Nash approached the teacher and put his arm around her. When she told him 'No, stop,' he body-slammed her to the ground and smashed her head against the floor.

Shocking charges: Victor Marshall Nash, 18, is accused of brutally raping his teacher at South Dade High School after class on Friday after choking her until she passed out

The 6-foot-1, 200lb teen then choked the teacher until she passed out. While she was unconscious, he raped her and left the used condom in her purse, police say. 

The teen then threw his victim's cell phone in the garbage and stole her car keys. When the teacher came to, Nash was gone.

Nash is 6-foot-1 and weighs more than 200lbs, authorities say

Police found him five hours later driving the teacher's car nearby.

Officers say Nash confessed to the crimes.  

The teachers union confirmed that Nash had attacked at teacher and said in a statement: 'We are shocked and dismayed by the event reported at South Dade Senior High. 

'Our schools should be a place of safety and serenity, not only for students, but the adults who work there as well.'

Nash's father, Victor Marshall Nash Sr., is a convicted sex offender who has also been arrested in the past on child abuse charges. 

He told WVSN-TV that he was 'shocked' to hear his son had been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a teacher.

'When me and his mother were together, we tried to raise him, I guess you can say, as both loving parents,' the elder Mr Nash said. 

He said he doesn't think his son knows about his father's arrest.  

The attack happened at South Dade Senior High School, where Nash is a student and his victims works as a teacher, authorities say
