It’s 2pm on a drizzly Monday and I’m sitting in a doctor’s waiting room. A selection of well thumbed magazines are strewn across a coffee table and in the corner, a young couple whisper nervously to each other.

It could be a snapshot from any GP’s surgery in the land, but for one crucial difference: we all have needles hanging out of our arms, attached to bright yellow IV drips.

Intravenous vitamin infusions – so-called ‘healthy’ cocktails pumped straight into the bloodstream to fight fatigue, boost energy levels and sharpen mental performance - are becoming big business.

Earlier this week Rita Ora tweeted a photo of herself hooked up to an IV drip before filming her new music video

They’re the natural evolution of the vitamin injections that have been doing the rounds in the US since the 1960s, and are being fuelled by a growing celebrity fan base (Rita Ora posted photos of herself hooked up to a vitamin drip two days ago, while Cheryl Cole, Katy Perry and even Simon Cowell are all reputedly devotees).

Now, specialist clinics offering the procedure - as either a direct injection or the more efficient IV drip - have started appearing across the UK as a quick health fix for the cash-rich, time-poor.

Think about it: in a world where many of us consume most of our five a day from Pret containers, is it any wonder a treatment that offers a more direct route to better short-term health, glowing skin and boosted immunity is so sought after?

Hooked-up health

It’s not a new trend in some parts of the world. In Japan, for instance, IV cafes offer entire menus of vitamin drips, from jabs that burn fat to those claiming to boost skin radiance.

In the US, the ‘Hangover Heaven’ bus has been circling Las Vegas for years, offering the burnt-out victims of Sin City an immediate intravenous pick-me-up.

Just a few months ago, model Cara Delevingne tweeted a picture of herself hooked up to a vitamin drip to help her recover from a cold.

One of the first to advertise the treatment in the UK was the London based Infusion Clinic, which has been administering vitamin drips from its Harley Street centre since the start of 2013.

Founder Geeta Sidhu-Robb says more than 1,000 patients have already paid for the procedure, to the tune of £100 to £450 per hit.

'The majority of our clients are high achievers in their late thirties, and it’s evenly split between the sexes,' she says.

'Typically, it’s individuals who work very long hours and travel frequently - people who simply cannot afford to get ill.'

Sidhu-Robb claims the four IV drips her clinic offers - ranging from immunity and vitality-boosting treatments to an anti ageing cocktail, all containing a blend of minerals such as magnesium, calcium and potassium and vitamins C and B12 - are '10,000 times' better than the benefits you glean from your standard five-a-day diet.

'The results are phenomenal,' she says. 'These infusions make you look younger as well as armour-plating your immune system. I haven’t been sick once since I started using them 12 months ago.'

Too much of a good thing

The concept of vitamin IV treatments began in the US more than 50 years ago, when a Baltimore physician named John Myers invented the Myers’ Cocktail, containing a combination of vitamins B and C, as well as calcium and magnesium to treat a broad range of conditions from muscular strain to chronic fatigue.

Over the past 12 months, the continual drip-drip of celebrity testimonials has been enough for the trend to soak into the public consciousness on this side of the Atlantic, too.

A preventative solution that doesn’t involve spending hours at the gym or your entire life savings in Whole Foods? Sounds too good to be true.

And perhaps it is. A number of British health experts have voiced doubts, claiming the drips are at best a serious waste of cash and at worst potentially harmful.

Cara Delevingne posted an Instagram photo taken while on an IV drip with girlfriend Michelle Rodriguez back in January

'When you eat food, your body breaks it down in your digestive system, taking what it needs and creating hormones such as insulin, glucagon and serotonin in the process,' explains Simon White, a senior technical adviser at multivitamin company Nature’s Best.

'Ingesting pure vitamins intravenously completely bypasses your body’s natural checks and measures.'

NHS GP Dr Ranj Singh goes even further. 'People say you can’t have too much of a good thing, but of course you can,' he warns.

'A female acquaintance described it as 'feeling like Superwoman for three days afterwards. Another close male friend said he was "swinging out of 
bed feeling immediately awake"'

'Vitamins are medically active compounds and, as such, can become toxic in high enough doses. If people are feeling tired or run down, they should be looking for answers on a dinner plate, not in an IV.'

The real deal?

After 45 minutes in a leather chair attached to a vitamin drip, I can honestly say I feel no different. To be fair, Sidhu-Robb recommends at least three or four infusions before you can expect to see significant effects, but that would involve a four figure sum - a cash injection I’m less willing to stomach.

Other celebs who have tried the trend include Rhianna (left) and Real House Wives of Atlanta star Kim zolciak Biermann (right)

Perhaps my vitamins were already 
balanced and my stress levels low - after all, I’d just returned from 
holiday. And there is certainly anecdotal evidence of dramatic success.

A female acquaintance described it as 'feeling like Superwoman' for three days afterwards.

Another close male friend tried one during a particularly stressful period and said he was 'swinging out of bed feeling immediately awake' each morning for six days.

Perhaps it’s the placebo effect, or perhaps both of them were significantly more run down or vitamin deficient than I was on that rainy Monday (according to The New York Times, as many as 30% of adults may be B12 deficient), but it’s certainly not a one-shot-suits-all treatment.

Leaving the clinic, I chat briefly to a woman called Faith, a vitamin-IV-junkie who I guess is in her mid-thirties.

'The infusions are fantastic,' she enthuses.

'They make you look and feel so young and healthy.'

Faith, it turns out, is 52. Suddenly, a few hundred pounds doesn’t look very expensive at all.

Women’s Health has just launched The Body 2014, its first ever nationwide search for a new magazine cover star.

From all corners of the country, Women’s Health is calling for the UK’s fittest women to step forward and prove they’ve got what it takes.
