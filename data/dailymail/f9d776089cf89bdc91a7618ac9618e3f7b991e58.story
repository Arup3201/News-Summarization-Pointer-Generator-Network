Missing: Len King, 74, went sailing yesterday on his 70ft yacht but failed to return to Brighton Marina

The wife of a 74-year-old businessman who remains missing from his luxury yacht has begged for his safe return as the Coastguard called off a major search.

Len King sailed his 70ft Sunseeker out of Brighton Marina yesterday and said he would be back for dinner with his wife Stephanie, 65, with whom he has run an engineering firm for more than 20 years.

But he failed to return, and a friend who saw the £750,000 vessel drifting empty by the harbour wall raised the alarm just before 10pm. 

Coastguard crews, lifeboats and a helicopter mounted a massive all-night search which took them as far as two and a half miles into the English Channel. 

They continued searching despite a thunderstorm which forced the helicopter to turn back until they were stood down just after 11am today.

Despite the search being suspended Mr King, from Alfriston, East Sussex, is still missing and his wife has made an emotional public appeal for his whereabouts.

She said she had tried to call him several times but could not get through to his phone.

'Len is an experienced yachtman and has been sailing since he was at least 20,' she added. 'Normally we go together but during the week if it's calm weather he may go off by himself.

'He went off just before lunch. I was expecting him home for dinner time.

'I phoned him several times but his phone was unable to connect so I thought he was on his way back. I called the person who has a boat next to us and he thought we were away.

'I can't understand what has happened. He is a very experienced yachtman. He has all his equipment doubled up and is always careful. That is the way he runs things.'

The pair run a successful precision engineering firm in Eastbourne, East Sussex, supplying specialist parts for medical, mining and aerospace machines.

Mr King is believed to have taken his luxury vessel sailing yesterday between Brighton and Newhaven, East Sussex,  the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said.

Brighton RNLI said fears grew when a crew member boarded the Sunseeker, found drifting on the inside of the eastern breakwater of Brighton Marina, and found no one on board.

That was despite the fact the instruments were still on and the engines were still warm.

The Coastguard said lifeboats searched 'in and out of every pontoon', the stretch of water between Newhaven and Shoreham, West Sussex, and as far out as 2.5 miles offshore.

Crews were stood down briefly at 5.30am but relaunched at 7am as it was getting light, the RNLI said.

Roger Cohen, Brighton RNLI lifeboat operations manager, said conditions for the volunteers overnight were 'challenging'.

'We had heavy rain with passing thunderstorms and fork lighting in Sussex throughout the night, making things even more challenging than they would normally be,' he added.

'At the moment this is something of a mystery - the Sunseeker was found within the eastern breakwater of the marina, banging up against the wall.

'When my crew boarded they found evidence it had recently been operated, but no sign of anyone.

Decision: A Coastguard spokesman said the search would be stood down unless there was further evidence

Brighton RNLI operations manager Roger Cohen (not pictured) added: 'We found no sign of anyone. Judging by the instruments and passage plans we found, the yachtsman appears to be skilled and experienced'

'Judging by the instruments and passage plans we found, the yachtsman appears to be skilled and experienced.'

An Coastguard spokesman said: 'Despite extensive searches, nothing has been found. Unless any new information comes to light, the search has been suspended.' 

Inspector Roy Apps of Sussex Police said: 'It is an anxious time for the family.

'The search is currently suspended and we are liaising with his family as we investigate the circumstances of his disappearance.

'An experienced seaman, Mr King had left Brighton Marina on his yacht on Sunday afternoon and it is unclear as to what has happened to him. 

'We are at an early stage of our investigation and we are liaising closely with Mr King's family while we make enquiries.'
