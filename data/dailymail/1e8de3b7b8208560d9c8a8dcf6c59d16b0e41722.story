A budget coach firm is to run a sleeper service linking London and Scotland – with each passenger given a free onesie to relax in.

A fleet of double-decker vehicles with seats that turn into bunk beds will operate between Victoria and 11 Scottish locations from £15 one way.

The Megabus services start this summer and will take less than eight hours to travel from London to Glasgow or Edinburgh.

Passengers will be able to unfold 
their seats into bunk beds and will be provided with free drinks, 
pillows, toothbrush, toothpaste, eye mask and a choice of all-in-one 
sleep suit or blanket.

Megabus owner Stagecoach has invested 
in a fleet of ten vehicles, each costing £500,000 and fitted with 53 
leather seats that convert into 42 bunks.

More than 1,700 beds will be available
 on services each week, linking London with Aberdeen, Aviemore, 
Cumbernauld, Dundee, Dunfermline, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Ferrytoll, 
Glasgow, Inverness and Perth.

Prices will range from £15 to £60 each
 way. Although the mode of travel may not appeal to everyone, Stagecoach
 boss Sir Brian Souter said: ‘It used to be just pop stars who had beds 
on board their tour buses, now everyone can benefit from a comfortable, 
great value overnight journey.’

The sleeper-coaches, specially 
designed and manufactured by Van Hool in Belgium, will operate under a 
new MegabusGold.com brand. 

However, even Stagecoach concedes overnight 
bus sleeper services are not that new.

Albatross Sleeping Car Co regularly 
took 12 passengers at a time between London and Liverpool in 1928 and 
Land Liners Ltd operated a double-decker night service between London 
and Manchester in the late 1920s.
