Mats Hummels' eagerly-anticipated move to Manchester United looks increasingly likely to happen after it emerged he made a promise to Sir Alex Ferguson three years ago.

As revealed by Sportsmail at the time, then-United manager Ferguson made a trip to Germany for the 2011-12 Cup final, in the hope of tying up an audacious triple transfer for Hummels, Robert Lewandowski and Shinji Kagawa.

In the event, he only managed to lure Kagawa to Old Trafford after Dortmund stood firm over their other two prized assets, in the wake of a stunning victory over Bayern Munich.

But sources in Germany have revealed a conversation took place between Ferguson and Hummels and that the Dortmund centre-back gave his word that, if he moved abroad, it would be to Old Trafford.

With the 26-year old now indicating he is ready to quit the Westfalenstadion at the end of a traumatic Bundesliga campaign for Dortmund, after years of remaining loyal to them, it confirms he is likely to become the cornerstone of a new-look United defence next season.

 

Dortmund will hold out for around £36million for their stylish defender but that will not stop Louis van Gaal pushing through a deal as part of another lavish spending spree this summer.
