Liam Ridgewell is set to join Wigan Athletic on loan from Portland Timbers for the next six weeks.

The former West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham and Aston Villa defender wants to use his break from the MLS to aid Malky Mackay’s struggles at the DW Stadium.

Mackay has lost five of his seven Championship games in charge of Wigan and also overseen their exit from the FA Cup to Bolton.

Wigan are hopeful the deal can be signed off by Portland in time for Ridgewell to play in Saturday’s match at Birmingham as the side attempt to improve on their 23rd place in the table.

The loan deal is expected to run until the middle of February, when Ridgewell will head back to the United States for the start of the coming MLS season. 

The 30-year-old has made 15 appearances for the MLS side since arriving on a free transfer in the summer.
