You'll never think of mittens in the same way after looking at these pictures of the mashed-up mammals.

One cute ginger critter sits on a rock staring up with his beautiful blue eyes with his tail curled underneath him.

Another channels its inner Gollum by bearing its baby-teeth while being held in a human's hand.

'Mittens' area mash up of cute kittens and monkeys, which are created by photoshopping the animals

Serial hybrid animal creator Sarah Lee DeRememer came up with the idea after loving the wordplay on the combination of the two species.

The 25-year-old from Los Angeles said: 'Mittens are warm and fuzzy as are these hybrids in my opinion.

'The feedback I've had is that most of them are cute, although some aren't.

'When someone reads 'a Collection of Mittens', they're not expecting it to be hybrid animals rather than hand warmers.

Sarah, 25 said that mittens are 'warm and fuzzy' -  and she feels that her hybrid animals are too

'They are both very easy to relate to - monkeys because people are so closely related, and kittens because they're household pets.' 

Sarah started making hybrid animals as a way to improve her Photoshop skills.

Each takes up to four hours to complete and Sarah works with 20 layers on the picture to make the combinations seamless.

The bizarre creatures have attracted various opinions - with people unable to decide if they are cute or creepy
