At least three major Tory donors have been hired by David Cameron to help determine Government policy - while a fourth profited from the conflict in Libya

At least three major Tory donors have been hired by David Cameron to help determine Government policy – while a fourth profited from the conflict in Libya.

The disclosures raise serious concerns that wealthy businessmen are being given privileged access to the heart of the No. 10 machine after signing hefty cheques for the Tories.

Last night Stanley Fink, who has been reappointed treasurer, sent an urgent letter to donors making clear that in future ministers will have to seek permission before using policy ideas put forward by donors.

‘If any ministerial contact with a party donor prompts a request for policy advice, the minister will refer this to his or her private office who can seek guidance from the Permanent Secretary,’ he wrote.

JCB boss Sir Anthony Bamford was granted a ‘Thank you dinner’ by the Prime Minister and his party co- chairman Andrew Feldman in July 2010  in No. 10 two months after the general election.

Sir Anthony, who has given more than £1.8million to the Tories since Mr Cameron became leader, was later asked to write a Government report on the future of manufacturing.

Another dinner, this time in the Camerons’ private flat above 11 Downing Street, was held in November last year for Ian Taylor, the world’s biggest oil trader, who has given the Tories £466,000.

Two months earlier, it had emerged that his company Vitol supplied oil to the rebels in Libya – a contract worth more than £100million.

That deal was arranged by a secret oil cell in the Foreign Office set up by International Development Minister Alan Duncan, who had previously acted as a consultant to Vitol.

Lord Ashcroft, who is Mr Cameron's most generous donor, having handed over £4.3million, was entertained at the Prime Minister's official country residence of Chequers in June 2010.

Venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft was also asked to contribute to policy on the future of employment rights in the UK.

Mr Beecroft, who has given £593,000 to the Tories since 2005, drew up controversial recommendations to allow bosses to ‘fire at will’, removing lazy and ineffectual staff, as well as changing rules on unfair dismissal to remove the burdens of tribunal cases on business.

His report was championed in Downing Street by David Cameron’s chief policy guru Steve Hilton – though it was suppressed after disagreements with the Liberal Democrats.

Sir Anthony Bamford’s report appears to have had more influence.

He called on the Government to become champions of manufacturing and cut business taxes to support a renaissance in engineering – both of which could have benefited his company JCB.

The Chancellor made cutting Corporation Tax a centrepiece of his Budget last week.

Meanwhile Lord Ashcroft, who is Mr Cameron’s most generous donor, having handed over £4.3million, was entertained at the Prime Minister’s official country residence of Chequers in June 2010.

A year later he was asked to head a review of the Ministry of Defence’s overseas bases.

Critics believe he was also influential in persuading the Government to build a new runway on the remote island of St Helena – a £100million project of which he was the most vocal backer.

It also emerged yesterday that former Tory treasurer Michael Spencer claimed that he knew in advance that the Government would veto French plans for a financial transactions tax.

In an interview for financial magazine Risk, Mr Spencer said: ‘I have had it first-hand from very, very senior members of our administration who I know personally and have had good relations with for a long time, that it will be vetoed without any doubt and without any reservation at all.’

Details of activities undertaken by donors are significant because they suggest high-level links between party backers and politicians can lead to influence over or prior knowledge of policy.

The disgraced former Tory treasurer Peter Cruddas was recorded by undercover reporters saying one donor had written a paper on the subject of gay marriage for the No. 10 policy unit.

He said: ‘We’ve fed that back into the party and there are some brilliant points in it and his voice has been heard.

‘If you’re unhappy about something, we will listen to you and put it into the policy committee at No. 10 – we feed all feedback to the policy committee.’

Mr Cameron’s spokesman said officials could find no trace of such a paper, saying: ‘I’ve spoken to the policy unit and the Prime Minister. This claim appears to have been entirely made up.’

The spokesman denied that there had been discussion of Government policy but admitted: ‘Of course there is going to be talk about politics in generic terms.’ 

Lord Fink, 54, who was made a life peer last year after a two-year stint as treasurer, was brought back because, unlike Peter Cruddas, he is seen as a safe pair of hands

The latest businessman to accept the poisoned chalice of the Tory treasurer’s role was once memorably spotted crawling on his hands and knees at the edge of a golf course lake trying to retrieve a ball which had plopped into the water.

Considering Stanley Fink’s personal fortune is estimated at £118million, it might seem odd behaviour. But with donations drying up from grassroot members who are disillusioned with David Cameron’s leadership, a frugal approach may be what is required at Tory Party HQ.

Fink, 54, who was made a life peer last year after a two-year stint as treasurer, was brought back because, unlike Peter Cruddas, he is seen as a safe pair of hands. He is discreet, well-liked by other Tory donors, and there has never been a hint of scandal about his business career.

In his heyday in the City he was known as the ‘Godfather’ of British hedge funds, having transformed the Man Group over two decades into the world’s biggest listed hedge-fund group with assets of U.S. $88billion.

He lessened his involvement in 2005, after a brain tumour was diagnosed and eventually stood down entirely, but returned to the City with another business venture in 2008. Putting political affiliations aside, he set up International Standard Asset Management, a small commodities trader, with the man who had been Tony Blair’s personal fundraiser, Lord ‘Cashpoint’ Levy.

Fink is from a modest background. He was brought up in Manchester and went to Manchester Grammar School. His father was a grocer, one of his brothers trades computer parts from a garage, and the other one is a middle-manager for a car windscreen company.

He has three children and met his wife Barbara 25 years ago in an old people’s home where they were both doing voluntary work.

‘In my case it was love at first sight but it was not for her. It took about six months before I plucked up the courage to ask her out,’ he said in an interview.

He read law at Cambridge and his first job was as a trainee accountant with Arthur Andersen. A cerebral figure, he first became Tory treasurer after bankrolling Boris Johnson’s successful London mayoral campaign in 2008.

He has given about £2.5million to the Conservative Party and has dined with the Prime Minister at Chequers. But it was as a student that he first became committed to the Tory cause.

He was working in a paper factory in Bury, where he developed a new method of generating more orders. After a couple of days he was taken aside by a trade union shop steward and told this was ‘very unhelpful because he had people who weren’t able to pick orders at quite the same rate’. Fink recalled: ‘I remember thinking that was a great shame because clearly my way was better for the company. I saw a negative side of trade unions. I think that hardened my views.’

He enjoys the trappings of his success. He has a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, and a large family house in Northwood, Middlesex. He owns a chalet in the ski resort of Courchevel in France plus the luxurious hotel next door.

‘It is attached to my chalet so I get all the hotel services,’ he says. ‘It is the best of both worlds, having a private house with a Michelin chef. I go to the hotel bar and use the pool and the gym. I often go skiing with a couple of families. I like to share my good fortune with my old friends.’

With the latest scandal over funding, it could well be that Fink will have to share even more of his good fortune with the Tory Party.
