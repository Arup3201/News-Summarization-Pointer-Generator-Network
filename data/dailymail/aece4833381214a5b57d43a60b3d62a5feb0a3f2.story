Quarterback for the New York Jets Geno Smith was on a Virgin America plane from Los Angeles bound for Fort Lauderdale Friday but never left the ground after a dispute with a flight attendant.

According to multiple sources, the quarterback had an argument with a flight attendant over his headphones that culminated in his leaving the flight and being questioned by police at the gate.

One Twitter user tweeted that Smith was spotted yelling at Virgin America staff members and being escorted off the flight by police.

Airport altercation: Reports differ but Geno Smith did speak to police at the airport then leave without leaving the ground yesterday in LA

The Associated Press reports that another witness says Smith got up from his seat and asked to speak to a supervisor before leaving the plane of his own accord and speaking with police at the gate before leaving.

According to ESPN the incident began when a flight attendant asked Smith to remove his headphones and switch off all electronic devices.

Smith didn't immediately respond because he didn't hear the request.

Police involvement: Smith was pictured speaking to police at the airport but no arrest was made

The flight attendant unplugged Smith's headphones and 'threw them down,' telling the quarterback he was a 'threat' and asking him to leave the plane, according to the source. Smith asked to speak with police, the person added.

The New York Daily News reports that Smith was kicked off the flight after he refused to get off his cell phone after being asked by airline staff three times.

Yet another report, recounted to Deadspin by yet another witness, tells a different story of Smith's police encounter that could be an entirely separate incident to the one that happened after boarding.

'We were waiting for our flight at LAX to Vegas and were put on standby on Virgin American just like Geno. We were told to get seat assignment at 2:40. Apparently Geno was not on board with that. My friend walked over to discuss seat assignment and Geno was saying to airline ticket agents, "F***that, this is bulls***." "Why the f*** do I have to wait until 2:40." He would not let it go. He continued to curse and be loud for about 5 minutes. Police were called. They talked for a few minutes and then 3 officers escorted him out of the terminal.'

TMZ accosted the quarterback, who just finished his rookie season with the Jets, at the airport, where he denied the reports that he had been kicked off the flight.

'Don’t believe that,' he said. The TMZ reporter mentioned that he seemed calm, to which Smith responded, 'Always.'

The New York Daily News spoke to Sergeant Belinda Nettles with Los Angeles World Airports who said, 'I can’t confirm any names or anything because there were no arrests made. But we did respond to a call, and the subject involved was questioned and released.

'We responded to an incident. When we arrived, the person was already off the aircraft,' she said.
