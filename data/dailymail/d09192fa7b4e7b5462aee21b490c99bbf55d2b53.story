An easyJet flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Amsterdam after smoke was reported in the cockpit.

The Airbus A320 was flying from Berlin to Bristol when it turned around over the North Sea and diverted to Schiphol airport.

An easyJet spokeswoman confirmed that the pilot had reported smoke in the cockpit and passengers on board flight EZY6238 also reported the smell of smoke in the cabin.

The Luton-based airline described it as ‘a technical issue’.

Passengers said the plane was met by emergency services when it landed safely last night, and no evacuation was required.

A passenger named Charlotte tweeted a photo of firefighters entering the cockpit, saying: ‘Well that went badly’.

After the plane was inspected by a fire crew passengers disembarked normally and waited inside the terminal for about two hours until a new plane arrived to transport them to Bristol early this morning.

Passenger Ellen Braksator wrote on Twitter: ‘We're all okay, there was a strong smell of smoke on flightdeck and emergency landed in Schiphol. No panic.’

Another passenger, Nick Canham, wrote that a ‘strong burning chemical smell’ was detected on board.

He later tweeted photos of passengers waiting inside the terminal, where they were sat on the floor due to limited seating, and complained that they were not offered refreshments.

‘Passengers are currently being cared for while their onward travel to Bristol is being arranged.’
