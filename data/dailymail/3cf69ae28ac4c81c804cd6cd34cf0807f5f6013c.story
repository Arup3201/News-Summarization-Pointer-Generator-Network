At 11 weeks old, this kitten has had enough drama to last him nine lives.

After apparently wandering off from his owners, the ginger pet ended up being shot in the head by thugs.

When he was found in a garden, he was starving and at death’s door.

Remarkably, however, the kitten –  named
 Ron after Harry Potter’s ginger-haired friend Ron Weasley – is now on 
the road to recovery thanks to a local vet.

Safe: Ron is being cared for by foster owner Julie McManus, who has appealed for his owners to come forward

A 5mm airgun pellet had narrowly missed his eye and is still lodged in his neck.

Clare Sutton, of Priory Vets in Driffield, East Yorkshire, said: ‘If it had been a centimetre either way it could have been a lot worse.

‘The pellet could have hit his eye or the soft tissue close to his brain. He’s very lucky that it didn’t cause any long-term damage.

‘When he was brought in, he was in a bad way – very thin, because he hadn’t eaten in quite a few days.

'We examined his mouth and found a wound and found the hole next to his eye and worked out that he had been shot.

‘We could feel there was a lump under
 his chin, which is probably the pellet and inflammation, but decided 
that he was too young to operate on and because it wasn’t causing him 
any trouble at the moment, we could wait until he was a bit older.

‘We syringe-fed him and the next day he was a lot better, even quite playful. He’s a lovely little thing.’

Rita
 Bailey, cat re-homing coordinator at the RSPCA’s Bridlington, Driffield
 and District branch, said: ‘It’s dreadful. I didn’t think he would 
survive it.

‘I can’t 
understand how anyone can shoot a baby animal. I can’t get my head 
around it, but at least he is safe now and will be getting lots of 
tender loving care.’

Ron is now recuperating with foster carer Julie McManus and will be offered for adoption if his owners fail to come forward.

She
 said: ‘He’s doing brilliantly now. He is the most loving kitten you 
could ever meet, he loves to be fussed over and purrs his head off.

‘He doesn’t appear to be in any pain, which is great considering what happened to him. You couldn’t print what I want to say about the people who did it.’
