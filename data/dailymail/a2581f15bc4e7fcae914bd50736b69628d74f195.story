The location was unremarkable, a small theatre in UEFA’s headquarters in the Swiss town of Nyon. And the ceremony was admirably understated, with dear old Luis Figo indolently fishing plastic balls from a Perspex bowl. Yet the tension was undeniable, because they were making the draw for the quarter-finals of the Champions League. And the thrill felt strangely familiar.

Some of us recognised that feeling from a hundred similar ceremonies involving plastic balls and coded numbers. We remember those dry, bloodless tones, informing us that ‘Number 38, Hartlepool United, will play Number 3, Arsenal.’ And we imagined the whoops and yells breaking out in the Hartlepool dressing room.

They were the days when the FA Cup occupied a central place in the English season, when footballers and fans alike would speak of Wembley as if it were Valhalla.

A small experiment may demonstrate the current status of the competition. Ask a selection of keen football followers to recite that European quarter-final draw. There will be some hesitation, the odd mistake, but such is the status of the clubs involved that most fans would readily supply chapter and verse.

Now ask those same fans to detail the draw for the semi-finals of the FA Cup. I suggest that many would struggle to come up with Wigan Athletic v Arsenal and Sheffield United v Hull City. For it is now a contest of small consequence, an event which barely registers on the nation’s radar.

The FA Cup has become a competition which makes shifty evaders of upright managers: ‘You want to know why we’re putting out our third team? Well, our striker’s hamstring has tweaked, our winger’s grandmother has expired, and the work experience kid’s in goal on account of the virus which wiped out all our other keepers. Thankfully, they’ll all be fit for next week, apart, of course, from the winger’s grannie.’

It is what we have come to, yet it 
does not have to be like that. With a single, modest adjustment, the Cup
 could regain its central place on our sporting stage. Quite simply, the
 winners of the FA Cup should automatically qualify for one of England’s
 four places in the Champions League. The idea is not original but the 
alarming decline of the competition lends it a desperate urgency.

At
 the moment, the Cup winners are rewarded with a place in the group 
stage of the Europa League, which is rather like winning the Lottery and
 sharing the prize with half a million other lucky punters. But a 
guaranteed place in the Champions League, with all that entails in terms
 of finance and status, is a different matter. Overnight, treatment 
tables would empty, excuses would evaporate and football managers would 
start to tell the truth. In short, the FA Cup would come roaring back to
 life.

Naturally, there is a
 snag, and that snag is called the Premier League. Suggest to almost any
 of the club chairmen that they should voluntarily cede a Champions 
League place and their indignation would be wondrous to behold. For 
Europe is the place where profits are measured in multiples of millions.

The prospect of Europe, however remote for some, is the carrot which enticed them to join their 20-club cabal in the first place. And yet, from time to time, this self-serving gang need reminding that the game is not merely a vehicle for their profits or their profile. The FA Cup existed and flourished long before they invested a single dollar, dinar or rouble, and if the task of restoring it to its proper place should cause them some slight financial inconvenience, then so be it.

Clearly, the people who ought to be fighting this cause are those entrusted with the welfare of the FA Cup competition. But the FA’s record of standing up to the Premier League is not impressive. As the body responsible for the governance of English football, the FA had the power to shape football’s future when the League was formed in 1992. Tragically, they lacked the vision to dictate intelligent terms. Today, they appear to lack both the clout and courage to take on the men with the money.

And yet, the stakes are genuinely important. In itself, the act of prising a European place from the hands of the Premier League could be seen as little more than a political manoeuvre. But the practical effects would be enormous.

Europe's elite? Arsenal have not won a trophy since 2005 yet have qualified for the Champions League every year

Over the past five seasons, the fourth-placed Premier League team have finished 18, 16, 12, 20 and 16 points — an average of 16.4 points — behind the winners.

Fourth place in the Olympics, no matter how close to the winner you are, does not get you on the podium. Fourth place in a Parliamentary election usually means a lost deposit. And yet, in modern English football, such a trifling achievement offers an entry into the European elite. 

It is totally illogical and demonstrably unjust, and the FA must find the nerve to say so.

For 142 years, their trophy has found a fond place in the heart of our game. They have a duty to preserve its power and its glory.

Time to turn a deaf ear to F1's big noises

Motor racing has been attempting to civilise the fuel-guzzling, air-polluting affront to the environment that is Formula One.

Engine manufacturers insisted that F1’s technology needs to be more relevant to their road car programmes. They, therefore, voted to switch from V8 engines to the quieter, greener V6 turbo. This, it appears, puts a far greater premium on driving skill and also allows the cheers of the crowd to be heard, something which was impossible with the ear-splitting V8s.

We imagined that this enlightened move would meet with universal approval. Not at all. Bernie Ecclestone, the famously feisty chief executive of F1, declared himself ‘horrified’ by the change. Not loud enough, apparently; certainly not as loud as, say, the slipstream of a Boeing 747. As Bernie put it: ‘These cars don’t sound like racing cars.’ So he wants to make them a great deal louder.

Bring the noise: F1 supremo bernie Ecclestone has criticised the new regulations on the sport

But if this may be passed off as the harmless eccentricity of an 83-year-old billionaire, then what to make of Andrew Westacott, who enjoys the title of ‘Australian Grand Prix Corporation Chief Executive’. He believed that the new rules detract from the ‘sexiness’ of the event. He complained that he did not need earplugs.

Finally, he described the noise in the pit lane as being like ‘harpsichords in a chamber orchestra’. I note that the Melbourne Chamber Orchestra are performing Vivaldi’s Four Seasons on Wednesday evening. If our Andrew is correct, it may be well worth a visit.

But we should not take him seriously, any more than we should indulge Ecclestone’s yearning for deafening decibels.

Instead, we should hope that the reformers stick to their guns. And that all the absurd objections are drowned in the roar of the crowd.

Some of the best lines in sport were uttered by boxers before a fight. From the dazzling soliloquies of Muhammad Ali, to the first man who ever said ‘The bigger they are, the harder they fall’, to that marvellously wry remark of Joe Louis: ‘He can run but he can’t hide.’ Tyson Fury has a mundane scuffle coming up, against somebody whose name escapes me. Sadly, droll witticisms are not Mr Fury’s style. So he made his point by standing up, turning over a table, and stomping out. Clearly, we are in for a feast of Wildean wit before the first blows are struck.

PS

Since we are not slow to criticise our football authorities, we must offer praise where it’s due. The FA have decided to mark the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster by delaying the kick-offs of all Premier League, Football League and Conference matches by seven minutes. The same delay will apply to both FA Cup semi-finals, reminding us that the Liverpool-Nottingham Forest semi-final of 1989 was ended six minutes after kick-off as the extent of the crowd tragedy became apparent. The gesture is poignant, sensitive and admirably inspired.
