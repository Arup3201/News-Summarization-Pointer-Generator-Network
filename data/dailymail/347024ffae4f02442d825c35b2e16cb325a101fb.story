David Cameron dropped plans to put a cap on the number of EU immigrants allowed into Britain after being ‘sat on’ by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a former minister said today.

The Prime Minister announced last week that he would ban migrants from claiming benefits for four years after moving to Britain. But he failed to include a controversial ‘emergency break’ on migration if the benefit cuts did not lead to a fall in the number of EU workers moving to the UK.

Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson today said he did not think Mr Cameron could ‘deliver’ even his watered-down pledge. He said: ‘It looks as if we’ve already been sat on by the Germans.’

In a further blow to Mr Cameron – just days after his set-piece immigration speech – leading Eurosceptic Tories will now table a bill on Wednesday to override the EU’s principle of free movement of workers.

It comes amid claims 200 Tory MPs want to leave the European Union. Tory veteran Sir Bill Cash has warned that at least two thirds of the 303 Conservatives in the Commons now want to leave.

Mr Paterson – a leading Tory favouring Britain’s exit from the EU – told the Prime Minister he had to ‘deliver’ on his promise to cut benefits for migrants.

He added: ‘It’s quite clearly impossible for a country like ours to absorb 260,000 new immigrants net every year, it’s putting a terrible strain on public services and causing real social problems.’

‘This is a real pressing problem. We cannot go into long, rambling negotiations with the European Union, particularly if they’re not going to play ball.’

He described the current situation as a ‘fork in the road’.

It comes amid claims that Britain could be forced to pay benefits to even more migrants despite Mr Cameron’s speech.

Officials in Brussels last night confirmed that the European Commission is taking legal action to make Britain lift existing restrictions that prevent some migrants claiming child benefit and child tax credit in the UK.

The news comes just days after David Cameron pledged to cut handouts in a bid to reduce soaring immigration.

The case at Europe’s highest court will further anger the public and politicians who have called on the Government to tighten up Britain’s generous welfare system and make the country a less attractive destination for would-be immigrants.

If Britain loses, it will either have to change the law to allow jobless migrant families to claim child benefit, or face paying millions in fines.

Latest figures show 24,000 families are currently claiming child benefit of at least £89 a month for 38,500 children living abroad, at an estimated cost of £30 million a year, while 4,000 claim child tax credit.

On Friday, the Prime Minister pledged to end the ‘exporting’ of child benefit, as well as to ban migrant workers from claiming tax credits until they have worked in the UK for four years.

Last night Nigel Mills, one of the Conservative backbenchers demanding a tough limit on EU migrants, said: ‘Free movement is about the right to work, not the right to claim benefits. The EU should accept our rules are the will of the British people and Parliament.
