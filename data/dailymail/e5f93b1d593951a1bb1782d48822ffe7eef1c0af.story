President Barack Obama is planning for the possibility of launching a unilateral American military action against Syria within days after Britain opted out in a stunning vote by Parliament.

Facing skepticism at home, administration officials spoke with a group of lawmakers for more than 90 minutes Thursday evening to explain why they believe Bashar Assad's government was the culprit in a suspected chemical attack last week.

Afterward, the House Democratic leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, pointedly sided with Republican Speaker John Boehner of Ohio in urging the administration to do more to engage with Congress on the matter.

She said the administration needs to 
consult more with 'all members of Congress' – a reference to the limited
circle briefed Thursday night – and provide 'additional transparency 
into the decision-making process.'

Strain: David Cameron's failure to secure UK backing for President Barack Obama's intervention in Syria threatens the special relationship

Despite
roadblocks in forming an international coalition, Obama appeared 
undeterred and advisers said he would be willing to retaliate against 
Syria on his own.

'The 
president of the United States is elected with the duty to protect the 
national security interests in the United States of America,' White 
House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

Half of Americans say they oppose taking military action against Syria and nearly 80 percent believe Obama should seek congressional approval before using any force, according to a new NBC poll.

After the vote in Parliament Thursday, Britain’s
‘special relationship’ with the United States is under threat, 
David Cameron has been warned.

Urgent
calls were made to the White House last night soon after the government
defeat amid claims by one Whitehall official that Britain had ‘handed 
back its deputy sheriff badge.'

Chancellor
George Osborne warned Britain must undertake ‘national soul-searching’ 
about its place in the world as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned 
the special relationship was now under ‘strain’.

Diplomatic experts also voiced deep concerns that the repercussions for Britain’s standing on the world stage would be long-lasting.

The Henry Jackson Society said last night's Commons vote has damaged Britain's reputation as a major global power and also sent a worrying message to dictators, while the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was an embarrassment.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown said the defeat in the Commons had left the UK a ‘hugely diminished country’.

The influential Tory grassroots website ConservativeHome said Mr Cameron had suffered 'the worst foreign policy defeat in modern times'.

Mr Cameron had promised Mr Obama he would stand should to shoulder with the US in taking military action against the Assad regime after the devastating chemical weapons attack in Damascus last week.

To add further embarrassment, French president Francois Hollande said his country was prepared to stand alongside America and 'punish' Syrian leader Bashar Assad.

He said: ‘The chemical massacre at 
Damascus cannot and must not remain unpunished. Otherwise, we take the 
risk of an escalation that would normalise the use of these weapons, and
threaten other countries.

'Each country is free to choose whether to take part in such an operation or not. That holds true for Britain and France.'

Prime Minister David Cameron recalled Parliament to stage an emergency vote to endorse UK involvement in missile strikes.

But MPs voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject Mr Cameron’s motion backing British intervention in principle.

It is the first time that Parliament has voted against the government on a matter of war and peace since 1782, and raises the prospect of the US having to go it alone.

Mr Hammond said: ‘It’s certainly going to place some strain on the special relationship.’

He said the Americans ‘have been surprised by the scale of opposition in Parliament, and perhaps they will struggle a bit to understand the very special reasons that there are for that view in Parliament’.

Downing Street sources stressed that there had been ‘understanding’ from the White House about the outcome of the vote.

But there was acknowledgement that it permanently altered the assumption that Britain and the US would act together in military operations around the world.

Chancellor Mr Osborne insisted the relationship with the US is a ‘very old one, very deep and operates on many layers’ and there had been 'a bit of hyperbole' about the impact of the vote.

But he suggested the UK was now at a crucial crossroads in deciding the role it plays in global politics.

‘I think there will be a national soul-searching about our role in the world and whether Britain wants to play a big part in upholding the international system, be that big open and trading nation that I'd like us to be or whether we turn our back on that,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘I understand the deep scepticism that my colleagues in Parliament many members of the public have about British involvement in Syria.

‘I hope this doesn’t become the moment where we turn our back on the world’s problems.’

Ally: US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters during a visit to the Philippines that America would still consult Britain

White House officials cautiously suggested Mr Obama was prepared to launch strikes against Syria without British support.

But asked if the US would go it alone, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: ‘The opinion of others in this situation matters.’

US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said America still wanted to secure international backing for any military intervention.

Speaking during a trip to the Philippines, he said: 'It is the goal of President Obama and our government ... whatever decision is taken, that it be an international collaboration and effort.

'Our approach is to continue to find an international coalition that will act together. And I think you're seeing a number of countries state, publicly state, their position on the use of chemical weapons.'

But Robin Wright, a Middle East analyst for the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Centre, told The Times that the vote ‘complicates life and this has bigger implications about the nature of the relationship between the United States and its closest ally’.

Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of the trans-Atlantic think tank the Henry Jackson Society, said: ‘If not reversed, this vote means the UK will join the rank of third-rate nations, condemned to be the prisoner of events and with no power to shape them.

‘This is a shameful result which will not be readily forgotten by our allies. We can be certain that more atrocities will follow in Syria.’

RUSI director general Professor Michael Clarke said the decision not to go ahead with military intervention would prove an embarrassment for Britain on the international stage.

Lord Ashdown, who appeared in front of Lib Dem MPs with leader Nick Clegg yesterday in an attempt to persuade rebels to back the government, wrote on Twitter: ‘In 50 years trying to serve my country I have never felt so depressed/ashamed. Britain's answer to the Syrian horrors? none of our business!’

Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted that the UK-US relationship 'remains strong' despite last night's vote.

He said: 'I do think there's a lesson for Britain, though, which is that we must lead in the right way for Britain from our national interest and indeed our global interest.

'Now sometimes that will mean agreeing with what America is doing and the way it's going about things, and sometimes it will mean doing things in a different way.'
