Nike has issued an apology for the glaring error on a line of Carolina Panthers t-shirts.

While the team colors were right, and the Panther logo was correct, they were paired with the wrong state.

Instead of North Carolina, the t-shirts featured the unmistakable shape of South Carolina along with the letters ‘NC.’

State of Confusion: Sports apparel giant Nike recently dropped the ball when it offered a Carolina Panthers shirt that mixed up South Carolina and North Carolina

Those, of course, are the initials for North Carolina. And though the Carolina Panthers name is meant to invoke both states, the team plays home game at Bank of America in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The shirt sold for $32, but was soon taken down from the company's web store.

The error was first reported on the sports blog of Charlotte Observer columnist Scott Fowler, called Scott Says.

It was caught, Fowler wrote, by eagle-eyed Charlotte resident Les Hall, who then decided to buy the shirt for a laugh.

After Fowler’s post and subsequent story in the Observer, which were followed by a flurry of reports of the embarrassing mistake on websites and social media across the web, Nike responded.

‘A small quantity of incorrect Carolina Panthers tee shirts were recently made available for sale,’ wrote a spokesperson Brian Strong. ‘This product should not have been sold. We have removed it from sale and apologize for the error.’

How many shirts, exactly, were sold and how many were made at all remains unclear.

As Fowler notes, Hall now likely has a collector's item on his hands, one worth well over the $32 he paid.
