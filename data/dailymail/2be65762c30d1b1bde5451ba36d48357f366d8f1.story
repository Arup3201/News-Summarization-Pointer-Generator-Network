An anti-abortion campaigner has been attacked for running a controversial message on Facebook during the AFL Grand Final on Saturday. 

The message came from Fred Nile, the head of the Official Christian Democratic Party. It features a picture of the Melbourne Cricket Grounds stadium people with the following message:

’90,000 babies were aborted since the last AFL Grand Final. They will never see a footy match. Christian Democratic Party-vote pro-life and help save lives.’ 

Nile is the longest serving politician in NSW, with a career in parliament spanning over 33 years.

He is strongly homophobic and anti-abortion in his policies.

Last year, Niles introduced first bill of Zoe's Law, which is named an incident where a pregnant woman lost her unborn child after being hit by an intoxicated car driver.

The bill seeks to achieve legislative recognition of foetuses as living persons, separate from their mothers. It has a blanket sentencing of 10 years.

He is still campaigning to have the law introduced. He told Daily Mail the bill is still on the cards.

Jacinda Woodhead, a pro-abortion activist, says Nile 'represents an extreme fringe minority opinion in Australia'

 'Zoe's Law successfully passed the Lower House of Parliament, and it is being discussed among members of the Upper House.'

Mr Nile said the AFL post was 'Intended to raise awareness as to the scale of abortions. 90,000 a year is a huge loss of life.'

Pro-abortion activists have condemned the message.

Jacinda Woodhead, a pro-choice campaigner who is currently completing a PhD project about abortion in Australia, told Daily Mail ‘Fred Nile represents an extreme fringe minority opinion in Australia.

'Frankly, his outlandish provocations are not unexpected from a man who is perpetually trying to turn Australia – a secular country – into a Christian nation, one with particularly puritanical views on women and their bodies.’

‘As his presentation at the recent World Congress of Families illustrates, Fred Nile thinks the Devil controls gay people, single mothers, women more generally, and welfare – the thing a society provides so the most vulnerable are protected, and can continue to live and thrive,’ she said.

‘The anti-choice movement supports Fred Nile’s Christian theocratic identity because of his opposition to abortion and gay rights, but the rest of Australia moved on from these debates long ago.'
