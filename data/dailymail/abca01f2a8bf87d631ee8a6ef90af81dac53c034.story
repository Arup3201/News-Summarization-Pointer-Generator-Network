A four-month-old baby died in hospital on Saturday after being left in a car in the parking lot of a San Diego apartment block.

Police received calls from concerned residents about a baby left unattended in a car in the parking lot of the Belle Vista apartment block in the 500 block of North Mollison Ave in El Cajon around 1:30pm.

Officials arrived and found the baby boy unresponsive. CPR was performed on the child at the scene before he was transported to Sharp Grossmont Hospital where he later died.

According to Belle Vista resident Larry Singleton, a group of children noticed the baby in the car and ran to tell him as he headed out to the grocery store.

'It hurts me to know that someone's baby passed away. It’s really sad,' said Singleton, who was one of several residents who called 911 about the child.

He said the parents were new to the building.

San Diego 6 reports that witnesses said the parents arrived home in the car and went inside the building, leaving the baby in the vehicle.

Some witnesses said the child had been in the car for 30 minutes, while others estimated it had been six hours before the baby was discovered missing.

Police Lieutenant Eric Taylor said the parents, aged in their 20s, were being interviewed about the death.

'We’re conducting an investigation to determine whether it was an accident,' Taylor told NBC.

Taylor said the couple had other children, who were being cared for by family members.

The temperature in El Cajon on Saturday reached a high of 85 degrees. It's unclear whether the baby died of heat related causes or exactly how long he was left unattended in the car.

'Any time we have warm weather it’s a danger to infants, children, pets and the elderly,' Taylor told UT San Diego.
