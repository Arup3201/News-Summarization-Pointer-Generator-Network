My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson has been at the centre of controversy this week, after claims from his ex-wife that  he's a 'deadbeat dad' who doesn't see or support his kids.

Cindy Anderson told A Current Affair on Monday that the reality show contestant owed close to $40,000 in child support for their five children.

Now it seems the wannabe chef may be forced to dish out the dosh from his estimated $1,000 a week MKR salary, along with a portion of any winnings, should he and new wife Carol Molloy take away the $250,000 first place prize.

Dishing out the dosh? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson could be made to pay a portion of his estimated $1,000 a week reality TV show wages and any prize money towards child support owing to his kids

Maria Monastiriotis, the head of Slater and Gordon's family law department in Sydney told Fairfax Media on Wednesday that any income received from the show that is taxable will be assessable in terms of his child support.

'Indeed, if there are any arrears in child support, that money can be earmarked towards those arrears,' Maria told the publication.

'The Department of Human Services also has the power to request that Channel Seven [or the producers] pay that money directly to them by something called a "garnishee order",' she added.

Cindy claims she had sent producers a letter in January for that purpose, however Channel Seven say they never received her letter.

'Deadbeat dad'? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson's ex-wife claimed he owes close to $40,000 in child support for their children, saying he's 'pretty much wiped his hands' of them

Another income? Family law expert Maria Monastiriotis told Fairfax Media on Wednesday that Adam's appearance and any winnings on the show could be taxable and therefore could be garnished to pay arrears

Channel Seven also refused to confirm or deny the estimated $1,000 weekly salary given to contestants, which was revealed by a former MKR contestant to Fairfax Media.

'We don't comment on our contest agreements,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 

The former reality TV personality is understood to have told the publication, that in the past some contestants have avoided paying tax on their MKR earnings by claiming their time on the show was a "hobby", as opposed to a job.

It's also unclear if the quarter of a million dollars prize money is taxable.

However, Maria says regardless of taxable income, Cindy has the right to make a 'change of assessment' application to the child support agency if Adam's financial circumstances change significantly, such as winning the prize money. 

In the explosive interview, Cindy also claimed that her ex is friends with one of the show's judges, Pete Evans - coaching him on the court as well as working at Pete's Kings Cross restaurant Hugo's, in Sydney, after the couple's separation.

Owing child support: Cindy Anderson made the explosive claims on A Current Affair on Monday night

Adam's former wife of almost 20 years, told A Current Affair on Monday night that she was speaking out on the show instead of dealing with the matter privately because, 'He has blocked my number and both his childrens' numbers - the older two girls have phones'.

Adam's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married Carol Molloy - his partner on the Channel 7 reality show - but she claims that's when her issues with child support payments began. 

A Channel Seven spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia in response to Cindy's claims: 'This is a private matter between the parties involved.' 

Channel Seven also refuted the assertion, that Adam and Pete are friends: 'They [Adam and Pete] met for the first time on the program'.

Ranging in age: Their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age

'He has known Pete Evans, he knows him through tennis, through coaching him,' Cindy told reporter Brady Halls. 

'We get no financial support at all,' she also told Brady.

Cindy claims her concern is  that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year, which she says 'worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father.'

'The children also have no emotional support from him. He does not ring them, nor come and see them,' she said, adding 'they do not receive a card [for birthdays] in the mail, not even a phone call.'

'He's never played an active, massive role in their lives anyway...but basically his role now is non-existent, he's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children,' Cindy said.

Upset: The blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after Adam's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters

The blonde single mother also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it's 'significantly impacting on the children'.

Cindy not only took aim at Adam during the interview but also at the Child Support Agency and producers of My Kitchen Rules.

'It seems there is little they [child support agency] can do, irrespective of him being in the print that he's working at three private schools doing tennis, irrespective of his face being on My Kitchen Rules.

'They consistently say there is no source of collection, there is no avenue for us to collect revenue,' she said.

Friends in high place? Adam's ex-wife also claims the former tennis pro used to coach judge Pete Evans, a claim Channel Seven refute

Spokesman and General Manager for the Department of Human services, who over-sees the Child Support Agency, Hank Jongen told Brady: 'I can't talk about individual cases but let me assure you, that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations.'

'We will do whatever it takes to recover that money,' he added.

Following the explosive A Current Affair interview, TV WEEK published quotes from the former tennis professional discussing his difficult divorce, saying the situation 'is not ideal'.

'Obviously I'd like to spend more time with them,' he told the magazine.

However, Channel Seven claim the TV WEEK interview was done prior to Adam's ex-wife's interview earlier this week and the article has since been taken off their website. 

At the time the former tennis pro had said: 'Any split from a former wife is going to be tough and yeah it is tough,' he said, adding: 'Things end because both parties are unhappy.'

'If everything was great we’d still be together,' he said.
