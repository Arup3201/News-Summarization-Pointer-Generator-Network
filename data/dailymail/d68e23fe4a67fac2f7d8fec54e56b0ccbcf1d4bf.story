Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League, Football League and FA Cup fixtures.

1. Arsenal’s performance at Stoke was so bad that they ended up trying to play The Potters at what used to be their own game of lumping long balls.

Aaron Ramsey dropped deeper and deeper trying to aim for Danny Welbeck and Olivier Giroud, attempting eight long passes in the second half – more than any other Arsenal outfield player.

The Gunners also attempted more crosses than Stoke – 27 against the home side's 23.

2. If banging in crosses is part of a new Arsenal philosophy they will be grateful to West Ham for the way Carl Jenkinson has been converted into an attacking full back during his loan at Upton Park.

The 22-year-old, who earned one England cap as a sub in a friendly against Sweden in 2012, fired in 10 crosses, including the one from which Andy Carroll scored the first of his two goals in the 3-1 win over Swansea.

He’s attempted 57 crosses in 12 games as a Hammer this season, an average of 4.75 per match. In his 14 Premier League appearances for the Gunners last year his average was 2.4.

3. Aston Villa have stumbled on a central defensive pairing to take them forward if they can’t keep Ron Vlaar away from the clutches of Manchester United in January.

In four games since Ciaran Clark and Jores Okore were flung together to solve an injury crisis, Villa have now conceded just three times.

Against Leicester they made 27 clearances between them, with Denmark centre half Okore winning 100 per cent of his tackles.

4. Steven Taylor will be suspended from Newcastle’s trip to Arsenal next weekend but should be the first name on Alan Pardew’s teamsheet when Sunderland arrive at St James’ Park for the North East derby on December 21.

The 28-year-old Geordie has started only six games this season after falling out of favour with Pardew – but ending Chelsea’s unbeaten record means the Toon have won every single one of them.

5. Aaron Lennon might be keen to point out a similar statistic to Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino after being dumped back on the bench until the final seven minutes against Palace.

The winger doesn’t appear to fit his manager’s system – but when he does play Tottenham get results.

The 3-0 defeat at Chelsea, when he was hauled off after 58 minutes, was the first time he had been on the losing side of a game he started all season. Tottenham’s record in his other seven starts reads won six, drawn one.

6. Roberto Martinez claimed Eliaquim Mangala should have got a red card for catching Samuel Eto’o with a kung-fu style kick.

Whatever the rights and wrongs of referee Andre Marriner’s decision there’s no doubt that Mangala has still got problems finding the correct composure to bring his physical style of play in tune with the Premier League.

The £32m France defender has now picked up four yellow cards and one red in his nine domestic games since signing for City from Porto in the summer.

7. QPR centre half Richard Dunne might not be the quickest but he makes up for it with speed of thought and determination to defend.

In the victory over Burnley he made 20 clearances – more than anyone else – and won 100 per cent of his tackles.

Since the 35-year-old got back into the team Rangers have won 10 points from eight games.

8. Derby’s promotion efforts are benefiting from a bit of father-and-son work between boss Steve McClaren and his son Joe.

McClaren Jnr is in charge of Under 21 recruitment at Pride Park, and was the man responsible for targeting Real Madrid youngster Omar Mascarell to sign on a season-long loan.

The Tenerife-born defensive midfielder has taken time to settle in England, but was excellent in the 3-0 win over Brighton that kept the Rams at the top of the Championship.

Joe had been tracking the progress of 21-year-old Mascarell since he spotted him while working in analysis for his dad’s old club Twente.

9. Wolves chairman Steve Morgan once fell out with his manager of the time Mick McCarthy by going into the dressing room to give his players a rollicking after a 3-0 home defeat by Liverpool.

The 62-year-old house building multi-millionaire clearly didn’t learn any lessons about letting his passions boil over. He will be in hot water with the FA after confronting referee Mike Jones on the pitch at the end of his club’s 2-1 defeat by Bournemouth.

Jones, demoted from the Premier League list for booking Sergio Aguero instead of giving him a penalty, had sent off Wolves stars Rajiv van La Parra and Matt Doherty.

10. One of the sores that never healed between MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon was over which club was entitled to wallow in the FA Cup history of the Crazy Gang’s 1988 triumph over Liverpool.

Fitting, then, that in the week that the controversial documentary remembering that epic achievement had its premiere the club the fans launched after seeing their own hijacked should manage its own Cup milestone.

A 1-0 win at Wycombe thanks to Sean Rigg’s goal put AFC into the third round for the first time since the club was formed 12 years ago. Meanwhile, the MK version went out losing 1-0 at home to Chesterfield.
