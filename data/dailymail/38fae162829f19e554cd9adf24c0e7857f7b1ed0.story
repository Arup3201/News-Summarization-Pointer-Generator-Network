It's not Economics for Dummies, but it's not that far off.

The Bank of England is widely believed to be home to many of the sharpest mathematical and financial minds in the country.

And central to their work is the impressive library where millions of pages of complex theory, analysis and research gathered over the three hundred-odd years of the Bank's existence are kept.

So it may come as a surprise to learn that the most popular book in the Bank's library is not a work by Keynes, Smith or  Hayek but a basic economics textbook aimed at AS and A-level students.

With its 'easy-to-use' structure and full colour illustrations, Alain Anderton's Economics has long-been a favourite of youngsters hoping to get a grip on basic economic theory.

Now in its fifth edition, which was published in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, a freedom of information request found the book had been issued and renewed 33 times at the Bank in 2014.

Author Mr Anderton told the Times newspaper that he was 'astonished' to learn of its popularity at the Bank.

He said: 'The economists at the Bank of England are top-notch, they certainly don't need to read my book.'

The Bank currently provides development for secretaries, graduates and school leavers and was quick to point out that it holds copies of the book to support staff studying for  exams.

Other popular titles include This Time is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly co-authored by Kenneth Rogoff and The Bankers' New Clothes by Anat Admati

Other popular titles include a work by one of chancellor George Osborne's favourite authors This Time is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly co-authored by Kenneth Rogoff.

Perhaps to the chagrin of the Bank's governor Mark Carney is the popularity of The Bankers' New Clothes by Anat Admati, an advisor to US financial regulator the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

A book by Anat Admati, an author highly critical of Governor Mark Carney, pictured, was among the most popular reads

Mr Admati famously criticised Mr Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January claiming he had mislead the public by suggesting that progress had been made tackling the too-big-to-fail banks.

Other popular reads at the bank include House of Debt by Atif Milan and Amir Sufi, Wrong: Nine Economic Policy Disasters and What We Can Learn From Them by Richard Grossman. 

Last year a freedom of information request revealed that the most popular book in the Houses of Parliament library was ‘How Parliament Works’ by Roger Roberts.

The book- described as a comprehensive guide to the complexities of Westminster - was taken out 16 times by MPs trying to get a grips on the complicated workings of Parliament. 

MPs were also found to be reading a great deal of non-political material including a Lonely Planet travel guide and a book advocating the stress-relieving benefits of meditation.

The travel companion to Burma includes references to the water-bound temples on tranquil Inle Lake and hot air ballooning over the ancient city of Bagan. The guide by John Allen was the eight most popular loan over the last financial year.
