Black bears living in Yosemite National Park in California are shunning human food and returning to their natural diets, research has found.

Unlike Yogi Bear, the cartoon character famously known for his fondness for 'pic-a-nic baskets', the black bears are turning away from raiding visitor’s supplies and going back to a natural diet, after years of dangerously high consumption of processed foods.

After implementing strict rules and tough fines on storing food in the park, the percentage of human foods in Yosemite bears’ diets has gone down from a 35 per cent high in the 1980s to just 13 per cent.

Bears for berries: After park management implemented restrictions on bears' access to human foods, the Yosemite black bears have gone back to a natural diet

By analysing hair and bone samples from bears living in the park, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, were able to estimate how much of the Yosemite bears’ diet was food sourced from humans.

The percentage of human food in the bears' diet increased proportionally to visitors’ numbers until the late 90s, when a new strategy was implemented to reduce their access.

Management found that human foods led to aggressive and problematic behaviour among the bears and began to work on strategies to restrict the bears’ exposure to it.

The research found that the proportion of human foods in the bears’ diets decreased by about 63 per cent after the new strategies was implemented in the late 90s.

Bear-ly legal: After bears were given food to entertain visitors in the 1920s, they developed a taste for human treats and by the 1980s 35 per cent of their diet was 'non-natural'

Since the new restrictions were put in place, the levels of human foods in the bears' diets is now at a 1915 level

‘Yosemite has a rich history of bear management practices as a result of shifting goals over the years,’ Jack Hopkins, lead author of the paper and a research fellow at UC Santa Cruz, said in a statement.

‘What we found was that the diets of 
bears changed dramatically after 1999, when the park got funding to 
implement a proactive management strategy to keep human food off the 
landscape.’

Unlike his real-life friends, Yogi Bear is hardly ready to give up on picnic baskets just yet

Mr Hopkins obtained bone and hair samples from bears killed from 1915 and onwards, including contemporary fur samples collected in Yosemite National Park.

The average proportion of human food in bear diets for the period from 1915 to 1919 was 13 per cent, but this increased as management pandered to the visitors, making human food accessible to the bears so tourists could watch them feed.

This got the bears used to human food, something which they taught their young and despite the last artificial feeding area closing in 1971, the bears were addicted.

They managed to find their own ways to get their paws on the goods, and between 1975 and 1985, the percentage of human foods in their diets was 35 per cent.

‘The bears just went back to the camp grounds and hotels and continued to find human food,’ Hopkins said.

In 1999, the new strategy, which includes using bear-resistant food-storage containers and establishing a ‘bear team’ to make sure visitors followed the rules on storing foods, was implemented and by 2001, the numbers were down to 13 per cent.

 ‘The remarkable thing is that the bears that eat human food are now back to the same level of dumpster diving as in 1915, despite the fact that there are now millions of visitors in Yosemite every year and presumably a lot more garbage,’ the study’s co-author Paul Koch, a professor of Earth sciences and dean of physical and biological sciences at UC Santa Cruz, said.
