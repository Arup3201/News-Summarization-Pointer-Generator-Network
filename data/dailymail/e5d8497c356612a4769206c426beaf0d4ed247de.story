Heather Watson was dumped out of the Korea Open in the first round in Seoul on Tuesday, beaten by American qualifier Nicole Gibbs.

Watson, seeded eighth for this tournament, managed to convert just one of seven break points in the first set before Gibbs, ranked 55 places lower than Watson at 101 in the world, dominated the second in a 7-5 6-2 win.

The swift exit here comes on the back of Watson's first-round exit from the US Open in New York last month.

Watson's fellow seeds, Klara Koukalova and Kaia Kanepi, had no such problems as they both progressed to the second round.

Third seed Koukalova dominated the first set against Kiki Bertens but ended up coming through in three, 6-0, 4-6, 6-4.

Kanepi, who is ranked sixth in Korea, comfortably defeated Elizaveta Kulichkova in straight sets 6-2, 6-4.

Maria Kirilenko fought back from a set down to knock out Donna Vekic 3-6, 6-2, 6-4.
