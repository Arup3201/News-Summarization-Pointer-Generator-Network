California may already be in the midst of one of its worst droughts in decades, but now scientists have warned that the southwest is at risk of water shortages which could last up to 30 years.

Climate scientists have claimed that the chances of experiencing a decade-long drought in the region have now reached 50 per cent, while the chances of a 'megadrought' lasting more than 30 years is now between 20 and 50 per cent.

Researchers from Cornell University, the University of Arizona and U.S. Geological Survey say their predictions should be viewed as 'conservative' as not enough is being done to curb emissions that lead to climate change.

Toby Ault, a professor at Cornell, said any of these long droughts would 'be worse than anything seen during the last 2,000 years and would pose unprecedented challenges to water resources in the region'.

Roughly 58 per cent of California is now facing 'exceptional' drought conditions, the most severe category of drought, as rivers dry up and farmers warn of crop failures across the state.

California is currently in the grips of one of the most severe droughts in the last decade as climate scientists warn the problem could get even worse

Climate experts have warned that the chances of a drought lasting longer than a decade affecting the area are now around 50 per cent

More worryingly the chances of a 'megadrought', lasting more than 30 years, in the southwest are now between 20 and 50 per cent

Researchers claim their estimates should be viewed as 'conservative' as temperatures are still rising due to man-made climate change 

The professor who lead the study says a decade-long drought in California would 'be worse than anything seen during the last 2,000 years'

Around 60 per cent of California is now facing 'exceptional' drought conditions, the worst possible rating on a scale of five

Authors of the study say because not enough is being done to combat climate change emissions the chances of a 'megadrought' are becoming increasingly likely

Experts have said that they cannot say when the Californian drought will end, but predicted that the conditions offer 'a glimpse of the future'

As the drought in California continues for a third year, the water level in Shasta Lake is now at its lowest level since 1977

Experts are warning that current conditions in California could provide a glimpse into the future of the southwest thanks to climate change
