A self-described pimp accused of murdering three people last year in a fiery shootout on the Las Vegas Strip had the sentencing in an unrelated case delayed a second time.

Attorneys for Ammar Harris, 27, asked for additional time to review court transcripts from a sex assault conviction in September as he awaits trial later this year in a shocking triple murder.

Mr Harris was found guilty last year of sexual assault and robbery charges stemming from a June 2010 case – his attorneys have argued they may appeal on grounds he did not receive a fair trial.

The convicted sexual predator’s public defenders asked for the extra time because they were only assigned to his case after his conviction.

He received new attorneys after his initial counsel withdrew from the case after citing a difference of opinion in defense strategy.

‘If I was being sentenced, I would want my attorney to know what happened at my trial,’ defense attorney Robert Langford said at Wednesday’s hearing, according to the Las Vegas Sun.

Prosecutor David Stanton opposed the postponement because he plans to present the sex assault conviction to a jury that will decide whether he faces the death penalty for the incident on the Las Vegas Strip.

Mr Harris stands accused of chasing a man down the Strip after an argument in a nightclub parking lot, shooting him dead and causing a chain reaction crash that saw a taxi explode as stunned tourists watched in horror.

Three people died – the man police say was shot dead by Mr Murphy and the cab’s driver and passenger.

A fourth person in the car shot at by Mr Murphy was shot multiple times but survived, five others suffered minor injuries.

Authorities went on a multistate manhunt before finally finding him. He was charged with three counts of capital murder.

The accused killer posted multiple videos online showing a flashy lifestyle with fistfuls of $100 bills, fast cars and a harem of faster women.

Mr Murphy’s only previous criminal convictions were for a felony weapons charge and marijuana possession.

He’s now cooling his heels in Clark County Detention Center while awaiting his next court date.
