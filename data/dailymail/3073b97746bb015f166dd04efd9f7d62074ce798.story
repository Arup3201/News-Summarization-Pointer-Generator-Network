Mumsnet users have cast their vote on which politicians they think would make the best lovers, with Ed Balls and Boris Johnson topping the polls. 

In a light-hearted discussion on the mothers' forum, women revealed their crushes on 'sexy beast' Ed Balls, 'mysterious and moody' Gordon Brown and 'fun' Boris Johnson.

But Ed Miliband was less fortunate, with many saying they would rather have a night of passion with his brother David.

Mumsnet users said they would rather bed Ed Miliband's brother than the Labour leader, while many said Boris Johnson would be 'fun'

'Sexy beast' Ed Balls was a popular choice among mothers online, while Nick Clegg was deemed good-looking but likely to be a 'damp squib' in the bedroom

More than 100 women commented on the Mumsnet discussion - titled 'Am I being unreasonable... to wonder which major politician would make the best lover?'

One user wrote: 'I can vividly imagine Ed Miliband handcuffed to a radiator.'

But another replied: 'I'm a bit partial to David Miliband if he counts?'

One Labour MP who was popular on the Mumsnet forum was Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls.

Queen Mools wrote: 'Ed Balls is a sexy beast!'

While another user added: 'Ed Balls. He looks capable. And meaty.' 

George Osborne was likely to 'fumble' around while David Cameron is 'too arrogant to be generous' in the bedroom, Mumsnet users said

Tony Blair was also mentioned by Mumsnet users, though some said he would be too busy looking in a mirror

One user, The Travelling Lemon, gave a full run-down on who she fancied, writing: 'David Cameron is a bit too arrogant to be generous in the bedroom, if you see what I mean.

'George Osborne would be fumbling around like a virgin on prom night. Tony Blair would probably want to look in a mirror.

'Nick Clegg would be eager to please, but it would be over very quickly.'

The Deputy Prime Minister garnered a mixed opinion from mothers, with some saying he was good-looking, but likely to be as much of a 'damp squib' in the bedroom as he is in the Commons.

Owen Paterson and Eilidh Whiteford are currently the sexiest MPs, according to voters

Boris Johnson was a popular choice, with a number of women saying he would be the most 'fun'.

One wrote: Maybe Barack [Obama]...or I reckon Clegg would be a trier.' 

Other suggestions included 74-year-old Ken Clarke, 'passionate' Gordon Brown, 'charming' John Major and 'pretty attractive' Andy Burnham.

According to sexymp.co.uk - a website where users rate the attractiveness of Members of Parliament - Tory MP Owen Paterson is the best-looking male in the Commons.

The SNP's Eilidh Whiteford currently sits top of the female MPs' table.
