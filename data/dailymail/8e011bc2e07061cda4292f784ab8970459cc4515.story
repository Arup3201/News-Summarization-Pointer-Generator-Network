They witnessed a nervous start between the top two in the world with the opening seven legs going against the darts.

The Dutchman landed his first 180 of the match in the eighth leg on his way to his 10-darter and he also went close to a 170 finish in the following leg. 

'I couldn't wish any better tonight,' Van Gerwen told Sky Sports.

'We were both struggling in the beginning and we couldn't hold our own throw because we both wanted to win hard because the winner goes top of the table.

'I knew that and I just had to do the right thing at the right moments. I'm really glad I did in the end.'
