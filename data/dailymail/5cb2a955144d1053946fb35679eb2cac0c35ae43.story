A model railway fan has been ordered to dismantle his £10,000 train set in his loft by his housing association on health and safety grounds.

Father-of-three Robert Burdock, 61, has 63 locomotives which whizz along 70ft of track around the perimeter of his attic.

His train set includes hand-crafted stations, depots, streets and tiny figures - which are all enjoyed by his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Train enthusiast: Robert Burdock, 61, with his model train set in his attic in Buckfastleigh, Devon

Models: The track which runs round the perimeter of Robert's attic is 70feet long. He had been ordered to take it down by his housing association

But a social housing firm now says 
Robert has made 'alterations' to the two-bed 1950s property in 
Buckfastleigh, Devon, without permission - breaching strict planning 
regulations.

Robert, who has lived in the home for
fourteen years, says a housing official arrived to inspect a leaky 
chimney and told him the train set had to go.

They want the set removed while they 
carry out a safety assessment - but Robert would rather be evicted than 
tear up his treasured track.

Retired builder Robert said: 'I've 
been building train sets since I was 11. It's been a lifelong passion of
mine and I take a real pride in creating things.

'When I moved into this house I 
decided I needed a project to keep me going as a hobby and I decided to 
build a railway in the loft.

'Some people like to spend their money down the pub or play a few games of snooker, but for me I build railways.

'I've made much of the scenery myself and spent anything from £8,000 to 10,000 on it.

Miniature station: The stations and depots are all hand-crafted and there are even model people

Steaming: The train set, which includes 63 locomotives, must be taken apart, Robert has been told

Intricate: Robert has been building model train sets for the last 40 years and started building his current set in his loft 14 years ago

'There's absolutely no way I'm taking it down now - if they want to evict someone over a train set that's up to them.'

Robert's woes began when he rang 
Teign Housing to report a leaking chimney at the £140,000 ex-council 
property where he lives with his disabled wife Linda, 64.

He says the only work he's ever done 
to make room for the train set was to put down flooring and replace a 
single, faulty electrical socket.

Robert, who retired due to ill 
health, said: 'They have said that unless I dismantle the railway, they 
will send in their workman to pull it apart so they can put right the 
changes I've made.

'All I've done is put down flooring 
that meets all the required regulations and I've even coated the little 
buildings I make in fire-retardant.

Control panel: Robert has been ordered to take the set apart - but has challenged his housing association to try and evict him rather than take the set apart

Eviction? Robert Burdock, who lives in this housing association property in Buckfastleigh, Devon, has vowed to keep his model train set together - even if he faces being thrown out of his property

'Everything is based on trestle 
tables. I've not damaged a thing. This house was a tip when I moved in. 
I've spent thousands down the years doing it up.

'I even fitted my own central heating - you won't hear them complaining about that.

'People might think model railways are childish - but I don't think I'm being the childish one here.'

Teign Housing insists Robert's track 
has to go so inspectors can make sure the loft area is safe. The firm 
manages over 3,600 homes across south Devon.

Paul Davies, head of asset 
management, said: 'It is part of our tenancy agreement that tenants must
seek permission to make any alterations to our properties so that we 
can make sure it is safe and meets the required building regulations.

'We have written to Mr Burdock to 
explain that all items in the loft space must be removed so that we can 
gain access and reinstate the timber members to ensure the property is 
safe.

'Once this work has been done, we will look at ways for Mr Burdock's train set to be accommodated safely.'
