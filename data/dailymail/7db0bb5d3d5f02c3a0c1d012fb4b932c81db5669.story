A woman was arrested for attempted murder after allegedly stabbing her boyfriend during a heated argument in the early hours of Friday morning.

Yekaterina Pusepa was led handcuffed from the grisly scene in tears, her white T-shirt, jeans and arms covered with the blood of her injured boyfriend, Alec Katsnelson.

She was pictured on the sidewalk outside her New York home sobbing as she was led away from the scene of the crime.

Several police officers were called after the couple's loud arguing disturbed neighbours in the middle of the night.

Pusepa wept in court on Saturday when she was charged with attempted murder and second-degree assault, but she did not speak during the hearing

Pusepa, 22, allegedly pulled a kitchen 
knife on Mr Katsnelson, also 22, in the lower Manhattan apartment they 
shared with his cousin during an argument that woke neighbours.

One neighbour told the New York Post: 'She was screaming more and louder.

'It was anger and hostility like someone making threats. You could tell there was a fight.'

Pusepa was heard yelling ‘call 911’, telling the operator: ‘There is someone bleeding on the street – he’s either shot or stabbed!’

In custody: But the woman insists her boyfriend's stab wounds were self-inflicted

Turbulent past: Pusepa and Mr Katsnelson have had previous run-ins with the law over domestic violence

She then dragged his blood-soaked body from the second-floor apartment down onto the street and lay on top of him.

The
accused claimed her boyfriend’s wounds were 
self-inflicted, that she had grabbed a kitchen knife in the midst of 
their fight but that he had wrestled it from her and plunged it into his 
own chest.

Sources told the Post that that was 
untrue and that she had changed her story under questioning after her 
arrest at around 3.30am.

The
 couple had been dating since November and were said to have a turbulent
 relationship.

Police found Yekaterina Pusepa standing outside her apartment drenched in blood

Mr Katsnelson had once tried to kick Pusepa out of the flat,
 leading to a fight that saw him spend the weekend in jail.

Mr Katsnelson, a Duane Reade worker, was apparently trying to get a restraining order against his violent girlfriend.

His mother told the paper: ‘He’s in love with her. I tell him this is the wrong relationship but he wouldn’t listen.’

Pusepa has been charged with attempted murder and assault in the second degree. 

She has been in trouble with the law in the past, having been busted for driving under the influence on Christmas day 2009.
