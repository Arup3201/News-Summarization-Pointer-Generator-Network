This time last year Carolyn Whaymand received a very special gift, one that was not just for Christmas, but for life.

When the 43-year-old solicitor, who suffers from the degenerative disease cystic fibrosis, was told her kidneys were failing doctors said her only chance of survival was a transplant.

It was then that David, her devoted husband of 15 years, stepped in to save her. He put his own health at risk by offering one of his organs, incredibly for the second time.

Thirteen years earlier, City accountant David, 40, had given a portion of one of his lungs to Carolyn in a pioneering operation that was hugely controversial because so many patients had died 
during it.

Gift of life: Husband David Whayland was a donor for his wife Carolyn's kidney transplant just before Christmas last year

The proceedure was so risky, it has since been 
suspended in Britain and Carolyn is regarded as
 something of a medical miracle because she is one of only four patients to have survived it.

Doctors and transplant experts also say David is the only known case in which a living donor has given up two organs.

Not only are the risks of such surgery considerable, doctors said it is highly unlikely for a husband to be 
able to donate to his spouse, as finding a suitable match for a 
transplant is notoriously difficult.

Twelve months on the couple, of Ingatestone, Essex, have been trying to get her lives back together - and Carolyn has a special message of thanks to her husband.

'Dave
 and I recovered well after the operation, we managed to get out just 
before Christmas, although had to go to clinic regularly between 
Christmas and New Year,' she said.

'If 
there was a husband of the century then he would win the award as he is 
truly marvellous but he would not admit to that.

'The
 kidney worked well straight away, but I did have problems with water 
infections so they removed the tube that links the bladder to the kidney
 early and I was then fine.

'The
 operation was more traumatic than we had anticipated, because we had 
not realised how much you use your stomach muscles, however we managed 
and as each week went by we improved.

'Dave
 went back to work on a phased return after six weeks and I went back to
 work on a phased return in March being back full time in May.

'Generally
 things were going very well and I had a routine biopsy in May when that
 showed that I had infection and possible rejection which caused a scare
 and meant I had to go back on steroids and have much more frequent 
check ups until it cleared. 

'We
 had planned a short holiday so it was nail biting to know if we would 
be able to go, but we did go to Portugal for a week and had a nice 
break.  This made us feel like we were finally back to our normal lives.

'Things have been going well since and we went to Crete for a two week break in September for Dave’s 40th birthday. '

World class treatment: Carolyn received her transplant at Hammersmith Hospital in West London

About 1,000 people in the UK give up a
 kidney for a friend or loved one every year. The Human Tissue 
Authority, which regulates all donations by living people, must decide 
who is suitable.

Volunteers must prove they are in robust health and understand what the lengthy, physically arduous process will involve.

There can be a 12-week recovery period, and a one-in-3,000 risk of dying while having a kidney removed.

David, along with four members of 
Carolyn's family, including her father and brother, volunteered to be 
tested to see if they could donate.

Unusually, David turned out to be a good match and Carolyn's cousin also offered a section of his lung.

'Having
 a kidney transplant is nowhere near as serious as a lung transplant, 
but from the patient perspective it is more complicated. With my lungs, I
 know how they are on a daily basis, I can be wheezy or chesty and I 
take the necessary medication.

'They
 don’t mind what I eat or drink and providing I do not let myself get 
cold and do a bit of exercise then they work well and look after me.  It
 is much easier to tell if they are not working properly and I can sort 
it out.

'With the 
kidney, you have to make sure you drink two to 2.5 litres every day, be 
careful with what tablets you take or anything you put into your body as
 it could go through the kidney and you don’t want to damage it.

'Unless you have signs of a water infection early, by the time you get symptoms it is already taken a hold.

'So that makes me more conscience of everything and not able to completely forget that I have had a transplant.

'That
 being said, I am much better in myself.  I am able to have a life, 
work, do my hobbies, to the housework, go out etc,, which I could not do
 when my kidney was failing.

'Both
 employers have been extremely supportive, and my work have been 
particularly good given the number of clinic appointments I have had to 
attend over the year.

'I
 am now down to once a month at the renal clinic which makes things a 
lot easier. The staff at the renal clinic are outstanding.

'All
 the nurses and doctors work so hard, people are always moaning about 
the NHS but the staff at Hammersmith, Harefield and the Royal Brompton 
as outstanding.'

Carolyn,
 who was diagnosed with the genetic condition cystic fibrosis aged two, 
was already on the transplant list when David proposed in 1996.

The
 couple, who met when they were teenagers, were married the following 
year.

Cystic fibrosis affects the internal organs, especially the lungs 
and digestive system, by clogging them with sticky mucus, making it hard
 to breathe and digest food.
