Country singer Glen Campbell's two oldest children have launched a court fight to take medical and financial decisions away from his wife of 32 years.

The move has emerged days after Kim Campbell, whose husband has late-stage Alzheimer's, was forced to stand in for 78-year-old as he was nominated for Best Song at the Oscars. 

Now it has been made clear how deeply the singer's two oldest children, Debby Campbell-Cloyd and Travis Campbell, are unhappy with the arrangement.

Frail: Country music legend Glen Campbell is now the subject of a court battle between his wife of 32 years and his two eldest children, who say she is isolating him from other family members as he battles Alzheimer's

The pair filed a court petition in January, saying Kim Campbell is keeping their father 'secluded from the rest of the family' which has been 'prohibited from participating in his care and/or treatment.' 

The petition claims that Kim Campbell is not providing her husband with needed toiletries and clothing, not visiting him regularly and possibly mishandling his finances.

It says several of his eight children - the three youngest of which were with Kim - are not on his list of allowed visitors.

And it alleges that Kim Campbell has allowed her husband to be interviewed and filmed at the facility, even though his disease has progressed to the point where that is inappropriate.

The petition to a Nashville court concludes by asking a judge to appoint conservators and a guardian to protect Glen Campbell's interests.

Health: Glen Campbell revealed he had Alzheimer's in 2011 but has played hundreds of shows since

The 78-year-old Country Music Hall of Fame member is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and living at a Nashville long-term care facility.

His daughter had already criticised Mrs Campbell for moving him into the facility - but she insisted it was the best thing for the aging legend.

Mrs Campbell said: 'It is crushingly sad to see him afflicted with Alzheimer's but indulging those feelings does not help him.

'I am his wife and no one wants him home more than me but I must do what is in his best interest.'

When questioned by the Associated Press Kim Campbell referred questions about the petition to her attorney, Bill Harbison, who said he could not comment because the judge has placed the petition under seal.

Glen Campbell revealed he had Alzheimer's disease in 2011, but he went on to record two albums and play more than 150 concerts.

At the time, Kim Campbell said the tour was a way to help her husband combat the brain-ravaging disease and spend time with family members who made up his band and traveled with him. 

He also starred in a documentary about life with Alzheimer's, Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me.

Last month, he won a Grammy for his song I'm Not Gonna Miss You, which plays at the conclusion of the documentary. The song also was nominated for an Oscar.

Mrs Campbell stood in for him at the ceremony, telling reporters on the red carpet: 'I'm not sure if he's really aware but he will be at his own little Oscar party tonight.

'It would be lovely to go back and let him hold one. It's just hard for him to understand.

The Best Song gong went to rap artist Common and R&B star John Legend for Glory, the anthem from Selma.
