Two Secret Service agents on President Obama's detail has been reprimanded after trying to force himself into a woman's hotel room to collect a bullet that he had left there after meeting her hours before in the hotel bar.

Ignacio Zamora Jr., who works as a senior supervisor in charge of more than 20 agents, was investigated by his superiors after a hotel staffer reported his unusual behavior. The ensuing investigation also found that he and another agent, Timothy Barraclough, were sending sexually suggestive emails to a female subordinate.

Both men have now been suspended from the Secret Service and the incident remains under investigation.

Scandal prone: The latest Secret Service incident happened in May of this year when an agent (not one of those pictured above) tried to get a bullet that he left in a woman's hotel room

Scene: The agent was off duty when he met the woman in the bar of the Hay-Adams Hotel just one block from the White House and he spent time with her in her hotel room

The latest scandal comes a year after the agency came under fire when one agent got into an argument with a prostitute in Colombia and a dozen others became involved with the incident and resulting cover up.

The Washington Post has revealed that the backlash that resulted from the Cartegena scandal was not enough to scare the Secret Service agents straight because this latest incident took place in May of this year.

The May incident began when Zamora met a woman in the bar of the Hay-Adams hotel and they went back to her hotel room.

The Hay-Adams is a luxury hotel located just one block from the White House, making itâ€™s bar a popular hangout for agents and other government workers. The President and his family has also stayed there, and he hosted a dinner there earlier this year when he was trying to reach out to Republicans over budget negotiations.

Brushing past it: The report says that the agency does not have institutional issues but just problems with certain agents who were found to solicit prostitutes and drink with locals while prepping for presidential visits

Close: One of the two agents who is the subject of the investigation was a favorite of former First Lady Laura Bush (seen here with other agents in 2002 and not necessarily Ignacio Zamora Jr, who is the one from the latest scandal)

During the ensuing investigation, Zamora took the bullets out of the state-issued gun that he had with him even though he was off duty.

When he left later that night, he realized that he had left one bullet inside the room and asked her to let him back in.

The woman, who has not been identified, would not allow him back in so he went down to the front desk of the hotel identifying himself as a Secret Service agent and asking to be let into the room.

The clerk at the desk thought that the request seemed strange and the hotel contacted the White House to report the suspicious behavior.

Officials then launched a probe into Zamora's activity and read through his emails on his government-issued Blackberry where they found that he and Barraclough had been sending sexually suggestive emails to another Secret Service employee.

International incident: In May 2012, a Secret Service agent who was in Colombia ahead of the President's visit to the country got into an altercation with a prostitute

Woman in the middle: Dania Suarez was identified as the prostitute involved in the Cartagena scandal

The Washington Post says that the female agent's name has not been revealed because she has not be reprimanded in connection to the emails.

'We have always maintained that the Secret Service has a professional and dedicated workforce,' Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told the paper.

'Periodically we have isolated incidents of misconduct, just like every organization does.'

Zamora has been pulled from his position, while Barraclough has been moved off the detail to a separate part of the division, people familiar with the case told the Post.

Barraclough was given the prestigious promotion to the President's detail four years ago, but Zamora has had close contact with the first family for longer.

Restoring trust: Even new Secret Service head Julia Pierson thinks that the report is flawed since it is based on an anonymous survey of agents who were effectively asked to report 'rumors and gossip'

Before being added to the President's detail himself, The Washington Post reports that he was in charge of the agency's Mexico City office and then returned to the United States and was tasked with leading Laura Bush's detail while her husband was president.

In her memoir, Mrs Bush specifically thanks Mr Zamora for keeping her safe in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.

The new investigation was revealed as part of an inspector general report that began in the wake of the Cartagena scandal which lead to the then-director to step down. President Obama then promoted Julia Pierson to head the agency, making her the first ever female director of the department.
