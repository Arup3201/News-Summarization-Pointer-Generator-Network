The bullying behaviour of a Big Brother housemate made the show the most complained about programme of the year.

The Channel 5 show sparked 2,088 complaints to TV watchdog Ofcom throughout the 2012 series.

And more than half concerned housemate Conor McIntyre's threatening remarks towards fellow contestant Deana Uppal.

Conor McIntyre's behaviour during this year's Big Brother prompted more than 1,000 complaints to Ofcom

Contest Deana Uppal said she felt 'bullied' after she was subjected to a foul-mouthed rant by housemate Conor McIntyre

At one point he told other contestants he would 'punch her in the face, just knock her out' and sexually assault her with a hair brush.

Ofcom ruled that the show, which transferred to Channel 5 after it was dropped by Channel 4 in 2010, breached broadcasting guidelines.

Second came The X Factor Results show, with most complaints surrounding singer Carolynne Poole's controversial exit after an executive was seen whispering in judge Louis Walsh's ear.

Viewers accused the ITV1 show's 
producers of engineering a fix when the Irish judge initially appeared 
to save Poole, before backing eccentric singer Rylan Clark, when they 
were the bottom two in the public vote.

Third was This Morning, with most complaints concerning the stunt which saw presenter Phillip Schofield hand a list of names of alleged Tory paedophiles to Prime Minister David Cameron during a live interview.

Former Tory politician Lord McAlpine today reached a £125,000 settlement with ITV and Schofield over the incident.

Fourth was True Stories: Gypsy Blood,
a Channel 4 programme which traced the tradition of bare knuckle 
fighting and featured scenes of dogs attacking deer and cock fighting.

The
top 10 was completed by Live: The Silent Ascent, broadcast on the Sikh 
Channel, Sky News,The X Factor, Channel 4 documentary Islam: the Untold 
Story, BBC1 sitcom Citizen Khan and Keith Lemon's LemonAid, in which 
Lemon offered a puppy as as prize in a competition on the ITV1 show.
