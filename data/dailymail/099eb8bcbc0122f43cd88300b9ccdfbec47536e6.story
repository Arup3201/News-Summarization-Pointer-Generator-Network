England's Paul Casey shot an eight-under-par 62 as he made a superb start at the Sony Open in Hawaii.

The 37-year-old carded nine birdies at the Waialae Country Club in Honolulu as he made the early running along with American Webb Simpson.

The only blemish on the three-time European Ryder Cup player's card was a bogey five on the sixth hole, which was his 15th.

Englishman Paul Casey almost equalled the course record after the opening round at the Sony Open 

Simpson also played the back nine first, but was only one under at the turn.

He hit form with a run of seven birdies in his last nine to join Casey on a score that was just one short of the competitive course record.

American Webb Simpson also shot a round of 62 to share the lead in Hawaii
