A blaze on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane which caused widespread disruption at Heathrow airport last week has been linked to a lithium battery in its emergency beacon, air accident investigators have revealed.

The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the plane’s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) caught fire and had shown indications of disruption to the battery cells which ‘could provide the energy for an ignition’.

The ELT is an emergency beacon used to give emergency services and authorities an accurate location for a plane following a crash.

Boeing’s hi-tech flagship ‘plastic plane’ has been dogged with faults since launch and already been grounded worldwide because of battery problems elsewhere in the plane.

The new investigators’ report notes that the emergency beacon in the stricken aircraft contained a set of  lithium-manganese dioxide-based chemical batteries which allow  it to operate in an emergency.

It said: ‘Detailed examination of the  ELT has shown some indications of disruption to the battery cells.

‘It is not clear however, whether the combustion in the area of the ELT was initiated by a release of energy within the batteries or by an external mechanism such as an electrical short.’

The Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) is an emergency beacon used 
to give emergency services and authorities an accurate location for a 
plane following a crash.

The 
beacons, made by U.S. conglomerate Honeywell, are positioned in the 
upper rear part of the advanced jets, and send a signal that leads 
rescuers to downed aircraft.

AAIB said Honeywell had produced some 6,000 ELTs of the same design, which are fitted to a wide range of aircraft.

They are powered by non-rechargeable, lithium-manganese batteries.

AAIB's 
report said aviation regulators should conduct a safety review of 
lithium-powered emergency locator beacons in all aircraft types.

The ELT history indicated the event was rare, and the fire happened while the aircraft was unoccupied, it said.

Boeing said it supported the AAIB's recommendations and reiterated its confidence in the Dreamliner's safety.

It said it stood by the plane's 'overall integrity'.

The AAIB 
recommended that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ensure the 
power was turned off in all Honeywell-made ELT systems in the 60-plus 
Dreamliners currently in commercial service.

A source close to the probe said this could mean removing the ELT's batteries.

Honeywell said it did not expect any financial impact from the incident.

The
 battery linked to the London fire is made by New York-based Ultralife 
Corp, according to an industry source. Ultralife did not return calls or
 emails seeking comment.

But it stresses: ‘In the case of an electrical short, the same batteries could provide the energy for an ignition and suffer damage in the subsequent fire.’

The AAIB today called on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to begin efforts to make the ELT ‘inert’ on all 787 aircraft until the safety of the device can be explored further.

Thousands of passengers faced travel chaos last Friday after the aircraft, which has been plagued with problems since its launch, caught fire while on a remote parking stand shortly after 4.30pm.

Nobody was on board the Ethiopian Airlines-operated plane at the time of the incident and there were no injuries.

Runways were closed to all flights for an hour and a half while emergency crews dealt with the blaze, which caused diversions and long delays for passengers.

The AAIB investigation said: ‘The history of this ELT product line indicated that a thermal event is extremely rare.

‘However, large transport aircraft do not typically carry the means of fire detection or suppression in the space above the cabin ceilings and had this event occurred in-flight, it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin crew in tackling the resulting fire.’

The report said investigations would continue into what triggered the fire in the emergency beacon.

Investigators said US aerospace part manufacturer Honeywell, which built the ELT, had been invited to join their probe into the incident.

Another different battery problem earlier this year led to delivery delays which caused Thomson Airways to scrap plans to use the ultra-green aircraft in May and June. The carrier finally began Dreamliner services earlier this month.

Continuous production difficulties had already plagued the Dreamliner. It should have entered passenger service in 2008 but it was not until October 2011 that the first commercial flight was operated by Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways.

British Airways has taken delivery of the first of its 24 Dreamliners, while Virgin Atlantic is due to receive the first of its 16 Dreamliners in September next year.

Investigators also called on the FAA to conduct a safety review of installations of similar Lithium-powered ELTs in other aircraft.

In a statement, Boeing described the recommendation for the beacons to be immobilised as ‘a precautionary measure’ adding: ‘The safety of passengers and crew members who fly aboard Boeing airplanes is our highest priority.

Boeing’s revolutionary ‘plastic plane’ was  grounded globally in January  after safety watchdogs in Europe, the USA and Asia  warned that its leaky back-up  electric batteries could cause it to catch fire.

Flight safety officials banned 
Boeing’s flagship 787 Dreamliner from taking off amid fears the faulty 
lithium-type batteries, which are also used in electric cars and 
laptops, could start fires on board.

The
 Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion 
batteries to help power its energy-hungry electrical systems.

The batteries charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries.

But
 the electrolyte fluid also conducts electricity, so as it spreads it 
can cause short-circuits and ignite fires.  Its corrosiveness also 
raised concern about whether a leak might weaken a key support structure
 of the plane.

It is 
dubbed the ‘plastic plane’ because its fuselage is ‘spun’ from 
super-strong but lightweight carbon fibre, which cuts weight and fuel 
consumption, rather than constructed from aluminium

AAIB said that the beacon in such planes should be switched off, spurring a rally in shares from relieved investors.

Boeing
 said the beacon could be removed in about an hour from its newest model
 plane, which was grounded for more than three months earlier this year 
due to a battery issue that regulators said was unrelated to the fire on
 an Ethiopian Airlines jet.

The
 U.S. Federal Aviation Administration regulations do not require the 
transmitter, but some other nations do, the plane maker said in a 
statement backing the British report.

A
 European regulatory official said the jets could fly with the locator 
beacons temporarily de-activated, despite regulations mandating them in 
most commercial situations.

Analysts cautioned that the British report still left open the question of how the fire actually started.

'This is not really what you call a conclusive answer,' said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with the Teal Group.

'There's
 nothing about this finding that indicates a lack of safety with the 
plane, but on the other hand there's no conclusive proof that a system 
unrelated to the plane is to blame.

Shares in Boeing rose 2.6 percent to $107.40, closing in on the all-time high of $108.15, set just before the fire was reported.

Loren Thompson, a U.S.-based analyst and consultant with close ties to 
industry, said the UK recommendation did not call into question the 
airworthiness of the 787, which offered some good news for Boeing.

'The Honeywell device is simply a beacon for locating the aircraft in an
 accident, so it has no bearing on the flight worthiness of the plane,' 
Thompson said.

Despite early concerns about the composite nature of the plane, 
high-tech electronics were turning out to be a bigger headache for the 
Dreamliner, Thompson said.

Honeywell shares were trading 72 cents higher at $83.17 around midday, 
near a year-high, while shares in Ultralife Corp were up 1 cent from 
Wednesday's close of $3.82.
