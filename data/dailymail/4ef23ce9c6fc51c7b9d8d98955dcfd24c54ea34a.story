A Washington state high school teacher employed a 'Wheel of Misfortune' game to punish her students - and is going back to work. 

Kem Patteson instructed her Stevenson High School students to launch Koosh balls toward their peers in two different taped instances, KATU reported.

'I was chewing gum in class,' student Zoey Zapfe told the affiliate station of an incident caught on camera earlier this month. 'She looked over and she told me to spin the wheel and that's like a normal thing.'

'It was beyond humiliating': Koosh balls were reportedly thrown at Zoey Zapfe after she chewed gum in class

Punishment: Patteson employed this so-called 'Wheel of Misfortune' 

Zapfe also revealed how she was punished, when both her teacher and her classmates threw a ball at her in a 'cush firing squad,' KATU reported.

'I clearly said that I didn't want to do this, and after that I found out that you can opt out with a lunch detention and when I said I don't want to do this, she said "Too bad" or something and I got pelted,' Zapfe told the affiliate station.

'I'm gonna be honest, I'm hoping she gets fired because it was beyond humiliating,' Zapfe also said.

Other students have spoken out and offered different opinions.

'I've gotten "Kooshed" a couple times but never in the face or anything,' Hannah Young told KGW. 'I kinda think they're overreacting a little bit. She probably shouldn't have done it, but I don't know if it's cause to fire her.'

Marina Levy also told the station 'Everything on "the wheel" can be exchanged for a lunch detention so students are never forced to do anything. I don't think this is anything near what it's being made into.'

Punishment: A Koosh ball is seen on the floor after the rubber toys were thrown at a student, whose identity has been protected 

Teacher: Though chemistry teacher Kem Patteson was on administrative leave, she is not being fired

Though Zapfe's mother Wendy complained and Patteson was on administrative leave, she is not being fired, The Columbian reported.

High school principal Sarah Marino and Superintendent Dan Read said in an October 16 letter to parents: 'As you may know, we’ve been working with a third-party investigator to review the details of a video that surfaced on social media last week.' 

'The situation called to light an inappropriate classroom management technique used by a Stevenson High School teacher. It involved giving students the choice of spinning a "Wheel of Misfortune" for low-level misconduct rather than getting lunch detention.' 

'The consequences on the wheel included allowing other students in the classroom to throw a soft rubber "Koosh" ball at the student. The videos circulating showed students throwing the ball at a student.'

'This is not a practice authorized or condoned by the District and it has been stopped. When the high school became aware of the details of how the controversial classroom management tool was being used, the prop was removed from the classroom. 

'The teacher was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.'

The letter also said that 'On Wednesday, October 15th, the results of the investigation were provided to us. After interviews with students, school staff and the teacher, the investigator recommended that the teacher be re-instated to the classroom with appropriate safeguards in place to ensure an appropriate classroom environment. 

'The investigator concluded that the use of the wheel was inappropriate, but well-intentioned, and the teacher did not desire to embarrass, intimidate or harm any student.'

'However, poor judgment by any teacher is concerning and we plan to work with the teacher on more positive and productive classroom management skills going forward.'
