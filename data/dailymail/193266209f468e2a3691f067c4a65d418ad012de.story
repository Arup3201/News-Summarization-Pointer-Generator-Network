A man who said he'd rather accept the death penalty than sit through arguments over his fate after being convicted of killing a baby and her grandmother has been sentenced to die.

Raghunandan Yandamuri, 28, was sentenced to death row on Tuesday after a jury found him guilty last week in the 2012 slayings in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

Yandamuri killed 10-month-old Saanvi Venna and 61-year-old Satayrathi Venna in a botched kidnapping hatched to get ransom money from the baby's parents.

Prosecutors say Yandamuri needed the ransom money to pay off gambling and credit card debts.

The former IT worker stabbed the grandmother when she got in the way of the kidnapping.

He then left a ransom note behind, demanding $50,000 from the baby's parents for her life.

'I thought Sanvi's parents could afford to pay the money because both of them were software engineers,' Yandamuri said in a confessional statement.

Yandamuri told investigators that the baby died when he accidentally dropped her and put a handkerchief over her mouth to quiet her and a towel around her head. 

Her body was found dumped in an apartment sauna.

A pathologist testified during the trial that the baby died painfully with a 'hunger for air'.

When jurors were moved to tears heaving about the gruesome killings, Yandamuri showed no remorse which may have led to the sentencing decision.

At a hearing Friday, Yandamuri told a judge he'd rather be executed than listen to others debate his fate - and got his wish four days later.

On Tuesday, he barely reacted to the death sentence and continued to keep his head down jotting notes.

'I felt that if he had expressed remorse, he would have had a better chance at saving his life,' his sentencing attorney Henry Hilles told the Philadelpha Inquirer.

A jury deliberated for three and a half hours on Tuesday to come to that decision, choosing the death sentence over life in prison.

The decision is reportedly what the victims' family was hoping for.

'It's not going to give them back what they lost, but it is a sense of closure for them,' Deputy District Attorney Samantha Cauffman said.
