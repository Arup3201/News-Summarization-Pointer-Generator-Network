Perched just nine yards from the cliff edge and facing the certain prospect of falling into the North Sea, this house was unlikely to top any new buyers' wish list.

But the semi-detached home in Easton Bavents near Southwold in Suffolk has sold, a month before it was due to go up for auction.

The property was snapped up by mystery buyers, lured, it is thought, by a council policy aimed at helping the new owner build a brand new property in a safer spot once their new home has been demolished.

Now: The house, which is about 26ft from the edge of the cliff following December's surge tides at Easton Bavents near Southwold, has sold for an undisclosed sum

The house was a mile inland in the 17th century but is now just 26ft from the crumbling cliff edge.

There has been continuous erosion over the centuries, with the house 'moving' 2ft closer to the sea during storms which lashed the cliffs last month.

The home was bought for an undisclosed sum after being listed with a guide price of between £25,000 and £50,000.

It was due to be offered for auction on March 13 by Aldreds of Great Yarmouth.

But the sale completed on February 5 after the mystery buyer came forward.

And complete with their keys, the new owners have the promise from Waveney District Council that they will be given financial help - believed to be to the tune of £10,000 - and planning permission to demolish their stricken home and build a new property on a safer plot in the area.

The authority has established a special scheme to help those homeowners at risk of losing their homes to the force of nature.

Andrew McTear, whose insolvency firm is selling the house, said: ‘We have been very clear about the property~s future and have informed interested parties of the problems.

'The only reason anyone would want to purchase it is for the opportunity it affords for the development of another site in the locality.'

Speaking when the house went on the market, Mr McTear said: 'It may sound crazy to try selling a house that close to the edge of an eroding cliff.

November 2010: Waveney District Council said assistance would be available under its scheme for new owners of blighted houses

October 2009: Waveney council's Pathfinder scheme has offered nine Easton Bavents landowners up to £25,000 towards building and moving costs

December 2008: The council said it expected the owners of clifftop properties to have them demolished before they fell on to the beach and financial help was available

‘But by owning this property you could potentially get planning permission for another plot of land that you wouldn't otherwise be able to.

Coastal erosion is the wearing away of rock by destructive waves hitting the coastline.

There are four major forms:

‘Plots of land near Southwold with planning permission are clearly highly sought-after, so we hope to be able to sell the clifftop home, even in the knowledge that it will have to be demolished.’

Waveney council's Pathfinder scheme has offered nine Easton Bavents landowners up to £25,000 towards building and moving costs.

Coun David Ritchie, chairman of the Pathfinder board, said: ‘If you are in danger of losing your property to erosion and you sell it, the new owner would still have planning rights to build elsewhere.

‘The whole policy is an attempt to deal with coastal blight, so it could work to buy a house on a clifftop and move inland and take their planning permission with them.’

The council said it expected the owners of clifftop properties to have them demolished before they fell on to the beach and financial help was available for this.

Laura Martin, who lives next door to the home which has been sold, admitted she could not afford to buy or build another house elsewhere.

She added that her long-term plan was to live in a caravan in her back garden, which is further inland than her house.

The 57-year-old said: ‘I've got no plans to try and demolish my house because it's not in immediate danger but you can't make predictions about the future rate of erosion - nobody can.’

Other examples of major coastal erosion have happened across Britain over the past few years. Last April a house bought for £154,000 in a telephone auction by retired police officer Ann Diamond in February 2010 fell 300ft into the sea off Torquay, Devon.

In parts of East Anglia, the fast receding coastline has been severely damaged - with 6,000 truckloads of sands washed away in just three years at Hopton-on-Sea beach in Norfolk. Worried owners of a holiday park overlooking the beach said the damage threatens the future of the seafront.
