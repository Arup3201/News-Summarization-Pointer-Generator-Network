Is it a boat or is it a plane? Well, it's both, and a sensational way to see the northern coast of Corsica.

This 'flying boat', as it's known, operates out of Saint-Florent and is somewhere between a seaplane, a paraglider and a hang glider.

Starting on flat ocean water the boat is only a boat for moments, as it picks up speed and takes to the sky courtesy of its hang glider wing.

From that point it can cruise in the air to wherever the passenger desires, whether it be a joy ride around the beautiful beaches of the area such as Saleccia and Lotu or a return trip to the towns of Nonza to the north or L'Ile-Rousse to the west.

Not just reliant on the breeze, a 70 horsepower engine also helps the pilot stay in control. While the gentle noise of the engine interrupts the serenity somewhat, the freedom it offers makes the many pleasure boats that charter the waters here look positively ill-equipped.

Unsurprisingly, it's not exactly a cheap exercise, with a 30-minute return journey to Nonza Cap Corse setting visitors back 120 Euro (£74) or a flight to somewhere such as L'Ile-Rousse costing 200 Euro (£124) per hour. An extra 30 Euro (£18.50) immortalises the view in video form on a memory stick.
