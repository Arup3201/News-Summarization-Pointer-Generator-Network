A thrill seeker has been left in a critical condition in intensive care after a freak gust of wind slammed him into a sea wall as he was kitesurfing.

Mark Warren, 45, broke both his legs and suffered two broken ribs after being picked up and launched into the solid concrete seawall at Chalkwell beach in Essex.

Mr Warren was immediately airlifted to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, with life-threatening injuries after the horrific incident.

Doctors say he remains in a critical, but stable, condition and is due to have an operation to repair his heart valve in the next couple of days.

The keen kitesurfer - who has more than eight years’ experience - is believed to have been caught out by a freak gust of wind during treacherous conditions on Wednesday afternoon.

Concerned brother Ian, 47, from Billericay, Essex, said: 'He had never been injured before.

'This was just a freak gust of wind that caught him at the wrong moment.

'Mark has been kitesurfing for about eight years and he also loves playing golf and football.

'He is so full of life and looks so much younger than he is.'

Kitesurfing expert Simon Mudd, who runs the nearby Essex Kitesurf School, said even experienced surfers can be caught out by freak gusts of wind.

He said: 'This accident involved an experienced kitesurfer - it was a freak thing which just caught him out.'

Meanwhile police continue to search for a missing 52-year-old man who got into trouble in water off Southend yesterday - less than two miles down the coast from Chalkwell.

A full blown search and rescue operation was launched at 11.30am yesterday after a member of the public spotted a man desperately clinging to a mooring buoy around 400 yards out to sea.

Two RNLI lifeboats, Southend coastguard, a search and rescue helicopter from RAF Wattisham, in Suffolk, and a boat from the Essex Police marine unit joined the search operation.

No one was found although Southend RNLI staff searching the beach nearby did find clothes and personal items relating to a 52-year-old man from London.

An RNLI spokesman said: 'There was an extensive sea search to the west of the pier involving both of our lifeboats, the search and rescue helicopter, Southend Coastguard and police marine unit.

'We were looking for a male swimmer - possibly in trouble.

'A member of the public reported seeing a man clinging to a mooring buoy about 400 yards from the pier.

'We were stood down at around 1pm.'

An Essex Police spokesperson this morning confirmed that police activity continued throughout the night to trace the missing man.
