Historian Niall Ferguson has been labelled a homophobic 'pub bigot' for suggesting that the economist John Maynard Keynes didn't care about future generations because he was gay and childless.

Professor Ferguson quickly issued an abject apology, insisting that his 'stupid and insensitive' remarks at a conference had been 'off the cuff'.

But he failed to mollify critics, with one claiming yesterday that the Scottish-born Harvard academic had made similar remarks about Keynes's sexuality before.

'Stupid and insensitive': Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, left, has apologised for suggesting the economist John Maynard Keynes, right, did not care about the future because he was gay and childless

Professor Ferguson, 49, an advocate 
of austerity policies, had tried to use Keynes's famous observation that
 'in the long run, we are all dead' against him in a sideswipe at the 
British economist's 'selfish' support for high government spending.

He was apparently responding to a 
question about the contrast between the economic philosophy of 
self-interest of Keynes, who died in 1946, and that of Edmund Burke in 
the 18th century who believed there was a social contract among the 
living, the dead and those yet to be born.

Controversy: Niall Ferguson with his wife Ayaan Hirsi Ali

According to a report of his address 
to financial advisers and investors in California on Thursday, during a 
post-speech question and answer session Ferguson asked  his audience how
 many children Keynes had.

He then explained that Keynes married
 a ballerina but had a string of gay affairs. Keynes was an 'effete' 
member of society who would rather talk of poetry than procreate, 
Professor Ferguson reportedly added.

Commentators rounded on the 
historian, who has four children from two marriages, for implying that 
gays or people with no children do not care about future generations.

Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell 
said he was glad the professor had apologised for his 'homophobic slur' 
against Keynes. But he added: 'His remarks are what we might expect from
 a pub bigot, not from a Harvard history professor.'

Tom Kostigen, a financial writer who 
was in the audience, said: 'Apparently, in Ferguson's world, if you are 
gay or childless you cannot care about future generations nor society.'

Professor Ferguson said: 'I made 
comments about John Maynard Keynes that were as stupid as they were 
insensitive. I should not have suggested – in an off-the-cuff response 
that was not part of my presentation – that Keynes was indifferent to 
the long run because he had no children, nor that he had no children 
because he was gay. It is obvious that people who do not have children 
also care about future generations.'

He insisted his disagreements with 
Keynes have never had anything to do with the latter's sexual 
orientation, and went on: 'As those who know me and my work are well 
aware, I detest all prejudice, sexual or otherwise.'

'His remarks are what we might expect from a pub bigot': Peter Tatchell said it was 'shocking' that a history professor had made a 'homophobic slur' against the economist John Maynard Keynes

The professor admitted he had 
'forgotten' that Keynes's wife, Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova, became
 pregnant with his child in 1927 but miscarried.

Cambridge University economist 
Michael Kitson attacked Professor Ferguson's 'empty' apology, saying on 
Twitter: 'These were not ''off the cuff'' remarks. I heard him make the 
same over 20 years ago at a history seminar he gave at St Catherine's 
College, Cambridge.'

Others flagged up a passage in 
Professor Ferguson's 1999 book The Pity of War in which he said Keynes's
 sex life went 'into a decline' during the Second World War 'perhaps 
because the boys he liked to pick up in London all joined up'.

Keynes, hailed by Time magazine as 
one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, has influenced
 generations of politicians with his argument that governments should 
steer the economy through downturns rather than rely on the free market.
 He was open about his many homosexual affairs.

Professor Ferguson, who says he 
turned to Thatcherism as a student at Oxford, has a reputation as a 
defender of western imperialism but has attracted controversy before.

In 2011 the historian and broadcaster
 threatened to sue a book reviewer who the professor said had accused 
him of being a racist.

He and his second wife, the Somali-Dutch writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali, have a 17-month old son.
