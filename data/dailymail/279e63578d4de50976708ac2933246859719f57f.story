The Iraqi national museum has reopened its doors twelve years after tens of thousands of artefacts were looted in the wake of the U.S. invasion in 2003.

Since then around 3,000 priceless treasures, including one figurine which dates back 4,400 years, have been recovered and returned to the museum's collection.

The opening was accelerated to today after a video released by ISIS fanatics earlier this week showed them destroying 3,000-year-old sculptures in Mosul, Iraq's second city.

Iraq's national museum in Baghdad has re-opened twelve years after it was ransacked in the wake of the U.S. invasion during which an estimated 15,000 artefacts were taken

Since then officials have managed to recover around 3,000 items, while others were discovered hidden in secret storage rooms or were being kept safe overseas at the time of the raid

The museum is home to relics dating back at least 5,000 years to when Iraq was called Mesopotamia, widely considered to be the cradle of human civilization (pictured, statues dating to the second century BC)

Speaking in Baghdad today, Iraq's prime minister Haider al-Abadi said ISIS militants had destroyed around half of the exhibits and was trying to sell the others.

However, he said that each item was marked and tagged, and was calling on the international community to help thwart the 'terrorist barbarians'.

He said: 'We will chase them with the world on our side. This is a serious call to the Security Council and the United Nations and all peace-loving states to chase them all.

'Damn them and their hands for what they are doing.'

The opening of the museum was brought forward after ISIS militants were this week shown vandalising ancient sculptures in Mosul, Iraq's second city (a statue dating back to the eight century BC pictured left)

Iraq's prime minister today said ISIS militants had destroyed around half of the artefacts in Mosul's museum, and was attempting to smuggle the other half for a profit

Looting from Iraq's national museum began under Saddam Hussein as corrupt officials tried to move pieces out of the country, but the main raids came after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.

Curators locked some of the most valuable and cultural pieces in underground storage rooms, but the above ground rooms were ransacked.

In total, officials estimate that 15,000 items were taken, of which about a third have been recovered.

Some items recorded as stolen were later found locked in secret storage units, while others were being kept overseas at the time and were subsequently returned.

Officials added that the damage could have been a lot worse, as most of the thieves were opportunistic, and had little idea of what they were looking for.

Museum curators said many artefacts were saved because thieves did not know what they were looking for. A collection of fake jars were taken, while the valuable real versions, sitting next to them, were untouched

The museum was first opened in 1926 with the help of British author Gertrude Bell, and was subsequently added to via the funding of the German and Italian governments

In one room curators found an entire shelf of worthless fake jars had been taken while the next shelf, containing valuable originals, remained entirely intact, according to the museum's website.

The museum was first opened in 1926 with the help of British author Gertrude Bell, and was subsequently added to via the funding of the German and Italian governments.

The collection covers 7,000 years of history, including rare relics from Mesopotamia - as Iraq was called for much of human history - which is widely considered to be the cradle of civilization.

Pillaging of Iraq's most important archeological sites continues to this day, as the country's weakened security forces are unable to protect them.

Iran has today offered to protect the precious objects, with Mohammad Hassan Talebian, a senior official at Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization, saying he has written to the U.N. offering his country's services for as long as the treasures are at risk.
