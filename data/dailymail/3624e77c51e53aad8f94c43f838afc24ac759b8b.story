David Cameron once famously warned of the potential of Twitter embarrassing politicians.

But in an extraordinary online blunder, the Prime Minister’s official account has managed to offend the victims of the terror attack in Kenya, survivors of the Brighton bombing and Foreign Secretary William Hague.

A tweet, which claims an image of Norman Tebbit being lifted from the Brighton bomb wreckage looked like he was enjoying sex, was apparently ticked as a ‘favourite’ by Mr Cameron.

Blunder: David Cameron's official account listed just one tweet as a 'favourite' - from an account which suggests a photo of Norman Tebbit being lifted from the wreckage of the Brighton bomb looks like he is enjoying sex

Aftermath: Lord Tebbit is treated after the IRA bombing at the Grand Hotel in Brighton

Downing Street struggled to explain the blunder, which came after the PM used the site to pay his respects to the people of Kenya after armed terrorists stormed a Nairobi shopping centre.

The Prime Minister, who once warned 'too many tweets might make a tw*t', wrote that he gave his ‘condolences to President Kenyatta after the attack on the #Westgate shopping centre’ and revealed Mr Hague would give a statement.

The tweet received dozens of responses, including one from a spoof account named @AdrianBurley, although the Tory MP has not connection with the account.

It read: ‘@David_Cameron please call off @WilliamHague, hasn’t Kenya suffered enough today?’

To add 
to the sense of revulsion, the account uses an image of Lord Tebbit 
being lifted from the wreckage of the Brighton bombing in 1984, in which
 five people died and his wife was left disabled.

The revolting name of the account suggests the picture of Lord Tebbit  was taken while having sex.

Norman Tebbit today called for David Cameron to be removed as Tory leader.

In criticism unrelated to the Twitter blunder, the former Conservative party chairman accused Mr Cameron of failing to take the threat of UKIP seriously.

He claimed Mr Cameron's modernisation programme had driven Tory voters away. He told Sky News: 'I think we have to take UKIP seriously because so many ex-Tory voters are attracted to it.

'If I took over a shop in the high street which used to have a lot of customers, and found that the customers were going past my shop and going down the road to a competitor, I wouldn’t do what Ken Clarke has advised which is to stand in the street abusing one’s ex-customers in the hope that that will bring them back into your shop.

'I’d go and see what the other guy was selling, and if I found out it was pretty well what I used to sell in my shop, I think I’d fire the purchasing manager of the shop and get some goods back in that attracted the people in.

'And that’s what the Tory party’s got to do - we’ve got to take seriously why people are attracted to UKIP.'

Someone monitoring Mr Cameron’s 
account then pressed the ‘favourite’ button, making it the only tweet to
 be singled out in this way by the Prime Minister since he joined 
Twitter a year ago.

Downing Street last night said it had been a ‘mistake’, but was unable to say whether the error had been made by Mr Cameron himself or one of his officials.

Lord Tebbit, one of the stars of Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet, was badly injured in the Brighton attack, which killed five and injured dozens.

His wife Margaret was left permanently disabled and he later stepped down from frontline politics to care for her.

The bombing, which took place during the Conservative Party conference, was a deliberate attempt to assassinate the Cabinet.

In the last year Mr Cameron has built up more than 450,000 followers, but has been bombarded by abuse.

A Labour party source said: ‘This is highly offensive to both the victims of the Kenya attack and the Brighton bomb.’

To add to the insensitivity of the Tory error, it emerged just hours before it was announced that at least three Britons were among those killed in Kenya.

Sources said Mr Cameron’s account is used by the Prime Minister himself. But senior officials also have access to it on his behalf.

A spokesman said: ‘This is a deeply offensive account that the Prime Minister would never want to be associated with.

‘Clearly the Tweet was favourited by mistake and was removed as soon as it was realised.’

Its not the first time that Twitter has left Mr Cameron red-faced.

In July he blundered when he apparently confused a Cabinet minister with a spoof Twitter account.

The Prime Minister wrote: 'We're rolling out a cap on Benefits today - @IDS_MP and I are determined to make work pay.'

But @IDS_MP is not Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith but a parody Twitter account mocking the minister.

The clues that the @IDS_MP account was not real were there. The account biography includes 'parodia' and the phrase 'chin chin old bean'.

Previous tweets included: 'I've always supported a Mansion Tax. Your Tax buys my Mansion. Chin chin!'
