Forget apps that track your child’s location, the FiLIP smartwatch not only lets you keep tabs on where they go, it also doubles up as a phone and panic alarm.

Parents can set SafeZones and be alerted when a child leaves these designated areas and locations can be tracked via the FiLIP smartphone app.

Up to five phone numbers can be 
programmed into the device and if the red panic button on the side of 
the watch is pressed, it automatically calls all the numbers in turn to 
alert them that their child may be in danger.

The FiLIP smartwatch, pictured, doubles up as phone so parents can make and receive calls and text messages from their children. Parents can also set 'safe zones' and get alerted if their child leaves these designated areas, via the FiLIP smartphone app. The device costs $199.99 (£121)

FiLIP has a built-in GPS that tracks 
the child’s location. To make tracking more accurate, the watch also 
uses cell-tower triangulation to pinpoint precise 
locations using nearby phone masts.

The display shows the time, incoming text messages and five phone numbers. To switch between menus and numbers, the child presses the blue button on the side of the device. A larger red button, pictured, acts as an Emergency Alarm.

As well as calling the numbers on the 
device, activating the alarm triggers an automatic location beacon 
to be sent to the parent’s phone.

It was created by New York-based father Sten Kirkbak after he lost his child for half an hour.

Kirkbak said: ‘The world used to be a little simpler. Kids ran free and returned at dinnertime, and parents didn’t worry so much.

‘After speaking with other parents, it was clear that there was a need for this type of device to help give children the freedom they need to explore and discover, while staying in touch.’

FiLIP has a built-in GPS sensor that tracks the child’s location.

To make tracking more accurate, the watch also uses what’s called cell-tower triangulation to pinpoint precise locations using network data from nearby phone masts.

FiLIP additionally comes with built-in Wi-Fi that connects to surrounding networks to add an extra level of location accuracy.

The watch comes in green, red, blue and pink. Its display shows the time, incoming text messages and the five pre-programmed phone numbers.

To switch between menus and numbers users can press the blue button on the side of the device. A larger red button acts as the Emergency Alarm and is activated by pressing and holding the button down.

As well as calling the numbers on the device, activating the alarm also triggers an automatic location beacon to be sent to the parent’s phone, and records the watch’s ambient noises. 

FiLIP costs $199.99 (£121) and has launched in the U.S. exclusively on AT&T. The phone can be bought online in other countries but the company has not announced plans for future mobile network partnerships.

It has been created for five to 11-year-olds and the free FiLIP app can be installed on any iPhone or Android device.
