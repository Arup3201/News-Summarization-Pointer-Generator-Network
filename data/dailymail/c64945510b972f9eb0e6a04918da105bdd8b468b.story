Burnished to a deep shine, the iconic Art Deco statuettes at the center of the annual Academy Awards seem the epitome of easy perfection.

But, just like the actors and movie-makers who hold them aloft before the world, the Oscar's iconic statuettes do not face an easy road to their glitzy presentation ceremony in Los Angeles.

Indeed, their road to California's epicenter of celebrity is almost 2,000 miles long, and begins in an outwardly unremarkable Chicago workshop.

There the figures, 13.5 inches tall and a hefty 8.5lbs, are painstakingly manufactured by the skilled craftsmen of R S Owens, who have made the Academy's highest award since 1983.

Although the value of the raw materials is already around $900, once awarded the worth of the statues can catapult - despite an official ban by the academy on selling them on.

The birth of Oscar: The statue, made of five metals, is shown above at each stage of its metal plating. Front-right, the base statuette, made of pewter alloy brittanium, is shown. The figure is then coated in copper (front left) nickel (second row on right), silver (back left) and, finally, the recognizable gold finish (back right)

Although they shine golden, and are clad in a hefty coat of 24-carat gold, at their core an Oscar is made of a variant of pewter - a special alloy called britannium made especially for Oscar figures.

The liquid metal, at a scorching 570°F, is poured into a mold in the shape of a European knight, holding a downward-pointing longsword in both hands.

Each statuette is made individually, and there is only one mold, which is used for every single Oscar. The whole process, according to TIME magazine, takes 10 days from start to finish.

It was first designed by Cedric Gibbons, the art director at MGM, who came up with the first sketches of the Art Deco-style figure in 1928. Each one stands on a reel of film, which has five spokes, to represent the five original branches of the Academy.

At first they were known by their full name, the Academy Award of Merit. The moniker Oscar came later - exactly how is disputed - and was adopted by the Academy in 1939.

Fresh out of the smelter: The awards are seen above straight after being cast at the R S Owens factory in Chicago. After this step they are sanded down, polished and coated with other metals

Burnished: The statues are painstakingly sanded by hand to match their iconic 1928 design. The slightest blemish leads to the figure being scrapped and started over

Row on row: The figure shows a stylized knight wielding a longsword while standing atop a five-spoked reel of film

Plating up: Shown above, R S Owens artisan Nunzio Giganti dips an Oscar into a electro-plating bath to coat the statuette in gold

On the way out: This Oscar is nearing the end of its laborious, ten-day creation process, and is seen in the last electro-plating bath

After being cast, the figures are sanded down then polished until the britannium alloy glimmers - even though it will not be the final coat on display.

The Oscar is then treated to remove any grease of specs of other material, and engraved with a serial number. Around fifty of the awards have been made each year. So far 2,947 have been awarded, with at least 25 more to come Sunday.

Next, the statue is dipped is electro-plated - a chemical technique which creates an even coating - in a metal bath. First the models are coated in copper, then nickel, then silver - and finally in 24-carat gold.

Between each stage the figure is polished again to deepen its luster ahead of the equally glitzy presentation ceremony.

Done deal: The figures are finally attached to a black nickel base - but are left unlabeled until after the ceremony to preserve the secrecy of the winners

For the last step, the Oscar is covered in a lacquer to protect it from knocks and scratches. Finally, they are packaged in Styrofoam and flown under guard to Los Angeles for the final ceremony.

If at any stage in the days-long process an Oscar does not come out perfectly, the figure is destroyed and a new one started to replace it.  

But once the statue is finished, it is guaranteed for life, and actors can send damaged figures back to have them replaced or brought back to their original brilliance.

Eventually each newly-cast Oscar will be affixed with a plaque bearing the name and category of its recipient. At first the statues were taken back by the Academy while the plaques were engraved - but now eager stars can have their statues built up at the ceremony itself.

Oscars themselves are meant then to be a priceless memento for the actors and their families - but time and again winners and heirs have found ways to convert them into cold, hard cash.

Originally there were no restrictions on the Oscar trade, though it was frowned upon. The record sale, a Best Picture award for Gone With The Wind dated 1939, is an astonishing $1.5million, paid by Michael Jackson in 1999.

However, since 1950 the Academy has insisted winners sign a contract promising neither they nor their heirs will try to sell the award without first offering it to them for $1.

But, according to Forbes, the trade has persisted in the shadows, with film collectors buying up awards technically covered by the agreement - which some legal scholars have said would be difficult to actually enforce.

It remains the case, though, that all of the highest sales - eleven of which have exceeded $250,000 - have been of pre-1950s Oscars, which can be traded much more openly in auction houses around the world.
