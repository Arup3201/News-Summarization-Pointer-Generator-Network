A Minnesota doctor may have been shot and killed last week by a man he helped deliver 30 years ago because of a birth defect.

Ted Hoffstrom, 30, may have blamed Dr Stephen Larson, 74, of Orono, for a birth defect which motivated him to shoot the doctor dead.

Mr Hoffstrom's former classmates at the University of St Thomas told Fox Twin Cities that he had 'limitations with his hands' he blamed on the now dead doctor.

The long-time Minneapolis obstetrician and gynecologist had assisted in the birth of Mr Hoffstrom in 1983, and the recently-graduated law student had expressed growing disenchantment with him.

'The suspect had recently expressed hostility to his family members regarding Dr. Larson,' Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said last week during a press briefing.

Officers declined to comment on any possible motive, and, as Fox pointed out, HIPA privacy laws would likely prohibit them from discussing Mr Hoffstrom's medical history.

A former professor of Mr Hoffstrom's was in disbelief over the reported murder.

'This is inexplicable to me,' he told Fox. 'I do not understand this. This is not the student I knew.'

A letter on the door of the home Mr Hoffstrom shared with his parents offered condolences to Dr Larson's family.

Officers responded just before 9pm on Friday to a report of an armed man outside Larson's home on the 1000 block of Heritage Lane.

Shots were fired during a confrontation and the suspect was killed outside the home, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office said. 

Larson was killed before police arrived on the scene and his body was found inside the home, authorities said.

Murder: Dr. Larson of Orono, Minnesota, was found dead inside his home Friday night

Crime scene: It is alleged that Larson went to the doctor's house and shot him. The suspect was then shot dead by police outside the home in Orono, Minnesota

The doctor was home alone at the time of the shooting as his wife was out of town, according to the ABC.

During his 33-year career, colleagues at OBGYN Specialists in Edina and Burnsville estimated he delivered thousands of babies and won numerous awards.

‘There is no way there is anyone who would have any ill will towards him,’ said one of Larson's partners at OBGYN Specialists, Dr Suzin Cho.

The alleged killer’s family posted a note on the front door of their home Sunday, asking people to respect their privacy as they grieve for their son.

The aspiring lawyer had recently passed the Minnesota bar exam, according to St. Paul Pioneer Press.

His family said the shooting was shocking and out of character.

‘It is with great sadness that we extend our heartfelt prayers and sympathy to the family of Dr. Stephen Larson. Our hearts are broken for all of those affected by this tragic event,' said the note.

‘We are shocked and saddened by this news, and many questions remain unanswered. We hope that the public will understand this is a very difficult time for our family,' it continued.

'We are grieving the loss of our son, and ask that you please respect our privacy at this time.’
