An NHL star has sparked outrage after he decapitated a bear before brandishing its head and severed paws for a photograph.

Clayton Stoner, defenseman for Minnesota Wild ice hockey team, posted the photograph of him brandishing the grizzly trophy after a hunting trip last May in an area known as Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia.

The 28-year-old and friends had shot the bear, cut off its head and paws before skinning it and leaving its carcass for scavengers in the forest.

But despite fierce criticism from wildlife campaigners, Stoner was unrepentant yesterday.

'Disgusting': Clayton Stoner, defenseman for Minnesota Wild ice hockey team, posted the photograph of him brandishing the grizzly trophy after a hunting trip last May

In a statement, he said: 'I grew up hunting and fishing in British Columbia and continue to enjoy spending time with my family outdoors.

'I applied for and received a grizzly bear hunting license through a British Columbia limited entry lottery last winter and shot a grizzly bear with my license while hunting with my father, uncle and a friend in May.

'I love to hunt and fish and will continue to do so with my family and friends in British Columbia.'

But local environmentalists lashed out at his strong stance on hunting, branding his actions 'disgusting and barbaric'.

Chief
Stewart Phillip of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs said: 'I don't think
there's any place for this disgusting, barbaric, so-called sport of 
trophy-hunting in British Columbia.'

Unrepentant: Stoner, who plays for Minnesota Wild, refused to bow to critics saying he 'loves' to hunt and would continue to do so

Lucrative: The provincial government hands out 300 licences to hunt grizzly bears each year, an industry that generates more than $300 million in annual revenue

William Housty of the Heiltsuk First Nations urged authorities to ban the bloodsport, adding: 'It's up to Mr Stoner how he wants to proceed from here but we'd encourage him and all other hunters to leave their guns at home.'

The row has reignited passions over an issue that has long divided the state of British Columbia.

The provincial government hands out 300 licences each year. Hunting generates more than $300-million in annual revenue.

Saying Stoner's trophy-hunt made 
him 'sick and angry', Jason Moody of the Nuxalk First Nation urged the hockey player to return with a camera 
instead of a gun.

'I want to talk to him,' he said. 'I want to try to change his mind 
-- I think it's a bad habit that he's got that's maybe been taught to 
him.'

Stoner, who is 6"4' and has an official hunting licence, finished last season with 10 assists in 48 games for Minnesota Wild.
