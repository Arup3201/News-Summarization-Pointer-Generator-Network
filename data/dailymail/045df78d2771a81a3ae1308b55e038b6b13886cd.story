After a Senate committee revealed last month that Apple skirted billions in taxes by stashing cash in offshore tax havens, the company quickly became the poster child of big businesses that take advantage of dramatically lower corporate tax rates around the world. But it turns out Apple isn't alone - according to a new report, 18 of the largest companies in the U.S. avoid paying U.S. taxes in the exact same way, dodging an estimated $92 billion, collectively.

According to the report, conducted by the tax-advocacy organization Citizens for Tax Justice, 18 of the U.S.' Fortune 500 companies - like Nike, Microsoft, American Express and Oracle - disclose information in their annual financial reports that indicates that they keep billions of dollars in profits offshore where corporate tax rates can be in single-digit percentages.

In the Bahamas, for example, the corporate tax rate is zero. If the companies were to keep their money in the U.S., they would be subject to corporate tax rates ranging from 30-percent to 39-percent.

The CTJ says places like Bermuda and the Caymen Islands are likely the locations of choice for many of the tax-skirting corporations to stash their money.

Under current U.S. tax code, large corporations can indefinitely defer paying U.S. income taxes on their offshore profits. It's not until the money is repatriated that the U.S. can apply any taxes to any corporate profits - and that's assuming that these corporations ever bring the money back to the U.S.

Even when the money is brought back into the country, corporations rarely pay the full corporate tax rate on profits they've kept offshore to the U.S. - companies are allowed a “foreign tax credit” against their U.S. tax when 
and if the profits are subject to U.S. tax. This means that a company that pays a 25-percent tax rate on income it's kept offshore - to a foreign government - would only have to pay a 10-percent tax rate if it brings the money back into the United States.

Cha-ching!

But the CTJ also found that 22 companies that don't disclose where they keep their money hold an estimated $720 billion in un-repatriated income. Topping that list is General Electric, which holds roughly $110 billion in places like the Bahamas, Bermuda, Ireland and Singapore. Pfizerr got the number two spot, with $73 billion spread between Ireland, Bermuda, the Caymen Islands and several other low-tax nations.

Because stashing money in places that have low corporate income tax rates isn't illegal, and because the CEOs of these companies report to stockholders, business experts have said that for a company to not squirrel money away in places with low tax rates would be the equivalent of corporate malpractice. 

But lawmakers are attempting to fix the loopholes that allows these companies to duck paying taxes.

Several of the corporations on the CTJ's list have suggested granting a holiday on taxes for companies that want to repatriate their income that's currently being kept overseas.
