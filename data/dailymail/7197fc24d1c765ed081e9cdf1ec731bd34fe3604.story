Britain is still drying out from the wettest winter ever recorded. But the ferocious series of storms that ceaselessly batter the country should seem a distant memory today – as temperatures soar to an impressive 63F (17C).

The Met Office forecast the south of England would hit that balmy figure by mid afternoon, with areas of the north not far behind at 61F (16C).

The highs could better those for European hotspots such as Barcelona – and Britons are expected to head to the coast in droves.

In further evidence the country is emerging from its long winter gloom, stores announced a big jump in the sale of summer accessories.

John Lewis reported sales of sunglasses were 173 per cent higher that last year, with barbecues and gardening equipment up 11 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘We have already seen shoppers snapping up products to make the most of the early spring weather.’

The Met Office says the good weather is likely to persist this week, although temperatures are expected to drop to around 14C (57F) in the south of England and 11C (52F) in the north.

But forecasters warn that the warm conditions might only last until Friday, when wind and rain may return. ‘It won’t be nearly as bad as we have experienced in recent months, however,’ a Met Office spokesman said.

People took advantage of the fine spell yesterday by punting on the River Cam in Cambridge and basking on the beaches of Brighton, Bournemouth and Great Yarmouth.

The West Country, which bore the brunt
 of storms and flooding, was yesterday basking under cloudless skies, 
although there is still flood water in parts of  the country, including 
the Somerset Levels.

At 
Woolacombe, North Devon, where wartime defences have been exposed 
following weeks of tidal pounding, local bars and restaurants reported 
brisk business.

And at 
Porthcothan beach near Padstow, Cornwall, where a storm shattered the 
iconic rock arch, the cliff paths were busy with walkers.

‘It’s
 still early season but when you get lovely weather like this, people 
always head for the coast,’ said Bob Wyatt of Porthcothan Bay stores.

However
 some businesses were unable to take advantage. The Red Rock Cafe in 
Dawlish, South Devon, where the mainline railway was shattered by a 
storm surge, is still months away from re-opening.
