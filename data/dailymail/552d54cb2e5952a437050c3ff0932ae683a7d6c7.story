David Cameron will go to Edinburgh today to start the countdown to a referendum on Scottish independence.

But he faces criticism back in London that he has given too much ground to the Nationalists by agreeing to most of their demands on how the historic vote should be handled.

Lord Forsyth, a former Scottish Secretary, compared Mr Cameron to Pontius Pilate for handing over key decisions on the ballot to SNP first minister Alex Salmond, rather like the Biblical story of the Roman prefect of Judea acceding to the wish of Jewish leaders that Jesus should be put to death.

Although the Prime Minister has forced Mr Salmond to drop a second question on increased devolution short of independence, he has agreed to let Mr Salmond suggest the wording of the question, to delay the vote until 2014 and to enable 16 and 17-year-olds to vote.

The pair will meet today to sign an agreement on the holding of a referendum. The deal, reached following months of negotiations about the ballot, will grant the Scottish Parliament the power to stage the historic vote.

The Prime Minister will say: 'Scotland's two governments have come together to deliver a referendum which will be legal, fair and decisive. This marks the beginning of an important chapter in Scotland's story and allows the real debate to begin.

'It paves the way so that the biggest question of all can be settled: a separate Scotland or a United Kingdom? I will be making a very positive argument for our United Kingdom.

'It is now up to the people of Scotland 
to make that historic decision. The very future of Scotland depends on 
their verdict. It is that important. This agreement delivers the 
people's referendum.'

But Lord Forsyth said Mr Cameron had given too much away as a result of appalling negotiating skills.

He told the Sunday Times: 'Salmond has been able to get what he wants. If that's called a negotiation, that's stretching the language. It sounds like a walkover to me.'

'What is going on here is the prime minister is Pontius Pilate. He is just saying, over to you, Alex. Once that order is passed it's a matter for Alex Salmond so he is going to dictate the terms'

Lord Forsyth said the expected wording of the question - Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? - was loaded and could swing the vote towards the SNP.

'What is going on here is the prime minister is Pontius Pilate. He is just saying, over to you, Alex. Once that order is passed it's a matter for Alex Salmond so he is going to dictate the terms.'

Former chancellor Alistair Darling, who is leading the cross-party Better Together campaign, also criticised aspects of the deal.

'I would have preferred to have had this 
referendum in the autumn of 2013 because frankly a two-year election 
campaign is going to try the patience of the public, never mind the 
politicians and those who write about it,' he said.

'In relation to 16 and 17-year-olds I personally don't think you should change the franchise for one particular referendum or election.'

Mr Salmond's deputy Nicola Sturgeon claimed victory, saying: 'If you consider issues over the timing, the question, the franchise, all issues which at the start of the year David Cameron was making noises about; all of these things will now be determined by the Scottish Parliament. I think that is a very good outcome.'

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said: 'I think it's a good agreement. I believe it will now allow us to put up in lights the big issues about the big debate on what is best for Scotland.

'I believe that when we look at the economy, at defence, at our place in the world, on all these big issues people across Scotland will continue to support Scotland being in the United Kingdom.'

The most recent poll on independence suggests support for leaving the UK has dropped. A survey of 995 adults, published last week, showed support for the Union at 53 per cent compared with support for independence at 28 per cent.
