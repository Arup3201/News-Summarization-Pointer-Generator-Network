In a statement ABC managing director Mark Scott said Ms Young was an unforgettable communicator and a passionate advocate.

'Stella helped us understand disability issues by sharing with a raw honesty about her own life and forcing us to reconsider how we think about disability and create an environment where those with disability can best get on with their own lives,' Mr Scott said.

'She took great delight in challenging conventional wisdom and lazy thinking.

'It is so hard to believe we have all lost Stella at such a young age. She was so talented, so widely loved and respected.'

Just a few weeks ago, Ms Young vowed to do all she could to meet her 80-year-old self.

But the comedian, writer and high-profile disability activist was painfully aware she might not make it.

She was described as taking great delight in challenging 'conventional wisdom' and 'lazy thinking'

'I can't tell you for certain that you and I will ever meet,' she said in a letter to her octogenarian self, published in the book Women Of Letters.

'Perhaps that thing I always say flippantly, usually with a third glass of wine in my hand - that I'm here for a good time not a long time - perhaps that's true.

'But on my path to reach you, I promise to grab every opportunity with both hands, to say yes as often as I can, to take risks, to scare myself stupid, and to have a s***load of fun.'

Three days before she died, the comedian, journalist and activist was still busy trying to change people's perceptions of disability.

Ms Young was the headliner at the NSW government's comedy cabaret night No Offence, But! in Sydney last Wednesday to celebrate international day for people with disabilities.

Ms Young is being remembered for the way she confronted stereotypes, especially during a TEDx talk she gave in Sydney in April.

In her address, Ms Young hit out at able-bodied people who use disabled people as 'inspiration porn' to motivate themselves. 

The comedian said the lie that living with a disability makes you inspirational is a 'great injustice' and actually makes life harder for disabled people

'I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational. They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember by own name,' she said. 

The comedian and writer said the lie that living with a disability makes you inspirational is a 'great injustice' and actually makes life harder for disabled people.

'Lots of disabled people have said that they've always felt like this and never been able to put their finger on why it makes them feel uncomfortable,' Ms Young told Daily Mail Australia following her talk this year.

'Almost as many have disagreed and that's fine! We're a wildly diverse mob.' 

Young was born in Stawell, Victoria in 1982 with Osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition that causes bones to break easily.

She set out as a teenager to change the world, auditing businesses in Stawell's main street for their accessibility.

At 17 she 'came out' as a disabled woman and started calling herself a 'crip' - 'a word that makes me feel strong and powerful', she explained.

Ms Young made her start as a journalist on community television station Channel 31 and most recently worked for ABC Radio and TV. 

Ms Young was born with the condition Osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease 

She was the founding editor of the ABC's Ramp Up website dedicated to news, opinion and discussion about disability.

The website launched in 2010 but was shut down this year after its funding was cut in the Federal Budget. Ms Young stayed working with the ABC as regular contributor to The Drum, online, radio and television.

She was a two-time state finalist in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival's Raw Comedy competition.

Her debut show Tales from the Crip won the Best Newcomer Award at the 2014 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and she was preparing to tour it nationally and to the Soho Theatre in London in 2015.

Ms Young was a member of the Victorian Disability Advisory Council, Ministerial Advisory Council for the Department of Victorian communities and Women With Disabilities Victoria.

She recently toured the United States at the request of the US government, who saw her as a future world leader on disability and other issues.

Fellow comedians, columnists and disability advocates including Josh Thomas, Charlie Pickering, Kurt Fearnley and Adam Spencer have led the outpouring of tributes to Ms Young on Twitter.
