The Australian bride charged with adultery and bigamy offences while visiting her boyfriend in Lebanon has tearfully told of how she was scared her new man would leave her.

'He risked his whole life for me,' Sydney mother Mahassen Issa told Channel Seven's Sunday Night program, in an interview to air at the weekend.

''I was honestly scared that he would, because anyone would run - I would!'

'If I was in a predicament like that and I was going to jail I would run.

'(But) he didn't. I never left him and he didn't leave me.'

Distressing time: Ms Issa spent around two months on the run from Lebanese authorities. She has sat down for an interview with the Seven Network's Sunday Night program

Dressed in white and wielding a bouquet of roses, Ms Issa entered a commitment ceremony with her new partner, Mohammed Awick. The pictures, posted online, would lead to her being accused of bigamy

'In love': Sunday Night reporter Steve Pennells told Daily Mail Australia Ms Issa and Mr Awick have a very real relationship

While there were conflicting reports over whether Ms Issa was charged with bigamy and adultery charges, Mr Pennells said she faced both

Having separated from her husband, Bassam Abou Lokmeh, Ms Issa travelled to Lebanon on June 20 and met her new partner, Mohammed Awick.

Mr Lokmeh saw pictures of Ms Issa and Mr Awick allegedly marrying in early July and alerted authorities, beginning a months-long hunt for Ms Issa.

But Ms Issa told Sunday Night the pictures were actually of a commitment ceremony, rather than a wedding.

Reporter Steve Pennells, who travelled with Ms Issa during her time on the run, said she was desperate and at risk of 'real danger' while in Lebanon.

'At times, she was frantic, scared and demoralised, verging on hysterical - she was pushed to the edge,' Mr Pennells said.  

Dark times: While stuck in Lebanon, Ms Issa heard rumours her home had been rented out without her consent

When Ms Issa, pictured here with partner Mohammed Awick, travelled to Lebanon in June she only expected to stay for two weeks

Ms Issa was 'disowned' by her family while she was marooned in Lebanon

Ms Issa, who was only meant to stay in Lebanon for two weeks, was unable to see or talk to her two children, both under the age of 10. 

She had no money, Mr Pennells said, and even heard reports her house had been rented out without her consent and possessions taken or sold. 

In July, husband Mr Lokmeh told Daily Mail Australia his wife was 'a devil... This lady, she's a devil.'

He expressed outrage that his wife had married another man before their divorce was finalised and had 'deserted our children'. 

Relatives said they had 'disowned' her, with one telling Daily Mail Australia Ms Issa was crying so sympathetic Australians would come to her aid.

'We tried to put a stop to it but she decided to proceed with her marriage in Lebanon...now it has backfired on her.

'She's not going to jail because of adultery, she's going to jail because she got married while she was still married. 

'That's illegal everywhere, not just in Lebanon. All she's doing is crying out for Australia to help her.'  

Ms Issa resurfaced in Australia in earlier this month.

It remains unclear how she returned as her passport was 'flagged' by the Lebanese Government following the charges.

Ms Issa applied to bring an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against Mr Lokmeh at Bankstown Local Court on October 9, but her application was dismissed. 

Sunday Night marketing material said Ms Issa experienced 'the biggest, most shocking, unexpected twist of all' when she returned to Australia.  

At the heart of Ms Issa's saga, Mr Pennells said, was a 'very, very messy break-up story'.
