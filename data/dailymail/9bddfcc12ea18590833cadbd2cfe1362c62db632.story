The family of a Texan killed during the gas plant hostage crisis today criticised the Algerian military for not waiting for back-up before launching their botched assault which left dozens of captives dead.

Victor Lovelady, 57, a project manager for the Houston-based energy firm ENGlobal Corporation, was one of three Americans who died during the stand-off at the In Aminas plant last week.

Around 30 hostages and 15 Al Qaeda gunmen are thought to have died when Algerian helicopters strafed the plant on the second day of the siege just hours after the terrorists threatened to detonate explosives if the authorities intervened.

Criticial: Mike Lovelady and his niece Erin Lovelady have accused the Algerian forces of acting too hastily in storming the BP gas plant where their brother and father, Victor Lovelady, died during the siege

'We could have done better': Erin Lovelady believes her father, Victor (right) may have survived if Algerian troops had waited for support from U.S. and British special forces to launch an 'all-out military assault'

The four-day siege then reached its bloody climax when seven workers were executed by their Al Qaeda-linked captors when Algerian special forces stormed the desert facility on Saturday.

The botched action took place as an 
unarmed American surveillance drone soared overhead - yet the Algerian 
government had refused offers of help from America and Britain's crack 
special forces as they tried to overcome one of the biggest kidnappings 
ever seen in Africa.

Mr Lovelady's older brother Mike said: 'My brother should not have had to die this way.'

While details of Mr Lovelady's death remain unclear, his family said the Algerian troops should have waited for support from British or U.S. special forces.

Hands up: This is the moment the gas plant workers surrendered to Al Qaeda militants after they stormed the facility in the early hours of last Wednesday morning

His daughter Erin, 27, told MyFoxHouston: 'I think we could have done better than with an all-out military assault. That's my personal feeling.'

She said Mr Lovelady was assured the gas field was safe before he took the job and did so because it would allow him to take one-month periods of time off to see his loved ones.

'There are no words. When I was upset I could call him. I don't have that anymore.'

Victor Lovelady was one of three Americans who died during the stand-off at the plant in In Aminas last week

Two other Americans also died in the 
siege - fellow Texan Frederick Buttaccio and Gordon Lee Rowan - while 
seven made it out safely.

A total of 37 foreign workers are believed to have died at the remote desert facility - part-operated by BP - which was overrun by heavily-armed terrorists.

Some 29 of the hostage-takers died, while three were captured by Algerian troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand off.

Work was continuing today to locate and identify five foreign workers who remain unaccounted for.
