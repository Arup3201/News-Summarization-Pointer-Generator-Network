Two officers in uniform smile proudly for the camera as World War One rages just a few miles away in these newly-unearthed photographs.

But all is not as it seems in this fascinating yet seemingly innocuous image, believed to have been taken in October 1916.

The young officer saluting and wearing a New Zealand uniform and distinctive 'lemon-squeezer' hat is, in fact, a woman.

This image is not of a young, fresh-faced officer in World War One, but a mystery French woman

Lovers or friends? Little evidence about the pair's relationship exists. The pictures seem playful, even intimate, and suggest two people at ease with one another

The discovery of the image has sparked excitement and no little speculation among Great War scholars, who believe they have identified the male officer in the pictures. But mystery still surrounds the identity of the woman, believed to be French and in her late twenties to early thirties.

The intimacy of the photos suggest a deep friendship - and possibly even more - between the New Zealand officer and the vivacious, evidently modern lady.

He is believed to be Captain Albert Arthur Chapman, born in Tasmania, Australia, in March 1880, and therefore 36 to 38 at the time of the photographs. He was identified from his collar and cap badges as a member of the 7th Southland Mounted Rifles.

His companion has put on his first lieutenant's tunic, his New Zealand Division hat, his baggy officer's trousers, belts, puttees and even his spurs. Intriguingly, she has an engagement or wedding ring on her left hand.

Speculation also arises from the picture where she is sat on the dashing officer's knee, her hand placed tenderly on his shoulder.

New Zealand historian Andrew Macdonald believes he has correctly identified the officer.

He said: 'In the records of the New Zealand Pioneer (Maori) Battalion there are only two officers who meet these criteria. One of these did not reach the rank of captain, leaving Albert Arthur Chapman as the prime candidate'.

'His service record fits the man in these images like a glove. He was transferred from the Pioneer Battalion to serve with the New Zealand division headquarter staff behind the lines of the Somme in April, May and June 1916. He was transferred back to the same Pioneer battalion when the New Zealand Division entered the battle [from 15 September].

Transformation: In this photograph it becomes clear that the young officer is actually a woman. But the true nature of the couple's relationship is lost in the mists and murk of the Great War

'He was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1916. He won the Military Cross in June 1918.'

The building seen in the background of the garden shots has been identified by a local historian and blogger, Frédéric Bellegeulle, as the 'Villa des Acacias' on the Rue Saint Denis in Hallencourt, near Abbeville.

The pictures were found among a batch of 21 glass photographic plates, found in Hallencourt, 30 miles east of the battlefields of 1916, unearthed as part of The Independent's series of  'lost images' of the First World War.

Dominique Zanardi, proprietor of the 
'Tommy' café in Pozières in the heart of the Somme battlefield, was the 
first to realise the young officer and the woman were one and the same.

Captain Chapman must have visited the woman at least twice because the images show him as both a first lieutenant and later as a captain. Little more than that is known.

Is the ring on her finger an engagement ring from Chapman or her wedding ring? Had her husband died in the fighting? Was he still at war?

One thing we know for sure - Chapman returned unmarried to New Zealand. Somewhere along the way their relationship, whatever it was, ended.

There is one final theory, almost impossibly tragic yet not beyond the realms of possibility. A flu pandemic swept Francein 1918, killing 400,000. Among that grim toll was a sixth of Hallencourt's population.

Did he return to New Zealand heartbroken and in mourning? Records show Captain Chapman never married.

Was he never able to recover from losing this playful, smiling woman, forever nursing bittersweet memories of an impossibly bright afternoon in a foreign garden?

We may never know.
