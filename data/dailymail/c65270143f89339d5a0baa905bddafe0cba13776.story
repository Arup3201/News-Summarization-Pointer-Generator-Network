Crystal Palace mascot Kayla the eagle may be facing an uncertain future at the club but she seemed more than happy to be pictured with manager Alan Pardew on Saturday.

The bald eagle's home Eagle Heights Wildlife Foundation has fallen into financial mire and faces closure, meaning Kayla would no longer be able to attend matches at Selhurst Park.

But it didn't stop her from performing her pre-match duties ahead of the crunch Premier League clash between Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers.

Kayla happily posed with boss Pardew as well BT Sport presenter Rachel Stringer before her customary outing in front of the Selhurst Park crowd prior to kick-off.

But her appearances at the club are under threat unless the wildlife park are able to raise £10,000 in emergency funding to remain open until the summer.

Kayla made her first appearance at Palace back in 2010 and Eagle Heights have urged supporters to each donate £1 to save the foundation and safeguard Kayla's future at Selhurst Park.

Kayla's handler Chris Belsey told News Shopper in February: 'It is a horrible situation for us. We are a small family-run business, we've been open for 19 years.

'The animals are pretty much going unless we get serious funds now. It could happen in the next week or so.

'I am hopeful that people can help and that we will be here in the summer, then we can have a good financial boost.

'We've already had to close the reptile house. It looks like the camel will have to go, if things get any worse, the bird will have to go as well.'

Anyone wanting to donate to save Eagle Heights Wildlife Foundation can do so here.
