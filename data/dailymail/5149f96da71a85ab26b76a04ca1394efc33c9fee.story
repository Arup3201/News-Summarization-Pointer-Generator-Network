It's the golden rule when appearing on live television - always turn your mobile off.

But Tory grandee Lord Heseltine clearly forgot when he was on the BBC's Question Time last night, and his wife Ann called.

The former deputy prime minister was outlining a complicated defence of the Government's economic strategy and its deficit reduction programme at St Paul’s Cathedral when his phone rang.

Golden rule: Lord Heseltine with his mobile phone that rang as he was on the Question Time panel

He was in the middle of saying: 'The reason why the deficit is continuing is because the Government has decided that it will not cut the health service.

'The welfare system is being preserved very largely intact...' The argument was then broken by the sound of a mobile phone ring tone.

'... very largely intact... Vince’s point is right... ' stammered Lord Heseltine, with a flicker of alarm in his eyes, edging his hand surreptitiously towards his jacket.

'There’s a telephone going off!' cried host David Dimbleby, prompting laughter from the audience and fellow panel members, including Business Secretary Vince Cable.

It's for you: Lord Heseltine was in the middle of outlining an argument about the Government's economic policy

Rev Giles Fraser peered at the screen before saying: 'Who is that? It¿s your wife! Is that your wife?'

Lord Heseltine, 79, was joined by Vince Cable on the panel for the show broadcast from St Paul's Cathedral in London

Lord Heseltine, 79, grinned and 
pulled his iPhone from the top pocket of his suit and spent several 
seconds fiddling with it to silence it.

Fellow panellist the Rev Giles Fraser
peered at the screen before saying: 'Who is that? It’s your wife! Is 
that your wife? You have gone off-message.'

As the audience laughed, Lord Heseltine stammered 'I, I, I' in an attempt to carry on. Then, he said: 'My wife is supporting what I have been saying, she is just letting me know.'

The audience applauded and Twitter was quickly full of comments, ranging from 'Heseltine apparently knows how to fix the economy, but not how to turn his phone off on live television' to 'best #bbcqt moment ever!'
