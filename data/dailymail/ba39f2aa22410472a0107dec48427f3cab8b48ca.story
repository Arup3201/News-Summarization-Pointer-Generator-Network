One Pound Jimmy: The stamp features  Indigenous Australian Gwoya Jungarai and was first issued in 1950. The shape of his head as it appears on the stamp was used to create the shape of a pool and open space of roof in a futuristic north Queensland home

Nestled deep in Queensland's Daintree rainforest sits a futuristic pod-like six-bedroom house on a man-made lake, inspired by its owners' passion for stamp collecting.

Influenced by stamps inside and out, the centrepiece of the home is a swimming pool in the middle of the structure, based on the figure head of the One Pound Jimmy stamp.

Dubbed the stamp house by architect Charles Wright, who designed it, he said the influences evolved after a conversation with his stamp collector clients and owners Rodney and Marider Perry.

'It's Rod's favourite Australian stamp - it's not particularly valuable I don't think, it's just one of his favourite, so the figure head in the in the stamp was used to create the central focus feature of the house,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

The One Pound Jimmy was a stamp featuring Gwoya Jungarai, who was the first Indigenous Australian to be featured on a stamp when it was first issued in 1950. A picture of him is also featured on the $2 coin.

The figure head shape is reflected in the open court yard roof above the pool and the cut out gardened area around it. 'The stamp idea is central, it's all about how spaces oscillate around the pool'.

With each of the bedrooms in the pod-like arms of the building opening to the pool and courtyard area, this strikes a balance between the public and private areas of the house, Mr Wright said.

The stamp-theme continues onto the exterior of the building, where perforations based stamp sheets cover the concrete steel-reinforced cyclone proof walls. 'It's almost as if the house has been gift wrapped,' Mr Wright said.

Because the house is located in a lake, the exterior and the perforations are reflected back into the building.

Located on 26 hectares and with a 600-metre private beach front, one of northern Queensland's largest, the man-made lake was inspired by Marider, who is originally from the Philippines, and the long tradition of South East Asian and Filipino people living over water.

The 'stamp house' was inspired inside and out after conversations between the architect and the stamp collector owners and architect Charles Wright's unique design won the top award at the Queensland Architecture Awards on Friday and will go on to compete at the national competition

Centrepiece: The focal point of the home is a swimming pool based on the figure head of the One Pound Jimmy postage stamp issued in the 1950s. The stamp is owner Rodney Perry's favourite, and the shape is used in the roof of the open air courtyard and a cut out garden area around the pool

Mr Wright said this was another example of how his conversations with his clients, who gave him no brief, influenced the design of the house and how these were extrapolated into a larger idea. The lake also enables the surrounding forest to be reflected back into the house.

Because of its sensitive location, the house is 100 per cent 'green' and completely off grid with no power, water or sewer. This sees it produce its own electricity, water and process waste including sewerage.

'It generates all of its own renewable energy through solar,' Mr Wright said. 'There are solar panels... and batteries. The house harvests all its own water through the roof and treats all of its own waste. Its carbon neutral in operation,' Mr Wright said. The water harvesting facility is located under the swimming pool.

Mr Wright said the house's pod-like form was was based on a resort-style prototype based on relationship between public and private spaces within the home.

On Friday, the house was awarded the Robin Dods Award for Residential Architecture - House (New) at the Australian Institute of Architects' Queensland Architecture Awards, the top award of the night.

Mr Wright said winning was amazing. 'We were thrilled the result - the recognition from our peers that it was all worthy of what we were trying to do,' he said.

Despite the house receiving its occupancy certification in December 2012, with the finishing touches still being completed after this date, Mr Wright did not enter it into the competition until this year.

The exterior of the home also reflects the owner's passion for stamp collecting, with the perforated walls based on stamp sheets and creating a 'gift wrapped' effect

Called Alkira by its owners, the house is set on 26 hectares is currently for sale and due to be relisted for $25 million. The property also features about 600 metres of beach front, one of the biggest private beaches in north Queensland

The win will see the house entered into the National Architecture Awards to be announced in Darwin on November 6, against other winners from each state and territory. 'I don't know what it's up against... but national-level is pretty high so I'm sure there will be a range of high-quality homes vying to win. The competition will be tough.'

Mr Wright, said both the clients and the five-year project were 'one in a million'. 'All our projects, we like them to be about the clients or the organisation we are dealing with.' He added that the clients' interests directly influence his firm's work.

He said his clients were also 'thrilled with the finished product'. 'It's amazing that the original concept and design is what that have got - and they are loving it.'

'From our point of view its great. We had this idea that was a bit way out all these years ago and to have it now finished and crystallised into reality us quite unique.'

Building a house in the middle of the Daintree rainforest meant there was an 'extensive' planning and approval process to build in such a sensitive area, but Mr Wright said it was 'worth it in the end'.

Called Alkira, by its owners, the house is for sale and is due to be relisted for about $15 million. It is currently lived in and also available to be rented as an executive retreat and is believed to have cost the owners about $9 million to purchase the land and build the house.

Mr Wright's firm, Charles Wright Architects was established 10 years ago and he has worked as an architect for about 14 years. Originally from Melbourne, the 39-year-old is based in Port Douglas in Queensland.

With the house located on a man-made lake inspired by South East Asian floating homes, the reflection of the perforated exterior reflects back into the building, as does the lush Daintree forest surrounding it

Carbon neutral: Because if its sensitive location in the middle of pristine rainforest on the Queensland coast, the house generates its own renewable energy through solar, harvests its own water and treats its own waste
