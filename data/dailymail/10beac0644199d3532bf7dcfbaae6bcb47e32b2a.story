The drug-dependent daughter of Coronation Street star Johnny Briggs has been jailed and his heroin addict granddaughter remanded in custody after both admitted shoplifting.

Karen Briggs and her daughter Emma Beach - who are both drug addicts and have notched up 48 convictions between them - admitted stealing candles, valued at £400, from a Clinton Cards store in Surrey.

Briggs, 48, was jailed for six months, after also confessing to taking a neighbour's parcel.

Daughter of Coronation Street actor Johnny Briggs, Karen Briggs, left and his granddaughter Emma Beach,  right, appeared at Guildford Crown Court for sentencing today. Briggs was jailed for six months, while Judge Peter Moss deferred Beach's sentence, while he considers a drug treatment programme

Her daughter Beach - the granddaughter of the Corrie actor, who played Mike Baldwin for 36 years - had her sentence deferred, while the judge explored rehab options.

Judge Peter Moss, presiding over the hearing at Guildford Crown Court, questioned whether the 25-year-old heroin addict would be suitable for a drug treatment programme.

But he told the court he was concerned he might be 'setting her up to fail'.

He told her lawyer: 'I’m sure she would love it if somebody would wave a magic wand and she would no longer be addicted to heroin.

'I don’t own that magic wand.'

Prosecutor Gino Connor told the court: 'On September 30 last year, at Clinton Cards in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, one of the assistants noticed two females.

'They went straight to the display of the Yankee Candles. They were in the store for about 10 minutes and were being observed.

'The observer noticed a rustling of bags and thought items were being packed in the bags.'

The shop worker then watched as the older woman left the store, said Mr Connor.

Actor Johnny Briggs, pictured collecting an MBE from the Queen in 2007, played Mike Baldwin in Coronation Street from 1976 to 2012. His daughter Karen Briggs revealed in court he has undergone a prostate operation and test for skin cancer

'When she looked at the display she could see the display looked empty, with only three candles remaining,' he added.

He told the court, by this time, the younger woman had also fled the shop.

Police were called to the shop and descriptions of the women were provided by staff.

Briggs and Beach were arrested around a month later, when police officers pulled over a green Ford Fiesta.

The car was being driven by Beach, 25, and her mother Briggs was in the passenger seat.

Officers noted a number of Yankee Candles in the foot well of the passenger seat.

Briggs claimed the candles had been bought at a car boot sale, with the intention of selling them on at another sale.

However, officers who knew the pair because of their history of drug-related thefts arrested Briggs after spotting the parcel addressed to another woman in the boot of the car.

The parcel was intended for Linda Warner, a neighbour of Briggs and Beach in Cobham, Surrey.

Both defendants denied the charges against them and opted to be tried by a jury at crown court.

But the pair entered last minute guilty pleas, admitting stealing the candles.

Judge Moss was told both women have extensive criminal pasts related to their class A drug habits.

Briggs had 32 convictions for 52 offences, while her daughter had 16 convictions for 23 offences.

Andrew Forsyth, representing Beach, said: 'She is thoroughly ashamed of her record. She has explained it’s time to grow up.

'Miss Beach has not had the easiest start to life.

'She wants to change. She has said she feels she may have a chance away from her mother.'

Di Middleton, mitigating for Briggs, said her client was ashamed by what she had done.

'Her circumstances are slightly unusual. You will see reference (in the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report) to an unusual upbringing - some issues regarding childhood.

'Her father is an extremely well-known figure in television. She’s extremely ashamed at what she has done to her family and what she has done to her daughter.

'Nothing could be harder for her to see her daughter reduced to the same circumstances, with her as this poor role model, rather than her grandfather as this very good role model.'

She said Briggs is keen to rebuild broken relationships with her family, including her father, who she said has faced a prostate operation as well as tests for skin cancer.

Judge Moss told Beach he would put back her sentencing for three weeks to see if she were deemed suitable for a drug rehabilitation referral and that she would stay in custody until then.

He said to Briggs that taking her neighbour’s parcel had been 'a mean offence'.

'You are addicted to drugs and you have many, many previous convictions for shoplifting,' he said.

'The reality is this is a case which is effectively one of repeat offending, in relation to shoplifting, no doubt to feed your drug habit.

'I’m told you have what are described as unresolved issues regarding your parents and you bear responsibility for the situation as regards your daughter.'

He added: 'It is plainly a custody matter and the sentence I impose is one of 18 weeks for the candles, and for the package, six weeks consecutive, making a total of 24 weeks.'

He refrained from making Briggs and Beach paying costs or compensation, after taking into account their financial situation.

In the last year the curse of the cobbles has struck, with cast members suffering a string of scandals, from sex allegations to real-life love splits and big names fleeing Weatherfield for good.

Michael Le Vell, who has played Kevin Webster for 30 years, was suspended after police charged him with 19 sex offences involving a child.

During last year’s trial, Michael admitted he was an alcoholic who drank up to 12 pints a night during his 30-year soap career.

He was cleared of all charages by a jury at Manchester Crown Court in September.

He
 is due back on TV at the end of March as garage mechanic Kevin, who is 
reportedly set to rebuild his relationship with ex-wife Sally, played by
 Sally Dynevor, who has meanwhile been dating Tim Metcalfe.

His
 ordeal was followed by that of veteran co-star Bill Roache, who has 
played Ken Barlow since the first episode aired in December 1960.

Jurors unanimously cleared the 81-year-old of rape and indecent assault at Preston Crown Court this month.

He
 became the third cast member to be cleared of sex offences in the last 
year. Andrew Lancel who played Frank Foster was cleared of four counts 
of indecent assault on a teenager in 1994 in June last year.

He is set to return to the soap later this summer.

For a string of stars the last year has seen real-life relationships come to an end.

Actress Shobna Gulati, who played Sunita Alahan for nine years, was said to be devastated last year when she split up from her boyfriend. The 46-year-old split with Tony Brown, 29m an ITV runner. She is known by Corrie fans as barmaid Eva Price and on screen the actress has been unlucky in love. For Catherine Tyldesley her life has reflected her art. Early in 2013 the actress split from her boyfriend Sam Witter, after reportedly telling him she was keen to start a family.Kym Lomas, 37, who plays Michelle Connor, separated from her actor husband Jamie.The 33-year-old starred in Holyoaks but more recently has appeared in Corrie's rival Eastenders. The couple, who are parents to two-year-old Polly, had been together for five years.Co-star Michelle Keegan split with her fiance, front man Max George of The Wanted fame. Rumours circulated the 24-year-old singer cheat on his girlfriend. She has since become engaged to Towie star Mark Wright.Aside from the love bust ups, stars of the ITV show, were shamed after being caught in a Channel 4 sting which exposed them promoting free products on social networking sites.Brooke Vincent who plays Sophie Webster was caught up in the scandal. But she was not alone. Co-stars Georgia May Foote, who plays Katy Armstrong, and Catherine Tyldesley were also duped.
