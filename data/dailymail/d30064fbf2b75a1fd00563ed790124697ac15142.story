Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has branded Cliven Bundy a 'terrorist' and said a federal taskforce has been set up to deal with him

Senator Harry Reid has branded Nevada's last cattle rancher Cliven Bundy and his supporters 'domestic terrorists' who do not respect America.

He added that a federal taskforce was being setup to deal with Bundy, who is accused of not paying federal grazing taxes for his cattle for 20 years, and reportedly owes the government $1million.

The Bureau of Land Management tried to round up Bundy's cattle last weekend, but were forced to back down after hundreds of supporters, some carrying automatic weapons and sniper rifles, threatened violence.

According to the Las Vegas Journal-Review, the Senate Majority Leader said: 'They’re nothing more than domestic terrorists. I repeat: what happened there was domestic terrorism.'

'Cliven Bundy does not recognize the United States. The United States, he says, is a foreign government. He doesn’t pay his taxes. He doesn’t pay his fees. And he doesn’t follow the law.'

Reid accused the militia supporting Reid of deliberately putting women and children into the firing line so that, in the event of violence, they got hurt first ensuring the worst possible headlines.

Meanwhile Mr Bundy has warned that he will never back down down from his fight.

'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.'

He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada.

He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.'

Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of-14 and registered Republican, stopped paying taxes in 1993

Bundy, 67, won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada.

Fears of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call off their operation on Saturday.

Supporters of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at any moment.

Many of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared to take on the federal agents in a fire fight.

One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down.'

The dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave Desert tortoise.

Officials tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 but were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed, turned up and threatened to open fire

Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years.

The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle.

Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support.

Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy.

It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2m he owes to the Government.

The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region.

The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals.

The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.
