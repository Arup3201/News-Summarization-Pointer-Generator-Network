An Orange County, New York man has been sentenced for a drug-fueled car crash that killed his teenaged passenger in November 2012.

Edward Lier, 21, of Wallkill was sentenced to five to 15 years behind bars for aggravated vehicular homicide of Alana Tadry, 15.

Lier wept as the judge sentenced him at the Orange County Court in Goshen on Monday.

Sentenced: Edward Lier, 21, was given a five to 15 year sentence for aggravated vehicular homicide

He pleaded guilty to the charge in last November 2013 in exchange for a capped sentence.

The crash happened as he was driving with his friend Tadry, her boyfriend Christopher Giammarino, then 19 and Nicholle Galgan, then 18 on Route 32 in in Newburgh.

According to the Record Online, Lier had smoked marijuana and taken prescription benzodiazepines alprazolam and clonazepam before getting behind the wheel.

Lier's car crossed over into oncoming traffic, hitting a car driven by John Dyer, then 49. He had apparently been overtaking other vehicles and attempted to get back into the southbound lane when his car was struck by Dyer's.

The front of his Audi slid about 200 feet south, according to Long Island Newsday. The rear, where Tadry was sitting, went about 30 feet into the woods. Tadry was killed after she was ejected from the car.

Dyer, Galgan and Giammarino both suffered serious injuries in the smash.

Scarred: Edward Lier made an emotional apology to the Tadry family for the loss of their daughter

'It's not... it's not... I feel awful. We lost our daughter. We're never going to have her back,' Alana Tadry's father Michael Tadry told Record Online, adding that he feels for Edward Lier's parents.

Friends and family of Alana Tadry have established the Alana Tadry Memorial Creative Scholarship in her memory.

The program's mission is to assist students whose academic records may not be perfect but who demonstrate a strong drive to succeed in the creative arts.
