The mother of Stephen Lawrence has said 20 years of scandals since the teenager's racist murder has left her with ‘no confidence’ in police.

Doreen Lawrence said she does not ‘know what to believe any more’ after allegations emerged that senior officers tried to smear her family.

She said only a full public inquiry can get to the bottom of the activities of undercover officers in the months after her son’s killing.

No confidence in officers: Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, appearing before the Home Affairs Select Committee in the wake of claims police tried to smear her family

One former Met undercover officer provoked outrage last month when he claimed commanders wanted ‘dirt’ on the Lawrence family.

Speaking to MPs: Mrs Lawrence arrives at the select committee hearing at Portcullis House in central London

Speaking to the Home Affairs Committee, Mrs Lawrence said she remains deeply shocked at the latest damaging allegations.

Asked if she has confidence in 
police, she replied: ‘I have no confidence whatsoever. Over the years I 
was beginning to develop a level of trust.

‘Because of the investigation, the 
court case and then we had the convictions of two suspects. I was 
beginning to develop some confidence.

‘Now I just don’t know what to believe anymore.’

Two investigations are now examining 
claims undercover officers infiltrated protest groups that gathered 
around the Lawrence family.

Former officer Peter Francis claimed 
attempts were made to discover information that could smear Stephen’s 
family after his racist murder in April 1993.

One inquiry is being led by top QC 
Mark Ellison, who led the successful prosecution of Gary Dobson and 
David Norris in January last year.

The Home Secretary instructed the barrister to examine whether police corruption undermined the original inquiry.

A second investigation, Operation 
Herne, is probing the conduct of police spies generally, with an urgent 
emphasis on the Lawrence family claims.

Mrs Lawrence told MPs that she felt let down by police and the independent police watchdog and wanted a public inquiry.

Hearing: Mrs Lawrence said yesterday that it was not right for 'police officers to investigate each other'

She said Met Commissioner Sir Bernard
Hogan-Howe has said ‘all the right words’ to her but said she is 
waiting to see it ‘come to fruition’.

Death: Stephen was 18 when he was attacked by five white youths as he waited for a bus in Eltham, south-east London, on April 22, 1993

Speaking about the inquiries, she 
said an ‘open and transparent’ public inquiry must take place instead of
reviews ‘behind closed doors’.

She said: ‘You can’t have police officers investigating each other. It’s proven that’s not the right way to do things.’

Mrs Lawrence said she believed her 
family was targeted by police because many officers had not met a black 
family which was not made up of criminals before.

She said: ‘At the time it was probably because we were too outspoken and we were questioning how the investigation was run.

‘We were told on a couple of occasions that they had never met any family like us before.’

Mr Ellison defended the apparently slow progress of his review which has already cost taxpayers £190,000 in just seven months.

His team has more than 100 crates of material to examine, and he said they are about half-way through the task.

The QC said he will refer his 
findings to police if he uncovers evidence of criminal conduct and he 
hopes to release an ‘interim’ report by Christmas.

Repeatedly asked whether a public 
inquiry should take place, Mr Ellison said there is ‘strong validity’ 
for one but also several drawbacks.

He said a public inquiry would be 
slow and cumbersome and witnesses may have to be offered immunity from 
prosecution if they give evidence.
