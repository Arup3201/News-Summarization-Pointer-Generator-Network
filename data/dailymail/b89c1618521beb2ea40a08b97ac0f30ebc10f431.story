Ed Miliband has shelved his pledge to take on Labour’s union paymasters over fears that they could cut off the party’s cash supply in the run-up to the election.

The Labour leader infuriated union bosses in the summer by vowing to weaken the historic links between Labour and the trade union movement.

But last night it emerged that the reforms will be delayed for at least five years, pushing them well beyond the next election in 2015.

Shelved: Ed Miliband has shelved his vow to tackle union paymasters until 2018 because he fears they could cut off the party's funding

The Tories seized on the move as evidence that Mr Miliband remains in hock to the unions, who have supplied 80 per cent of the party’s donations since he took over as leader.

Mr Miliband ordered a review of Labour’s links to the unions following devastating allegations that the Unite union tried to rig the selection of a candidate in the safe Labour seat of Falkirk.

He proposed ending the controversial system in which many union members are automatically signed up as party ‘affiliates’, with part of their annual subscriptions diverted to Labour.

He prefers an opt-in system, despite warnings it would lead to a huge drop in the value of affiliation fees from the unions.

At the time, his aides said the reforms would be brought in before the next election. But Labour sources last night said a five-year implementation plan had always been ‘mentioned as a possible time scale’. Former Labour general secretary Ray Collins has been appointed to draw up reform proposals in time for a special conference next spring.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps accused Mr Miliband of ‘buckling under pressure from his union paymasters’ including Unite leader Len McCluskey, adding: ‘Once again Ed Miliband has shown he’s too weak to stand up to the union barons fixing his own party’s selections. And if he’s too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey, Ed Miliband’s too weak to stand up for hard-working people.’

But the decision to kick the reforms into the long grass also led to soul-searching within Labour.Mark Ferguson, editor of the influential website Labourlist, said a climbdown was ‘inevitable’ given the scale of the union opposition.

He added: ‘What’s worrying is that so far no real sense of a preferred and genuinely workable solution seems to be emerging. The question is, “Has the (Labour) review actually made any progress yet?”. Nothing concrete seems to have emerged – it certainly didn’t at conference. All we’ve got are old, vague plans that look like a fudge being rehashed.’

Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges said the reforms were shelved as a direct result of the party’s financial dependence on the big unions.

‘From the moment Labour’s leader 
announced his decision to end the current affiliation relationship with 
the unions, everyone from the shadow cabinet to back bench Labour MPs to
constituency chairs has been asking the same question – “Where is the 
cash going to come from to keep the party running and fight an election 
in 2015?”'

‘The answer is, “Nowhere”. Labour’s anti-business rhetoric is terrifying potential private-sector donors.  State funding is a political non-starter. That’s the main reason Miliband is preparing to kick his reforms into the long grass. He literally can’t afford not to. Either the unions continue to fund the Labour Party, or there is no Labour Party.’

Labour is considering getting unions to adopt the system used by Unison to affiliate members to the party. Unison asks those who join whether they want to contribute to the union’s Labour fund or its fund for general political campaigns. About 435,000 members of its 1.3million members join the Labour fund.

Unison said the system showed affiliation to Labour would not necessarily collapse if the union movement switched to an opt-in system.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘No one should doubt the radical nature of these reforms. We are moving from trade union levy-payers being automatically affiliated, to those individuals instead able to make an active choice on whether to be part of the Labour Party.’
