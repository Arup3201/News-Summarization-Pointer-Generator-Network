A grandfather who was shot in the head with a suspected rubber bullet said he could have died or been blinded.

John Vernon Thomas was on his first trip abroad to see Everton play in Lille in France when he was shot.

Police are now trying to determine whether a 'flash-ball' or rubber bullet was fired. The bullets are designed to be less lethal than those used in normal guns and were used by officers that day to try and control the trouble which flared between fans. 

The 66-year-old, known as Vernon, said he heard a 'crack' and was hit in the head when he accidentally got caught up in the disturbance in the main square.

John Vernon Thomas was hit in the head by a suspected rubber bullet during the clashes in Lille, France 

Police with shields dispersed Everton fans from Lille square using tear gas canisters as flares were released

He said: 'It hit me right on the temple. I went down in a bit of a shock. Another two inches it would have gone to my eyes. I am lucky to be here. It was a nasty attack. It took the wind out of me.' 

Mr Thomas was taken to hospital and kept in overnight after being told his injuries were life threatening.

He added: 'There was blood pouring out. I don't know if it was a rubber bullet or what. It was like being punched by Mike Tyson. People have said that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

Mr Thomas, a season ticket holder, was forced to miss the match the next day. 

Mr Thomas said had the suspected rubber bullet hit him nearer to his eye he could have been killed or blinded

Clashes broke out in the main square in Lille last Thursday ahead of the game and led to Everton fans being dispersed with tear gas.

Flares were set off and riot police moved through a group of fans, with shields covering their bodies, and released tear gas bombs. 

Rubber bullets are also thought to have been used. 

Fans were left rubbing their eyes and sneezing, and they attempted to flee the scene as bottles flew across the square. Around 7,000 fans had travelled from the UK to Lille for the match.

Police have insisted the 44m rubber bullets, as well as tear gas canisters, had been used by riot police in 'self-defence' after bottles were thrown at them.

The incident was apparently triggered after plain-clothes police tried to arrest a suspected football hooligan. 

The man had been previously spotted by a Merseyside Police officer travelling with Blues (Everton) fans.

He was later released by French police and allowed to return home without charge.

At the same time a French football hooligan who was among thugs who stormed a bar where Everton fans were drinking was jailed.

Blues fans came under attack from up to 100 people the night before the match took place. 

The incident came the day after several Everton fans were injured after an ambush by a group of 50 people, wearing masks and wielding metal chairs outside a pub on Wednesday evening. Two fans suffered minor injuries.

A suspected Lille 'ultra' - known only as Tomasz S - was arrested on Thursday after being recognised by police. The 30-year-old appeared in court on Friday and was jailed for eight months.
