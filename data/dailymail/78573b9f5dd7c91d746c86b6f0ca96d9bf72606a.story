The reward for information leading about the murder of a 19-year-old New Jersey prep school graduate has been increased to $25,000 after police released surveillance footage showing two possible suspects.

Detectives in Essex County, New Jersey, appear no closer to making an arrest in the murder last Wednesday night of Brendan Tevlin, a graduate of the elite Seton Hall Prep school, who was home from college for the summer and had been hanging out with friends.

The Essex County Prosecutor's Office said shortly after the attack that the killing was 'targeted.' However spokeswoman Katherine Carter would not say what evidence led detectives to conclude that Tevlin was not killed at random.

On Monday, an anonymous donor added a $15,000 reward to the $10,000 that was being offered by the sheriff's department, Ms Carter told MailOnline.

Police 
released surveillance photos on Sunday showing two potential suspects 
racing down Walker Road and Northfield Avenue in West Orange, New Jersey
 around the same time that 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin was gunned down.

Tevlin's 
body was found riddled with bullets in the seat of his parents' Jeep 
Liberty in the parking lot of Ron Jolyn Apartments, about a mile from where he was shot.

'At this juncture of the investigation it does not appear to be random,' Anthony Ambrose, the chief of 
detectives for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, told The Star-Ledger.

Before his death, Tevlin had been at a friend's house playing video games and texted his mother about 11.30pm to say he was coming home.

News of the targeted shooting has devastated Tevlin's family and friends, who described him as popular and well-liked.

The teen had finished his freshman year at the University of Richmond, where he was planning to major in business, the school said. He graduated last year from Seton Hall Preparatory School.

Matt Cannizzo, the director of admissions at Seton Hall, told MailOnline students and faculty are ‘stunned’ by the death.

‘He was never in any trouble. Nobody had a problem with him ever. He was a model citizen,’ Cannizzo told MailOnline.

Tevlin’s
 family is heavily involved in the school, where his uncle Patrick 
Tevlin is a former administrator and started the lacrosse program. 

On Thursday night, when news of Tevlin’s death broke, the school organized a mass and memorial attended by more than 300 people.

‘He came from an all-American family and was just a great kid,’ Cannizzo said.

'People need to know what kind of person he was,' said Christian Breslin, who played on the lacrosse team with Tevlin at Seton Hall.

'This kid,
 there was nothing bad about him. He was one of the nicest people I’ve 
ever known.'

The prep school's head, Monsignor Michael Kelly, said the entire school was grieving.

'Brendan was a wonderful young man, friend of everyone, liked by 
all,' he wrote in a news release.

'Our community is praying for the 
family and his grandparents, who were very close to Brendan and to Seton
 Hall Prep.'

During his four years at the school he also volunteered for Knights of Setonia, a community service group.

Ed Ayers, school president of the University of Richmond, said he had planned a business major and was active in sports.

Dozens expressed their grief on Twitter after hearing the news.

'You were a great friend and brother to many,' wrote one user.

Another wrote: 'Brendan Tevlin was everything that was right in this world, and the 
monster that took his life is everything that’s wrong with it. RIP.'
