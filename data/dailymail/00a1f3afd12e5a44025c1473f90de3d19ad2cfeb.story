The President of the Business Council of Australia, Catherine Livingstone, said some students are better off with a trade

School leavers should consider going into trades rather than university as a deregulated fee system threatens to almost double the cost of a degree.Â 

That's the view of Business Council of Australia President Catherine Livingstone, who said there are 'too many people' already enrolled in universities in Australia and more should learn skills for the workforce.

Universities will set their own fees from 2016, making tertiary education unaffordable for some.

Prof Livingstone said the introduction of deregulated system could see more people undertake vocational education training as they weigh up the benefits and costs of various types of education.

'I would say there are too many people going to university and not enough going through the VET system,' Ms Livingstone told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'I just think some students would be better off with vocation and skill training and having work experience.'

Vocational Education Trade providers such as TAFE could offer substantial benefits to some school leavers

Her comments, made before a Group of Eight universities meeting at the National Press Club last week, come after education experts predicted back in June that the Federal Government's changes to higher education could force the cost of degrees to increase to more than $120,000.

The high cost of education could deter people from furthering their studies at university and some have predicted loan repayments will almost double from $6.6 billion this year to $12 billion in 2018.

The Treasury Department has modeled its own dire forecast for tertiary graduates, claiming that 65,000 people, or 30 per cent of graduates, will be without a job four months after finishing their studies in 2016.

Group of Eight universities chairman Ian Young told the National Press Club last that many elite universities, such as his own Australian National University, would probably enrol fewer students under a deregulated fee system.

The University of NSW could be one of Australia's  leading institutions which set their own fees from 2016

He added that a decline in enrolments would allow them more personalised learning experience for students at research universities, and would free-up positions for high-achieving students and academics to attend regional and suburban universities.

Australia's leading research universities typically enrol up to two thirds the number of US universities, because under a capped fee system universities need student numbers to subsidise research programs.

Institutions such as ANU, Sydney and Melbourne, can enrol up to 50,000 students whereas Standford, in the US, enrol just 15,000.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne has justified fee deregulation by pointing out there will still be benefits to having a degree.

He said graduates will be earning about 75 per cent more than non-graduates - or about $1 million more over their lifetimes, but Greens higher education spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon disagrees.

She said: 'It beggars belief the government would introduce these changes when their own department's figures show fewer graduates will be employed.'
