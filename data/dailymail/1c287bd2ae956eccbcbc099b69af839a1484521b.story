A Walmart stock clerk who was fired for violating company policy after helping a woman who was being assaulted in the parking lot has been offered his job back.

The retail giant reversed course after public outcry over Kristopher Oswald's termination from the Walmart in Hartland, Michigan, over the weekend.

Mr Oswald says he was just doing the right thing when he stepped in to help the young woman, who was being harassed and manhandled by her boyfriend. The furious boyfriend punched Mr Oswald in the head six times and his two friends then beat him up.

Jobless: Kristopher Oswald says he never thought he'd be fired for coming to the aid of a woman in distress

When he returned to work the next day, his boss handed him a pink slip.

'We looked into the situation, reviewed the facts, talked to witnesses,' Walmart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said Friday.

'While
Mr Oswald broke a policy of ours - a policy put in place to protect our
associates and our customers ... we realize Mr Oswald's intentions were
good.'

The company said it has called Mr Oswald and told him he can come back to work for Walmart.

Mr Oswald previously said he was not sure he'd want to work for Walmart again if he was offered his old job. He never thought he could be fired for doing the right thing, he said.

'I never expected all of this. And the least I expected was to not have a job,' Mr Oswald told WXYZ-TV.

But Walmart says corporate rules demanded that Mr Oswald not intervene in that circumstance. Mr Oswald's manager wrote he was fired 'after a violation of company policy on his lunch break.'

The assault happened about 2.30am on Sunday in the parking lot while Mr Oswald was on his meal break

'We
had to make a tough decision, one that e don't take lightly, and he's 
no longer with the company,' company spokeswoman Ashley Hardie told the 
Associated Press.

Mr Oswald 
said he was in his car on his break from his job stocking shelves about 
2.30am Sunday when he saw a man grabbing a young woman. It appeared that
he was trying to stop her from leaving the parking lot, Mr Oswald said.

He said he asked her 
if she needed help and the man started punching him in the head and 
yelled that he was going to kill him. Mr Oswald said he was able to get 
on top of the man, but then two other men jumped him from behind.

Livingston County sheriff's deputies arrived and halted the fight.

The woman was not seriously hurt.

Police investigated, but could not track down the suspect.

Mr Oswald had worked for Walmart for about seven weeks and said he would not have been considered a permanent employee until after his 180-day probation.
