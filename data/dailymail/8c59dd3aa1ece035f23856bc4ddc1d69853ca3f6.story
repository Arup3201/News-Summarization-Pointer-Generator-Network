Tragic end: Ronald Wagenhoffer, 50, the Department of Licenses and Inspections employee who surveyed a Philadelphia building before it collapsed last week, has committed suicide

An inspector who surveyed a Philadelphia building before it collapsed last week, killing six people, has committed suicide.

Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison says the inspector was found fatally shot in a pickup truck Wednesday night. The man was a Department of Licenses and Inspections employee who had inspected the building May 14.

Philly.com reported Thursday that detectives have identified the suicide victim as 52-year-old Ronald Wagenhoffer.

According to police, Wagenhoffer was 
found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest inside his 
vehicle parked in the 100 block of Shawmont Avenue at around 9.30pm.

NBC 10 Philadelphia reported that Wagenhoffer left no suicide note, but he allegedly sent his wife a text message before pulling the trigger.

The building was being demolished when
it collapsed onto a neighboring Salvation Army Thrift Store on June 5, 
killing two employees and four customers. Police allege a heavy 
equipment operator was high on marijuana when it happened.

The city's top prosecutor is convening a grand jury to look into the collapse.

Final words: Wagenhoffer allegedly sent his wife a text message before shooting himself in the chest

'With the building collapse a week ago, we have now lost seven lives in connection with this tragedy,' Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison said at a news conference, adding that Wagenhoffer leaves behind a wife and son.

He added: 'This man did nothing wrong. The department did what it was supposed to do.'

Department employees were informed of the death Thursday morning. Wagenhoffer was a 16-year city employee who had started with the Department of Public Property and worked his way up through the ranks to building inspector, according to city officials. He had worked until 3pm. Wednesday.

The department’s head, Carlton Williams, said Wagenhoffer did everything he could to protect people.

'We strive to protect our citizens by enforcing the building codes. And that’s what Ron did,' Williams said. 'He was a dedicated civil servant who loved his job.'

Speaking of Wagenhoffer's behavior after the collapse, Gillison said that 'everybody knew he had taken it hard,' but the 16-year department veteran continued working without even taking a leave of absence. 

A demolition permit indicates that 
contractor Griffin Campbell was being paid $10,000 for the job. 
Campbell's lawyer has called him despondent but 'absolutely not 
responsible' for the deaths. On Thursday, he released a statement 
expressing condolences to the inspector and the families.

'Our
heartfelt condolences go to the family of the inspector,' attorney 
Kenneth Edelin said in a statement. 'We also continue to pray for the 
families of those that were lost, and for the health and speedy recovery
of those that were injured.'

Wasteland: A four-story building being demolished collapsed Wednesday on the edge of downtown, killing six and injuring 13 people

Cleanup: A firefighter sprays the debris on Market Street in Philadelphia, which is all that was left from a building

Records show that Wagenhoffer inspected the building at 2136 Market Street in February and issued a demolition permit for that site as well as for the adjacent building.

The 52-year-old inspector returned to the site on May 14 after receiving a citizen complaint about unsafe demolition practices. Wagenhoffer, however, found no violations.

Six people were killed when a 
building being demolished collapsed and nearly obliterated an adjacent 
Salvation Army thrift store, among the dead a woman who only recently 
got engaged, a young art student and a mother of nine.

The
mayor's office identified the victims as Anne Bryan, Roseline Conteh, 
Borbor Davis, Kimberly Finnegan, Juanita Harmin and Mary Simpson.

New beginning: Kimberly Finnegan, 35, just got engaged two weeks ago and was working her first day as a cashier at the downtown store when she was killed

Lives cut short: Borbor Davis, 68,  (left), pictured with his wife, Maggie,  died working at the Salvation Army store; Anne Bryan, 24, a first-year student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, was shopping at the store when the building came down

Loving mothers: Juanita Harmon, 75, a retired secretary, is survived by four grown sons; Roseline Coneth, 52, an immigrant from Sierra Leone who worked as a certified nursing assistant, was a mother of nine

The
13 people pulled alive from the rubble are Susan Randall, Betty Brown, 
Shirley Ball, Linda Bell, Jennifer Reynolds, Nadine White, Margarita 
Agosta, Richard Stasiorowski, Rosemary Kreutzberg, Rodney Geddis, 
Felicia Hill, Daniel Johnson and Myra Plekan.

It
was revealed last week that nearly a month before the deadly collapse 
that ended the lives of six people, the City of Philadelphia had been 
made aware of potentially unsafe demolition practices at the site.

NBC Philadelphia
reported that Center City resident Stephen Field, 49, called the 
municipal hotline on May 6 to express his concerns that the demolitions 
crew dismantling a building at 2134 Market Street used no safety 
equipment and had no protection for pedestrians.

'There was nothing resembling efforts to prevent people walking by from being hit with brick,' he told the station.

Licensing
& inspection data shows contractor Griffin Campbell Construction 
was handing demolition at multiple adjacent properties along the 2100 
block of Market Street, including house number 2136, which came crashing
down on Wednesday.

All three properties were either owned by or have ties to New York-based STB Investments.

Field
said that after some back-and-forth with a city representative, he was 
notified that an inspector visited the site in question and found no 
safety violations.

At a
press conference last Thursday, Philadelphia Department of Licenses 
& Inspections Commissioner Carlton Williams said that 2136 Market 
Street was not inspected because demolition work had not begun at the 
time of Field's complaint.

Under the influence: Sean Benschop, 42, allegedly tested positive for illegal drugs and prescription narcotics two hours after the building collapse

Boss sued: Demolition contractor Griffin Campbell is facing a lawsuit in connection to the collapse of the Philadelphia building

The 49-year, however, insists that he witnessed crews doing demolition work on both sites before he called the helpline.

In a press release last week, 
Williams said that the city will now begin conducting 'proactive 
inspections' of all private demolitions.

Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter pledged a 'wide-ranging' investigation into the collapse.

John
Dougherty, head of Local 98 of the electrical workers' union, called 
the deadly collapse a 'sad metaphor' for the city's construction 
process, adding that his group had been concerned in recent years with 
similar demolition sites.

Last Saturday, Sean Benschop, the
crane operator accused of being high on marijuana and painkillers when 
the the Market Street building collapsed, turned himself in to police.

Benschop was wanted on six counts of 
involuntary manslaughter, 13 counts of recklessly endangering another 
person and one count of risking a catastrophe.

Authorities
believe the 42-year-old had been using an excavator on Wednesday when 
the remains of the four-story building gave way, killing two employees 
and four customers at the thrift store.

Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison told 
The Associated Press a toxicology report showed evidence that Mr 
Benschop was high on marijuana.

That
finding, combined with witness statements and evidence led to the 
decision on Friday to raid his north Philadelphia home, he said.

Mr Benschop had samples of his 
blood and urine tested at a hospital about two hours after part of the 
building on Market Street crumbled on to the Salvation Army thrift store 
below on Wednesday morning.'

Philadelphia Department of Licenses & Inspections Commissioner Carlton Williams said that 2136 Market Street was not inspected last month because demolition work had not begun at the time

Dramatic moment: A dust cloud rises as people run from the scene of a building collapse on the edge of downtown Philadelphia, which killed six people

At least two survivors have sued the demolition contractor and building owner, alleging gross recklessness at the job site.

The city has since promised to improve the demolition industry.

'We can do much better,' Mayor Michael Nutter said. 'We will not accept the status quo in the face of this tragedy.

Mr Nutter's reform for construction sites includes random drug testing on heavy equipment operators.

The
mayor also pledged to adopt tougher background requirements for 
demolition contractors, including information about each worker's 
experience, and frequent site inspections.

His plan could run into resistance from builders who say they are already highly regulated.
