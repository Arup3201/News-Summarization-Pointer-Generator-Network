A great-grandfather has been left terrified after being forced to fight off a half-naked intruder who  broke into his house and tried to get into bed with him.

Peter Than, 76, armed himself with his walking stick after the suspect broke into his home wearing nothing but a pair of shorts and one sock on Sunday morning.

After unlawfully entering the pensioner's property in Plymouth, Devon, the suspect then went into his bedroom, pulled back the bed sheets and tried to lie down next to him. 

Peter Than, 76, fought off the intruder with his walking stick after the suspect broke into his home in Plymouth, Devon, on Sunday and tried to climb into his bed next to him wearing nothing but a pair of shorts and one sock

Mr Than was awoken in the commotion and bundled the stranger out of bed before fighting him off with his walking stick.

The thug responded by clubbing the pensioner over the head with a rock used as a doorstop but Mr Than man was able to fend him off.

Eventually, the suspect fled the flat and Mr Than - a former mining engineer - was left covered in blood from a head wound.

He said: 'I pushed him out of the bed and he fell off, then I tried to push him out of the flat door.

Mr Than, a former mining engineer, suffered cuts and bruises to his face and head after the suspect clobbered him with a rock as he made his getaway

'I was worried as I have a bit of a heart problem. I've never punched anybody, even as a schoolboy, but I did hit him with my walking stick.

'He threw a few punches but then he picked up a rock I use as a door stop.

'I was able to push him through the front door and pushed it shut but he managed to open it and came back in to give me a bit more bashing.

'Eventually I got him to the door and he ran.'

After fighting the intruder off, Mr Than staggered to a neighbour's flat who called for paramedics and police.

He added: 'I had blood all over me, dripping onto the floor. I thought I was going to die.

'I felt nothing but the blood on my head and face.

'The hospital staff patched me up very well with stitches and glue to close the wounds.

'They did a marvellous job. I worry that I'm never going to see my own face again as I have lot of scars.'

Neighbours watched the suspect flee the scene in what they described to police as 'jockey shorts and a T-shirt.'

Officers believe the stranger was drunk but they have no idea why he tried to climb into the pensioner's bed.

Devon and Cornwall Police said the suspect was described as white, in his 30s, around 6ft tall and of medium build.

He wore a pair of black and white chequered knee-length shorts, a grey top, just one sock and no shoes.

Detective Constable Christian Ferris said: 'This was a violent assault on an elderly man in his own home.

The unusual incident occurred at Mr Than's flat in Albert Road, Plymouth, Devon, at about 7am on Sunday

'Mr Than has been left with facial injuries and a wound to his chest. He had lost a lot of blood before he got to hospital.

'The suspect is unknown to Mr Than and it appears from descriptions he may have been under the influence of alcohol.

'We want to hear from anyone who was in the area or has information about this incident.' 

Anyone with information should contact Devon and Cornwall Police on 101.
