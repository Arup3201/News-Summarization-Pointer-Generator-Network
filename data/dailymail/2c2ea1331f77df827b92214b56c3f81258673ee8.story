England international Zak Hardaker has been dropped by Leeds after it emerged that he is at the centre of a police investigation.

The 23-year-old Leeds full-back and his Rhinos team-mate Elliot Minchella are expected to be interviewed by police in the next few days over the alleged assault of a 22-year-old man in student flats in Leeds.

In a statement Leeds said: 'The club have been made aware of an incident in which it is alleged that Leeds Rhinos players Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved.

'Both the club and the individuals concerned are co-operating fully with the police investigation.

'Until such time as that investigation is concluded neither the club nor the players involved are able to make any further comment.'

West Yorkshire police released images of two men earlier this week in connection to a break-in and assault at premises on Burley Road in Leeds on February 3 but since removed them after receiving fresh information.

A police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we will be speaking to two men in connection with the incident.'

Police say the victim suffered two black eyes and bruising to his ears and neck.

In Hardaker's absence, Leeds coach Brian McDermott gave a full debut to teenager Ashton Golding at full-back for the match against the Wolves.

Golding, who was given a new four-year contract in December that ties him to the club until the end of the 2018 season, made his Super League debut last season at London Broncos.
