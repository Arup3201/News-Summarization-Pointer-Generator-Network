An experimental drug given to a seriously ill Virginia boy after his parents' high-profile plea to a drugs company is starting to take effect.

Just last week seven-year-old Josh Hardy was fighting for his life after contracting a virus that was causing internal bleeding, and heart and kidney failure.

But, after just three doses of Brincidofovir, which is not yet available on the market, Josh is starting to make progress and the virus is leaving his body.

On the mend: The virus attacking Josh's body has nearly gone after just three doses of the new drug

Relief: Josh's family posted this picture of him getting his first dose of the experimental drug

As well as the levels of adenovirus falling, the bleeding in the cancer survivor's stomach and intestines has stopped.

It is a long way from where he was a week ago, when the seven-year-old could barely speak and was vomiting blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside in a Memphis hospital.

Campaign: Chimerix chief executive Kevin Moch agreed to make the drug available after a campaign

His mother, Aimee, who campaigned to get drug company Chimerix to give her son their new drug, said: 'I'm beside myself with how effective this drug was so quickly.'

she told CNN they expect the virus to have left his system by Tuesday.

Josh's body, weakened by chemotherapy after he had cancer for the fourth time, was struggling to fight of the adenovirus.

The only available drugs were not working and Chimerix has refused to give the family access to experimental medication Brincidofovir.

But, after his family launched a high-profile media campaign, Chimerix relented. The company, in return, has been allowed to use data from Josh to help its FDA application, which could bring the drug on the market earlier.

Chimerix
 chief Kenneth Moch announced on Tuesday last week that his firm will begin a
 pilot trial for the drug immediately - with Josh as the program's 
first patient.

Moch had faced huge criticism for denying the 
Fredericksburg boy Brincidofovir to fight off an 
infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant.

In a statement, Moch said that after much careful consideration Chimerix would offer Josh the medicine.

'This
 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop 
innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for 
everyone,' Moch said according to Fox News.

'Being
 unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and 
not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make.

'It
 is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with 
equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further 
clinical study of Brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus 
and other serious DNA viral infections.'

Survivor: Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant

Frail: Before getting the drug Josh was in intensive care, with his heart and kidneys failing

Although physically Josh's condition has improved, his mom says he appears to have lost his motivation after months of ill health.

She told CNN his once-positive attitude appears to have gone and he appears exhausted. 'I haven't seen him smile lately,' she said.

And, although the virus appears to be going, Josh has suffered severe kidney damage after being given other drugs to try to halt the virus.

He has to have dialysis three times a week and could need it for the rest of his life - something that haunts Mrs Hardy. 

'If he could have gotten the Brincidofovir earlier, it could have been avoided. That will always bother me,' she said.

The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but has previously been administered to hundreds of other patients under a prior 'compassionate use' allowance.

Hope: Josh's family say the virus that was killing him could be gone by next week

Previously Moch said that saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to many more patients, draining the company's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given FDA approval and help many more future patients.

However, the company received $72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir.

Before she was able to secure the drug for her son, Mrs Hardy said the situation was devastating, especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live.

'There’s no good excuse for us,' she said. 'There’s nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking. We’re begging them to give it to us.'

Josh's doctors also contacted Chimerex requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug.

Josh was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007. Since then, he has battled the disease four times.

He had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in November of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments.

In January of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

Following the successful surgery he developed adenovirus, an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems.

'Normally, Josh’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,' Mrs Hardy wrote on her son’s CaringBridge page.

'The challenge is his immune system can’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.'

Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, reports Fox and Friends.
