The Duchess of York has been criticised for linking a top university to a controversial diet plan which she is endorsing on American television.

Prince Andrew's ex-wife claims to have lost 4st thanks to a £65 blender which turns fruit and vegetables into smoothies and soup.

In an interview promoting the product on morning TV, she said that she had been motivated to help beat obesity by her work with Imperial College London, one of the world's most prestigious scientific institutions.

Controversy: The Duchess of York is endorsing the Fusion Xcelerator, a blender and diet plan

But the university has been quick to distance itself from the duchess' claims - saying that her commercial projects 'are not connected in any way' to its research, The Times reported.

Experts said they were sceptical about the benefits of her diet plan, casting doubt on the nutritional benefits claimed to come from using the 'emulsifier' which she has promoted in a half-hour 'infomercial' as well as multiple TV interviews.

The duchess, known in the US by her maiden name as Sarah Ferguson, has been outspoken about her battle with her weight since divorcing her husband in 1996 and is said to have been paid £1.4million a year as the face of Weight Watchers.

Last year, she was named as an ambassador for Imperial's Institute of Global Health Innovation, a well-respected research centre headed by renowned surgeon and former health minister Lord Darzi.

Her latest commercial endorsement, as part of a project named 'Duchess Discoveries', is the Fusion Xcelerator, a blender costing $100 (£65) which comes with a diet plan and fitness DVD.

Earlier this week she appeared on NBC's Today show, giving an interview in which she linked the device to her unpaid work with Imperial.

She told host Matt Lauer: 'I have just found out on my discoveries with Imperial College London... I'm an ambassador for the Institute for Global Health Innovation, and I found out that children, little children, are going to die before their parents because of obesity.'

The duchess called the emulsifier 'a solution for behavioural change' as she claimed to have lost 55lbs by using the blender to liquify her food.

Imperial warned that its scientists did not endorse the Xcelerator and cautioned against the use of the university's name in connection with the product.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'Sarah Ferguson holds an unpaid role as an ambassador for Imperial's Institute of Global Health Innovation. The role is to raise the profile of the Institute and its impact.

'The commercial activities promoted by Sarah Ferguson in the interview with Today are not connected in any way to Imperial's staff or research activities, and the College does not endorse the suggestion of any possible link.'

The duchess' spokesman told The Times: 'She is not trying to use her association with the institute to promote her personal interests. She was talking about "behavioural change", which is endorsed by the institute, and her own behavioural change.'

Imperial College London, which was founded in 1907 and specialises in science, technology and medicine, is considered to be one of the best universities in the world.

A global league table recently ranked the institution second overall, joint with Cambridge and behind only the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The university has its headquarters in South Kensington, west London, around the corner from the Natural History Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum.

Imperial teaches 13,400 undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as hosting thousands of top research scientists and professors.

Its staff and alumni have won 15 Nobel Prizes - they include eminent scientists such as Peter Higgs, who discovered the Higgs boson, and Alexander Fleming.

Other former students of the university found fame outside academia, such as sci-fi novelist H.G Wells and Queen's guitarist Brian May.

An advert on the duchess' website claims that the Xcelerator has a 'powerful micro-emulsification system' and can 'break down whole fruits and vegetables into a micro-cellular pre-digestive state'.

But scientists suggested that it was no different to any other blender and warned that a mixture of healthy eating and exercise remains the best way to avoid excessive weight gain.

'In terms of the particular product, no juicer or blender on their own can enhance how much nutrition your body will absorb,' Ayela Spiro of the British Nutrition Foundation told The Times.

'Any claims made about such products such that it accelerates weight loss, boosts energy and strengthens the immune system need to be treated with caution.'

The interview in which the Duchess of York made her controversial comments previously made headlines after she used it to defend her ex-husband Andrew against claims he had sex with an underage girl supplied to him by a convicted paedophile. 

Other commercial products believed to be forthcoming from the Duchess of York include a range of kitchen utensils and specialist tea.
