Kids these days — they don't watch TV like they used to.

That's at least according to one media analyst, who says the American television audience has aged sharply in recent years.

Michael Nathanson, of Moffett Nathanson Research, said in a study released this week that the median age of viewers in the past year was 44.4 years old.

The change represents a significant increase of 6 percent from just four years earlier, the Washington Post reported. 

CBS, with its hugely successful 'NCIS' franchise (pictured), has the oldest television audience, with median ages nearly 59 years old

Fox, whose primetime line-up includes 'Sleepy Hollow' (pictured), has the youngest viewership, about 48 years

That means the average television viewer is aging faster than the American population, at a rate of about 5 percent, Nathanson said.

The increase is even sharper for people watching major broadcast network shows. For that group, the median age is nearly 54 years old, an increase of 7 percent from four years ago, according to the Post.

CBS has the oldest audience, or about 59 years old.  Fox has the youngest, nearly 48 years.

Nathanson points out to a number of reasons for the new trend.

'The shift in demographic viewing is caused by a combination of factors ranging from lower TV penetration rates of under-25 year old households to increasing use of time-shifting technologies in most under-55 year old households,' Nathanson wrote in his research, as reported by the Post.

Some in the younger crowd like having control over when and where they watch programming, causing live viewership to drop 13 percent for all age groups except those 55 years and older.

With those preferences, younger viewers tend to stick to on-demand offerings such as Netflix.

Researchers say younger generations prefer controlling when and where they watch their favorite shows, giving preference to on-demand services like Netflix
