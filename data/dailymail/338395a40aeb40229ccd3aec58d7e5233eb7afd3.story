Wilfried Bony’s agent has revealed 
Newcastle rejected the chance to sign the Swansea City striker for 
£10million last summer – and insisted they will not get a second chance 
this year because they lack ambition.

Newcastle
 are among a clutch of clubs believed to be keen on the Ivorian, who 
scored 25 goals in a stunning first season in south Wales following his 
£12m from Vitesse Arnhem last summer.

But
 Bony’s agent Dalibor Lacina has told Newcastle that only a top-six club
 willing to spend £20m will land the 25-year-old, and criticised Alan 
Pardew for not taking a punt on the striker this time last year after a 
season in which he scored 31 goals in 30 games in Holland. 

No go: Wilfried Bony will not be joining Newcastle United this summer, according to the player's agent

‘They
 could have signed him for £10m, but they said they weren’t sure if he 
was good enough, that he was only playing in Holland,’ Lacina said.

‘I know Wilfried. I brought him over from Africa and I know what he can do. I used to be a player and coach myself.

‘I
 told them that he would score goals wherever he played but it was only 
Huw Jenkins (the Swansea chairman) who took the risk. Now he is worth 
£20m.

‘Newcastle is a 
traditional, fantastic club but they are always the same with transfers.
 I was in contact with them a couple of years ago over Tomas Ujfalusi, 
who played for Atletico and Fiorentina, but it was a similar story.’

Spot on: Bony scored 16 times in his maiden season in English football

He
 added: ‘We have a certain strategy. Bony is in a totally different 
place to Newcastle and wants to move to a club with ambition.

‘We have had no contact with Newcastle.’

Bony
 is an integral part to Garry Monk’s Swansea side, but the striker has 
delivered mixed messages on his future, having reiterated his commitment
 to the club while also spelling out his understandable desire to play 
at a higher level.

Swansea 
have agreed a £6.5m fee for FC Twente striker Luc Castaignos and a move 
is expected to be wrapped up when Jenkins and the player return from 
their respective summer breaks.

His arrival is not seen as a precursor 
to Bony leaving, with Monk keen to enhance his striking options.

Lacina
 added: ‘The next step for Bony is a top-six team in England or a top 
team in Germany, Spain or France, or he will stay with Swansea.’
