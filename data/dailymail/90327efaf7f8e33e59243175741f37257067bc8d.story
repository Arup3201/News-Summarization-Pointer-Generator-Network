The distraught father of a missing college senior whose purse was found on a walkway of the George Washington Bridge has choked back the tears as he pleaded for her to come home.

'Please get a phone,' Christopher Aiello said in a message to his daughter, Paige Aiello, as he grew emotional. 'Call because we need you and want to see you again.'

The devastated father said his youngest daughter had been under a lot of stress at the College of New Jersey, where she was the tennis captain and a top honors student.

She was deciding which law school to attend out of the nine she had been accepted to when she vanished on Tuesday - just two days before her 22nd birthday.

Overachiever: Paige Aiello, a College of New Jersey senior and the captain of the school's tennis team, went missing two days before her 22nd birthday. Her family has said she was under a great deal of pressure

'With her birthday coming and with the fact that she was distraught, [maybe] she just wanted to be missing and not celebrate during this time,' Mr Aiello told NBC. 'I really don't know what to think.'

He added to WPIX: 'She had a work ethic so I hope that hasn't been her downfall.'

Paige Aiello was reported missing on Tuesday by her family in Hillsborough after she apparently took her mother's car without permission, authorities said.

That night, a passer-by reported finding her purse, cell phone and car keys on the south walkway of the George Washington Bridge.

Desperate search: Police scoured the Hudson River under the George Washington Bridge, but failed to find anything to lead them to Aiello's whereabouts

Authorities searched the Hudson River and both levels of the bridge and did not find anything, and surveillance camera images at the bridge are not recorded, WPIX reported.

On Wednesday, authorities found the missing car at a parking garage in New Brunswick, next to the train station. Mr Aiello said it was believed she took the train to New York.

He told WCBS that his daughter, a co-captain of the school tennis team who also worked several jobs, had done ‘incredibly well’ in high school and college and was accepted to nine law schools.

But he added that she was feeling under a great deal of stress and was living at home for added support.

‘She had hit almost like a wall where she felt she was not maybe either worthy of all this or she just couldn't handle it,’ he said.

Under stress: Aiello, a communications major, 
has been working two jobs, struggling with a heavy workload at school 
and preparing to attend law school in the fall. Her family described her as a 'perfectionist'

Top student: Paige's father worried that the fact that it was her 22nd birthday on Thursday may have something to do with her disappearance on Tuesday

He said his message all day had been: ‘Not only do we have to be watching our children that are not doing well and getting in trouble, but we have to see and watch the kids that are the overachievers.

‘They have a self-imposed stress. You don't need a parent to be constantly on their back if their stress is internalized.’

Aiello said he was encouraged that no
 one reported witnessing anyone jumping from the bridge. He said he was 
worried that without a cell phone, she could just be wandering around.

Miss
 Aiello was last seen by her father at around 1pm at home. About two 
hours later, her mother came home and noticed that her car, a 2006 grey 
Audi A4, was gone, along with her daughter.

The
 student was not answering her phone, and shortly before 8pm her father 
reported the woman missing. At some point, the device was apparently 
switched off, according to Paige's sister, Erin.

Unsettling find: Aiello's car keys, purse and cell phone were discovered on the George Washington Bridge

A Good Samaritan came across Miss Aiello's belongings on the south walkway of the upper level of the George Washington Bridge and contacted the woman's parents.

Paige Aiello, a communications major at TCNJ, has been under a lot of pressure lately, working two jobs and preparing to attend Rutgers Law School in the fall, according to her sister.

'She a perfectionist, she's a very driven kid,' Erin Aiello told NJ.com.

After
 experiencing a breakdown recently and buckling under her workload at 
school, Paige temporarily moved out of her on-campus apartment and 
returned home to be with her family.

'I think she bit off more than she could chew this semester,' her sister added.
