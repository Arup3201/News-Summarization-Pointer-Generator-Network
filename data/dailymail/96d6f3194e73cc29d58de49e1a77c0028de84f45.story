Brothels, sex shops and lap dancing clubs have been raided by more than 200 police in a major crackdown on organised crime in central London.

Officers made 29 arrests as part of an undercover operation to root out drugs, prostitution and people trafficking in Soho.

Around a dozen women who were found in 
squalid rooms after apparently being brought into the country for 
prostitution were taken to safe locations for questioning.

During the 18-month investigation, detectives found evidence linking drug 
dealers and stolen goods to a number of properties 
including 22 brothels, three sex shops, two lap dancing clubs and a cab company.

The premises were targeted by officers in riot vans, supported by a police helicopter and sniffer dogs, from 9pm last night.

They seized class A drugs, cash and stolen smartphones.

More
 arrests were made this morning and officers are still searching over 20
 addresses, including the homes of many of the suspects.

Commander Alison Newcomb of Westminster Police told The Evening Standard:
 'Yes, its edginess is why some people come here, but when they do come 
here we want them to be safe, not to be robbed, and enjoy their night 
out.'

People are 146 times more likely to be robbed in Soho than in the rest of the UK.

Cdr Newcomb said: 
'These operations have given us a much clearer intelligence picture and 
evidence of connections between criminals and crime types that were 
happening in Soho, from street drug dealers to links with human 
traffickers.

'This

 the Met so we have used a range of specialist officers, skills and 
policing tactics to make this a hostile area for criminals to try and 
operate in.'

The Metropolitan Police will now apply for closure orders to shut down premises linked to serious crime.

Cdr
 Newcomb said: 'The next step will be to work to close a number of the 
brothels where we have evidence of very serious crimes happening, 
including rape and human trafficking.

'Financial
 investigators will now follow the money trail and will go where the 
evidence takes them, unpicking if there are broader criminal networks 
involved.

'We will continue
 to do all we can to make this a hostile environment for criminals to 
try and operate in. The next phase of this operation is already in the 
planning.'

Decisive action: Police will now apply for closure orders to shut down premises linked to serious crime

Councillor Philippa Roe, Leader of 
Westminster City Council, said: 'The night time economy is a cornerstone
 of the West End's success and, as part of the West End Partnership, 
Westminster City Council works to promote the area as a safe place for 
law abiding people to live and do business.

'Drugs,
 theft, handling stolen goods and human trafficking have no part in that
 which is why Westminster City Council stands shoulder to shoulder with 
the Metropolitan Police Service in Operation Demontere.

'Together,
 we're sending the clear message that the insidious tentacles of the 
criminal underworld will not be allowed to spread through Soho unchecked
 and unchallenged.

'Tonight's raids struck a significant 
blow against the criminal infrastructure. Now, however, we want to be 
just as clear that Westminster City Council is ready to help any 
vulnerable woman - themselves victims of crime, trapped in a way of life
 where they have little or no control. For us, their safety is 
paramount.'

Financial investigators will now follow the money trail to see if there are wider criminal networks involved

Codenamed Demontere, the operation has been months in the planning using evidence gathered by undercover officers and other policing tactics to target those people using various businesses as a front for handling stolen goods.

Previously, operations - codenamed Jolt and Rense - have taken place since May 2012, using a range of policing tactics and specialist officers from across the Met, to tackle the drugs market in Soho.

To date, as part of these operations, 73 drug dealers and users have been arrested, being jailed for over 170 years in total, or have anti-social behaviour orders in place against them.
