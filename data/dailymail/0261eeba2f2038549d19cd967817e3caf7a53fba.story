A soldier beat his two-year-old daughter to death after he became upset that she had soiled her diaper, police have said.

Dartarious Graham, 20, has been charged with capital murder after his daughter Peyton was found unresponsive with 'suspicious' injuries in his apartment in Fort Bliss, Texas.

Police have also charged Graham's cousin Robert Franklin, 19, for allegedly witnessing the attack and walking away.

Charged: US Army specialist Dartarious Graham, 20, has been charged with murder for allegedly beating his two-year-old daughter Peyton to death in his apartment after becoming enraged that she had soiled her diaper

Graham, a US army specialist, is said to have become enraged and taken the little girl into his room with a belt.

According to police, Franklin looked through the door and saw Graham beating little Peyton but 'actually walked away while the beating took place.'

Investigators said Franklin told them he heard the child continue to be attacked and then came out of the bedroom.

The pair called 911 in panic when they noticed the child go limp at 4.50pm on Saturday.   

Peyton was transported to El Paso Children's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead an hour later, ABC7 reported.

Also detained: Graham's cousin Robert Franklin, 19, (left) allegedly witnessed the attacked 'but walked away'. He has been charged with injury by omission. Peyton's mother Elizabeth (right), 23, is facing the same charge

The child's mother, Elizabeth Graham, 23, who was not home at the time of the incident, has been charged with injury to a child by omission.  

Investigators learned the father had a history of beating the child and that the mother had failed to protect her and report the abuse, police said. 

All three are being held in El Paso County jail. 

Dartarious Graham, whose bail is set at $250,000, could face the death penalty or life without parole if convicted.
