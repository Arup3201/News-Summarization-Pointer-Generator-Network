A mother killed her four-day-old son by snorting a powerful pain reliever and then breastfeeding the baby, police have said.

Reanna Pederson, 32, pleaded not guilty to a negligent homicide charge in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday,  three months after the death of her son Avery, the Forum News Service reported.

Pederson, who also has two older children, faces five years in prison if found guilty.

The mother, who also allegedly admitted to using drugs during her pregnancy, is accused of getting high on hydrocodone on June 13 before breastfeeding her newborn at her home in West Fargo.

Accused: Mother-of-three Reanna Pederson, 32, allegedly snorted pain killers before breastfeeding her son and falling asleep. When she woke up 30 minutes later, he was not responsive and later died

She fell asleep while breastfeeding around 11pm and when she woke 30 minutes later, the baby was not responsive.

She called 911 and paramedics performed CPR on Avery before rushing him to hospital. He was on life support for a day but passed away on June 14.

Pederson told police she believed she had accidentally smothered the child, but authorities claim the baby boy suffered fatal effects from the drugs, WDAY reported. 

A witness also told a West Fargo police officer that Pederson had smoked methamphetamine in the days before delivering her child.

Relatives said they believed Pederson was responsible for the death. 

'The West Fargo Police Department called me,' the boy's grandmother Lisa Miller told Valley News Live. 'And I said, "As far as I'm concerned, if anything happens to him, she killed him".'

Loss: Avery was just four days old when he passed away in a Fargo hospital in June. His mother has also allegedly admitted to using drugs throughout her pregnancy with him

She added that if Pederson serves the maximum of five years, that is not justice. 

'If he was here with us, he could live to be 80, 85. What's five years? That's not justice,' Miller said.

'Five years is not near enough time for taking a life and that's exactly what she did. She took a life. She took my grandson's life.'

In Avery's obituary, his relatives wrote: 'We had all looked forward to having our precious Avery as our little brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. Even in his short life he touched our hearts with great love and we will miss him so very much.'

Pederson is out on $5,000 bail. Her two other children are with relatives.
