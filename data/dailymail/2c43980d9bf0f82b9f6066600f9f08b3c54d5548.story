Hillary Clinton's upcoming book Hard Choices contains a detailed chapter on the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Politico has learned.

In the 34-page chapter of the book, which Politico obtained ahead of the book's June 10 release date, the former secretary of state writes that the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, was 'a punch in the gut' and  'a crushing blow' but maintains that she did nothing wrong.

Republicans are doing a disservice to the Americans who died in the attack by continuing to assassinate her character, Clinton suggests.

'Those who exploit this tragedy over and over as a political tool minimize the sacrifice of those who served our country,' she writes.

'I will not be a part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead Americans. It’s just plain wrong, and it’s unworthy of our great country. Those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

A chapter from Hillary Clinton's upcoming book was leaked to press. In it, she defends the Obama administration's response to the terrorist attack in Benghazi on September 11, 2012

In the chapter Clinton rehashes the White House and State Department's response to the turmoil in Benghazi both before and after the terrorist attack.

In one passage Clinton makes the case that the much talked about anti-Muslim video was 'indeed a factor' in the attack on the Benghazi consulate.

'There were scores of attackers that night, almost certainly with differing motives,' she writes. 'It is inaccurate to state that every single one of them was influenced by this hateful video. It is equally inaccurate to state that none of them were. Both assertions defy not only the evidence but logic as well.'

Clinton maintains that what U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice told Americans about the video on news shows was the best information available at the time. Rice simply espoused the talking points created by the CIA for members of Congress, Clinton says, repeating prior claims.

'Susan stated what the intelligence community believed, rightly or wrongly, at the time,' Clinton says. 'That was the best she or anyone could do. Every step of the way, whenever something new was learned, it was quickly shared with Congress and the American people.'

'There is a difference between getting something wrong, and committing wrong. A big difference that some have blurred to the point of casting those who made a mistake as intentionally deceitful,' she continues.

The former secretary of state also sheds light on how Rice ended up on the Sunday morning news shows in the first place.

To political observers, it seemed odd at the time that the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations was designated by the White House to go on the shows instead of a senior or cabinet level official.

Clinton says in the book she didn't do it because it wasn't her job to represent the administration on talk shows.

There are those who 'fixate on the question of why I didn’t go on TV that morning, as if appearing on a talk show is the equivalent of jury duty, where one has to have a compelling reason to get out of it.' Clinton writes, 'I don’t see appearing on Sunday-morning television as any more of a responsibility than appearing on late-night TV.'

'Only in Washington is the definition of talking to Americans confined to 9 A.M. on Sunday mornings.'

Clinton, a more stern and serious politician than she was during her husband's presidency, is positioning herself for a White House run of her own kn 2016

It also wasn't her job to read the cables being transmitted to State from personnel on the ground warning of growing security threats even though they are addressed to her, Clinton notes.

'That’s not how it works. It shouldn’t. And it didn’t.'

Clinton reiterates in the book that her name was only on the diplomatic cables because of a 'procedural quirk,' and that's why she never saw the cables from Stevens leading up to the attack in which he relayed the commander of Benghazi's Supreme Security Council's concerns that police and security forces were not equipped to handle unrest in the area.

Republican groups have made quick work of tearing down Clinton's claims.

'Clinton’s claim not only that she wasn’t aware of security requests, but
 actually shouldn’t have been bothered with them, is nothing short of 
appalling,' America Rising PAC, a Republican opposition research outfit, wrote in a blog post on its website this morning.

'Clinton also seems to be one of the last people who still believe that the attack was fueled by an anti-Islam video.'

In a research briefing 'Fact Checking Hillary Clinton's Benghazi Narrative,' The Republican National Committee points to testimony from former Deputy Chief of Mission Greg Hicks, who was one of  the highest-ranking officials in Libya at the time, that the attack was not the result of a spontaneous protest to to the distasteful YouTube video.

A year ago Hicks told officials from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning.'

The rest of Clinton's memoir will be released next month, but no other chapter is likely to draw as much attention as the one that was leaked today.

The Benghazi section was reportedly being circulated among influential Democrats so they could familiarize themselves with Clinton's claims before next month's release.

Politico's sources also say that  former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor is helping Clinton with the roll out.

Vietor, who no longer works for the Obama administration in any capacity, notably told Fox News earlier this month that he doesn't 'really remember' what changes he did or did not make to Rice's talking points in his capacity as NSC spokesman.

'Dude, this was like two years ago,' he said.

Politico tried to get Clinton's spokesman, Nick Merrill, to provide further insight into Clinton's defense strategy, but he declined to comment on her thinking.

'Until the book is released, there’s nothing to say. And once it’s released, it will speak for itself,' he said.
