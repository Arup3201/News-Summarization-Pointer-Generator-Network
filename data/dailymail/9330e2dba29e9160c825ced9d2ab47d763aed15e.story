If you think a garage is just a place to park a car, once you have looked through these photos, you may be left wondering what is hidden behind every garage door near you.Â 

For years what goes on behind the closed
doors has remained a mystery for most women with 
many people considering it to be a 'man only' zone.

But Helena Day Breese has lifted the lid on this extraordinary space, travelling America to find the most bizarre and fascinating ways in which men use their garage.

Harley heaven: Andy's garage is bigger than his house and he uses it to store his Harley Davidson motorcycles and other Harley paraphernalia, including a Harley pinball machine and Harley jukebox

Crammed with cars: Lynn has a garage filled with 10 Shelby Cobras, Cobra memorabilia and with three hot rods and a dragster

For the love of cars: Bill spends his time sitting in his tiny garage filled with an assortment of car parts for restoring Volkswagen Beetles

Multi-functional space: Bob has a 5,000-square-foot garage where he works on German cars and at weekends uses the space to enjoy his hobby of World War II reenactment

Intriguing challenge: Helena Day Breese scoured America to find the most bizarre and fascinating ways in which men use their garages and even managed to make a book of her findings, photographing 50 garages

Helena Day Breese, who moved to America from South London 25 years ago, left her Californian home in search some extraordinary characters and even managed to make a book of her findings.

Helena snapped the inside of 50 garages and captured a whole host of bizarre collections including a retired plumber turned artist whose garage is filled with more than 800 decorated toilet seats.

She also met a palaeontologist who is erecting a 70-foot-long brontosaurus in his garage and a man who works in his garage, building wooden crosses for each American soldier killed in Iraq.

Helena, who has since published her book called 'Guys and Garages', said the whole experience was very extraordinary.

Pedal power: Larry has collected more than 100 toy pedal cars and proudly displays them on shelves in his sizeable garage

Beyond these four walls: Mark, a former U.S. Navy pilot is using his garage space as a workshop to build his own airplane

Gladiator garage: Moe, who has always been mesmerised by gladiators and medieval knights, poses in the suit of armour that he made in his garage

Back garden bar: Jim, a history buff, has captured the era of the 1940s and 1950s in his garage, including the town soda fountain that he enjoyed as a boy and the gas pumps his father used when he ran a service station in the 1930s

Snapping the snapper: Rob has a garage full of cameras and other gear he uses as a cameraman and cinematographer

She said: 'The idea to do it just sort of dawned on me one day after watching the behaviour of one of my neighbours. One in particular used his garage as a decompression place.

'In the UK there's obviously very much a shed culture and the shed is known to be a place occupied by men.

'But watching my neighbours made me realise there is an equivalent here in America too and that's the garage.

'It's somewhere they can go to pursue projects or just chill out but it seems to be a very necessary space for men.

'I love people and I think people are really what made me excited about the whole project.

'I got to spend time with a wide variety of people and they welcomed me into their space.

'They don't necessarily want to share the space with people all the time but when they find somebody who is interested in what's going on in their garage, they're interested in talking about it.

'I would spend some time with one man and by the end of the shoot he would be saying you've got to see my friend. It was very much a serendipitous process.

'All of the men featured in the book threw their garage doors wide open and basically said come in, let me tell you about it.'
