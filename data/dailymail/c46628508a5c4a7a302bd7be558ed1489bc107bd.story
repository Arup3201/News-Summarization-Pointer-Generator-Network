Capita is using text messages to tell people to leave the UK, but hundreds of people who received them have done nothing wrong

A bungling private contractor hired by the government to kick out illegal immigrants is using text messages to tell people to leave.

Capita’s £30million contract is to be investigated by the data watchdog after bombarding hundreds of people with messages who are in the UK perfectly legally.

Among those wrongly warned they must leave are nurses, British passport holders and several people who are not even in Britain.

Critics warn that people receiving the text messages assume they are spam and delete them.

The standard text message from Capita states: ‘Message from the UK Border Agency: You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain.’

They were sent out over the Christmas holidays. The company also uses phone, email or letter to warn people that UKBA records suggest they need to leave the country.

Today the Information Commissioner launched an investigation into the bizarre tactic, amid complaints that UKBA is holding inaccurate and outdated data, in breach of the Data Protection Act.

Alison Harvey, head of the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, said: ‘In theory, this is a group of people who UKBA records show have no right to be in the UK and should leave.

‘In practice, I have seen British citizens getting these messages, I have seen people who have invested £1 million in the UK getting these messages, I have seen nurses getting these messages.

‘I have even seen people who left a couple of years ago getting these messages. I have spoken to people who have got in touch (with Capita) and then the texts and phone calls have carried on,’ she told the Today programme.

The people being pursued are on a list of 174,000 who the authorities have lost track of - mostly overseas workers and students whose visas are believed to have expired.

Home Secretary Theresa May has promised the Home Office will examine the case.

The UK Border Agency said people wrongly told to leave the UK should ask Capita to update their contact lists

The number of people wrongly contacted could run into hundreds, some of whom were receiving several calls or messages a day.

The Information Commissioner's Office is now investigating ‘what steps UKBA has taken to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act’.

Home Secretary Theresa May has faced calls to investigate the problems

A spokesman said: ‘It's important that organisations make sure they are taking reasonable steps to ensure they comply with the Data Protection Act, including ensuring the personal information they hold is adequate, accurate, and where necessary, kept up to date.’

Julian Hupper, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, challenged Mrs May to investigate the problems.

'Capita has a contract with the UK Border Agency to clear the migration refusal pool and make sure that people leave the country when they are supposed to,' he told the Commons this week.

'However, as the Home Secretary will be aware, people who are allowed to stay have also been contacted and told to leave, including British citizens.

'Is this a problem with Capita or with the UK Border Agency’s continuing problems with its record keeping? What action will she take on the agency?'

Mrs May said ministers would 'look at the processes that have been followed'.

The UK Borders Agency said it was up to people who were wrongly contacted to get Capita to update their records.

A UKBA spokesman said: ‘Out of thousands of people contacted by Capita, a small number have been found to have the right to be in the UK or an outstanding application. Anyone contacted in error has been asked to get in touch with Capita to update their records.

‘We are mindful of the importance of data protection and are in touch with the Information Commissioner's Office.’

A man for Capita later said the company had not been contacted by the ICO.
