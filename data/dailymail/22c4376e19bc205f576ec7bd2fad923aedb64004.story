Stable condition: Wright is reportedly awaiting surgery at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital

Wright's friend, Jessae Goshae, told FOX 31 that Wright was in a stable condition and awaiting surgery at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany.

Wright's aunt, Ann Smalls, said Wright's mother was also injured after being tied up. She has not been identified.

'We are very upset, we are very hurt that such an innocent person can be done like this,' she told WALB NEWS.

A neighbor told WALB NEWS she was watching television when she heard a loud noise at the time of the shooting which sounded like a firecracker.

Fox 31 reported witnesses said Wright was standing outside his house when he was shot. This has not been confirmed.

Authorities said they have not yet named any suspects in the case.

Wright was elected in November when he was 22, making him the youngest mayor in Georgia.

He beat longstanding mayor Robert Albritten.

Fox 31 reported people traveled from across the country to take part in his inauguration ceremony.

'The next step is getting in office, developing a relationship with the personnel in city hall, city managers and elected officials,' Wright said last year.

'We got to get together to get on the same page and work towards a common call and that's achieving goals that have been set on my platform and I stand firm behind that.'

According to his LinkedIn account, Wright was an assistant manager at Johnson & Son Funeral Service and a substitute teacher before taking office.
