Wizard news, Harry Potter fans: JK Rowling has written a new spin-off story for Halloween.

The fans’ website Pottermore hinted it would focus on Harry’s arch-enemy Dolores Umbridge, played by Imelda Staunton in the series’ film adaptations.

The 1,500-word story is due to be posted online next Friday – October 31.

JK Rowling will release a 1,500 word short story on Halloween about Harry Potter's arch-enemy Dolores Umbridge

A spokesman for the author later confirmed it would be ‘filled with many new details’, as well as Miss Rowling’s ‘revealing first-person thoughts and reflections’ of Professor Umbridge, first introduced to readers in her fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

The news comes after Miss Rowling, 49, published a tale on Pottermore earlier this year featuring a grown-up Harry watching a Quidditch match.

Short stories are not the only Potter-related pet projects that Miss Rowling has been working on, however. 

It emerged this month that the wealthy author has submitted plans to build a cottage similar to Hogwarts caretaker Hagrid’s hut at her estate in Perthshire.

Earlier this year the author revealed she would be writing the screenplays for 'at least' a trilogy of Harry Potter spin-off films. 

The writer has not ruled out ever writing another Harry Potter book but revealed she had no plans to do so in the near future. The fictional wizard was portrayed in a film franchise by Daniel Radcliffe (pictured)

The short story is expected to offer more detail into the character of Dolores Umbridge (centre) played by Imelda Staunton 

Based on her 2011 book Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, the films are thought to be planned for release in 2016, 2018 and 2020. 

But while fans speculate about the release of another Harry Potter novel, a statement on the writer's website revealed no such plans were in the works.

‘I have always refused to say "never" to this question, because I think it would be foolish to rule out something I might want to do in a few years’ time. 

'However, I have no immediate plans to write another Harry Potter novel, and I do think that I have rounded off Harry’s story in the seven published books.’
