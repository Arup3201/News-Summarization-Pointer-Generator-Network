The Israeli government released the phone numbers and addresses of every registered dog owner in the country today, including fashion model Bar Refaeli. 

The country's Ministry of Agriculture gave out the information as part of its 'Dogs Database', an app which allows people to search for information on every registered dog in Israel.

As well as Ms Refaeli, the database allegedly included Benny Gantz, the head of the Israeli army, Yohanan Danino, the head of the country's police force and Yair Shamir, the minister of agriculture.

The phone number of model Bar Refaeli was given out on the 'Dogs Database' application 

The TV star had her details shown on the app which allows people to search for every registered dog in Israel

The Israeli government requires all dog owners to register their pets with the Ministry of Agriculture.

A spokesman for the Ministry told Vocativ website: 'The public’s interest to create a reliable, publicly available database outweighs people’s right to privacy.'  .

 The app aims to ensure dogs are properly vaccinated for rabies and other diseases.
