An adventurous photographer, Kent Mearig, couldn't resist scaling a 50-foot deep ice crevasse - simply because it lay within the city limits of his hometown.

With an ice axe in hand, the 33-year-old local resident drove, kayaked and trekked the 10 miles from his home in Alaska's capital, Juneau, to the Mendenhall Glacier, so that he could enjoy the simple thrill of exploring one of nature's most spectacular phenomena.

'The images show a massive moulin, which is a glacial feature that is the result of flowing water carving its way down through weaker points in the ice,' Mearig said.

The glacier is only 10 miles from his home - in Juneau, Alaska - and Mearig has long been exploring the icy natural wonders

''We visited the Mendenhall Glacier because it is unbearably easy to access its incredible features, like the one in the photos, only a couple of hours from our homes.

'There are times, especially when the sun is in the sky, that you just can't justify not going exploring on the ice... and this was one of those times.

'Sometimes the openings point straight down to the bedrock under the glacier, and other times, they turn and run horizontally for awhile.

'That was the case for this particular feature - it contained a passage that curved around a couple bends and was quite long.'

To assist him with his trek, Mearig enlisted the help of Corey Denton (left) and Dawn Riley (right), who are experienced glacier guides 

Home to just 32,000 residents, Juneau was founded in 1881 by American miners who came to the land after Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.

Now, it's a modern city that must contend with nature, like in 2008, when an avalanche damaged the local power supply leaving the city without mains power or when last year's earthquake disrupted telecommunications.

The city of Juneau is adjacent to the Juneau Icefield, so it is surrounded by a glacial landscape that includes islands, fjords, u-shaped valleys, sculpted mountains, and of course the glaciers themselves.

Mearig admits that it's difficult to describe just how much he loves the Mendenhall Glacier, as it's been part of his life since he was 10 years old

Kent visited the most accessible local glacier with experienced local guides Corey Denton and Dawn Riley.

'Corey and Dawn are both glacier guides with extensive training and experience on the Mendenhall,' Mearig explained.

'But there's always a degree of danger inherent in glacier travel and climbing in general.

'It's difficult to describe how much I love the Mendenhall Glacier.

'Views of the glacier have been a part of my daily life since I was ten years old, and I've been enjoying its beauty up close for more than a decade.

'It is constantly changing as it retreats further and further up its valley, but it consistently takes my breath away.'
