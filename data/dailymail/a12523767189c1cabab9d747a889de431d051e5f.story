Supporters watching the NRL All Stars take on the Indigenous All Stars got more than they bargained for when a tackle left one player with his shorts round his ankles.

Indigenous centre Greg Inglis was making a break during the first half of the clash when he, and his shorts, were brought down by an opposition player.

The 28-year-old was wearing 'budgy smuggler' underwear in the pattern of the Koori flag - the official Australian Aboriginal flag.

The underwear, which normally cost 50 Australian dollars (about £25), were only on show for a few moments but it was long enough to cause a few smirks around the ground. 

Fortunately for Inglis, he stood out for more than just his choice of clothing during the match. 

He took a sensational catch early in the second half before evading opposing players and going over between the posts for his side's first try of the game.

And his effort kick-started the Indigenous All Stars' comeback. Will Chambers and Chris Grevsmuhl also scored tries as the underdogs went on to win 20-6.
