For 12 year-old Zara each tentative, nervous, deliberate movement of her feet was a step into the unknown.

Three months ago she had been unable to walk at all and faced a desperate future in Afghanistan with little prospect of help or ever being able to marry and raise a family because she was born with the deformity of bilateral clubbed feet.

But today supported gently and encouraged in each step by British aid worker Kate Rowlands she was able to walk around a rose-lined garden in a suburb of the Afghan capital Kabul before resting on the seat of a swing watched with delight by her mother Latifa.

Inspirational: British aid worker Kate Rowlands

Childrens House, a charity bringing medical treatment to the country's 
poorest youngsters

Legacy: The work of Children's House is being supported by foundations set up in memory of Linda Norgrove, left, 36, who was kidnapped by the Taliban and killed in October 2010 as U.S. Special Forces tried to rescue her, and Dr Karen Woo, right, also 36, who was shot dead months earlier in an attack still shrouded in mystery

‘To us this is a miracle, a gift of 
life…a return to the type of life everyone should be able to live,’ the 
smiling 29 year-old mother-of-five said.

‘We did not think that she 
would ever be able to walk freely like this – and on her own.’

The
words ‘miracle’ and ‘gift of life’ are regularly used by the families 
of some 35 Afghan youngsters receiving treatment at The Children’s 
House, a French-run project in Kabul, that provides surgery, medical 
care and a peaceful sanctuary during recovery for patients and their 
families from all over Afghanistan.

It
is a remarkable and inspirational project which is being backed by 
foundations set-up in the memory of two equally remarkable and 
inspirational British women killed while they tried to help the women 
and children in the most impoverished areas of rural Afghanistan.

Help: Ms Rowlands sits with, from left, 
Rohullah, 13, a heart surgery patient, Zara, 12, who suffered from club 
feet, and Enjillah, 13, a spinal surgery patient, all of whose 
treatments were paid for by the Woo Foundation

So
far the treatment and care for Zara and 14 other children have been 
paid for by grants from the Karen Woo Foundation established in memory 
of the 36 year-old doctor, from Stevenage, Herts, who was kidnapped and 
murdered in August 2010 in the remote mountainous Badakshan Province to 
the north east of the war ravaged country.

A
former dancer and model, Dr Woo, who specialised in providing maternal 
and neonatal care, was on her third visit to Afghanistan when she and 
nine other aid workers were ambushed in an attack initially blamed on 
the Taliban but still shrouded in mystery.

A
further eight of the children are being helped thanks to the financial 
backing provided by the Linda Norgrove Foundation set-up in memory of 
the 36 year-old Scottish aid worker, who died in October 2010 in a 
failed pre-dawn rescue by US Special Forces after being kidnapped by the
Taliban in Kunar Province, eastern Afghanistan.

Finding her feet: Zara has had three operations to correct her club feet to enable her to walk for the first time. Doctors expect that within six months she will be able to walk freely without pain or difficulties

‘It is so very sad what happened to 
two special women who were doing so much to help the people of 
Afghanistan but I am sure they would have been pleased that part of 
their legacy would be they were continuing to help the children, women 
and families of this country,’ said Ms Rowlands, Project Coordinator for
Le Chaine de l’espoir, the organisation behind The Children’s House.

The 57-year-old, from Conwy, North 
Wales, continued : ‘When Karen came here she would play with the 
children, they loved her and there was a bond – the rural children were 
very close to her and Linda’s hearts ... they helped so many of them in 
so many ways.

‘Both were 
caring young women who gave so much to improve these little people’s 
lives and I am sure they would have been very proud of what is being 
done in their names.

‘While
it is incredibly sad these foundations exist because both girls have 
died, we are delighted their families have the confidence in us and in 
our work to back us.  Their support is changing lives immeasurably for 
the better, the success in each individual case provides hope for 
others.’

Transformation: Eight month-old Abil pictured before and after surgery to correct his cleft lip and palate

Sheltering in a tented area from the 
baking sun with his mother, eight month-old Abil, who underwent an 
operation for a cleft lip, is one of those currently being helped by the
Woo Foundation, set-up by the doctor’s mother and friends to support 
projects dear to her heart.

While
the transformation in 13 year-old Rohullah (open heart surgery) and 
Enjillah (deformity of the spine), has been so great that both were able
to sit happily on swings in the walled garden of the project’s 
headquarters tucked away off a crowded Kabul street and the very real 
threat of the Taliban’s now regular brutal attacks on their targets in 
the capital.

Zara has so far
undergone three operations to correct her clubbed feet and doctors 
expect that within six months she will be able to walk freely without 
pain or difficulties – something her family believes will inspire others
among what they call ‘the forgotten, abandoned people’ living in the 
harsh often desperate rural communities to seek help.

Easily treated: Seven-month-old Esanllah pictured as she arrived at Children's House, before undergoing surgery to correct her cleft palate

Some
have travelled for days to reach the sanctuary that is The Children 
House - one youngster undertook a journey that began with him being 
carried on a relative’s back before he was placed in a wooden cart and 
then transferred to travel through the hills on the back of a donkey.

Bus and car saw him reach Kabul after nearly four days. It is a journey 
he has now made three times but thanks to the medical teams here and 
their expertise to correct his twisted legs, he no longer needs to be 
carried by a relative.

‘Karen and Linda would have been 
pleased that the work done here has spread rapidly by word of mouth so 
that we are being approached for help from throughout Afghanistan,’ said
Ms Rowlands, who has worked in Afghanistan over two decades as well as 
with other humanitarian crisis points such as Iraq and Rwanda while 
overseeing a project backing schools for girls in the Panshir Valley, 
near the Hindu Kush mountain range, some 100 miles north of Kabul.

‘Even
in the most distant, remote border areas where there are no such things
as telephones  families are hearing of us and the fact that we provide 
both medical and after care thanks to the support we receive from the 
charities.

‘Around 100 news
cases a month are being helped with their lives changed forever for the
better and much of it is thanks to the legacy of Karen and Linda.’

New life: Esanllah with her mother in the garden of Children's House after successful surgery to treat her

Miss Norgrove’s parents John and Lorna
travelled to Kabul earlier this year to witnesses how children were 
being helped and yesterday seven month-old Esanllah, recovering from 
surgery to a cleft lip and palate, and Ferous, nine, whose twisted 
deformity of the legs has been corrected, were preparing with members of
their families to leave after work paid for by the foundation.

‘The
foundations have been able to help specific children – we see a lot of 
club feet, heart problems, curvature of the spine and cleft palate and 
lips – and their work makes a huge difference,’ Ms Rowlands said.

‘In
days gone by these children would have died or if they had survived, 
their quality of life would have been very much compromised or they 
would have been outcasts.

‘It
is very difficult for people in Britain to quite understand how remote 
these people are from the kind of health care which we see as part of 
our fabric of life. There is no such thing here, there is a lack of 
education, lack of health care and poverty ... so for children like 
these, unless we help and provide treatment, the future is not good ... 
it is very bleak.’

She added : ‘The perception of Afghanistan is that it is all bad news and that makes me crazy because in places like this (Children’s House), there is so much good and positive news.’

Latifa agreed : ‘It is wonderful what 
has happened to Zara – she has had surgery three times – and is now 
happy that she can walk. She is looking forward so that one day she too 
can play and live like other girls.

‘To
the people of the Karen Woo Foundation I would say thank you for 
changing lives, for helping the children of Afghanistan and thank you 
personally for helping my child. You have made me proud’

A chance to smile: Thanks to their treatments Enjillah and Zara now have hope of overcoming their disabilities

They are heartfelt words that may provide some comfort and pride to the family of Dr Woo – words echoed elsewhere across the Afghan capital by those they are helping at The Childlight Foundation which provides vital equipment for orphanages, holds educational seminars for women and provides clothing, books and other much needed supplies to women’s prisons

Donations to help those at The Children’s House can be made by visiting the websites of the Woo Foundation, the Norgrove Foundation and the The French Medical Institute For Children.
