The Tampa executive who 'systematically executied' his wife and two teenage children before setting fire to their home and killing himself had some outstanding property taxes and put in a leave request for 'unspecified reasons' before exacting his plot, it has emerged.

Darrin Campbell, 49 - who had no criminal record or history of mental illness and was described as being part of what looked to be 'the perfect suburban family' - spent days preparing for the murder-suicide on Wednesday, buying fireworks and cans of gasoline that would destroy his rented Florida mansion.

But according to reports in The Tampa Bay Times, Campbell - who was leasing the five-bedroom home in Avila, known for its luxurious mansions and heavy security, from retired tennis pro James Blake - had recently displayed some odd behavior, in terms of his finances and his career.

In February 2006, Darrin and Kimberly Campbell bought a vacant lot in Odessa for $294,000.

Tragic: Colin, 19 (above), was a well-known member of the varsity baseball team and attended the exclusive and private Carrollwood Day School with his sister, Megan, 15 (below)

In March 2011, the local property owners' association placed a lien on the lot for unpaid association fees totaling $8,000, which were apparently paid by February 2012.

In both 2008 and 2012, Darrin Campbell was delinquent in paying his property taxes on the lot, though the taxes, totaling about $7,800, were eventually paid. 

Taxes on the property for 2013 have not been paid.

'We are conducting a financial audit on him to determine if there were some financial issues,'Hillsborough County sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski said. 

'We do know that he was working up to a point but recently had taken some time off."

Campbell took last week off from his job at VASTEC, the digital records company. 

On Monday, a VASTEC spokesman said, he requested a leave of absence 'for unspecified reasons', which the company approved.

The gun Campbell used in the murders and suicide was a .40-caliber Sig Sauer, a popular handgun he bought in July 2013 at Shooters World, a store and gun range on Fletcher Avenue.

Bruce Kitzis, the store's general manager, said Campbell's only visit there was to buy the gun, and that he passed a federally mandated background check before purchasing the weapon.

'It was (about) a year ago, was the only time he came in. We did the background check and everything was fine,' Kitzis said. 

It's unfortunate. We at Shooters World did everything we could, of course. There are so many wonderful gun owners. It's a tragedy.'

Haunting video: A surveillance video has emerged showing Darrin Campbell dressed in a dark-grey T-shirt and shorts buying a pile of fireworks last Sunday

Evidence: The surveillance footage was recorded inside the store Phantom Fireworks

The firecrackers seen in Campbell's shopping cart in the video were reportedly used to start a fire in his home Wednesday

Business as usual: Store clerk Michael Muti (right) who handled the transaction Sunday recalled that Campbell seemed 'normal and chatty'

Star rental: The Campbell's rented the home from tennis star James Blake, left. Campbell, right, had had a serious of high-profile and senior jobs in various industries. He had apparently been out of work for a year but had recently secured another good job six months ago as the COO of a digital storage company in Tampa

On Sunday, he bought a large number of fireworks and gas cans, which was caught on CCTV. 

On Tuesday, he made two purchases of gasoline from different stores.

Early Wednesday morning, authorities were called to Avila as the Campbell home went up in flames. Campbell was was formally held responsible for the deaths of his wife, Kimberly Campbell, 51, and children Colin Campbell, 18, and Megan Campbell, 15, who were shot in the head in their bedrooms.

He had then placed fireworks throughout the residence, used an accelerant to assist in lighting the fire, lit the fire, and shot himself, Lusczynski.

Family members said Campbell had a 'strong marriage'.

Campbell's mother Mary said they had 'everything to live for' and were a perfect family.

The investigation is likely to focus on Campbell's financial situation.

Local realtors estimate Campbell would have been paying $6,000 a month to rent out the 5,000 sq ft home from former tennis star James Blake.

The family moved into the rented home so that the children could be near to their private school after selling their previous $750,000 home for a profit.

He also had school fees for son Colin,19, and daughter Megan,16, of more than $35,000 a year.

Meanwhile, a surveillance video was released late Thursday showing Darrin Campbell dressed in a dark-grey T-shirt and shorts placing stacks of fireworks into a shopping cart at Phantom Fireworks.

Remains: This aerial photo shows the burned out home owned by James Blake on Thursday, May 8, a day after it was set alight

Sinister: Fireworks were found strewn around the house and police say an accelerant - probably the gas canisters he bought - were used to start the blaze

Fire: The blaze was so ferocious that firefighters could not get in to examine the grisly scene until the next day

At
 one point, Campbell is seen ducking back into an aisle to pick up more 
pyrotechnics before handing the cashier $650 in cash for his purchase.

Store clerk Michael Muti who handled the transaction Sunday recalled Campbell as being 'normal and chatty.'

'He said he was shopping early for fireworks for the Fourth of July,' Muti said.

Neighbors described hearing the fireworks go off as the house burned.

'Geez. What is that popping noise?' a male neighbor said on a 911 call.

The gun Campbell used in the murders and suicide was a .40-caliber Sig Sauer, a popular handgun he bought in July 2013 at Shooters World, a store and gun range on Fletcher Avenue

Another 911 caller, a security manager for the gated community, told dispatchers the fire was in the house's garage.

Firefighters
 have described the scene inside the burnt-out mansion as 'unusual' with
 fireworks littered through the five-bedroom home rented from former 
tennis player Blake, who was ranked fourth in the world in 2006.

Neighbors alerted the emergency authorities when they saw flames leaping from the home. There was no 911 call made from within the property.

According to her Twitter, Megan won an academic award at the school just a day before the deaths.

Darrin
 and Kimberly met in Lansing, Michigan, when they both worked as 
legislative aides in the state legislature. Kimberly Campbell had 
graduated from Central Michigan University and Darrin Campbell had an 
MBA from the University of Michigan, Lambie said.

Away: Blake, pictured with his wife, Emily, was reportedly at their Connecticut residence when the fire broke out

They
 had lived in San Antonio, Texas, where Darrin Campbell was an executive
 with Pearl Brewing Company before they moved to the Tampa area around 
2001 so he could take a job with Anchor Glass Container Corp.

Police
 said the family had been living at the Avila house for about two years.

Neither 
deputies nor the Department of Children and Families had been called to 
the home, officials said.

After
 almost 18 months out of work, Campbell landed a job six months ago as Chief 
Operating Officer for VASTEC, the digital records company.

He
 had previously held senior positions with several south Florida 
companies but no longer for more than three years with any of them.

A former neighbor, George Connley, said they were a nice family. He said that Kimberly Campbell was 'sophisticated and classy.'

'We
 know nothing of any problems,' Connley said. 'The kids were outstanding
 children. This is very difficult to put our arms around.'
