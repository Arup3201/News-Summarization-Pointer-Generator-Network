A four-year-old boy is in a critical condition after nearly drowning in a cruise ship wave pool.

The youngster was 'swept under' while swimming in the Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas off the coast of Florida and is believed to have been submerged for between five and 10 minutes.

He was initially treated by the ship's on-board medical staff before the boat altered course and transported him to the Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Launderdale in Florida.

The vessel was an hour into its journey the incident took place. A passenger on the deck alerted another swimmer when they noticed the child was under the water. 

They then grabbed the boy from underneath and dragged him out of the pool unconscious before medics began CPR. 

Cynthia Martinez, a spokeswoman for Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, confirmed to the Sun-Sentinal that the boy from Italy 'was rescued from one of the ship’s swimming pools.'

Mike Jachles, spokesman for Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue, said that firefighters were told the ship was returning.

He added: 'Obviously, one can only imagine that somebody sets sail on a vacation an hour in, to turn around to something like this. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and with the child.

'We hope the child will recover.' 

The boy, who has yet to be named, was travelling with his two parents and siblings and is not believed to be from the South Florida area. 

It is not known where they were at the time or whether lifeguards are normally stationed at pool side.

Martinez said the cruise liner's care team were providing support for the family and their 'thoughts and prayers were with them'.
