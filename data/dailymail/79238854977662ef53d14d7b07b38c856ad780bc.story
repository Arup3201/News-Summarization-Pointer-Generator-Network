Plan: Ahmed Raofi, 29, became enraged when lover Irene Santos refused to terminate their unborn child

An Afghani minicab driver who tied his pregnant mistress up then forced poisonous pills into her womb in order to abort his unwanted child has been jailed for six years.

Ahmed Raofi, 29, became enraged when lover Irene Santos refused to terminate their unborn child, so he hatched a plan to kill the foetus without her consent.

After hours of internet research, 
Raofi bought packets Misoprostol online and invited Ms Santos to his 
flat  in Edgware, northwest London, on April 9, with the promise of sex, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

He then pounced when Ms Santos was on the bed, taping her hands, feet, and mouth when she began to scream out for help.

Within a few hours, Ms Santon - a Filipino national working in Britain -  began 
getting crippling cramps.

She miscarried the 19-week-old foetus, 
which was still breathing and showed signs of life, paramedics told the court.

The baby survived for ten minutes outside the womb.

Judge Aidan Marron said Raofi had 
‘surreptitiously’ had sex with Ms Santos so that she was naked and that 
he could detain her and force the abortion.

‘Overtures to Ms Santos to terminate 
the baby were to no avail and yet apparently she continued throughout to
 love you dearly,’ Judge Marron said.

‘You obtained drugs to facilitate a 
miscarriage and then surreptitiously engaged in sexual intercourse with 
Ms Santos so when she was naked you could cause the abortion.

'You denied a woman of a much wanted child and the damage to that woman is manifestly profound'

‘You denied a woman of a much wanted child and the damage to that woman is manifestly profound.’

Raofi, of Edgware, northwest London, admitted to administering a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage.

Prosecutor David Markham told the court: ‘Irene
 Santos was the lover of the defendant. The defendant was married to another woman’.

‘The
 defendant had met Ms Santos in late 2011 and they became lovers - she 
knew he was married and that he was not seeking a serious relationship.

‘The
 defendant travelled to Afghanistan in January this year to be with his 
wife and it was then that Ms Santos told him over Skype that she was 
pregnant.

‘He had previously
 made it clear to Ms Santos that the prospect of having a child in these
 circumstances was something he did not want.

‘When
 she became pregnant he wanted her to have an abortion and when she 
refused to do that he took matters into his own had to end the pregnancy
 against her wishes.

‘In 
February he had tried to take Ms Santos to an abortion clinic and booked
 an appointment for her but she refused to go through with it.

‘He told her that he would wait until she was seven months pregnant then, in his words, “punch it out of her”.'

After receiving news of his lover's pregnancy, Raofi returned from Afghanistan to attack Ms Santos, telling her he would ‘punch it out of her,’ Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

Mr Markham said: ‘They had made love 
on the night of April 9 and after that the defendant produced some 
gaffer tape and asked if she wanted a “Chinese massage”.

‘Ms Santos lied naked on her back and 
could feel plastic against her legs - the defendant then pulled her legs
 apart and she then felt at least four tablets go inside her.

‘When she screamed he put the gaffer tape over her mouth.

‘In the early hours of April 10 Ms Santos suffered abdominal cramping and bleeding and called 999.

‘The foetus, which was 19 weeks old, came out her before the ambulance arrived.

‘There were signs of life and a 
paramedic described that he could see the baby breathing and moving for 
at least ten minutes before it died.

‘Ms Santos told a midwife at hospital 
what had happened to her and that is when the police were called and the
 defendant was arrested.’
