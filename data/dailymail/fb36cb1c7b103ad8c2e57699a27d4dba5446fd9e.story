A woman who lost both parents to cancer in the space of two years is running the London Marathon to help raise awareness and funds for research.

Clair O’Hanlon, 28, was heartbroken when her mother mother Kathleen died of ovarian cancer in 2010, aged 56.

Just 26 months later, the family was dealt another devastating blow when her father, Patrick, died from lymphoma.

For a good cause: Clair O'Hanlon is running the London Marathon and raising money for World Cancer Research Fund

The mother-of-one from Colindale, London, was going to hospital for a small operation in summer 2012, but when her 65-year-old father arrived to accompany her, he was immediately taken to A&E.

Now, Ms O'Hanlon is training for the 
London Marathon, raising money for World Cancer Research Fund, which 
funds scientific research and health information programmes to help 
people reduce their risk of getting cancer.

When
 her mother passed away, Miss O’Hanlon, her siblings and her father were
 devastated.

She said: ‘When my mother died, half of my father did.’

Her
 mother Kathleen, a Tesco shop assistant, had suffered from back pain 
for 18 months, but doctors blamed pressure on the sciatic nerve.

Tragedy: Clair's mother Kathleed died from ovarian cancer in 2010, aged just 56, and 26 months later, her father Patrick, 65, succumbed top lymphoma

In March 2010 she was finally sent to undergo a scan, which showed that she had ovarian cancer.

The
 tumour was removed the following month and doctors at University 
College London Hospital were hopeful Kathleen would recover.

However, 19 days later, she was rushed
 back into hospital by her husband Patrick, Ms O'Hanlon's father, and 
she died shortly afterwards.

‘It was incredibly difficult, because it all happened so quickly and I didn’t have any time to process it,' Ms O'Hanlon says.

'It was very shocking. I was in a very bad way after my mum died. I shut down and I didn’t feel like I knew who I was.'

Just
 two years later, on the anniversary of her mother’s funeral, she had to
 take her father into hospital when he was visiting her at her then home
 in County Louth, Ireland.

He
 had gone to support her as she was due to go into hospital for a small 
operation – but arrived looking so unwell that his daughter immediately 
took him to accident and emergency.

She said: ‘He came over to support me but I ended up taking him to hospital. The doctors were very worried and said if we had left it a few more hours he would have been gone.

‘It was all very shocking and I didn’t have time to process it, it was just so overwhelming.’

Her father, a builder, never left the hospital and passed away from lymphoma in July 2012.

'There are no words to describe how it feels to lose both parents to this disease,' said Ms O'Hanlon

Miss O’Hanlon, who has a nine-year-old daughter, said that the pain of losing both her parents made her want to help other people become aware about cancer.

The mother-of-one said: ‘Having lost my mother to cancer, the last thing I ever expected was to lose my dad to it.

‘There are no words to describe how it feels to lose both parents to this disease.

‘Afterwards I was in a really bad way and I shut down. I didn’t know who I was and I wanted to run away from my life.

‘I missed them so much. But I realised I had to keep living because that’s what my parents would have wanted me to do if they were alive.’

Last October, on what would have been her father’s 66th birthday, the accounts manager decided to enter the London Marathon.

Miss O’Hanlon, who has so far raised £1,200 for her first marathon, said: ‘I know so many people affected by different types of cancer, so I wanted to help an organisation that funds research into prevention.

‘Whenever I don’t want to train, I think of my mum and dad and they make me go the extra mile.

‘If I can raise awareness and help other people who are going through the same thing, it will all be worth.’

Paul Fretwell, Head of Fundraising at World Cancer Research Fund, said: ‘We are hugely grateful to Clair for her support. The London Marathon is a serious challenge and an excellent way of raising vital funds for cancer prevention and promoting awareness about the links between cancer and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity.’

Scientists say about a third of cancers could be prevented if people were to maintain a healthy body weight, eat a healthy diet and be physically active.
