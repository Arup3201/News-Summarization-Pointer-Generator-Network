Television viewing figures were up by 20 per cent on last year for the first four of the live FA Cup third round ties.

The audiences for the two games on the BBC peaked at 6.6million for Arsenal vs Hull, a repeat of last year’s FA Cup final, on Sunday evening, and 6.5m for AFC Wimbledon against Liverpool, on Monday, an estimated 28 per cent of the share.

The third round weekend was disrupted by the Barclays Premier League’s decision to run a full fixture list on New Year’s Day, which persuaded the FA to allow clubs to move ties back from the scheduled date on Saturday January 3.

All but four Premier League clubs moved, and some of the match-day attendances were hit. Fewer than 10,000 were at Burnley’s 1-1 draw against Tottenham on Monday night. But the television audience increased.

BT Sport reported a peak of 685,000 for Dover vs Crystal Palace on Sunday lunchtime and 1.3m for Manchester United’s trip to Yeovil.

Everton vs West Ham, the fifth live TV game from the third round, will be screened live by BT Sport from Goodison Park, on Tuesday night.

Liverpool's entertaining 2-1 win at AFC Wimbledon, inspired by skipper Steven Gerrard, attracted 6.5 million viewers on BBC for a Monday night fixture

But despite the TV audience rising by 20 per cent, match attendances were hit across the FA Cup third round with just under 10,000 attending Burnley's 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Monday night at Turf Moor. The Clarets were forced to close the Jimmy McIlroy stand as a result
