Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has lavished praise on former boss David Moyes and hailed the 'confidence' of the Scotsman's successor Roberto Martinez.

Real Sociedad manager Moyes signed Howard from Manchester United in 2006 on an initial season-long loan deal before eventually signing the American goalkeeper on a permanent basis.

And Howard has revealed he thoroughly enjoyed his six-year spell under Moyes.

Speaking to Bleacher Report, Howard said: 'David Moyes was brilliant for me and my hat goes off to him for what he did in his 11 years here. I have a lot of love and respect for David Moyes.

'Roberto has come into the club with ideas and confidence, which is not something that is easy to do because he inherited a bunch of players without a mass exodus.'

Howard, who has been combining his Everton commitments with his role as an analyst on NBC Sports, has stated he is keen on working in the media when he hangs up his gloves.

He added: 'The options are there. The media interests me a lot. You can keep your eye on the game and continue to learn.

'Coaching is the obvious transition, but I'm not 100 per cent that I want to do it. But if the right opportunity presents itself, I'd be open to it.'
