Arsenal travel to Swansea in Sunday's 4pm kick-off, and star forward Alexis Sanchez is confident of bringing three points back to the capital.

Sanchez, who has scored consecutive braces in his last two Premier League matches, took to Twitter on Saturday night to reassure Arsenal fans that they have every reason to feel positive in the lead-up to the match.

'Going to sleep!' he tweeted. 'Tomorrow those 3 points are coming to London!!! #GUNNERS'.

The Chilean forward posted a picture with the confident tweet, showing himself alongside Wojciech Szczesny, Hector Bellerin, Aaron Ramsey, Damien Martinez, Jack Wilshere, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

A win for Arsene Wenger's side will take them above West Ham and back into the top four in the Premier League.

Wilshere is available for the game against Garry Monk's side, after missing the last two matches through illness.

Mikel Arteta has been ruled out (hamstring), but Theo Walcott could make his first start for 11 months.

The home side will be without Jonjo Shelvey, serving his second suspension of the season after being sent off in the Swans' draw at Everton.
