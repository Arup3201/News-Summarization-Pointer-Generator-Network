Prisoners are to be taught how to make the perfect cup of coffee in a bid to help them find work when they leave jail.

Next month inmates at Brixton Prison in south London will learn how to use coffee grinders, pull a shot of espresso and the art of milk steaming in a barista training project.

They will also be taught skills like handling cash, as well as charm and politeness and the need to be welcoming to customers.

The coffee will then be sold in the prison's cafe, which is open to the public four days a week in the visitors' hall.

The prison already runs the Bad Boys' Bakery, which was set up by TV chef Gordon Ramsay to give inmates the chance to develop their cooking skills as well as gain work experience and responsibility.

Inmates bake a range of goods which are sold at the Lower Marsh Saturday market next to Waterloo Station.

Both schemes are run by the National Offender Management Service, with the aim of offering skills and training for inmates.

And with a reported skills shortage in the hospitality industry, it is believed teaching prisoners how to make coffee will boost their chances of finding a job.

Welfare to work provider Working Links runs the projects within Brixton Prison.

Aoibheann Callely, a food production manager told the Times: 'We are going to offer a bespoke customer service award in which prisoners will be taught how to handle cash and softer skills like charm and politeness, as well as the need to smile and be welcoming. All the things you need in a customer-focused job.'

The Bad Boys' Bakery has been a success since being setting up in 2012 in the programme, Gordon Behind Bars.

One of the prisoners in the project, Ian Hughes, 34, also told the newspaper: 'I started learning how to make cakes and stuff. It is great to make a product, finish it off and know it is going to be sold and you hope people like it.

Providing prisoners with skills and training in prison is part of an attempt by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to cut the number of inmates who return to crime after being released.

Not only does the prison run the Bad Boys' Bakery. Earlier this month Clink Restaurant opened at the jail, where visitors are 
served by and eat food prepared by 28 trained prisoners.

The 120-seat restaurant,
 where a three-course menu with coffee costs £21, is housed inside the 
former Regency Roadhouse, which was the old Governor’s house at Brixton 
Prison.

Inmates are trained 
to cook and carry out front-of-house duties, including serving customers
 and working in ‘a true-to-life environment’, according to The Clink 
Charity, which already runs two other prison restaurants, one in HMP 
Cardiff and the other in HMP High Down in Surrey.

Chris Moore, chief executive of The 
Clink Charity, said: ‘The launch of The Clink Restaurant at HMP Brixton 
is testament to the ongoing success of the charity and its positive 
influence on the national rehabilitation of prisoners.

‘Through the use of The
 Clink’s Five Step Model of recruitment, training, auditing, employment 
and mentoring, we are contributing to the reduction in prisoner 
reoffending in the UK.’

Due
 to the location of the restaurant, there’s a strict approval process, 
and interested diners need to fill out a booking enquiry form.
