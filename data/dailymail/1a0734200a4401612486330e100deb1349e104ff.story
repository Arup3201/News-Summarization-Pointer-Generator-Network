Just moments after he gunned down Canadian Parliament shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, heroic sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers was seen calmly walking through the halls, gun in hand.

The 58-year-old RCMP veteran has been hailed a hero after putting a swift stop to the attacker's hail of gunfire after he shot dead a soldier and then stormed the building on Wednesday morning.

A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant. 

Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.

Job done: Kevin Vickers, Canada's House of Commons' sergeant-at-arms, looks around the hallways with a gun in his hand after shooting dead an attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Wednesday morning

In control: Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before taking on the role, is being hailed a hero

Despite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone.

 

Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused. 

A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.

At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.

The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.

As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

Inches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms

And like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise.

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred. 

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.' 

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke. 

Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians.

Vickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanks

He released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg. 

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting. 

Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.  

On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.  

'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said. 

Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.

'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. 

I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. 

We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

Arrest: An unidentified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as security concerns are still high across Ottawa

Chilling footage appears to have caught the moment that gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau got into a hijacked car moments after shooting a soldier dead at Ottawa's War Memorial.

Footage from a dashcam appears to show the Muslim convert climb into the driver's side of a Toyota Corolla that - according to witnesses - he had stolen earlier.

Zehaf-Bibeau stormed the Parliament minutes later having abandoned the car in the street with the engine running after he had driven a short distance from the cenotaph.

A shoot-out with armed officials ensued, with Zehaf-Bibeau eventually shot dead by Vickers as shocked politicians and journalists barricaded themselves in rooms and cowered in corridors.

One eye witness said that as many as 30 shots were fired in the exchange, which took place just yards away from where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking. 

The 32-year-old had callously shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, in the stomach at point-blank range while he was on ceremonial duty.

Despite the desperate efforts of medics, Mr Cirillo succumbed to his injuries in hospital.

A witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barrelled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'.

He added: 'It was pretty intense.'
