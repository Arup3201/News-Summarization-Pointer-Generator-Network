A woman was horrified when she bit into a piece of newly-bought cheese - and a stranger's tooth fell out.

Jane Betts, 42, had bought the Wensleydale Jervaulx Blueat from Sainsbury's last week for an after-dinner treat.

But when she put a piece in her mouth, she bit on something hard, and a tooth fell to the floor.

Horrified: Jane Betts, 42, was disgusted when she ate a piece of cheese, bit on something hard, and a tooth fell to the floor. The tooth (pictured right) has been verified as human by a dentist and is believed to be dental work

Alarmed, Mrs Betts first checked she had not lost one of her own teeth before realising she had been chewing on someone else's.

She took the tooth to a dentist who confirmed it belonged to a human.

Mrs Betts, from Cambridge, said: 'This was extremely disturbing and even more so as I had just been to the dentist myself the day before.

'Because of this I thought a piece of my own dental work had come off.

'I was completely disgusted to find that it was in fact someone else's.

'I was also very confused for several minutes as I searched my mouth and all my teeth looking for where the piece had come off.

'Now I just feel sick.

Investigation: Mrs Betts had no more of the blue cheese that is now being examined by Cambridge City Council

'It was a bizarre and truly horrible coincidence.'

The
 tooth - which is believed to be dental work - has been handed to the 
environmental health team at Cambridge City Council for investigation.

A
 council spokesman said: 'We will undertake the necessary investigation 
to determine the nature and possible source of that contaminant.

'Please rest assured that if any business or food producer, irrespective of size or type, is considered to be liable for contaminating food, or any other food offence, we will instigate the appropriate enforcement action.'

Sainsbury's said: 'We take great pride in the quality of all the food we sell.

'We have spoken to Jane and will of course support the environmental health officer with any investigation.'
