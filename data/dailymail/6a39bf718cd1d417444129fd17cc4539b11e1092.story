Ukip has been condemned as 'absolutely vile' by Labour rising star Chuka Umunna, who accused Nigel Farage of trying to blame foreigners for all of Britain's problems.

In his most outspoken attack yet, Mr Umunna said Ukip was 'sowing the seeds of division' by accusing 'that bunch over there' of being responsible for a shortage of housing, GP appointments and well-paid jobs.

The shadow business secretary attacked Ukip's 'abhorrent' language about immigrants and the 'distasteful' spectacle of the Ukip Calypso song performed by DJ Mike Read in a mock Jamaican accent.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna condemned the 'abhorrent' views of Nigel Farage's Ukip which he claimed often go unchallenged 

Mr Umunna has been a leading critic of Ukip's anti-immigrant rhetoric, and has stepped up his attacks in recent weeks after Labour appeared to be losing ground to the Eurosceptic party.

In his latest broadside, he warned that Ukip is now part of the political mainstream but is not judged by the same standards as other parties.

He accused Mr Farage's party of using the same language about Eastern European immigrants as once was used against black and Asian people who moved to Britain.

He told LBC radio: 'They are asking people to give them the benefit of the doubt when a stream of Ukip candidates and supporters have come out with the most offensive and racist things over the months.

'What really worries me about this is there is not more of a row about the things we see coming out of Ukip. It's almost as if people price this in.

'They are now arguably one of the main parties, and a lot of this stuff is vile, is absolutely vile, and it's not in keeping with our British values of respect, tolerance and fair play.'

A new racism row erupted this week with the release of Ukip Calypso, in which Read sang in a Jamaican-accent warning of 'illegal immigrants in every town.

Read himself has insisted it was just 'a bit of fun', adding: 'I don't have a racist bone in my body. I work across all cultures and creeds, I travel the world. I've got so many chums out in the Caribbean. I've spent a lot of time out there.'

But Mr Umunna, the son of a Nigerian migrant, said the song 'distasteful', adding: 'A lot of people have said they think it's racist. I don't know whether his intention was to be racist.'

The rise of Ukip has led to a growing debate about the need to control immigration, with David Cameron promising curbs on freedom of movement within the EU.

But Mr Umunna accused Ukip of using attacks on migrants to blame them for problems in Britain.

'What I find really awful is this notion that somehow all the problems in our country are caused by immigration.

'All the problems that you have, whether it's a getting an appointment at your GP, the fact you aren't earning enough at work, the fact your child can't get a house round the corner from you, is down to Eastern European immigration. It isn't. It's a con. It is misleading and wrong.

'Seeking to blame it on "that bunch over there" is a complete con.'

Ex-Radio 1 DJ Mike Read has launched a bid for chart success with a song singing the praises of Ukip and its leader Nigel Farage

Mr Umunna went on: 'The reason I find it abhorrent – I'll be frank, my name is Chuka Umunna, clearly I'm of immigrant stock - is the kind of things you hear people saying about eastern Europeans these days is exactly the kinds of things they were saying about black and Asian people when they first arrived in this country.

'We can't have any truck with that. That is not what we are as Brits.'

Mr Farage has repeatedly denied Ukip is racist and vowed to root out members and candidates with offensive views.

But he faced fury from Jewish community leaders yesterday after he formed a pact with a Polish MEP whose party leader has been accused of denying the Holocaust to get EU funding.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was 'gravely concerned' by Ukip's deal to accept a member of the Polish Congress of the new Right (KNP) into its grouping in the European Parliament.

Robert Iwaszkiewicz's decision to join the Eurosceptic EFDD (Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy) group headed by Mr Farage means it has enough members to increase its funding and standing in the parliament.
