George Osborne said today that if the Scottish Nationalists win the independence referendum they will not be able to keep their currency

The pound is not an asset to be divided up ‘as if it were a CD collection’ and an independent Scotland will not be allowed to share it, George Osborne insisted yesterday.

The Chancellor was backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats as he delivered a stunning blow to Alex Salmond’s dream of persuading Scots to vote to break away from the UK.

In a highly unusual move, the top civil servant at the Treasury, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, agreed that sharing sterling with an independent Scotland would be ‘fraught with difficulty’.

He concluded: ‘I would advise against entering a currency union with an independent Scotland.’

In a choreographed series of interventions designed to inflict maximum damage on the ‘yes’ campaign, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and Labour’s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls also insisted they would never agree to share the pound in a formal currency union.

That would mean that if it wanted to continue to use sterling, an independent Scotland would be reduced to the position of a country like Panama, which uses the US dollar but has absolutely no say over the management of the currency, or Zimbabwe, which uses the dollar and the euro.

The warnings prompted a furious reaction from the Scottish Nationalists - who issued an extraordinary threat to default on their part of the national debt in retaliation if they win the independence referendum taking place on September 18.

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘The debt is legally the Treasury’s. Scotland can’t default on debt that is not legally Scotland’s.’

She said the SNP wanted to keep the pound and enter into a formal ‘currency union’ with the remainder of the UK - but said there were other options, including using sterling without a currency union or adopting a new currency for Scotland.

She insisted Mr Osborne was ‘bluffing’ and would moderate his position if Scots did back independence.

But Mr Osborne insisted that while independence would expose Scotland to bigger economic risks, a currency union would oblige taxpayers in the remainder of the UK to bail them out if things went wrong.

That prospect was ‘patently absurd’, the Chancellor said in a speech in Edinburgh. ‘If Scotland walks away from the UK, it walks away from the UK pound.

‘The SNP says that if Scotland becomes independent, there will be a currency union and Scotland will share the pound. People need to know that is not going to happen.

‘Because sharing the pound is not in the interests of either the people of Scotland or the rest of the UK.’

A letter from Sir Nicholas to Mr Osborne, released by the Treasury, also dismissed the prospect of a currency union with an independent Scotland. It is almost unprecedented for such politically contentious advice from a senior civil servant to be released.

Sir Nicholas warned that Scotland’s banking sector is too big in relation to national income, and the UK could end up having to bail the country out. He also told the Chancellor that the SNP’s threat to refuse a share of the UK’s debt is not credible.

‘Currency unions between sovereign states are fraught with difficulty. They require extraordinary commitment, and a genuine desire to see closer union between the peoples involved,’ the Treasury permanent secretary said.

‘What worries me about the Scottish Government’s putative currency union is that it would take place against the background of a weakening union between the two countries, running counter to the direction of travel in the eurozone.

‘I would advise strongly against a currency union as currently advocated, if Scotland were to vote for independence.’

Mr Alexander, the most senior Scot in the Government, challenged Mr Salmond to a debate on Scottish independence ‘any time, any place anywhere’ accusing the Nationalist leader of ‘cowering in his bunker’.

Mr Salmond hit back, saying: ‘This is a concerted bid by a Tory-led Westminster establishment to bully and intimidate - but their efforts to claim ownership of sterling will backfire spectacularly in terms of reaction from the people of Scotland, who know that the pound is as much theirs as it is George Osborne’s.’
