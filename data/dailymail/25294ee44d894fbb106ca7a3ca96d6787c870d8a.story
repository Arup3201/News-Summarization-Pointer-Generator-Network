Our favourite celebrities are often spotted toting the most covetable arm candy but have you ever wondered what lies within their Saint Laurents and Celines? 

The likes of Daisy Lowe, Millie Mackintosh and Jools Oliver have opened up their handbags to give FEMAIL a sneak peek at exactly what they lug around all day.

So what does Mrs Professor Green carry in her handbag? A cheeky glance inside Millie's bag shows she stays true to the brands she's the face of - including Sure and Rodial - plus Palmer's moisturiser, Nanoblur cream and Tresemme dry shampoo.

What's in her handbag? Millie Mackintosh has opened her handbag for Cath Kidston's new campaign, which sees celebrities pledging their allegiance to being either a #totesbig or #totessmall kind of girl and revealing what they carry in their everyday bags

The party girl also has a pack of Berocca (perhaps to nurse those hangovers), a pair of aviator sunglasses, a fan and the book Half A Yellow Sun by he Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

As a young, rich and famous supermodel, it comes as little surprise that Daisy Lowe's handbag is full to the brim with designer goodies.

As well as a red Chanel purse, she's got a swanky crocodile skin diary, Elizabeth Arden 8-hour cream and Nars foundation.

Not a recipe book in sight! Jools Oliver opened up her tote and there were some family snaps, tissues and beads- and a little note from Jamie Oliver in there, too

The oh-so-virtuous Anna Friel has a stash of nuts and a guide to the Master Cleanse diet beloved by Beyonce.

There's also some designer perfume, relaxing oils and what looks like a film script crammed into her red handbag.

Pint-sized Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson has a camera, headphones and party poppers in her Cath Kidston tote - all the party essentials, then.

Singer Jessie Ware is somewhat of a beauty buff with her Calvin Klein lipsticks and Sisley, Caudalie and Darphin creams, while the oh-so-glamorous Nicola Roberts keeps her handbag essentials to a minimum but has managed to squeeze in a product from her own Dainty Doll make-up range.

The celebrities opened their handbags for Cath Kidston's new campaign, which aims to reveal what your handbag says about you, and marks the launch of their new totes.

With a focus on the two tribes women fall into - either being the kind of girl who carries everything but the kitchen sink or the kind that only carries the bare essentials - Cath Kidston will launch a photographic exhibition on August 22.

Titled 'Do You Like Yours Big or Small?' at their flagship store, the exhibition features the celebrities pledging their allegiance to being either a #totesbig or #totessmall kind of girl and revealing what they carry in their everyday bags.
