North Korea has tested short-range missiles in the Sea of Japan today in an attempt to counter-act joint U.S. and South Korean military exercises close to its borders.

South Korea had begun flexing is military muscle today in response to threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un - as tensions between the two countries continue to escalate.

But the North has hit back by testing missiles in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. Kim Jong Un also accused South Korea and the U.S. of being behind a cyber attack which led to a two-day Internet blackout.

Escalating tension: South Korea sends a K-55 self-propelled howitzer tank to the border city of Paju

High alert: South Korean troops patrol the western island of Yeonpyeong, just eight miles from North Korea

South Korean news agency Yonhap 
reported: 'North Korea test-launched a short-range missile in the East 
Sea this afternoon, amid the ongoing security crisis on the Korean 
peninsula following Pyongyang’s third nuclear test last month.

The North Korean military launched two KN-02 short-range missiles into international waters, the agency added.

South Korea had earlier sent a K-55 
self-propelled howitzer tank to the border city of Paju, while its 
soldiers patrolled the coastline on the western island of Yeonpyeong, 
less than eight miles from North Korea.

The display of strength came as North
Korea accused South Korea and the U.S. of being behind a  cyberattack, 
which caused a two-day Internet black out.

It follows the North carrying out exercises with live artillery yesterday close to the disputed border.

Kim Jong Un, who supervised the drills, has also issued a series of inflammatory threats against South Korea and the U.S. in recent days.

Prepared: South Korea and the U.S. recently carried out their own drills, which enraged North Korea

On edge: Tensions between the North and South have escalated after a ceasefire was ended this month

U.S. soldiers were today pictured working with South Korean troops at a United States military post in the capital Seoul.

The two countries recently carried out their own drills inside the South, which enraged North Korea.

North Korea said the South
and its ally were behind the temporary Internet shut down yesterday and Wednesday - but 
experts said it is too early to determine what happened.

Few details of the attack have been provided by North Korean state news agency Korean Central News Agency.

Foreigners in the capital Pyongyang 
reported no Internet access - which is only available to a small number 
of North Koreans.

The Bangkok-based company that operates North Korea's Internet confirmed a cyberattack but said networks are normal today.

Technological warfare: The South has denied it was behind the cyberattack, while the U.S. declines to comment

South Korea denied the allegation that it was behind the attack, while the U.S. declined to comment.

Security experts said cyberattack 
investigations can take months and that individual hackers are more 
likely to blame than governments in this case.

The country claims to be capable of a nuclear strike against the U.S. and earlier this month cancelled the ceasefire signed with South Korea at the end of the Korean War in 1953.

The UN has imposed sanctions on the secretive country in a bid to stifle its missile programmes, which has enraged the north.

Reaction: North Korea's drills are partly a response to military exercises being held by the U.S. and South Korea

Supervising: North Korea's latest drill was overseen by leader Kim Jong Un, pictured with his generals

Over the past few days Kim Jong Un has been reported as threatening 'all-out war' and telling troops to 'cut the enemies windpipes'.

North Korea has demanded a a formal peace treaty, complete with security guarantees and other concessions, including the removal of 28,500 U.S. troops from South Korea.

It is feared the escalating tensions between the countries will bubble over into war on the peninsula.

In 2010, South Korean civilians in Yeonpyeong were killed on an island being shelled by North Korea.
