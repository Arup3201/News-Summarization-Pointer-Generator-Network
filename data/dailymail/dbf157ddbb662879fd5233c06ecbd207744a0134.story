The CSIRO, the government science research organisation, is shutting down its bowel cancer and neurological research programs, due to budget cuts to the organisation.

CSIRO announced the closure of the research programs, which investigate treatment and early detection strategies for colo-rectal and bowel cancers, as well as neurological illnesses such as dementia and Alzheimer's.

The program closures result from cuts to CSIRO funding announced in the most recent federal budget, which stripped $115 million of funding from CSIRO, forcing a a 20 percent reduction of staff between June 2013 and June 2015.

'It's not a throwaway line about making CSIRO more efficient, these budget cuts directly result in shutting down areas of research, and we want our elected representatives to be more transparent about that,' CSIRO Staff Association Secretary Sam Popovski told Daily Mail Australia.

'You're essentially down to the bare bones, there's not a lot left to cut. We want to make people making these decisions accountable as to what happens as a result.'

Due to funding cuts last year, there were 513 redundancies at CSIRO, reducing their total workforce from 6,500 by eight percent, to 5,964 in June 2013.

It is estimated that another 750 jobs will be cut across the organisation in the next financial year, meaning CSIRO will suffer a 20 percent reduction of staff in two years.

Overall CSIRO will lose 20 percent of its staff in two years, necessitating the closure of the bowel cancer and neurological illness research programs

Bowel Cancer Australia CEO Julien Wiggins said the closure of CSIRO's bowel and rectal cancer research program was 'a step backwards', especially given that bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in Australia.

'Any cuts to bowel cancer are of serious concern. 15,000 people are diagnosed each year, and funding to bowel cancer research currently doesn't reflect the burden of disease accurately in this country,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

He stated that while bowel cancer accounts for around 13 percent of all cancer diagnosis, research funding has typically not reflected the burden of disease, receiving between 7 and 10 percent of NHMRC funding for cancer research and treatment.

While there are other government, not-for-profit and commercial groups engaged in bowel cancer research, Mr Wiggins pointed to CSIRO's involvement in developing a blood test for bowel cancer that is currently being piloted in the Blue Mountains for people who cannot or will not carry out screening with the recommended stool test.

'It's really a sad day for bowel cancer.'

The areas of CSIRO that will suffer job cuts have not been fully announced, but are set to include 40 jobs across both the colorectal cancer and neurosciences research areas, and eight full-time researchers from Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong who investigate bio-security threats to humans that can be transmitted from animals.

Mr Popovski said the morale at CSIRO is 'very despondent'.

'These latest cuts to CSIRO are particularly illogical and short-sighted,' he said. 'We want to make people making these decisions accountable.'
