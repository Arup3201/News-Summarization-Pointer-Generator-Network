A postal worker has been accused of trying to kill her husband with a tuna fish sandwich.

Investigators said they had yet to establish a motive for the attempted murder.

According to the Polk County Sheriff's Office, deputies were called to Richards' home where they were met by her husband, Gregory Lawrence Richards, and her step-sister, Jessica Jarvis.

Jarvis told police Richards had told her earlier in the day that she had crushed a quantity of Trazodone pills and put them in her husband's lunch.

Mr Richards said he had eaten part of the sandwich and felt sick.

He was taken to Lake Wales Medical Center, where he was treated for nausea and dizziness.

According to the National Institutes of Health, Trazodone is used to treat depression and increases the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.

During the investigation into Richards, who works as a US Mail carrier, a small quantity of cannabis was found.

Richards faces charges attempted First Degree Murder, Poisoning Food with the intent to Kill, Possession of Cannabis and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.

She is being held in Polk County Jail without bail.
