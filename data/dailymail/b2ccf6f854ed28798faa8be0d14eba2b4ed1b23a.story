Anger: The Labour leader criticised the Government for its ‘inexplicable silence’ over civilian casualties in the Palestinian territory under attack from Israel

Ed Miliband’s ‘ultra-critical’ attack on David Cameron’s response to the Gaza crisis will hamper Britain’s ability to help bring about peace in the Middle East, the Tories said yesterday.

The Labour leader criticised the Government for its ‘inexplicable silence’ over civilian casualties in the Palestinian territory and its failure to tell Israel that its actions are ‘unacceptable and unjustifiable’.

Yesterday Justice Secretary Chris Grayling hit back, saying ultra-critical comments about Israel would make it harder for Britain to help find a peaceful solution.

And Downing Street accused Mr Miliband of playing politics with the Middle Eastern conflict because he feels the public is increasingly taking the side of the Palestinians. 

As the row intensified, Mr Grayling said: ‘I think we in Britain have to be enormously careful to try and work in a way that encourages a ceasefire, encourages an end to the action on both sides.

‘I don’t think it helps if we make strong comments that are going to put us in less of a position to do that.’

The row came as an Israeli strike killed ten and wounded 35 at a United Nations school in the town of Rafah, which was being used as a shelter for people displaced by the 27-day conflict between Israel and Hamas. 

UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon described it as a ‘moral outrage and a criminal act’.

But Mr Cameron has refused to join a growing international clamour led by those who regard Israel’s tactics as disproportionate.

The Labour leader had said the Prime Minister was ‘wrong’ not to oppose Israel’s incursion into Gaza, adding: ‘His silence on the killing of hundreds of innocent Palestinian civilians caused by Israel’s military action will be inexplicable to people across Britain and internationally.’

Last night Mr Miliband, who describes himself as an ‘atheist Jew’, stood by his comments. He told Channel 4 News: ‘I speak as a friend of Israel ... but I think that day by day, as we see these outrages on our television screens, Israel is losing friends in the international community.’

More than 60 of Mr Miliband’s relatives are believed to have been killed in the Holocaust.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We are shocked that Mr Miliband would seek to misrepresent [Mr Cameron’s] position and play politics with such a serious issue.’

More than 1,750 Palestinians have died since Israel began its operation to prevent Hamas missile strikes into its territory and block tunnels used to launch cross-border raids. 

Israel has lost 64 soldiers and three civilians.

█ Jon Snow has been accused by his peers of peddling propaganda in his reporting on Gaza.

The Channel 4 News presenter made an online video appeal that described the growing death toll among children and called for action from viewers. 

‘We actually share some responsibility for those deaths, because for us it is no priority whatsoever to stop it,’ he said in the YouTube clip.

But BBC Afghanistan Correspondent David Loyn criticised him, saying: ‘Emotion is the stuff of propaganda, and news is against propaganda.’ 

Channel 4 News said the clip received ‘overwhelmingly positive feedback’.

Buried: Rescuers claw at the rubble of a house after finding a young boy trapped by an Israeli air strike

Trapped in the rubble, a wounded boy cries in terror and pain as Palestinian rescuers fight to free him.

The youngster was pulled to safety from the rubble of a house destroyed by an airstrike in Rafah that killed at least nine members of the same family.

After another day of bloodshed, UN officials said it was powerless to help many of the injured because almost half of Gaza’s medics are unable to get to work.

Rafah has been targeted by Israeli strikes from land, sea and air.

Palestinians say corpses are littering the streets and casualties have to be treated on the floors of overcrowded hospitals, which have also been hit.
