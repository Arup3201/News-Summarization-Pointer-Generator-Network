Chrysler is recalling nearly 870,000 SUVs because corrosion may make the vehicles' brakes harder to use.

Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs from the 2011 through 2014 model years are involved.

Chrysler says crimp joints in the brake boosters can corrode if they're exposed to water.

Recall: Chrysler Group said on Wednesday it would recall nearly 870,000 vehicles to fix a defect in the brake systems following complaints about excessive brake-pedal firmness

Defect: Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said the recalled vehicles will be installed with a shield to protect brake boosters from corrosion caused by water exposure

If the water freezes, the boosters won't aid braking as they usually do.

Chrysler began investigating after some customers said their brakes felt too firm when pressed down. The company knows of one accident, but no injuries, due to the defect.

Dealers will install a shield to protect the boosters for free and replace boosters that aren't working properly.

Chrysler has since changed the design to make the boosters more corrosion resistant.

Chrysler will notify owners of the recall, which involves 867,795 vehicles.

Replacement: The company said in a statement Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs, model years 2011-2014, were under inspection and brake boosters would be replaced wherever necessary

When Chrysler first became aware of a problem last spring, it concluded vehicles would still meet federal standards and began adding a coating to new parts. But cold weather set in, and owners contacted the safety agency after water that had entered the brake booster froze, affecting braking performance.

New models, increasingly complex technology and heightened regulatory scrutiny have led to more auto recalls.

Chrysler told the safety agency that it had noted more warranty claims than expected in May, and by July, it had figured out the corrosion problem.

At the time, it concluded a recall was not necessary because while drivers would need to push the pedal harder, there was no loss of braking.

The automaker said it was justified in handling the matter as a â€œquality initiativeâ€
