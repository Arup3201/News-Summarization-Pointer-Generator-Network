The man behind Apple's maps software has been sacked in a major restructuring of the computer giant's executives after he refused to apologise for its Maps software.

Scott Forstall, a long-time lieutenant of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, was asked to leave following years of friction with other top executives and his recent refusal to take responsibility for the mishandling of the Apple's much-criticized mapping software, people familiar with the situation said.

Sources said Forstall refused to sign a public apology after Apple's mapping product, which displaced the popular Google Maps on the iPhone and the iPad in September, contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce criticism.

Instead, CEO Tim Cook signed the letter last month.

Forstall will leave the company next year, Apple said in a statement.

It also confirmed that John Browett, who was hired as the 
company's retail chief just seven months ago after serving as CEO of 
U.K. electronics retailer Dixon's, will also leave Apple.

The UK executive was Mr Cook's first major appointment and, when his recruitment was announced in January, said that Mr Browett had a commitment to customer service "'like no one else we've met.'

Mr Browett, who relocated to California in April for the job, was awarded a $56m (£36m) 'golden hello' for joining Apple.

The payment, due to be made over five years, dwarfed the £1m pay package he collected for running Dixons.

His efforts to improve profits at the 
stores had alienated employees and sources close to Apple said Cook had 
concluded he was simply the wrong person for the job.

'These changes show that Tim Cook is 
stamping his authority on the business,' said Ben Wood, analyst with 
CCS Insight, said.

'Perhaps disappointed with the Maps issues, Forstall 
became the scapegoat.'

A retail high-flier credited with reviving the fortunes of PC World and Currys, former Dixons boss John Browett today left the technology giant in a shock exit that comes after he joined in April to head up its global store chain.

Mr Browett relocated to California and was reportedly awarded a "golden hello" package worth up to 56 million US dollars (£36 million) to drive expansion of Apple's shop portfolio as senior vice president of retail.

He was seen as being one of Apple chief executive Tim Cook's key hires and was described by him at the time as having commitment to customer service "like no one else we've met".

But it is understood Mr Browett, who joined Dixons at the end of 2007 and overhauled the business following a period of under-performance, caused a backlash among employees by trying to cut back hours and staff numbers, before the group quickly reversed the changes.

The executive changes are the biggest at Apple in more than a decade, and mark the first major move by Cook to shape his own management team since Jobs' death a year ago.

While Apple has enjoyed enormous success since Cook took the helm, recent stumbles including the Maps debacle and several earnings disappointments have underscored the long-term challenges the company faces in retaining its dominance in the smartphone and tablet markets.

In Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics, Apple faces an array of powerful competitors who are determined to own a piece of the exploding mobile-computing market.

'Competition is moving much faster to be more Apple-like,' said Tim Bajarin, president of technology research and consulting firm Creative Strategies.

The executive changes hand substantially more responsibility to Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple's celebrated industrial design chief, who will now oversee both hardware and software design.

Eddy Cue, a long-serving executive who runs online products, will take charge of Apple Maps and the Siri voice search software.

Craig Federighi, who oversees the OSX software that powers the Macintosh computers, will take charge of the iOS software.

Putting the mobile and personal 
computer software teams together under Federighi could improve 
operations within the company, particularly as the capabilities and 
features of smartphones and PCs increasingly converge, said analysts.

Ive, now responsible for design across
 all products, has played a key role in Apple's success by imbuing its 
gadgets with a distinct look and feel.

BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said
 Ive could now help reinvigorate the look of Apple's software, which 
has been slow to evolve.

'If you have two different heads, you have two different fiefdoms,' he said.

The retail stores will report directly to Cook while a search is conducted for a new head of the division.

Shares of Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company by market value, have declined 14 percent in the past month since reaching a 52-week high of $705.07 in September.

Apple's maps was plagued with problems

People with knowledge of Apple's 
inner workings said Scott Forstall's departure was years in the making, and 
came to a head with the Apple Maps incident.

A 15-year veteran of the company, 
Forstall was once considered a possible CEO candidate and is credited 
with playing a central role in making the iPhone and the iPad two of the
 most successful consumer electronics products ever.

But Forstall was also considered a 
hard person to work with, and he alienated other senior executives with 
his abrasive style, one person familiar with the situation said.

This person added that once Jobs passed away, Forstall was left with few defenders at the top of the company.

The fate of the executive, who had 
1,000 people directly reporting to him, was sealed by the Maps debacle.

Even after a public uproar over the shortcomings and widespread calls 
for Apple to revert to Google Maps, Forstall would not acknowledge the 
gravity of the problem, a source with knowledge of the matter said.

Forstall instead likened the situation
 to the complaints over the antenna in an earlier iPhone and insisted it
 would blow over without a public mea culpa, the source said. But Cook 
disagreed, and issued a public apology with his own signature on it 
after Fortstall would not go along, the source added.

Apple described Monday's moves as a 
way to increase 'collaboration' across its hardware, software and 
services business.

Forstall will serve as an advisor to Cook until his 
departure.
