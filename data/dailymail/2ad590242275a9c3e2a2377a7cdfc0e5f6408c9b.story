A mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant.

Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan.

Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there.

'Disgusted': Carrie Davies, pictured with four-month-old Trystan, said 
she was 'ashamed and embarrassed' after being asked to move while 
breastfeeding - but staff said they only wanted her to feel more comfortable

The mother of three, from Caerphilly, South Wales, says she is 'disgusted' by the incident, which made her feel like she was doing something shameful.

Ms Davies said: 'She told me I could not breastfeed in the dining area and asked me to sit in a corner by the toilets.

'I felt like a naughty school child who had been stuck in the corner. It was meant to be a nice girlie lunch but they made me feel like I was doing something disgusting. They made me feel embarrassed and ashamed.'

'I did not want to make a fuss, so I just moved, but my son got upset and I got upset. I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible, so we paid the bill and left.

'I was utterly disgusted by the company’s disregard for the breastfeeding laws we have in the UK.'

Ms Davies, who also has an 
eight-year-old son and a daughter, five, said she had never had a 
problem breastfeeding in other restaurants.

She
 said: 'I have never come across such an attitude towards nursing 
mothers - it’s no wonder people are put off breastfeeding their babies.

Carrie Davies is the latest of a string of mothers who have been singled out for breastfeeding in public.

Earlier this month Rhea Holly was called 'disgusting' and a 'slut' by customers at a Costa Coffee shop in London.

It came hot on the heels of a mass protest organised by outraged mothers outside a Sports Direct outlet in Nottingham, where Wioletta Komar had been told not to feed her son because of 'company policy'.

More shockingly, even hospitals have stigmatised mothers.

Allison Smith, 32, was told to use a 'dingy' storage cupboard at a children's hospital in Sydney, Australia, three weeks ago rather than feed her son in public.

'I
 have breastfed all three of my children, but in the past, I felt there 
was too much of a stigma attached to breastfeeding to do it in public.

'It is only now I’m a bit older that I feel comfortable to do it in public, so I did not expect to be accosted like this.'

'I wear nursing tops, so I can feed my son whenever he’s hungry without anyone even seeing my breast.'

The Equality Act 2010 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place, such as a restaurant, cafe, shop or public transport.

But restaurant bosses say they only made the suggestion so that Ms Davies could be more comfortable feeding her son.

David Sun, a manager at the restaurant, said: 'We welcome everybody and breastfeeding is no problem at all. We deal with thousands of customers and we understand the law.'

'We regularly have customers breastfeeding in our restaurant, but often, they ask a member of staff if there is a quite area available. It is a huge restaurant and we are always able to provide a quite corner for mums to breastfeed in peace.

'On this occasion, the customer was sitting at the table to breastfeed, so one of our members of staff approached her to ask her if she would prefer to go to a quiet area that might be more convenient for her.

'At the time, we had 130 kids in the restaurant on a school outing and we thought the customer might feel more comfortable in a more private area of the restaurant.'

The
 Equality Act 2010 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding 
woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport

It states that a business cannot discriminate against mothers who are breastfeeding a child of any age.

In
 Government guidelines, companies are advised to make sure women they 
are providing a service to 'are allowed to breast feed on your premises 
if they want to'.

It also advises that staff are trained to understand the rights of breast feeding mothers.

Under the Act 2010, discriminating against someone because they are with a breastfeeding mother is also prohibited.
