A hockey superfan with a rare heart condition broke down in tears when he was allowed to take to the ice with his favourite team.

Sam Tageson was met with roars from the more than 17,000 spectators at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, when he skated out with players from the San Jose Sharks.

As he waved to the crowd, the 17-year-old was overcome with emotion at the moment that doctors who treat his hypoplastic left-heart syndrome said he'd never be able to experience.

Touching moment: Sam Tageson lives the Sharks fan's dream as more than 17,000 spectators cheer him at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, after he took to the ice with the players from his favourite NHL team

Against the odds: As he waved to the crowd, the 17-year-old was overcome with emotion at the moment that doctors who treat his hypoplastic left-heart syndrome said he'd never be able to experience

Special day: Sam's moment in the spotlight on Tuesday night came after a full day training with the Sharks, who had officially signed him up on a special one-day contract so he could experience life in the NHL

'It's really awesome. I like it a lot,' Sam told NHL.com. 'It's a once-in-a lifetime experience.'

Despite warnings from doctors, Sam has been playing ice hockey since he was six years old.

A birth defect means his heart has just two chambers instead of four, but he has refused to allow the supposedly debilitating condition to hold him back.

Sam's mother, Lisa Mills, told the San Jose Mercury News: 'They said he would be the child that would never ride a bicycle, never do any of that. He rides a skateboard. He plays hockey.

'The doctors all through the years have said give him golf clubs, take the hockey stick away. We tried. It doesn't work.

'Now they've given up telling him no. They say he'll stop when he knows it's time.'

The climax of Sam's day came when he donned a No. 20 shirt and skated onto the ice with his new teammates through their shark's head tunnel to line up with them before their league game against the Florida Panthers

Land of the free and the home of the brave: It was the first time in the history of the San Jose Sharks that anyone other than an active player had joined the team on the ice for the singing of the national anthem

Sam's moment in the spotlight on Tuesday night came after a full day training with the Sharks, who had officially signed him up on a special one-day contract so he could experience life in the NHL.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the condition that Sam was born with, is a rare congenital heart defect that affects just 960 babies every year in the U.S.

In babies with the condition, the aorta and left ventricle are underdeveloped, and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small for enough blood to flow, or are closed off altogether.

As a result, the right ventricle must pump blood to both lungs, as it would normally, and to the rest of the body as well, a situation that can't be kept up for long without intervention.

While infants treated for HLHS usually survive, they often experience chronic health problems for the rest of their lives. Eventually, they will need to have a heart transplant. 

Usually a goalie for his local youth team, Sam got the chance to take part in all the team's regular drills, including one-on-one rushes against Sharks own goalkeeper Alex Stalock.

He even managed to score by flicking the puck between the pro-keeper's legs - a thrilling moment captured on camera and posted to the Sharks' Instagram page, along with close to a score of other photos of Sam's day.

But the climax came when he donned a No. 20 shirt and skated onto the ice with his new teammates through their trademark shark's head tunnel to line up with them before their league game against the Florida Panthers.

It was the first time in the history of the San Jose Sharks that anyone other than an active player had joined the team on the ice for the singing of the national anthem.

Sam's special day was made possible with the help of the Make-A-Wish Foundation working alongside the Sharks Foundation. 

San Jose coach Todd McLellan said: 'The Make-A-Wish Foundation does another tremendous thing for people that need it. We're happy to participate in that. We're glad that we can be part of his day.'
