A little brown bear who injured her paws in a fire is being nursed back to health after being found in a driveway in Washington state.

Steve Love who lives in Methow Valley heard his dog barking and even his horse was acting up, so he went to see what all the commotion was about.

He spotted a helpless bear cub hobbling in his driveway. The six-month-old had been injured in a fire and severely burnt her paws.

The care she needs: The 37-pound baby bear, nicknamed "Cinder," was in agony, with third-degree burns on all four paws and badly scorched sections of her ears, face and body

Mr Love approached the bear to help it but was scared off by the menacing growling she was making.

Eventually he threw pieces of fruit at the furry animal and even managed to give her some water.

'Later in the evening, she was lying down making pitiful whimpering noises,' Mr Love told KOMO.

'I got about six feet away, sat down and talked to it in a soothing way, telling it things would be okay. It seemed to make it feel better. It stopped making the noises.'

Fish and Wildlife responded to the call and eventually captured the 35lb female.

The little bear tried to escape when the officer used his catch pole but was unable due to her injuries.

Her paws were scorched from walking across the burnt landscape of coals and hot ash and she had tried to alleviate the pain by crawling on her elbows.

The blaze in the Methow Valley in north-central Washington is the largest wildfire in the state's history.

It
 has burned more than 250,000 acres and destroyed 300 homes, kiling one 
person and countless animals.

Bearing up? The cub had limped up a driveway and then took shelter under a horse trailer

The cub was then transferred to Wenatchee, Washington, where state biologist Rich Beausoleil became responsible for her welfare. She was aptly named, Cinder.

'All four paws were third degree burns. She has some burns to her face and arms and chest. Those were relatively minor and I think that will grow back. It's the four feet we're worried about,' Mr Beausoleil said.

He gave the bear,some yogurt and dog food.

Looking for a more permanent home for the brown bear he decide to take her to Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care, a place that helps burned bear cubs rehabilitate.

Pilot Bill Inman of Seattle transported the cub in his small, private airplane.

'She is eating and drinking very normally and that's a great sign so we're optimistic that she'll make a recovery,' Mr Beausoleil said.

What's in a name? The 6-month-old bear cub was named Cinder
