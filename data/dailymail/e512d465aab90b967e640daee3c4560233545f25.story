This is the hilarious moment a clumsy panda cub took a tumble whilst trying to ride a rocking horse.

After looking a little nervous climbing on to the horse, the brave bear soon got the hang of the children's plaything and was rocking back forth at Bifengxia Panda Reserve in Chengdu, China within minutes.

But his confidence appeared to have got the better of him when, after leaning too far forward, he accidentally tipped the toy over and ended up in a heap on the floor.

Hilarious: After taking his time nervously climbing on to the rocking horse, the adorable panda cub quickly grew overconfident. Minutes later he tumbled off the toy while leaning too far forward

Clumsy: The panda cub shifted too much weight to the front of the rocking horse and overbalanced. He thought little of his fall however, and was back on the horse in no time

The hilarious incident took place at the Panda Kindergarten enclosure at the Bifengxia Panda Reserve and was caught on camera by Irish photographer, David Jenkins, 41, who was volunteering at the centre.

Despite looking a little bamboozled by his ordeal, the baby panda wasn't at all injured and quickly tried to climb on to the horse for a second ride.

Mr Jenkins said: 'This particular panda was having a lot of fun exploring and climbing that day, as soon as the keepers brought the rocking horse into the enclosure, it made a beeline straight for it.'

Cute: After a shaky start, the adorable panda cub spent several minutes rocking back and forth on the horse before taking a tumble. He was left slightly confused, but totally unhurt by his ordeal

Enjoying the ride: The incident took place at a special 'panda kindergarden' at the Bifengxia Panda Reserve in Chengdu, China. Irish photographer, David Jenkins, 41, was volunteering at the centre at the time

Getting back in the saddle: Despite looking a little bamboozled by his ordeal, the baby panda wasn't at all injured and quickly climbed back on to the horse for a second ride

'The horse was really popular with the panda cubs, every time I went to the Panda Kindergarten enclosure there was always at least one cub trying it out,' he said.

He added: 'I was lucky enough to catch the pandas in an active spell as they spend a lot of their time in very deep sleep, that is until they awake and go looking for mischief again.'

Mr Jenkins went on: 'It was very funny but I did worry it might have hurt itself, but the panda was fine, it jumped up straight away and once again tried to hop back on the horse.'
