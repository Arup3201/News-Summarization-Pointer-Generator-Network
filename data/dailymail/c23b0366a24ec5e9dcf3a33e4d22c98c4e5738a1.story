Manny Pacquiao is into his second week of training ahead of his huge fight against Floyd Mayweather, and the Filipino fighter has been stepping up the intensity of his preparations.

The 36-year-old was surrounded by fans with cameras on the streets of Hollywood on Tuesday and could be seen throwing quick-fire punches at an invisible opponent with a strained look on his face.

Mayweather and Pacquiao come face-to-face in their only press conference before the mega-fight on Wednesday.

Pacquiao has been seen out on the streets of late and this latest showing in front of a group of fans continued his latest round of 'road work out training'. 

The Filipino  posted a video of the session on Instagram with the caption: 'Day 8 of my road work out training, to God be all the Glory thank you Lord.' 

Pacquiao confirmed on Monday that he was '100 per cent confident' of overcoming unbeaten Mayweather on May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, although the Pacman is taking no chances judging by the impressive intensity of his work-out videos.

He is currently going through the conditioning stage of his preparations but soon his sparring partners will aim to mimic Mayweather's style as the clock counts down on the fight expected to break pay-per-view television records.

And Pacquiao says his position as underdog is helping him in the work-out sessions.

'It's a good thing to be an underdog,' Pacquiao told the LA Times. 'It helps me a lot. You're more focused on training. I feel like I'm at the start again. I've always been an underdog.'
