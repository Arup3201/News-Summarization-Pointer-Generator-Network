A daredevil slackliner tiptoed across a tiny railing and juggled above a 30 metre drop in an awe-inspiring stunt.

Flaviu Cernescu, climbed up and walked across a 4cm wide aqueduct support in Resita, Romania - with no safety equipment to prevent him from falling.

The 32-year-old then continued his crossing while juggling three balls as the rail swayed under his feet.

Flaviu Cernescu did the death-defying stunt while juggling three balls as the rail swayed under his feet

The dizzying feat is the latest escapade of the extreme sportsman, who hails from Caras-Severin, Romania.

Flaviu said: 'I passed the pipe every day and I always wanted to walk across it.

'I don't get scared - walking at that height just feels natural to me.

'The walking was difficult because it swayed as I moved across it, I had to concentrate at every step.

'When I started juggling it got a lot harder, the rail was moving underneath me and I knew that if I made one mistake I would fall.'
