A former employee of an aquatic animal park has given a damning account of the horrific conditions animals were forced to endure.

Phil Demers resigned from Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario in May after 12 years as a senior trainer.

He said a major reason for his departure was because the poor water conditions at the park had a catastrophic effect on the health of the seals, sea lions, walruses and dolphins.

Horrifying: 'The water had gotten so bad it was green, it was harming the animals, it smelled bad and it made the people who worked in this environment ill as well,' said Mr Demers

'The water had gotten so bad it was green, it was harming the animals, it smelled bad and it made the people who worked in this environment ill as well,' he told the Toronto Star.

'The chemicals we were using to try to maintain the water were really harming the animals.'

In revelations that have outraged animal right's activists he said the he saw the dolphin's skin was flaking off, and that they could not open their eyes.

Damage: 'The chemicals we were using to try to maintain the water were really harming the animals,' said Mr Demers

Disturbing:The former trainer described a pattern of neglect that has repeatedly resulted in animal suffering

Recalling the condition of Seal Lions Baker 
and Sander, he said that they could not even train them to open their 
eyes as 'the damage was so extensive that when we finally saw it, it was
 just grotesque.'

He told how the trainers would pull 
the animals out of the water to dry conditions to try and alleviate the 
damage but said as a consequence not having access to 
fresh water also proved to be harmful for the animals.

'Baker was writhing in pain, constantly shaking erratically, clutching his eyes shut,' he said.

He
 explained that Sandy did not move for weeks on end and to try and gain a
 monetary respite from the agony, Baker would constantly put his head 
into a bucket of fresh water.

Mr Demers told how he eventually removed Baker from the dry environment, because he was concerned about his health.

'He
 actually barked and his eyeball lens had projected from his eye socket 
an landed on the floor, streams of blood was coming from his eye.'

Talking about Baker and Sander he said that they could not even train them to open their eyes: 'the damage was so extensive that when we finally saw it, it was just grotesque'

He said that now Baker swims in circles repeatedly, 'with no real agenda.' 

Mr
 Demers' disturbing claims have been backed up by seven other former Marineland 
staffers who also gave disturbing accounts to the newspaper.

Since the interview was published by the Toronto Star, many people have demanded for the closure of the privately owned facility which charges adult visitors $48.53 a ticket and children $35.95. 

Zoocheck Canada has called on the federal and provincial governments to step in and shut down Marineland.

'We’ve
 been monitoring MarineLand for some 25 years and bringing these issues 
to various government agencies and there has been no political will to 
deal with it.  We’ve raised the issue numerous times via the media.'

'We’ve attempted to get a ban on the 
import and export of wild-cetaceans and trade within Canada because we 
knew this situation has been ongoing for the longest time,' said Julie 
Woodyer, Campaigns Director for Zoocheck Canada to Newstalk 1010.

John Holer, owner of the Niagara institution for 51 years, told the newspaper that there was not an issue with water quality at the park.

He said there were a sufficient number of staff to look after the animals, that all the facilities were legal and denied that unhealthy water has harmed marine mammals.

It was only last year that the aquarium was the centre of controversy when it entered into a custody battle with SeaWorld Parks.

The dispute was over the return of SeaWorld’s breeding male orca, Ikaika, loaned from Orlando.

SeaWorld officials raised concerns about the number of staff and training. staffing numbers and training.

They also claimed Holer did not allow trainers to attend workshops to update their skills.

The case was ultimately decided by leasing legalities.
