Authorities in Syria admit they have only removed less than half of their stockpile of chemical weapons, meaning they risk missing the crucial June 30 deadline for them all to be destroyed.

Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, agreed to give up the 
weapons last year in a deal with Russia and the United States, 
but the operation is several months behind schedule.

Two
 cargoes of the weapons were loaded onto vessels in the Mediterranean 
over the past week, meaning half have now been shipped out of the 
country, the international team overseeing the disarmament process said.

With the country locked in a bitter civil war that has been raging now for three years, authorities
blame security problems for the delays in bringing the chemicals to the 
Mediterranean port Latakia.

They have asked to be given until April 27 
to complete the removal of the consignment, which would put the mission 
two-and-a-half months behind schedule.

Five rockets were fired towards the 
Latakia port area earlier this month, with one landing near to where the
 international chemical team were staying, sources said on Tuesday.

The
 joint mission of the United Nations and the Organisation for the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said in a statement late on Wednesday 
that 45.6 percent of the chemicals had been removed from Syria's Latakia
 port for destruction outside the country.

The
 joint UN-OPCW mission said the delivery of the latest two consignments 
to vessels off Latakia means that 29.5 percent of the 'Priority 1' 
chemicals, considered the most dangerous, have been removed and 82.6 
percent of 'Priority 2' chemicals.

Today Syrian troops closed a border 
crossing with Lebanon amid heavy clashes with rebels in the area that 
activists said killed 12 people.

The
 fighting forced dozens of wounded to pour across the volatile boundary 
to seek help on the Lebanese side, officials and activists said.

The fighting on the Syrian 
side was so intense that stray bullets and rockets landed on the 
Lebanese side, in the region of Wadi Khaled, according to Lebanon's 
state-run National News Agency.

A Lebanese man in Wadi Khaled was wounded and rushed to a nearby hospital, the report said.

The
 NNA said Syrian government forces closed the Bqaiaa crossing because of
 the fighting earlier on Thursday. Some stray bullets hit a Lebanese 
army checkpoint and two homes caught fire and burned in Lebanon, the 
report also said.

The 
Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fighting 
concentrated in and around the Syrian village of al-Hosn, where 12 
people were killed on Thursday.

The Observatory's chief, Rami Abdurrahman, said it was not clear if those killed were civilians or rebel fighters.

Syria's
 news agency SANA said 'a number of terrorists were killed' as they 
tried to flee from al-Hosn toward Lebanon. Syrian authorities refer to 
opposition fighters as terrorists.

George Kittaneh, head of Lebanese Red 
Cross operations, told Lebanon's LBC television that about 45 wounded 
people were brought across the border into Lebanon for treatment.

Syrian
 troops backed by fighters from Lebanon's Hezbollah group have been on 
the offensive over the past months in areas close to the Lebanese 
border, aiming to cut rebel supply lines across the porous boundary.

Another
 Wadi Khaled resident, Ahmad al-Fahel, told The Associated Press over 
the telephone that schools were closed in areas close to the border and 
that some residents fled their homes to safer areas.

"People are terrified and many stayed in their homes," said al-Fahel, who owns a tanker truck that supplies residents with water from a spring near the border. "I haven't worked for two days."

Residents in some parts of northern Lebanon closed roads in protest of the shelling from Syria, NNA said.

Lebanon has been on edge since the central Syrian town of Yabroud was taken by President Bashar Assad's troops last Sunday.

Sectarian violence between Lebanon's Sunnis and Shiites linked to Syria's civil war has left scores of people dead in recent months.

In a spill-over from the conflict next door, pro- and anti-Syrian gunmen clashed overnight in the northern Libyan city of Tripoli. Fighting there has been ongoing since last week, with occasional lulls.

Also Thursday, Syrian state TV 
reported that troops discovered a makeshift rebel bomb-making factory 
used to rig cars with explosives in the border village of Ras Al-Ayn.

The
 village was captured on Wednesday by Syrian forces and Syrian state TV 
footage from the area showed what it said were vehicles with Lebanese 
plates that were meant to be sent to Lebanon for attacks.

About a dozen car bombs have gone off over the past months in Lebanon, killing dozens of people.

Hezbollah,
 the Shiite militant group in Lebanon that has been fighting on Assad's 
side in Syria's civil war, has said the vehicles were rigged with 
explosives inside Syria and subsequently sent to Lebanon.
