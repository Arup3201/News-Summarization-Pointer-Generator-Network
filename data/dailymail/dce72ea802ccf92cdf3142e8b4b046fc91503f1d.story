An aspiring model says the overwhelming support she received from her Facebook friends is the secret behind her cancer recovery.

Caris Hedd-Bowen, who has 2,127 friends on the social networking website, was told she had Hodgkin’s lymphoma in January after doctors spotted a lump on her chest.

Within days of being diagnosed, she began a gruelling chemotherapy regime in an attempt to tackle the cancer.

Caris Hedd-Bowen, 22, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in January when she was just 21. She turned to her 2,127 Facebook friends for support

Ms Hedd-Bowen said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. I was only 21 and my head filled with a thousand thoughts, including the faces of my two sons Travis and Finley, when I was diagnosed.

‘It was heart-breaking to think I may not be around to watch my boys grow up. I knew I had to get on with it and beat it.’

As a way of dealing with the stress, Ms Hedd-Bowen, now 22, shared her fight with contacts on Facebook, and was amazed by the feedback she received.

She said: ‘Within minutes, people - people I didn’t even know - were messaging me with supportive comments, saying I looked beautiful, and willing me to keep fighting.

‘It was amazing, and more than once the response of people on Facebook had me in tears. I couldn’t believe how kind everyone was, even complete strangers.

‘I have amazing family and friends, but there were times I felt terribly alone during my treatment. I had to spend time away from my sons and of course I felt ill a lot of the time during my chemotherapy.

She was given the all-clear earlier this month after a CT scan showed she was cancer free. She shared the news with her Facebook friends by posting this picture of herself on a beach

Ms Hedd-Bowen says that when she was diagnosed her first thought was that she might not live to see her sons, Travis, seven, and Finley, five, grow up

‘Facebook has helped me in ways I can’t describe. Whenever I felt low, I would post a picture of me wearing a variety of different wigs, or bald pictures to show how I was losing my hair. The response was incredible.’

Ms Hedd-Bowen, who hopes to model full-time, knew which kind of photographs her followers would find most interesting.

She said: ‘Soon, Facebook became my crutch. I would post pictures of me in hospital, I would update people on my progress, and I made sure I was 100 per cent honest about how I was feeling and coping with it all.

Ms Hedd-Bowen said: 'It was heart-breaking to think I may not be around to watch my boys grow up. I knew I had to get on with it and beat it'

‘Every chemotherapy day I would get dolled up and take a photo as I was plugged in to the machine, smiling and happy as ever because I was grateful to be alive.

‘People never let me down - lovely comforting comments were streaming in, as well as hundreds of likes on my posts and pictures.

‘It was such an amazing lift to read things like that while I was feeling ill and emotional. It gave me a daily boost and reminded me to keep fighting.’

In June Ms Hedd-Bowen, of Pembrey, South Wales, was told the news she was in remission.

She announced this to her army of friends through a series of status updates.

Ms Hedd-Bowen says that the responses and messages she received on Facebook were so overwhelmingly kind that they often left her in tears

She wrote: ‘Guess what? I have well and truly kicked cancer’s ass! I am cancer free!’

She also posted a photograph of her lying on the beach with the words ‘I beat cancer’.

This month she told her friends: ‘Just received a letter from the hospital saying my CT scan that I had two weeks ago has come back totally clear. It’s definitely 100 per cent gone! Yay!’

Responses included messages of congratulations and a torrent of smiley faces.

She said: ‘Grateful doesn’t begin to cover how I felt. I took a few minutes to phone my family and a few of my friends, and then I declared my fight was over on Facebook.

Ms Hedd-Bowen says that Facebook became her 'crutch' as it gave her the daily boost she needed to keep fighting. She says she is extremely grateful for all of the support she received

‘My status got more than 600 likes, which was amazing.

‘I had a final CT scan and two more chemotherapy sessions, and then I was free to get on with my life.

‘One thing I have learnt from battling cancer so publicly is how incredibly caring people are. I have also met so many people suffering cancer and all other types of illnesses through Facebook, I have been there for them and they have been there for me.’

She now is busy planning her future with her sons Travis, 7, and Finley, 5.

Ms Hedd-Bowen says that she got dressed up every day, even when she was having chemotherapy, and posted a picture of herself in hospital

‘I have a million plans,’ she said.

‘I am going to raise as much as I can for cancer charities and I plan to start back at college to complete an interior design course.

‘I want to fall in love, I want to travel - everything which life brings.

‘I am so grateful to still be here with my two boys and if anything ever happens to me again, I know I have an army of supporters on Facebook.’

Hodgkin's lymphoma is cancer of the B lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell found in the lymphatic system.

Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

In lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply abnormally and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes.

The most common symptom is a painless swelling in a gland, most commonly in the neck, armpit or groin.

The cancer is most common in 15 to 35-year-olds and the over 50s. More men than women are affected.

Nearly 1,500 people in the UK are diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma every year.

It is one of the most easily treatable forms of cancer - almost all young people with Hodgkin's lymphoma will be cured. For older people, the cure rate is about 80 per cent.
