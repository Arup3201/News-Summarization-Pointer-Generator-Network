James Ward was unable to extend his winning run at the French Open despite a hugely creditable performance against 17th seed Tommy Robredo.

The Londoner took the first set in pouring rain on Court 6 but Robredo hit back to win 4-6 6-4 6-2 6-4.

Ward became the first British man to qualify at Roland Garros for 41 years when he beat Blaz Rola in the final qualifying round on Friday but the draw was not kind. Spaniard Robredo, a former top-10 player, is a man of significant clay-court pedigree and a quarter-finalist here last year, when he came back from two sets down to win three successive matches.

Going home: James Ward took the first set but was eventually undone by Tommy Robredo

Although he has not been in great form this season, his movement and remarkable defensive skills are tailor-made for clay.

Ward, who spent part of his junior days training in Spain, is also happy on the dirt and has pulled off some impressive wins, not least beating American Sam Querrey in Davis Cup in February.

It was Robredo who made the better start in steady drizzle, breaking the Ward serve in the third game, but back came the British number three to level at 3-3. He then saved a break point to hold for 5-4, his serve getting him out of trouble, and piled the pressure on Robredo as the rain became ever heavier.

Steady: The Spaniard showed his class to pull away from Ward and claim his place in the second round

Soon it was teeming down but on they went. Robredo saved three set points but not a fourth, Ward taking it with a forehand winner and a pump of the fist.

On Friday, his good friend Andy Murray touted Ward as a potential top-50 player, describing his cross-court backhand, which was much in evidence against Robredo, as 'maybe world class'.

The quality and conviction of his play was hugely impressive but a break for rain did not seem to help him as on the resumption a series of loose points saw him drop his serve to start the second set.

He continued to put pressure on Robredo and took his chance in the eighth game to level at 4-4 when the Spaniard missed a backhand only to drop his serve again straight away.

Achievement: Ward was the first British man in 41 years to come through the qualifying rounds

In rain reminiscent of the end of the opener, Robredo served out the set, and the pair stayed in their chairs while the worst of the weather passed. Ward did not seem happy about starting again and, like in the second set, he dropped his serve straight away.

When Robredo held from 0-40 in the next game, Ward began to look a little weary, and the third set quickly slipped away. He renewed his efforts at the start of the fourth but must have felt like he was playing a wall as Robredo retrieved everything.

The Spaniard broke Ward's serve for the sixth time in the match to move 3-2 ahead and clinched victory after two hours and 53 minutes. It was not without some final heroics from Ward, though, who saved two match points in fine style on his own serve.

The 27-year-old demonstrated once again that he performs at his best on the big stage and he will have high hopes for the grass-court season.
