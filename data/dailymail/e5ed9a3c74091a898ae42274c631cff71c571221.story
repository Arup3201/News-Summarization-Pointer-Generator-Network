A 27-year-old son received no money and a charge for home invasion after failed attempt to rob his mother at knifepoint.

Austin Smith, of Pekin, Illinois, had nine knives and wore a mask in his attempt to steal the woman's credit cards and cash, but he did not leave the house with anything.

The would-be robber, who tried but failed to tie his mother up to prevent her from calling the police, was arrested 90 minutes after the attempted theft around 12.45pm Friday afternoon.

Austin Smith, 27, of Pekin, Illinois, was charged with home invasion after allegedly breaking into his mother's house and holding her at gunpoint but failing to get any money

It is assumed the mother recognized her son despite his mask, Pekin Police's Mike Eeten told the Pekin Daily Times.

Smith's mother had told him not to come by the house. 

The son did not live at the address where he is thought to have broken a rear window and was arrested at a apartment complex about a mile away.

He had been released on bond for a residential burglary two weeks ago before the latest incident.

Smith has been charged with home invasion and is being held pending a bond hearing.

The suspect has two misdemeanor theft convictions from 2012 as well as 28 traffic violations in the past 12 years. 

The type of mask Smith wore was not made known.

Pekin has an estimated population of 34,000. 

The mother refused to be tied up and her attacker fled. The son did not live at her house (pictured) and was discovered in another part of the town, which has a population of 34,000.
