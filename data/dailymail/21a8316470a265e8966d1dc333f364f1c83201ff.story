The BBC is no longer the 'bastion' of correct English on radio and television, one of its editors has admitted.

Thousands of viewers and listeners now complain to the corporation every year saying its once-high standards of grammar and pronunciation have slipped.

Ian Jolly, who is the BBC newsroom's 'style editor', conceded his presenters and reporters repeatedly make basic errors, such as confusing the word 'historic' with 'historical' and using the term 'chair' when they mean 'chairman' or 'chairwoman'.

Following recent criticisms that presenters are also mispronouncing the letter 'H', he called on the BBC's senior management to prioritise efforts to make the corporation a linguistic 'standard bearer' once more.

Appearing on Radio 4's Feedback, he said: 'There are thousands of people who get in touch with us every year because of our output on radio and television and on the internet. So they do care.

'And the thing that people often point out is that they look to the BBC to uphold standards. So I do think that we used to be a standard bearer in these matters.

'Whether that’s the case now I’m not so sure. I would love to see someone at the top of the BBC take up the challenge and put the emphasis back on the quality of our language so we can once again be a leader for the people who look to us.

'They think the BBC is the bastion and I would like to see us back at that position.'

Mr Jolly was asked to respond to a string of complaints received in the past week by Feedback.

One listener, Stuart Grist, contacted the programme to complain about BBC reports into the resignations of Fiona Woolf and Baroness Butler-Sloss from the Government's sex abuse inquiry.

He said: 'The other day it was reported that the child abuse enquiry had lost two chairs. Today we were told that two chairs had stepped down. Whatever next, "chairs found legless"? Or worse, "two chairs table motions"?'

Mr Jolly agreed it was incorrect to describe somebody as a 'chair' rather than a 'chairman' or 'chairwoman'. He added: 'I think it’s one of the side effects of what we like to call political correctness. But I don’t really see the need for it and we don’t advocate using it. We think if a man’s a chairman, he’s a chairman. A woman’s a chairwoman.

'If you know the gender of a person then there are quite good options there.'

Another listener complained about the repeated confusion of the word 'historic', which should be used to describe an important event, and 'historical', which simply means an event took place in the past.

He said newspapers, police forces and even the judiciary have also made the same error, adding: 'So it is one of those phrases that has seeped into our consciousness. We never used to use it and now we are not sure which it should be and tend to get it wrong. '

Mr Jolly said he 'occasionally' tells off presenters for making grammatical mistakes, but said listeners and viewers should be more understanding of errors that creep into live broadcasts.

He said: 'The BBC produces hundreds of hours of broadcasting every day, much of it live. Not every word is perfect. We would be concerned if writers were getting things wrong.

'I think we have to allow staff a little bit of leeway in the live broadcasting that makes up so much of our output.'

Last month, the BBC was criticised by the Queen's English Society for allowing presenters including Sara Cox and Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw to say 'haitch' instead of 'aitch' when referring to the letter 'H'.

It said such mistakes marked the beginning of a 'slippery slope', but the BBC said it was proud of the 'range of voices' across its programmes.
