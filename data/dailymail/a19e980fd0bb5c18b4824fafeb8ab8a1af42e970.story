First Great Western Trains were braced for travel chaos after the final whistle. With the game finishing at 9.56pm, supporters had just 30 minutes to make the one and only train, which departed at 10.26pm. 

With more than 10,000 supporters expected to be rushing back to London Paddington, the advice from an official steward was ‘run!’ Anyone unlucky enough to miss the final service faced hotel charges upwards of £400.

Tickets were few and far between, although Sportsmail was offered a pair for £400 by a profiteering tout shortly before kick-off. They had a face value of £80 each and had originally been allocated to local rugby club, Newport RFC. 

Policemen were within 10metres of the touts, however they seemed to have no problem with the black-market dealing. Viagogo, the major resale website, were charging up to £750 a pair.

Radio One’s DJ Spoony came up with the set-list to accompany the dazzling pre-match light show. Coincidently, the music celebrity shares the same name as England centre Jonathan Joseph. 

His tunes were followed up by a rousing anthem performance by the Band of the Welsh Guard, who found themselves lost in the concourse before their rehearsal! Meanwhile, the Male Voice Choir revved up the parochial crowd from pitchside.

Catering staff were kept busy with chefs preparing 9,000 hot dogs (£3.70 each), 4,000 pies (£3.50 each) and 2,000 hospitality meals for hungry supporters. Upwards of 60,000 pints of beer were expected to be sold, with prices ranging between £4 and £4.70. 

An additional 2,000 members of staff were brought in to meet the demand; including 900 waiters, waitresses and bar staff, 770 security stewards and 35 chefs across 10 kitchens.

Former England international Victor Ubogu was left looking for someone to watch the game with after his guest dropped out at the last minute. 

The retired Bath prop said on Twitter: ‘Client can't attend. Two tickets for Wales v England plus day return on the luxury Northern Belle from Paddington + hospitality. 

Opening the roof of Millennium Stadium will add an extra £2.54 to the Welsh Rugby Union’s annual electricity bill. It takes 20 minutes for the 400 tonne panels to retract, using 3.2km of tensioning cables. 

Warren Gatland lost his battle to have the roof closed and made his frustrations known in his pre-match television interviews, saying: 'It's our stadium. We shouldn't be dictated to by the opposition.'
