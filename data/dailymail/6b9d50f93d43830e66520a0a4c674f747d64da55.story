A Spanish politician has been busted staring at pictures of naked women when he should have been focusing on a political debate.

Miguel Angel Revilla, former President of the Autonomous Community of Cantabria, was photographed ogling over a guitar-playing beauty during a regional parliamentary session on Monday.

The 71-year-old was snapped by photographer Andres Fernandez from the local El diario Monta√±es newspaper.

Damning evidence: Miguel Angel Revilla was caught looking at a naked woman in a magazine he appears to be hiding inside an official folder during a regional parliamentary session

He appears to be covering up his copy of the magazine Interviu, which often features scantily-clad models, with official binders.

The picture was uploaded to Twitter and soon went viral, with many slamming the politician for perving while earning public money.

Red-faced Revilla, however, has played down the incident.

The Regionalist Party of Cantabria leader claimed he was simply flicking through the pages to find a specific article about the fate of former Caja Madrid bank President Miguel Blesa.

'Very interesting article in Interviu about Blesa, I'm sure they caught me reading it,' he tweeted soon after he began trending on the micro-blogging site.

'I asked for Interviu in the session to read the report on Blesa and "wow", the picture is national news,' he added.
