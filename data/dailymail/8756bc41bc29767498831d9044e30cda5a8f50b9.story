Miss Oregon Gabrielle Neilan appeared to be giving her fellow Miss USA contestants some tough competition in the Miss USA preliminaries this week.

But beneath the glamor, the 22-year-old has been fighting a second, more serious battle over the past several months, with thyroid cancer.

Speaking about her initial symptoms last 
October and subsequent treatment, she told People: 'I woke up with a 
lump on my throat.

Survivor: Miss Oregon USA 2013, Gabrielle Neilan, has opened up about her battle with thyroid cancer, now finally in remission

'It hurt so bad. It 
felt like I was swallowing an apple every time I was swallowing.'

When a doctor diagnosed cancer in her thyroid, a gland on the neck, Miss Neilan underwent two urgent surgeries to have it removed - the second just two weeks before the Miss Oregon pageant.

She made a fast enough recovery to compete in the state pageant, and indeed win it - no mean feat. But her treatment was not over, as she then completed a grueling course of radiation in January.

'It's
 been rough, honestly, the whole journey getting here. . .' she admits.

'It's been up and down but I'm finding the positive at the end
 of the day.'

'My strength': The only indication that Miss Neilan has had any medical issue at all is a small scar on her neck

In fact, she says, the experience has given her a sense of perspective, and has taught her not to sweat life's small stuff.

'It's
 been rough, honestly, the whole journey getting here. . . It's been up and down but I'm finding the positive at the end
 of the day'

'It's hard because you go through 
something like that and then you think of the little things in life and 
you realize they're not really that big a deal,' she explains.

Two weeks ago, Miss Neilan finally received the news she had been waiting for: that her cancer was in remission.

With the Miss USA pageant finals taking place in Las Vegas this weekend, she says 'the timing is perfect.'

For viewers watching Sunday night's 
live broadcast on NBC, the only indication that Miss Neilan has had any 
medical issue at all is a small scar on her neck.

Rather than masking it, she is - humorously - baring it with pride.

'It's my strength,' she tells People. 'You can hardly notice it. It's like a fat roll on my neck.'
