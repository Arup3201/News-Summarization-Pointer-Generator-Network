A Uruguayan father who went missing in the Andes four months ago has been found alive after spending a brutal winter eating rats and raisins to survive.

Raul Fernando Gomez Circunegui, 58, was rescued on Sunday after a group of Argentinians who were recording snow levels stumbled across him.

He lost more than three stone during the ordeal and was extremely malnourished, but doctors said he would be 'back to normal' in the next few days.

He set out to cross the mountains from 
Chile to Argentina in May but had to take the journey on by foot because
 his motorcycle broke down.

He then lost his way during a snowstorm.

A search party had been launched to try and find Gomez, but it was abandoned in July because of harsh conditions.

Officials from the northwestern province of San Juan then found Gomez in a shelter 9,318 feet above sea level.

A desperate and feeble Gomez managed to alert the crew by hobbling over and opening the shelter's door.

San
 Juan Governor Jose Luis Gioja told the local Diario de Cuyo newspaper: 
'The truth is that this is a miracle. We still can't believe it.

'We let him talk to his wife, his mother and his daughter.

'I asked him, "Are you a believer?" He told me, "no, but now I am".

Sugar, raisins, rats and the shelter's leftover supplies kept Gomez alive through the Southern Hemisphere's winter.

He lost 44 pounds during the ordeal and is dehydrated, according to media reports.

A doctor who examined Gomez was surprised by the man's resilience, according to Uruguayan newspaper El Pais.

The doctor treating him said: 'He's a patient with high blood pressure, a history of smoking and signs of undernourishment.

'But he's going to be fine and in a few days we're going to discharge him.'

The story brings back memories of 1972, when a plane carrying an Uruguayan rugby team to Chile crashed into a remote section of the Andes.

The crash left 29 people dead but 16 survivors manage to sustain themselves by eating dead bodies.
