Axed: Kevin Pietersen was dropped by England following the Ashes series debacle

But Monday's 95-run defeat at Lord's extended England's winless streak to 10 Test matches and sparked fresh calls for out-of-form Alastair Cook to be dropped and stripped of the captaincy, opening the door on a possible return for the 34-year-old.

And Pietersen admited he had unfinished business on the international stage.

The 34-year-old told BT Sport: 'I'd love to play for England again but we might to have for a few things to change before that could possibly happen.

'Over
 the next 12 months there's an opportunity to win a World Cup in 
Australia and to get the Ashes back. To pick up a trophy with the England 
team would be sensational and to avenge what has happened over the past 12 months would be what dreams are made of.

'What I know i could bring to that England team is helping those youngsters play a brand of cricket which would develop their games .

'Having a player in the middle order that plays a positive brand of cricket, helps a lot of the players around him too.

'You look at (Ian) Bell, who's struggling at the moment. I know how Rooty (Joe Root) feels about his batting and he's going to be a superstar. I worked with him for a while and it would be nice to continue that work.

'I always gave 100 per cent to the England team in training and on the cricket field and who knows, maybe in the dressing room I could have helped a few of the others play differently.'
