Blackpool’s attempts to replace Jose Riga as manager have hit a stumbling block after talks with Owen Coyle slowed down in the past 24 hours.

The relationship between Riga and chairman Karl Oyston has broken down over transfer policy and what the manager perceives to be a series of false promises emanating from the boardroom. 

Oyston is livid that after six successive defeats to start the campaign, Riga returned to his native Belgium last week - Sportsmail understands the Belgian was on a scheduled family break that had been agreed with the club - rather than focus on improving the fitness of a squad which played just two pre-season games over the summer.

The chairman decided to bring an end to Riga’s reign this weekend but the Belgian was not informed over the club’s intentions and took training on Monday and Tuesday after returning to England.

Coyle, who is understood to have previously rejected the Blackpool job twice before, was in line to take the job.

However, it is believed that an agent has become involved in the deal and a source close to the club has indicated that Oyston, who traditionally refuses to pay representatives, has now become unhappy.

Coyle, for his part, is believed to have concerns over the working conditions of a club that is in utter disarray. It is thought that he and his assistants have been warned about the situation at the club by previous employees of Oyston.

The deal with Coyle is not dead in the water and could yet be revived as the loveless marriage with Riga appears unsustainable.

In an interview with the Blackpool Gazette on Tuesday, Oyston remained coy on whether Riga would be shown the exit door, but the chairman did stress his fury at the manager's actions over the past week.

'Until I've spoken to Jose personally, I don't want to comment about the speculation or go into it in too much detail,' said Oyston.

'However, I have to say I find myself slightly bemused yet again by the actions of our manager.

'He has said, on many occasions on the record, that he would use the international break to get the players up to fitness and to work with the squad we now have. The first thing the manager does is hop on a plane and clear off to Belgium for a week without telling anyone.

'Let's face it, we've lost every competitive game he's managed and these actions aren't the most professional way to get us out of this position. To hop on a plane without telling your employer or your colleagues isn't right. It's something I will be speaking to him about.'

It is likely that Oyston will have to come to a financial settlement with the manager if he wants him to leave.

Burton’s Gary Rowett is an alternative if Coyle cannot be secured.
