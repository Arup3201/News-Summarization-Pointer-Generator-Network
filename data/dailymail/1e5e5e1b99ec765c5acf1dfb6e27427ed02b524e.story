It appeared to be a harmless spec on the camera lens as news anchor Jonathan Uptin read the evening bulletin on Thursday.

But to some, it was an indicator of something far more sinister.

As the Channel Nine anchor began to read his regular broadcast, a disk shaped, grey, unidentified object appeared above his left shoulder on the backdrop.

The object instantly sparked rumours that the broadcast had captured footage of a UFO sighting.

Despite the spec disappearing after a few moments, Mr Uptin told NT News he feared for his safety.

'I just hope it doesn't return tonight and I'm abducted,' he said.

With his back turned to the scene, Mr Uptin admitted he hadn't originally noticed the dark shape.

However, after being notified by his news director halfway through reading the news, he admitted he tried to take a quick look, but by this point it had disappeared.

'It is a real concern obviously but because I was facing the camera I didn't know what was going on behind me, so I wasn't as petrified as I should have been,' Mr Uptin told NT News.

He then added: 'I thought it was bad when my Melbourne colleague Peter Hitchener was attacked by a seagull but this is obviously a much deeper concern.'

'I survived tonight's broadcast, but have serious reservations if I'll be in the chair on Monday,' Mr Uptin told Daily Mail Australia on Friday night.

He later revealed the mystery behind the smear, saying 'The truth is it was a bug that we couldn't get off the lens of our camera'.
