Firms bidding for government contracts will have to offer higher wages to their lowest-paid staff under Labour plans.

Ed Miliband is expected to announce at Labour’s conference next week that firms seeking government work will have to pay the so-called ‘living wage’, which is more than £1 an hour higher than the national minimum wage.

The move is the centrepiece of a package which will also see significant increases in the minimum wage, and a new formula to prevent it falling behind inflation.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves last night said some employers were already paying the living wage.

She said: ‘I want to use those examples of best practice in the public and private sectors to determine how a future Labour Government would act, and that would mean over time having public sector procurement requiring paying a living wage.

‘That’s something we’re looking at for the manifesto. And it’s something that Ed feels very strongly about.’

The national minimum wage stands at £6.50 an hour. The living wage is significantly higher at £7.65 an hour, up to £8.80 in London.

Senior Labour figures have been trying to drum up business support for a big increase in the minimum wage ahead of next week’s conference in Manchester.

Mr Miliband’s adviser on the issue, Alan Buckle, has launched a discreet bid to persuade business leaders to sign an open letter backing the idea. 

The letter says that ‘as the economy recovers, we believe the minimum wage should rise faster than it has in the recent past. A stronger minimum wage will benefit businesses, improve public finances and help tackle low pay’. 

It makes no mention of a specific figure, but Labour is thought to be considering boosting the minimum wage to £7 an hour.

Miss Reeves told The House magazine: ‘I do think there’s scope for increasing the value of the national minimum wage. I think it’s fallen in real terms by 5 per cent since the last general election. I would like to see at least that value restored.’

Miss Reeves also sought to toughen Labour’s rhetoric on the issue of migrants claiming benefits, saying decisions on benefits should be set by Parliament, not Brussels.

She said: ‘I don’t think it’s right that someone should be able to come to this country and be able to start claiming benefits on day one. Or that they should be able to claim child benefit for children living overseas.’

‘All countries in the European Union have their own welfare states and welfare is supposed to be an issue of national sovereignty, so we should be able to make decisions about how our welfare state works.’

Tory MP Brian Binley, a member of the Commons business select committee, said politicians should be ‘very wary’ of imposing big wage increases on employers.

Mr Binley said: ‘They need to be very careful about this, and think about the impact on jobs. Most small business I know want to pay people the best wage they can because it is the best way to keep good people. But ultimately they can only pay what they can afford.

‘I would also be worried that a move of this kind could make it harder for small firms to win Government contracts at a time when we want more of them involved.’
