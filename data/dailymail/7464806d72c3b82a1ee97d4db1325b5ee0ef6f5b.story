Jockey Sean Quinlan and trainer Fergal O’Brien were penalised by Ludlow stewards on Thursday when they were found guilty of schooling in public with regards to the run of Iora Glas in the opening novices hurdle.

The six-year-old finished fourth, just six lengths behind winner Baths Well but, after hearing evidence from trainer and jockey, the stewards fined O’Brien £3,000 and Quinlan was banned from January 29 to February 11.

Iora Glass was also prevented from running until February 27 after the stewards found the duo in breach of the rules regarding schooling/conditioning a horse on the racecourse.

The south Shropshire stewards also enjoyed a moral victory when trainer David Bridgewater was fined £2,000 after labelling them ‘idiots’ last week.

Bridgewater apologised for the comments he made after 16-year-old amateur rider Jake Launchbury was banned for 21 days. 

He  accepted the British Horseracing Authority fine with remorse on Thursday.
