Labour leader Ed Miliband was today hounded out of an Edinburgh shopping centre as a campaign walkabout became overrun by protesters.

He was repeatedly branded a 'f***ing liar' by Yes campaigners who drowned out his supporters with cries of 'bow down to your imperial master.

Mr Miliband pleaded for a 'civilised' debate with two days of campaigning left before the referendum, before being rushed out of the door by his aides, who were left 'visibly shaken' by the incident.

At one point he became trapped outside a hairdressers called 'Supercuts', leading opponents to chant: 'Vote No for Supercuts, vote No for permanent austerity'.

Mr Miliband had been due to appear at St James Shopping Centre in Edinburgh at 3.15pm, but arrived almost 45 minutes late.

With Yes protesters outside chanting 'we don't need your f***ing union' and 'how many spare bedrooms has the Queen got?', Labour aides decided to stage the event inside the shopping centre.

But he was unable to address the crowd and only managed to speak to members of the public caught in the furore.

As Mr Miliband battled his way through the crowd, Yes protesters called out: 'This is what a political class looks like when it's dying.' 

The visit to Scotland's capital was supposed to be the main event in Mr Miliband's diary.

But the extraordinary spectacle of the Labour leader being rushed into a car park lift came amid growing concern about threats of intimidation aimed at those opposed to independence. 

First Minister Alex Salmond admitted 'there are always idiots in a campaign' but insisted that '99 per cent of people participating in this campaign are behaving impeccably'. 

However, Labour MSP Kezia Dugdale wrote on Twitter after Mr Miliband's Edinburgh visit: 'Campaign room full of visibly shaken and upset folk who were in St James Centre - truly crappy day for democracy.'

As a large crowd pushed him towards the shopping centre exit, Mr Miliband told journalists: ‘I think we have seen in parts of this campaign an ugly side to it from the Yes campaign.

'I think debate should be conducted in a civilised way, I think that’s very, very important, but I understand that passions run high.'

It is difficult to know what Labour aides hoped to get out of Ed Miliband's walkabout in St James Shopping Centre.

But surely it wasn't this.

The Labour leader had been expected on the Royal Mile, but later changed plans to go to the shopping centre for 3.15pm.

Outside a small group of Yes protesters chanted and laughed, mocking Mr Miliband before he'd even arrived.

Almost half an hour later, aides emerged to tell waiting reporters that Mr Miliband would instead be appearing inside the mall.

Camera crews scrambled, reporters began running, dodging between bewildered shoppers.

But Mr Miliband's walkabout had ground to a halt. Surrounded by a pack, with Yes chants winning on volume alone, he grabbed anyone passing by who could not escape the melee.

He had the grace to laugh when asked about intimidation, but this was a terrible spectacle, his plea for 'civilised' debate drawn out by heckles.

The true low point was when he disappeared into the doorway of a hair salon called Supercuts, deep irony at a time when the SNP complains of Westminster cost-cutting. 

Mr Miliband went on: 'What I have enjoyed about this campaign, including today when I get the chance, is meeting people who are genuinely undecided.'

He was also challenged over whether Gordon Brown is now the leader of the No campaign, after taking a more high profile role than both Mr Miliband and Better Together chief Alistair Darling.

But Mr Miliband insisted:'He’s a very important part of this campaign, I think he has done a very good job. All of us are setting out that choice. 

'I think all of us are doing our job in getting through to Labour voters. I think Gordon is playing his role, Johann Lamont is playing her role, Alistair Darling, all of us are setting out that big choice that we face.'

A Labour campaigner, Clare Lally, said on Twitter: 'Upsetting scenes in Edinburgh at an event, I had to link arms with Monica Lennon to protect Johann Lamont and Margaret Curran #disgraceful.'

Scottish nationalists are facing further accusations of bullying and intimidation as the independence debate turns increasingly bitter.

ITV political editor Tom Bradby said covering the referendum campaign had been a 'rather unpleasant experience'.

Writing a blog, he added: 'My first major job as a correspondent was in Ireland in the early nineties and, despite the fact that there was a bitter war going on all round me that took many lives, I experienced virtually no personal hostility at all from anyone. They didn’t lob accusations of bias around every time you asked a question either.'

BBC Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark last night had to issue an on air apology after a live broadcast was interrupted by a heckler.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander was also heckled during a No campaign rally in Glasgow, and most shockingly of all, Respect MP George Galloway claims he was ‘threatened with a bullet’ during the event. 

Ms Wark was presenting Newsnight from an outdoor studio in Dundee when her broadcast was interrupted by someone shouting and swearing.

The interruptions took place throughout the programme, first when the journalist was interviewing actor Brian Cox and later when she was on air with a panel of industry experts.

Ms Wark told viewers: ‘We apologise for the swearing, I’m afraid it’s beyond our control.’ 

Mr Cox, when asked about negative elements of the Yes campaign, told Ms Wark: ‘You get head-bangers, you’ve just had one behind you now.’

After escaping from the shopping centre, Mr Miliband crossed over a pedestrian bridge before disappearing into the lift of a multistorey car park

The BBC has come under fierce criticism from nationalists who accuse the corporation of being biased in its coverage.

Up to 1,000 independence supporters gathered outside the broadcaster’s headquarters in Glasgow on Sunday, with many also calling for BBC political editor Nick Robinson to be sacked - action that was praised by Alex Salmond as 'joyous'. 

Respect MP George Galloway said he was threatened with a 'bullet' at a No rally in Glasgow last night.

Graffiti saying 'Vote Yes or Else?' was daubed on walls in Aberdeen, including on a house on the corner of Osborne Place and Prince Arthur Street

An Edinburgh Yes voter had 'coward' scratched into his front door in an act of vandalism.

Former Defence Secretary John Reid accused the Yes side of using the ‘language of abuse’ towards women who speak up for union, and he alleged that Alex Salmond’s supporters had organised ‘street mobs’ to intimidate No campaigners.

Mr Reid made the comments after Harry Potter author JK Rowling and lingerie boss Michelle Mone were subjected to abuse after expressing support for the No campaign.

No campaign sources have claimed that a Better Together activist in Aberdeen was warned he would feel like a 'Christian missionary in Syria' after a Yes vote.

A nationalist was also reported to have turned to his son in front of unionist activists in Glasgow and said: 'One day, remind me to tell you what Mussolini did to collaborators.'

And an English activist in Glasgow was told to 'get out of my country', while a Spanish woman, who had lived in Scotland for 20 years, was spat on while leaving a No rally and told to go home.
