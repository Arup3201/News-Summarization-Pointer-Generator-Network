He was saved from the womb when he showed no heartbeat and veterinarians battled to save him.

But at seven-weeks-old Asa the snow leopard cub is now healthy and ready to be introduced to visitors.

The baby cub was born at Rosamond Gifford Zoo, Syracuse, New York, on July 9 to mother Zena and father Senge.

His name means 'Hope' in Nepali, a fitting name given his birth story which involved emergency surgery

Veterinarians performed a physical exam on mother Zena, but detected no heartbeat for the cub

His name means ‘Hope’ in Nepali, which is fitting given his birth story.

Asa was born via emergency surgery after Zena was observed by her keepers to be in labour but not progressing.

Because she appeared to be in distress, veterinarians performed a physical exam and ultrasound detected no heartbeat for the cub.

Asa was initially unresponsive when he was born, but veterinarians from Cornell University worked quickly to stimulate and revive him.

The baby snow leopard weighed just 530 grams at birth and currently weighs a healthy six pounds

He weighed 530 grams at birth and currently weighs six pounds.

Because of the uncertainty of Zena's medical condition following the procedure, the decision was made to hand rear the cub.

Rosamond Gifford Zoo Director Ted Fox said the zoo ideally would like to match Asa with another baby snow leopard so they grow up together and are not too acclimated to humans.

He said: 'Snow leopards are part of a Species Survival Plan. With approximately 4,000 to 6,500 snow leopards left in the wild, Asa's birth is critical to the population. 

'Given that there are currently only 144 snow leopards in 60 zoos across the country, we could not be more pleased with this outcome. We successfully hand-reared a male snow leopard in 1997 and are optimistic based on that success.'

County Executive Joanne Mahoney said: 'The animal staff and veterinarians are to be commended for their quick thinking and excellent work in delivering and caring for Asa.'

He is the sixth snow leopard born at the Syracuse zoo.

There are four males and one female. In addition to Senge and Asa, the zoo is home to males Bajen and Ramil, born in 2012.

Snow leopards cannot roar, so they have to make do with hissing, growling and wailing to communicate

Asa is now the sixth snow leopard to be born at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo, Syracuse, New York

There are currently only 144 snow leopards in 60 zoos across America, so Asa was crucial to the population

The snow leopard is a large cat native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. 

It is a solitary animal except when a mother is nursing cubs and is usually active at dawn and dusk.

It is the National Heritage Animal of Pakistan. It is an endangered species with around 6,500 animals worldwide.

The animal weighs around eight stone with some males running to 12 stone.

The body is rather short measuring around 4feet in length although the tail can add another three feet.

Oddly, the snow leopard cannot roar and has to make do with hissing, growling and wailing. 

Its main diet is sheep but they can kill prey up to three times its own weight and must hunt a large animal about once every fortnight to survive.
