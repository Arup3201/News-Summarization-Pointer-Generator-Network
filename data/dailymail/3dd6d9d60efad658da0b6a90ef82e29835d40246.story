Even in the animal kingdom unruly offspring have to be told off - and this leopard taught her cub a lesson it would never forget.

The six-month old cub was playing on the lower branches of a tree when the mother was roused from her sleep and jumped up at her young - swatting him with her paws and leaving him hanging from the branch.

The agile feline then jumped the three metre distance again - finally forcing her cub to fall to the ground as its sibling looked on from below.

After the young creature was whacked off the branch, the two leopards fell to the ground while a second cub watched on from a safe distance

Daniel Fincham, a 23-year-old game ranger, captured the sequence of photographs in the Sabi Sands Game Reserve in South Africa.

He said: 'I saw her jump and whack him off the branch, he was hanging there for some time.

'I quickly got out my camera and was just in time to capture her jumping for a second time, this time causing him to fall to the ground.'

He added: 'The two cubs had been playing on the tree while the mother was lying under them sleeping for the morning.

'This cub and his sibling have been much entertainment since they were born and I have had the pleasure of seeing them almost every day growing up. I'm looking forward to seeing their development.'
