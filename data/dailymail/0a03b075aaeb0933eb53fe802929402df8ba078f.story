Firefighters in upstate New York were unsuccessful in their efforts to rescue a dog that got stranded on the ice of the Mohawk River near Schenectady.

Fire officials in the town of Glenville said the 7-year-old Husky was about 200 yards from shore when rescue crews arrived on the scene around 3.30pm Wednesday.

The owner, who has not been named, said his pet pooch broke free while being walked and ran onto the ice floes 'of his own accord.'

Failed attempt: Firefighters in upstate New York were unsuccessful in their efforts to rescue a 7-year-old Husky that got stranded on the ice of the Mohawk River near Schenectady

Firefighters used an ice rescue team and an air boat to try and save the dog standing on an ice floe 200 yards from shore

An ice rescue team tried to reach the dog but the ice broke up and the current proved too risky, reported the Daily Gazette. A fire department airboat crew was launched, but rescue crews lost sight of the dog as it got dark.

Officials say the ice jam the dog had been on broke up and was swept downriver. 

Emergency crews responded to the Mohawk River near Maalwyck Park in Glenville after getting a call about a stranded dog Wednesday afternoon. 

The Husky was barely visible amid ice floes as darkness fell on the river and temperatures plummeted to low teens.

The owner of the runaway dog was on hand calling for his four-legged friend by name to try and make him come ashore, but to no avail.

After about two hours, rescuers lost sight of the dog when the ice floe he was on broke up and was swept downstream

Beukendaal Fire Chief Paul Chevalier told Time Warner Cable News since this is the first freeze of the river, the ice was thin; as soon as it started to crack, they had to take the rescue team out and launched an airboat at around 5pm.

By that point, however, they lost sight of the dog because the ice jam he was on had broken up and was swept by the current.

The rescue operation was officially called off at 5.30pm, about two hours after the dog ran away.

Chevalier said they put in as much effort into trying to locate the dog and bring it to safety as if they were dealing with a person.
