Argentina has defaulted for the second time in 12 years after last-ditch talks with what it called 'vulture' creditors failed.

The failure follows accusations that president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner spent close to £20,000 a 
day having the presidential plane bring her the daily newspapers while she was on holiday.

An
 Argentinian television claims she had the papers flown to the town of 
Rio Gallegos, in the south Argentinian province of Santa Cruz.

 President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has been accused of spending close to £20,000 a day having newspapers delivered to her while she was on holiday

 aired on the programme shows a paper boy leaving the plane in Santa 
Cruz airport with the newspapers that were then delivered to the 
president at her house.

Opposition UCR party politician Anselmo 
Martinez said: 'I can't say that this is a particular surprise because 
our country has a history of people using state assets for their own 
purposes since the time of Nestor Kirchner.

Argentina failed to strike a deal in time to meet a midnight payment deadline after a long legal battle with hedge funds that rejected its debt restructuring following a 2002 default.

Argentina fought to suspend a U.S ruling requiring it to pay holdouts of $1.33 billion plus 
interest and preventing it from servicing its exchange debt without paying the holdouts at the same time.

A proposal for Argentinian banks to buy out the hedge funds' non-performing debt also fell through.

The 
immediate focus on solving Argentina's debt crisis is on whether a group
 of big banks and funds overseen by the International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association would declare the situation a 'credit event'.

That would set off a series of insurance payments and give most of Argentina's current bondholders the right to demand their money back immediately.

The cost of insuring Argentina's debt against default fell sharply today, however, data provider Markit said, as investors speculated a deal could be struck, even if only in the long term. The country's five-year credit default swaps fell more than 400 basis points.

The bonds at the centre of the struggle had rallied strongly on Wednesday along with Buenos Aires stocks and the peso as bets on a deal rose, but traders were left up in the air after the talks fell apart.

Even a short default will raise local companies' borrowing costs, pile more pressure on the peso, drain dwindling foreign reserves and fuel one of the world's highest inflation rates.

The default is a far cry from the mayhem following the crash in 2001-2001 when the economy collapsed around a bankrupt government and millions of Argentines lost their jobs.

This time the government is solvent. How much pain the default inflicts on Argentina, which is already in recession, will depend on how swiftly the government can extricate itself from its obligations.
