Police have released a trove of chilling photos of beautiful young women they fear may be unidentified victims of a 1970s serial killer who has already been convicted of six murders.

The intimate pictures feature women in compromising positions, were taken by Rodney Alcala, 69 - the so-called 'Dating Game killer' who was a professional photographer before being sentenced to death row.

They come from a cache of hundreds of of portraits that Alcala kept in a storage locker in Seattle.

After years of researching the pictures, detectives still have been unable to identify more than 120 of the women and their fates are unknown.

Investigators fear some or all of these women may have also been murdered by Alcala.

Detective Pat Ellis told CBS News in 
2010 that police received a tip when Alcala's sister visited him in 
jail, and he mentioned a storage locker in Seattle, Washington, which 
‘the cops don’t know about’.

The detective said Alcala was recorded
as saying: 'It's a good thing they don't know about this. I don't have 
to tell them about it. Do me a favour - get the stuff out of there… get 
it cleared out.’

But Alcala was unaware that police 
discovered a receipt for the locker at his home - and discovered 
hundreds of photos inside of women in ‘positions of supreme 
vulnerability’, Detective Ellis said.

Alcala, 69, of California - who has 
been in prison since 1979 - is a former photographer and infamously 
appeared as ‘bachelor number one’ on the TV show Dating Game in 1978.

He was sentenced to 25 years to life 
in prison in New York last week for the murders of Cornelia Crilley, 23,
and Ellen Hover, 23, in Manhattan, New York, in 1971 and 1977.

Unidentified: Authorities have no way to know how many women Alcala killed

Monster: Alcala may be responsible for the deaths of anywhere from 50 to 130 women

It was a case the brought a veteran New York City judge to tears.

Alcala said last month he wanted to 
plead guilty to the two New York murders so he could get back to 
California, where he was sentenced to death over five other killings, to
pursue an appeal there.

The killer had complained that his 
jailers in New York would not give him access to a laptop computer and 
legal records. He was imprisoned last Monday at the State 
Supreme Court in Manhattan.

Crilley was found strangled in her 
flat in 1971 and Hover was living in Manhattan when she vanished in 
1977. Her remains were found the next year in the woods on a suburban 
estate.

‘This kind of case is something I've 
never experienced - hope to never again,’ Judge Bonnie Whittner said, 
choking back tears. When she finished sentencing him, she put her head 
in her hand.

Crilley's sister said in a statement 
that she was missed. Kaitie Stigell thanked police and prosecutors for 
treating Crilley like she mattered, because ‘she matters to us and she 
always will’.

Ladies' man: Alcala had a way with women, and even appeared on the Dating Game in 1978

Horror: Upon sentencing him for his part in the deaths of two women in New York in the 1970s, a judge wept calling his crimes 'inexplicably brutal and horrific'

Machine: Authorities described Alcala as one of history's most brutal and focused serial killers

Killer: Before his 2013 sentencing, Alcala had already been convicted in the murders of five other women

Potential victims: Hundreds of images where discovered in Alcala's storage

Evil: Alcala was known to sexually assault his victims before strangling them

Stigell was asked later about the 
judge's emotional reaction. ‘It was overwhelming and it meant a lot to 
me,’ she said. ‘It's just a testament of how everybody involved in this 
has been so good.’

Hover's sisters said in a statement 
that ‘her senseless murder irreparably damaged our family’. They spoke 
of her estranged brother's drug abuse and suicide, and their mother's 
struggles with alcohol.

Alcala has spent three decades 
tangling with California authorities in a series of trials and 
overturned convictions. He was found guilty in 2010 of killing four 
women and a 12-year-old girl in the 1970s.

He had been eyed in Hover's death for 
decades and in Crilley's killing for at least several years. For the 
latest two killings, he was sentenced in New York by Judge Whittner to 
25 years to life.

these photos, contact Detective Patrick Ellis at Huntington Beach Police
in California at 714-375-5066 or pellis@hbpd.org. All the images can be viewed at CBS News.
