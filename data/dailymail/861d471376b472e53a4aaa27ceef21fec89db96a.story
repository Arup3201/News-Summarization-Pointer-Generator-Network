Humiliation: Viewers complained about the impact Alison Brunton's Lady Gaga performance would have on her teenage children who were filmed watching from the wings

Ofcom has launched an investigation into whether the airing of two auditions on X Factor has breached its broadcasting code.

The TV regulator is looking in to two acts aired on the show - a risque impersonation of Britney Spears and a cringe-worthy performance of a Lady Gaga hit.

Ofcom received 35 complaints about hopeful Alison Brunton's performance of Lady Gaga's The Edge of Glory while her apparently embarrassed children watched from the wings.

Many viewers feared that her children - aged 14 and 16 - could get bullied at school after her out of tune performance was aired on September 1.

At the end of the song, judge Mel B labelled the performance 'horrific', telling her: 'That should never have happened. I wished I had never watched that.'

Fellow judge Louis Walsh added: 'It was a little bit like somebody drunk at a wedding.'

Ofcom is looking into whether the clip has breached the part of the code requiring TV shows to take 'due care of the physical and emotional welfare and dignity of people under 18 who take part or are otherwise involved in programmes'.

It states that children should not be 'caused unnecessary distress or anxiety by their involvement in programmes or by the broadcast of those programmes'.

Viewers were also uncomfortable. One 
wrote on Twitter: ‘Watching The X-Factor, oh no I feel sorry for those 
two teenage kids. The humiliation!!’

Another said: ‘Oh X-Factor, you are so cruel.’

Britney Spears impersonator Lorna 
Bliss also sparked controversy and 34 complaints from members of the 
public after she turned up to her audition in a white body stocking and 
extremely skimpy lime green underwear.

Many were horrified that her performance was aired before 9pm when many children would have been watching.

World Ends.

Ofcom are looking at whether her act breached taste and decency rules.

Judge Louise Walsh, who Bliss had 
managed to jump on while performing, told her: 'I wasn't expecting that.
I've done this for nine years and that's the first time that's 
happened.

Singer Tulisa then accused her of only wanting fame - and having no appreciate or passion for music.

She said: 'You are in this for the fame, not because you want to be a musician or an artist.'

Both acts were rejected by the judges.

An ITV spokesman said: ‘The  X Factor
is a well-established format and contestants regularly bring along 
their family to support them as Alison did.

‘Footage of family members is only used when appropriate consent has been obtained.’
