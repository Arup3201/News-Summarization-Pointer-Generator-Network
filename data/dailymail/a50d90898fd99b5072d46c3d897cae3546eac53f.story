Manchester
 United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and 
will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial 
traits.

Here,
 Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new 
book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old
 Trafford.

They call Louis van Gaal ‘The Iron Tulip’, a moniker that exquisitely sums up his essential Dutch stubborness.

The tall, proud figure who is about to take charge of Manchester United believes that the coach is in charge. He will lead with the right state of mind and he expects his players to follow suit.

All in the mind: For Van Gaal, training is as much about the player's mental framework as it is about tactics

Training is not just about acquiring tactical skills, but also the mental framework that will underline them.

He’s always been the same: it was this men tality that brought his success and not the other way round.

His first big job as head coach of Dutch giants Ajax came in September 1991, a shock appointment when Leo Beenhakker went to Real Madrid, and the club chose their former youth coach despite a campaign for the return of legend Johan Cruyff.

‘I sat in my car and suddenly I realised “I am technical director of Ajax”. I began sweating profusely,’ Van Gaal revealed in an interview with, of all magazines, Playboy. ‘That feeling lasted for only one minute. Afterwards I never again had that feeling.’

Certainly his players learned in no time that their new manager wouldn’t tolerate anybody who broke the rules. If anybody arrived just a minute late for training, Van Gaal the disciplinarian fined them. If it happened again it was doubled. A third time and it was doubled again.

Van Gaal would get irritated over players not putting used towels in the laundry basket in the dressing room. If someone threw his towel elsewhere he could take it home and wash it himself.

Another hallmark was that everyone, including the superstars, would lug around the giant cases of equipment and not just the kit man or reserves.

Discipline was everything. At press conferences the players invariably appeared in the stiff club suit, with matching tie and shoes. The jacket had to be buttoned up.

He fell out with Jan Wouters, the 33-year-old veteran who had been the star of central midfield since Cruyff signed him in 1986; he fell out with Bryan Roy, humiliating the fleet-footed winger in training sessions; he sidelined Johnny  van ’t Schip, who had been part of the furniture for a decade, by  moving him to the right wing until the striker announced he no longer wanted to play there.

It wasn’t an instant success. Van Gaal’s Ajax managed just 20 points out of the first 16 games, the  supporters lost confidence and calls from the stands for Cruyff to return were mixed with those for Van Gaal to go.

His reaction? ‘I will not change my attitude,’ he said.

His confidence was proved right. By the end of his first season Ajax had won the UEFA Cup. A bright new team of young players, who had emerged through the system when Van Gaal was their youth coach, had begun to take shape.

Players who had learned under his wing such as Patrick Kluivert, Marc Overmars, Edgar Davids and Edwin van der Sar went on to win the Champions League in 1995, only failing to retain the trophy when Juventus beat them on penalties a year later.

With Van Gaal, there are no half measures. People tend to be grouped by him as either friends or enemies.

His second
 wife Truus once worked as a PR manager and so can offer him help on 
polishing his image, but he is neither bothered nor interested.

He
 says: ‘If I think something unfair is taking place, I react. That has 
nothing to do with respect. You can turn it around; the other person has
 failed to show respect for me.’

Those who work for him and follow his lead will tell you he is warm and generous with his time and his conversation. But he will cut dead those who take a different path.

Years after his first glory days at Ajax - when, during a second spell at the club, he was falling out with star players again but this time without the same success - he was asked if he had ever read the book  I am always right by the Dutch author Willem Frederik Hermans.

‘I know 
Hermans, but not that book,’ replied Van Gaal. ‘A catchy title but I 
would never say that about myself. I would add the nuance: “I usually am
 right”.’

There
 is a saying that nobody gets to know what would have happened. That’s 
certainly true of Louis van Gaal’s years as a player.

He wanted to make it as a star in the Ajax first team; his family wanted him to study as a PE teacher.What’s
 certain is that in trying to do both he cost himself the chance of the 
sort of star career on the field that would match what he later achieved
 as a coach.

Just 17 when he enrolled in the Academy of Physical Education in the Amsterdam suburb of Geuzenveld, he stuck to his studies even when two years later he was spotted by Ajax.

They gave him a Fiat 127 to replace his Puch moped, but did little else to make life easy over two seasons.

‘These
 were two heavy, hard years,’ said Van Gaal, ‘because I simultaneously 
played football and studied to become a PE teacher. 

‘But
 my game mentality took shape in those years and that still benefits me.
 You see, playing football well is not enough; you have to want to win.’

If Ajax formed his football philosophy, his time first studying and then working in schools was  also a major influence. Manchester United’s players will find a bit of coach, a bit of social worker, and a lot of school teacher about their new boss.

He says himself that studying in the Academy was where ‘I learned what makes people tick’.

Ajax and Dutch manager Rinus Michels, credited as the architect of total football, was one of his role models because he’d also experienced life outside the professional game.

Van Gaal said: ‘Michels was a PE teacher
 first as well. Players are just like big children. So there really is a
 resemblance between being a teacher and being a coach.’

His first taste of the job he dreamed of as manager of his own country ended in failure with a Dutch squad that imploded and failed even to qualify for the World Cup in 2002.

Even then, in his own mind, that failure was the fault of the players and not him. ‘Some of the players refused to accept my methods,’ he said. ‘I am who I am and I have my own ways. I’m not going to change and I have no desire to.’

In 2009, when he started work at Bayern Munich and results took time to come, it was reported that he had been heard going round the dressing room insisting: ‘I am like God. I never get ill and I am always right.’ A few months later, Van Gaal put the record straight. ‘I am not God,’ he said. ‘If I were God I would win everything all the time.’

At Old Trafford they will have to get used to that.

Assured: During his time in Munich, Van Gaal compared himself to God and insisted he was always right
