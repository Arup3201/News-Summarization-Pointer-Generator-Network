It is used to broadcast happiness, express sadness and vent frustration. So it is perhaps no surprise that Twitter could help spot post-natal depression.

Microsoft scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born.

The information could be used to treat women sooner or simply to ensure they have the help and practical support they need after the birth.

In future, it may be possible to create an app – a computer programme that can be run on a smartphone – to provide early warning and dispense advice.

Around one in seven new mothers suffers from post-natal depression but the stigma surrounding the condition leaves many afraid to seek help.

Eric Horvitz, head of Microsoft Research’s biggest lab, hopes that by making diagnosis easier, more new mothers will get the attention they need.

However, there are likely to concerns about privacy, particularly when dealing with the sensitive area of public health.

Dr Horvitz began by scanning archives of Twitter messages –  ‘tweets’ of up to 140 characters posted publically on the internet - for words and phrases related to the announcement of a birth.

When he was satisfied he had identified several hundred new mothers, he began to analyse the their messages from the three months before and after having their baby.

He looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on Twitter, the people they were in touch with and the language used.

For instance, an increase in the use of ‘I’ suggests someone is becoming more introspective and self-focused and has been linked to the onset of depression.

He then created software that analysed
 pre-birth tweets to predict with over 70 per cent accuracy if a 
woman’s Twitter messages would show signs of depression after having her
 baby.

Adding in her tweets in the first fortnight after motherhood boosted the accuracy to 80 per cent.

A
 second study using Facebook posts confirmed that even although 
depression doesn’t hit until post-birth, changes in social network 
activity and postings pre-birth provide information about who is likely 
to be hit.

Dr Horvitz said ‘we can predict future behaviour and mood with well-characterised confidence’.

He told the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science’s (MUST CREDIT) annual conference that 
someone could use his basic research to create and early-warning system 
that a pregnant women could install on her mobile phone.

He
 said: ‘Reading some of these tweets you can almost feel yourself in the
 hearts and minds of these people. You really feel for them as they 
struggle.

‘Imagine a new mums’ coach that was an app running on your own smartphone that might watch what you say to the world and your tweets. 

‘It might say “I sense you might be grappling with this, here’s more reading about this, don’t worry it will last this long and here are resources for you”, versus people just being abandoned right now and crying on their own and being paralysed.’

He added that while there are likely to be ethical concerns, the app would be something that was run privately, on a woman’s own phone.

Stuart Dobson, of post-natal depression charity the PANDAS Foundation, said many women with post-natal depression find the thought of a medical appointment daunting and would welcome a test they could do in the comfort of their own home.

However, he questioned whether they would get the support the needed afterwards.
