At least Ryan Giggs could see the funny side. As he sat down to take his last press conference in this current stint as Manchester United manager, the players of Manchester City appeared on a large television screen with the trophy he knows so well.

‘Can someone switch that off, please,’ he said, only half joking.

What strange times these are for Giggs and the club he has served for most of his life. Moments earlier he was part of the contingent that walked to the corner of the ground where the away fans were singing and dancing. Perhaps predictably, missing out on the Europa League was not met with grief.

Maybe there were other reasons for the joy. The end of suffering in a humiliating season, most likely. And it was also the end of an era.

Not so much the era of United’s 
dominance – that ship hoisted anchor before Christmas. But what of the 
cogs, men like Giggs and his class-mates from 1992?

Giggs
 had nothing new to say on that score after the game. ‘I think the 
managerial situation will be sorted next week and I will need to think 
about my own position,’ he said.

With
 Louis van Gaal’s intentions towards the existing staff not totally 
clear, that is a position in limbo. ‘I need to decide whether to play 
on, stay on in the staff - and what position that is going to be - or 
take a year off football,’ Giggs said.

And
 what of Rio Ferdinand, whose contract is up? His waving at the end 
appeared more of a goodbye than a ‘see you later’. Then there was 
Nemanja Vidic. They have good memories at United. A cruel person might 
say they’ll need them.

But 
in any case, they were remembering Vidic the colossus. He was dreadful on Sunday and has often looked poor since announcing he is off to Inter 
Milan. But they love him and, at the moment, history is all they have.

There
 is no telling how long these supporters will have to wait. Giggs says 
‘there is a lot to look forward to’, and channelled ‘the positives’, 
namely that United’s first season without European football since the 
Heysel bans of the Eighties will be a good thing.

‘It
 might help with our league form and cup runs,’ he said. ‘If we do well 
in the cups it gets the amount of games up and everyone gets a chance 
because we need to keep a squad for when we get back in Europe next 
year.’

But Giggs is an optimist. This performance, as if further proof were needed, showed the stark limitations of the side.

Within
 five minutes, one of Vidic’s touches went straight into touch. Two 
minutes later he clearly handled in his area and, shortly before the 
half-hour, he was left covered in blood from an incident that led to 
Rickie Lambert’s opener.

The
 England striker elbowed Vidic as they contested an aerial ball – it did
 not appear to be malicious – but Mike Dean incorrectly opted against 
giving United a free-kick. Steven Davis then played in Lambert to score 
his 13th league goal of a fine season, before Juan Mata levelled with a 
delightful free-kick.

Luke Shaw was brilliant at left back in front of Roy Hodgson and is going to Brazil. Southampton team-mate Adam Lallana impressed in midfield as well.

Rickie Lambert scored for Saints but was generally quiet.

United’s Danny Welbeck and Chris Smalling struggled to make an impact but Michael Carrick’s arrival as a substitute helped turn the game in his team’s favour.

Of 
course, Southampton now face their own period of uncertainty. Mauricio 
Pochettino continues to sidestep direct questions about his future, with
 Tottenham looming.

‘I still
 have one year on my contract and it is normal that these rumours crop 
up,’ he said, as he always does. He was marginally more effusive in his 
appraisal of a stunning season. ‘The way we played throughout, they way 
we took eighth place, this makes me proud,’ he said.

But Southampton are looking at a near future that quite feasibly will not include Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw or their manager.

Those will be huge losses. But they are still on an up-slope. It’s been a long year since United could say the same.
