There seems to be a wave of chargers that promise to speed up the time it takes to fully charge a phone or tablet.

But many of the technologies are either concepts or in the very early stages of development.

The SONICable is different - not only does it claim to halve the amount of time it takes to get a battery from zero to 100 per cent, it is available to pre-order for both iPhone and Android handsets now.

When connected, but switched off, the SONICable acts like a standard USB cable and will charge the device as well as sync content. But, when switched on, syncing is disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging. Its makers claim this halves the amount of time it takes to get a battery from zero to 100%

Technically, it’s still a prototype, but working models are available from Indiegogo and will ship in less than two months.

Designed by a team from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the SONICable has two functions.

When it’s plugged into a device, but switched off, it acts like a standard USB cable and syncs content from one device to another.

SONICable comes with a Lightning connector (centre), for the iPhone 5 and later models, the fourth generation iPad and above, and the iPad mini range. It also has a microUSB (left) option that will work for HTC, Samsung and other compatible devices, including eReaders. The other end of the cable is powered by a USB port (right)

Other features of the SONICable (pictured) include a dual-sided USB port, durable aluminium connectors and nylon protective material. It is available in black and white from Indiegogo

But, when it is switched on, the syncing functions are disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging the connected device.

An Israeli company has developed technology that can charge a mobile phone in a few seconds and an electric car in minutes.

Using nano-technology, Tel Aviv-based StoreDot said its battery can store a higher charge more quickly, in effect acting like a super-dense sponge to soak up power.

While the prototype is currently far too bulky for a mobile phone, the company believes it will be ready by 2016.

The Indiegogo campaign features a graphic that shows the SONICable charging a device twice as fast as a traditional charger.

The SONICable is expected to ship in March.

Its Indiegogo campaign has already raised $178,832 (£118,195) of its $10,000 (£6,610) target.

The $20 (£13) and $23 (£15) Early Bird prices have sold out, but backers can still buy a single cable for $27 (£18), or $49 (£32) for two.

After the initial run of cables are shipped, they will retail for $36 (£24).
