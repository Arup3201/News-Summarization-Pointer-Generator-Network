The school's head teacher Ruth Jackson says children are thriving in the Christian environment

A church primary school now has more Muslim pupils in each class than Christians.

St Mary The Virgin Primary School, in Butetown, Cardiff, has been run for more than 100 years by the church in the Welsh city's former docklands - and children are thriving in the diverse environment, which allows everyone to pray together, regardless of faith.

The latest inspection report of the school in Butetown shows that out of 181 pupils 90 per cent come from an ethnic minority background.

The school was described as 'excellent' by inspectors with 73 per cent speak an additional language as well as English.

It is the only school run by the Church in Wales which has less Christian pupils than Muslims on its register.

Headteacher Ruth Jackson said: 'We are unique as we are a Church school where the majority of pupils are Muslim.

'We have an ethos of tolerance and respect and shared values.

'Everyone prays together and there is also time for pupils to follow their own faith.

'The spiritual and moral development of the pupils is a priority.'

Many of the children aged three to 11 are from Yemeni and Somali backgrounds - with many of the parents refugees who move to the area.

Some of the pupils speak no English when they arrive but are thriving in the Christian environment.

Mrs Jackson added: 'This is an absolutely fantastic result which reflects the hard work and dedication of the whole school community.'

The report praised the 'inclusive' environment which allowed pupils to flourish and gave them the space to practice their own faith

Inspectors said many were 'outperforming all expectations, making exemplary progress with good literacy and numeracy.'

It also said an 'inclusive' environment allowed pupils to flourish and gave them the space to practice their own faith.

Other
nationalities in the school include Saudi Arabian and Bangladeshi - 
with all having to learn to speak Welsh as well as English.

Reporting inspector Terwyn Tomas said: 'Pupils generally enter the school with skill levels that are considerably lower than average.

'As they progress through the school, pupils make excellent progress and achieve at a level significantly higher than predicted by their earlier attainment.

The school was described as 'excellent' by inspectors with 73 per cent speak an additional language as well as English

'Given the differing linguistic backgrounds of the pupils, the improvement of pupils' literacy skills over the past three years is an outstanding feature.'

Chair of governors Canon Graham Francis said: 'This excellent inspection report is the result of the professionalism, hard work and commitment of all the members of the school staff.'

He said the school is 'an exciting, dynamic multi ethnic school which celebrates the cultural diversity of the community.'
