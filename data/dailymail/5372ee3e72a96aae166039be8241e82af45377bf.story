Ed Miliband's plan to impose a mansion tax is 'crude' and would end up 'clobbering' people, Lord Mandelson warned last night.

The Labour grandee launched a stinging attack of the party leader's flagship policy claiming it was 'short-termist'.

To add further insult, Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, said he preferred the policy drawn up by the Liberal Democrats to introduce extra council tax bands for high-value homes.

Mr Miliband has said his plan for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million would raise £1.2billion a year, which would be spent on the NHS.

But he is already facing civil war within his party over the policy, with strong criticism from many including potential London Mayoral candidates Diane Abbott, Dame Tessa Jowell, David Lammy and Margaret Hodge.

In an interview with BBC Newsnight last night, Lord Mandelson acknowledged: 'We don't have an efficient way of taxing property in Britain.'

But he added: 'I don't happen to think the mansion tax is the right policy response to that, I think it's crude, I think it's short-termist, what we need is what I think the Liberal Democrats are proposing and that is the introduction of further bands that relate to different values of property within the council tax system, that's what I would like to see, it will take longer to introduce, that's true, but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short-term mansion tax.'

Full details have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls last year said homes worth between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income.

Critics warn the tax will disproportionately hit London and the South East, where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans.

Labour estimates the tax will apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the homes in the country.

People earning less than £42,000 will be able to defer paying the charge until their property changes hands in an effort to protect people, especially in the capital, who have seen the value of their house soar in recent years.

Lord Mandelson said: 'You do need a fair, progressive taxation system where people who are earning the most and accumulating the most wealth pay the most.

'And for very many people they shouldn't pay anything at all, because they simply don't have the incomes, or the wealth, or the assets, to support that.'

The former business secretary said he was not worried about the message being sent out by the mansion tax, but he added: 'I want policy effectiveness, I want efficiency.

'I think people are entitled to expect thought-through, sophisticated responses to serious problems.'

He told Newsnight: 'We have to make sure that what we are doing is, in a sense, recreating the policies that we saw in the Clinton-Blair era, where we saw a pro-business, liberal economic approach but combined with very strong policies and interventions by government in order to create opportunities for individuals and to redistribute income and wealth more fairly.'

Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘With Mandelson joining the chorus of Labour voices opposed to Labour's homes tax, it is clearer than ever that Ed Miliband is a weak leader peddling a bad policy. 

'It is yet more proof that he simply isn't up to the job of running the country.’ 

The Liberal Democrat plan, backed by Lord Mandelson, would involve a series of extra bands of taxation for properties worth more than £2million on top of council tax.

Earlier this month, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy caused outrage from within the party after he set out plans to use millions of pounds raised from the tax in England to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border.

MPs queued up to attack Mr Murphy after he boasted that would boost the NHS in Scotland by using up to £250million raised from the tax in England.

Just 0.3 per cent of the £1.2billion raised by the tax - around £3.6million - will come from Scotland, but it will receive a huge share of the revenues.

Former Labour leadership Miss Abbott accused Mr Murphy of trying to 'buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London'.

And former Labour Cabinet minister Dame Tessa warned him against treating the South East as a 'cash cow'.

In November, Mr Miliband was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the proposal by Myleene Klass.

The singer and classical musician tore strips out of his pledge during a television debate, telling him that it was 'disturbing'.

'You may as well just tax me on this glass of water,' she told him during the angry exchange. 'You can't just point at things and tax them.'

A year after New Labour came to power in 1997, Lord Mandelson famously said: 'We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes.'

He bought an £8million house in London four years ago.

A Labour Party spokeswoman said: 'The mansion tax will help fund a Time To Care Fund to pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, 5,000 more home care workers and 3,000 more midwives.

'When working people have seen their wages fall by £1,600 a year since 2010 it is right to ask those who have the most to make a bigger contribution.'
