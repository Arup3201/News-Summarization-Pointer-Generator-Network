Beatrice did her bit for festive goodwill last night as she attended a party launching a fashion collaboration to raise money for charity.

The princess wore black leather-trim jacket, skater skirt and studded slippers for the Mayfair event, which was to launch of a pair of shoes set to raise funds for a human trafficking campaign.

The party was held Beulah, a fashion brand label beloved by other royals including the Duchess of Cambridge which donates a percentage of all its profits to charity.

The event marked a collaboration with shoe brand French Sole that sees the launch of a £185 velvet grey ballet shoe with blue trim, from which 25 per cent of profits will go to support the United Nation's Blue Heart campaign.

With
 the money raised the brands say they hope to 'help to support victims 
of trafficking, raise awareness of the problem and inspire the powerful 
decision-makers to effect change.'

Beulah's founders Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs and Lavinia Brennan
 are long-standing friends of the Royals, and indeed have seen their 
clothes worn by both Beatrice and Eugenie as well as the Duchess of 
Cambridge, who famously wore a £540 Beulah dress on her Far East tour in
 2012.

The pale blue silk chiffon and matching headscarf, worn for a visit to a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, earned her plaudits from fashion observers and was later reissued and went on sale in Harvey Nichols.

Other
 celebrities have worn Beulah's styles, including Tess Daly, who wore a 
red silk dress on Strictly Come Dancing last weekend, and opera singer 
Katherine Jenkins, who often wears the brand's silk Niyana scarf.

Launched
 in 2011, Beulah London state that they wish to help provide a 
sustainable livelihood to those that have escaped the sex trafficking 
trade.

The founders launched
 the ethical label after working together in the Delhi slums with women 
and girls who had been forced into prostitution.

'With
 each beautiful garment that you buy there is an equally beauftiful 
change happening somewhere else in the world, something that Beulah like
 to call the butterfly effect.,' they say.

Beulah founders Natasha and Lavinia say: 'Beulah London traces its origins back to 2009, when the two of us had a life transforming opportunity to work in Atulya, an aftercare home in Delhi slums.

'Having witnessed the harrowing effects of human trafficking and sex trade, we felt moved to raise awareness of this important issue. With no formal training in fashion, we hit on an idea of launching an ethical fashion label with a transparent supply chain, focused on timeless and effortless elegance. Beulah London was launched in 2011, helping provide a sustainable livelihood to those that have come out of sex trafficking.

'For each beautiful garment that we make, there is an equally beautiful change happening somewhere else in the world – we like to think of it as our ‘butterfly effect’: A small change at one place in a complex system having a large effect elsewhere.

'The term "Beulah" itself is symbolic of our philosophy, representing the journey of each woman out of darkness and despair, into a new life of hope and restoration.

'As a young business we are at the start of a challenging journey. Driven by our twin passions for positive social change and designing beautiful fashions, we believe that we are on the right path.

'Each Beulah garment purchase comes with a canvas bag that has been produced by the victims of trafficking in India through a project based in Kolkata, Freeset.

Added to this, certain items in our main collections have been produced through a project in Delhi, Open Hand, by women who have escaped trafficking and the sex trade, including some who are HIV positive and widowed.

'Where you see the Beulah butterfly logo, you know that the product has either been made by women who have been trafficked, or been produced specifically to raise awareness or funds for its victims.

The Beulah effect comes alive through every small purchase you make, helping break the chains of poverty in some of the world's most marginalised communities.'
