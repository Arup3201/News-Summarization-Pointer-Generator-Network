It seems cricketer Kevin Pietersen is struggling with a dose of jet lag as he returns to England following the completion of the Cricket World Cup.

The former England captain posted a picture to Instagram of himself struggling to stay awake while on board an Emirates flight.

Pietersen was a pundit as  Australia were crowned tournament winners at the expense of New Zealand in Melbourne.

However, jet lag is probably not the only reason Pietersen is struggling to stay awake after joining in with Australiaâ€™s post-tournament celebrations following victory.

Earlier this week Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart praised Pietersen's 'outstanding' character, but admitted the batsman's chances of an England return are slim.

Pietersen has re-joined Surrey to play in LV= County Championship Division Two in a bid to win a Test recall for the Ashes this summer.
