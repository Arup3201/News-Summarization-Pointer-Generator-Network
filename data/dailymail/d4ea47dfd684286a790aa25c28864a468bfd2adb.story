A polygamist with five wives and 24 children has revealed the logistical nightmare he faces when it comes to Valentine's Day in the latest episode of TLC's My Five Wives.

Brady Williams, 43, from Salt Lake City, Utah, is followed by cameras as he forks out a small fortune on flowers in a bid to keep his spouses happy.

He then loads the bouquets into his SUV and darts from house to house to drop them off, performing the same kiss and hug ritual over and over. 'It's a lot of work!' the construction project manager tells viewers.

However, he adds that he's got the holiday down to a fine art and he knows exactly what will win the ladies over.

'I have never gone wrong getting flowers,' he grins. 'They just love them whether it's just one or a dozen, it's all good.'

When he visits a local florist he requests five large, rose-laden bouquets containing 'similar but different' stems.

When the store worker asks what to write on the accompanying cards, Brady casually replies: 'Just Happy Valentine's Day I love you and then five different names.'

He later interjects: 'Are you catching on that I'm a polygamist?' to which the bemused woman replies: 'Either that, or you've got lots of girlfriends.'

Brady visits his fifth wife, 34-year-old Rhonda first, followed by his fourth wife Nonie, 35, second wife Robyn, 40, third wife Rosemary, 40, and lastly, his first wife, Paulie, 41.

'I should have just got them delivered,' he says breaking a sweat.

While his most recent marriage was to Rhonda, 14 years ago.

Although polygamy is common within the Mormon community, the Williams' gradually withdrew from the fundamentalist church after reevaluating their core beliefs.

Talking about their unusual living arrangement, Brady said: 'The reason we're together is because we love each other, we're committed and we want this.

'We've
 got six people who we have to keep on falling in love with over and 
over again and I think, personally, that that's a beautiful thing.'

The Williams, whose children range in age from two to 20, said they took part on TLC's 'My Five Wives to dispel the myths surrounding their unconventional lifestyle.

'All of America's having sex,' Brady previously said in an interview with the Huffington Post. 'And it's no big deal to just answer it and to just say 'Duh no we're not perverted, we're not twisted, we're just normal. Normal times five.'
