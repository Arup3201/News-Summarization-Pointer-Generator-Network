A small town in Queensland experienced the bewildering force of nature on Thursday night as an enormous dust storm swept through and engulfed the area in darkness.

Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, at about 6.30pm, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes.

Residents of the remote outback town said that they had never seen anything like it, as incredible images of the dust storm are revealed.

Bedourie, which borders the Simpson Desert, has a population of only 110 people, with the town's name literally translates to 'dust storm' in the local indigenous language

The stunning phenomena is captured in the photographs as powerful winds pick up debris of dirt and dust and push them ahead of an approaching storm.  

Dust storms are not uncommon in the area, and are caused in part by the heat of Western Australia which results in thunderstorms forming very high above the ground. 

'Because of this, any rain can evaporate before it hits the ground. As the atmosphere cools with this evaporating rain, it sinks compared to the surrounding hot air, and very strong winds speeds become much more likely,' Meteorologist Tony Auden told Yahoo.

Lindsay Barr, who is on a working holiday around Australia, was serving in the local pub, Bedourie Hotel, when she and her workmates saw the dust cloud approaching. 

'We saw it from really far away, and it looked like clouds. We weren't sure if it was smoke or dust,' Lindsay said.

'I'm from Scotland so I didn't have a clue what it was, and it came closer and got much bigger. One of the locals came running in and told us to run and hide, so we shut all the windows and went downstairs,' she said. 

'It was coming after us, that's for sure.'

Linsday said she and the others in the pub waited for about 20 minutes before emerging, and found the town outside covered in red dust.

'People have been outside sweeping today, and the roads are still dusty but other than that life is pretty much back to normal,' she said.
