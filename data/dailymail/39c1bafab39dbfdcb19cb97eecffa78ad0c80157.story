Shame: Kimberley Hainey murdered her son Declan and concealed his death. She has been jailed for a minimum of 15 years

A woman who murdered her toddler son and left his body in a cot for so long it 'mummified' was today jailed for a minimum of 15 years.

Kimberley Hainey, 37, was found guilty by a majority verdict last month of murdering her son Declan at a flat in Paisley, Renfrewshire.

His decomposing body was found in a cot in March 2010 - eight months after he was last seen.

Hainey was also convicted of failing to report Declan’s death to police or other authorities and of concealing his body at the flat.

At the High Court in Glasgow, she was handed a life sentence and told she will spend a minimum of 15 years behind bars.

Hainey was also sentenced to seven 
years for attempting to defeat the ends of justice, which will run 
concurrently with the 15 years.

The court heard that the child’s body was partially 'mummified' when it was found on March 30, when he would have 
been 23 months old.

He was last seen alive in August 2009 and experts estimated he had been dead for up to eight months.

Sentencing Hainey, Lord Woolman said: 
'Declan’s first birthday took place in April 2009, he appeared to have 
all his life in front of him.

'He was surrounded by a loving family and people thought you were a loving mother. A few months later he was dead.'

Lord Woolman said: 'You were Declan's
carer. You did not allow others to get close to him. Instead you 
isolated him from your family, your neighbours, your friends and from 
the welfare services.

'None of them thought that Declan's life was at risk. You engineered that situation.

'The jury convicted you of willfully 
ill-treating and neglecting Declan, of failing to provide him with 
adequate nourishment and fluids, of leaving him alone unattended for 
excessive periods of time, and of failing to seek and provide medical 
aid and care for him.

'In addition, you took significant 
steps to cover up what happened. I take all these matters into account 
in assessing the seriousness of the crime.'

He added: 'You embarked on a 
systematic and elaborate course of conduct to prevent people knowing, or
suspecting, that Declan was dead.

'It was a lengthy course of deceit that prevented proper inquiries being made.'

He said that Declan's death had a 'devastating effect' on the family.

In mitigation, he acknowledged that 
Hainey had had difficulty with drink and drugs and that her son's death 
was a 'huge tragedy' for her, as she said she loved the boy 'more than 
anything in the world'.

Hainey's defence counsel Edward Targowski QC said his client, a former heroin addict, denied killing the child.

He said: 'As far as Miss Hainey is concerned, she is still adamant that she had no involvement in the death of her child.

'Her position is that she found 
Declan dead in the morning, as she stated in her evidence, and her 
actions afterwards in relation to the charge of attempting to pervert 
the course of justice were as a consequence of that.

'That position is one that she has 
held at consultation from the outset. She held it during evidence and it
is one she will continue to hold after the sentence.'

Rubbish strewn cot: The bed where Declan Hainey was left dead for up to eight months is filled with waste including empty bottles of Irn-Bru, 3 Hammers cider, Lucozade, vodka and crisp packets. On the table are strewn cans of Tennents lager and more snack packaging, with more rubbish on the floor

The cause of Declan’s death is not known.

Hainey pretended the child was being 
cared for by family members or that he was at nursery, leading people to
believe he was still alive.

Following the trial the Crown Office yesterday released photographs of rooms inside Hainey's  flat piled with rubbish.

One shows what appears to be a travel
cot or playpen filled with empty plastic bottles and debris while 
others show apparently mouldy milk bottles.

Filthy: A dirty kitchen counter in the flat in Paisley, Renfrewshire, covered in unwashed dishes, empty containers including Clover margarine, Lurpak butter, a host of microwave meals, hamburger packaging and a bottle of pills

Squalid: A table in the living room is covered in dirty plates, cans of beer, Irn-Bru, shampoo bottles, a Pot Noodle container stuffed with cigarette butts, a curry house menu and even Christmas cards

The Crown is considering whether a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) should be held into his death.

A report on the case was commissioned
by Tim Huntingford, the independent chairman of the Renfrewshire Child 
Protection Committee (RCPC), on behalf of Renfrewshire Council and the 
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board.

The RCPC oversees the services and 
agencies which look after vulnerable children in the area and will 
consider the report later this month before it goes to the appropriate 
council policy board.

Shocking: Bottles of rotten milk in various states of decay line up along the top of a radiator near Declan's cot

A number of changes recommended in the report have already been implemented in Renfrewshire.

Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont 
has called for an inquiry into the death and said she was seeking a 
meeting with the First Minister to explore how best to address the 
'scandal' of child abuse.

A Scottish Government spokesman said:
'The death of Declan Hainey was an appalling tragedy and these shocking
images simply underline the dreadful suffering he was forced to endure.

'The First Minister will consider any
request for a meeting and a decision on holding a Fatal Accident 
Inquiry is a matter for the law officers.

'The Scottish Government is ensuring 
protection is in place for all children at risk of neglect, and in 2010 
launched new National Child Protection guidance clearly outlining 
expectations for local risk assessment procedures - including where 
children are in potential danger from substance misuse issues.'

Barely room to walk: Photos taken by investigators also show several empty vodka bottles, Dorito packets, clothes alongside a bag of nappies

Appalling: A remote control on a reclining sofa is swamped by a dirty duvet, beer cans, lighters, cigarette papers, tobacco, ashes, crisp packets and a half-eaten microwave meal

Evidence of a young life: Declan's bedroom with a wardrobe filled with a few of his tiny outfits with toys on top. Right, his barely used push chair surrounded by rubbish

Pitiful: Despite the squalor elsewhere, Declan's socks and slippers are arranged neatly beside toys and a fabric book on a shelf

Strathclyde Police detective inspector Maxine Martin said: 'I take no personal satisfaction from the sentence delivered to Kimberley Hainey today, although I am satisfied that justice has been served.

'This has been a very traumatic time for Declan's family and I sincerely hope that they can now try and move on with their life.

'Declan Hainey's death was a harrowing and tragic case.

'I doubt that anyone involved in the investigation or who has followed any of the media coverage of the case will have encountered anything quite as distressing.

'A team of highly-experienced detective and uniform officers worked on this inquiry. They were supported by some of the best forensic experts in the country.

'I would like to thank those officers for their commitment and professionalism whilst working on this harrowing investigation.

Wretched: Declan's bedroom with the floor covered in clothes and toys, including the box of a Mothercare Happy Safari Mobile

Grime: An empty milk bottle sits alongside several packets of Heinz Tomato Ketchup and a bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder beside the TV set

'We will never know the extent of 
Declan's suffering, nor will we ever understand how a mother could 
behave in this way towards an innocent and defenceless child, her own 
child.

'There was one person and one person alone who was responsible for Declan's death, and that was his mother Kimberley Hainey.

'She deceived everyone who was close 
to her. She went out of her way to conceal what she did from her 
friends, her family and also from the various agencies who only wanted 
to help her.'

Kenny Donnelly, district procurator fiscal for Paisley, said: 'Declan Hainey was born a healthy child.

'However, he was later neglected and 
murdered by his mother, Kimberley Hainey. She then concealed Declan's 
body and embarked upon a course of deception in which she led others to 
believe that he was still alive.

'This was a tragic and distressing case and today Kimberley Hainey has been rightly punished by the court for her actions.'
