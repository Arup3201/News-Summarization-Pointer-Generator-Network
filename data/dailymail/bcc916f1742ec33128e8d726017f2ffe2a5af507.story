Today's teenagers are less likely to drink, smoke and take drugs than their predecessors making them the most sensible generation for a decade, according to statistics.

Department of Health figures also show that the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped dramatically over a 40-year period - with abortions in recent years also showing a decline.

Government officials have claimed the downward trend could be explained by a changing demographic, as there are far more young Muslims in the UK today, who do not drink, smoke or have sex. 

Some believe the behaviour shift is party a result of social media - as many teenagers spend more time interacting online through Facebook and Twitter than they do in person (picture posed by models)

Others believe the behaviour shift is partly a result of social media - as many teenagers spend more time interacting online through Facebook and Twitter than they do in person. 

This leaves less time for young people to experiment with alcohol, smoking, drugs and sex. 

Speaking to the Sunday Times, Richard de Visser, a specialist in young people's behaviour and health at Sussex University, said: 'More socialising can now happen at a distance.

'You can do social things that don't involve going out in the park drinking or trying to get into the pub.' 

Teenage pregnancy rates are at their lowest since the 1970s.

Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that the number of pregnancies in women under the age of 18 plummeted from 45,000 in 1969 to just over 30,000 in 2011. 

From 2012 to 2013 abortion rates for under 18s fell from 12.8 per 1,000 girls in 2012 to 11.7 in 2013.

Over the same period, the abortion rates for girls under the age of 16, dropped from three in every 1,000 to 2.6. 

Alison Hadley, director of the Teenage Pregnancy Knowledge Exchange at Bedfordshire University, believes that today's young people are not abstaining from sex, but that more are using contraception. 

She said 'Levels of sexual activity seem to be pretty consistent. There was a lot of work by the previous government on young people's health. 

'We should welcome the fact that if you give young people the right kind of support they will look after themselves.' 

Teenage Pregnancy Knowledge Exchange say progress made reducing teenage pregnancies will also have a positive impact on child poverty and infant mortality rates - which they say disproportionately affect children of teenage parents.

Department of Health statistics also highlight a steep decline in teenagers who describe themselves as regular smokers with a 2003 figure of 9 per cent falling to 3 per cent last year.

Similarly, figures over the same ten-year period show that the proportion of teenage school pupils who had tried drugs fell from 30 percent to 16 per cent.

Jane Ellison, the public health minister, commented: 'Trends in the drinking, smoking and teenage pregnancy rates for young people are very encouraging. 

'Figures show pregnancy in under-18s is at its lowest rate for 40 years and the numbers of young people drinking and smoking are also falling. 

'We know that we can't be complacent though. Young people who adopt healthy lifestyles early on can use them as a building block for success, using that resilience to get on in life.'
