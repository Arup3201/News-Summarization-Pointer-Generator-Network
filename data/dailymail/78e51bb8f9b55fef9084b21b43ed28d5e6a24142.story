Smiling for the camera in relief, these are the hikers who were rescued in a 10 hour operation after becoming stranded 9,000 feet up a Californian mountain.

The group from a UCLA hiking club set off on a hike up the San Gabriel Mountains in Los Angeles but conditions quickly turned treacherous, with snow and ice.

And while five members of the group managed to find their way out of the forest, the remaining eight became lost with some starting to experience hypothermia.

Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue teams were called with rescuers forced to look for the group in drifts, which caused the snow to become knee-deep.

But 10 hours after going missing, the group were finally found near Throop Peak by the Montrose Search and Rescue Team from Crescenta Valley Station.

The students were then lowered to safety down the icy slopes with harnesses and ropes to prevent them from falling.

Luckily, none of the group needed to have medical treatment but they were so elated to see their rescuers, they all stopped and posed for a selfie.

Reserve Deputy Mike Leum told ABC News: 'I've been doing this 20 years as a volunteer and I never seen anybody so happy to see us. '

The treacherous conditions which caused the hikers to become lost were caused by the same storm system which wreaked havoc on northern California in recent days.

The storm dropped 10 to 15 inches of snow at higher elevations of the Northern Sierra, according to the National Weather Service.

Meanwhile a fresh storm yesterday is thought to have brought as much as another 14 inches of snow.

Snow is more important than rain because snowpack supplies about a third of the water needed by residents, agriculture and industry.

Meanwhile strong winds fanned a wildfire that pushed across a swathe of land at the edge of the Sierra Nevada, which destroyed 40 homes and filling the sky with a hellish combination of smoke and fire.

Around 250 people were forced to evacuate in the small California towns of Swall Meadows and Paradise as flames engulfed vegetation across 11 square miles, officials say.

Authorities say the wildfire began on Friday near a highway that runs east of the Sierra Nevada before winds caused the blaze to spread.
