After losing 1-0 to Roma last week, Liverpool enjoyed more success in Sunday's game against Greek champions Olympiacos.

An early goal from Raheem Sterling was enough to give the English side victory in their opening game of the friendly competition that also includes Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Inter and AC Milan.

Liverpool recently completed the signing of Dejan Lovren from Southampton - who, at £20million, is the most expensive defender in the club's illustrious history. The Croat is the third ex-Saints player to join Rodgers' men this season after Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana.

Upon joining the club, Lovren said: 'I played there last season in front of the crowd singing, "You'll Never Walk Alone". That is something very special for every player, every sportsman and every fan. I can't wait to get started.

'I'm a player that will give 100 per cent and I want to show that to the supporters because they deserve to see players who give 100 per cent. I know it is going to be something special to play in front of the fans at Anfield and I can't wait.'
