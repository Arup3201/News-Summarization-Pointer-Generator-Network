Three days of remembrance are being planned to mark the centenary of World War One, it was revealed today.

There will be a 'people's commemoration' of the key dates - the beginning of the conflict, the Battle of the Somme and Armistice Day.

Events are being planned for August 4, 2014 (the centenary of the day Britain entered the war), July 1, 2016 (100 years after the Battle of the Somme) and November 11, 2018 (the anniversary of the day the guns fell silent after four years of war).

The salute is being overseen by Prime Minister David Cameron who wants the tribute to focus on 'remembrance, youth and education.'

Instead of another sculpture or stone memorial, scholarships will be handed out as lasting legacy to the 'Great War' which claimed 16 million lives.

On the first day of the battle of the Somme, 20,000 British soldiers were lost.

The Imperial War Museum  is spending £35million on a refit of its World War One galleries.

It will play a 
leading part in orchestrating the many local projects throughout the country which will be the heart of the commemorations.

Tory MP Andrew Murrison, who is Mr Cameron's special representative on the commemorations told the Sun: 'The beauty of what is emerging in Britain is that it is rising up from the grass roots.'
