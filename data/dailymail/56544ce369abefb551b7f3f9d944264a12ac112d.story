Pictures of a terrifying supercell storm that hit New Mexico on Saturday were captured, depicting the awesome size of the monolithic stormclouds.

The storm rolled through Cuervo, New Mexico, producing hailstones that were four-inches in diameter. Cuervo is a community located approximately two hours away from Albuquerque.

The state issued tornado warnings for the area for the weekend, but this did not stop some adventurous photographers from capturing the event.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a supercell, which is not always a thunderstorm, is a weather phenomenon in which converging low level winds create an updraft which rotates on a vertical axis. This is also known as a mesocyclone.

Warm air in the mesocyclone can rise as fast as 170 miles per hour.

Supercells are known to create large hailstones, damaging winds, and tornadoes, and can last for hours if conditions permit.

These kind of storms can take place anywhere in the world, but are most commonly found in the midwest of the United States, as well as the plains areas in South America.

Forecasters are calling for more severe weather to hit regions of New Mexico and Texas on Sunday.
