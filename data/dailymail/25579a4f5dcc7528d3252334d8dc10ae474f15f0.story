The night before they disappeared and tried to cross the border into Canada, three Afghan soldiers went out to a Massachusetts strip club, where they ordered lap dances and tried to touch the women.

Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar went missing from Cape Cod on Saturday, where they were participating in a joint military exercise at Camp Edwards. 

Immigration officials arrested them two days later, on the New York-side of Niagara Falls, trying to make their way into Canada.

On Friday night, the three soldiers were part of a larger group that visited Zachary's Pub, a strip club in Mashpee. 

The group stayed at the club until early Saturday, and the bar's staff say they acted pretty normal. 

'They were nice, they tipped, they were very generous, they were sweet respectful,' dancer Melissa McNeely told WHDH.

'I ended up doing a lap dance for one of the guys and he stayed as still as a statue,' Ms McNeely added.

Hands off: Zachary's owner Richard Halpern says the group 'acted like everybody else' but didn't seem to understand that they could't touch the women

Free advertising: Halpern says the club has been getting a lot of attention no TV broadcasts because of the Afghan soldiers, which is good for business 

McNeely said the Afghan soldiers stood out because they looked foreign, but that it's not uncommon to get soldiers in the club due to its proximity to the military base. 

'We get military all the time' Zachary's owner Richard Halpern told Buzzfeed. 'We get people who can’t speak English all the time. It’s not anywhere out of the ordinary — they’re just typical people.'

Halpern said that the group 'acted like everybody else' but did face some challenges getting a handle of the strip club rules.

'From what I understand from some of the entertainers, they acted like they’ve never been in a place like this before,' Halpern added. 'They didn’t exactly know the rules and what’s going on.' 

He says some of them asked to touch the dancers, and they had to be told that it is illegal in the state of Massachusetts. 

Late Saturday, Halpern says he got a call from someone at the military base, asking if the three men were there.

'He said: "We’re missing three people. They didn’t show back up. Are they at your place?’"' Halpern recalled to the Boston Globe. 'Which I thought was very strange.'

Ms McNeely was also surprised when she saw the three men had been captured on Monday. 

However, their stop at the strip club appears to have helped in drumming up business for the Massachusetts bar. 

Halpern told Buzzfeed that several news stations have come out to do stories about the Afghan soldiers at his bar.   

'To get TV advertising and not take any money out of the advertising budget is always good,' Halpern said.

The three officers are currently in federal immigration custody in Batavia, NY and will likely be transported back to Afghanistan.

Before they were found Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said that they may have been seeking to defect to the United States.

The trio, who had been reported missing from Joint Base Cape Cod, were not considered a threat to the public, Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lieutenant Colonel James Sahady had said.
