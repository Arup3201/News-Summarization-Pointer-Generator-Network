PTA chairwoman Louise Daly, pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court, has been given a 12 month sentence suspended for two years after she stole thousands from her children's primary school

A PTA co-chairwoman, who stole nearly £20,000 from her boys' primary school, was handed a suspended prison sentence yesterday.

Louise Daly, 42, took thousands of pounds between September 26, 2012 and January 3 this year, after she was put in charge of the St. Joseph's Roman Catholic PTA's debit card.

The mother-of-two stole a total of £19,202 to help fund her household bills and husband's drinking problem, a court heard. None of the money has been recovered.

Daly's theft was only discovered after a new committee went through the PTA's finances and found thousands of pounds were missing.

Sentencing her to twelve months imprisonment, suspended for two years, Judge Douglas Moore told Daly she had 'brought  shame on your children and yourself'. 

The court heard she had been under pressure to cover bills and the rent and had begun stealing.

Prosecutor Philip Levy said Daly had been given a PTA debit card in the name of the previous co-chairperson when she was named a chairwoman at the organisation.

'The fraud came to light because she was struggling with the job and a new committee took over six months early and went through all the bank statements,' Mr Levy added.

'A lot of money had been taken out of the PTA account and revenue raised at various functions had been taken and not banked.' 

'There was no way this was not going to come to light and when interviewed Miss Daly was very upset and agreed to repay the money by instalments, but so far nothing has been received.'

Daly's lawyer Hugh O'Donohue claimed his client, who receives £2,300  sick pay and £800 from her partner every month, was in a 'black psychological hole.'

 'She was under pressure to pay day-to-day expenses and pay the rent,' he said. 'There are difficulties with her partner, who drinks two bottles of wine a night, and she dipped into the funds.

'She has not repeated her troubles to anybody, but it is obvious she needs counselling. She says there was a strain and she had not enough money from time to time so dipped into it.'

Daly took to the witness box to tell the court that she struggled to pay bills and that she was currently paying out  £20 for school dinners, their after school club was £50 per month; football training was £25 and she was paying the taxman £100 per month for a child tax credits overpayment.

'My partner would make me buy the alcohol,' added Daly, of Greenford Avenue, Ealing, who pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position with intent to make a gain. 'I thought I had taken about ten thousand.'

But Judge  Moore told Daly, a psychiatric nurse, there was no excuse for the 'despicable' offence and gave her the suspended sentence, as well as placing her on a two-year's probation and ordered her to pay £500 compensation within seven days and then £100 per month the PTA.

'It's a despicable offence, clearly an abuse of trust. These are children and you know these are difficult times.

'Most people would think you can get by on the £3,100 a month you had coming into the household without stealing £20,000 from a children's primary school.'

Judge Moore told Daly she had 'brought shame on your children and yourself' at Isleworth Crown Court yesterday

'You are a grown woman and knew what you were doing and the only person who has brought misery upon you is yourself. You are not the only person finding things difficult at the moment.

'You just can't turn around and blame everybody else, this was a blatant dishonesty and under normal circumstances you would go into custody, but there are young children here that would suffer.

'You have brought shame on your children and yourself. Nobody is quite sure where this money has gone and you have let people down.

'If the school wishes to take you to court to recover the debt they can. This will take twenty years to repay and that's not going to work. That's nonsensical.'

Remarkably, on the school's website is a message from the current PTA committee, which still states: 'We would like to thank the previous PTA team and Louise Daly for all their hard work and all their personal efforts and time they put into helping raise valuable funds towards school events and fundraising.'
