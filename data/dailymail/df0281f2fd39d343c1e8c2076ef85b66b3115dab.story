Abigail Harris, 12, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was on a family holiday when the driver mounted a pavement and ploughed into her in Gran Canaria

The family of a 12-year-old British schoolgirl who was killed in a hit-and-run crash on holiday in the Canary Islands have no idea whether the motorist was ever prosecuted.

Abigail Harris was celebrating her sister Jessica's 14th birthday with her family when the driver of a Ford Escort allegedly fell asleep at the wheel, mounted a pavement and ploughed into her in the resort of Puerto Rico in Gran Canaria.

The youngster, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, suffered multiple fatal injuries and died at the scene outside a shopping centre. Her stepbrother suffered a fractured collar bone and cuts to his feet which required 49 stitches.

However, Abigail's family have no idea whether the motorist has ever been prosecuted over the incident in April 2010, because Spanish authorities are refusing to hand over the information until they get a lawyer.

At an inquest in Bradford into the schoolgirl's death this week, the coroner ruled that she died as a result of unlawful killing.

The inquest heard how the incident occurred as Abigail, Jessica, their mother Nicola and her partner Keith Thackray and his son Thomas, 12, were nearing the end of their holiday.

In a statement, Mr Thackray said: 'We had been out horse riding and for a meal. On the way back to the apartment we needed some money. I parked the car next to a cash machine, off the side of the road.

'All five of us were walking toward the cash machine. As the group set out on foot Abigail was in the front nearest the road walking with Thomas.

'Jessica, Nicola and myself were directly behind. Then a car mounted the pavement nearly hitting Nicola, Jessica and myself. The car struck Abigail and Thomas and then veered back into the carriage way and sped off without stopping.

'After the impact I ran to Thomas and Nicola ran to Abigail. When I reached Thomas he was unconscious but breathing. He [had] careered through the air and landed against a parking bollard but after a minute or so he opened his eyes and was conscious.

'Abigail had been thrown into the air but not as far as Thomas. When I checked her she was breathing but unconscious and badly injured.'

The inquest heard how moments after the collision, the driver of the blue Escort drove away - despite having a badly cracked windscreen due to the force of the impact.

The car only returned to the scene when the occupants were followed and stopped by a taxi driver.

Mr Thackray said that once the car returned to the scene, a female got out and, in broken English, said 'I am so sorry, I am so sorry.'

An inquest in Bradford into the schoolgirl's death ruled she was killed unlawfully in Gran Canaria in April 2010

When police arrived Mr Thackray was asked to go back to his apartment to show officers their passports but he returned to his family to be told Abigail had passed away.

Mr Thackray said: 'In my view she was unlawfully killed by a driver who mounted the pavement in a ridiculous fashion and who had the audacity to drive off.'

Police later charged Jaime Noguera and his daughter Ingrid - who had no driving licence - with homicide due to negligence after conflicting reports over which one of them was driving the vehicle.

Both Noguera and his daughter were breathalysed but tests showed they had no alcohol in their systems.

In statement from Spanish Police, the investigating officer said there were discrepancies in the statements of eyewitnesses as to who was driving the Escort.

One witness saw a woman driving the vehicle - yet Noguera claimed he was driving the entire time.

He claimed he did not realise he had hit anyone despite a large crack on the front windscreen which would have obscured his vision.

Spanish police said: 'Two eyewitnesses said they could see that the person driving the vehicle was female. Two eyewitnesses said the vehicle was driving quite quickly at the moment of the accident.

Abigail's family do not know if those charged over the crash which killed her have ever been prosecuted because Spanish authorities won't hand over the information until the family hire a lawyer

'Two eyewitnesses also said that the person driving the vehicle returning to the scene was a male. All witnesses said the vehicle did not stop.'

A statement from Noguera said he had been driving at 40 kilometres per hour and added: 'He is sorry for what happened to the family of the victims. 

'He was driving with his daughter who was not driving and has never driven. He was looking for a pedestrian crossing.

'He thought he was distracted or fell asleep. He mounted the pavement and felt a hit on the front passenger side.

'He had not seen what he had hit. He carried on driving. His daughter told him she thought he had hit someone and that he should stop.'

His daughter insisted she wasn't driving as she does not have a driving licence. She said the pair were on their way home from the doctors and she hadn't realised her father was feeling unwell.

Her statement read: 'After hearing a loud sound and seeing someone on top of the car she made her father turn back. In turning around they saw the taxi driver. They returned to the scene and then they saw what was there.'

Coroner Oliver Longstaff recorded a verdict of unlawful killing at the inquest and said: 'This conclusion can come as no surprise to her family and no comfort to her family. 

'You have lived with these difficult events for four and a half years now.

'The Spanish justice system will not reveal the outcome to the deceased's next of kin. 

'The only way to find out is through the intervention of lawyers. It is up to the family whether to obtain it. When this is not done the Spanish will not budge hence the delay that has occurred.'

Mr Longstaff also offered his condolences to the family and told them 'nothing said can do anything to bring her back'.

He added: 'If this is any consolation, I am entirely satisfied that Abigail was utterly unaware of what was going on. How as a family you move on from this I don't know. I never hope to find out.

'I offer you my personal sympathy for these catastrophic events that you have had to live with. It may be in time it may be easier to remember her as you would want to remember her.'
