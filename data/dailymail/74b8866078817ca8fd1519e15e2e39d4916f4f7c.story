A British boy killed in the Swiss coach disaster was known as ‘the little cherub’, his former headmistress revealed yesterday.

Sebastian Bowles, 12, had told his family that he was having a ‘really great’ holiday and could ‘already ski quite well’.

Just two days later he was one of 22 children from a Belgian school killed when their coach crashed as they returned home. The two drivers and four teachers on board were also killed.

Swiss investigators yesterday said they believed the coach had clipped a kerb before veering into a lay-by which led to a solid brick wall.

They added there was no evidence the 
driver was changing a DVD at the time, as had been feared, and there was
no evidence either of the drivers were intoxicated or tired.

They are however examining whether the angle of the tunnel wall contributed to the severity of the crash on Wednesday.

Sebastian had moved with his family to Belgium two years ago so they could be closer to the relatives of his mother Ann.

He
had been a popular pupil at Our Lady of Muswell Catholic Primary in 
London and was remembered there with a minute’s silence yesterday.

Headmistress
Teresa McBride said: ‘He was a wonderfully vibrant boy who is so fondly
remembered by pupils, staff and parents at Our Lady of Muswell.

‘He was known by staff as “the little cherub”.

'He will be greatly missed.’

Sebastian’s mother had been a governor at the school two miles from their former home in Crouch End, North London.

Speaking outside the school Miss 
McBride added: ‘Sebastian was a smiling, bubbling boy who looked like an
angel and he was an angel.

'We are all struggling to deal with this.’

Sebastian
had posted an online message to his parents reassuring them he was 
having a great time at the Alpine resort of Val d’Anniviers just 48 
hours before his death.

With the joy of a child enjoying his 
first taste of freedom, Sebastian tells his parents and his sister 
Helena about his adventures ski-ing and eating a barbecue on the slopes.

He had written: ‘Dearest Mama, Papa, Helena and Flopsy. I can already ski quite well. It’s really great here.’

The schoolboy adds: ‘After breakfast we had a lovely walk and the teacher told us a story about the area.

‘Then we went ski-ing and ate a 
barbecue on the slopes.

'That was great.

'We could eat as much soup and 
hotdogs as we wanted ... mmmmmmmm jummmmie.’

Sebastian’s
father Edward, who is regional head of public affairs for the Standard 
Chartered Bank, and his Belgian mother Ann had travelled to Switzerland 
to identify their son’s body.

They
had returned to Belgium yesterday but the shutters were down at their 
detached house on the outskirts of Leuven, near  Brussels.

A neighbour 
said: ‘He was such a fantastic, polite boy.

'He always said hello. It’s 
such a  shocking thing.’

Both Sebastian and his sister  attended St Lambertus School in Heverlee, two miles from their home, where Belgian flags were draped from windows in the neighbourhood as a mark of respect.

One of the three children fighting for their lives after the accident came out of a coma yesterday. 

Medics said the girl, who had  suffered a spinal cord injury, was fully conscious and able to interact with her parents at her  bedside.

The other two girls remain in induced comas.

Belgium came to a standstill  yesterday as the remains of the 22 children – aged 11 to 13 – and six adults killed in the crash were flown home.

The bodies, with the children in white coffins, were returned to Melsbroek military airport near Brussels in two army planes where 28 hearses were  waiting for them.

Before the 11am silence Elio Di Rupo, the Belgian Prime Minister said: ‘The whole country weeps for its children.’
