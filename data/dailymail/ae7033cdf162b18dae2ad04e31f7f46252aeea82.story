George Osborne's 3p-a-litre rise in fuel duty planned for January could lead to 35,000 job losses, according to a study.

The increase will cost the average family an extra £60 a year in petrol costs and could also see a 0.1 per cent cut in economic growth, the report prepared for the FairFuelUK group shows.

Campaigners will present the report, which claims a fall in household spending will lead to lower national income and the loss of about 35,000 jobs, to the Treasury today.

As a result of the predicted job losses and damage to growth, the tax hike would only bring in just over half the expected extra tax revenue - £800million rather than £1.5billion, it said.

The study, produced by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, said cutting fuel duty by 3p instead of raising it by 3p would create 70,000 new jobs and boost growth by 0.2 per cent.

It added that the 6p relative difference between the two options would normally have been estimated to have lost the Treasury about £3billion.

However, because of the boost to the UK economy, that loss of revenue is much less - at £1.8billion.

FairFuelUK will present the report when its leaders meet Treasury officials in London this afternoon.

Warning: George Osborne has been told that raising fuel duty by 3p will lead to 35,000 job losses

Speaking before the meeting, Quentin Willson, national spokesman for FairFuelUK, said he believed Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander understood the problems faced by motorists.

Mr Willson said: 'We have always argued that fuel duty shouldn't be the Treasury's sacred cash cow - it should be used as a lever for growth.

'And we've proved our argument with robust financial research and modelling that shows if you raise duty you destroy jobs and damage growth.

'Danny Alexander understands this critical point and is one of the few politicians who's actually listening to the facts and engaging with our argument.

'We appreciate the Government's aspiration to reduce the deficit but know that hiking fuel duty up by 3p in January will only make things much worse.'

A Treasury spokesman said: 'It is right that the Treasury engages with FairFuelUK to discuss technical issues around the impact of the cost of fuel on the economy.

'What matters to motorists and businesses is that fuel is now 10p a litre lower than under the previous Government's plans. This Government has done more to support motorists and businesses than any other.'
