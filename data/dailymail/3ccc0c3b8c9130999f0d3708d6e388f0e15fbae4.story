New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio's approval rating took a major hit on Wednesday among the friends and family members of the 265 people who tragically lost their lives as a result of the crash of Flight 587.

De Blasio, who is notoriously tardy, showed up 20 minutes late for the commemorative ceremony, missing the moment of silence and ringing of the bell that happens every year at 9:17am to mark the exact time the tragedy occurred on November 12, 2001.

Making matters even worse, he blamed the fog for keeping him from arriving on time.

Tardy: Mayor Bill De Blasio (above) showed up 20 minutes late to a ceremony commemorating those who lost their lives due to the crash of Flight 587

Ringing the bell: De Blasio missed the annual moment of silence and ringing of the bell which happens every year at 9:17am, the exact moment the tragedy occurred 

Grieving families: Those in attendance were incredibly upset that de Blasio arrived to the event so late, which he blamed on the fog

'Mayor de Blasio traveled to the ceremony by boat this morning and the boat was delayed due to heavy fog,' a statement from the mayor's office said. 

'The Mayor regrets missing the tolling of the bell, but was glad to have an opportunity to mark this solemn day with the families of those lost on Flight 587, who have the continued support of this administration.'

Those at the ceremony were enraged, and let De Blasio know just that after he gave his remarks.

Miriam Estrella, who lost 5 family members in the crash, said she confronted De Blasio, and that he 'didn't really apologize.'

Letting him have it: After the ceremony, some of the family members and friends of the victim confronted the mayor

Lost lives:All 260 people on the plane and five on the ground were killed in the 2001 crash

Remembering: To mark the fifth anniversary a memorial was constructed to the victims (above) and each year the ceremony is held there

She also told DNA Info, 'Every year Mayor [Michael] Bloomberg is here on time ready to go. He’s here 30 minutes (before) socializing with the family members, giving us all the support.'

'And this year [Mayor Bill de Blasio] came a lot of minutes late. 9:16 is the time that our family members passed away. We’re supposed to toll the bell. We’re not supposed to wait for him to toll the bell.'

Twitter user @KianaFaith was even more upset, writing, '13 years today w. Out my mother in my life , at the memorial && this fu**ing Duma** mayor bill de blasio , is showing up late . Kill urself.' 

De Blasio was scheduled to give remarks at 9:05am and arrived at 9:25am, almost 10 minutes after the moment of silence. 

This is not the first time De Blasio has been late for a major event, with this actually being the norm for the decreasingly popular politician. 

Later in the day, De Blasio elaborated on why he was late, saying, 'I just woke up in the middle of the night, couldn’t get back to sleep and felt really sluggish and off-kilter this morning.' 

Crash site: Flight 587 went down in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens shortly after takeoff

 The crash occurred exactly two months and one day after two planes hit and took down the Twin Towers

Very angry: A woman who lost her mother shared how upset she was on Twitter

Flight 587 was travelling from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Las Américas International Airport in the Dominican Republic when it crashed shortly after takeoff in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens on November 12, 2001.

All 260 people aboard were killed, along with five on the ground. 

The crash happened exactly two months and one day after the 9/11 tragedy. 

A memorial was constructed in Rockaway Park, Queens to commemorate the crash on its fifth anniversary, and every year a ceremony is held on November 12, with Mayor Bloomberg having attended every year until now when he served as the city's mayor - and never once arriving late.
