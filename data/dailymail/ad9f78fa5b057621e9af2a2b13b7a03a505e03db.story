Prepare to be amazed by this incredible aerial footage filmed by a homemade drone in Washington state.

The video was created by Will Good and Gabriel Ng, two cinematographers based in Las Vegas.

The founders of 2 Guys Creative undertook a month-long project to capture the stunning vistas of the United States' Pacific Coast.

Hello there: Will Good and Gabriel Ng constructed this DIY drone, the DJI Phantom 2, in their home

The video begins with the two men putting together the drone - the DJI Phantom 2 - itself. 

Drones are remotely-piloted aircraft - but don't get this homemade fare confused with military grade UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) or RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems).

These DIY creations are about the size of a remote controlled helicopter, but unlike toy planes, you don't need a lot of knowledge to control them.

They even have the capacity to fly a pre-programmed flight path, customisable through a programme known as 'electronics prototyping software.'

Aspiring videographers can then attach their cameras to the drone to ascertain footage from an otherwise impossible to reach position.

Good and Ng took their project to all new heights, navigating their little drone above seemingly never-ending forests, along the majestic coastline, and even hundreds of feet above one couple's special day.

Say cheese! The camera even managed to capture this couple's special day

Green with envy! The drone captured footage of thousands of fir trees as far as the eye can see
