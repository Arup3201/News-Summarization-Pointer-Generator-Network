News presenter Lincoln Humphries has said the video of him declining to take the ice bucket challege earlier this week was a private video that was never supposed to be made public.

The original clip showed Mr Humphries, on the set of WIN news, declining to partake in the ice challenge and urging viewers to ‘stop wasting ice’ and donate to charities helping areas with water shortages instead.

Lincoln Humphries featured featured in a viral video earlier this week in which he declined to partake in the icechallenge and urged viewers to 'stop wasting ice'

The video went viral, clocking over 1.6 million views and sparking a torrent of media attention.  Mr Humphries received a barrage of negative comments on his Facebook page, to which he responded with a post that read:

‘My message was one of absolute positivity and support for some of the charities which I hold most dear. I apologise without reserve if anyone drew any offence from my comments, he said.

But in a new video which aired last night on Nine news, Mr Humphries says that ‘unfortunately  a couple of media outlets have ran the line that I since apologised for the video.’

Humphries said in a Facebook post he ' apologises without reserve if anyone drew any offence from my comments,' but that he 'stands by the message,'

Mr Humphries says the original clip 'went viral beyond my intentions and beyond my control'

Mr Humphries goes on to say ‘The only error of judgement on my part was the use of WIN materials and resources to make what was an absolutely personal statement.’

‘I made a video and posted it to my own personal wall. I want to make it very very clear this was never intended to go to air.'

Mr Humphries says ‘It went viral beyond my intentions and beyond my control.'

'I stand by the message of people doing what they can for whoever they can do it for 100 per cent, because that's what I've believed all my life and I will continue to do so.'
