England insist they have followed the latest concussion protocol after selecting Courtney Lawes and Dylan Hartley to face South Africa a week after both suffered blows to the head against the All Blacks.

Northampton lock Lawes was forced to leave the field in the first half of the 24-21 defeat in the QBE series opener against the world champions with an angry, egg-shaped swelling around his left temple.

Despite failing a pitch-side test to determine whether he was concussed, the 25-year-old has been passed fit after subsequent examinations and procedures.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster insists England have followed the latest concussion protocol

Under previous guidelines, Lawes and Hartley would have faced a mandatory three-week rest period after being diagnosed with concussion. Now they are preparing for a high-intensity contest just seven days later but England head coach Stuart Lancaster is adamant that players’ welfare is being protected.

He said: ‘The whole process has been ratified at the highest level and we’ve got to trust the process. Certainly from my dealings with Courtney this week, he’s been symptom-free from Sunday.

‘He’s gone through the graduated return — cycling, running, non-contact skills — and he’s ticked every box. So it’s pretty comprehensive. He and I and the medical team and everyone feel very happy that he’s ready to play.’

Asked to confirm that Lawes was not involved in any training early in the week, Lancaster added: ‘He wasn’t involved in contact training. I can’t remember that. I’ll need to check the tape. I don’t remember him being involved in any training. He basically stood in the line-out. He wasn’t involved in Tuesday training.’

Lawes is satisfied that his long-term health had been given due consideration before he was selected to face the Boks. ‘As a player, you’ve always got to think of your well-being, especially when you’ve got a family,’ he said.

‘But at the same time, you know you are in good hands. I knew that the England doctor was not going to let me play if I wasn’t right.

‘I didn’t get knocked out and concussed as badly as I have done in the past. In the past, I’ve had a bit of memory loss. At the weekend, I didn’t have any memory loss. I had a big egg on my head, which was quite painful, and I failed the numbers test. They give you four numbers that you have to repeat in reverse order, then five and six.

‘I didn’t really have any symptoms, other than a splitting headache after I got hit in the head. The next day I woke up and felt fine. There weren’t any symptoms, other than a distorted face! To be honest I’ve never had symptoms the day after a game.

'When you’ve been knocked out you’re unable to remember much that has happened in the game. It’s a bit like you’re dreaming.’

As expected, England have promoted Bath wing Anthony Watson to the starting XV in place of the injured Semesa Rokoduguni, with Marland Yarde added to the bench. Tom Wood had been a slight injury doubt but he was cleared to play in the back row.

Watson has long been a favourite of World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward and Lancaster said: ‘Anthony has been pushing hard for a while and has been in impressive form for Bath and in training with us. It was great that he got on against New Zealand and we feel he is ready to start.’
