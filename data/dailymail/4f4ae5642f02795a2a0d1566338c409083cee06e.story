Louis van Gaal has refused to be drawn into any mind games with Jose Mourinho as his Manchester United side prepare to do battle with Chelsea this season.

The Dutchman knows Mourinho well from mentoring him at Barcelona, but insists he won't react to any wind-ups from the Portuguese.

Asked if he was looking forward to facing old pal Mourinho, Van Gaal said: 'No. I play against Chelsea. And not against Jose Mourinho. My team and his team are playing against each other.'

New rivals: Man United boss Louis van Gaal will come head-to-head with Jose Mourinho

But be warned, Louis, Mourinho drags everyone in eventually.

Since his arrival on English shores in 2004, the Portuguese has dragged players, referees and opposition managers into his web of mind-games.

And he didn't let his guard slip after returning to Chelsea last summer, either.

Already the Blues boss has aimed a first swipe at his old mentor, suggesting United overpaid for teen sensation Luke Shaw.

Van Gaal remained ice cool: 'No. I’m not reacting to that kind of stuff.'

He'd be the first. Here, Sportsmail looks at Mourinho's war of words with top bosses throughout his time in England.

Arsene Wenger

Mourinho’s trading of verbal blows with the Arsenal boss dates back to August 2005, when Wenger claimed that Chelsea’s defensive tactics were putting 'the sport in danger'.

The Portuguese responded by calling Wenger a 'voyeur' and, since then, a never-ending battle has taken place between the pair.

Last season proved no exception, with the Frenchman being labelled a 'specialist in failure' by the Special One before Wenger had another blast at the Chelsea manager over the transfer of Juan Mata to Manchester United. A feud set to rumble on.

Mourinho on Wenger: 'He is what you call in England a voyeur. He is someone who likes to watch other people. There are some guys who, when they are at home, have this big telescope to look into the homes of other people and see what is happening. Wenger must be one of them… it’s a sickness.'

Wenger on Mourinho: 'He’s out of order, disconnected with reality and disrespectful. When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes.'

Rafa Benitez

The relationship between Jose and Benitez has fluctuated over the years, with the two ‘good friends’ at one point and blasting each other at others.

Once Chelsea won the Premier League title in 2005 and again a year later, the war of words began, with Benitez questioning whether the Blues really were one of the best sides in world football.

Mourinho responded by mocking the Spaniard’s relative lack of success, asking the press 'how many championships has Benitez won,' before answering with 'none'. 

The row remains ongoing, with Benitez recently claiming to want no association with the Chelsea manager, because of his 'crossing [of] the line of sportsmanship.'

Mourinho on Benitez (upon leaving Inter in 2010 with the Spaniard replacing him): 'One thing is for certain, Benitez won’t do better than me.'

Benitez on Mourinho: 'I like to talk about facts. At Liverpool, we eliminated his Chelsea from the Champions League with a team that cost half as much as his side. With the most expensive squad at Real Madrid, he did nothing in the Champions League.'

Feud rating: 7/10 - Bubbling away.

Sir Alex Ferguson

Mourinho’s relationship with the retired Manchester United manager has perhaps never been the one football fans would have expected.

The pair have remained good friends, often sharing their footballing secrets with each other, as well as discussing players and tactics. 

The Portuguese tactician has said, very simply that the two men 'trust each other' and that he knew of Sir Alex’s retirement long before the news was broken.

In return, Mourinho informed Ferguson of his return to Chelsea. The pair have traded harsher blows at times, with the Scot complaining about Mourinho’s 'personal crusade' against him.

Jose also had to patch up their relationship after berating Ferguson for pressurising the referee at half-time during a Carling Cup semi-final.

Mourinho is said to have cried when not approached to succeed Ferguson, having been convinced, says journalist Diego Torres, by a 'friendship of genuine trust'.

Mourinho on Ferguson: 'He was unique, absolutely unique. The number of trophies he won for Manchester United in English football is absolutely amazing.'

Ferguson on Mourinho: 'Jose understands winning and losing are twins in a way. When you win you don’t gloat and when you lose you don’t go bananas.'

Feud rating: 3/10 - Friendly with the occasionally harsh mind-games.

Manuel Pellegrini

There is little love lost between Mourinho and the current Manchester City manager.

The rivalry dates back to the pair’s time in Spain, with Mourinho, succeeding the Chilean as manager of Real Madrid, claiming Pellegrini’s second place finish the previous season made Real 'the first loser'.

Bitterness has lingered ever since and has now been transferred to the Premier League. Mourinho leaping into the Stamford Bridge crowd after a late winner against City last year, followed by a refusal to shake hands, did not help matters, but Pellegrini ultimately had the final word by capturing the Premier League crown.

Mourinho on Pellegrini: 'Second place is just the first loser. If Madrid were to fire me, I wouldn’t go to Malaga. I’d go to a top-level team in Serie A or the Premier League.'

Pellegrini on Mourinho: 'I didn’t expect anything else [from him]. I don’t like coaches who are only interested in results. The concepts of spectacle and creativity are fundamental to me.'

Feud rating: 6/10 - A rivalry which keeps threatening to ignite. Mourinho keeps fuelling the fire, Pellegrini tries to keep out of it.

Roberto Mancini

Mourinho created hostility between himself and the Italian upon his succession at Inter Milan.

The Portuguese later claimed Mancini left him with little more than a 'five-a-side team' and the now Galatasaray manager responded by saying the comments were born out of jealousy.

Mourinho is said to have turned down the invitation of Mancini to join him for dinner after Chelsea’s champions League tie with Galatasaray last season, keeping tensions high between the two men.

Mourinho on Mancini: 'I won’t have a meal with somebody [Mancini] who has the same job as I do and the only thing we have in common is the fact we’re both football managers. I have no interest.'

Mancini on Mourinho: 'When I went to Inter they played very bad football and we changed this. He took a team that I had built.'

Feud rating: 7/10 - Not the greatest of friends.

Andre Villas-Boas

The young Portuguese manager worked closely under Mourinho at Chelsea and Inter Milan, before a spectacular fall-out between the two after Villas-Boas left to become a coach himself, having apparently not informed Mourinho of his unhappiness in a lesser role.

The former has since claimed he does not even have Jose’s phone number and their relationship has remained frosty ever since.

The rivalry eased somewhat after Villas-Boas was sacked by Tottenham late last year, with Mourinho calling his former protégé to console him and remind him that “another job will come.”

Mourinho on Villas-Boas: 'I don’t care what he says. I’m not here to do that. I’m not interested.'

Villas-Boas on Mourinho: 'We had a great personal and professional relationship before. We don’t have that now.'

Feud rating: 5/10 - A bad fall out but the ice is thawing slowly.

Alan Pardew

The Newcastle manager is another with whom Mourinho enjoys a largely friendly relationship.

Jose voiced his support for Pardew after the latter was banned for headbutting Hull’s David Meyler in March this year, saying he 'spoke with Alan' just a couple of hours after the incident took place.

Pardew, in return, praised Mourinho’s tactics and influence. Whilst Jose was with Real Madrid, Pardew was full of praise for him, calling him a 'big manager' and suggesting that his 'impact cannot be lost on my education'.

Mourinho on Pardew: 'He is a good friend and a great guy.'

Pardew on Mourinho: 'There were things I was seeing [from Mourinho] that I hadn’t seen in English football before. Some of the managerial traits he was bringing I’ve learned from. And I can’t help but say I’ve nicked a few of them!'

Feud rating: 1/10 - A genuine friendship.

Sam Allardyce

Jose and Big Sam have relatively little history between them, which is understandable considering Mourinho’s view that he would never want to fight the West Ham manager, who would in his words 'kill me'.

The last Premier League campaign did see a war of words however, with the pair trading blows at their respective press conferences after a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge.

Mourinho on Allardyce’s tactics: 'It’s very difficult to play a football match where only one team wants to play. This is football from the nineteenth Century.'

Allardyce on Mourinho: 'I don’t give a s***e to be honest…we’ve out-tacticed him, outwitted him.'

Feud rating: 4/10 - A spat which could continue into next season.
