Well, it certainly beats chasing your tail.

A dog owner has captured the excitement of his pet corgi as he bounds tirelessly around on a playground roundabout.

The video of Meatball the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has become an internet sensation since owner Carter Grebbien posted it online.

The cute video shows Carter spinning the carousel - built by his father in the backyard, in Boston,  America - as his pet runs in the opposite direction barking loudly for every revolution. 

The five-year-old dog even appears to be using the roundabout like a canine treadmill or hamster wheel and throws in a few 'stunts' for good measure, leaping over his owner's legs as he excitedly runs for more than four minutes.

He shows no signs of tiring and seems to be enjoying his run so much that the fun only ends when his owner stops the wheel.

Grebbien wrote that the dog has always been 'quirky' and brings plenty of laughs to he and his family.

The video was filmed in 2011, but has only become viral now since it was recently posted online.
