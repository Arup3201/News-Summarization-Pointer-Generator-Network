Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins has warned potential suitors for Wilfried Bony they will have to spend big to land the striker.

Chelsea are understood to have scouted the prolific Ivorian in Monday’s 4-1 defeat at Liverpool, but Jenkins insists he has received no approach for his star man.

Bony’s camp have previously stated the 26-year-old’s desire to play for a top-four side and his status as the leading Premier League scorer in 2014 has drawn serious interest.

But Jenkins told Sportsmail on Wednesday that neither he nor the club has been contacted by a rival for the player, who is understood to be valued close to £30million.

He said: ‘There has been no enquiry to me or the club about Wilfried Bony.’

Bony’s haul of 20 goals in the calendar year surpasses any other striker in the top flight.

Monk said earlier this month that it would take an ‘astronomical’ offer for anyone to land the striker, who has netted 33 goals since joining Swansea for an initial £12m fee in 2013.

Jenkins added: ‘We are in the same position as any other club. Things are as they are. No one wants to lose players and if you are to lose players it has to be for the right offer.

'Bigger clubs than us have to deal with that – it’s the nature of football these days. We are realistic about that.

‘It’s important to remember we are talking about a player who has scored more goals in 2014 than any other, including people who cost a lot of money.’

Bony is expected to feature against QPR on Thursday night, but will then join up with the Ivory Coast for the African Cup of Nations.

Swansea’s hopes of him returning to south Wales from Africa are helped by the contract extension Bony signed last month.

Significantly, the extension, which ties Bony to the club until June 2018, addressed the release clause in his initial deal, which is believed to have been set at £19m – a potential bargain for an interested rival, but a clause that would have meant Swansea making next to no profit if someone had triggered it.

Liverpool were the most interested in the summer, but are understood to have been put off when they learned what the striker would expect in wages.

City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain and head scout Gary Worthington were both in attendance for Monday’s clash, while Chelsea’s chief European scout, Mick Doherty,was also in the stands.

Swansea have already signed forward Nelson Oliveira on loan from Benfica to cope with Bony’s Cup of Nations absence and have also agreed a deal for Exeter midfielder Matt Grimes.

‘We have done a lot of our January work already,’ Jenkins said. ‘We have signed Nelson Oliveira and we are signing Matt Grimes and that covers our main priorities. Whatever else happens, happens.’
