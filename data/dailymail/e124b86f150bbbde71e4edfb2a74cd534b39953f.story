Cinderella's wardrobe may be brimming with ornate glass slippers but it's her classic hour-glass figure women are lusting after. 

The new Disney film, starring British actress Lily James in the title role, has helped spur on a revival of the shape-shifting garment according to The Sunday Times. 

The new trailer for the rags-to-riches fairy tale sees 25-year-old Lily flaunt an enviably tiny waist thanks to the help of an icy-blue corset dress complete with floor-skimming puffball skirt.

One leading retailer of the traditional, steel-boned women's corsets, What Katie Did, has seen sales of the garment grow by 50 per cent in the past three months. 

While online auction website eBay has reported sales of the more modern corset rise by 54 per cent since December. 

Esher-born Lily, who is dating former Doctor Who star Matt Smith, 32, recently hit back at claims that movie makers had digitally altered her figure. 

She says her minuscule waist is achieved by wearing an ultra-constricting corset and by consuming a liquid diet.

Lily told E! News: 'When [the corset] was on we would be on continuous days, so we wouldn't stop for lunch or a lovely tea —you'd be sort of eating on the move. 

'In that case, I couldn't untie the corset. So if you ate food it didn't really digest properly and I'd be burping all afternoon in and it was just really sort of unpleasant. 

'I'd have soup so that I could still eat but it wouldn't get stuck.'

But it's not just on the big screen where corsets are making a comeback. 

The restricting bodice, which helps boost breasts, banish muffin top and slim the tum, has featured on the catwalks of Stella McCartney and Alexander Wang this season.

Fellow singer Kylie Minogue has been stunning onstage in a scarlet bodice during her current Kiss Me Once tour, which touched down in Perth, Australia last night.

Founder of What Katie Did, Katie Thomas, told The Sunday Times that the corset revival is all about female empowerment.

'It's more about being confident, powerful and being in control while looking good as well,' she said. 

'It has absolutely nothing to do with men at all.' 

Katie, whose clients include the supermodel Kate Moss, says the Jessica Rabbit-type body shape is back in fashion.'Suddenly we've got Kim Kardashian on the scene with her tiny waist and big hips - it's amazing to have someone with that kind of figure be popular again - she's allowing us girls with curves to get back in there a bit.'

Never ones to miss a trend, Kardashian sisters Kim, Kourtney and Khloe have all turned to corsets in order to slim down.

The celebrity-approved craze is known as waist training and involves completely modifying your figure and posture by restricting it. 

Trim-tum seekers must wear the corset for short periods of time, gradually increasing use to achieve desired results. Some people even sleep in it.

However, health experts have warned of the dangers. 

Mary Jane Minkin, clinical professor of ob-gyn at Yale School of Medicine, told Women's Health:  

'Medically, it doesn’t make sense that cinching your waist tightly will make it permanently smaller.

'Once you take the garment off, your body will return to its usual shape. 

'It’s also uncomfortable, restricts your movements, and if you wear it really tight, it can even make it difficult to breathe and theoretically could cause rib damage.'
