An amorous boat captain who had left the helm to have a drunken three-way sex escapade caused a minor security scare at New York's La Guardia Airport on Sunday.

Craig Gallo, 51, crashed his boat into the runway lights of the busy hub after descending below deck with James Benenato, 60, and Mary Ann Belson, 60.

Galo was charged by the NYPD's Harbor Unit with operating a boat under the influence and Belson was taken to hospital to be trated for a possible broken nose and jaw. Benenato suffered no physical injuries.

The distracted threesome met in a bar in College Point, Queens and neither of the two men had ever met Belson before.

Staggeringly, the boat was left impaled on the stanchion for 30 minutes before the Port Authority arrived to investigate.

A spokesman for the PA Police Department admitted that security had been breached.

He said if those aboard the boat had been 'terrorists with bad intentions, they could have easily succeeded.

'If they had hand-held rockets, they would have had plenty of time to fire at planes.'

However, there were no patrols on that night because the PA Police Department has decided that evening patrols would go in a round of cost cutting measures.

'The boats were purchased with federal money. They are not being deployed 24-7 — as the public would expect them to be,' said Paul Nunziato of the PAPD union.

Gallo, who lives in New Jersey and is an employee of a financial firm on Long Island was in his boat when it crashed at the end of Runway 22.

Indeed, police said that the three were lucky that the boat did not sink, especially as it took police 30 minutes to get to them.

A spokesman for the PAPD said that before the smash, 'a consensual three-way sex endeavor was going on.

'There’s a moral here: If you’re feeling amorous aboard a boat, I suggest you drop your anchor before you drop your pants.’
