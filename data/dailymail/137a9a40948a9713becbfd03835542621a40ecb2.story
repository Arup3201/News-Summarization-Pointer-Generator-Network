Seven people are dead after a boy climbed into a well to retrieve a coin worth just 45 pence - and six others who tried to rescue him succumbed to oxygen starvation.

The 11-year old who slid into the well on a bamboo pole in a village in the Banteay Srei district was the first to lapse into unconsciousness and die - and today the tragic series of events that led to their deaths was revealed by police.

Acting district police chief Muy Nan told the Cambodia Daily that the tragedy began when 50-year-old father Tuy Chen accidentally dropped a 3,000 riel coin and his lighter into his well while drawing up water.

Desperate to find the coin because of his poverty, he used the bamboo pole to slide down but while he recovered his lighter he did not find the coin which was too valuable to lose.

'The father was safe when he climbed back,' said Mr Nan. 'What no-one realised was that in the morning and night oxygen exists in the well, but there is none there in the evening when this occurred.'

The police officer said that unaware of the air changes in the well, Mr Chen's 11-year-old son Che Aun descended down the pole in the early evening hoping to have better luck than his father in finding the coin.

When he failed to surface, his two sisters, Che Kea, 13, and Che Ratana,15, went in after him, setting off a chain of doomed rescue attempts.

Hay Chandy, 12, and his brother Hay Sangda, 20, went in after the sisters, followed by Chhem Sokhy, 15, and Teab Puon, 32, said the Cambodia Daily.

Only the final person to descend, Soy Peam, 27, survived - but even he was rushed unconscious to hospital..

The incident happened late last night in a remote area of the north western province of Siem Reap (pictured) when an 11-year-old boy and six other people went into the well to collect 3,000 riel (45p)

Police, who said the tragedy was played out in less than an hour, did not explain how the survivor was rescued.

'We tested the well by tying a chicken to a rope and lowering it down,' said commune police chief Phon Pheap.

'After a few minutes, the chicken was unconscioius. The people died because there was no oxygen in the well.

Village chief Daung Check said the family of Mr Chen was extremely poor.

'They are so poor that they don't have enough rice to eat,' he said.

Despite the death of three of his children, he and his wife will continue to struggle on with their remaining eight children, said the authorities.

The bodies were brought up from the well by villagers using a rope.

Police said the process took several hours as the rope had to be tied around the bodies one by one.

Scientists have told the Phnom Penh Post that at oxygen levels between four and six per cent humans fall into a coma within 40 seconds, followed by convulsions and then death.  Above ground, oxygen levels are normally about 21 per cent.

Che Chhan, a 30-year-old sister of the three siblings who died, blamed her family's poverty for the tragic series of events.

 'My 11-year-old brother knew that my father had lost 3,000 riel in the well and he wanted to get it back without thinking it would be dangerous. And now so many people have died like this,' she told the Post.

I wanted to blame my father because if he did not tell them about the money they would not have died But it's over now.

They would not come back if I blamed my father.

'But the villagers blame my father and say he was careless.'

The seven victims have been cremated in the village - and the well is to be destroyed.
