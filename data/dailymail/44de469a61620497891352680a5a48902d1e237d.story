Devin M. Gesell, 17, from St. Charles, is accused of breaking into the home in November

Three teen burglars stole ashes after mistaking them for cocaine - and only realized after they tasted them.

Devin M. Gesell, 17, is accused of breaking into the home in St Peter’s, Missouri,  in November with two others - a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old who can not be named for legal reasons.

The trio thought they had come across a stash of cocaine and took it from the house along with a necklace worth $500, a Xbox 360 game system,  bottles of prescription drugs oxycodone and morphine, and over $800 in cash, reports the St. Louis Post- Dispatch.

But when they tasted the ashes, which were in a wooden box, they realized their mistake - and threw the homeowner's father's ashes out of the car. 

Gessel later told the police they could not remember where they threw them out so police have not been able to retrieve them. 

According to police, the three knew the family who lived at the home and planned the burglary after seeing a Facebook post which indicated they were going to be away.

But they were caught after police tracked them through an IP address used on the Xbox.

Gesell was charged this week with burglary and two counts of theft.

He told police he acted as lookout as the other two went through the house after breaking in through the back door. 

His bail is set at $10,000 cash-only.

His accomplices, ages 15 and 16, were referred to juvenile authorities for charges.   

Debora Matthews, the victim of the robbery told Kmov.com: 'I just couldn't believe that they would take the ashes.'

'But you know, they were kids and I guess just stupid.'
