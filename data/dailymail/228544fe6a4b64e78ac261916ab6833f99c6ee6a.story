One of the stars of TLC's hit series My 600lb Life, who lost more than half his body weight, is working to put his life back together and meet someone special following the failure of his second marriage.  

During a special one-off episode of the TLC show, which aired last night, viewers were given a chance to see how Chuck Turner's incredible 433lb weight loss has changed his life as he prepares to 'get out there' and go on his first blind date since splitting with his second wife Nissa.

When viewers first met the 46-year-old from Beaumont, Texas, his 693lb frame and immobility were frustrating Nissa, who felt his vast size made their marriage akin to a carer-patient relationship and prohibited him from taking care of their adopted son Nathan.

Moving forward: After losing more than 400lbs, Chuck Turner, 46, shared his incredible story with his church congregation, which has been a 'source of strength' following his split from his second wife Nissa

Chuck, who began rapidly gaining weight after the murder of his first wife in 2006, became so large, that a 40lb lymphedema, a lump caused by a build-up of fluid, had appeared on his leg. 

'Back when I was heavy I couldn't move around," he explained on last night's episode. 'I couldn't function the way I needed to because of the weight. I was too heavy to do my job, so I used to rely on my [tow truck] competitors to help me.'

After having gastric bypass surgery in 2013, Chuck has gotten down to 260lbs and the huge lump on his leg is gone.

Although his marriage to Nissa was unable to be saved, he is once again able to meet the physical demands of his job and climb on his truck's flatbed - something he could never do when he was massively obese. 

Second chance: The 46-year-old from Beaumont, Texas said the members of his church remind him he has a lot to look forward to. He also revealed that his friend is going to set him up a blind date as he continues to rebuild his life

Fitness test: On last night's episode of the TLC show, Chuck showed viewers that after losing 433lbs, he is once again able to meet the physical demands of his tow truck business

He noted that he is even looking to hire more employees and expand his business, something he never would 'have dreamed' a year ago.

'I know Nissa felt like I was too big to take care of my family and do what I needed to do,' he said, 'so it means a lot to me to be able to do my job like I should.'

Chuck explained that he is also trying to rebuild his life outside of work 'a little bit at a time', which includes attending church regularly.

He said his church has been 'another inspiration' and a 'source of strength' during his journey.

During the episode, Chuck shared his story with members of the congregation.  

Hard times: When Chuck was nearly 700lbs (right) he relied on his business's competitors to help him tow cars because he size left him practically immobile 

Massive concern: Before losing more than half of his body weight, Chuck had a 25lb lymphedema, a lump caused by a build-up of fluid, on his leg

Love lost: When viewers first met Chuck, his 693lb frame was putting a strain on his marriage to his second wife Nissa and he was unable to play with their adopted son Nathan

'The people in my church never condemn me,' he said. 'All they did was support me and pray for me.'

He explained that the additional support showed him that 'there is a lot to be thankful for'.

'There is a lot to look forward to,' he said. A friend of mine wants to set me up on a blind date. I am looking forward to getting out there and meeting someone, but right now I am going to focus on making more progress.'

Chuck, who will be meeting with his doctor soon, noted that he wants 'to keep moving in the right direction.'  

'It's been hard recently, but I know there has to be something good waiting for me after all this hard work,' he added. 'I got to have faith in that and keep moving.'
