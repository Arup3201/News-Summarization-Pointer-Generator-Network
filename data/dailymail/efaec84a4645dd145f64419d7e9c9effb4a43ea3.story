Michael Wyatt had no artistic skills until he had surgery to remove a benign tumour from his pituitary gland

An IT sales director who had a brain tumour says surgery to remove it has mysteriously turned him into an artist.

Until six months ago, Michael Wyatt, 47, had no artistic skills, but he claims a brain tumour on his pituitary gland caused him to develop a creative flair.

Mr Wyatt, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said that since waking up from surgery to remove the tumour in January, he has felt ‘compelled’ to draw, paint and share his artwork with the rest of the world.

His prints were immediately sought after by a London design buyer who decided to print them on T-shirts to be sold in shops including Next.

Mr Wyatt said he believes the pictures were his 'subconscious revealed to him while under anaesthetic' and added that it was the ‘good thing’ to come out of having the brain tumour.

The married father-of-two said his journey from salesman to artist began in December, when he was talking to a friend at his gym about some health issues.

After some internet research he thought he might have a low testosterone and made an appointment with his doctor who at first told him it was ‘extremely rare’.

Mr Wyatt said: ‘But he sent off some blood for tests anyway and said I was right  - I did have low testosterone. I was sent me off for a MRI scan immediately.

‘They found a benign tumour on my pituitary gland and it was taken out within the week.’

While he was under anaesthetic, Mr Wyatt had vivid dreams which he believes were his subconscious being revealed to him. These visions now shape his artwork

His work has now been displayed and sold around the country and is to feature printed on tee-shirts. Mr Wyatt has also been given a clean bill of health

It was during his return to consciousness that he had the kaleidoscopic visions that inspired his artwork.

‘I had really, really vivid dreams like 
going through a colourful tunnel. I didn’t think anything of it and had 
to take five weeks off before going back to work, he recalls.

‘Then one night I couldn’t asleep and went downstairs and started drawing.

‘I drew for three hours and filled an A4 page and by the time I had finished, I had an A5 sized very detailed picture.

‘I showed some family and friends who really liked it and I feel compelled to show other people.’

Mr Wyatt is now exhibiting in his home town while still working in IT.
