The BBC has announced the launch of a 'pay-to-keep' download service which will give viewers access to older and previously unavailable shows.

'Project Barcelona' will connect the BBC archives to the Internet, allowing viewers to pay a 'relatively modest' fee to download older classics.

The rumoured price for a TV show is about £2, which could then be kept forever on a computer hard drive.

Catch-up TV: The success of iPlayer has inspired the BBC to open up the archives so that long-hidden classics can be seen again

The project means shows which have never seen the light of the day 
since their first run may finally be available to a nostalgic audience.

Many older shows, for instance from the 1980s and 1990s, retain a 
loyal following, but without enough demand to warrant a DVD release, 
there is currently no way of making them available to the public.

BBC director general Mark Thompson announced the proposals at the Royal Television Show in London, and asked UK producers to give their support.

He said: 'a large proportion of what the BBC makes and broadcasts is never seen or heard of again.

'The idea behind Barcelona is simple. It is that, for as much of our content as possible, in addition to the existing iPlayer window, another download-to-own window would open soon after transmission - so that if you wanted to purchase a digital copy of a programme to own and keep, you could pay what would generally be a relatively modest charge for doing so'.

Thompson called the scheme the 'digital 
equivalent' of buying a DVD, and suggested other streaming or Web TV 
services might be able to buy or licence the content.

He said: 'It's the exact analogy of going into a high street shop to buy a DVD or, before that, a VHS cassette.

In the 1960s and 1970s, most shows 
were broadcast once and never seen again. Indeed tapes were often wiped 
or re-used, meaning a lot of material, like early Doctor Who episodes, 
are lost forever or only exist in audio format.

If
 shows were 'repeated', it would normally be by getting the actors to 
reprise their characters, as casting agencies were anxious that repeats 
would reduce the demand for actors.

But
 as time went on, the cultural value of TV began to be recognised and 
the BBC began storing broadcasts for posterity.

'For decades the British public has understood the distinction between watching Dad's Army on BBC1 and then going out to buy a permanent copy of it. Barcelona is the digital equivalent of doing the second.'

In order to tempt content providers over to Barcelona, the BBC will give them a little more cash - 40p per episode, compared to, for instance, the 28p offered by iTunes.

While Thompson said the project would provide additional funding for independent productions, he denied accusations it was a 'second licence fee by stealth'.

Internet streaming has taken off in a big way in the last few years, spearheaded by services such as iPlayer.

Most operators, such as Sky, Channel 
4, and ITV also offer limited streaming services for free, although it 
is likely that many services will try to profit from their operations 
over time.

Meanwhile big players in the market 
such as Lovefilm, Netflix and Apple's iTunes are pushing TV and movie 
streaming globally, and most services are available across a wide range 
of distribution channels, such as on the web, on video consoles like the
 Xbox 360, and through set-top boxes.

Daleks from 1963: Many early episodes of Doctor Who are unavailable to the wider public, but iPlayer-style digitisation may once again offer older shows to a modern audience

The BBC officially launched iPlayer in 2007, and quickly became a hit.

While iPlayer drew some criticism from some commercial content providers for offering the service for free, it has drawn a great reaction from viewers who can catch up with shows for up to a week after broadcast.

It has also helped provide niche shows with an expanded audience, and helps the BBC assess get a better picture of ratings of shows.

Two of the BBC's biggest shows from the last few years, Doctor Who and Sherlock, both spearheaded by writer Steven Moffat, regularly pick up millions of extra viewers via iPlayer.

Criticisms of the service generally relate to the unavailability of the service overseas due to licencing issues.
