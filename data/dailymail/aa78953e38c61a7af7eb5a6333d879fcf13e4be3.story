The SNP are on course to more than double their vote share in Scotland at the next general election, potentially stripping 31 seats from the Labour Party.

The swing could see Labour reduced to just 10 MPs in their traditional heartland of Scotland, and could put Downing Street out of Ed Miliband's reach. 

Buoyed by the recent independence campaign, Nicola Sturgeon's party are predicted to take 43 per cent of the vote next May, compared with just 20 per cent in 2010.

Meanwhile support for Labour would be decimated, falling from 42 per cent at the last Westminster election to just 26 per cent.

Nicola Sturgeon could see the SNP double its vote share at the next general election, returning 45 MPs to Westminster, and almost wiping Labour off the political map

Such a dramatic shift in Scotland's political landscape would be a bitter blow to new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, who has vowed to retain every on of Labour's seats, and an embarrassment to beleaguered Ed Miliband.

The new poll, conducted by ICM for the Guardian, could prove disastrous for Mr Miliband's hopes of becoming Prime Minister, even if Ukip succeeds in splitting the Tory vote in the rest of the country.

Most alarmingly for Labour, further analysis of the poll by Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, suggests it could lose some fortress seats that it has held since the 1920s.

When the seats are broken down into categories and analysed individually, rather than as an overall trend, virtually every Labour seat in Scotland is at risk, he added.  

David Cameron's party are set to drop from 16 per cent to 13 per cent voter share in Scotland, though they will still retain the single seat they hold north of the border, according to ICM.

The Lib Dems are looking at another collapse in voter confidence in 2015, falling from 19 per cent at the last general election to 6 per cent.

Mirroring the political change taking place throughout the UK, both Ukip and the Greens are on course for gains, with Nigel Farage's party picking up seven per cent of the votes, and the Greens finishing on four per cent.

Labour could be reduced from 41 MPs to just ten while the SNP would gain a crushing majority according to a new poll released today

The SNP, then lead by Alex Salmond, returned just six MPs at the last general election but could take 45 of Scotland's 59 constituencies if current trends continue.

The findings echo those of recent research by Survation for the Daily Record, which found that 48 per cent of voters would back the SNP with Labour trailing on 24 per cent.

Issues on which the SNP were strong was the right for Scotland to set its own corporation tax, which is currently set in London, where 53 per cent felt the power should be devolved.

The poll also showed that 43 per cent thought the Trident nuclear deterrent should be scrapped, another issue on which the SNP campaigns. 

On the issue of the Smith Commission, which was set up after the independence vote to recommend powers to hand over to Holyrood, 30 per cent of Scots thought its proposals did not go far enough, while 26 per cent though it got the balance right. 

Jenny Marra MSP, Scottish Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said the recent election of new leader Jim Murphy heralded a 'fresh start' for the party.

She said:  'We will come back in the New Year with passion and energy, setting out our vision for making Scotland the fairest nation on earth.

'We want the wealthiest Scots to pay a little bit more in tax so we can improve our NHS and give the poorest kids being let down by the SNP government in Edinburgh a better start in life.

The disastrous prediction would be a bitter blow to Jim Murphy (left), the new Scottish Labour leader who has publicly vowed to hold every 2010 seat, and may put Number 10 beyond the reach of Ed Miliband

'The choice facing Scots next May is clear - we can send SNP MPs to the House of Commons to protest against the Tories, or we can send Scottish Labour MPs to replace the Tories.

'The only way to remove David Cameron from Downing Street and return a UK Labour Government is to vote Labour.'

Angus Robertson MP, SNP general election campaign director, said:  'This is another very encouraging poll for the SNP, on top of the Survation poll showing the party on a record high.

'While these polls are extremely welcome, we take absolutely nothing for granted - and the hard work begins in the New Year to ensure that Scotland's voice is heard at Westminster.

'This is the second poll in a week showing that Jim Murphy has experienced a 'reverse honeymoon' as Scottish Labour leader, with Labour trailing far behind the SNP.

'It will take more than a change of leader to turn around the fortunes of a party paying the price for a toxic alliance with the Tories.

'More and more people are putting their trust in the SNP to stand up for Scotland's interests, and ensure that Westminster delivers the powers needed to strengthen and grow the Scottish economy and create a fairer society.'
