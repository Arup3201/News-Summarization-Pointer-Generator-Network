Katy Perry has become the most followed person on micro-blogging site Twitter after amassing 46,529,319 followers

Singer Katy Perry has overtaken Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter.

The 29-year-old star now has 46,529,319 subscribers to her account compared to Bieber's 46,507,82. 

Teen heartthrob Bieber, 19, had held the number one spot since January, following was not quite big enoguhto beat  Russell Brand’s ex-wife Perry, who also has 58million Facebook fans.

In third place was Lady Gaga with 40,400,759 subscribers. The outrageous singer held the Twitter crown for three years before Bieber who took over in January.

President Barack Obama was the only non-musician in the top five with more than 39million followers, and Taylor Swift came in fifth place with 36million.

Katy Perry’s recent link to a member of One Direction may have attracted the extra attention on social media. Niall Horan, 20, jokingly proposed to Perry on Twitter last month.

She recently said she had learned ‘how to tame that social media dragon’ and advised users: 'When you decide to have a glass of wine, put the phone down.

'Don't drink and tweet. Don't be self-indulgent. Don't use it just to promote yourself. That's boring.' she said in a recent interview with USA Today.

Perry’s manager Martin Kirkup regards social media as a perfect platform for the cheerful, friendly extrovert.

‘For
 Katy, who has always been about making connections with fans, the 
social networks are a huge advantage,' he said. 

‘I often say that Katy 
was born on the Internet. She’s taken the fullest advantage of the 
wonderful world of greater connectivity.’ 

But Perry still sits in second place in Facebook popularity, with 59.25 million likes to Lady Gaga’s 60.35 million.

It’s a far cry from 2009 when actor 
Ashton Kutcher won a battle with singer Britney Spears to hold the first
 Twitter account with more than one million followers.

The 
microblogging network, which has yet to turn a profit, has amassed 230 
million users in seven years, including heads of state, celebrities and 
activists.

About half of all US adult Twitter users said they get news 
through the social media platform, according to a Pew Research survey.

Twitter shares are expected to rise in value after they begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow.

Though it is the best known Silicon Valley 
company to go public since Facebook, the company is seeking a far smaller 
valuation of up to £8.4 billion compared to Facebook’s £62 billion.

Twitter’s IPO is already said to be ‘massively’ 
oversubscribed and underwriters are looking to select investors who plan
 to hold the stock for a longer duration rather than traders wanting to 
do a quick flip.
