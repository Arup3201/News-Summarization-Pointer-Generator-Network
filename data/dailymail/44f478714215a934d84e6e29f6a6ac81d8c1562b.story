A nine-year-old girl has reportedly been flown out of Australia to be married in the Middle East.

The Immigrant Women’s Health Service, based in western Sydney, claims it learned about the case on Sunday but has no more details. 

It spoke to the girl's mother after receiving a tip-off, the ABC reports.

Dr Eman Sharobeem, director of the Immigrant Women's Health Service, warned that the government is not doing enough to prevent young girls from being married off illegally.

She said its strategy to stop child brides would fail because the girls don’t want to implicate their families in the crime.

She reasoned: ‘I don't hope and wish to see parents behind bars ... I already tried with many of them to talk about informing the authorities, and as soon as I put that on the table the girls actually turn their back and say “we're not even going to have a conversation with you”.’

Dr  Sharobeem was forced to be a child bride while she was 14 and living in Egypt.

'It's not secret within our communities. It’s maybe secret to the eyes of the rest of the Australian community,' she told 60 Minutes earlier this year. 

Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan told the ABC: ‘We're very keen to ... make sure that if somebody is to come across this type of crime that they know how to go about helping that person to report it to authorities so we can do something about it.’ 

Minister for Women Pru Goward said parents needed to know it was illegal to take their child overseas for a forced marriage.

'Certainly the person who "married" the girl can be prosecuted and it is just an unacceptable part of life in Australia,' she told Macquarie Radio on Tuesday.

In October, in an unrelated case, a 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court on Thursday to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence

The latest case comes as the federal government launches an awareness campaign to encourage young women to report child marriages.

'We're making sure that we have materials out there to educate the community about what to look for and so these crimes can be reported and then the appropriate authorities can go and prosecute them,' Mr Keenan said.

But Dr Sharobeem, said brochures would have little effect.

'Forced marriage and child brides happen among the culturally and linguistically diverse communities, those communities will not go to the website and will not share glossy papers to see what's written about legislation in the country,' she said.

There are currently 70 million child brides in the world. The National Children’s and Youth Law Centre has identified approximately 250 child marriages in Australia over the last two years but many more cases are thought to have gone unreported.

In countries like Yemen, Bangladesh and Nigeria, marrying daughters off has been done for generations but in Australia the practice is often used to control children's behaviour, for family businesses, or to meet perceived community expectations.

Australia has laws in place to protect children:

In October, a man accused of 'marrying' and having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old girl, pleaded guilty to ongoing child sex abuse.

The 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court  to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence.

The charge takes in 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14, with which the man was originally charged.

He has been ordered not to contact his victim for two years, and a date for sentencing will be decided next week.

Police allege the man married the Hunter Valley girl in an Islamic ceremony earlier this year.

The girl's father will face trial next year. 

The father, who is in his 60s, allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'.

He has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14.
