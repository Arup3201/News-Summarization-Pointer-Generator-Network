The Mexican top football division the Liga MX is in the early stages of the current campaign but is certainly sparking into life.

Morelia forward Yorleys Mena provided a priceless moment in the dying embers of their draw with bottom side Leon by tripping over onto the ball.

The 23-year-old tried to catch the Leon defence on the counter attack deep into second-half stoppage time to be the hero and earn Morelia’s first win of the season.

However as he burst down the right wing it did not go to plan. Instead of finding the killer pass or clinical finish, the unfortunate striker tripped himself up before bouncing off the ball as the chance for a victory disappeared, leaving Moreila one place above Leon at the foot of the table.

Also in the Liga MX, Santos Laguna striker Diego Gonzlez called upon a new celebration on the way to a 4-1 victory.

Gonzalez scored the opening goal in his side’s emphatic victory over Monterrey before taking off his boot to pretend to use it as a phone in a bizarre celebration involving a ball boy as Santos Laguna claimed their first victory of the season.
