Meryl Streep led a chorus of stars honoring the Indian woman whose brutal rape and subsequent death has inspired a documentary so harrowing it has been banned by the Indian government.

Streep spoke at the New York City premiere of India's Daughter, a BBC program which tells the story of Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old medical student who was set upon by six rapists as she rode a bus in 2012.

Singh was injured so badly after the repeated, violent rapes that she later died in hospital. Indian ministers secured a court order banning the documentary in India, for fear it could stoke public anger.

Streep told a packed auditorium at Baruch College in Gramercy, Manhattan, that Singh is not only India's daughter, but 'our daughter, too'.

She was joined by Coldplay singer Chris Martin, Dakota Fanning and Indian actress Frieda Pinto. The documentary was directed by British filmmaker Leslee Udwin, herself a rape victim.

The hour-long film, which has aired in Britain already, sparked uproar for including comments from one of Singh's rapists.

Mukesh Singh told film crews: 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes.

He is one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the medical student, who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in December 2012.

Once inside, bus driver Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager launched the attack.

The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death.

Protests: Thousands of Indians took to the streets after Singh's death in protest at her brutal violation

Outrageous: Mukesh Singh, one of Jyoti Singh's six rapists, told film crews that the rape was her fault

She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines.

Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape.

However, Mukesh Singh argued that Jyoti Singh's death was her fault for struggling.

He said: 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after 'doing her', and only hit [her friend] the boy.'

Grief-stricken: Pictured are Badrinath Singh and his wife, Asha Devi, the parents of Jyoti Singh. Badrinath said the documentary shows the 'bitter truth' about Indian culture

He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two... A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night.'

A defense lawyer for the six rapists also weighed in. AP Singh said that if his daughter or sister 'engaged in pre-marital activities... in front of my entire family, I would put petrol on her and set her alight'.

The victim's father, Badrinath Singh speaking to broadcaster NDTV, which was set to screen the film before the ban, said the documentary is 'the bitter truth' and deserves to be seen by every Indian.
