Mulayam Singh, leader of India's third biggest political party, has pledged to repeal the death penalty for rape claiming 'men make mistakes'

The leader of India's third biggest political party  has sparked fury as tens of millions vote in the country's national election, by promising to scrap the recently-introduced death penalty for rape claiming 'men make mistakes, why hang them?'

Mulayam Singh, leader of the Samjawadi Party, said he would repeal the law introduced in response to public outrage over a fatal gang rape in New Delhi in 2012.

Addressing a rally in Moradabad, in the key state of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam said: 'Rape accused should not be hanged. Men make mistakes.

'Efforts will be made to change such a law, so that those misusing it are punished. Those filing false reports will also be taken to task'

Yadav, whose party pledges to represent 'other backward classes' said relationships between 'boys and girls' often break up.

He added: 'If boys and girls have difference, and the girl goes and gives a statement that I have been raped, then the poor fellows are punished.

'Two or three have been given the death sentence in Mumbai.

'We will change such laws when we come to power ... we will also ensure punishment of those who report false cases.'

Rival politicians were quick to condemn his comments, and back the new law.

In a statement the Indian National Congress said: 'We condemn Mulayam Singh's statement. There should be zero tolerance for rape and crime against women,'

Other Backward Class (OBC) is a term used in India to describe castes or social groups which are educationally and socially disadvantaged, accounting for around 40 per cent of the population.

Mulayam Singh served as Minister of Defence between 1996 and 1998 in the coalition United Front government and was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh between 2003 and 2007.

Tens of millions of Indians cast their votes across India's key heartland states with some pollsters predicting a record turnout. 

Nearly 110 million people were eligible to vote in the third phase of the elections in 92 constituencies in 11 of India's 28 states and three federally administered union territories.

Suspected Maoist rebels, who have urged a boycott, briefly disrupted voting in their strongholds in eastern Bihar state and neighboring Chattisgarh, killed two soldiers in a bomb attack.

Hours before the voting began, insurgents blew up a jeep carrying the paramilitary soldiers, killing two and wounding three others and causing a suspension in voting in some parts of eastern Bihar state, police said.

The soldiers were patrolling a forest in a rebel stronghold in Munger district when their jeep hit a land mine nearly 145 miles southeast of Patna, the state capital, police officer Jitendra Rana said.

Voting was suspended at 20 nearby polling stations because of the safety threat, Rana said, but started as scheduled in other parts of Bihar state.

Election authorities are expected to hold voting in the area targeted by the rebels on another day.

The insurgents struck again hours later and briefly disrupted voting in neighboring Chhattisgarh state by firing at security forces guarding 10 polling stations in Bastar district, the Press Trust of India news agency said.

There were no casualties and the rebels fled after security forces returned fire, PTI said. The voting resumed after security forces combed the area.

The multiphase voting across the country runs until May 12, with results for the 543-seat lower house of Parliament announced May 16.

The heartland states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Haryana, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra states are essential to the main opposition Hindu nationalist party's bid to end the 10-year rule of Congress party.

The main Hindu opposition, with strong momentum on promises of a surge in economic growth, appears to be leading the race to end the Congress party's 10 years in power.

Sonia Gandhi, the governing Congress party chief, and her son Rahul Gandhi, the party's vice president, voted in the Indian capital where their party was routed in a regional election in December.

Besides the Congress party and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, the vote is also crucial for the future of India's anti-corruption party, led by Arvind Kejriwal.

The Aam Admi Party, or Common Man's Party, scored a stunning upset in the New Delhi election, launching Kejriwal to the national stage.

He has led protests and hunger strikes to highlight his fight against government corruption over the past two years. The party is contesting nearly 400 parliamentary seats.

The threat of insurgent attacks is always a shadow over Indian elections, although voting in the northeast on Monday and Wednesday was mainly peaceful.

On Wednesday, Maoist rebels killed three soldiers in a gunbattle in Chhattisgarh state a day before voting started.

In March, rebels killed 15 government soldiers and one civilian in their deadliest raid in Chhattisgarh in almost a year, ambushing dozens of troops and police guarding construction workers.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has called the rebels India's biggest internal security threat. They operate in 20 of India's 28 states and have thousands of fighters, according to the Home Ministry.
