A grieving mother is pleading for the return of her stolen pendant - which contain's her son's ashes.

Gaynor Augustine, 63, was left devastated when she realised her home had been burgled on October 10 and the cruel thieves took her necklace.

Her son Spencer Carter died at the age of 43 last year after suffering a heart attack, and Gaynor had the pendant made especially as a unique reminder of him.

Gaynor Augustine is pleading with burglars to return a pendant which was stolen from her home in Kent as it contains the remains of her son Spencer Carter, who died of a heart attack last year aged just 43

She is pleading with whoever stole the hear-shaped necklace to come forward and return it, as she says the jewellery is 'irreplaceable'.

Mrs Augustine, of Cuxton, Kent, said: 'I watched the jeweller put Spencer's ashes in it.

'It took him over an hour to do and the pendant was sealed afterwards, so no one will know the ashes are in there if they sell it.

'They are my son's ashes and thinking of them being around the neck of someone else is just so upsetting.

'I came home at about 9.10pm and could see a light shining in the kitchen so I think I disturbed them and when I got inside I discovered I'd been burgled.

'The pendant is irreplaceable and I just want it back. I am hoping someone will do the decent thing and hand it in.'

Kent Police say they are investigating the burglary.

DC Craig Hewitt, of Kent Police, said: 'This was one of two burglaries in the area that night, and the woman victim in this case was particularly upset because the pendant contained her son's ashes.

'We have carried out inquiries in the local area, and my colleagues have visited a number of second-hand stores and pawnbrokers in case the item has been put up for sale.'
