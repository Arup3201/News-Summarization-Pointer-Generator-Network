Terrified dogs ripped out their claws in fear after a large fireworks display took place near an animal rescue centre.

Workers at Birmingham Dogs Home were met with blood-spattered cages after a night of loud explosions.

In a desperate attempt to escape
 what they perceived to be outdoor turmoil, the panic-stricken rescue animals had inadvertently
 injured themselves with lost claws, cuts and bruises.

Blood-spattered: Workers at Birmingham Dogs Home were greeted with blood-spattered cages after a night of loud explosions

Injured: The cages were covered in blood as the distressed dogs tried to find their way out but damaged themselves in the process

Birmingham Dogs Home manager Darren Calveley claimed the explosions were so loud he likened them to 'being in a war zone.'

The dog pictured is now wagging his tail again, but is very fearful of type of sudden noise. 

He is also limping on his paw which had the claws ripped out.

Traumatised: This scared dog is now wagging his tail again, but is very fearful of any kind of sudden noise. He is also limping on his paw which was the one that he pulled out his claws

Recovering: Now the fireworks are over, he is still nervy but getting over his injuries

The centre is concerned that witnesses 
observed partygoers holding on to rockets deliberately until the last 
minute so that they exploded seconds after release, causing louder 
blasts.

Mr Calveley said: 'The explosions
 were horrendous and far more excessive than the legal 120 decibel 
level. Such was the severity of the noise, that car alarms were going 
off.  I could have believed I was in a war zone'.

They are now making a plea for people to consider animals by reducing the decibel factor as with the festive period approaching they fear the dogs may be further injured.

A spokesman for the charity insisted the dogs were not left alone during the evening.

He said: 'The Home Manager and Assistant Manager actually live on site and other staff were available that evening and spent the whole period going around attempting to calm all of the dogs.

'Radios were also on throughout the home to help dumb down the noise. It should be noted that there were 117 dogs in our kennels that evening.'
