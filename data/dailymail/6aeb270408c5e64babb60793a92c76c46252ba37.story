At least five Los Angeles police officers are being investigated in connection to the death of a 35-year-old mother of two who was allegedly stomped and kicked in the genitals during an arrest last month, police said on Friday.

Alesia Thomas was found not breathing in the back of a patrol car after resisting arrest in an incident that was captured on a dashboard camera. 

‘I take all in-custody death investigations very seriously and directed the officers involved be removed from field duties until further details are known, including what part intoxicants and physical conditions contributed,’ LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said. ‘I’m confident we will get to the truth, no matter where that leads us.’

Tragic: Alesia Thomas, a 35-year-old mother of two, died in police custody after being allegedly stomped on and kicked by officers

The incident took place on the morning of July 22 after two children aged three and 12 were abandoned at the LAPD’s Southeast Station, police said, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Commander Bob Green, who is in charge of the Southeast Area station, told the Los Angeles Times that Thomas tried to surrender custody of the children to police because she was a drug addict and felt she could not care for them

Following an investigation, officers had determined that Thomas was the kids’ mother.

Officials arrived at her home in the 9000 block of South Broadway and briefly questioned her, after which they proceeded to arrest her on suspicion of child endangerment.

According to police and eyewitnesses, the 35-year-old, who was described as a large woman, began ‘actively resisting arrest.’ In an effort to subdue her, one of the officers performed a leg sweep and knocked her off her feet, while two others handcuffed Thomas behind her back, the LAPD said.

According to KTLA, one of the cops told Thomas, ‘get your fat a** in the car.’ A female officer then threatened to kick her in the genitals and then made good on her threat, Commander Green later confirmed.

The official account, however, made no mention of the female officer's questionable treatment of Thomas.

The still struggling woman was placed into the back of a patrol car. Officers then reportedly tied her ankles with a strap known as a ‘hobble restrained device’ and propped her up into a seating position.

A dashboard camera video reportedly shows the woman breathing shallowly before drawing her last breath.

A few minutes later, the officers noticed that the mother of two stopped breathing and called for Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics. Thomas was rushed to a hospital, where she died shortly after.

It is unclear whether the cops 
attempted to resuscitate her and how much time elapsed before first 
responders arrived on the scene.

Neighbor Gerald McCrary Sr said he did not see the arresting officers mistreat Thomas, and described her as being aggressive.

The cops attempted to calm the woman 
down and even brought her a glass of water, but Thomas was thrashing 
about and even broke free from a pair of plastic handcuffs, according to
McCrary.

‘My heart hurts. I can't walk anymore,’ he recalled Thomas telling police.

The
neighbour said the woman was shaking her head against the seat 
inside the police car. Shortly after, McCrary saw Thomas lying on the 
sidewalk without her shirt.

The LAPD is planning to hold a press conference on Saturday, and may release the dashboard camera video that captured the incident.

The revelations come just days after the release of a shocking video that shows two Los Angeles police officers body-slamming Michelle Jordan, a 34-year-old mother and registered nurse, for talking on her cell phone.

The brutal arrest was captured by a surveillance camera after the officers followed her car into a Del Taco restaurant parking lot in the Tujunga area on August 11.

Both officers - one with 22 years of service, the other a probationary officer with 10 months experience - have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.

Witness: Raymond Branch said, although the woman should have been arrested, they went 'overboard'

Earlier this month, 20-year-old skateboarder Ronald Weekley Jr. was tackled and pinned to the ground outside his Venice home, in an arrest that was caught on a mobile phone. An internal investigation has been launched into the arrest.

On Monday, Deutsche Bank executive Brian Mulligan filed a $50 million lawsuit against the department, claiming two officers held him captive and beat him on May 15.
