Soft sentences: Judge Gareth Hawkesworth jailed a serial paedophile for just five and a half years

The judge who let a teenage rapist off with a community order handed another soft sentence to a paedophile who preyed on girls as young as five for 36 years, it has been revealed.

Judge Gareth Hawkesworth provoked outrage  last week for failing to jail a 14-year-old boy found guilty of raping a girl of four who he was babysitting.

Instead he imposed a three-year community order after blaming ‘the world and society’ for his exposure to internet porn.

Now it has been revealed that in April this year Judge Hawkesworth jailed a 59-year-old man for just five and a half years despite hearing how he had preyed on six girls aged five to 13 from 1974 until 2010.

The pervert, a married man from Hertfordshire, was convicted of nine charges of indecent assault and gross indecency despite each charge carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years to life.

After reading about the 14-year-old, one of the man's victims reportedly told the Sun newspaper: 'My heart goes out to the family of the little girl involved in the case with Judge Hawkesworth.

'I too was involved as witness and victim at a sex offender’s trial.

'Along with other victims, I was shocked at the short, soft sentence that the man received and the trauma left to me and all victims involved.

'This man has been at it for over 30 years. It’s destroyed my family. The whole process that we have been through has been soul-destroying.

'I am just starting to rebuild my life and move forward. I want to know whether Judge Hawkesworth will now be investigated.'

Last week, the 14-year-old defendant wore his school uniform in the dock as Judge Hawkesworth told him he would have received a six-and-a-half year jail term if he had been an adult.

He said: ‘You have not shown any 
particular sexual interest in children. I’m satisfied it was impulsive 
and I believe you have become sexualised by your exposure to and the 
corruption of pornography.

‘Your exposure at such a young age has ended in tragedy. It was the fault of the world and society.’

The schoolboy, who cannot be named for
legal reasons, attacked his victim in December after being paid £10 to 
take care of the girl, who lived in a neighbouring house near Cambridge.

Devastating: The young girl, who was raped by a 14-year-old boy, with her parents

He was interviewed by police and 
revealed he had regularly accessed porn on the internet at his parents’ 
home without their knowledge. In court he admitted raping a girl under 
13.

Julia Flanagan, defending, said it was
a one-off incident and no threat or force was used. She added: ‘We have
a very frightened and remorseful boy who is very ashamed of what he has
done.

'He knows it will follow him for the rest of his life.

'He is marked to some as a sexual deviant for ever.’

The victim’s father told the court he was concerned about the long-term psychological damage she will suffer.

The boy will have to register his address with police for the next two-and-a-half years.

A sexual offences prevention order was
also made for five years, meaning he must not access pornography of any
kind and cannot use mobile phones or computers without suitable filters
to prevent viewing pornography.

The case has fuelled demands for stricter controls to be put in place to stop children accessing online porn

The Daily Mail is calling for an 
automatic block under which adult content would be filtered out by 
default. Users would have to opt in to see it.
