Gary Glitter has appeared at crown court accused of plying a schoolgirl with alcohol so he could have sex with her.

The former pop star faces a string of charges relating to alleged sex offences against two under-age girls in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The 70-year-old sat in the dock at London’s Southwark Crown Court but struggled to hear through a hearing loop as he was asked by the court clerk to confirm his name.

Difficulty hearing: Glitter, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court in London today, was asked for confirm his real name - Paul Gadd - but struggled to understand

Addressing the former singer, who appeared in court under his real name Paul Gadd, Judge Alistair McCreath asked: 'Mr Gadd, can you hear me now?'

Glitter replied: 'I’m sorry, I can’t.'

The judge said: 'It sounded like you just did.

'We wanted to know if you were Paul Gadd but we know who you are.'

Looking tanned and sporting a white goatee beard, Glitter was allowed to leave the dock and sit behind his defence barrister for the rest of the hearing.

He sat with his hands cupping his ears as the court heard a plea and case management hearing would take place on August 20.

Dressed in a dark pin-striped suit with a black polka dot handkerchief, blue stripped jumper, black scarf and wearing glasses, Glitter removed his black fedora hat for the hearing.

He also took off a pair of tinted glasses after being told to wear 'normal spectacles' for the hearing when he appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court earlier this month.

Glitter, from Marylebone in central London, is accused of eight charges, with six relating to one girl and two to another.

He is accused of four counts of indecent assault against the first alleged victim, who was aged 12 or 13 at the time, between January 1977 and December that year.

Glitter is accused of administering a drug - 'namely alcohol' - with the intention to 'stupefy or overpower' the girl to enable him to have sex with her between January and May 1977.

He also faces one charge of unlawful intercourse with a girl aged under 13 between the same dates.

The former singer, who was released on bail, is accused of another two counts of indecent assault against a second complainant, who was aged 13 or 14 at the time, between October 1979 and December 1980.
