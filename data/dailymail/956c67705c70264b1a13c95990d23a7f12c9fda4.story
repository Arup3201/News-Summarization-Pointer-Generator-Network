This little beetle has really got this dog bugged out.

Alex Schwartz filmed his pet Pit Bull coming face-to-face with a  ladybird for the first time.

The canine is seen barking at the tiny insect as it crawls over the bed. 

Its frustration mounts as the winged bug takes flight and buzzes its wings.

At one point the dog aggressively paws the ladybird in a bid to catch it.

However, the resilient creature manages to survive the attack and continues on its way.

After more than two minutes the ladybird disappears.

The Pit Bull is seen sniffing around for its pal with no joy.

'Where did the big scary bug go?' a woman watching the incident says in an American accent. 

Hopefully the ladybird managed to escape back to its natural habitat, out of harm's way.
