Resignation: Executive director Greg Smith has
 quit Goldman Sachs in a letter in the New York Times, claiming it cares
 more 
about money than clients

The scathing resignation letter that a Goldman Sachs executive published this morning has become an internet sensation.

Either reviled by the perceived 'toxic and destructive' behavior of investment bankers or the audacity of the veteran employee to lambast his firm in such a public fashion, the letter has spanned the web throughout the day.

The letter was written by Greg Smith, an executive director who has worked at the New York-based investment bank for 12 years, and detailed what he felt was the company's moral decline during his tenure.

Published in the op-ed pages of The New York Times, the letter was bound to garner attention no matter what.

The fact that he included specific grievances only helped to fan the flame of Wall Street-bashing.

'I can honestly say that the environment now is as toxic and destructive as I have ever seen it,' writes Smith, who headed the firm's U.S. equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

'To put the problem in the simplest terms, the interests of the client continue to be side-lined in the way the firm operates and thinks about making money.'

Since the incendiary letter was published this morning, a number of alternative versions have gone public as well, showing a more cheeky side than anything else.

One site published a revised version of Mr Smith's letter, though this time it was written by Darth Vader who decided to leave the Empire.

In mimicking Mr Smith's points and questions about the evolution of Goldman Sachs, a firm he claimed to have loved so much, the fictional Mr Vader did the same about his once-feared Empire.

'For more than a decade I recruited and mentored candidates, some of whom were my secret children, through our gruelling interview process,' the letter reads.

'How did we get here? The Empire changed the way it thought about leadership. Leadership used to be about ideas, setting an example and killing your former mentor with a light sabre. Today, if you make enough money you will be promoted into a position of influence, even if you have a disturbing lack of faith.'

Predictably, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who Mr Smith specifically named as a root cause for the firm's supposed decline, put out a statement both to the press and to employees where he tried to discredit Mr Smith's claims and calm nervous clients.

'Needless to say, we were disappointed to read the assertions made by this individual that do not reflect our values, our culture and how the vast majority of people at Goldman Sachs think about the firm and the work it does on behalf of our clients,' Mr Blankfein wrote.

Comedian Andy Borowitz wrote his own version of Mr Blankfein's letter, clearly siding with Mr Smith.

'At Goldman, we pride ourselves on our ability to scour the worldâ€™s universities and business schools for the finest sociopaths money will buy.  Once in our internship program, these youths are subjected to rigorous evaluations to root out even the slightest evidence of a soul,' Mr Borowitz wrote pretending to be Mr Blankfein.

'But, as the case of Mr. Smith shows, even the most time-tested system for detecting shreds of humanity can blow a gasket now and then.  For that, we can only offer you our deepest apology and the reassurance that one good apple wonâ€™t spoil the whole bunch.'

The letter, and the ensuing internet firestorm, obviously made it a bad public relations day for the bank, and their share price dropped 3.4 per cent as a result.
