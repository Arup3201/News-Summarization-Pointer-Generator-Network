It's been a stormy couple of weeks for Phil Rudd, but the AC/DC drummer has been pictured larking around on a guitar in his street, with what seems like not a care in the world 

No one would ever know that the famous drummer is set to appear in court for threatening to kill a man in a few day's time as he larked around with a mate out the front of his New Zealand home.

The legend may not be set to tour with the rest of the band anytime soon - but that didn't stop him from rocking out with a mate in the first sighting of the musician since being charged with procuring a murder, threatening to kill man and drug possession charges.

The charge for plotting a murder was dropped the next day but Rudd is set to appear Tauranga district court on November 27 for the remaining charges.

It's the first time Phil Rudd has been seen since being charged with the offences as chatted with neighbours

The 60-year-old was standing out the front of his beachside home in Tauranga in New Zealand with another man wearing an AC/DC hooded jumper as he played tunes on a guitar for up to an hour on Sunday.

Due to reappear in court in just four day's time, Rudd seemed relaxed and at ease while he smiled and talked to residents walking passed as two of his luxury cars are seen parked on the front grass of his residence.  

Later Rudd left his house with a security guard and came back with a remote control helicopter carried in by the security guard.

On November 6, the rock legend appeared in court on charges of attempting to procure a man to murder two other men between September 25 and 26 and with threatening to kill another man on September 26.

He was also charged with possession of amphetamines and cannabis following a police raid on his North Island home earlier that day.

But Tauranga Crown Solicitor Greg Hollister-Jones said after reviewing the file the next day that he had 'made the decision that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the charge of attempting to procure murder.'

However, he still faces the threat to kill charge. 

The drummer, who released a solo album, Head Job,  in August, was released free on bail.
