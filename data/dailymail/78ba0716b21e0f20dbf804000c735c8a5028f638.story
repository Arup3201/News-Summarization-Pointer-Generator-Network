After her latest round of chemotherapy, the daughter of Cincinnati Bengals running back Devon Still is back home.

The NFL player tweeted to his  73,000 Twitter followers and his Instagram account on Thursday that his four-year-old daughter, Leah, is back home after having a week of chemotherapy at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

The 25-year-old tweeted: 'It was a rough couple of days with this treatment but she fought like a champ and now she's finally back home!!! #LeahStrong.'

Back Home: Devon Still, 25, uploaded this photo to Twitter and Instagram saying that his four-year-old daughter Leah is back home after her latest  round of chemotherapy treatment 

Leah was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma -- a pediatric cancer --  in June 2014. 

Since then, Leah has undergone a series of  treatments including surgery to remove a tumor, rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, and stem cell replacement therapy. 

The day Leah went in for treatment (February 20) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Still uploaded a photo toInstagram of the four-year-old wearing a shirt that said 'future cancer survivor.'

One day earlier, the father tweeted a photo of the two saying they were on a 'movie date' to see 'The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.'

Just two days after she reportedly went in for treatment, Still uploaded a photo to Instagram and Twitter saying that the young girl had a 'rough night' the night before and ended up being moved to the intensive care unit.

Still was disappointed when he learned that Leah's treatment in late December did not remove her cancer, but he wrote in an Instagram post that he would 'keep faith and keep fighting.'

If all went well with Leah's most recent treatment, the four-year-old will begin stem cell therapy, according to WCPO.

The father-daughter duo has raised more than $1 million in the last year for pediatric cancer research. 

Still was recently honored in Washington, D.C. by Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown for his humanitarian work, WCPO reports.
