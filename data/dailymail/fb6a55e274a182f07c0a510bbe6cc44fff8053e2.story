Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson and his legal team are reportedly close to reaching a plea deal in his child abuse case in Texas.

The case could be resolved as early as Tuesday, when Peterson is due back in court for a hearing to revoke his bond after he allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana before his initial hearing in September.

The disgraced football star, 29, faces one felony count of reckless injury to a child after he was accused of striking his 4-year-old son with a tree branch or switch at his gated mansion in The Woodlands.

Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson and his legal team could be set to reach a plea deal in his child abuse case in Texas on Tuesday

The possible terms of the plea deal would include reducing the felony charge down to a misdemeanor, reports KHOU.

Instead of jail time, both sides would agree to probation with a set of requirements which may include attending parenting and anger management classes and submitting to random drug tests.

It isn't known what effect the deal will have on Peterson's playing status. The Vikings star has been on paid leave since his arrest.

Officially, he is on the commissioner's exempt list and is barred from all team activities.

As a condition of his bond, Peterson has been forced to undergo drug testing after he reportedly informed an employee at the facility during a recent visit that he might not be clean.

According to court documents, Peterson allegedly told a drug-testing administrator that he had recently 'smoke a little weed' before submitting to a urinalysis test.

'During this process the defendant admitted ... that he smoked a little weed,' according to the motion filed by Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon. 

The Vikings said in a statement they were aware of the allegation and 'will await the results of that hearing before having further comment.'

Peterson was arrested and posted $15,000 bond on September 12 on a charge of injury to a child. He was later suspended indefinitely with pay by the Vikings until the matter is resolved.

He has admitted using a switch, the thin end of a tree branch, to discipline his son, but said he was not trying to injure him.

Peterson could be sentenced to up to two years in prison and fined $10,000 if convicted.

The charge against Peterson came as the NFL faced public criticism for its handling of a spate of domestic violence cases among its players. 

A number of corporate sponsors rebuked America's most popular professional sports league, which has overhauled how it deals with player behavior and punishment.
