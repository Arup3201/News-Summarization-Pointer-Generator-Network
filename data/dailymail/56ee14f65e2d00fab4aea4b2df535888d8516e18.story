Just when you thought you were ahead of the curve with your smartwatch, a new trend could mean you soon have to ditch your wrist wear for something far more stylish.

California-based Mota have become the latest company to unveil high-tech jewellery that can notify you whenever you're tagged on Facebook or have a reply to your tweet.

The group claims its 'SmartRing' will help you filter messages from work, friends and family without having to lift a finger.

Once paired with an Android or iPhone, SmartRing users can receive notifications of incoming calls, text messages, calendar notifications and email.

The ring, set to be unveiled at IFA this week in Berlin, displays the notifications in text form allowing users to scroll through the words.

'Notification of incoming calls, texts and app information has become the single most important function of a mobile phone,' said Mota Co-Founder Kevin Faro.

'But it's also become a major thorn in the side of the mobile user. The types and sources of notifications are proliferating rapidly.

Currently, SmartRing works with Facebook and Twitter, and, if enough people support the SmartRing, the company said other apps such as Instagram, Uber, and LinkedIn could be added in the future

'Increasingly many are being presented as urgent. Users tell us they continually have to delve into different apps on their phones and are becoming swamped trying to keep up.'

The SmartRing aims to deal with this problem by displays notifications on one side of the ring, with optional audio or vibration notifications to go with it.

It also has settings options which allow users control over which types of updates come through.

The Mota Smart Ring is water resistant, has a display that can be seen in bright sunlight and will be available both in black and white. Price details have yet to be unveiled.

 It's not just Mota who is developing smart jewellery. A gadget, dubbed Ringly, has a hidden feature - it can tell you when someone is calling.

It  communicates with the phone via Bluetooth, talking to either an iOS or Android app.Whenever a text, call, calendar alert, or email comes in, Ringly vibrates (like a phone would).

It can also react to push notifications from Instagram, Facebook, Vine and Snapchat. A special app allows users to customise their ring, changing everything from the number of vibrations to the colour for each caller.

'I continued to miss calls and texts from my friends and family because my phone was in my purse, and I hated leaving it on the table during social outings,' Ringly founder Christina Mercando told Fastco.

'I just kept looking at my rings and thinking, ‘I've got to be able to put technology in here that will let me solve the problem.'
