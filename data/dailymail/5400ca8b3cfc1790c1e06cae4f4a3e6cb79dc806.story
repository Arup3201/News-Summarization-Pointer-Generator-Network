Brendan Rodgers claimed Liverpool are ready for another title challenge after a 3-0 victory at Tottenham on Sunday.

Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Alberto Moreno’s stunning goal was the perfect response at White Hart Lane following their 3-1 setback at Manchester City on Monday.

Liverpool were beaten to the Barclays Premier League title by two points last season, but Rodgers is convinced they will compete at the top again.

Back to their best: Brendan Rodgers hailed an outstanding performance from Liverpool at White Hart Lane

Approval: Rodgers is happy with what he can see on the pitch as he applauds during their 3-0 win

He said: ‘We have risen to every challenge since we've been here. It was the same last year: will we score enough goals? But this group is really hungry. 

‘We lost the game on Monday and it petered away from us in the last 15 minutes, and then come to a team that's started well, but we showed we are a very good side. 

‘We played very well and clicked back into where we were last season. That's great to see, and hopefully people enjoyed watching us.

‘We were excellent. This was an outstanding performance. It’s a brilliant win.’ 

Sterling scored the opening goal for Liverpool from close range after an outstanding pass from Daniel Sturridge down the right before Jordan Henderson's cross found him on the far post.

The England forward, who joined up with Roy Hodgson’s squad after the match for the friendly with Norway on Wednesday and next Monday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland, was outstanding against Spurs.

Rodgers added: ‘His run was like Ricky Villa, but his finish was more Ricky Gervais.' 

‘He needs to be better on his left foot. He has wonderful skill, he comes inside, but he was caught in two minds for the second chance.

Cool finish: Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling scored after just eight minutes at White Hart Lane

Room to improve: Sterling was outstanding, says Rodgers, but has areas where he can get better

‘I think he was going to toe-poke it first time, and then tried to work it on to his left side. But he was fantastic.’ 

Gerrard beat Jan Molby’s record of 42 goals from the penalty spot after increasing Liverpool’s lead just after the break.

The former England captain said: ‘The challenge for this team for this season is to defend better and I am sure the manager will be buzzing with the clean sheet.’ 

Moreno got his first goal for Liverpool after a traumatic debut during the 3-1 defeat at the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening.

He dispossessed Spurs substitute Andros Townsend before racing down the left to beat Hugo Lloris.

Rodgers added: ‘He presses Townsend, nicks the ball and then he's away. The speed he showed was phenomenal and it’s a great finish. 

‘That's what I ask of the full-backs: defend first, and then attack. He was excellent.’ 

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed Liverpool were lucky to be awarded the penalty after Joe Allen’s shirt was held back by Eric Dier.

Pochettino said: ‘I’m very disappointed with the result. We had key moments in the game. We conceded the first goal, but we competed well in that first half. We had the one on one, too. Then a very soft penalty, at a key moment in the game. And at 2-0 down we tried, but we were unlucky. I'm disappointed.’ 

The Spurs chief insisted Roberto Soldado, missing through injury, will not be leaving on Monday ahead of the transfer deadline.
