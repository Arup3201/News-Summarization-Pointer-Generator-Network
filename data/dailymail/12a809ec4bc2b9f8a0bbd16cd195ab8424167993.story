A multimillionaire food tycoon's son who left a toddler brain damaged and paralysed following a horror car crash has been jailed for a second time after assaulting a man.

Antonio Boporan Singh, 28, was sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder after two men were punched, kicked and one was hit with a champagne glass at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar.

Singh, heir to a £130million chicken fortune, has already served 21 months in jail for causing horrific injuries to one-year-old Cerys Edwards in a crash while speeding at 72mph on the wrong side of a 30mph road in November 2006.

His latest jail sentence comes after a brawl at the upmarket Birmingham bar last April.

During the fight, one victim, Jarondeep Kooner, was slashed across the face with a champagne flute by Theodore Mullings-Fairweather, who then repeatedly kicked and stamped on the man as he lay injured on the floor.

Singh from Little Aston, West Midlands - who earlier paid £400 to secure a VIP table at the bar - left the club with Mullings-Fairweather and alongside Edward Ansah and Nathan Pringle.

But as they walked into a nearby street the group saw a 31-year-old man with his shirt ripped.

Assuming him to be part of the group involved in the fight, Mullings-Fairweather and Singh punched and kicked him to the ground before running off.

The minute-long attack was captured on CCTV and left both victims, Harprit Singh and Mr Kooner, requiring hospital treatment.

Mr Kooner, 22, suffered a fractured eye socket and has since lost use of an eye.

Singh had pleaded guilty to one count of inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder at Birmingham Crown Court in February, and was given one year in jail on Friday.

Mullings-Fairweather, 25, from Selly Oak, Birmingham admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was jailed for eight years.

He also received another eight years for a separate offence of robbery after stealing a cash box from outside a Tesco store.

Singh's father Ranjit Singh Boparan owns 2 Sisters Food Group - a Birmingham-based food-manufacturing company.

Established in 1993 as a frozen retail cutting operation, it has grown rapidly and expanded to cover 36 manufacturing sites in the UK, eight in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and one in Poland.

The group employs 23,000 people, and has annual sales of £3.4billion. It is listed 14th on the 2014 Sunday Times Top Track 100.

The company is now the third largest food company in the UK by turnover.

Brands include Fox's Biscuits, Goodfella's, Donegal Catch and Green Isle.

Harry Ramsden's was sold to Boparan Ventures Ltd in 2010, the private investment branch of his business empire.

Pringle, 32, from Erdington, Birmingham, and Ansah, 24, from Sutton Coldfield, both admitted violent disorder and were given 18 months imprisonment.

Addressing Singh, Judge Simon Drew QC said: 'The assault occasioning actual bodily harm took place after the violent assault and should be considered entirely separate and was a gratuitous attack.

'It involved you kicking a man on the ground to the head. These courts regard that conduct as very serious.'

Michael Wolkind, defending, said Singh had not been drinking that night and said he led a 'cautious' lifestyle.

He added the 28-year-old had dedicated his life to the Boparan Charitable Trust, which helps sick children.

After the hearing, Detective Constable Allan Jones, who led the inquiry, said: 'This was a violent attack which devastated the lives of two young men.

'Both needed extensive medical treatment and the 22-year-old has suffered permanent sight loss as a result of this group's actions.

Singh had previously been jailed for 21 months for hitting the car Cerys Edwards was in while overtaking at 70mph in a 30mph area in November 2006.

The youngster, now nine-years-old, was left unable to talk and walk and still requires a ventilator just to keep her alive.

Speaking after the sentencing, the father of Cerys's father, Gareth, 50, from Sutton Coldfield said: 'I think his sentence is very lenient considering his previous conviction.

The impact of the crash was so severe that Cerys, pictured before the incident, was ripped from her baby seat and her spine was fractured

'He won't learn anything from this and he will just do it again and again. I think it would take someone actually dying for him to stop and think.

'It's just absolutely ridiculous what he has done. He is the son of a millionaire, he couldn't want for anything.

I just can't get my head round that mentality. He's out of control.'

Singh, was just 19 when he caused Cerys' life threatening injuries while speeding in his powerful Range Rover Sport.

The impact of the crash in Sutton Coldfield was so severe the 11-month-old was ripped from her baby seat and her spine fractured.

The car was bought by his wealthy parents, Ranjit and Baljinder Boparan, who run the 2 Sisters Food Group, the third largest food company in the UK by turnover with an annual revenue of £3.4billion.

The outrage over Singh's sentence at the time sparked a campaign demanding government action.

Singh crashed the Range Rover his parents bought him when he was overtaking the Edwards family car at 70mph in a 30mph area 

More than 13,000 campaigners supported tougher sentences and a petition was also delivered to Westminster by Cerys's parents in July 2009.

Labour's former Justice Minister Jack Straw called the Edwards family himself to give them the news about what became known as 'Cerys's Law'.

As a result of the changes anyone convicted of causing serious injury by dangerous driving now faces up to five years in prison instead of the previous maximum of two.

Cerys was awarded £5 million compensation in 2012 along with a guaranteed annual payout of £450,000 for the rest of her life.

At the time Judge Martin McKenna, sitting at Birmingham County Court, described it as the 'saddest and most tragic case' he had ever come across.
