May have HIV: Richard Thomas will not find out until later this week if he is infected with the virus as a direct result of a sex attack he carried out on a woman

A man who has been jailed for raping a woman has been told that he could have contracted HIV as a result of the attack he inflicted upon his victim.

Richard Thomas, 27, collapsed when police informed him about the woman's medical status and is still waiting to hear if he has contracted the incurable virus.

Thomas, of Leigh in Greater Manchester, knew the woman and was aware that she has another illness but had not known about the HIV.

The court heard he was shocked when he was told and asked to be taken to hospital, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

He had let himself into her home in the middle of the night and she awoke to find him raping her.

'She froze and no words were exchanged. He pulled up his shorts and left,' said Harry Pepper, prosecuting.

'He
was arrested and interviewed and said he had been drinking heavily, 
taken cocaine and ecstasy and could not recall the incident,' he added.

His
barrister, Virginia Hayton, said that he still cannot recall the attack
but when told about it he said that the woman 'would not lie, she tells
the truth. If she says I have done it, I have done it'.

Jailing
Thomas for five years and four months Judge Mark Brown said that he had
committed 'this dreadful offence' while she lay asleep, having taken a 
sleeping tablet, and it had left her distressed and anxious.

He also ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life. Thomas pleaded guilty to raping the woman on July 20 this year.

Miss Hayton said that Thomas, who has previous convictions but none for sexual offences, is 'remorseful' and 'cannot understand why he did it and it is troubling him'.

Torment: A rapist recently jailed at Liverpool Crown Court will have to wait until Friday to find out if he has caught HIV from his victim

She said that he started using cannabis at the age of nine, drinking heavily at the age of 11, became addicted to ecstasy and cocaine at 13 and was put in care the following year.

He has been trying to contact his family but they want nothing to do with him and he will now be away from his partner and their young daughter and his two other older daughters from previous relationships.

Miss Hayton told the court that Thomas will not find out the result of his HIV test until Friday and has had the worry of the outcome hanging over him.

'It is his own fault, if he had not committed this offence he would not have placed himself in this position.'
