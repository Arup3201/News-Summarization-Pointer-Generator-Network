With a manic glare and chilling cackle, Chucky terrified 1980s cinema-goers as he committed a series of horrific murders.

But according to Emma Kivell, the four-foot-tall killer doll is 'just so cute'.

Miss Kivell, 31, fell in love with the voodoo-obsessed character from the slasher franchise Child's Play when she saw the first film in 1988.

Now, she has transformed her room into a shrine to the terrifying figure.

Her pillow is a giant Chucky face, and her bed is lined with soft toy versions of Chucky.

She also owns a nodding doll, a beanie doll, and the full DVD box set - which she has confessed to watching 'about 1,000 times'.

On Halloween, Miss Kivell, an air hostess, has dressed up as her flame-haired idol.

For her birthday, she had a custom-made cake fashioned to look like the character's face.

Child's Play is a series of six slasher movies that follows a murderous four-foot-tall doll, Chucky.

Once a killer called Charles Lee Ray, he is murdered in a toy shop and his soul is transferred into the body of a doll. A murderous rampage ensues.

It is based on Robert The Doll, a toy belonging to US artist Robert Eugene Otto in the 1940s-70s, which was supposedly possessed.

Chucky is voiced by character actor Brad Dourif, famed for his role as Billy Bibbit in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and later as Grima Wormtongue in Lord Of The Rings.

Miss Kivell, from Stockport, said: 'I just love him, he is so funny and cute, watching the films you just wouldn’t expect a voice to come out of a doll.'

'I sleep with my soft doll and my chucky pillow of a night, which has freaked out boyfriends in the past.

'One actually wanted it out of the bed before he would sleep in it.'

Child’s Play is about a voodoo-obsessed 
serial killer called Charles Lee Ray, known as the Lakeshore Strangler, 
who is killed by a police officer in a toy shop.

But as he takes his dying breath, he swears revenge and transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll and begins his murderous rampage.

The first installment was released in 1988 and the six film, Curse of Chucky, was released in 2013.

But rather than the original, Miss Kivell's favourite film in the series is the 1998 edition Bride of Chucky, which saw the franchise take a more tongue-in-cheek tone.

She said: 'Chucky becomes a funnier character and some of the one liners in the film are great.

'I like the films because there so much detail that goes into them and they’re classics.

'Cute': She insists the four-foot-tall killer is 'cute' and 'funny' in the series that shocked 1980s moviegoers

Collecting: Miss Kivell says boyfriends have asked her to get rid of the dolls but she is expanding her collection

Smitten: Miss Kivell says The Bride Of Chucky is the best film as it brings out a funny side to the murderous figure

'Films today are all computerized and it gets boring - with Chucky even though it is the same kind of storyline there’s always a twist.'

Despite driving friends and boyfriends crazy with her Chucky obsession, Miss Kivell insists she will continue to add to her bizarre collection.

She said: 'I find it funny how much it winds up my friends, they think I’m mad but I love it.

'I’m going to get some Chucky wall art soon to finish off my bedroom.'
