A freak accident involving a broken wine glass was reportedly what killed R&B singer Charmayne Maxwell over the weekend.

The 46-year-old member of the Grammy-nominated group Brownstone was found bleeding to death by her husband Carsten Soulshock on Friday night at their home in Los Angeles, California.

According to TMZ, evidence suggest the music star fell backwards while holding a wine glass, as two fatal puncture wounds were discovered at the back of her neck.

Authorities told the news source,after interviewing Maxwell's family members, that they do not suspect foul play and there is no history of domestic violence.

One theory is that she could have been 'intoxicated' before falling to her death.

Autopsy and toxicology tests will help set the record straight.  

The mother-of-one was apparently discovered by a door leading out to a back patio around 9pm.

Her husband rushed her to hospital but she allegedly died on the way.
