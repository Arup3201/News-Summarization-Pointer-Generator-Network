Bizarre: Nathan Meunch arrives at Shrewsbury Crown Court with a paper bag over his head despite being pictured at an earlier hearing

Two fraudsters who tried to pass off ice cubes as iPads but were rumbled when they melted have been spared jail.

Nathan Meunch, 29, and Nigel Bennett, 39, walked into a post office with a parcel claiming they were posting iPads.

But in fact they had stuffed the package with ice cubes before sending it via Special Delivery on May 14 last year.

They hoped to log an insurance claim with Royal Mail claiming £2,500 of iPads had been mislaid.

But the pair were unaware the soggy parcel had burst behind the counter at the post office in Whitchurch, Shropshire.

Staff became suspicious when they noticed wet patches on Meunch's jacket and alerted Royal Mail investigators.

Meunch, of Leegomery, Telford, was found guilty of fraud following a trial.

He turned up at court on Friday wearing a bizarre paper bag disguise just weeks after posing for pictures at an earlier hearing.

Meanwhile Bennett, of Stirchley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to the same charge.

Both men received a 12-month community order and 150 hours of unpaid work.

They were also ordered to pay £500 towards prosecution costs within six months.

Recorder Mr Christopher Hotten QC told them: 'You, Mr Bennett, accept responsibility for the idea of this offence.

'You were short of money and you wanted to make some money.

'You prepared a package containing ice cubes which was represented to contain iPad screens.

'You, Mr Meunch, took it to the post office and dispatched it and it was you who submitted a compensation claim.

'The plan was unsuccessful. The ice melted and the post office were quite well aware within an hour that this was a scam.'

During the trial the court heard the parcel had 'disintegrated' in front of shocked postal workers.

Counter clerk Elaine Sloane, told the court how she served Meunch, on May 14, 2012 and noticed damp spots on his jacket.

She said: 'I just happened to say to the gentleman is it raining outside and he said yes but it seemed strange to me because I could see from where I was sitting it didn't look like it was raining.'

'I asked him what was inside and he said iPads.

'About an hour later, a colleague noticed a puddle of water beneath the Special Delivery pile.

'We had a little look and you could see all ice in there.

'He had sent it as iPads and I couldn't believe it was all this water and the box was disintegrating.'

Denis Desmond, defending Bennett, said: 'The reason he did this was he was running a music hall and could not raise the money to rent the venue.

'He hatched this not just unsuccessful but rather pathetic plan.'

The court heard in 2008 Bennett, an engineer, was jailed for three years for possession with intent to supply ecstasy.
