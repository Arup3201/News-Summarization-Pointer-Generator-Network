It's the day their fans have all been waiting for in the hope Taylor Swift and Harry Styles will reunite once more.

And it seems the singers' devotees have got their wish in some way at least.

On the same day the country starlet and One Direction hunk look set to cross paths at the NRJ Music Awards in France, their lookalikes have fashioned a reunion of their own.

Are Taylor Swift and Harry Styles back together? No it's just their lookalikes posing up together in London

Teenager Jacob Skelton, who beholds Harry's trademark windswept hair and cheeky grin, has become an overnight internet sensation thanks to his uncanny resemblance to the X Factor star.

And to trick fans even more he happily posed up with another lookalike of Styles' ex girlfriend Taylor in London on Saturday morning.

The pair attempted to get into BBC Radio 1 as a publicity stunt as they showed off just how much they look like their famous doppelgangers.

The real duo (before the split): Harry and Taylor are both currently in 
France and could actually reunite on the same day their lookalikes 
fashioned a get together in London

Will the real thing happen? Teenager Jacob Skelton has
become a sensation thanks to his uncanny looks to the One 
Direction star, who is currently in France rumoured to be reuniting with 
Taylor at the NRJ Music Awards

Jacob even wore similar clothing to Harry, stepping out in a smart suit jacket over a T-shirt.

And to confuse their fans even more he showed off a fake tattoo showing : 'I heart TS,' to mock their now failed romance.

Although the former couple haven't yet really reunited, it could be that they will do on Saturday night.

The American serial dater and the One 
Direction heartthrob are rumoured to be showing the world that 'Haylor' 
is back on with a very public reunion at the French awards show.

The real deal: Taylor Swift and Harry Styles are rumoured to be reuniting at the French awards show on Saturday night and have both been pictured in the area this weekend

Styles and his One Direction bandmates have already been spotted arriving and tweeting about the festivities, while Taylor flew in a few days ago.

The second wind comes after the lovelorn pair reportedly met for crisis talks in London and decided their relationship was worth saving.

A source told The Sun newspaper: 'Taylor realised she was being a bit full-on.

'She is now more relaxed about their 
relationship. She intends to enjoy it more rather than worry about where
it could eventually lead.

'Harry is not the sort of guy you can stay mad at for long. She’s 
given him some space and it’s done them both a world of good. What 
happened over New Year is now a distant memory.'

Harry, 18, is said to be planning a number of romantic gestures for 
the We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together hitmaker in Cannes, where 
they will stay in the same hotel.

Lookalike Jacob Skelton, 15, meanwhile, has become an internet sensation and famous in his own right after a friend posted a photo of him online pointing out his resemblance to the One Direction member.

started commenting that he looked like the One Direction singer

The real deal: But while the pair have the same windswept hair and cheeky smile, Harry Styles, pictured, has green eyes while Jacob has brown eyes

He now has more than 11,000 followers on Twitter, is frequently stopped in the street by fans and has been invited as a guest on to TV talk shows.

Appearing on Daybreak this morning, the teenager said: 'People always ask for pictures with me on the street and on Twitter I've got a lot of marriage proposals.'

He revealed how he never even knew who Harry Styles was and had never watched X Factor - the show which saw the singer's band One Direction catapulted to fame - before a friend's mother claimed he looked like 18-year-old Styles.

He said: 'I went to knock for my friend before school and One Direction were on TV and my friends mum looked at One Direction and then she looked at me and said I looked like him.

Guess who: Harry Styles lookalike Jacob Skelton,
pictured left at the ITV studios, has become an internet sensation 
because he so closely resembles the 18-year-old One Direction singer,

The centre of attention: The teenager didn't answer when asked if the attention had gone to his head, but just screwed up his nose

'I don't think I looked that much like him but she said I did and from there people have just said I do.'

The teen revealed that his went from being a complete unknown to having 10,000 followers on Twitter in less than two months after a friend posted a picture of him on the website.

He told The Sun: 'I’ve been getting hundreds of new 
followers every day, saying things like, "You look so much like Harry 
Styles, please marry me?".'

And privacy is becoming a thing of the past for Jacob - just as it already is for his famous doppelganger.

He told the newspaper: 'When I go out I get stared at all the time. And when I’m down the park I get girls in their 20s coming up to me.

No more privacy: Jacob says he is stared at when he goes out and has even been followed around a zoo

On the sofa: Daybreak presenters Aled Jones and Kate Garraway interview Jacob Skelton, pictured with his father Karl, about what it is like to look like a singing megastar

'I even got followed around Whipsnade Zoo by some girls who asked for a photo with me.'

Asked on Daybreak whether he had 
altered his hair to look more like the singer, Jacob replied: 'No, my 
hair's been like this since I was about 10.'

The
teen from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire then admitted the attention 
may have gone to his head slightly by screwing up his nose at a question
asked by presenter Aled Jones.

His
father Karl added that while he hoped his son would be able to use his 
new found fame to his advantage, school still comes first.

Hopes for the future: Karl Skelton said he hopes his son can make a career out of looking like the singer but added he needs to finish school first

Doppelganger: Daybreak Tweeted this picture of Jacob and told Harry Styles fans the lookalike would be appearing on the show

He said: 'I think he can have a career but we've got to take it easy, he still has school.

'We will be looking into either doing a lookalike agency or maybe he could do modelling for clothes in the magazines.'

And just like his son, property developer Karl had no idea who Harry Styles was before he made Jacob famous.

He said: 'It's amazing really. I saw a picture of Harry Styles on a magazine on someone's coffee table and I had to do a double take.

'Everyone said he looked like Harry Styles and I wasn't really bothered, I didn't know who he was, until I saw that.'
