Investing in the stock market could soon be a whole lot easier with the help of a new smartphone application.

Application Acorns takes the price tags of credit and debit card expenses and automatically rounds them to the next highest dollar. Whatever is left  is placed in a portfolio users can access right on their phones, according to Acorns' website.

At least $5 is needed for one of Acorns' investment options, the website says.  In a 'conservative' portfolio,  40 percent is dedicated to government bonds.  30 percent goes toward real estate stocks and 25 percent goes toward small company stocks in 'aggressive' portfolios.

Acorns also lets app users make both lump payments or set up automatic payments.

Only $10,000 can be deposited per day, and Acorns also allows for full withdrawals. The app does, however, have its users pay small fees.

'After you begin investing, we charge $1 per month and .25 – .50% of your investment annually,' Acorns says on its website. 

Acorns also maintains that the app could help users put away significant change.

'Over time, incremental investing has the potential to transform seemingly trivial amounts of money into a sizeable investment account,' Acorns says on its website. 'By investing just $1 per day with a 10% return, your account could grow to more than $2,000 after five years. By increasing this to $5 per day, you could reach $10,000 after five years, or $30,000 after ten years.' 

Jeff Cruttenden, who founded Acorns with his father Walter Cruttenden, told Wired 'We had to consider people who are Ubering home and walking down the street. They don’t have a check with them or 15 minutes to pore over a complicated document. We wanted to simplify and streamline it.'

Meanwhile, Walter Cruttenden told the website 'There are 315,000 financial advisers out there. We’re not trying to compete with them.'
