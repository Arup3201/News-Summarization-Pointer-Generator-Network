British No 2 James Ward is guaranteed a spot in the main draw of the Australian Open after US Open champion Marin Cilic pulled out with a right shoulder injury on Saturday.

Ward has had a long and tense wait to find out if he needed to go through qualifying after originally being named as the sixth alternate when the main entry list was released last month.

But a number of withdrawals - including that of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Tommy Haas and now Cilic - means that Ward is now within the main draw ranking cut and will not need to qualify for the first Grand Slam of the year, which begins on January 19.

US Open champion Marin Cilic has announced he will miss the Australian Open with a shoulder injury

He said in a statement on his official website: 'I am really disappointed to announce that I had to withdraw from the Australian Open. Right shoulder injury, that hampers me for some time now and forced me to withdraw from the ATP event in Brisbane, is improving day by day, but I still don't feel fit enough to be able to compete at the highest level.

'I am really sad that I won't be able to participate in Melbourne, especially after winning the last grand slam in New York, but I was advised by doctors to be careful as much as possible to avoid even more serious problems.

'I have received lots of support letters from my fans worldwide lately and I am grateful for your support and best wishes. I was really looking forward to be back on court in Australia and now I hope we will meet very soon in Zagreb.'

Ward is the first British male singles player other than Andy Murray to earn direct entry into a Grand Slam since Tim Henman at the 2007 US Open. 

James Ward has gained a place in the main draw as a consequence of Cilic's absence 

The 27-year-old is on the cusp of entering the top 100 for the first time, currently sitting at a ranking of No 101 with few points to defend until March.

British men who will have to go through qualifying at Melbourne Park next week are Kyle Edmund, Liam Broady and Brydan Klein.

Heather Watson is the only British female in the main women's singles draw, while Johanna Konta and Naomi Broady bid to qualify.

Laura Robson will be absent in Melbourne as she continues her rehabilitation from wrist surgery, with the 20-year-old expected to return on the second-tier ITF circuit next month.
