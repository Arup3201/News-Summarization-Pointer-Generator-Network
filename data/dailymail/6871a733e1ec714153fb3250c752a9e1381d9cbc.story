William Hague hailed a deal struck with Iran over its nuclear programme as good for the world after hours of ‘painstaking’ negotiations.

The Foreign Secretary said the agreement, which would force Iran to downgrade its almost weapons-grade uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, was a victory for diplomacy.

But critics including Israel and Saudi Arabia warned it was a ‘disaster’ for world peace, lifting £4.3 billion worth of sanctions on Iran with little evidence that Tehran was serious about abandoning its nuclear programme.

Deal: William Hague, who met US Secretary of State John Kerry last night, hailed the deal over Iran's nuclear programme

The deal was struck in Geneva between Iran, the United States, France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia after winning the critical endorsement of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Under the arrangement, Iran will benefit from the unfreezing of its foreign currency reserves and gain sanctions relief in trade in gold, precious metals, petrochemicals, auto and aircraft parts.

There are hopes that the break-through will thaw decades of poor relations between Iran and America which started with the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

It is however just the first step in a six month programme aimed at getting Iran to stop enriching its uranium.

There also seemed to be confusion between the world powers and Iran as to whether the deal would stop all uranium enrichment by Tehran.

Mr Hague said it would force Iran to scrap its stockpile of uranium that was enriched to 20 per cent.

He described the negotiations as ‘painstaking’ on Twitter but later insisted it was a ‘good deal’ for the Middle East and the world.

It will also force Iran to stop enriching uranium beyond the 5 per cent level – slightly above what is required to run a nuclear power plant.

Iran is also meant to stop development of new enrichment centrifuges but will not be forced to dismantle existing ones during the six-month negotiation period.

It will however have to stop work on its heavy-water reactor near the city of Arak which could lead to the development of weapons-grade plutonium.

Mr Hague met US Secretary of State John Kerry last night alongside the Libyan Prime Minister to discuss the deal and the wider Middle East.

He said the agreement should ‘give us faith in the power of diplomacy and pressure to resolve even some very intractable problems.

‘This is a change in behaviour from Iran and we should respond constructively and openly to that and that’s what we’re doing, the tone of these meetings is very different from the past, I think they are very sincere, they are very tough negotiators.’

Mr Hague said it was inevitable that countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia would harbour doubts over the credibility of the deal.

The Foreign Secretary admitted Iran has a ‘history of not revealing the truth of its nuclear programme’ but he added it was the first time Iran had entered into an international agreement about its nuclear programme.

After meeting Mr Hague, Senator Kerry said the hard work could only begin now.

This would involve taking the ‘enormous steps in terms of verification, transparency and accountability.’

Iran’s foreign minister and chief negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said it was only the ‘first step’.

‘We need to start moving in the direction of restoring confidence, a direction which we have managed to move against in the past,’ he said.

US President Barack Obama warned the tap of sanctions relief could be turned off if Iran did not keep up its end of the agreement.

‘There are substantial limitations which will help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon,” he said in a late-night appearance at the White House after the deal was sealed. ‘Simply put, they cut off Iran’s most likely paths to a bomb.’

But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the deal. ‘What was achieved last night in Geneva is not a historic agreement, it was a historic mistake,’ he said.

‘Today the world has become a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world took a significant step towards obtaining the world’s most dangerous weapon.’

And a Saudi Arabian official said his government was ‘very concerned about these negotiations with Iran’, adding: ‘There is a lot of worry right now about threats to the region.’

Douglas Alexander, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, said the deal was potentially the most important announcement between Iran and the West for decades.

‘Crucially, the apparent agreement of the Iranian government to curb enrichment and grant greater access to inspectors show the important progress that appears to have been made.

‘The strength of the agreement will be tested through its implementation, and if Iran is shown to renege on its obligations then the international community should be ready to reverse sanctions relief and maintain pressure.

He added: ‘In the days ahead it will be important for the British Government to provide further details to Parliament so that the interim deal can be closely scrutinised.’
