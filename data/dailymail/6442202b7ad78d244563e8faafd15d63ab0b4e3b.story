Glenn Hoddle has ruled himself out of the running to become Newcastle United's new head coach - insisting he is 'enjoying' the challenge of trying to keep Queens Park Rangers in the Premier League.

The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea manager has been touted as a possible replacement for Alan Pardew at St James' Park.

Newcastle are currently without a head coach following Pardew's departure to Crystal Palace last week, with John Carver due to take charge of the team when they face Chelsea on Saturday as he has done for the previous two matches.

And Hoddle's coaching attributes have ensured he has been mentioned as a contender for the Magpies hotseat.

But Hoddle, who has been out of management since he left Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2006, has revealed that he is content with his role as first-team coach under Harry Redknapp at QPR for the time being.

Speaking to Zapsportz.com, a website Hoddle co-founded, the former Southampton boss said: 'There has been a lot of speculation. The media have been chasing me for a reaction to being heavily linked to the vacant Newcastle job.

'All I am prepared to say is that I'm really enjoying the challenge of trying to keep QPR up this season.

'Although I have never shut the door on management I'm happy doing what I'm doing now with QPR.' 

Hoddle has denied that any approach has been made by Mike Ashley, Lee Charnley or anybody from the Newcastle hierarchy - and insists he is not interested in such a role at this time. 

Newcastle are believed to be considering a wide variety of potential candidates for the role, including former Lyon boss Remi Garde, Saint Etienne head coach Christophe Galtier and ex-Mainz manager Thomas Tuchel.

Derby County boss Steve McClaren has also been linked to the role, although he too has distanced himself, insisting he is happy at the iPro Stadium.

But 57-year-old Hoddle added: 'Harry gave me the chance to tip my toe back into coaching water and I'm up for the challenge. I've enjoyed working with Harry and the team - and I've enjoyed working with Harry and the staff.

'I'm looking forward to the second half of the season and the challenges that will bring in our attempt to stay up.'
