The cost of a hotel room in Glasgow has rocketed as the city plays host to the Commonwealth Games next week.

A new report which was published shows rooms have increased by a massive 158 per cent.

This means that a night in a hotel will now cost an average of £344 for the Games period of 23 July to 4 August, according to the Trivago Hotel Price Index (THPI) for July.

This is compared to an average of £133 for the week previous, and is a significant increase on this time last year, when a hotel room in Glasgow cost an average of just £78.

The most expensive night - Sunday 27 July will cost an average of £448, the study found, with Trivago suggesting this spike was due to the planned opening of the newly refurbished Hampden Park stadium on this date.

The stadium, which has received a £14m overhaul, will host athletics events including the men's 5,000 metres, in which Mo Farah is rumoured to be competing.

May saw the largest increase in interest in the city's hotels - a rise of 104 per cent and in June, searches increased by a further 13per cent.
