Former West Ham and Watford boss Gianfranco Zola is in the frame to take charge at his former club Cagliari, according to reports in Italy.

La Gazzetta dello Sport have suggested that the 48-year-old is favourite for the job with the Serie A strugglers and could be appointed during the two-week winter break.

Zeman was sacked as Cagliari manager on Tuesday morning. A statement on the club's website read: 'Cagliari Calcio announces that from now Zdenek Zeman leaves the technical guidance of the first team.

'The company would like to thank the coach and all his staff for the work done in recent months with great professionalism and dedication.'

Zola, who played for Cagliari between 2003 and 2005, has not had a job since resigning from Watford in December 2013 following a poor run of form.

Zeman was appointed in July and guided Cagliari to a 4-1 victory over Inter Milan in September, but the Rossoblu have won only one match in 12 subsequent fixtures.

Zola spent two seasons at West Ham United but was sacked in May 2010 after just avoiding relegation

A 3-1 defeat to Juventus last Thursday dropped Cagliari to 18th place in the league, three points adrift of safety, and the 67-year-old Zeman has paid the price for the wretched run of form.

Zeman has also coached the likes of Lazio, Roma, Fenerbahce and Red Star Belgrade during his 31-year managerial career.

La Gazzetta dello Sport have also mentioned Walter Zenga and Delio Rossi as candidates for the job.
