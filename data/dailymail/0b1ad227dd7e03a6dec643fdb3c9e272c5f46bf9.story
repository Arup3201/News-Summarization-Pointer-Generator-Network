Known as the generation of entitlement, Gen Ys have now proved critics wrong by claiming the title of Australia's smartest savers.

CommBank has found Gen Ys, aged 18 to 30, have a savings IQ 4.2 points greater than the national average. 

In fact, those from Gen Y who participated in  a financial education program scored the highest score of 130.9, while people aged 50 to 59 who did not learn to manage their money scored the lowest, 117.4.

Known as the generation of entitlement, Gen Ys have proved critics wrong by claiming the title of Australia's Smartest Savers from their parents and grandparents. 

Commbank spokesman Danielle Murrie said these findings will surprise many people because of the reputation of the younger generation. 

She said people tend to think Gen Y as having a 'less mature approach to personal savings'.

'Our research indicates Gen Ys have above average commitment and control when it comes to their finances. While many factors contribute to savings success, the findings suggest the key difference between Gen Y and older generations is more recent exposure to good money management programs taught at school.

'This, combined with better savings discipline and fewer external barriers to saving, such as kids or a mortgage, have proven Gen Y to be the ultimate savvy savers,' she says.

Gen Y are not the only Australians who are great at saving, the study reveals Australians on a whole are great at money management with 86 per cent reporting to be so

The findings came from people's responses to questions that focused on four key aspects - commitment, discipline, control and savviness.

However, no matter the age, research found if you had received education on money management your saving IQ would be greater. 

The questionnaire revealed 89 per cent said education has a positive affect on children's financial future. These programs also influenced people under 30 to be regular savers, revealing they typically place a large sum of their pay cheque in a savings account. 

'It’s encouraging to see strong links between financial education programs and future financial success. I’m especially proud to see that our youngest adult generation, those that had the highest participation rates for early financial education, have the highest Savings IQ of all the generations,'  Ms Murrie said.

But Gen Y are not the only Australians who are great at saving, the study reveals Australians on a whole are great at money management with 86 per cent reporting to be so.

CommBank found 88 per cent that were good at saving made shopping lists and researched prices before purchasing.

Despite these positive results among the Australian population, CommBank believes there is still room for improvement for those who are stressed out with their money management.
