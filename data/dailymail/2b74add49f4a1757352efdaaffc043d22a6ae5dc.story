Alan Hansen has left the door open for a return to TV just days after leaving the BBC and Match of the Day.

Hansen was a regular pundit on the MotD sofa for over 20 years and Sunday’s World Cup final was his final job for the Beeb.

But the former Scotland defender, who won eight league titles in 14 years at Liverpool, says he would be tempted to return to punditry to work on Champions League games featuring his former club.

Hansen said in his column for the Daily Telegraph: ‘The viewing public have not got rid of me forever because I will dip in and out of television in the future, but I will not be under contract again to become a permanent pundit on another show.

'There is an appeal to covering certain Liverpool games, perhaps in the Champions League, but I am now happy to take a step back and see what the future brings for the first time since I started out at Partick Thistle more than 40 years ago.' 

Hansen says he decided to quit Match of 
the Day after two decades when he saw younger footballers, such as Rio 
Ferdinand, come on the scene and be more able to relate to the modern game.

He also cited the rise of social media as another factor in his decision to leave the BBC.

He added: ‘Rio Ferdinand, and Twitter, are two of the factors which prove to me that the time is right to move on after more than two decades. 

‘Rio and I have both played the game at 
the back at the top level for the biggest clubs and we see and say many 
of the same things, but Rio brings a freshness to it and ensures that 
what he says sounds different to what I say, even if we are saying the 
same thing.’
