A 64-year-old Pennsylvania woman who has said she sold marijuana to help raise several grandchildren after her daughter died has been sentenced to 15 to 30 months in state prison.

The Valley News Dispatch reported Candace Kelly was also ordered Thursday to cough up $75,000 for fines, and appear December 1 at a prison.

Kelly entered guilty pleas last month for drug selling charges, according to the newspaper. 

Grandmother: Candace Kelly, 64, has said the funds she made from selling drugs were used to raise her multiple grandchildren 

Drug selling: Police say Kelly bought large quantities of marijuana at $3,300 per pound and resold it at a profit of $100 per pound

It is believed by investigators that Kelly sold up to 100 pounds of marijuana a year for more than four years, The Valley News Dispatch reported.

State police seized $393,000 when they raided her Buffalo Township home last fall. Police also seized 64 pounds of hydroponically grown marijuana.

The newspaper reported that police seized 2 pounds of hallucinogenic mushrooms as well as roughly 2 pounds of hashish - plus 'drug pipes, items used to package the marijuana, a marijuana grinder, digital scale, and papers showing the extent of her drug trafficking.'

The Pennsylvania State Police, as well as the Pennsylvania State Attorney General's drug task force, are set to get the majority of Kelly's hefty funds -- which she assented to handing over at the October plea hearing, The Valley News Dispatch reported.

She has said the funds were used by her to support her grandchildren.

Police say Kelly bought large quantities of marijuana at $3,300 per pound and resold it at a profit of $100 per pound.

'Legalize it man,' Kelly told CBS Pittsburgh in January 2014. 'If I can make that kind of money, why can’t the rest of Pennsylvania wise up? 

'I never got on Welfare, I never drew anything from the system, I raised all my kids on my own. That’s my only crime.'

Peace: Kelly gave the peace sign to a local news station in January 2014 and said at the time she supported marijuana legalization
