A husband who booked a 50th wedding anniversary party at a hotel was left horrified after his wife died and the owners refused to refund his deposit.

Griefstricken Eric Clifton, 78, is almost £700 out of pocket after cancelling the event because his beloved wife Joyce, 72, died from cancer.

The couple had forked out £160 for an initial deposit and a further £535 towards the bash to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary with 45 friends.

Tragically Mrs Clifton, a retired school teacher, passed away eight weeks before the big day following chemotherapy for bone and breast cancer.

Army veteran Mr Clifton, from Swanmore in Hampshire, was shocked when staff at Lysses House, Fareham, told him the entire sum was non-returnable.

Mr Clifton said: 'After Joyce died we phoned Lysses to let them know and they said 'That’s a deposit, that’s non-returnable, we did tell you that'.'

'But the second payment surely wasn’t, but they said It was all deposit, you've lost that.

'I'm pretty cross. My wife and I had been to Lysses for several occasions for meals, family meals and for functions with an amateur dramatic society.

'I am not ever going to have any more dealings with Lysses House and I’m telling all my friends.'

Insurance: Colin Mercer, the owner Lysses House Hotel (pictured), said Joyce Clifton's death was 'Frankly not our fault'. He added that the couple should have taken out insurance to protect their deposit

Mr Clifton added he felt 'quite bitter' about his dealings with the hotel, which is in a building he used to work in for defence firm Vosper Thornycroft.

The former staff sergeant from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers met his wife during a posting to Germany while she was on holiday.

They went on to have two sons and five grandchildren.

Hotel owner Colin Mercer said the money cannot be refunded and Mr Clifton had been advised to take out insurance for the booking.

It included a 10 per cent deposit when the booking was made, 40 per cent 12 weeks before the event and the remainder six weeks before the day.

Mr Mercer said: 'We were very upset that Mrs Clifton died... It's standard practice in the whole of the hotel business.

'We’ve committed the money - we’ve allocated resources, everything else... We have a wedding booking and sometimes the couple break up. Frankly, it’s not our fault.

'The Cliftons were booking the entire downstairs facility. If we manage to re-let, which we weren’t able to, then we refund.'

Mr Mercer added he was upset Mr Clifton and his family had left negative reviews on the Trip Advisor website about the hotel.
