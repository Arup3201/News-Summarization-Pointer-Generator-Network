Eilidh Child was unable to give Hampden Park the victory it craved above all others, but still claimed Commonwealth silver in the 400 metres hurdles.

The poster girl of Glasgow 2014 was beaten to the title by Kaliese Spencer, the favourite, coming home in 55.02 seconds, with the Jamaican taking a dominant win in 54.10secs.

The 27-year-old, whose pictures are plastered on billboards across the city, was greeted by deafening cheers from a packed crowd amid a sea of Saltires inside the national stadium.

She and Spencer both went off hard, but it was the latter who had established a clear lead coming into the home straight and Child could not close the gap.

Running from lane six, with Spencer three inside her, Child knew she had to go out hard.

The tension was increased when, with the athletes in their blocks, a sudden noise inside the stadium prompted laughter and the athletes had to stand up.

Child still held her nerve and her form, but it was not enough to upstage the classy Spencer, the world number one this year.

Jessica Ennis-Hill, who experienced the pressure of being the 'face' of a Games at London 2012, was quick to congratulate Child, saying on Twitter: 'Congratulation!! Brilliant run! Lots of pressure and pulled it out the bag :) Enjoy celebrating!'

Despite winning Commonwealth silver in Delhi four years ago, the Hearts fan has spent her career largely in the shadow of Perri Shakes-Drayton.

The Londoner beat her to the British title in for three years running from 2011 before Child finally upgraded to gold this year, in the absence of her injured rival.

Child reached the semi-finals at London 2012 before coming home fifth at last year's World Championships in Moscow, but even that achievement was overshadowed by the serious knee injury suffered by Shakes-Drayton in the same race.

But Child demonstrated her credentials with an impressive win in the Diamond League meeting on this very track earlier this month and the Edinburgh University graduate was able to add another medal to her collection.

The gods appeared to be smiling on Child when the heavens opened to deliver some typical Scottish weather, but it had eased by the time she took to the track and Spencer was not affected.

Child said: 'I will cherish this silver medal because I'm happy with the way I performed.

'It wasn't the fastest race I've run but there was a lot of expectation and I've coped with that.

'I always said I can't control what other people can do - that's the reality in sport. I tried to shut out the crowd a bit beforehand and concentrate on what I had to do.

'Afterwards it was amazing and the lap of honour was something very special.'
