Renovation: The 3C-Check took place in Dubai after the aircraft had flown 3,000 flights

The event took place in Dubai after the plane had flown about 3,000 flights and carried roughly 1.2 million passengers since being delivered to Emirates in July, 2008.

Each of the four engines were also removed, inspected and overhauled. 

The video shows a sped up version of exactly what it takes to complete the 3C-Check, and it's clearly no mean task.

Hoards of workers are needed to dismantle the crescent bar near first class. Next, the business class seats are dismantled and removed.
