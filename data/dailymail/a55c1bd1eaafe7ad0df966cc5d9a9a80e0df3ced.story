A 20-year-old bride-to-be stabbed an unarmed teenager to death on her doorstep after sending text messages about how to kill someone ‘legally’, a court has heard.

Rebecca Tootle allegedly grabbed a knife and attacked Ashley Meadowcroft, 18, in a confrontation at her home in Blackburn after the teenager was said to have turned up there with his pitbull dog.

The court was told yesterday that she had earlier sent a text saying: ‘I’d love to see him break into my house when I’m there because three legal marks on me and I can actually kill him [sic].’

She later falsely claimed Mr Meadowcroft had been armed with the blade and even gave herself scratch marks which she wrongly alleged occurred when she wrestled the knife off him, it was said.

As police in the Lancashire town detained Tootle, she allegedly said: ‘He’s a f****** d***. He’s stabbed me so I took the knife off him and stabbed him (in) self-defence. He could have killed me. He could have definitely killed my fiancé. He broke into my address. I didn’t do it on purpose.’

Mr Meadowcroft, a former former friend of Tootle, suffered a fatal knife wound near his left armpit which penetrated his lung - and he died in hospital 45 minutes later despite attempts to save him.

Preston Crown Court heard Tootle - who was living with her fiancé Matthew Moran and two other friends - had fallen out with Mr Meadowcroft and the group had moved house to get away from him.

She claimed she had ‘loads of trouble’ with the teenager - alleging he had stalked her, robbed her and tried to rape her. In the run up to the killing, Tootle sent three messages on her mobile phone.

The last of these, to her father, read: ‘Here’s an interesting fact, you come into my house when I’ve told you not to and I’m in the house thress [sic] marks on myself and I can legally kill you.’

The killing took place last September after Mr Meadowcroft arrived at Tootle’s home with his dog Leo after she and two housemates had been smoking the legal high drug ‘Happy Joker,’ it was said.

Mr Meadowcroft was said be ‘extremely agitated and irate’ and one of Tootle’s housemates Julian Doyle claimed the teenager was ‘provoking’ the dog into barking and growling.

He was shouting up at a bedroom window demanding to speak to Mr Moran and saying: ‘I’ll (let) the dog have every one of you.’

Tootle went downstairs and opened the front door but as the dog ran into the property she came back saying: ‘He tried to stab me - I think I’ve stabbed him.’

Paul Reid QC, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘She showed a small mark on one of her arms and was saying: "I had to take the knife off him because he’s mental".

‘But Ashley Meadowcroft never had a knife, he did not try to stab the defendant and he caused her no injury to her arm. The defendant was lying about all these matters within a short time of her having plunged the knife into Ashley Meadowcroft’s chest.

‘It was a knife she had armed herself with from somewhere in the house before she went to confront Ashley Meadowcroft.

‘The marks and scratches were self-inflicted by the defendant in the moments before the police arrived to cause them to falsely believe that Ashley Meadowcroft was the aggressor with the knife - when in fact the truth was just the opposite.

Trial: Preston Crown Court (above) heard Tootle - who was living with her fiancé Matthew Moran and two other friends - had fallen out with Mr Meadowcroft and the group had moved house to get away with him

‘The idea that a few marks on her would justify her in killing someone who had come into her house was not something that had just occurred to her that night.

‘She had previously spoken about this is messages which police extracted from her mobile phone. On the night of the killing, she was quick to make some marks on her skin so as to be able to justify to the police her right to attack him.

‘You will probably conclude Ashley Meadowcroft was not welcome that night, but nothing that he did justified the defendant in arming herself with the knife and plunging (it) into his body.’

In a statement to police Mr Moran - known as ‘Mos’ - had claimed Mr Meadowcroft had been holding the dog by its collar with a chain wrapped around his knuckles.

He claimed he went to speak to Mr Meadowcroft but had been threatened with the chain before the teenager attempted to barge past him into the house. Mr Moran fled upstairs only to hear a female shout: ‘He’s got a knife.’

Moments later Mr Meadowcroft was heard shouting: ‘You just stabbed me’ before being seen stumbling backwards down the front path and collapsing.

The court heard in a 999 call minutes before the stabbing, Tootle told an operator: ‘I need police.

'There’s a lad here with a knife and he’s kicking off, he’s banging on the door, he’s got a vicious dog with him, he’s taken it off, he’s whacking the chain with him, he’s threatening to beat my friend up.’

In a second 999 call she added: 'He’s got an American pitbull with him - an illegal dog - and he’s threatening to use it.’

Held: Tootle was said to have made a number of ‘unsolicited comments’ to police as she was questioned

She then handed over the phone to Mr Doyle before being overheard saying: ‘No Matt, f****** sort it out now, don’t just f****** stand there talking.’

The call ended when the victim was heard screaming: ‘Help me, help me, I’ve been stabbed.’  Mr Reid said Tootle made a number of ‘unsolicited comments’ to police as she was questioned.

At a police station she said: ‘The things you’ll do for people - you get arrested for self defence’ and she said she hoped Mr Meadowcroft would be ‘getting arrested when he comes of out of hospital’.

When told she was being held for murder, Tootle retorted: ‘He’s died?'

She added: ‘I stabbed him. If I didn’t it would have been me or my boyfriend. I did it, yeah, but he came into the house. It was unlocked and he had an illegal dog.

‘What if it was me or Mos? I heard the door smash. I went down and he had a knife in his hand. Mos was holding his wrist. I grabbed hold of his hand and tried to get the knife and it went in. If I intended to kill him, I would have stabbed him in the heart.’

She also showed a superficial scratch on her left forearm to a nurse who examined her and said: ‘That’s what happened when I tried to get the knife off Ash.’

She later gave a no comment interview but issued a prepared statement through her lawyer. The knife was found in a garden next door. 

Tootle now admits Mr Meadowcroft never had the knife but she denies murder. The trial continues.
