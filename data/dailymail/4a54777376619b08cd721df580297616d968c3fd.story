It's the iconic item of clothing that's almost more famous than the Danish TV series in which it is worn. It even has it's own fan website. And now there are two more varieties to choose from.

The Scandinavian knitwear company behind the handmade patterned wooly sweaters so beloved of The Killing's detective Sarah Lund have released two new cosy chunk-knit tops, as worn by her in the upcoming third series of the cult TV show.

Gudrun and Gudrun - whose unique sweaters are hand-knitted by women of the Faroe islands using 100 per cent organic native wool, known for it's incredibly warm qualities - will no doubt be making a killing on the two jumpers: blue and white snowflake, and diagonal white grey and black stripes.

The jumpers - which retail from around 300 Euro (£243)  - worn by detective Sarah Lund (played by Danish actress Sofie Gråbøl) have become a trademark of the show, and the company expect to see sales figures soar when the third and final series begins on Saturday on BBC Four.

The Killing is a Danish series which follows the police murder investigation thorough a series of interlocking stories and red herrings.

The Faroese jumpers worn by lone wolf Sarah Lund are knitted on the island group and archipelago which sits under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark and is situated between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland.

The unusual patterns stitched into the sweaters are a traditional Faroese marking, originally used by the fishermen's wives to distinguish their husbands as they approached the shore after long periods working at sea.

So popular have the jumpers become that the crime drama has released knitting patterns for them. They even have their own fan website. Sofie Gråbøl recently gifted one to the Duchess of Cornwall.

Many of the pieces are made from untreated and undyed Faroese wool, taken from sheep who reside in the mountains all year round live on unfertilised grass, making the wool incredibly soft.
