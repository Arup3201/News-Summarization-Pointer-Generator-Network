Happy Mondays dancer Bez is planning to stand for election as an MP, he revealed today.

The maraca-shaking star revealed plans to contest Salford in Greater Manchester on a platform of ending war, cancer and ‘evil being the main policy’.

The one-time Celebrity Big Brother winner said he wanted to 'stir things up' in the battle to succeed former Labour Cabinet minister Hazel Blears.

The 49-year-old said he wants to end war and 'evil as a policy'

The 49-year-old is still best known for his role as the dancing mascot of Shaun Ryder’s band Happy Mondays, and later Black Grape.

He plans to launch his political career with a visit to support anti-fracking protesters at Barton Moss in Salford this weekend.

He said: ‘I've been saying we need a revolution and there's no good shouting about it when you're not actually doing anything.

‘If you want to do something about things you've got to get into the corridors of power and take them on.’

The keen beekeeper said he wants to create a 'permacultural society where we'll end illness' including dementia and cancer

Since his Madchester heyday, Bez has branched out including revealing his love of beekeeping.

He said one of policies would be a ‘permacultural society where we'll end illness and get everybody back to an alkaline state’ including tackling cancer and dementia.

The Manchester United fan said he wanted to end the banking system, confiscating wealth and redistributing it to the poor.

He told the Manchester Evening News: ‘If you're voting for me, you're voting as a protest about what's happening in the world at the moment.

‘I'm going to create a new world order and get rid of them and start again with a new, fairer system without evil being the main policy.’

He also wants to end 'all war' and put a stop to 'divide and rule' strategies.

Pressed on what he hopes to achieve for Salford – where he was born and grew up - he admitted: ‘‘I don't know yet, I'm in the midst of writing it up.

‘I've got lots of meetings with different people next week.’

He is expected to stand as an independent candidate in Salford, a safe Labour seat which will become vacant when Ms Blears stands down at the election.

Protesters have descended on a test drilling site at Barton Moss to oppose fracking. Bez is expected to visit the camp on Sunday before joining environmental campaigners as they walk in front of energy firm IGas's lorries to slow their entry into the site on Monday.

He said: ‘I've always supported it quietly but I'm going along because people have put a lot of time and effort into protesting against an unsafe technology.

‘I believe in free energy and there's alternative energy sources out there but the bankers and the people in charge don't want to use them.’
