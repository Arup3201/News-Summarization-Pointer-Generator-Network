Manchester United misfit Bebe is wanted by Sporting Braga.

The 23-year-old has made seven appearances for United since signing for £7.3million from Vitoria de Guimaraes in 2010 yet has enjoyed a successful loan season at Pacos de Ferreira, scoring 12 goals in 27 games.

Bebe's latest effort came last week as the frontman scored a cracking free kick against Desportivo Aves.

The delicately-hit right-foot shot proved to be pretty crucial, too.

With the aggregate scoreline poised at 0-0 in the second leg of a relegation play-off Bebe sparked a 3-1 win which ensured Pacos remain in the top flight.

Manchester United signed Bebe in 2010 for £7.4million, despite then-boss Sir Alex Ferguson admitting he has never seen him play.

Bebe has failed to start a Premier League match for the Red Devils.
