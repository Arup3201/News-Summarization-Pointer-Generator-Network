The NFL has said there's noting wrong with a pair of refs celebrating a Broncos touchdown Sunday with a fist bump. 

C.J. Anderson had just pushed in for his second touchdown of the game against Buffalo on the way to Denver's 24-17 win when the controversial gesture between officials on the field was caught on camera. 

Line judge John Hussey and umpire Carl Paganelli made the move after the score.

Buffalo Bills safety Aaron Williams was so offended by the move that we took to Twitter after the game.

'No excuse for my performance but can't win playing 16 vs 11 thought I seen it all Smh,' he wrote along with a clip of the bump.

Williams alludes the the question of how refs should have called Anderson's rush through the center line as it would have been difficult for Hussey to see whether the ball was in before Anderson's knee was down.

Paganelli is supposed to help make a fair call. 

Before the bump, Paganelli flashed Hussey a thumbs up, followed by Hussey signaling for a touchdown. 

A replay confirmed the decision just moments later. 

ESPN notes that there are nine officials for NFL games, and that that would technically make it '20 vs. 11.' 

'The NFL doesn't want legalized betting because their refs would probably get caught more often,' wrote fan Frank Brank ‏on Twitter.

'LRT: I have never seen refs fist bump each other before. I swear these refs are all for the Broncos,' wrote user Samantha Willhauck. 

But the NFL says the gesture was fine.

'It was an acknowledgment of good mechanics between the two officials involved in making the call,' said Michael Signora, an NFL spokesman.
