There is a story about Felix Magath hiding water bottles from his players when they returned from punishing cross-country training runs during his spell at Wolfsburg.

On Thursday, the eccentric German defended his controversial methods.

‘Until now everybody loves my training - nobody died,’ he said, without a hint of remorse.

Writing's on the wall: Magath makes himself at home in Fulham's changing room

‘Ask Raul about my work. Ask the good players and you will get the right answers.

‘Why should I change my training? I am the most successful coach in Germany.’

That
 is not entirely accurate, but he did win the Bundesliga with Bayern 
Munich and Wolfsburg during his long and varied coaching career.

Magath,
 60, has also never been relegated, a statistic that will appeal to 
Fulham as they stare up at the 19 clubs above them in the Barclays 
Premier League.

The 
German confirmed that his appointment was conducted behind Rene 
Meulensteen’s back, with meetings arranged after Fulham drew 2-2 with 
Manchester United on February 9 at Old Trafford.

Two
 days later Magath arrived in London to meet Fulham’s owner Shahid Khan,
 who had flown in from Jacksonville to survey the wreckage of 
Meulensteen’s 75-day spell in charge of the club.

Short stay: Alan Curbishley was also relieved from his short-lived stint as Director of Football

Magath cancelled the players’ day off last Sunday to take them for a training session.

He also took full responsibility for dismissing the coaching staff, including Alan Curbishley.

‘Curbishley
 is a very good manager and he gave me some information on West Brom but
 I decided to make the cut,’ he said. ‘I have also been sacked many 
times.

‘If you want to send a signal that it’s starting from the beginning you have to send someone away.

‘I’m sorry, but that is a must if Fulham are to avoid relegation.’

Celebration: Magath asked critics to speak to legendary striker Raul for praise of his training methods

This
 is Magath’s 12th managerial appointment and arguably his most 
demanding, with Fulham lying four points short of safety in the top 
flight.

He has demanded six victories and doesn’t care how they come. All that counts is keeping this team in the Premier League.

‘The most important thing for me is to get the players together and to work as fast as we can,’ he said. 

‘That’s why I called them in on Sunday. We have no time to get to know each other.’
