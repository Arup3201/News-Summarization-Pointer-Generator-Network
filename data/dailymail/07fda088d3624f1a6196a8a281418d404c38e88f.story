A 'rock star' economist who wrote a bestselling book about the growing wealth gap between the rich and poor appears to have got his sums wrong.

Thomas Piketty, 42, included a number of errors and spreadsheets in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which has dominated book charts around the world in recent weeks.

The 577-page thesis, which claims wealth inequality has been soaring since the First World War, uses a huge amount of statistics as evidence. 

But an investigation found there were errors in transcripts from original sources and incorrect forumulaes.

Thomas Piketty, 42, is believed to have included mistakes in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which claims wealth inequality is soaring. He says he made it clear that some of the data needed to be changed

For example, his figures claim wealth became more concentrated in Britain during the 1980s, but his sources do not back it up.

He is also alleged to have cherry-picked some of the information. 

When The Financial Times stripped down the data, they found that there was no evidence of rising wealth inequality from 1970.

In the book, he urges that income taxes should be increased to 80pc on earnings in excess of either £300,000 or £500,000 a year.

There are claims the French economist 'cherry-picked' information to include in the 577-page thesis, which suggests the gap between rich and poor has been increasing since the First World War

He also suggests a global 
wealth tax, imposed at the rate of 1 per cent a year on fortunes of 
£600,000 to £3 million, up to as much as 10 per cent for those earning 
more than a billion.

Defending
 the claims, Professor Piketty said he has made it clear that some of 
the statistics need changing and has published his work online so it can
 be altered in the future.

He said: 'As I make clear in the book, in the online appendix, and in 
the many technical papers I have published on this topic, one needs to 
make a number of adjustments to the raw data sources so as to make them 
more homogenous over time and across countries.

'I have tried in the context of this book to make the most justified choices and arbitrages about data sources and adjustments.

The top line shows how much of British wealth is concentrated in the top 10 per cent of income earners and the bottom refers to the top 1 per cent. The yellow line represents Piketty's estimates whereas the blue lines represent the aggregate of figures collated from a number of financial bodies. The discrepancy between Piketty's sums increases after 1970 with large gaps in the data in 2010

'I have no doubt that my historical data series can be improved and will be improved in the future.'

'But
 I would be very surprised if any of the substantive conclusion about 
the long run evolution of wealth distributions was much affected by 
these improvements.

He also argues that the rise in top wealth shares in the US in recent decades has been even larger than what he shows in his book.

The work has received plaudits from economists and politicians around the world. 

Ed Miliband told the Evening Standard: 
'I’m in the early stages of the book. In a way, he is symptomatic of 
what people are actually feeling'.

Nobel Prize-winner Paul Krugman from Princeton University said: 'It will be the most important economics book of the year.'
