Pop singer Jennifer Lopez may be
 thinking life is funny after some scientists gave her name to a water 
mite species they discovered near Puerto Rico.

Biologist Vladimir Pesic of the University of Montenegro said in an email on Wednesday that the group was entertained during its research by the music of the Bronx, New York-born artist who has Puerto Rican roots.

Pesic calls it a small token of gratitude for the singer of hits such as 'I Luh Ya Papi,' 'All I Have,' and 'Ain't It Funny.'

Scientists decided to name a newly discovered mite after Jennifer Lopez because they were listening to her songs while writing their scientific journal

See the resemblance? The Litarachna Lopezae has been named after Jennifer Lopez because the scientists who discovered it enjoy her music

Pesic is the corresponding author of the study published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed online journal ZooKeys.

The Journal humorously states their reasoning for naming the mite after the popular Latin pop star.

'The reason behind the unusual choice of name for the new species that J.Lo's songs and videos kept the team in a continuous good mood when writing the manuscript and watching World Cup Soccer 2014,'said the lead author Vladimir Pešić, Department of Biology, University of Montenegro.

He and other scientists collected the newly baptized Litarachna Lopezae water mite from a coral reef in Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

Science Daily reports that nothing is known about the life cycle of the animals.

The new J.Lo species was collected nearly 70 m deep. It is the greatest depth from which Pontarachnid mites have been found until now.

The Science Daily reports that the Mesophotic coral ecosystems are a biodiversity hotspot for marine life--especially those named after Latin pop stars.

Scientists may have discovered a small mite but they named it after Jennifer Lopez, one of the world's biggest stars
