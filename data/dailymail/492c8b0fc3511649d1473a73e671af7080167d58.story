She may have walked the earth thousands of years ago, but this woman was clearly as fond of a nice piece of jewellery as the average 21st Century girl.

The female skeleton, which is believed to date back to between 1550 and 1250BC, was discovered in Oechlitz, south of Halle in eastern Germany, while construction was underway to build a new rail track.

The Middle Bronze Age woman had been buried wearing an elaborate headband made up of tiny bronze spirals.

Staff at the State Museum of Prehistory in Halle, where the skeleton is now on display as part of its permanent exhibition, said similar spirals uncovered in the past had been found separate and loose.

Tomoko Emmerling, the museum's press officer, said the discovery gave historians an insight into how the spirals were worn in the Middle Bronze Age.

The ancient skeleton, which was excavated within a block in 2008, went on display at the German museum today.

It is among thousands of artefacts in a new section of its permanent exhibition entitled 'Glutgeboren', or 'Born in Embers'.

The display includes items from the middle and late Bronze Age as well as from the pre-Roman Iron Age.

Mysterious: The State Museum of Prehistory in Halle is also home to the Nebra Sky Disk, which dates back to the early Bronze Age and is thought to have been an astronomical instrument
