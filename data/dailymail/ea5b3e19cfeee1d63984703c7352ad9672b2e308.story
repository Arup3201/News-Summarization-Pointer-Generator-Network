Londoners will be able to rent out their homes like a hotel under plans to abolish 40 year old laws which ban renting out properties for less than three months.

It means those in the capital will be able to use holiday websites such as Airbnb - which allow homeowners to rent out their properties to visiting tourists on a daily rate basis - without fearing the law.

Property laws currently state that 
Londoners must apply for planning permission if they want to rent out 
their property for less than three months.

However, many already advertise their homes on the site and British company One Fine Stay.

Londoners will be able to turn their homes into 'hotels' on sites such as Airbnb under plans to abolish 40 year old laws which ban renting out properties for less than three months

Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, told the Telegraph: 'It's
 time to change the outdated, impractical and restrictive laws from the 
Seventies, open up London's homes to visitors and allow Londoners to 
make some extra cash.'

The home sharing sites are becoming increasingly popular with holidaymakers who are looking for a cheaper alternative to hotels.

They are also popular with those who often spend time away from home - meaning they can let their empty property and make some money at the same time.

While councils have been concerned that short term lets affect the sense of community and increase crime and littering, Mr Pickles said the change in the law, under the Deregulation Bill, will not allow people to turn their homes into hotels or hostels without applying for change of use planning permission.

Measures will also be taken to ensure that homes intended for Londoners are not solely being used for short–term lettings.

In 2012, those looking to rent out their properties to foreigners staying during the Olympics without seeking proper permission were threatened with fines of up to £20,000.

The latest guidance comes after home owners have been allowed to
 rent out their driveways without seeking official permission.

Airbnb was launched in San Francisco in 2008.

Since then more than 15million owners have used the site to advertise rooms or apartments.

In New York State most properties are prohibited from being used for short–term lets. 

But the apartment-sharing site won a huge court battle last month when the New York Supreme Court quashed a subpoena from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office seeking user's personal information.

And legislation set to be unveiled in San Francisco would make it legal for city residents to rent out their homes on sites such as Airbnb, but only if they have liability insurance and meet other requirements.
