Brendan Rodgers insisted Liverpool will not endure another summer of wholesale change as he outlined his intention to keep plenty of experience in his squad.

Steven Gerrard will leave a hole that cannot be easily filled when he joins LA Galaxy at the end of the season and Rodgers admits Liverpool can ill-afford more key departures.

Players such as Jon Flanagan (22), Kolo Toure (33), Glen Johnson (30) and Brad Jones (32) are all in the final six months of their current deals, while Jordan Henderson (24) and Martin Skrtel (30) are established squad members whose terms expire in 18 months.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will, however, leave the club at the end of the season

Rodgers has already said he wants Johnson to stay and Lucas Leiva, the 28-year-old Brazil midfielder who has been courted by Inter Milan, is another player the manager wants to keep as he shapes a squad to challenge for the title.

‘We can’t have (three or four leaving),’ said Rodgers, whose side face Bolton at Anfield on Saturday.

‘You have to realise that if you want success, you have to be unselfish. You have to think about the team. The manager picks the team to win the game.

‘You have to recognise as a manager that it is difficult for players who don’t play.

Rodgers insists he wants midfielder Lucas Leiva, who is being targeted by Inter Milan, to stay

Glen Johnson is another player who could leave at the end of the season

‘I speak a lot with the players but I have shown in my time here that I’m a coach who will view (what you do) in training. Lucas is a prime example.’

Liverpool bought predominantly young players last summer but their interest in, among others, 29-year-old Manchester City midfielder James Milner shows they will broaden their horizons if necessary.

‘I think for younger players to show that potential, they are going to need that seniority around them,’ Rodgers added.

‘You cannot just rely on young players. Players like Glen Johnson we want to keep. Lucas we want to keep.’
