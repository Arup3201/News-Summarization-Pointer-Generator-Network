Nobu Hotels is gearing up to re-launch the Eden Roc Miami next year as the Nobu Hotel at Eden Roc Miami Beach.

Backed by Chef Nobu, Academy award-winner Robert De Niro and Hollywood producer Meir Teper, this will be the second American hotel under the Nobu Hospitality brand - and will also be home to the largest Nobu Restaurant and Bar Lounge in the world.

The multi-million dollar revitalisation project comes after a highly successful launch of the Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace Las Vegas in 2013.

The re-launched property will have 210 guest rooms, as well as a signature Nobu restaurant and bar.

There will also be a new beachfront restaurant, as well as new meeting and event spaces.

The 20,000 square foot spa and fitness facilities will likewise get a makeover and two luxurious pools will be added.

The 15th floor penthouse suites will draw inspiration from the Villa at the Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace - complete with a VIP entrance to the hotel pool and lounge and panoramic sea and city views.

These high-in-the-sky suites will be located in the hotel's legendary tower.

David Rockwell is leading the design of the project's interiors and will be paying special attention to lush, natural materials fused with contemporary style in a modern setting.

He will draw inspiration from both Japan and the hotel's spectacular beach location. 

The Eden Roc Hotel is located in north Miami Beach, right on famed Collins Ave.

This art of fusion is at the core of the Nobu brand and designers hope to add Nobu's lively aesthetic to the project, while remaining true to Eden Roc's classic heritage. 

The Nobu Hotel at Eden Roc is certainly not the only hospitality project in development for the trio. 

Hotels are also in development in London, Bahrain and Chicago,

The pair will redesign the iconic property - including adding the world's largest Nobu Restaurant and Bar

Beach, sea and pool views will all be enjoyed from the hotel's suites - especially the 15th floor penthouse

'We are excited to be putting the plans in place for the creation of an exceptional, luxury property at the iconic Eden Roc,' said Trevor Horwell, Chief Executive of Nobu Hospitality.

'We welcome being a partnership with the ownership of the Eden Roc in bringing the halo effect of the Nobu brand to recreate and relaunch this iconic property.

'Chef Nobu, Robert De Niro and Meir Teper are passionate to create a property that will intertwine fun and luxury to offer guests from around the world a unique and exciting Miami experience.'

De Niro himself is said to have fond memories of staying at the Eden Roc in the past - so it's no surprise he will be an active participant in such a re-vamp.
