The pleasure of growing sunflowers is about to reach new heights – with the arrival of a new seed that guarantees 17ft plants.

Green-fingered pensioner Victoria Wakefield has spent 30 years painstakingly developing a new species called 'Helianthus Giraffe' by selecting the seeds of the tallest sunflower from a crop and growing them on the following year.

She repeated the process over three decades until the sunflowers grew to an average height of 17ft.

The main reason for the bright yellow plant's dependable growth is that it doesn't flower until late August or early September, giving it all of the summer to grow.

While some other varieties have been known to grow to similar heights, they are rare and freak occurrences whereas the Giraffe variety is consistently tall.

Packets of seeds of the new species, described on the packet as 'possibly the tallest sunflower ever produced', have now gone on sale for £2.99.

Mrs Wakefield, 70, who is being credited with breeding Helianthus Giraffe on the packet but is not taking any royalties from the sales, who regularly opens the gardens at her Grade II listed house to the public under the National Garden Scheme.

She said yesterday: ‘In September time there wasn't a lot to see, especially for children, so I decided to start growing sunflowers.

‘As each year went by I used the seeds from the tallest one and planted them again the year later. I did this for 30 years until they consistently reached 17ft.

‘People are amazed at the size of them.’

Mrs Wakefield, from Bramdean, Hampshire, is a member of the Royal Horticultural Society's herbaceous plant committee and mentioned her project colleague Simon Crawford.

He sent a kilogram of the seeds to a production farm in Africa where they have been mass-grown for the British climate and the seeds from the flower heads placed in packets ready for sale.

Mr Crawford, 57, said: ‘Because it is sunny and dry in Africa it is great for flowers.

‘Each sunflower produced between 100 and 150 seeds so from the ones we planted we had millions.

‘The Giraffe is taller than other varieties because it only flowers when the days become shorter in September time, meaning it has much longer to grow than those that flower in June.’

Suttons Seeds in Paignton, Devon, has been given the exclusive rights to sell Helianthus Giraffe in the UK.

To ensure the sunflowers reach their potential, seeds need to be planted in April and spaced two feet apart.

Although the height on the front of packet states 15ft, a spokesman for Suttons said they may need to increase that figure in the near future.

He said: ‘The variety of sunflowers that are usually planted in the UK are the Giant Yellow, which reach an average of around 12ft tall.

‘The Giraffe variety will reach 17ft in height, possibly more, as long as they are sown in April, given the opportunity to climb and flower, and fed and watered regularly.’

He added: ‘These sunflowers are great for wildlife as they have pollen so they attract bees and other creatures.

‘The best thing about the Giraffe sunflowers is that they are British bred, they have been specifically grown in the UK climate.’
