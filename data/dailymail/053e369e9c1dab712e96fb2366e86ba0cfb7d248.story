Michael McIntyre's latest tour made him £21million, making him the most successful stand-up in the world

In an age of foul-mouthed and cruel  comedy, he is the funnyman known for his family-friendly jokes.

Now Michael McIntyre has certainly had the last laugh at the expense of critics who labelled his giggly, bouncy persona ‘too middle class’ – by being named the most successful stand-up in the world.

According to figures from ticket sales tracker Pollstar, the 36-year-old’s latest tour made him £21million.

More than 600,000 fans flocked to venues around the UK and Ireland to see Showtime!, McIntyre’s 71-date 2012 tour, which included 10 gigs at the massive O2 Arena in London.

His takings from live shows put him alongside the likes of the Rolling Stones, whose five-gig farewell tour netted £22million

McIntyre is the only comedian in the top 50 of Pollstar’s top 100 Worldwide Tours of 2012 list, making him the global stand-up king. He was 36th in the list, which was headed by Madonna, who made £184million from her world tour.

His box-office earnings outstrip those of rival British comedians, such as Peter Kay, whose 2011 gigs netted just over £20million, and Lee Evans, whose ticket sales hit nearly £13million the same year.

McIntyre lives in a £3.7million home in Hampstead, North London, with his wife Kitty and their sons Lucas and Oscar. But he  struggled on the comedy circuit for ten years, earning £160 a gig, before breaking through in 2006 with a successful appearance at the Royal Variety Performance

He has won over audiences with his brand of humour, much of it based around jokes that involve digs at himself or his family.

Top-earners: McIntyre earned more than the likes of Peter Kay, Alan Carr and Russell Howard

In one gag, he mocked his wife’s love of expensive handbags, saying he told her: ‘For £500 I can hire a human being to walk alongside you holding your lipstick, your keys and your phone.’

To his £21million in box-office takings last year, he can add earnings from his autobiography, regular television appearances and DVDs of his live performances.

The Showtime! DVD was a sell-out over Christmas, topping HMV’s comedy chart. His 2008 debut DVD, Live And Laughing, was the fastest selling of all time until beaten by his second, Hello Wembley, which sold 1.4 million copies.
