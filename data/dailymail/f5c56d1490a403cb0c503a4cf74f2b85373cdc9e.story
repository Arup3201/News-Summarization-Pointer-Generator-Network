Gibraltar's chief minister yesterday accused Spain’s prime minister of behaving like Argentine dictator General Galtieri as Spanish officials again blocked the border.

Fabian Picardo said Mariano Rajoy was fuelling the crisis to distract from his domestic troubles – just as the military junta in Buenos Aires did by ordering the invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982.

He spoke out as the Foreign Office announced that it is lodging another formal complaint with Spain over the latest ‘unacceptable’ delays at the border with Gibraltar.

One the move: HMS Westminster sets sail for Gibraltar en route to a pre-planned international training exercise Cougar in the Mediterranean and Gulf

Checks: Motorists queue at the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar in La Linea de la Concepcion. Irate drivers waited up to five hours to enter Gibraltar, some even pushing their cars to save fuel

Yesterday travellers, including a pregnant woman, were forced to wait for between three and five hours in baking heat.

David Cameron is expected to decide 
today or tomorrow whether to sue Spain in the European Court of Justice 
over its imposition of draconian border controls.

Mr Picardo said: ‘I think what we are 
seeing is a little bit like what Mr Galtieri deployed in Argentina in 
1982, which is an attempt to bang the nationalistic drum to make people 
look away from the national problems that Spain is suffering and the PM 
himself is labouring under.

‘What is happening in the background 
is that the Spanish government has been engulfed in allegations of 
corruption which affect Mr Rajoy himself.’

Threat: David Cameron has raised the prospect of taking legal action against Spain for delays at the border

Delays: Traffic builds up on the Spanish side of the border. The Royal Gibraltar Police said the wait had been around three hours

Mr Rajoy has had to deny that he 
accepted illegal payments from a political slush fund, while the 
country’s economy is a disaster area.

Mr Picardo said a British prime 
minister facing the same allegations as Mr Rajoy ‘wouldn’t last five 
minutes – and yet in Spain Mr Rajoy remains comfortable in his post 
trying to create diversions like this one’.

Last night Ignacio Ibanez, the 
director general for foreign affairs at Spain’s foreign ministry, upped 
the rhetoric further by insisting that Spain would eventually succeed in
its claim to recover Gibraltar from Britain.

‘We are confident that in the end that we will have Gibraltar as part of Spain,’ he told Channel 4 News.

Mr Ibanez dismissed the threat of 
legal action, insisting the controls were imposed in response to an 
upsurge in smuggling of tobacco and other items.

‘Regarding Gibraltar, things are going
in a very bad way mainly, we think, because of the attitude of the 
Gibraltan authorities,’ he said.

‘We are confident we are doing what we have to do. I’m confident that reason is on our side.

A task force, including the aircraft 
carrier Illustrious and two frigates, set sail from Portsmouth on Monday
for a long-planned exercise in the Mediterranean.

The frigate HMS Westminster, which 
left Portsmouth yesterday, is due to dock in Gibraltar between Monday 
and Wednesday next week along with two support vessels.

Yesterday Pedro Pitarch, a retired 
Spanish general and former head of defence policy, accused the Spanish 
government of taking an ‘overly passive’ stance and called on them to 
prevent the ships docking.

The Royal Gibraltar Police said 
drivers had to queue for around three hours yesterday to enter 
Gibraltar, although there were no delays leaving. Some motorists said 
they were kept waiting five hours.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture committee, who was visiting Gibraltar yesterday, condemned the delays.

‘One of my colleagues over here who works with the Gibraltar government was telling me his wife is pregnant,’ he said.

‘For a pregnant lady to have to endure
that kind of condition is intolerable. There does seem to be a steady 
escalation in measures being taken.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We 
will be protesting to the ministry of foreign affairs about the 
unacceptable delays seen this morning at the border with Gibraltar.’
