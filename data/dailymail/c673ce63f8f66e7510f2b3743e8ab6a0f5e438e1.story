Just four months after celebrating lifting Super Bowl XLVIII in New Jersey, mood in the Seattle Seahawks' camp has changed significantly as a training session descended into a brawl.

The Seahawks' offence and defence came to blows when Earl Thomas landed on wide receiver Bryan Walters.

Richard Sherman and Phil Bates then got into a fistfight and players jumped in to support differing sides.

It was just the second day of the Seahawks' pre-season mini-camp but the dedication and passion shown by the players was evident.

Sherman and Bates are great friends off the field and made up by the end of the training session.

Speaking about the intensity of the session, linebacker Bobby Wagner told Fox News: 'I think that's what makes us great, you know.

'Not that many teams will go that hard at mini-camp but we go that hard every time we step on the field and that's the reason why we did what we did (and won the Super Bowl).'

And wide receiver Paul Richardson agreed.

He said: 'I think that's just the competitive nature that we have.

'All of us are competitors, all of us like to compete at a high level and sometimes tempers flare.'
