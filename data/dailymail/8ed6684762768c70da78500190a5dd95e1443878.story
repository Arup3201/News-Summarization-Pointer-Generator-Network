A former cheerleader with the New York Jets has sued the team, claiming she and others were underpaid in violation of New Jersey state wage laws.

California-based attorney Sharon 
Vinick says she and other members of the Jets Flight Crew earned $150 
per game and $100 for required special events.

But the 25-year-old dancer, identified on court papers as Krystal C. says they weren't paid for practices, transportation or other appearances.

Vinick says when the unpaid hours are factored in the $1,700 per season works out to $3.77 per hour.

Krystal C. told The New York Post: 'We worked so much and it was so time-consuming.

'We are professional dancers and we should be compensated that way. I needed to speak up about this, it's not fair for people trying out for the squad, who think it's going to be glamorous.'

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in state Superior Court in Bergen County, where the Jets and the New York Giants play their home games at MetLife Stadium.

New Jersey minimum wage is $8.25 an hour, which Krystal C. says the cheerleaders deserve to be paid.

She is seeking damages for the unpaid wages and back-pay for work-related expenses.

Vinick also represents cheerleaders with the Oakland Raiders in a similar lawsuit.

A Jets spokesman won't comment on the lawsuit.

The case follows a suit filed by five Buffalo Bills cheerleaders against the NFL team last month, who claimed they weren't paid for their time at games or mandatory public appearances - equating to '840 hours of work' between them.

The Oakland Raiders and Cincinnati Bengals cheerleaders also have pending wage battles.
