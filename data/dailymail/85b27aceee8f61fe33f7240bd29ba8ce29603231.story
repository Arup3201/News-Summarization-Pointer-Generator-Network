Amanda Spencer, 23, arrives at Sheffield Crown Court where she was found guilty of 16 child prostitution offences against five girls - some as young as 11

Care staff knew about the crimes of a young woman who began grooming vulnerable underage girls at the age of 15 five years before she faced justice, reports today suggest.

Amanda Spencer, 23, befriended girls, some as young as 11, on the streets of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, before luring them into a life of prostitution.

Spencer would offer the vulnerable girls, many of whom were in care, a shoulder to cry on - before piling them with drink and drugs and forcing them to have sex with various men.

She would then become aggressive if they refused to have intercourse with men in flats around Sheffield, in the city's Castle Markets and the toilets of nearby McDonald's and KFC restaurants, the court was told.

Following a six-week trial, Spencer was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution against five girls between 2006 and 2011.

Today, it was claimed that care workers may have know about her crimes as early as June 2009 when a girl, then 14, allegedly told authorities she had been 'forced to have sex with an Asian male.'

According to The Times, a confidential South Yorkshire Police report suggests staff at the teen's care home recorded she was 'very frightened of Amanda and had sex with male as Spencer said she would assault her if she did not'

The newspaper suggests the 2010 report also details how the girl was forced to engage in sexual activity with Asian men for just Â£10.

The girl was one of the five whose accounts of Spencer's abuse led to the 23-year-old's conviction earlier this week. Of the 14 charges she was found guilty of, four related to the 14-year-old.

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'South Yorkshire Police take child exploitation cases extremely seriously as has been demonstrated by the 3-year-long investigation into Amanda Spencer and her associates.

'We are not able to comment further on this allegedly leaked report, especially as the case may still be the subject of a serious case review.'

After 30 hours of juror deliberations, Spencer was cleared of a further three counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and was also cleared of three counts of causing or inciting child prostitution.

Spencer was cleared of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation along with co-accused Kareem Ahmed, 30,

One of the men Spencer forced the girls to have sex with Ian Foster, 69, was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault on underage girls and one sexual assault on an adult.

A confidential police report suggests care home staff were told about Spencer's crimes by a victim, then 14, as early as June 2009. The teen was one of the five girls whose accounts led to Spencer's conviction earlier this week

Lee Unwin, 27, was cleared of paying for the sexual service of a child. Bashdar Hamadamin, 26, was cleared of a charge of rape.

John McLachlan, 65, who was accused of paying for the sexual services of a child, died midway through the trial.

Jurors could not reach verdicts on 14 counts against Spencer and were discharged from their duties.

Spencer and Foster are to be sentenced together on May 6.

Following Spencer's conviction on Thursday, Judge Michael Murphy QC remanded Spencer in custody - telling her the crimes she had been convicted of were 'very serious'.

Spencer was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution against between 2006 and 2011

He said: 'Expect an immediate and lengthy prison term.'

Previously, Michelle Colborne, prosecuting, told the court Spencer would tell the girls to lie about their age and dress provocatively.

She would then pocket the cash earned by the girls, seeing it as 'far more productive and profitable to co-ordinate a pool of prostitutes, than to work for drug money all by herself'.

Miss Colborne said: 'Many of the victims in this case were in the care system or marked as "missing from home" at the relevant time, those still at home experiencing difficulties to varying degrees.

'All were lacking in self-esteem and the wherewithal or sense to protect themselves from exploitation.'

She added: 'Amanda Spencer was a fraud, say the prosecution. She hung around the town centre identifying and befriending vulnerable children.

'She made them feel loved, she gave them a shoulder to cry on, a friend who purported to understand whatever sadness they were experiencing in their lives and in turn lured them into a life of abuse, which she exploited and profited from.

'She referred to them as her sisters or cousins when asked to account for who they were by people in authority.

'Although the children knew they were being sold for cash, their own drug and alcohol addiction sere so entrenched that they were incapable to extricate themselves.

'She told them how to dress more provocatively, to lie about their age and to close their minds to the reality of the sexual experiences, concentrating instead on the drugs.

'Those who had the temerity to refuse to do as they were instructed felt her wrath. She was violent and they were frightened of her.'
