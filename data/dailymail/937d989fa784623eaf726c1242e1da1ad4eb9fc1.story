Fresh scandal: Dominique Strauss Kahn was still head of the IMF at the time of the alleged attacks

Dominique Strauss-Kahn faces gang rape charges following a prostitute's claims she was held down by the wrists and forced to have sex, it emerged today.

The highly-paid vice girl said she was assaulted at Washington's W Hotel in December 2010, while Strauss-Kahn was still director of the International Monetary Fund.

Marie Anne S. and another young escort working for a prostitute ring in France were apparently flown to the U.S. with three Frenchmen to take part in ‘sex parties’ with them and Strauss-Kahn.

The Belgian prostitute claimed Strauss-Kahn tried to sodomise her, 
adding: ‘I refused and told him no, I don’t want to. I made it clear 
that I did not want to, several times out loud.’

Of another man in the group, the 25-year-old said: ‘He used force. He was holding my hand, he pulled my hair, he hurt me. I weigh 50 kilos, he’s heavier than me.’

The alleged ‘gang rape’ is set to form vital evidence in the 'Carlton Affair' - an investigation into a prostitute ring working out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, eastern France.

The judges working on the 'Carlton 
Affair' were looking at claims of pimping, the misuse of corporate 
assets, fraud and money-laundering, but have now asked prosecutors to widen their inquiry to gang rape, according to Liberation newspaper.

The prosecutors delayed their decision ‘so as 
not to disrupt the presidential election, Liberation reported.

The paper said the four men under investigation for the
rape include Strauss-Kahn, who has already been charged with aggravated
pimping in relation to the Carlton Affair.

Also under investigation are: Jean-Christophe Lagarde, a former police chief from Lille; David Roquet, head of a subsidiary of the Eiffage building giant;  and a businessman called Fabrice Paszkowski, who is said to have regularly exchanged SMS text messages with Strauss-Kahn. 

Another vice girl involved, identified as Aurelie D. confirmed that sexual acts took place at the party, saying of Marie-Anne S.: ‘I saw she did not like it. But I did not hear her say no. If she had shouted I would have heard her, and would have intervened.’ 

Both women were said to be posing as ‘secretaries for Eiffage’ and were paid 2,500 euros (£2,000) to go on the three-day trip.

'Pleading for help': The prostitute said she was held down and forced to have sex at Washington's W Hotel in December 2010

Disgraced: The unemployed 63-year-old is living in Paris with his third wife, the journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair

On December 16, the four men and two prostitutes retired to a suite at the W Hotel in Washington.

Roquet is said to have held the 
prostitute down by the wrists, while the other men are said to have 
ignored Marie-Anne’s pleas for help. 

Aurelie D., 26, admits that Marie-Anne may have ‘said no’, but she [Aurelie D.] was ‘too busy’ having sex to hear.

Strauss-Kahn, in turn, has told police that there was ‘no brutality’ involved in the orgy under investigation.

Earlier this week, the 63-year-old was denied diplomatic immunity from being sued over an alleged attempted rape of a New York chamber maid in May 2011.

Arrest: Dominique Strauss-Kahn was one of eight men, including a former Lille police commissioner, under investigation in connection with the illegal vice ring

Trial: Strauss-Kahn was this week denied diplomatic immunity from being sued over allegedly attempting to rape maid Nafissatou Diallo, 33, at Manhattan's Sofitel Hotel

In a ruling handed down in Bronx Supreme Court, Justice Douglas McKeon threw out a motion to have the civil case dismissed, raising the prospect of a New York trial.

Strauss-Kahn is accused of attempting to rape hotel employee Nafissatou Diallo, 33, at Manhattan’s Sofitel Hotel.

She claims that the married Frenchman ran at her naked, molested her and forced her to perform oral sex on him after she entered his suite to clean it.

The claims led to a criminal investigation against Strauss-Kahn and his house arrest in New York, but charges were dropped after prosecutors said there were 'substantial credibility issues' with the alleged victim.

At one stage, Strauss-Kahn was expected to be the Socialist candidate for the presidency of France this week, but the criminal allegations meant he had to give up his political ambitions.

He is currently unemployed and living in Paris with his third wife, the journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair.
