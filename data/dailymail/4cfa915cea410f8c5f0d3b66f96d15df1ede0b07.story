The International Association of Athletics Federations has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over the punishments handed out to six Russian drug cheats.

Athletics' world governing body said it disagreed with the 'selective disqualification of results' applied by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).

Race walkers Valeriy Borchin, Olga Kaniskina, Sergey Bakulin, Sergey Kirdyapkin and Vladimir Kanaykin and steeplechaser Yuliya Zaripova were all banned by RUSADA because of abnormalities in their biological passports.

Kirdyapkin and Zaripova were both gold medal winners at London 2012.

The IAAF said in a statement: 'While the IAAF agrees with RUSADA that there is, in each case, sufficient evidence of an anti-doping rule violation and that there are aggravating circumstances justifying an increased sanction of more than two years, the IAAF disagrees with the selective disqualification of results applied by RUSADA as a consequence of the previous rulings.'

The IAAF said the case of Tatyana Chernova, who beat Jessica Ennis-Hill to heptathlon gold at the 2011 World Championships but was later banned, was still under review.

It added: 'The decision with respect to the case of Tatyana Chernova, arising from the re-analysis of her urine sample collected at the World Championships in Berlin in 2009 and kept by the IAAF as part of its retesting strategy, is still under review.'
