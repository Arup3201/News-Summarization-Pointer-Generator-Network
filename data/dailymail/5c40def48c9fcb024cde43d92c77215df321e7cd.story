A Chinese school boy spent six days sleeping at an IKEA store and living off free food samples after he got in trouble with his mother when he didn’t do his homework.

Peng Yijian, from Shanghai in China, was sent home from school last Monday morning after his mother received a phone call by a teacher saying that he hadn’t done his maths assignment.

But the 12-year-old ran away from his Binnan Road home about 12.15pm following an argument with his mother, known as Liu.

Mrs Yijian told Shanghai Daily that her son only had 1.5 yuan (28 cents AUD) in his pocket when he left and reportedly survived off free food samples from the supermarkets.

The student from Longyuan Middle School was spotted by police on Tuesday afternoon at the IKEA outlet in Xuhui District and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Mrs Yijian said her son was ‘very weak with hunger’ when he was found near an escalator on the ground floor and has since received an intravenous drip.

The parents said they were grateful for all the help from everyone and promised to have better communications with their son in the future.

After the seventh grade student was reported missing last Tuesday, police found CCTV footage of the boy at Shanghai South Railway Station and Carrefour outlet.

‘We thought there might be other places he likes to visit, so we asked his mother,' police officer Sun Miao told Shanghai Daily.

‘She gave us eight or nine names, including Caoxi Park, Nanfang Shopping Mall, In Center and IKEA.'

Mrs Yijian also added that her son had previously run away before but was never gone for this long.
