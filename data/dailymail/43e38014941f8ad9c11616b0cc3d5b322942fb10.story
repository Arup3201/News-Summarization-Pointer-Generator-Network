Initially, there was stunned silence when Nikica Jelavic watched the World Cup draw at his pal Edin Dzeko’s place in December.

Dzeko’s Bosnia were pulled out to face Lionel Messi’s Argentina in the Maracana. The prize for Jelavic and Croatia was even more daunting; hosts Brazil in the tournament’s opening match tomorrow, with an anticipated worldwide television audience of 750 million.

Now the shock has worn off, Jelavic is embracing the magnitude of the task. ‘It’s the kind of game you dream about,’ he says. ‘Brazil are my favourites for the tournament but we have quality players too. We can qualify, we have nothing to lose.’

No fear: Nikica Jelavic insists Croatia are unnerved at facing Brazil in the World Cup opener

On the move: The Croatia striker joined Hull from Everton to get in shape for the tournament

Like most Croatians, Jelavic — who joined Hull City from  Everton in January to get match-sharp for the World Cup — doesn’t do inferiority complex.

As a relatively young nation, wearing the shirt with pride is more than a cliche for Croatia, as England will remember from their 3-2 win at Wembley in 2007 that spelled the  end for Steve McClaren.

‘I don’t know what it’s like in England, but in Croatia we play with our heart. We go out feeling on top of the world, no matter how small we are as a country,’ explains Jelavic.

‘On the pitch, it is 11 against 11 and we believe the Croatian first XI can play against any team.

‘Look at the clubs some of the players are with. Luka Modric is a top player with Real Madrid. Mario Mandzukic is the centre forward with Bayern Munich. Our captain Darijo Srna has more than a hundred caps, he could go to any team in the world. We have plenty of good players and lots of young talents.’

The stand-out name to English fans is Modric. He graced Spurs for four years before moving to Madrid where he has proved himself worthy of galactico status after winning the Champions League.

‘Modric is one of the best in the world,’ insists Jelavic. ‘I wouldn’t like to say if he’d get in the Brazil team, he is Croatian so it doesn’t matter — he will play for us! He is definitely at the top level.

‘As a striker, it’s very easy to play with him. He can see  everything, so all you need to do is find the space to run into. Do the movement and he will get you the ball.’

A couple of other familiar names should also be on show. Former Arsenal striker Eduardo is in the squad to face Brazil, the country where he was born. So is ex-Tottenham defender Vedran Corluka.

After the laid-back years of Slaven Bilic, hardman Niko Kovac is in charge. ‘He was my first captain in the Croatia team — a great leader. And he’s the same as manager,’ says Jelavic.

Having played in Britain for four years with Rangers in Glasgow, Everton and Hull, 28-year-old Jelavic will also keep a close eye on England’s prospects. Interestingly, as a player who has worked in five different countries, he thinks England’s chances are fatally wounded before a ball has been kicked because of fatigue.

He says: ‘There are always big expectations on England. They have very good players but the season is too long, too many games.

‘Everywhere in Europe you have a break in the winter. In England we played eight games in a month from the start of December, it really is too many and means the players aren’t fresh for a Euro or a World Cup.

‘That is the reason England can’t win big competitions despite all these talented  players and a massive army of supporters. I can’t remember the last time they reached the semi-finals (Euro 96). It is a long time ago.

‘England is a big football country. But you can’t say you are favourites — there are always a few teams before England.’

Rising star: Nikica Jelavic has tipped former Everton teammate Ross Barkley (C) to star in Brazil

On a more positive note, Jelavic expects his former Everton team-mate Ross Barkley to prove he’s ready for the World Cup at the age of 20 — provided he is given a licence to thrill by Roy Hodgson.

I am not surprised he is going to the World Cup,’ said Jelavic. ‘When I signed for Everton, I watched him train at first, then he got more chances and his  progression was really quick and he is showing what he can do.

‘He is one of the biggest talents I have played with.

‘He is unbelievably fast with the ball, even faster with the ball than without the ball!

‘Why can’t he do that at the World Cup? Just let him play like he does for his club. Don’t speak to him too much.’
