A lamb wearing a festive red-and-green sweater who was found wandering around Omaha, Nebraska, has been reunited with his owner.

Margaret Vazquez tells KMTV she initially panicked when her house-trained farm pet named Gage went missing. 

She says the six-month-old sheep follows her 'everywhere . . . jumps on the bed and sleeps on the couch.'

Quizzed about his unusual attire, she added: 'I just think he looks cute in it, he's just like my boy. I want to dress him up.'

Nebraska Humane Society spokeswoman Pam Wiese says the sheep was reclaimed Tuesday evening. 

The rescue shelter was caring for Gage after he was spotted trotting around a Omaha neighborhood.

He had escaped from his front yard and wandered several blocks away.

Gage shares a shed with two chickens, when he isn't indoors.

The four-legged pet is used to walking on a leash and doesn't seem to mind that the holiday apparel he dons appears to have been designed for a dog.

Vazquez says it was the first time Gage has escaped and he will now spend more time indoors. 

She learned about his whereabouts from Facebook because of publicity surrounding the animal.

On visiting the Humane Society Vazquez had to show photos of Gage to prove he was her pet.

The organization had planned to put him up for adoption if no one came forward.
