A University professor jumped to his death from a campus parking garage after he was lured into sharing sexually explicit pictures with an underage girl online and then blackmailed by one of her relatives who orchestrated the elaborate scam, police said.

A 37-year-old man, from Louisiana, is due to be arraigned in federal court today on a charge of using a phone and the Internet to extort money from Texas A&M University professor James Arnt Aune, 59.

Aune, a married father-of-two who was also chair of the school's Department of Communications, committed suicide on the morning of January 8.

Shortly before, he sent his alleged blackmailer a text message stating 'Killing myself now. And u will be prosecuted for blackmail' just one minute before he died.

According to an FBI affidavit, text and email conversations found on Aune's campus computer and iPhone showed the suspect had been threatening to call police and Aune's employers if he did not send him 'something like $5,000.'

Aune transferred the alleged blackmailer $1,000 initially and promised to send more money in January, FBI investigators said in the document.

According to Chron.com, the girl, who hasn't been named, told police the man took nude photos and videos of her and she and the man created a site on MocoSpace.com.

Using a fake name and the email address pretty-gurl985@yahoo.com, the alleged blackmailer targeted men, got their phone numbers and sent them the sexually explicit photos and videos. He kept a list of the names and numbers of men they were setting out to extort.

Under the plan, the suspect, who was charged in 2011 with aggravated incest and oral sexual battery for allegedly abusing the same female relative, would then call the men targeted by the scam, pretending to be an outraged father, and demand payment to cover the cost of counseling for his daughter.

In a series of text messages exchanged with Aune, he also claimed his daughter was transgender so especially vulnerable.

'It is very hard to help a teenage trans-gender child be accepted in life; to help her find a life worth living,' one of text messages the suspect allegedly sent to Aune said, according to Chron.com.

'And you came in with your disgusting (talking).'

Over time, the texts from the alleged blackmailer to Aune became increasingly threatening.

'If I do not hear from you I swear to Gold Almighty that the police in your place of employment, students ALL OVER THE INTERNET ... ALL OF THEM will be able to see your conversations, text , pictures you sent,' stated one message.

'And if by some miracle you get away with this I will use every chance I get to make sure every place or person associated with you knows and see what you have done. Last chance, you better make the right move.'

The professor told his wife in mid December that he was being blackmailed after being caught up in an online sexual relationship with a minor, according to the FBI affidavit.

On the morning of Aune's death, the suspected blackmailer contacted him at 9:21 a.m., giving him three hours to come up with the unknown sum of money or 'the calls start.'

At 10:29 a.m. Aune replied: 'Killing myself now. And u will be prosecuted for blackmail.'

A minute later, he jumped off the parking garage to his death, according to the FBI affidavit.

The 37-year-old suspect was indicted last week.
