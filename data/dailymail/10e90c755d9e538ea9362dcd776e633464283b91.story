An unsuspecting pig has become an internet sensation - after its owner realised the creases in her wrinkly forehead looked just like Yoda.

Bizarrely, the folds in the hogs head resemble that of iconic Star Wars character, and the swine has proved an instant hit with fans of the films.

The resemblance to Jedi master was first noticed by a relative of the pet's owner, Luis Bojorquez, 34, from Tijuana, Mexico.

The resemblance is strong in this one: The pig's folds and ears have combined to look just like Yoda

Uncanny: The Star Wars Jedi master looks very similar to the folds on Ramona Flowers' head

Two year old pot belly pig, 'Ramona Flowers', takes regular strolls around her neighbourhood and enjoys showing off her unique forehead to local residents.

Proud owner Luis said: 'It was my wife's cousin that first noticed her head after she took a few pictures of Ramona.

'It looks just like Yoda's face and I was really surprised that I had never noticed it before.

'I'm not so sure she would like the 
comparison as we've always thought of her as a spoilt princess and if 
she found out it might make her have one of her infamous temper 
tantrums.

'We called her 
Ramona Flowers because she reminds us of the character from the Scott 
Pilgrim graphic novels and has a feisty but fun nature, just like in the
 comics.

'She attracts a lot
 of attention from neighbours and as she roams around freely and she is 
often brought back home by the local kid in the area.'
