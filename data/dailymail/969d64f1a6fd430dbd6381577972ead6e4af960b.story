Wendy Davis, the overnight Democratic Party success story whose hardscrabble roots and Texas-sized abortion rights filibuster made her a household name in June 2013, is in a sudden downward spiral.

A day after the Dallas Morning News published a profile of the 50-year-old state senator and gubernatorial candidate that found problems with her public biography, Davis began lashing out at her Republican opponent, state Attorney General Gregg Abbott, complaining that he had never 'walked a day in my shoes.'

Abbott is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair from the age of 26 after a tree fell on him during a long-distance jog.

In her defense, Annie's List, a progressive group that promotes female Democratic candidates, blasted the handicapped Abbott for 'running scared.'

And Davis herself tweeted on Tuesday that 'the only thing Abbott & his allies have proven with these desperate attacks is that they don’t understand these Texas stories of struggle.'

Democratic candidate for Texas governor Wendy Davis is struggling to explain misstatements in her own biography, and resorted to attacking her opponent, a paraplegic, for never having 'walked a day in my shoes'

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, Republican candidate for Texas Governor, lost the use of his legs at age 26 in a freak accident, when an oak tree fell on his back as he jogged by

'We’re not surprised by Greg Abbott’s campaign attacks on the personal story of my life as a single mother who worked hard to get ahead,'  Davis said in a statement after the Dallas newspaper published its exploration of her life story.

'I am proud of where I came from,' she said, 'and I am proud of what I’ve been able to achieve through hard work and perseverance. And I guarantee you that anyone who tries to say otherwise hasn’t walked a day in my shoes.'

Wayne Slater, the reporter who started the news cycle with a deep-dive into Davis' life story, insists that he never spoke to Abbott or his campaign staff for his story.

Slater is regarded as a liberal partisan, and wrote an unflattering 2003 book-length critique of then-President George W. Bush and his deputy chief of staff Karl Rove.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry is no stranger to public gaffes. He will vacate the governor's mansion after the 2014 election. Perry surprised abortion-rights defenders when he trumped Davis' filibuster by extending the state's legislative calendar long enough to pass the bill she opposed

Davis, who rocketed to stardom in pink sneakers that sustained her through an 11-hour filibuster aimed at killing new restrictions on abortion clinics, isn't backing down from new punchlines that Slater has provided her GOP rivals.

While she has styled herself as a self-made single mother who put herself through Harvard Law School, Slater found that her older husband Jeff paid most of the bills, including footing her last two years at Texas Christian University and then her law school tuition.

He cashed in his 401(k) retirement account and borrowed still more money to cover his wife's educational bills.

Ultimately their marriage soured, and conservative pundits are finding the timing noteworthy since Jeff Davis recalled that his ex-wife left him right after he made the final payment on her student loans.

'It was ironic, he told the Dallas Morning News. 'I made the last payment, and it was the next day she left.'

Slater also found fault with the life timeline Wendy Davis has promoted for herself, learning that she became a single mother later in life than she has claimed and didn't struggle financially while she completed her education.

She was 21 – not 19 as her online Texas Senate biography claims – when she divorced her first husband. She lived in a mobile home with her daughter Amber, but only for a few months, it turns out.

And life became much easier when she married again just a few years later. Jeff's income as a lawyer helped with expenses raising Amber and Dru, another daughter the couple had together.

He ended up with custody of both daughters, casting more doubt on Wendy Davis' narrative as a professional woman who successfully raised two children.

She has made these questions fair game herself, Slater wrote, because she 'has made her personal story of struggle and success a centerpiece of her campaign' for governor.

And 'some facts have been blurred.'

The shoes: Davis' pink running sneakers made her an overnight feminist icon after she stood for 11 hours straight in opposition to a bill -- which eventually became law -- tightening requirements for abortion providers

Davis acknowledged to the Dallas newspaper that her 'language should be tighter' when telling her life story. She admitted that she was now 'learning about' the dangers of 'using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail.'

Although Abbott's campaign didn't contribute to Slater's story, it came out swinging after it hit newsstands.

Matt Hirsch, the Abbott campaign's communications director, said in a statement that Davis is 'trying to hide her past.'

'Sen. Wendy Davis systematically, intentionally and repeatedly deceived Texans for years about her background, yet she expects voters to indulge her fanciful narrative,' Hirsch claimed. 'If voters can't trust what Sen. Davis says, how can they trust her to lead?'

The conservative punditry website HotAir.com snarked that 'a guy who’s spent nearly 30 years in a wheelchair can relate to struggle, but it’s telling that Team Victim still thinks they can win a "my life sucked even harder than yours" debate with someone like him.'

'Sure, he was crippled and needed spinal surgery and extensive rehabilitation and overcame it all to become attorney general of Texas, but what hardship is that compared to a woman overcoming young motherhood to attend Harvard Law?'

Wendy's army: Opponents of the right-to-life movement have stood behind Davis, putting millions into her coffers in hope of making her governor

Abbott, the Republican nominee for governor, hasn't spoken publicly about the 'walk a day in my shoes' slight, but the Dallas Morning News profile's author insists his story wasn't a politically generated hit piece

Davis faces an uphill climb in her unlikely battle to become the first Democratic statewide office-holder in Texas since Ann Richards lost the governor's mansion to George W. Bush in 1994.

Her campaign collected $12.2 million last year and had $9.5 million banked as of last week. But Abbott has a war chest of $27 million amassed for the battle.

Davis has fired back, using the episode as a chance to build her email list and raise still more money.

'Mine is a story about a teenage single mother who struggled to keep her young family afloat,' she wrote online Tuesday.

'It’s a story about a young woman who was given a precious opportunity to work her way up in the world. It’s a story about resiliency, and sacrifice, and perseverance.'

'And you’re damn right it’s a true story.'
