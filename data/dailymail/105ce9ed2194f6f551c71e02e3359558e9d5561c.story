The Swedish driver's licence examiner has come under fire after asking students if it is 'a mitigating circumstance' if a woman is drunk during sexual assault.

Learner drivers undergoing a compulsory theory course on drink-driving have been invited to discuss several rape scenarios where alcohol is involved.

The organisation behind the material has defended the use of questions involving rape, saying it is intended to inspire discussion about using alcohol 'as an excuse when you do something stupid'.

The theory booklet is used across Sweden for compulsory risk-assessment courses as part of the drivers licence theory exam, which mostly undertaken by 16 to 18-year-olds.

Learner drivers are asked to discuss several scenarios where alcohol and drugs are involved, including two about rape with no relation to traffic or driving.

The book asks: 'An intoxicated woman is raped by a man. When he is punished, is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated?'

It also described a similar rape-scenario where the male perpetrator is 'intoxicated' and whether that would be 'an aggravating or mitigating circumstance' in court.

Linnea Risinger, 32, from Falun, Dalarna, spotted the questions during her course, and posted a picture of it on her Facebook.

The two questions read: 'An intoxicated woman is raped by a man. When he is punished is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated?,' and similarly 'An intoxicated man rapes a woman'

The picture caused heated reactions, with many asking what the rape scenarios had to do with getting a driver's licence.

Ms Risinger said she had been surprised to see the questions, especially as there could be victims of sexual assault forced to take part in discussions about rape in a context where they could not be expected to be prepared for them.

'Rape has nothing to do with a driver's licence,' Ms Risinger, a spokesperson for the local Green Party, told Aftonbladet.

'It is not okay that you should be forced to discuss during a compulsory course to get your licence.

'It is highly likely that there are boys and girls who take part in this course who are victims. They are there to get a driver's licence, not go to therapy.' 

However, The Swedish National Organisation for Driving Schools (Sveriges trafikskolors riksförbund) defends the use of the rape scenarios, saying it shines a light on the fact that alcohol is often used as an excuse when 'doing something stupid'.

'We want a discussion about taking responsibility for your actions, and that is the reason the questions are in there,' a representative told newspaper ETC.
