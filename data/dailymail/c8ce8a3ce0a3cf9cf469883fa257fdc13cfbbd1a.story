Kylie's Can't Get You Out Of My Head has been voted the catchiest song of all time

They are the songs that inspire a love-hate relationship - the ones we love to listen to but then remain stuck in our heads for hours.

And yesterday it emerged Kylie Minogue’s aptly-titled Can’t Get You Out Of My Head has acquired the title of catchiest song of all time in a poll which saw a string of celebrities nominate their favourites.

Actress and model Lily Cole, TV presenter Carol Vorderman, broadcaster Janet Street Porter and Science Minister David Willetts were among those who nominated tunes they still found themselves humming along to hours after listening to them.

Scientists hope the findings will help
 future research into Alzheimer’s disease, allowing them to use the 
catchiest musical fragments to trigger memories.

The poll of 700 people was designed to 
launch the largest ever experiment into what makes music memorable 
organised by Manchester Science Festival.

Miss Minogue’s track was followed closely in second place by Robin Thicke’s Blurred lines and Daft Punks summer hit Get Lucky.

In fourth place came Abba’s SOS, followed by The Birdie Song by the Tweets and the Soprano’s theme tune Woke Up This Morning by Alabama 3 which was nominated in sixth place.

Aerosmith’s Love Me Two Times also made the top ten with Abba hitting another place in the chart with Dancing Queen.

Speaking at the event computational musicologist John Ashley Burgoyne, who is working on the project, said: ‘Understanding catchy music is about 
much more than just a recipe for next week’s number one hit: It’s the 
key to understanding why musical memories last a lifetime.

‘Catchy music sticks in your head and lingers there. 

'When you hear catchy music again years 
or even decades later, all of a sudden the song comes back to and you 
find yourself singing along in your head.’ 

Aerosmith's Love Me Two Times was listed as one of the catchiest songs of all time

Professor Alistair Burns, from the 
University of Manchester's institute of brain behaviour and mental 
health, believes the project could be revolutionary in helping suffers 
of dementia preserve and rebuild their memories.

The
 Alzheimer Society already runs Singing For The Brain and Professor Burns 
believes the project could build on helping charities and doctors working 
with patients.

He said: 
'Many dementia support groups use music singing and personalised 
playlists to help those with failing memory. The results could certainly have implications for improving the quality of life for people with dementia.'
