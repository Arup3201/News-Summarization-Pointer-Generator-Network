A high-speed chase that began in Miami-Dade County this morning following a double homicide ended in a violent crash and standoff in southwestern Broward County that left two others dead.

The incident unfolded Wednesday morning in rural Broward County when officers went in pursuit of a man identified as Antonio Feliu suspected of gunning down a woman and her daughter.

Miami television stations broadcast the chase, which started some time before 10am. The speeding SUV t-boned another vehicle, ejecting a female passenger, who died at the scene.

Shots rang out as authorities approached Feliu's vehicle and officials took cover as they assisted the dying victim on the ground in the grassy median, CBS News reported.

Four SWAT vehicles surrounded the SUV and eventually officers found Feliu dead inside from what was described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  

The incident began unfolding at around 9.45am when officers responded to a report of shots fired during a domestic dispute at Southwest 189th Street and 123rd Avenue in Miami.

Vivian Martinez, 51, was pronounced dead on the scene, according to NBC News. Her 28-year-old, daughter, Anabel Benitez, was airlifted to Kendall Regional Hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.

Heavy machinery: Three armored vehicles carrying four SWAT teams in full tactical gear arrived on the scene and secured the SUV

Feliu reportedly fled in a black Mercedes-Benz Crossover, heading north on U.S. 27. He drove about 40 miles, at times doing over 100mph, before he slammed into a Mercedes sedan.

Both vehicles spun out of control, with the impact ejecting the female driver from the black sedan onto the median. She later died from her injuries.

The suspect's smashed-up SUV came to rest in a grassy field, where it was approached by several police officers with their weapons drawn.

A chopper video of the incident showed the law enforcement agents running for cover after gunfire erupted inside the SUV.

Tense moments: After an hour-long standoff, officers opened the driver's side and found the man dead inside from a self-inflicted wound

Bloody morning: The Miami shooting followed by the dramatic chase left three women dead

Four SWAT teams arrived on the scene in armored vehicles and surrounded the badly damaged Mercedes. At around 11am following an hour-long standoff, the officers opened the driver's side and found Feliu dead inside.

Police have yet to determine the nature of the relationship between the shooting suspect and the mother and daughter gunned down in Miami.
