An illegal shisha cafe has been demolished after neighbours complained about smell of tobacco and the sound of smokers chatting into the early hours of the morning.

A wooden extension accommodating up to 40 smokers had been illegally added to the back of Yasmin Restaurant and Shisha Bar on High Road in Wealdstone, North London.

But the structure was removed by Harrow Council this morning as it had been built without planning permission and the cafe owners had apparently ignored requests to remove it.

Neighbours had complained to the council about the noise and
 smell of tobacco wafting into their homes from the Turkish cafe, which was open 
to the small hours of the morning.

Harrow Council said it had given the owners notice to remove the extension but no action had been taken.Today council workers arrived to pull down the structure. 

They removed 30 shisha pipes and bags of sweet-smelling tobacco, before taking down the walls and paring the building back to its legally allowed limits.

In a day of action elsewhere, planning 
enforcement notices were enforced against unlicensed temporary cabins 
and a plumber’s office built at the rear of a property.

Reaction: Harrow Council said the demolition was in response to complaints from the cafe's neighbours, who it said had become 'fed up' with the illegal structure causing 'extra noise and disturbance'

'We have got to send a signal to people who think that planning rules are some kind of minor inconvenience that disappear if you ignore them for long enough,' said Harrow Council leader Susan Hall.

'That isn’t fair on the silent 
hard-working majority who abide by the law... As leader of the council 
they expect me to be tough on law breakers and I will do exactly that,' 
the Councillor added.

Harrow
 Council said the demolition was in response to complaints from the 
cafe's neighbours, who it said had become 'fed up' with the illegal 
structure causing 'extra noise and disturbance'.

Describing the need to take action against illegal structures, Councillor Hall said 'ordinary Harrow residents' are looking to Harrow Council to take a lead on the 'upsurge we are witnessing of beds in sheds - or in this case fags in sheds'.

The cafe in Wealdstone, North London was demolished because it had broken council rules on planning applications - not because it dealt in shisha.

However, many premises fall foul of the law as a result of legislation that came into force on July 1, 2007 which made it illegal to smoke in all enclosed work places in England.

Although a loophole meant the ban did not initially apply to shisha premises, this has now been closed and they are no longer exempt from the smoke free legislation.

As shisha smoking is generally a communal pastime that can last for several hours, many cafes in the UK have created elaborate shelters with heating equipment and furniture designed to replicate the inside of a building.

Providing at least 50 per cent of the structure is open to the air, these shelters are perfectly legal to smoke in, with additional licenses required to serve food, drink and provide entertainment.

Shisha is a legal tobacco-like substance that is mixed with sugar or molasses, so the smoke has a sweet smell and taste.

Contrary
 to the belief of many users, shisha is considered more harmful
 than cigarettes because the liquid in the pipes does not act as
 a filter for the harmful toxins.
