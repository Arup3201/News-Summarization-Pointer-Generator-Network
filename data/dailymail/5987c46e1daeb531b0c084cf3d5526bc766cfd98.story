Valentine's Day is billed as the most
 romantic of the year. And for most couples, it means pulling out all 
the stops to show their partners just how much they care.

However,
 one girlfriend used the special day to break up with her boyfriend - 
with a cold-hearted message on a petrol station's advertising board.

'Laura'
 paid to display the message at an Esso garage in Manchester because she
 knew her boyfriend went there every day for his lunch so he would see it.

Cruel: The break-up message was posted on an ad space at an Esso garage in Manchester by 'Laura'

Not only did she announce that she was breaking up with her partner, she also informed him that she was leaving him for another man.

The cowardly message reads: 'I’m leaving you for Gary. Your clothes are at your mum’s. I’ve change the locks.

'Sorry to do this on Valentine’s Day. Laura.'

The ad, which has become a social media hit, was spotted by Jordan Wilson who posted it on Twitter with the caption: 'This has to be the meanest dump ever.

'Not such a great Valentine’s day for the man in question here.

'To get dumped is bad enough, but the humiliation of seeing it displayed at your local petrol station is just one step too far.'

Eagle eye: Twitter user Jordan Wilson spotted the break-up message and posted it on the social media site with it quickly becoming an online hit

The Amscreen board, upon which the cruel message was displayed, usually advertises snack deals.

But could this Valentine's break-up just be an elaborate hoax?

It transpires that Amscreen is a 
company that specialises in selling advertising space on digital signage
 screens and is run by none other than entrepreneur Lord Alan Sugar and 
his son Simon.

That's clever! Simon Sugar, who runs the company, and his father Sir Alan Sugar, who is chairman, both tweeted about the message

Lord Sugar tweeted a snap of the 
ad out to his 2.7m followers with the caption: 'Have a look at the 
advert someone took out on one of our screens today… Poor bloke!  
#Valentines #Amscreen'

His son Simon then added: 'The world's media seemed to have loved Laura's ad. You can rent out a screen via...'

Mr Wilson, who first posted the photo spurring the internet frenzy, is a digital account manager at PushON.

Spreading the word: The Sugar men tweeted about the break-up message, which has gone viral and even reached press in the US and Australia

After posting the photo, Wilson added: 'It seems the #amscreen pic has reached Australia judging by the recent RT's...'

And it appears that the break-up message didn't set 'Laura' back too much - the ad space can be hired out for £100 a month.
