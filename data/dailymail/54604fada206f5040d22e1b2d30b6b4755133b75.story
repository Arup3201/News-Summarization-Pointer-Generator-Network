Until now, it has been the preserve of those willing to hunt for their supper – or at least hunt out restaurants serving it.

Now, however, grouse has come to the high street.

Marks & Spencer has become the first retailer to stock whole wild red grouse – and bosses are expecting the £10 oven-ready dish to fly off the shelves.

Bright purple heather in the Yorkshire dales as a dog retrieves a grouse on the Glorious 12th (of August), the traditional start of the Grouse shooting season

Elite tradition: The Queen regularly attends the shoot at this time of year on her Balmoral estate in Scotland and younger royals are also enthusiasts

Taking aim: Shooting grouse is viewed as being at the centre of an industry vital to the rural economy

The birds, which have a distinctive 
rich flavour, are shot on the moors in Yorkshire and Northumberland and 
transported to stores in time for the following morning.

M&S, which hopes to tap into a 
growing desire for naturally reared, traditional food, is offering the 
dish as part of a new range of British game.

Rabbit, wood pigeon, venison, pheasant and partridge will also be available from October, when they are at their seasonal best.

August 12, known as the Glorious Twelfth, signals the start of the grouse shooting season, which continues until December.

Gamekeepers and country estates are hopeful that the warm summer weather will make this year's grouse season one of the best for many years

Regarded as the king of game birds, grouse has a distinctive flavour derived from the heather moorland they live on. It is also lean and virtually fat free meat, which makes it a healthier alternative to other meats

The Moorland Associations estimates the £67million English industry helps employ around 1,500 people

The industry has its critics, including the League Against Cruel Sports, which complains of cruelty to the birds, which might be injured rather than killed outright

The Queen regularly attends the shoot 
at this time of year on her Balmoral estate in Scotland, while the 
younger royals are also enthusiasts of the sport.

'Our customers are telling us they are keen to try more game as an alternative to traditional everyday meats'

Regarded as the king of game birds, 
grouse has a distinctive  flavour derived from the heather moorland it 
lives on. It is also lean and virtually fat-free meat.

Tom Harvey from M&S said: ‘Our 
customers are telling us they are keen to try more game as an 
alternative to traditional  everyday meats.’

Grouse will initially be available 
only from the chain’s flagship London stores at Kensington High Street 
and Marble Arch. If it proves popular, however, it could be sold at 
other branches in future.
