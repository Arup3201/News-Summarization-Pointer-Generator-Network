Cristiano Ronaldo watched from the bench as Real Madrid lost to Roma in their latest pre-season friendly on Tuesday night.

Francesco Totti's strike after the break proved to be the difference in Texas as Carlo Ancelotti's side struggled without their talisman, even though they had world-record signing Gareth Bale on the pitch.

The match was interrupted towards the end by a pitch invasion as fans tried to meet their heroes and take 'selfies' with them.

Roma: Skorupski, Florenzi, Benatia, Castan, Cole; Nainggolan, Keita, Pjanic (De Rossi 65), Iturbe, Totti (Borriello 71), Ljajic.

Goal: Totti 58

Real Madrid: Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Coentrao, Illarra, Alonso (Medran 65), Modric (Mascarell 73), Bale (Sobrinho 73), Isco, Lucas.

Approximately 20 fans, mostly young men, appeared to overwhelm the security officials before they were rounded up and removed from the pitch.

Madrid enjoyed the bulk of the possession at the Cotton Bowl but could not find a way past the stubborn Italian defence.

The winner arrived just before the hour mark when Totti allowed the ball to run for Alessandro Florenzi before sweeping home the return ball.

Roma nearly doubled their advantage a minute later, but Adem Ljajic failed to convert.

Bale started for the Spanish giants but struggled to make an impact as Ancelotti awaits the return of World Cup stars James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema.

He had one of Madrid's best chances 
midway through the first half when he scuffed his shot wide from close 
range. Just before the break, Pepe blazed an effort over the bar as the 
Champions League winners pressed.

Ashley
 Cole, meanwhile, lined up for Roma and believed he had reason to 
complain early in the second half when he alleged Raul de Tomas had 
stamped on him.

Roma now face Inter Milan on Saturday while Real Madrid tackle Manchester United.
