Shawnda Rush suddenly awoke one morning in April 2005 with no memory of the 30 years she had lived.

The woman, who has MS, suffered a traumatic bout of amnesia and though she remembered her own identity she was at a loss at who the child and man were in her Virginia home, she told the Washington Post.

She is now speaking out about the ordeal that tore apart her marriage and how she has had to rely on reading her personal journals, watching TV and perusing Facebook to learn how to talk and interact with others as an adult.

Pressing on: Shawnda Rush, right, with her daughter, Shaylin, are now moving forward after the traumatic memory loss in April 2005

The Virginia woman looked at her toddler 
daughter and husband in April 2005 with absolutely no hints of who they 
were or how she knew them. 

She did not immediately realize what was going on and it took her a few days to divulge to her own mother, Marsha Rush, what was happening.

Her daughter Shaylin was just a 
19-month-old when her mother's amnesia struck. Though she was too young 
to realize what was going on, Shaylin has grown up often hearing her 
mother say, 'I don't remember' - a phrase the little girl has come to 
mimic.

The child did learn of her mother's shocking memory loss when she was nearly 4-years-old.

Sudden loss: Shawnda Rush says she has relied on watching TV, reading through her old journals and using Facebook to relearn how to interact as an adult

Rush says she watched soap operas and talk shows, in particular 'George Lopez,' to re-learn how to talk.

'I also want people to understand that's how I've had to learn. I don't 
know any life any other way, because I lost my memory. People had the 
opportunity to come out of the womb and go through school and learn 
friendships and stuff. I lost all that,' she told the Post in 2012.

She also used her daughter's math homework to learn basic fundamentals 
and had to be taught again how to use a cell phone and manage her check 
book.

An avid journal writer in her past life, Rush was able to read about her
 past lives and her experiences beforehand based on those diaries.

She went to physical therapy to gain her strength and also underwent speech therapy to develop her vocabulary.

'Just like I didn’t know how to pump gas, I didn't know how to use a 
debit card, I couldn’t do any of that stuff. So I had to learn,' she said.

Through the ordeal, it became increasingly apparent that her marriage was in trouble and ultimately she and her husband of three years decided to divorce. 

Ordeal: Shawnda Rush, 38, of Winchester, VA suffers from memory loss after being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on July 4, 2004

The science behind her condition is still a mystery.

She had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in July 2004 after she 
began experiencing symptoms of the neurological disorder like vision 
loss and numbness. Then began the onset of cognitive problems like forgetfulness, confusion,
 feelings of helplessness and loss of vocabulary.

She began taking more than 10 medications and her body became weak and she could no longer continue her normal routine.

Neurologist Avindra Nath, who treated Shawnda at Johns Hopkins Hospital 
in Baltimore, said that amnesia is a rare occurrence in multiple 
sclerosis patients.

Other doctors told the Post that her sudden memory loss could have been 
caused by the combination of the drugs she was prescribed but Dr Nath 
doubted the medication could have had that kind of impact.

Doctors still are not sure what altered her memory to such a degree.
