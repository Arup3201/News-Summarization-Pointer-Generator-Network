The Church of England’s decision to reject women bishops has crippled its chances of resisting government plans for gay marriage, a senior MP said last night.

Sir Tony Baldry, the Tory MP and Church Commissioner, said church members would be ‘deluding themselves’ if they thought their views on ‘moral issues such as same-sex marriage’ would be given the same weight as before.

The Church of England’s General Synod voted this week to reject plans for women bishops despite overwhelming support in parishes and the country as a whole.

Vote: Church members would be 'deluding themselves' if they thought their views on issues like gay marriage would carry the same weight as before, an MP said

Sir Tony’s intervention in the Commons came as former Cabinet minister, Lord Tebbit warned that David Cameron’s decision to  fast-track a vote on gay marriage would drive more Tory voters into the arms of Ukip.

The Prime Minister’s support for same-sex civil marriage was ‘totally, absolutely and completely misconceived’, he added.

There is a growing Tory backlash against plans, revealed by the Mail yesterday, to bring forward to January a vote on the law change.

Dozens of Tory MPs are expected to vote against, but the legislation is almost certain to get through thanks to Labour and Lib Dem support.

Lord Tebbit said the proposal would push Conservative voters to Ukip, which received its highest-ever vote in the Corby by-election last week. ‘I will oppose it in every possible way I can,’ he added.

‘This is a guaranteed vote-loser.’

Civil partnerships, introduced in 2005, give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples.

But ministers want them to be legally allowed to make marriage vows.

Owen Paterson, the Conservative Environment Secretary, has indicated he will vote against.

David Burrowes, Tory MP for Enfield Southgate, said: ‘It is highly premature.’

He added that it was a mistake to ‘rush into legislation’ when ministers should be focusing on getting the economy moving.
