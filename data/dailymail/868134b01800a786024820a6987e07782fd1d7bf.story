These shocking pictures show a house littered with dirty nappies, soiled bedding and buckets of urine where two young children were being forced to live.

The parents of the three-year-old and six-year-old were found guilty of neglect after they were found living in the dirty home among piles of rubbish and rotting food.

The squalor, at the house in Birkenhead, Wirral, was described as 'filthy' and 'appalling' by a judge who said the dirty conditions had clearly been building up over a period of months.

Two children were living in squalid conditions in a house littered with dirty nappies and buckets of urine 

Piles of rubbish littered the floors, while dirty pillows and bed linen were found throughout the property. 

In some rooms police found buckets of urine and dirty nappies, as well as what appeared to be faeces on the floor. 

Discarded and rotting food was found in the kitchen where dirty plates and cooking utensils were found piled high. 

The children have been taken away from their parents, who cannot be named, and are now being looked after by social services. 

The alcoholic parents of the children were sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for 18 months 

Piles of dirty plates and kitchen items were found in the kitchen, as well as dozens of piles of rotting food 

In the bedrooms mattresses, pillows and bedding were soiled and dirty, with rubbish strewn across the floor 

Judge Dennis Watson, QC, told Liverpool Crown Court: 'This was not something that occurred overnight.

'This was something that developed and became the norm over a period of some months.'

The court heard the neglect occurred after a number of relatives of the children's relatives died. Her partner is disabled. Both were referred to as alcoholics.

The pair were given prison sentences of four months, suspended for 18 months. Both must complete supervision programmes. 

Andrew McInnes, defending the father, said: 'He accepts by his plea of guilty that the photos are difficult. The thing for him is to get more contact with the children and that is a matter for social services.'

Toys, rubbish and clothing were found discarded about the room and next to a broken and torn sofa 

Buckets of urine were found throughout the house, alongside rubbish where the children had been living

Piles of rubbish were found collected in corners of the house, with discarded packets spilling out of them 

The children were taken into the care of social services and their father wants to get more contact with them 

Staircases were shown littered with discarded items and rubbish throughout the home when police searched

Pillows found in the Merseyside home were filthy and stained, following months of neglect of the home
