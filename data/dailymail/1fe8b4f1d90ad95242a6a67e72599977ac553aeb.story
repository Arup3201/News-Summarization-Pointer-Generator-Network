An Orlando judge has ruled that a man who said he wanted get a 10-year-old girl pregnant must remain jailed.

Dwipin Thomas Maliackal, 24, was arrested after he told an undercover FBI officer posing as the father of two girls, aged 10 and 13, that he wanted to have sex with them and impregnate one.

Agents swooped on Maliackal after he traveled from his home in Seminole, Florida to the Orlando area to meet the man and his daughters.

He had met the undercover agent on an incest chat room on December 7 where Maliackal, who graduated from University of South Florida this summer, used the name 'Horny_Indian'.

'Sick': Dwipin Maliackal, 24, was arrested after telling an undercover FBI agent that he wanted to have sex with his daughters. Maliackal just graduated from college, where he was president of his fraternity, right

As reported by the Orlando Sentinel, Maliackal's parents recently testified in court that their son could live with them if he was released from jail.

Yet Judge Karla Spaulding firmly rejected the request, noting there are girls who live near the family home.

'The presence of minor female children in such close proximity to the Maliackal's residence provides the opportunity for the Defendant to attempt to act on his interest in molesting minor females if released,' the judge wrote in her recent order.

'Despite his family's best intentions, they cannot realistically supervise the Defendant every minute of every day,' she added. Spaulding ordered that Maliackal remains jailed pending further proceedings.

Maliackal told the undercover agent that he had had sex with other children, including relatives and a neighbor, and that his youngest victim had been just five years old, according to the criminal complaint.

He added that he wanted to have sex with the agent's 10-year-old daughter and make her his 'girlfriend', and that he hoped sex with the girls would be a 'regular thing', the complaint said.

'I would love to get her pregnant, if you're OK with that,' Maliackal told the agent.

Aspirations: Maliackal had hoped to become a sports broadcaster. He is seen here in a university video

Dark past: He allegedly told agents he had had sex with children as young as five and with relatives and a neighbour. He said had been sexually attracted to 'prepubescent' girls since he was a teenager

The complaint noted other sex acts Maliackal said he wanted to perform on the young girls, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

On December 19, he asked the agent if he could visit the family in Orlando and spend the weekend with the girls, and they agreed to meet at a restaurant in Maitland.

Before the meeting, Maliackal emailed the agent saying: 'Not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous meeting you and 
even more nervous about meeting your daughters lol [laugh out loud].'

Maliackal arrived at the meeting place on December 20 and was arrested when he approached the undercover agent.

He told agents he had planned to have sex with both of the girls and said has been sexually attracted to 'prepubescent' girls since he was a teenager.

He said the last time he had done 'this type of thing' was around four years ago, the complaint said.

He is charged with lewd and lascivious 
battery on a person under the age of 18. He is now behind bars in the 
Seminole County Jail.

Maliackal, who was raised in St Petersburg, graduated from the University of South Florida with a degree in mass communications.

According to his Facebook page and a blog in his name, he is an  aspiring sportscaster and president of his fraternity at USF. His Facebook and Twitter accounts have now been removed.
