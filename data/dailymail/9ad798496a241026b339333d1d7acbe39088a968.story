It has long been debated how cats went from running in the wild to becoming our domesticated furry friends.

Researchers may have solved the mystery after analysing the genetic makeup of Egyptian cat mummies.

The results of the study of DNA from the remains of ritually slaughtered animals found in tombs suggest that we have the people of Ancient Egypt to thank for our moggies and ginger toms.

Scientists at the University of California Davis published the study which points at the Egyptians as being the first cat breeders, The Sunday Times reports.

In a paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, the team claim that in order to keep up with the demand of cats as sacrifices to the gods, the Egyptians had large catteries where felines were bred for slaughter.

The research project, headed by Jennifer Kurushima, a scientist at the University of California Davis, said: ‘Modern cats can trace their genealogy to the time of the pharaohs.

'The Egyptians may well have been the first cat breeders, an important step in the domestication process of cats.’

The Egyptians revered cats and it is heavily featured in Ancient Egyptian art as early as 4,000 BC.

They worshiped feline goddesses like Mafdet, the goddess for protection of dangerous animals, who was most commonly depicted as a woman with a lion or cat-head, and more famously Bastet, the cat goddess of beauty, women and fertility.

It was to these two goddesses that the Egyptians sacrificed the ancestors of the modern domesticated cat more than 2,200 years ago.

The aim of the study was to find genetic similarities between the mummified cats and modern cats and wild cats, to work out how long ago humans turned them into pets.

Kurushima and team extracted mitochondrial DNA from three mummified cats found in tombs and compared it with samples from modern wild cats and domestic cats.

Kurushima said: ‘Millions of cat mummies were offered and buried in areas throughout Egypt.

‘To supply the demand for votive offerings, catteries were established to raise large numbers of felines for slaughter.’

Cats have long been popular household pets not only for their cuddly fur and great companionship.

Their vermin hunting skills led to cats becoming popular as pets in North Africa nearly 4,000 years ago, apart from a period of time in the Middle Ages when they were hunted alongside ‘witches’ and accused of being associated with the devil.
