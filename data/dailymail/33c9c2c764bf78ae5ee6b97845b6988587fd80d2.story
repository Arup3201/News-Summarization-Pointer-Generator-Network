Krystal Barter created the Pink Hope charity in 2009 as she was recovering from a double mastectomy 

Krystal Barter is Australia's answer to Angelina Jolie.

Not only did she carry the same faulty BRCA1 gene that prompted her to undergo a double mastectomy, but the 31-year-old has also proved she has the same star pulling power of the Hollywood A-lister.

The mother-of-three and founder of the Pink Hope charity has signed on a number of high profile Australians including Victoria's Secret Model Jess  Hart and sister Ashley, the Prime Minister's wife Margie Abbott and the daughter of the country's richest woman Bianca Rinehart for her charity campaign.

The charity's latest project, Bright Pink Lipstick Day, is a social media campaign that encourages more people to discuss their hereditary health.

'We're very fortunate to have these women. It's a huge honour to have the Prime Minister's wife leading the charge. To have someone of her calibre mean we're fighting for something that's right,' Ms Barter told Daily Mail Australia.

'These women have become like my friends and it's pretty amazing.' 

Other celebrities who have jumped on-board include Jesinta Campbell, Lisa Wilkinson, Laura Csortan, Natalie Gruzlewski, Kyly Clarke and Nicole Trunfio.

Pink Hope, Australia's only hereditary health charity, will use Bright Pink Lipstick Day on September 26 as an opportunity to encourage people to find about their hereditary health in a bid to prevent breast and ovarian cancers. 

'There's three questions people need to ask: Has anyone had cancer, at what age were they diagnosed and what type of cancer was it?' Ms Barter said. 

'I know there's hundreds or thousands of people at risk of hereditary cancer. Bright Pink Lipstick Day encourages people to make a promise to kiss and tell.'

Ms Barter was 22 when she found out she carried the faulty BRCA1 gene.

She was just 25 when she had a double mastectomy - four years before Angelina Jolie famously revealed she underwent the procedure.

'Growing up, every woman in my family was sick, that was normal,' she said. 

'When they found changes in my breast tissue I said 'I'm not becoming a pin cushion for biopsies'... I wanted (my breasts) gone.' 

Ms Barter, who started Pink Hope as she recovering from her mastectomy, said she felt alienated because it wasn't a common procedure. 

'But that changed when Angelina Jolie did it. I've seen a big shift within the past 12 months. Three days after Angelina Jolie made her announcement, the number of people accessing our services jumped 701 per cent,' she said.

The lipstick, worn here by TheyAllHateUs bloggers, will be sold at Priceline stores or on the charity's website 

Ms Barter said she'll be wearing her pink lipstick tomorrow in memory of her grandmother, who died just two months. 

'I was in my hospital bed having surgery when my nan passed away,' she said. 

'I went in about 8 weeks ago to have my fallopian tubes and an ovary removed. She wanted me to have my surgery so she didn't tell me she was sick.

'I've had a very sick mum for a long time and I've had all these women in my family who are now not here or not 100 percent (because of cancer)… I'm trying to use our family story to make a positive impact.' 

Model Jess Hart designed a lipstick through her cosmetic brand LUMA especially for Pink Hope. 

It will be sold exclusively through Priceline stores nationwide or online at www.pinkhope.org.au for RRP $19.95 with all proceeds going to the Pink Hope Charity.

Bright Pink Lipstick Day will take place on Friday, September 26.
