Victoria Beckham is giving up her high-heel addiction in the run up to New York fashion week.

The designer with a famous penchant for sky-high Louboutins shared a picture of the flat shoes she's 'living in' with her Twitter and Instagram followers yesterday.

She accompanied the snap with the message: 'Obsessed with my @Stubbs_Wootton slippers! #livinginthesetillshowday ! X vb #NYFW #VBAW14'.

Victoria Beckham has tweeted about her love of a £245 pair of velvet slipper shoes

The velvet slippers from American brand 
Stubbs & Wootton cost £245 ($400) and can be 
purchased from their Palm Beach or New York City store, or online.

Mother-of-four Victoria, 39 - who once said she 'couldn't concentrate in flats' and 'beyond hated' ballet shoes - will spend this week, one of the busiest in the fashion calendar, in flats after she was first told to ditch the heels back in August 2011.

She suffered a slipped disc following the birth of daughter Harper Seven that July and was under doctor's orders to wear comfortable shoes.

But wearing flat shoes doesn't come easy to the former Spice Girl.

At one of her first LA appearances in 2007, high-heel addict Victoria, who has spoken of her bunion problems, couldn't face flat shoes and wore 6in platform trainers to throw out the opening pitch at Dodger Stadium.

And during her four pregnancies, a time when most women embrace a more casual shoe, Victoria continued to wear her favourite towering stiletto heels.

But maybe her new-found love of a smoking shoe means that she has turned over a new leaf?

Victoria Instagrammed this picture of her decorating a Christmas tree in heels last year with the message 'Christmas can be dangerous fashion bunnies! #VBXMAS x vb.'

The shoes are available to buy online and in the American stores of brand Stubbs & Wootton

In Nov 2012 Victoria's then-13-year-old son Brooklyn towered over her as she uncharacteristically wore flats

Spice Girl turned designer Victoria has always taken a keen interest in fashion.

And
 now Victoria Beckham says she found a way to make her compulsory school
 outfit look less 'horrific', with the idea quickly catching on amongst 
her classmates.

'I created a
 fashion where you'd wear two pairs of socks - one pair on top of the 
other because it kind of bagged around the ankle,' she said.

'In my eyes, it changed how you looked in this horrific school uniform. It spread like wildfire.'

The baggy, double sock look was popular with school girls around the time Victoria was at school

And the designer -
 who has children Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two,
 with husband David - was such a fan of labels, she used a Gucci carrier
 bag to tote her books and belongings to school.

She
 said: 'It was a Gucci carrier bag - not a proper Gucci bag, a carrier 
bag that I would lug all of my books to school in. I would use that day 
in day out, until the bottom of the thing fell out.'

Despite
 her Posh Spice image, Victoria also admitted her famous black dress she
 wore in the Spice Girls was high street rather than designer.

Speaking
 in her Skype documentary Five Years - The Victoria Beckham Story, she 
said: 'The first dress I wore in the Spice Girls that everybody thought 
was a little black Gucci dress was actually from Miss Selfridge. I 
couldn't have afforded a little black Gucci dress.'
