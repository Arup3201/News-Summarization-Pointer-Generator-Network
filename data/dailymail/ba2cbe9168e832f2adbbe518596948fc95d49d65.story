Wearing dark glasses and striding across the dreary London streets in her yoga trousers, she could be any other harried mother on the school run.

But Helen Fielding, 55, hasn’t much in common with other North London mums.

It’s not just the expensive highlights or £13,000 gold Cartier watch which set her apart from her contemporaries, it’s that she is what her alter‑ego Bridget Jones would call a ‘singleton’ in a sea of smug marrieds.

Her relationship status isn’t the only thing causing the multi-millionairess the odd sleepless night. Her principal worry is: does anyone want to hear from Bridget Jones again?

For after more than a decade of complete obscurity, Fielding has written a new Bridget Jones book, Mad About The Boy, which will be published next month.

The first book, which depicted the life of perennially single thirtysomething Bridget — who memorably chronicled her weight and alcohol consumption each day in her diary with notes such as ‘130lb (terrifying slide into obesity — why? why?), alcohol units 6 (excellent)’ — sold more than 16 million copies.

The novel spawned a 1999 sequel, Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason, and two films — not to mention a whole genre of copycat, less-than-brilliant novels about thirtysomethings waiting for Mr Right — and made Fielding a £30 million fortune.

Following her success, Fielding moved to Los Angeles, where she had two children with Kevin Curran, a television executive on The Simpsons, and virtually retired from writing.

Today, she is so fabulously wealthy that she is in the fortunate position of needing to work only if she cares to.

So why the return to Bridget and to Britain?

Helen said earlier this year that she had ‘surprised’ herself by starting to write a new Bridget Jones’s diary.

‘After the books and the movies I sort of lost my voice; I got all self-conscious. I didn’t want to just churn out another one. I really care about Bridget, about her as a character and about her integrity,’ she said.

‘But suddenly, about a year ago, I had a story again. I was finding things funny and writing things in my diary, and it started turning into a book.’

The plot of the upcoming novel is a closely guarded secret, but the famous daily headings about alcohol, cigarettes and weight will be a thing of the past.

Instead, Helen hints that Bridget is obsessed with Twitter. And gone are the days when all Bridget had to worry about was the circumference of her thighs, for she will be a mother to more than one child in her new incarnation.

Fielding said: ‘She is older, so in the same way as I was looking at being a single thirtysomething in Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason, now I’m looking at being older . . . and, yes, looking at motherhood.

‘Where Bridget was trying to be a better girl or sex goddess, to be thinner and eat less, now she’s basically trying not to lose the children by checking her Twitter followers while they are up a tree or something.

‘Motherhood is certainly a rich seam of comedy. But she does keep the children alive throughout the book, otherwise that would rather spoil it.’

While loyal fans will clearly rejoice at the prospect of a new instalment of Bridget’s life, Helen is said to be ‘nervous’ about how it will be received when it is published next month — worried enough to ask the opinion of her teenage goddaughter, Scarlett, who happens to also be the daughter of screenwriter Richard Curtis.

Scarlett, thankfully, was positive and bolstered her godmother’s fragile ego. But, sadly, the wider reaction to news of more Bridget Jones has been mixed, with some dismissing her heroine as irrelevant, irritating and old hat. Indeed, the real reason for Fielding putting pen to paper, and hopping on a plane back to Britain, seems nothing to celebrate.

She has abandoned her LA life — which included lunching with her best friend, the actress and author Carrie Fisher, and British actress Tracey Ullman — because her relationship with Curran has ended. She quietly separated from him back in 2009.

The pair met in 2000 when she was on an LA-based publicity tour for Bridget Jones and he just happened to be lingering in the lobby of her hotel. They swiftly moved in together, and Fielding upped sticks and left London.

She had experienced a series of unhappy romances in her 30s, once remarking that she’d had more than one Daniel Cleaver — the bad boy in Bridget Jones — in her life.

But with Curran, who had been married and divorced before, it seemed she had found a late-blooming ‘happy ever after’. She said that he was ‘very sweet’ and ‘very funny’.  Baby Dashiell, named after the crime writer Dashiell Hammett, was born in 2004.

Curran proposed marriage when she was 48 and pregnant with their second baby, Romy, who was born in 2006.

She said at the time: ‘It was a surprise. [Kevin] said he’d got me a present, but I thought it was a slow cooker because I’d been going on about it.’

In fact, they never married — Helen claimed that she was enjoying being engaged too much to spoil it. The couple lived a lovely life of pampered seclusion in Hollywood, where her home is just around the corner from Keanu Reeves’s, and took holidays in Barbados with friends, or at five-star resorts in Mexico. Helen loved her champagne, her pool and the waving palms.

She looked giddily happy at various Hollywood events and was regularly seen having dinner at the Chateau Marmont with Curran, whose silver hair makes him look older than he is.

One Hollywood friend tells me that she and Curran made a ‘wonderful couple’, but adds: ‘He is one of those people who doesn’t suffer fools gladly at all, and she can also be quite the diva — she has a sense of how important she is.’

But then, one person’s diva is another person’s successful woman.

Indeed, Fielding, a Yorkshire girl who attended St Anne’s College, Oxford, can be quite assertive. She took on the estate agent and the surveyor who sold them their home after the leaky roof collapsed. And one friend of hers, who I contacted this week, was extremely anxious about Fielding ‘hitting the roof’ over publicity.

Another, who has been involved in the Bridget Jones movies, says that Fielding has a reputation for being uncompromising — or ‘difficult’ — when it comes to anything creative.

There were ‘really major bloody rows’ over both films and also the mooted stage play, which nearly reached the West End this year but has been delayed until at least next year.

There have also been arguments over the possible third Bridget Jones movie, which the film company Working Title has been beavering away on for years now without coming close to shooting.

As far as Curran goes, neither has disclosed what caused the end of their relationship. A source close to the family tells me that they remain ‘good friends’ and that Fielding has kept her £2.2 million cream-painted home in Los Angeles so that the children can go to see Curran in the holidays.

‘They are still very good friends. He comes over, while they see him when they go over,’ she said.

For her part, Fielding has moved into a tall £2.5 million Georgian townhouse in North London, with a nanny for company in the daytime.

She has been quietly moving among the local mums, most of them a decade her junior, for two years now. Apparently she rather sticks out at the school gate, with her lovely blow-dry and penchant for leather trousers and Prada bags — and lack of a husband.

There seems to be no new man on the scene for Fielding. Her lifestyle is back to that of the resolute singleton. She is seen out with various good female friends, but never with a man in tow. In January, she took a holiday with another married couple and her children in Oman.

Recently, she took another holiday with her old friend Mariella Frostrup, who is a key member of her London circle. Like her, Mariella came late to motherhood, and she left her husband behind in London to go on a mums-only holiday with Fielding.

It’s no surprise, then, that Fielding has been inspired to write Bridget Jones as a single mum of two children who is navigating the dating scene.

She said: ‘The book will explore this whole world of internet dating where there’s all these cyber-presences who aren’t actually real.

‘And texting. People can have entire relationships via text which are, in some ways, emotionally fulfilling and serve the purpose of a boyfriend, apart from sex.’

If she has had her own dabble with a cyber-romance, then it certainly hasn’t produced a Mr Right.

But then, while she has always denied that the character of Bridget is based on herself, maybe the role of perpetual singleton does suit Helen Fielding, after all.
