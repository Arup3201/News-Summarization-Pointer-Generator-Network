Blackpool have signed winger Michael Jacobs from Wolves on loan until the end of the season.

The 23-year-old has made just four starts this season and has not appeared for Wolves since the start of December.

Attacking midfielder Michael Jacobs, 23, can play on either flank or behind the striker

Jacobs was a key part of the Wolves side that won the League One title last season after joining from Derby, initially on loan, in November 2013. 

He made his name at Northampton, coming through the club's academy to make 100 appearances before Derby swooped in 2012.
