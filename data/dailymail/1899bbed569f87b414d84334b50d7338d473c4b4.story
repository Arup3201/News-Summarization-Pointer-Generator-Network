A woman lost more than seven stone and transformed herself into a beauty while recovering from a devastating collision which left her toothless and unable to walk.

Tindy Chaggar, 38, battled back from her deathbed and is now enjoying a new lease of life as a model, actor and radio presenter.

While working as a trainee solicitor Miss Chaggar was hospitalised for three months after she was struck by a van while walking to work in Canary Wharf in London.

She sustained a punctured lung, a severely broken leg and a ruptured aorta.

In the immediate aftermath of the smash, doctors warned her family that she might not survive.

Miss Chaggar, of Leicester, said: 'The accident was devastating. I experienced permanent memory loss, meaning I had to give up on my career. I was feeling extremely depressed.

'I desperately needed something new to drive me, otherwise I would have just given up on life. Transforming my figure was something to focus on.'

Miss Chaggar had been overweight during her adolescence and years of rushed business lunches had left her keen to shrink her waistline.

She said: 'I was always plump and certainly not sexy, but it didn’t bother me.

'I thought of myself as the one with the brains instead, and for years I was happy with putting myself in that box. Then when I reached my late 20s I decided I wanted what every other girl does - a great wardrobe and an enviable figure.

'I’d started to transform myself by going to the gym and dieting, and was feeling much better about myself.

'But then the accident happened, and instead of battling to drop the pounds I found myself fighting to even survive.'

The van struck her with such force that she was catapulted more than 40 metres down the road.

She was airlifted to hospital for emergency treatment while her family were called down from Leicester for a bedside vigil.

After multiple operations to repair her broken bones, damaged insides, and shattered teeth, Miss Chaggar underwent hours of gruelling physiotherapy to get back on her feet.

She rose to the challenge, but her normal life was far out of reach.

Left virtually immobile in the hospital, her weight crept up to 17st.

Tindy (pictured right following her 7st weight loss) says it is only when she looks back at pictures of herself, such as the snap on the left, that she realises how large she used to be

She said: 'Before the accident I’d had a taste of what it was like to be fit and healthy, and I decided I still wanted that.

'At size 22, I was bigger than I’d ever been. So as soon as I was able to, I started pushing myself.

'The medical staff thought I would never be able to do it, but I remember willing myself on to prove them wrong.

'At one point doctors had even considered amputating my damaged right calf.

'Thankfully they didn’t have to, but it shocked me to realise I didn’t just want to use my leg to walk, I wanted to run.'

Incredibly, in the months after the collision in September 2003 Miss Chaggar started regular gym visits, and swapped the fast food of her previous life for healthier, more nutritious options.

Slowly but surely her waist line started to shrink.

In 2011 she had an abdominoplasty to remove the folds of excess skin her weight loss success had left behind, paid for by a loan.

And last year she reached a new milestone - she now weighs 9st 7lbs stone and wears a size 10. She has recently begun modelling and has launched a career in the media.

Tinday says she has never been more confident and has even launched a new career in media

She said: 'I have so much more confidence now. I’m not perfect, but I feel on top of the world.

'I love clothes shopping and I’m really into make-up too. It’s only looking back through the photographs that I realise how large I actually was.

'But it’s not all about the exterior, the most important thing to me is my health.

'I’m a total gym addict, and although I still suffer from after effects from the accident I don’t let obstacles get in my way. For example, I can’t use the treadmill because my balance is off, so instead I use the cross trainer.

'I believe the only reason I survived the accident is because I’d started going to the gym so my heart was stronger.

'It taught me life is precious, so I want to be as fit and healthy as possible to enjoy every moment.

'My fantastic new figure is just a very welcome bonus.'
