Household incomes will continue to rise next year - but will not return to their pre-crash levels until early 2016, a think tank warned last night.

The forecast from the Resolution Foundation is much more pessimistic than the official Treasury estimate that incomes will return to these levels in the middle of next year.

The economic think tank said that while it expects real household incomes to grow steadily during the course of 2015, they will still not match the pace of growth seen in the early 2000s.

According to its analysis, incomes can be expected to rise by 1.7 per cent over the course of the year, meaning that they are unlikely to regain the level they were before the crash of 2008 until the early months of 2016.

That contrasts with official estimates in the national accounts - based on figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - which suggest a return to pre-crisis income levels by the middle of next year.

Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ‘After years of stagnation it’s encouraging that household incomes are set to rise again through 2015.

‘But household income per capita is still almost £600 lower than it was at the start of 2008 – and this shortfall doesn’t look like being made up until early 2016.

‘Household incomes are arguably the best measure of living standards. Timely and accurate data is therefore vital for making informed judgements on an issue that will feature heavily in the upcoming election.

‘We will hear a lot of claim and counter-claim about living standards over the next five months. In the absence of better statistics, we will have no way of knowing how much of it is true.’

The new analysis found that in 2014, incomes have risen very slightly - up £130 on a low of £16,940 per capita in late 2013.

But this is still £600 - or 3.3 per cent - below their pre-downturn peak.

The independent think tank found that household incomes are expected to grow by 1.7 per cent in 2015.

It said this would be a welcome return to the levels of steady income growth seen in the mid-2000s - but was well short of the strong growth seen at the start of that decade.

The foundation warned that it will take some time to make up for the ground lost over recent years.

A return to pre-downturn household incomes is unlikely to occur until early 2016.

Similarly, the Resolution Foundation does not expect household incomes to have returned to the level seen at the time of last election until early 2016.

It means that incomes will end the Parliament slightly lower than they started it, despite the recent recovery and expected growth in early 2015.

The think tank challenged the way the ONS measures real household disposable income - in part because it includes the incomes of several non-household organisations, such as universities, charities and trade unions.

It has also questioned the way that the ONS calculates the impact of inflation on household incomes.
