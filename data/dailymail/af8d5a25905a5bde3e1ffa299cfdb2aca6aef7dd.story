Strolling in the sunshine as a free man, this is one of the three monsters who killed Baby Peter.

Jason Owen is back on the streets after serving just two years for a crime that horrified a nation.

The sadistic 39-year-old was jailed over the death, abuse and torture of the 17-month-old.

Monster's ink: Owen's right arm is tatooed with 'Only God can Judge me'

Casually walking down the street in smart new clothes, he looked relaxed, slim and fit. On his right arm was a tattoo with the provocative slogan ‘Only God can judge me’.

He was heading back to a probation hostel for high-risk offenders.

Owen was freed earlier this month and must live at the secret location while adjusting to life outside prison.

Sources said he had thrown himself into an extreme fitness regime behind bars, including runs of as long as eight miles.

He now bears little resemblance to the scruffy, bloated and hollow-eyed police mugshot taken in 2007 that accompanied the haunting stories of Peter Connelly’s suffering at his home in Haringey, North London.

The release of Owen is the latest 
painful injustice that has characterised the case.

Inquiries, official 
reports and court hearings have laid bare how Baby Peter was failed by 
the authorities at every turn.

Sharon
Shoesmith, the former Haringey children’s services chief, is even in 
line for £1million compensation from the taxpayer over her sacking.

She has expressed ‘sorrow’ for Peter’s death but has never apologised for her role in the failings of her department.

The toddler suffered terrible abuse with 50 injuries, including a broken back, before he died in August 2007.

Owen
and his brother Steve Barker, 35, who was Baby Peter’s stepfather, were
convicted of causing or allowing the child’s death in 2008.

Baby Peter’s mother Tracey Connelly, 30, admitted the same offence at the Old Bailey.

It
emerged that officials assigned to Peter did not ask about Barker, who 
was Connelly’s boyfriend, even when she listed him as next of kin.

Had they done so they would have discovered he had been suspected of torturing his grandmother.

Social workers considered the child’s care to be ‘a routine, low-risk case’.

His mother was ‘disorganised, dirty and smelly’ and ‘without much conscience’, but thought too intimidating to ‘confront’.

Doctors
also missed signs that the toddler’s injuries were deliberately 
inflicted, even though police strongly suspected this was the case.

Owen
was freed after serving half of a six-year sentence for causing or 
allowing Peter’s death – having spent around 300 days in custody on 
remand before his trial.

The
convicted arsonist, crack addict and National Front member wanted 
plastic surgery and a new identity on his release from Wandsworth.

But he was given neither and is struggling to keep a low profile in a bid to avoid reprisal attacks.

He also wanted a seaside council house with his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his five children.
