A shopper found more than he expected while unpacking his groceries when a snake popped out.

Dean Gibbon had been shopping in Slatyford, Tyne and Wear, before returning home to nearby Throckley when he put his carrier bag full of shopping on the kitchen bench.

But the 60-year-old yelled in horror and ran out of the room when the bag started to move and a nine-inch Corn Snake with a diamond pattern on its back appeared.

Snake: Dean Gibbon found more than he expected upon his return from a shopping trip in Tyne and Wear

Scary moment: Mr Gibbon yelled in horror and ran out of his kitchen when the shopping bag started to move and a nine-inch Corn Snake with a diamond pattern on its back appeared

Mr Gibbon said: ‘I’d put the carrier bag down on the bench and it suddenly started moving. Then out comes this snake. I just yelled and ran out the room - I couldn’t believe it.

‘I was taking the stuff out of the carrier bag and noticed there was something moving inside. Before I had a chance to look, this snake appeared. It must have been about nine inches long.

‘After running out the room, I went back in and took hold of it, putting it into a kind of bottle until I knew what to do. A couple of times it looked like it was going to have a go at me, to strike out.’

Mr Gibbon believes the snake may have been curled up in a pair of thick socks which he had bought during the shopping trip on Saturday.

He added: ‘I think it’s maybe been keeping warm in them before coming out once I arrived back.’

Wayne Mailer, who runs Dragons Den Exotic Pets in Newcastle, said: ‘Looking at the picture, this appears to be an Anery Corn Snake.

‘I think it’s probably only a hatchling - maybe only a few weeks old. At the minute it doesn’t appear to be in the best of health, probably due to the cold weather. More than likely, it is an escaped pet.’

Corn Snakes are native to Central America and the south-east of North America. They have been popular in the UK as pets for many years and are viewed as a good beginner’s snake for those new to reptile keeping.

The average size for an adult Corn Snake is around four to five foot. Mr Gibbon's snake is now keeping warm in a cardboard box in an effort to build up its strength.

The snakes, which are said to be easy to tame and rarely bite,  can be bought for about £30 each.
