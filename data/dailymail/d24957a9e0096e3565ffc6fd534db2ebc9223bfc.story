The family of Winston Churchill, pictured, have donated 37 of his paintings to the state following the death of his one remaining child

A collection of Winston Churchill’s paintings has been given to the public by the late Prime Minister’s family to settle a multi-million pound tax bill.

The politician’s family was left owing £9.4million in inheritance tax following the death of his last surviving child Lady Mary Soames last year.

But rather than selling off the prized collection of 37 paintings, his family has given the paintings to the nation under a specialist tax scheme for important pieces of art.

As part of the deal the vast majority of the paintings will be permanently displayed to the public at Chartwell, Churchill’s former home that is now run by the National Trust.

The wartime Prime Minister took up the hobby at the age of 41 and continued painting in a figurative style into his 80s, producing more than 500 works.

Although his amateur offerings never received mass critical acclaim, they have attracted huge prices on the private market from avid fans of ‘Churchilliana’ buyers.

The value of his paintings was highlighted last year when The Goldfish Pool at Chartwell – depicting the garden feature which he dug and visited daily - was sold for a record £1.8m.

Despite selling many of his prized possessions at auction last year, Lady Soames’s will included a request that the paintings remain on display at Chartwell.

She also asked that Coast Scene near Cannes should remain in the Houses of Parliament and that View From a Bathing Hut at the Miami Surf Club stays in the Churchill War Rooms.

Lady Soames, who died last June at the age of 91, previously described how painting ‘literally ‘grabbed’ her father in 1915.

She credited the hobby for ‘playing an increasing and abiding role in his life, renewing the source of his great inner strength and enabling him to face storms, ride out depressions and rise above the tough passages in his political life’.

The items were donated to the nation under the acceptance in lieu scheme, which allows people to offset inheritance tax against valuable items of cultural significance.

The scheme sees the Government accept the items for the full market value, provided they can be permanently bequeathed to a museum or gallery.

It also offers a ‘good deal’ for those offering up historically important items, with works avoiding the taxes associated with a sale on the private market.

Inheritance tax is paid at 40 per cent when an estate exceeds £325,000 but the scheme sees the amount of tax incurred by the objects reduced to 25 per cent of its market value.

The secretary of state for culture, media and sport is responsible for deciding whether the items offer a good deal for the taxpayer after being advised by a board of experts.

The Government has accepted items worth £124.5 million instead of tax between 2009 and 2013.

The Churchill family has previously courted controversy after benefitting from the sale of prized possession to the state.

The war leader’s collection of pre-1945 speeches and letter was sold to the nation in 1995 for £12.5million using money from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

As well as 37 of Churchill’s paintings, the collection also included a painting by Sir John Lavery and the Aly Khan Gold Cup, which was won by Churchill’s horse High Hat in 1961.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: ‘It is fitting that in the 50th year since his death these paintings by the great war-time leader Sir Winston Churchill will be displayed in three very significant locations that helped shape his life and gives us an opportunity to appreciate the artistic talent of a man who was a colossal figure in world politics.’

Chairman of the Acceptance in Lieu Panel Edward Harley said: ‘Fifty years after his death and 70 years after the end of the War, Churchill remains one of this nation’s greatest figures.

‘His paintings let us see the man in the round and not just as a great politician.’
