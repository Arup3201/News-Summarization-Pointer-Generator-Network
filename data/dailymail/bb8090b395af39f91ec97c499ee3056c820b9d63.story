Breach of trust: Jochen Teizer was revealed by Georgia Tech officials to have forced students to give him at least $20,000 in under the table payments

A graduate professor at Georgia Tech has been suspended after it was revealed he forced students into under the table payments despite earning a six-figure salary.

Jochen Teizer, of Atlanta, lined his pockets with at least $20,000 in student money going as far back as 2011, the university disclosed in a statement.

The school had first been made aware of the allegations in October but only went public Friday night after WSB called seeking comment, the station said.

Teizer, an associate professor of construction engineering, is believed to have accepted $10,000 in payments in 2011 from one student alone, said the statement.

He coerced mostly Asian current and former students into handing over the cash despite raking in about $125,000 in salary, the station said. Not all of his victims were fluent in English.

Teizer has been placed on leave while the process to have him dismissed has begun, the school said. 

The students will also be fully refunded the amount of the nefarious payments made to Teizer, said the statement.

The disgraced professor insisted off-camera to WSB he never spent the money and intended to use it for his research, the station reported.

His biography was removed from the Georgia Tech website by Saturday morning, and messages left for comment were not returned.

Teizer appeared to be a relatively-like professor on campus, he received 3.5 out of 5 stars in online ratings.

Students said his classes were dry, but he was a reasonable professor â€“ unless, of course, he demanded a kickback.

It is not clear if Teizer will face criminal charges for his actions.
