Thirteen-year-old Suhayb Hassan died after being shot in the chest

A teenage boys' game of 'cops and robbers' turned tragic when a 15-year-old killed his younger brother with their dad's pistol.

The older boy unintentionally shot his 13-year-old brother Suhayb Hassan after they discovered their father's gun at their Minnesota home, police said Monday.

Police and paramedics arrived at the home in Eagan, south of St. Paul, on Sunday morning after the 15-year-old reported his younger brother was unresponsive and bleeding.

The older boy originally told dispatchers his brother had fallen and stabbed himself while running with a knife.

But when police arrived, the older boy told the officers he had accidentally shot his brother.

'I believe at the time he was very scared because he knew he wasn’t supposed to be playing with the firearm,' Detective Desiree Schroepfer said. 

'And he was concerned that he was going to get in trouble for that.' 

Police said they do not anticipate any arrests in the case. 

The boys were home alone with their 11-year-old sister when they found an unloaded 9 mm pistol belonging to their father. 

A magazine with cartridges for the gun was nearby, police said, though they refused to discuss specifics about the weapon's storage.

At some point, the firearm was loaded, then thought to be unloaded while the boys chased each other as they played 'cops and robbers,' investigators said.

Police said the 15-year-old fired one round that struck Suhayb, an eighth grader at nearby Blackhawk Middle School, in the chest, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. 

The boy died at the scene despite attempts by paramedics to save his life.

The 11-year-old sister did not witness the shooting and was not hurt, police said.

While police said the shooting 'appears to be a horrible accident,' the results of their investigation will be presented to the Dakota County Attorney's Office for review. 

The 13-year-old's middle school notified students of the death on Monday morning and said that it would provide extra counsellors for students. 

The death marks the second tragedy in a year for Blackhawk Middle School after fourteen-year-old Patrick Schoonover, also an eighth grader, died in November after collapsing during a hockey tournament.

'Two deaths, two months, hundreds of broken hearts, #RIPSuhayb, #RIPPatrick,' Twitter user Josalyn Dehncke wrote. 

The Centers for Disease Control predicted that guns would kill more Americans than automobile accidents in 2015.
