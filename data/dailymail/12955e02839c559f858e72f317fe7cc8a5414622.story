A Detroit mailman is being hailed a hero after tackling a house fire he spotted while doing his regular delivery round on Tuesday morning.

After calling the fire brigade, Darrian Crutcher used a garden hose to douse the flames in a move homeowner Carolyn Patterson says saved her house and life.

After firefighters arrived however, the mailman just continued with his round without a second thought to his life-saving actions.

Heroic: Detroit mailman Darrian Crutcher helped put out a fire

'I said, "Ok, they there. The real firemen is here now so I can go ahead and do my job",' Mr Crutcher told Fox 2 as he played down claims that he was a hero.

His quick-thinking actions have been credited with saving Ms Patterson's home after incense she lit set fire to her living room.

'It was really burning,' she said. 'I think this room probably would've burned up. I really do.'

Mr Crutcher said he was just concerned for the safety of Ms Patterson and a child who was outside the home.Â 

'It was a blessing for me to be at that 
spot at that particular time,' he said, adding he hoped someone would help him if he was in a similar situation.

Firefighters
have also praised Mr Crutcher's quick thinking. David Weems of Detroit 
Fire Department said he suggested the mailman joined them after doing 
such a great job.

'It's great just to see citizens just stopping to do the good - the good of man,' Mr Weems said.

Mr Crutcher can now be ranked among 
other heroic mailmen, including North Carolina postal worker Michael 
Wheeley, Ohio's Jason Jones, and Illinois's Kathy Stratton, the Huffington Post reported.

All
three helped raise the alarm that residents living on their route had 
fallen ill, after noticing they had failed to pick up mail.
