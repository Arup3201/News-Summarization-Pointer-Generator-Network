Football and the pub - From Sir Alf to Dixie Dean

Life's a beach for Best, Becks and Sir Bobby 

The way television covers football has changed immeasurably over the decades, and nowadays we can watch matches played all over the world at the press of a button.

One programme has survived, and indeed thrived, during all these changes and has become the most popular and iconic TV football show in the country.

Sportsmail's nostalgic picture series Golden Years this week pays tribute to Match of the Day as the BBC's famous football programme celebrates its 50th birthday.

We have pictures from some of the presenters and commentators that have graced the programme over the decades, including legendary figures such as Kenneth Wolstenholme and David Coleman, and today's favourites including Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer.

We would very much welcome your memories in the comments section, and we'll return next week with more special pictures from the archives.

Match of the Day has gone from humble beginnings 50 years ago to becoming the most famous of all TV sports programmes. The first broadcast came on August 22, 1964, and half a century later it is shown to millions of viewers every Saturday night. This special picture to celebrate the 50 years of Match of the Day shows those most closely associated with the programme - David Coleman, Gary Lineker, Kenneth Wolstenholme, Jimmy Hill and Des Lynam

Match of the Day was first shown in the early evening of August 22, 1964, on BBC2, with an estimated audience of 20,000. The game shown was between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield, where the hosts claimed a 3-2 win. Here's a picture of Liverpool's Gordon Wallace beating Arsenal defender Don Howe and goalkeeper Jim Furnell to head home. Below, the Anfield crowd appear entertained by a cat that managed to find himself the centre of attention for a while that day

Match of the Day's first presenter was Kenneth Wolstenholme, the man who will forever be remembered for speaking the words 'They think it's all over... it is now' when England scored their fourth goal against West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley. Here  is Wolstenholme for a Match of the Day broadcast from Upton Park in 1966, and a match between West Ham and Sheffield United. Below, Wolstenholme describes the action in east London using a classic lip microphone

As viewers, we naturally preoccupy ourselves by what we see on screen - the presenters, pundits and action. But there is a whole other world in the background  and here's a picture of executive producer Alec Weeks at the controls in 1974. Weeks was executive producer of the programme between 1965 and 1980

This 1974 picture shows a BBC cameraman close to the action at Portman Road, for a match between Ipswich and Liverpool that was to be shown on that evening's Match of the Day. Liverpool went down to a surprise 1-0 defeat that November afternoon, and ended up runners-up in Division One to Derby. Match of the Day was very much a colour television affair for many viewers by then - the first match shown in colour on the programme was Liverpool v West Ham in 1969

John Motson first became properly known to a wider audience when he commentated on Hereford's memorable FA Cup upset win over Newcastle in 1972, and he went on to become the BBC's lead commentator. Here he is pictured (left) before a match between Ipswich and Middlesbrough in 1982. On the right, one of the finest broadcasters of all time, David Coleman at Old Trafford for a clash between Manchester United and Sheffield United in 1971. Coleman, who died last year, also presented much of the BBC's other sporting output, including the Saturday afternoon programme Grandstand. He also covered 11 summer Olympics and six World Cup finals

For a couple of generations of viewers, Barry Davies was one of the main voices of TV football. Here he is at Anfield for Match of the Day in 1974. Davies first worked on the programme in 1969, and continued until 2004. Probably the most famous line he uttered in football commentary came in 1974, when Derby's Francis Lee scored against Manchester City - 'Interesting... Very interesting. Look at his face. Just look at his face.'

The presenter most associated with Match of the Day for a certain generation must  be Jimmy Hill, who fronted the programme between 1973 and 1988. The former Fulham and Brentford forward, and Coventry manager, had worked for LWT before joining the BBC. Above, he presents Match of the Day in 1973

Another fine 1970s picture of Hill above, this time with him preparing for broadcast just minutes before Match of the Day was due to go on air in 1975 by smoking a pipe. Below, Hill in glorious technicolour in 1981. During the 1980-81 and 1982-83 seasons, the programme was moved to a Sunday afternoon, but for the vast majority of its history, Match of the Day has remained a Saturday night show

The years and decades come and go, and yet there is still one constant with Match of the Day - the voice of Motson. Above, him in arguably his most famous scene, reporting from a snowy Adams Park before an FA Cup match between Wycombe and Peterborough that, before it was postponed, was due to be shown on Match of the Day that evening. Between 1988 and 1992, ITV had exclusive terrestrial rights to top-flight football, with the BBC rebranding a more occasional Saturday programme 'Match of the Day - The Road To Wembley'. Below, Motson pictured at Newcastle's St James' Park ground in 2005. He has been going nearly as long as the show itself

It was the end of an era in September, 2004, when Davies commentated on his last match for Match of the Day, a clash between Manchester City and Arsenal. Hehad commentated for the programme for 35 years - his first was for Crystal Palace vs Manchester United in August, 1969. That week 10 years ago, Davies said: 'It is not easy to give up something that has been a major part of my working life but I think I have had a good innings.'

Match of the Day has surely never had a more unflappable host than Des Lynam. When the BBC won back rights to show top-flight football in 1992, Lynam was in his element, and fronted the famous highlights programme every Saturday night. Alan Hansen, once a cultured defender with Liverpool and Scotland, became the most recognisable pundit - and he uttered probably the most famous line in Match of the Day history in 1995 when he was talking about a defeat for Manchester United at Aston Villa and said 'You can't win anything with kids'. Here's Hansen and Lynam pictured with former West Ham great-turned-pundit Sir Trevor Brooking

In the early days of the programme, Match of the Day used to show one game, which soon became two. By the 1990s and the start of the Premier League era, key moments of every match were  shown. Here's a picture of the control room in 1997, with a match between Leicester and Tottenham showing on the various screens

When Lynam made a surprise move to ITV in 1999, Gary Lineker took over as the main presenter of Match of the Day. Here he is pictured with Hansen in 2001. Lineker enjoyed an oustanding playing career before he moved into broadcasting, with spells at Everton, Barcelona and Tottenham. He also starred for England, scoring 48 goals and producing a host of brilliant performances at the World Cup finals of 1986 and 1990

Forty years after Match of the Day was first shown, the BBC decided to expand its weekend coverage, with a Sunday programme called Match of the Day 2 introduced in 2004. The first presenter of the programme was Adrian Chiles, who is pictured here on the set in 2007. Chiles is now the lead presenter for ITV's football coverage

Jacqui Oatley became the first woman to commentate for Match of the Day in 2007 when she described the match between Fulham and Blackburn at Craven Cottage, a game that finished in a 1-1 draw. Oatley began her career on radio, and has covered a host of major sporting events during her time in television 

The amount of live football shown on television increases each year, but Match of the Day continues to be enjoyed by millions every weekend. The above promo picture shows Alan Shearer, Mark Lawrenson, Gary Lineker and Alan Hansen before the 2007-08 season. Below, Messrs Hansen, Lineker and Shearer are ready to watch the Saturday afternoon action, in preparation for an evening broadcast, in 2009

The Match of the Day team moved to a new home in Salford in 2011, a short distance away from Manchester United's Old Trafford ground. The programme seems to go from strength to strength as the seasons go on, with the main Saturday programme and Sunday's Match of the Day 2 now joined by Match of the Day 2 Extra and Match of the Day 3. Other famous sports programmes have gone, the likes of Grandstand and Sportsnight, and yet Match of the Day continues to not just survive, but thrive

We couldn't leave without mentioning that famous theme tune, which wasn't actually used from the start of the programme, but was introduced in 1970. Composer Barry Stoller created the tune for the show in his north London basement, and over the decades it has become one of the most famous television tunes of all time. The below video shows the theme being used for the first time in 1970, with David Coleman presenting the programme...
