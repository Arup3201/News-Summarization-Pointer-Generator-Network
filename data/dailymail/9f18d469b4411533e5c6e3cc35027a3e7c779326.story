A multi-million-dollar penthouse that overlooks one of Australia's most iconic beaches is on the market after its Russian owners, who bought it eight years ago, have decided to sell up.

The Circle on Cavill penthouse on Queensland's Gold Coast overlooks the crystal waters of Surfers Paradise and offers up an almost 360-degree view of the popular tourist destination.

There are no estimates of what the property will go for when it comes up for auction on July 17, but the Gold Coast Bulletin reports Russian businessman ­Sergey Katsiev and his partner, ­Liudmila, bought the apartment in 2006 for $5.45 million.

The Circle on Cavill penthouse - on the corner of Cavill Avenue and the Gold Coast Highway - is on the 48th floor

Mr Katsiev is listed as on Forbes' billionaires list and he has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion.

The business magazine said the 56-year-old got his start in tobacco after the Soviet Union disbanded. In 2006, tobacco products importer Mercury Tobacco Corporation - then owned by his partner Igor Kesaev -  was incorporated into Katsiev's Megapolis, leading to the creation of the nation's largest player in the tobacco products industry.

The Katsievs have two children - but it is believed the businessman and his family rarely visited the property.

The penthouse towers over Surfers Paradise and takes up the entire 48th floor - which spans 669 sq m - with high ceilings and large windows to take in the unrivalled views.

Its lavish surroundings match the apartment's luxurious interior. The house is decked out with Italian Carrara marble floors and benchtops in the kitchen, which is fitted with Miele appliances and an open floor plan.

The lucky new buyer or buyers will have the privilege of enjoying a bath with a view in one of penthouse's four ensuite bathrooms that boasts stunning ocean views.

But the show-stopping feature of the home is the private 15-metre swimming pool - complete with a spa and 10-person sauna - which acts the centrepiece of the outdoor entertainment deck, and offers night views of the bright lights of the coastal city.

The website of exclusive real estate agent Ray White Prestige Gold Coast said this was the first time it had been listed on the market, with the Gold Coast Bulletin reporting it had previously been bought off plan.

Ray White's apartments specialist Tolemy Stevens told the Queensland-based newspaper that the penthouse had already attracted interest from people in Australia and outside of it.

Mr Stevens said a recent viewing of the home brought 18 lots of prospective buyers, and seven people had contacted him by email about the property. it was also performing well online, with 1,000 clicks within its first week of listing.

The future owner will have access to the penthouse from a private lift foyer, four car spaces along with storage space, CCTV, ducted air-conditioning, electronic blinds and C-bus -  a central system that controls the lighting and other electric fixtures of a home.

The Circle on Cavill penthouse is scheduled to go under the hammer on July 17 at 11am.
