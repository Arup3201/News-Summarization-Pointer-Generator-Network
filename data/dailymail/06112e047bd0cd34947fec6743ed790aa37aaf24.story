A lorry driver who killed a policeman who had stopped to help a woman on a motorway with a flat tyre has been jailed.

PC Mark Goodlad, 41, was helping a female motorist with a flat tyre when Andrew Abernethy’s truck smashed into his marked BMW X5 police car on the southbound carriageway of the M1 near Wakefield in West Yorkshire.

Abernethy, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, admitted dangerous driving and was found to be travelling at around 56mph when the accident occurred in October last year.

The 45-year-old claimed he had something irritating his left eye as his lorry, carrying a 17,000lbs load of bedding, drifted from the lane onto the hard shoulder, partly mounting the grass verge.

He then smashed into Mr Goodlad’s car, pinning him between his vehicle and Sharon Burgess’ Suzuki Swift as he helped her.

Father-of-one Mr Goodlad, who had remarried just months earlier, was getting the spare tyre out of Mrs Burgess’ car at the time. He was freed by firemen but died soon afterwards from multiple injuries.

Mrs Burgess was slightly injured and has suffered psychological trauma since the accident, Leeds Crown Court heard.

In sentencing Abernethy to two years and 
nine months jail, Judge Scott Wolstenholme said: ‘You were not paying 
attention to the road for a considerable time and all along trundling 
along in that enormous truck at fifty miles an hour.’

After the case, Mr Goodlad's widow Helen said: ‘The past thirteen months have been agonising.

‘We all know that Mr Abernethy did 
not set out that day with the intention of taking a life but it is 
without doubt that he is solely responsible for the death of my husband 
Mark.’

Abernethy had started driving that 
day just one hour earlier, travelling from his depot in  Middleton, 
Manchester, and was on his way to Chesterfield when the collision 
happened, the court heard.

Andrew Dallas, prosecuting, said that there was no suggestion that Abernethy, a father of a teenage daughter, had fallen asleep at the wheel before the late afternoon crash.

The driver claimed he had suddenly got a pain in his left eye and had taken his spectacles off to ‘remove a foreign object’.

Abernethy said he had woken up that morning feeling a pain in his left eye and a hospital examination did discover an abrasion on the cornea.

He failed to notice that his lorry was drifting onto the hard shoulder and said he did not see the police vehicle, which had its flashing warning lights on, until the last second.

Other drivers said they saw the lorry slowly drift from motorway onto the hard shoulder and one claimed it then hit the police car ‘at full speed’.

Experts said that the lorry could have 
travelled for up to 10 seconds for 820ft along the hard shoulder, 
drifting partly onto the grass verge.

Judge Wolstenholme said he was satisfied
that Abernethy had a problem with his eye but said he had failed to pay
attention to the road ahead.

Abernethy will serve half his jail sentence and was banned from driving for three years.

Mrs
Goodlad said her husband was her ‘life,’ adding: ‘There are no words to
describe how much I love and miss him. He was the most incredible, 
honourable and inspirational person that one could hope to meet.

‘Mark
loved his job and took great pride in his duties; he never overlooked 
any opportunity to help people because that’s why he joined the force 
and that’s where he found himself that day - at the side of a lady 
needing help.

‘It is no exaggeration to say he was one in a billion.’
