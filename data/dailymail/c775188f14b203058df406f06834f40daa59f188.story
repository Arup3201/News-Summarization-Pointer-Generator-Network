The UK may be in the grip of the worst economic crisis in history - but at least we haven't lost our sense of humour.

A new exhibition showcases a series of unintentionally hilarious sights captured by Londoners in their city during 2012. 

S*** London originally started out as a Facebook group which invited members of the public to send in funny photos of everyday mishaps such as clever shop names or unfortunate council signs.

Unintended irony: This entry features a shop called Smokers Paradise next door to a Cancer Research UK charity shop

Surely they did this on purpose? Another entry for the Best/Worst shop name in the S*** London awards

Dark humour: This picture has been entered into the Best Picture category for the S*** London awards

All of a flutter: Another hilarious snap which was sent in to the blog captured this stark warning about one of London's most populous residents

Now a popular blog, the best entries will be shown at an art exhibition in Hoxton.

Creator Patrick Dalton writes on his blog: 'S*** London began life as Facebook group for Londoners to post their pictures of strange and unusual things they spotted on their travels around the city.

'These are photographs of the unintentional human comedy that surround us in the city.

'It’s the flotsam and jetsam of city life, the overlooked minutiae, the tragic, the grotesque and the basest of base.

Unfortunate: A mischievous vandal has given this stall a rather more sinister sound name

Spelling lesson: This entry caught a restaurant which offers an unusual sitting between breakfast and dinner

Blunt: Another entry for Best Picture which captures the darker side of London humour

Sinking feeling: An entry sent in for the best shop name which makes great use of a pun

'There are so many unintentionally amusing things around the city if you just choose to notice them.'

Some of the funniest submissions which have been nominated for the S*** London Awards 2012 include a shop called Smoking Paradise next to a Cancer Research charity store and a dumped mattress daubed with the notice 'Free Matress, No Visible Stains'.

Genius: This billboard headline caught the eye of one bemused Londoner

Protest: Someone has taken strong objection to the orders of Lambeth council

Inspiring: This animating landscape was sent in as an entry for the Most Depressing View from Work category

Lonely hearts: This Londoner looking for love has kept his requirements to a minimum

Spokeswoman Danielle Pender for KK Outlet in Hoxton, where the exhibition runs from 7 December said: 'The images, no matter how grim, are life affirming and reassuring that underneath the modern day desire for perfection and the homogeny of the Tesco filled high street - people are still people, they sometimes make mistakes and life is all the better for them.'

Dalton added: 'What I really like about the site and the whole project is that it encourages people to notice their environment around them a little. I've learnt a lot more about this city from walking about hunting a good shot.'

Organisers are also asking for entrants for the S*** London Awards, with categories including Best/Worst Christmas Decorations, Ugliest London Building, Best/Worst Business Name and Most Depressing View From Work.

Appropriate: An entrant spotted that this particular restaurant has been aptly-located

Enticing: An eagle-eyed Londoner spotted this unfortunate pavement marking that lost some its letters

To the point: Someone feels the need to make their point a little more clearly
