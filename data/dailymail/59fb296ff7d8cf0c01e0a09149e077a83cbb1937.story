Abdullah Elmir's whereabouts remain unknown despite 16-year-old Feiz, who disappeared with him, being found safe and preparing to fly back home with his father

A 16-year-old Sydney teenager has been found safe and is preparing to come home alongside his father, after he ran away to fight in Iraq and Syria in June.

Known as Feiz, the boy from Bankstown in Sydney's west, secretly left the country with Abdullah Elmir, 17, who told his parents he was going fishing.

While Abdullah's whereabouts are still unknown, The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Feiz and his father are currently in Lebanon from where they will travel back to Sydney with assistance from the Australian Federal Police.

Abdullah and Feiz are believed to have made their way to Turkey, from where they were last known to have contacted family members, via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand.

Reports stated that Abdullah's family suspected he was planning to cross the border into Iraq.

It remains unknown who is responsible for paying and organising the two boys' trips.

On Friday, a man named Abu Bakr Al Australi, allegedly became the first Australian responsible for a suicide bombing in Iraq which killed at least five people.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that community members do not believe Abdullah was the Australian behind the attack.

Feiz and Abdullah secretly left their homes in June and flew to Turkey from where they are last known to have contacted family members. They are believed to have been trying to cross the border to Iraq to join the war

Amidst news that the federal government has listed support of an extremist group by an Australia an offence punishable by up to 25 years in jail, Attorney General George Brandis revealed the number of Australians believed to be supporting extremist groups at a press conference earlier this week.

'There are probably about 60 Australians in Syria fighting for one side or the other but predominantly the anti- government side, and an alarming number of those people are gravitating towards the Al-Qaeda off-shoot,' Mr Brandis said.

'We have some 10s of people who have already returned and we have probably another 150 who we are looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements.'

It is believed that Abdullah was most likely recruited to join an Islamic terror group to fight in the troubled war zone after he was brainwashed by Jihadist recruitment videos online.

Abdullah is believed to have been brainwashed by recruitment videos such as this one by the ISIS, titled There Is No Life Without Jihad, which urges people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'

His family said they do no know why he would abandon his family and the promise of a university education and that he had not shown signs of radical behaviour before leaving

The family, who hold grave concerns for his safety, only learnt of his travel arrangements to Iraq via a text message he left with a friend which simply said to tell his mother he was 'gone'.

Australia does not have an embassy or consulate in either Syria or Iraq so the Government's ability to deliver assistance in the Middle East is limited.
