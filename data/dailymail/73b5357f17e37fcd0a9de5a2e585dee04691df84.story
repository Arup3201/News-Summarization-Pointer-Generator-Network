England play their World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus and they have a mixed record in their first match of the tournament.

Here, Sportsmail looks at three times it went to plan - and three times it most certainly did not.

1998 - England 2-0 Tunisia

Alan Shearer’s header and a beauty from Paul Scholes got England off to the best of starts in Marseille. But defeat by Romania in the next game meant a last-16 meeting with Argentina, and another shootout defeat.

1982 - England 3-1 France  

A double from Bryan Robson set England up for the win before Paul Mariner finished off the French in Bilbao. England topped their first group, but did not get out of the second after goalless draws with Germany and Spain.

1950 - England 2-0 Chile            

Stan Mortenson opened the scoring at the Maracana with a header before Wilf Mannion smashed in a second. But 1-0 defeats by the USA and Spain meant it was in vain as England failed to qualify from the group.

2010 - England 1-1 USA

England came flying out of the traps with Steven Gerrard scoring after four minutes but when Rob Green let Clint Dempsey’s shot squirm in it set the tone for a poor campaign, capped by a 4-1 thrashing by Germany in the last 16.

1986 - Portugal 1-0 England

Carlos Manuel’s back-post finish dented England’s chances but they recovered to qualify second in the group, with Portugal missing out. But that quarter-final meeting with Diego Maradona and the hand of God sealed the fate of Bobby Robson’s England.

England's record in the first matches of World Cups:

Played 13. Won 5. Drawn 6. Lost 2

For 19  Against 13 Win% = 38.5

1962 - Hungary 2-1 England

In front of fewer than 8,000 spectators in Rancagua, Chile, England toiled in the rain. Ron Flowers equalised from the spot after a fine strike from Lajos Tichy but Florian Albert’s winner left England second in the group and set up a quarter-final loss to Brazil.
