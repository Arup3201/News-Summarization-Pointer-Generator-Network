One in three Americans drinks to excess, but a small percentage of these drinkers are actually dependent on alcohol.

That's according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control released this month based on data  from 2009 to 2011 collected from around 138,100 respondents about alcohol consumption habits.

The study found while heavy drinking among Americans leads to 88,000 deaths yearly, excess drinking is not necessarily tied to alcoholism, which affects around 3.5 percent of the population.

Consumption: A study by the Centers for Disease Control found that around one in three Americans drinks in excess, though it is not always caused by alcohol dependency

Excessive drinking is defined in the study as 15 or more drinks per week for men and 8 for women, while binge drinking is considered 5 or more drinks a day for men and 4 for women. 

'This study shows that, contrary to popular opinion, most people who drink too much are not alcohol dependent,' said Robert Brewer, CDC epidemiologist and co-author of the study, to NPR. 

Only around 10 percent of those drinking excessively have what is considered alcohol dependency or alcoholism. 

People can be described as alcoholics when affected by a combination of several factors, including being unable to stop or decrease consumption or allowing drinking to interfere with work or relationships. 

'The reality of the situation is that most adults who drink, they're drinking maybe a couple drinks during week and then typically drinking [larger] amounts on weekends.' 

Still, alcohol dependency was found to be much more common among those who drank excessively or binged than non-binge drinkers, among whom only 1.3 percent could be described as alcoholics.

The study also found that some segments of the population are more prone to excessive drinking and binge drinking than others.

Overall, adults ages 18-24 were most likely to be considered heavy or binge drinkers, with 50 percent falling into the category of excessive drinking.

The study notes that for adults between 18 and 20, any drinking reported was considered as excessive. 

While not necessarily a sign of alcohol dependence, drinking to excess brings serious health concerns, including heart and liver disease and liver cancer. 

According to a study published by Harvard in 2011, binge drinking was linked to increased risk of breast cancer for women.
