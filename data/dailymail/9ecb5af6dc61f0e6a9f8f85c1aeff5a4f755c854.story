Screened: Ayesha Niles, now 18, was arrested at Miami International Airport after allegedly trying to smuggle 30lbs of cocaine in her luggage

A British teenager is facing 15 years in prison after being caught smuggling 30lb of cocaine into America.

Ayesha Olivia Niles was picked out by customs officers at Miami Airport in Florida.

Agents found the packs of cocaine stuffed into 24 boxes of cake mix.

Niles, who turned 18 while being held in a juvenile detention centre, flew in from Jamaica last Friday.

In Florida, drug-traffickers can get sentenced to life in jail, which means a minimum tariff of 15 years.

Niles, a student from London, told police she did not know what she was carrying but suspected she was involved in illegal activity.

Police said the teen, who is from London, was picked for screening by customs agents.

As they searched her two suitcases they found the class A drug hidden in the boxes of cake mix.

It is not known if Niles was planning to continue with the drugs back to London are drop them off in Florida.

A police source said: 'She is a classic drug mule who thought she could easily bring the drugs through an airport undetected.'

Prosecutors said Niles was a 'poster child' for how easily drug smugglers can corrupt young people.

'This young woman had her 18th birthday in a foreign jail, far from her home and her family, because she thought she could smuggle almost 30 pounds of cocaine through Miami,' said Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle.

'Sadly, she almost becomes a poster child for how easily the drug trade can corrupt our youth.'

Miami-Dade Police Major Charles 
Nanney said it was rare to find people transporting such a large amount 
of drugs at the airport, especially a young girl.

He said she was chosen to be searched
due to enhanced security screening at the airport, one of Amercaâ€™s 
busiest and gateway to the Caribbean islands.

Niles faces charges of trafficking cocaine and importation of a controlled substance.

She was arrested on October 21 and has been held at juvenile detention centre.
