Ten steps to climb: Dorothy Bradbury (above) was told she must swap her black sacks for a wheelie bin outside her home in Great Barr, Birmingham

A council was today branded 'shambolic' for using Google Street View to decide which homes should receive new wheelie bins in a controversial £65million scheme.

Birmingham City Council said images from the website were ‘useful’ in deciding which properties were suitable for the new-style bins, which are being introduced around the city.

But Perry Barr councillor Jon Hunt - a long-term opponent of the scheme - said the revelation was the latest ‘shambles’ to dog the initiative.

Great Barr resident Dorothy Bradbury, 79, was told she must swap her black sacks for a wheelie bin, despite having to negotiate ten steps to leave her rubbish outside her home.

Claiming Google pictures of her home failed to show the steps and the slope on which it stands, she said: ‘I simply can’t drag two wheelie bins up ten steps to my home.

‘It is impossible. I would injure myself and end up in hospital. I am saying “no” to the council - I am not having wheelie bins. They can keep their hands off my sacks.’

Details of her case emerged as letters went out in the areas of Sutton Coldfield, Erdington and Perry Barr, telling households if they were to receive wheelie bins.

Liberal Democrat councillor Mr Hunt said he had tried and failed to drag a wheelie bin up Ms Bradbury's steps, adding that many properties in the area were on steep slopes and unsuitable for wheelie bins.

Mr Hunt said: ‘The council has blown £65million on this project and is pouring out propaganda. Yet it cannot even promise to send officers round to walk the streets and look at properties.

‘When you compared what Google Street View shows with what you see at street level, you can see the crass incompetence of relying on Street View in an area as hilly as Great Barr.’

Residents can appeal against the imposition of a bin but Mr Hunt said that was not obvious on letters they received.

‘This is the all too predictable shambles I have been warning about for two years,’ he said. ‘The council has refused to listen to these warnings and pushed on.’

Suitable: Wheelie bins will be delivered to north Birmingham homes in time for collections to begin in June

Around 95 per cent of Birmingham homes have been rated suitable for wheelie bins. The others, such as blocks of flats, will continue with their current arrangements.

Assistant director of bins Kevin Mitchell defended the use of Google, saying it was ‘helpful’.

He said: ‘I get people with front gardens the size of football pitches saying they haven’t got room for two wheelie bins. I can look at a picture on Google and I don’t need to go round there.’

But Mr Mitchell said that, in marginal cases where residents appealed, officials would take a closer look in person. ‘We will go round and make an assessment,’ he added.
