Masters champion Adam Scott opened his defence here at Augusta National on Thursday like a man with no intention of letting anyone rip the jacket off his back.

All year the pride he felt in becoming the first Australian to win  here was obvious, as he took the green coat — to use the American vernacular — on a world tour  that culminated in a glorious  homecoming Down Under last November.

Scott has inspired his Australian peers to such an extent that they have won four of the last seven

Job well done: Adam Scott looks happy after completing round one, finishing just one shot back

Great start: But American Bill Haas leads the way, with a round of 68 at Augusta

Respect: Haas was playing with Miguel Angel Jimenez at the Masters, and both played well

Now
 the main man is back, as  he posted an impressive three-under-par 69 
that left him just a stroke off the lead held by  American Bill Haas.

‘I
 don’t know how it felt to him but to me it looked like he had the ball 
on a string,’ said Scott’s  playing partner, England’s US  Amateur 
champion Matt Fitzpatrick. ‘He’s got such a  fantastic swing, it was a 
pleasure watching him.’

The
 only other player who draws compliments like this from fellow 
competitors is Rory McIlroy. All those hoping for the pair to be locked 
together come the final nine holes on Sunday will have been encouraged 
by the sight of the Northern Irishman also taking his place on the 
leaderboard.

The 24-year-old finished with a 71, which represented a good start on a devilishly difficult opening day.

As
 so often this season, his  driving was a thing of beauty but  34 putts 
told its own story of a round that was stunted by his work on the 
greens.

Still, the daunting 
nature of the set-up was illustrated by the fact only four players broke
 70, with Bubba Watson and Louis Oosthuizen, the two men who contested 
the play-off in 2012, finishing alongside Scott.

Watson, the winner on that occasion two years ago, was the only player in the 97-man field to keep a bogey off his card.

McIlroy
 began by booming drives on the opening three holes that all came to 
rest 320 yards from the tee on their respective fairways.

Hanging in there: Rory McIlroy is well in contention on one under par

GARY PLAYER (@garyplayer):  ‘An honour to kick off @The_Masters with Jack & Arnie. Only 1 shot. Counting on blasting it long & straight.’

The South African veteran joined Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer to hit the honorary tee shot.

TIGER WOODS (@TigerWoods): 'It never gets old watching the honorary starters tee off. One of the oldest and best traditions in the game.'

The injured world No 1 had to watch from the sidelines as this year's tournament got under way.

GRAEME McDOWELL (Graeme_McDowell): 'Not breaking us in gently with Day One pin positions here @The_Masters. Some tough ones especially 5/10/16.'

The Northern Irishman was spot on with his predictions and faced a struggle before finishing level par for the day.

SHANE WARNE (@warne888):
 The Masters starts today! Good luck to all the players, especially the 
Aussies, maybe back to back Scotty? My tip is @JDayGolf!'

Former Australian spinner Warne was backing his fellow countryman Jason Day to follow up Adam Scott's win last year.

EOIN MORGAN (@Eoin16): Made all my bets for live Masters. I've spread the love this year backing Rory, Bubba and Keegan Bradley.

The England batsman will be hoping his tips perform better than his cricket team have done recently.

GARETH BALE (@GarethBale11): ‘It’s Masters time! One of my favourite sporting events. Backing @DJohnsonPGA to win it this year’

The Real Madrid star backed American Dustin Johnson, but fellow Welshman Ian Woosnam finished on five over.

Decent support: Girlfriend and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki was following the Northern Irishman

Could have been better: It was still a mixed day for McIllroy

At the 
par-four third, that left him just a pitch on to the green and he duly 
knocked it close to set up his first birdie. Another followed at the 
fifth but then came bogeys at the eighth and 12th.

He
 found the green in two on both the par fives on the back nine to set up
 birdies but a three-putt at the 18th stung. Still, as he reflected: 
‘This was a day when the course was set up so hard any score under par 
represented a good start.’

McIlroy
 thought the test a little different from the past, but the familiarity 
of the names at the top of the leaderboard suggested otherwise.

After
 the monsoon on Monday and unseasonably chilly weather to follow, dawn 
broke on Masters Thursday to a Georgia peach of a day. The opportunity 
was clearly there to post a score and make a statement but the pin 
positions on the first day are usually brutal and here was no exception.

Much of the interest  surrounded McIlroy and Scott, of course, who were out in successive groups.

Scott
 made a spectacular start. A pushed drive at the first left  him with 
only a narrow opening to squeeze his approach through if he was to find 
the green.

Fearless: Scott was showing no signs of nerves as he looked to defend his Masters jacket

Uh-oh: The Australian had to take a drop at the Par 5 15th

What a lesson: Amateur playing partner Matt Fitzpatrick said it was a pleasure to watch Scott's swing

He did that all 
right, provoking one of the loudest cheers of the early play when the 
ball pitched six feet from the hole and pulled up half that distance 
away.

Having achieved one 
unlikely birdie, Scott managed another at the short sixth, where the 
hole was positioned on a treacherous ledge. A more customary birdie for a
 man with his prodigious gifts off the tee followed at the long eighth 
to take him out in a tidy 33 strokes.

A
 birdie at the 10th — the hole he also birdied last year to break  the 
Aussie curse in the play-off against Angel Cabrera — took him to four 
under.

The 12th hole at 
Augusta is the shortest on the course, known as Golden Bell, and how 
often it has tolled for players who appear to be moving through the 
gears.

On this day the flag
 was located on the right, always the most dangerous spot. Never go for 
this flag, advises Jack Nicklaus, but Scott gambled — and lost. His 
ball  finished in the water and he failed to hole from six feet for a 
bogey.

Mixed emotions: Brandt Snedeker lead at one stage before finishing on two under, just like Jimmy Walker

Still going strong: Fred Couples impressed beyond his years

Scott also 
three-putted the long 13th for a disappointing par, before birdieing the
 14th to continue his curious round where he birdied the holes you’re 
supposed to par and parred the holes that offer obvious opportunities. 
‘It showed how well I was playing that I only birdied one of the par 
fives and yet still shot 69,’ he said.

Seven
 players shot 70, including Americans Brandt Snedeker and Jimmy Walker, 
while alongside McIlroy on 71 was 54-year-old Fred Couples. Evergreen is
 exactly the right word to describe him given that every time he puts on
 that green jacket and walks through the gates of Magnolia Lane, he 
turns into a golfing Peter Pan. Couples hasn’t finished outside the top 
15 since turning 50, a truly remarkable statistic.

Scotland’s
 Stephen Gallacher  finished on the same mark while Graeme McDowell shot
 a respectable 72 — a score matched by the indefatigable Bernhard 
Langer, now 56 — but for England’s finest it was another frustrating 
day.

Shining light: The Englishman struggled on day one, only Westwood really impressing

Struggled: Luke Donald (left) and Justin Rose had a horrific day with the tricky tee positions

Luke Donald found 
insult added to injury when he was assessed a two-shot penalty at the 
ninth for touching the sand with his club in a bunker before he hit the 
ball to turn a poor 77 into a desperate 79, while Justin Rose and Ian 
Poulter shot 76s.

It was a 
popular score among the English contingent with the two amateurs 
competing, Fitzpatrick and Garrick Porteous, on the same mark. In this 
company, last man out Lee Westwood’s 73 was a  positive beacon.

Course specialist Phil Mickelson needs a low one as well on Friday after also shooting 76.

Got a chance: Augusta regulars Louis Oosthuizen (above) and Bubba Watson are right in the mix

What
 of the two Stadlers, Kevin and Craig, the first father and son to play 
in the same Masters? Kevin, on his debut, shot a fine 70. His dad was 
surely delighted with that? If he was, he kept it well hidden.

Did you watch Kevin tee off, he was asked. ‘No,’ came the reply.

He did pretty well today? ‘I’ve no idea what he shot.’

Two under.

‘Did he? Good.’

Craig Stadler, it hardly needs  saying, went round in 82. Wouldn’t you think he’d have swallowed his own disappointment?
