Win, lose or draw true England fans will NEVER give up on their country, and I am one of those. You know the away fans’ views can always be trusted – these are the hardcore supporters.

These guys take time off work and pay fortunes to follow England everywhere – with little reward on the pitch, and lately no reward off the pitch from the Football Association with it’s scandalous double points for Wembley loyalty scheme.

The England fans in Basle on Monday made their feelings clear about that situation with some loud and lively songs directed towards the FA. The last thing Roy Hodgson and his players need is negativity from the fans, but their anger is fully justified after this diabolical decision penalizing loyalty. The FA should scrap it before the policy does some serious damage to the relationship between England and the loyal fans.

Soaking up the atmosphere: Fans gather at the Hat-Trick bar in Basle before the game 

Wurst and non-alcoholic beer were on the menu at the Hat-Trick Bar at the stadium before the game, Swiss fans decked in red were optimistic after what they considered to be a decent tournament in Brazil.

England fans were calm, and most were hopeful of a draw at best.

My pessimism evaporated on hearing the team news: Fabian Delph, Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling had more than a whiff of four-diamond-two about it and so it proved.

It’s the system I’ve been desperate for England to play since Sterling burst onto the scene. We’ve got enough strikers now to play two up front so let’s stick with this system please Roy.

England fans got in the ground early as always, and draped banners everywhere. The total myth that it is only lower division clubs’ fans who follow England was smashed to pieces as I saw flags from Manchester United, Sunderland and Newcastle hung up early on.

Pride and passion: England fans show their support for Roy Hodgson's side during the win over Switzerland

Joe Hart received a rapturous welcome when he emerged for the warm up. And then the rest of the players came out to a great ovation.

Standing in amongst those fans it was hard to believe England had gone out of the World Cup in record time. It was even harder to believe that there was any kind of anti-Hodgson feeling among these fans as they sang his name on more than one occasion during the match.

From within that England section of the ground, doubts were raised about both full-backs, especially Leighton Baines. And one Yorkshireman behind me stunned me by saying Jordan Henderson had ‘done nothing.’ He and his mates celebrated England’s first goal by stripping to the waist. Classic Brits abroad!

A semi-drunk bloke in front of me who ate three sausages during the game – believe me it was no fun sitting behind this guy – had his head in his hands as Danny Welbeck’s final ball in after a brilliant run came to nothing.

Favourites among the England crowd at the game were Hart – ‘England’s number one’; Sterling, who is clearly the kind of player these fans have been waiting to see wear the Three Lions for a very long time; and Wayne Rooney. The England captain got the biggest cheer for the Norway game in midweek, and again when his name was read out in Basel, the fans saved their top volume for him.

Some think Rooney is past his best. You won’t find many of those hardcore England fans in Switzerland agreeing with that. He may not have got on the scoresheet but he led by example, defending from the front, and playing a part in the goal to break the deadlock. And it might have been missed on TV but there were several moments in the game when the skipper offered encouragement to individuals. He’s a better captain than the sceptics realise.

Backing: England fans sang Roy Hodgson's name during the game and were behind the manager 

Some songs – particularly any referring to the IRA – didn’t belong at a football match. Others, especially the one strongly encouraging Scots to vote for independence, were hilarious. The national anthem got several airings as the evening went on.

But the loudest singing was saved for Danny Welbeck. His second goal meant England fans could relax, sing loud and thoroughly enjoy their night.

The trams outside the stadium were literally rocking as England fans celebrated.

Winning away is one of the best feelings whether it is your club or your country. The atmosphere was fantastic among the England fans – unthreatening and positive.

Despite the massive disappointment of the summer, Hodgson received total support from the travelling England support in Basle. And his system, his gameplan, and his players won the game to reward those England fans.

It’s just a qualifier, but it’s our toughest qualifier against a team that went further than we did at the World Cup, and who are above us in the rankings. I was at their World Cup tie in Sao Paolo when for 118 minutes the Swiss organised themselves superbly to keep Messi and co at bay. So to go there and win 2-0 is a huge result for Hodgson.

Leader: Wayne Rooney took on the responsibility of being England captain very well

Job wel done: Welbeck celebrates infront of the England fans after the 2-0 win

It was great to see England play as a team, brilliant to see them win, and fantastic to see the players come over to us at the end of the game with smiles on their faces.

Hart slapping his England badge was enough to show me that these players have got passion playing for their country.

My advice to those whose tolerance has almost peaked with England is this: I understand the frustration. But never give up on your country.

There are exciting and re-energised players in the England team. And when Roy gets it right as he did in Basle, it’s a brilliant feeling.

They sent us home victorious.

We were happy, it was glorious.
