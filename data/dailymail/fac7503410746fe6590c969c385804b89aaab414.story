Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer has accused embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's office of linking Superstorm Sandy aid to development and threatening to deny the link if it was made public.

Ms Zimmer told CNN's Anderson Cooper that New Jersey Liutenant Governor Kim Guadagno told her that aid would be withheld if development stalled, that it was a direct message from Christie and that any attempts to make the conversation public would be refuted.

'The lieutenant governor [Kim Guadagno] pulled me aside and said, essentially, 'You've got to move forward with the Rockefeller project. This project is really important to the governor,' Mayor Zimmer recalled during Monday night the interview.

'I know these things should not be connected, but they are, and if you tell anyone I said they are I will deny it,' Ms Zimmer recalled Ms Guadagno saying last May.

The lieutenant governor was in Hoboken after a series of letters exchanged between Ms Zimmer and Mr Christie that left her under the impression that failing to move forward with the now-infamous Rockefeller project would result any chances of Sandy aid coming to Hoboken.

Ms Guadagno held a press conference Monday to counter the claims.

'I deny any suggestion made by Mayor Zimmer that there was ever any condition on the release of Sandy funds by me,' she said, according to USA Today.

She also accused Sandy aid administrator Marc Ferzan of repeating the threat when she asked him about the aid.

'Mayor, you need to tell us the level of development you’re willing to do,' she recalled him telling her.

When asked why she waited until now to make these accusations public, Ms Zimmer said she was afraid it would hurt Hoboken's already dwindling chances of receiving any further aid.

The revelation the governor's office said they would deny the 
conversation ever took place comes after a weekend in which the letters 
were released to multiple media outlets and it became apparent the probe into alleged corruption is rapidly expanding.

'As they pursue this investigation, I 
will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the 
facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to Hoboken and 
told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward with a 
private development project,' she said in statement released over the weekend.

She told CNN Sunday that it was 
'stunning' and 'outrageous,' but true, that Lieutenant Governor Kim 
Guadagno approached her in a parking lot in May to deliver the threat, 
stating that it was 'a direct message from the Governor.'

'I stand by my word,' she told CNN's Candy Crowley.

Democratic
 New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski says he will expand an existing 
investigation into Zimmer's allegations. He's already investigating 
traffic jams at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, 
allegedly orchestrated by Christie aides as political payback.

The
 damning accusations, which Christie's administration vehemently denies,
 came as the Governor left his 'bridge-gate' troubles behind and flew to
 Florida to campaign for a fellow Republican.

'The bottom line is, it's not fair for 
the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because
 he wants me to give back to one private developer,' she told MSNBC.

Sandy devastated nearly 80 per cent of Hoboken in 2012, and Christie had immediately promised its residents that he would 'be here to help'.

But when Zimmer requested $127million in relief aid, she was given just $142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator, and $200,000 in recovery grants from a $1.8 million fund, MSNBC reported.

In a letter written to Christie about the low funds, Zimmer wrote: 'Please 
governor, we need 
your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be 
treated fairly.'

No written response was received to the letter dated May 8, 2013 - the same day the city's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for The Rockefeller Group.

But Ms Guadagno supposedly made her remarks to Ms Zimmer on May 10, she told CNN.

According to emails, public records and her diary entries, Zimmer claims Christie's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor-backed plans.

The project, a mass redevelopment proposed by the Rockefeller Group, was already in the pipeline when Zimmer was elected as mayor.

The lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies.

Zimmer told MSNBC she wasn't against the plan, but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place.

But when the study and Hoboken board rejected the need for redevelopment, much-needed Sandy relief money was cut off, Zimmer claims.

Then, in a diary entry for May 17, Zimmer claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the Sandy recovery, Commissioner Constable leaned in and told her 'Everyone in the State House believes you are against [the Rockefeller project].'

Zimmer denied she was against it, but Commissioner Constable then allegedly told her: 'If you move that forward, the money would start flowing to 
you.'

'Pressure': Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno allegedly told Mayor Zimmer if she didn't move forward with the project, the administration would not be able to help her

Spokesmen for Governor Christie and community affairs commissioner Constable have denied the allegations.

A spokeswoman for the commissioner said: 'Mayor Zimmer's 
allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned 
Hoboken's receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development 
project is categorically false.'

The Governor's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, released a statement that read: 'Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governor's Office and the assistance we've provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid.'

'What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone's guess.'

When asked by Mr Cooper if the Democratic National Committee was involved in her Sandy Aid onslaught against the governor, Ms Zimmer categorically denied having any contact with the organization.

'They haven’t called me at all, I have no connection to them,' she said.

A spokesman for the Rockefellar Group said: 'We 
have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If 
it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.'

Despite the 'bridge-gate' scandal, many Republicans have come to Governor Christie's defense and praised him for taking action.

Others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate.
