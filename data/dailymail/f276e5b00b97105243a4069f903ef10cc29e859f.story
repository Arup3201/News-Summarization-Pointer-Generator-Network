Face masked by bandages, she is the tiny victim of a brutal massacre.

Now, lying in a makeshift bed, she pleads with Allah to punish the men who killed her brother and may cost her her sight.

The child, believed to be about five, was one of scores of civilians to be injured during the bombing of the rebel city of Homs by Syrian government troops yesterday.

A video which surfaced online appears to show her being carried through the streets by her distraught father.

She was treated for her injuries - including a leg wound too horrific to show - but it is unclear what hope she has of recovery.

Speaking from her bed today, she said: 'God is greater than you Bashar (the Syrian president). May God deprive you of your children like you deprived me of my brother. What did we do that made you do this to us?'

Today, as Syrian forces continued to bombard Homs with shells raining down every 30 seconds, Britain and America both withdrew their ambassadors from the city of Damascus.

In a statement to the House of Commons, William Hague said that he had also summoned the Syrian ambassador in London to the Foreign Office to make clear its 'abhorrence' at the violence in the country.

He condemned President Bashar Assad's 'doomed' and 'murdering' regime and was highly critical of China and Russia for vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution aimed at ending the bloodshed.

Mr Hague said their actions were a 'betrayal of the Syrian people' and increased the likelihood of civil war.

'The human suffering in Syria is already unimaginable and is in grave danger of escalating further,' he said. He confirmed that the British ambassador Simon Collins has been withdrawn.

'We will use our remaining channels to the Syrian regime to make clear our abhorrence at the violence that is utterly unacceptable to the civilised world,' he went on.

'The position taken by Russia and China has regrettably made this more likely.

'However this Government, this House, and our country and our allies will not forget the people of Syria.

'We will redouble our efforts to put pressure on this appalling regime and to stop this indefensible violence.'

Russia and China were the only two nations on the 15-strong Security Council to vote against the Arab League-backed resolution.

Mr Hague said: 'They chose to side with the Syrian regime and implicitly to leave the door open to further abuses by them.

'They did so while President Assad's 
tanks were encircling Homs and shells were pounding the homes of Syrian 
civilians, killing up to 200 people, and on the 30th anniversary of the 
massacre in Hama.

'We regard this veto as a grave error of judgment by the governments of China and Russia.

'There is no need to mince words 
about this. Russia and China have twice vetoed reasonable and necessary 
action by the United Nations Security Council.

'Such vetoes are a betrayal of the 
Syrian people. In deploying them, they have let down the Arab League, 
they have increased the likelihood of what they wish to avoid in Syria -
 civil war - and they have placed themselves on the wrong side of Arab 
and international opinion.'

Mr Hague said that Britain and other 
nations would consider a resolution at the UN General Assembly, in the 
absence of a UN Security Council resolution.

As diplomatic pressure intensified, Syrian forces continued to bombard Homs with shells, raining down every 30 seconds.

The attack, which residents claim is 
aimed at a makeshift hospital run by anti-government forces, has not 
lapsed since it began at 6am local time.

Activists inside Syria claim that more than 50 people have been killed. 

Helicopters and tanks are also attacking Homs, leading residents to fear an 'imminent' ground invasion by government forces.

A British national who has gone to the country to provide humanitarian aid said that the situation is desperate.

Speaking to ITV news from the makeshift hospital 
in Homs, he said that bodies were being brought in in pieces because 
they had been hit by heavy artillery. He said many were unrecognisable.

The international community continued
 to condemn Syria's actions with the U.S. government closing its embassy
 in Damascus and pulling all its diplomats out.

The mood inside the city is that a 
final showdown is just hours away. One anti-government protester, known 
only as Omar, told the BBC: 'This battle will be the last battle.'

The bloodshed comes one day after 
President Assad's government vowed to continue its crackdown on 
the nearly 11-month-old uprising.

It comes two days after another heavy
 bombardment that claimed the lives of more than 200 people in a single 
day, the deadliest incident of the uprising so far.

As many as 300 people have been killed in Homs over the weekend.

The regime of President Bashar el-Assad denied any bombardment took place.

William Hague yesterday warned Russia
 and China that the blood of Syrian protesters will be on their hands 
for failing to stand up to the ‘murdering’ regime.

The Foreign Secretary could not 
conceal his anger following their decision to veto a UN resolution 
calling for al-Assad's resignation.

He said Moscow and Beijing would be 
‘held responsible’ for what happens in Syria and that he could not 
understand their support for a ‘doomed regime as well as a murdering 
regime’. He warned the veto marked ‘an hour of shame’ for the UN.

His remarks were echoed by U.S. 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said the veto was a ‘travesty’ 
and called for the ‘friends of democratic Syria’ to unite against 
al-Assad.

Human rights groups say at least 7,000 people have died since the uprising began in March.

A draft resolution condemning Syria was supported by 13 of the 15 UN 
Security Council members when it was put to a vote on Saturday, meaning 
it was not adopted.

It was the second time in four months that Russia has obstructed a resolution condemning Syria.
Mr Hague said yesterday: ‘Increasingly, Russia and China will be held responsible for this continuing appalling situation.

‘They are standing in the way of the 
UN Security Council taking a clear position, backing a very good plan 
for the way forward by the Arab League. It will have consequences for 
their influence in the Middle East. They are turning their backs on the 
Arab world.

‘Russia and China are very isolated in the indefensible position they have taken up.’

The Foreign Secretary also warned 
that al-Assad could step up his reprisals against anti-government 
protesters. ‘Will he have been emboldened by the fact that Russia and 
China vetoed the resolution?’ he said.

‘Yes, I think so and I think it does 
mean that Russia and China do bear increasingly, as these events 
continue, increased responsibility for what is happening.’

Mrs Clinton, on a visit to the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, this weekend, echoed Mr Hague’s comments.
‘What happened at the United Nations was a travesty,’ she said.

‘We will work to expose those who are
 still funding the regime and sending it weapons to be used against 
defenceless Syrians, including women and children.’

An Al Qaeda leader who allegedly masterminded the July 7, 2005  London bombings has reportedly been freed from a Syrian jail.

Abu Musab al-Suri, who is also wanted
 in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings, was apparently 
released in Aleppo, near the Turkish border, last week.

His release has been interpreted as a
 warning to the United States and Britain over their failure to support 
al-Assad during the Syrian uprisings.
