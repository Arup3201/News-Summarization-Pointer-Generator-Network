The sexts which led to an extortion sting and ultimately caused the downfall of a media executive who was hailed as one of the best in the business have been revealed.

Scott Sassa, 53, left his role as president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication group last month after explicit messages he exchanged with an escort were sent to his bosses.

It also emerged today that he is a longtime friend of the Kardashians and the mastermind behind The History Channel's recent hit show The Bible.

High-flyer: Mr Sassa, a single father-of-two, has worked in senior roles for other entertainment firms, including NBC and is a life-long friend of the Kardashians

Success: Sassa is also said to be the mastermind behind The History Channel's hit show The Bible

Sassa, who was responsible for the firm's interests in cable television networks, including ESPN and Lifetime, is alleged to have sent the texts to the LA-based stripper and arranged to meet up with her.

Colleagues of Sassa told Business Insider than he was alone in LA on Christmas day when the texts were sent and that this was uncharacteristic of him.

He tried to lure the woman, who has been named as 'Kira', to his Hollywood hotel with promises of MDMA, cocaine and sex.

He also offered her $1,000 for two hours work, according to Business Insider. 

He text her: 'Do you roll? Have great molly.'

'If okay lets do 2hrs $1000 and take molly.'

'With the molly and the white you are going to have the best time.'

'Molly' is a street name for MDMA and 'white' refers to cocaine.

He then text her: 'I'm going to lay you on your stomach and grab your breasts from behind. Will kiss you back slowly down your spine...'

'Kira' is believed to have sent Mr Sassa - who is a single father-of-two - revealing pictures of herself during the exchanges and asked if she should bring sex toys.

She then backs out of the deal, telling him her car broke down and she cannot come to his hotel.

Resigned: Scott Sassa, a senior executive at media firm Hearst, has left his job after explicit texts he allegedly sent to a stripper were seen by his bosses

When Kira's boyfriend saw the messages, he then allegedly tried to extort money from Sassa by   threatening to forward the messages to his bosses at Hearst unless he paid money.

The escort is alleged to have been a part of this extortion plot.

When he emailed the senior vice president of the company James M Asher, the boyfriend claimed to have a meeting with gossip website TMZ but promised he would hold off until they made an offer.

Asher decides to investigate the man's claims and asks for more information including the girl's name and details.

A few days later he emails the boyfriend back to say: 'While we cannot go into specifics, we have taken appropriate action as a result of the information you provided.'

It then emerged that Sassa - who has also held senior positions at Fox, NBC, Friendster and Marvel Entertainment - was forced to resign.

Among those thought to have received the messages were Hearst's CEO Frank Bennack Jr and Michael Clinton, president of marketing for the magazines.

Mr Sassa had previously enjoyed a successful career at NBC, which he joined in 1997 as president of the NBC Television Stations division and before that at Turner Broadcasting.

When reached for comment, Sassa said: 'I just want to put this business behind me.'
