This is the toe-curling moment a wealthy motorist surveyed the scene after his £180,000 sports car was struck by a runaway old banger.

The Aston Martin DBS was parked at a petrol station yesterday afternoon when the tiny pink Vauxhall Corsa lost control going round a roundabout and careered onto the garage forecourt.

It smashed into the 190mph DBS - a favourite of James Bond - as its owner stood filling it up, shunting it into a petrol pump.

Onlookers watched in horror as the little pink runabout crashed into the £100,000 Aston Martin yesterday

After the accident at Swindon's Kingshill Esso garage, the Aston Martin's owner, who asked not to be named, said the car was damaged beyond repair.

He said: 'I was filling up and then I saw the car coming towards me.

'She drove out of the petrol station onto the roundabout, lost it and came over the kerb and straight into my car.  My car moved into the pump and bumped the pump off.'

He told the Swindon Advertiser: 'My car will be a write-off.  They won't fix that.'

A passer-by, who saw the incident, said: 'She lost control on the roundabout and span around and into the petrol station.

'It all happened so fast in front of me.'

Paramedics and police attended but 
neither driver was hurt in the incident which happened just before 3pm. 
The petrol station was closed while staff worked to repair the damaged 
pump.

Hitting the road sign might have been cheaper: The pink Corsa hit the well-polished DBS squarely on its side

Shaken not stirred: Neither the owner of the Aston Martin nor the Corsa was injured in yesterday's accident

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'We were called at 2.55pm to reports of two cars colliding on the forecourt of the Esso petrol station.

'One of the cars had gone into a pump. There was no fire but there was a strong smell of fumes.'

Aston Martin sportscars have been featured in several James Bond films, with the DBS appearing as 007's car in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.

A spokesman for Aston Martin said: 'The DBS is not of the understated elegance of a DB9, nor the youthful agility of the V8 Vantage.

'It is explosive power in a black tie, and has its own unique character which will equal that of James Bond.'

When the Aston Martin DBS went on sale in 2007, prices started from £180,000, but the model was discontinued last year.

Powered by a 6-litre V12 engine, the 510bhp DBS is capable of 0-62mph in just 4.3 seconds, and boasts a top speed of 190mph.

In real life, James Bond actor Daniel Craig, who drove the DBS in Casino Royale, is a fan, too.  Earlier this month the star, who turned 45 on March 2, was pictured taking delivery of a bright red £150,000 Vantage Roadster, leaving neighbours wondering if the convertible Aston Martin was a present to himself.

Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson described the Aston Martin DBS as a model which is 'as close to perfect as a car can be'.
