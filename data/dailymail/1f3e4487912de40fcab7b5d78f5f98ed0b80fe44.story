Simon Bonnell was furious as he was turned away after being 10 minutes late

An unemployed man dumped 10kgs of dog poo in his local job centre after they refused to hand over his dole money because he was 10 minutes late to sign on.

Simon Bonnell, 21, from Berry Hill in Stoke-on-Trent, made the protest in anger at the way staff at the Job Centre Plus treated him after he was late for an appointment to sign on.

He has since been banned from the building in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, for three months, meaning he will lose out on £600 in Jobseekers' Allowance.

A court heard Bonnell arrived late for the appointment on December 6 last year and was told he would need to speak to an adviser over the telephone.

He then went back home where he filled a bin liner with dog mess collected from a nearby park before returning to the centre and dumping the contents in the foyer.

Bonnell had so much faeces in the bag that he had to stop half way back to the centre for a rest because of the weight, the court was told.

Staff soon identified him from CCTV footage and following his arrest pleaded guilty to criminal damage.

As well as not being able to claim jobseekers' allowance for three months, JPs fined Bonnell £200 and ordered him to pay £63.60 to cover the cost of industrially cleaning the carpet.

Simon Oldham, defending, told the court: 'It was an extremely silly incident and the defendant accepts it was a stupid thing to do and is extremely sorry.

'He apologises to both the job centre and the court.

'He went to sign on and was late so he had to have a telephone interview and was upset by how he was treated.

'He accepts this was no way to deal with it.'

But Bonnell insisted he had no regrets about his actions.

He said: "The staff spoke to me like I was dirt and said they would stop my money.

'I was angry when I was on the telephone but there was a baby next to me and so I didn't swear.

'Looking back I was glad I did what I did at the time. I just felt so mad.

'I just want to get a job as I don't want to be on the dole.'

The Department for Work and Pensions confirmed Bonnell would be eligible to re-register with the Job Centre in March.
