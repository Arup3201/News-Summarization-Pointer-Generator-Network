Two schoolboys, aged 12 and 13, have appeared in court after they were charged with raping and assaulting a 43-year-old-woman.

The alleged attack happened at the woman's flat on September 24 last year in Anfield, Liverpool, in front of a group of other boys.

It led to the mass arrests of teenagers in the area, including 10 males aged 12 to 19 and a 15-year-old girl, but they were later released.

Two schoolboys, aged 12 and 13, appeared at Liverpool Youth Court today charged with the rape and assault of a 43-year-old woman in Anfield

The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at Liverpool Youth Court today for a first hearing.  

One is a 12-year-old from Anfield and the other a 13-year-old from Tuebrook.

The case was adjourned and they were given conditional bail to appear at Liverpool Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on March 17. 

Detective Superintendent Tim Keelan, from Merseyside police, said at the time of the attack: 'The victim has been distressed by her ordeal and is being supported by specialist officers.

'This was an appalling attack on a woman in her own home and we would urge anyone who has information, which could help us bring those responsible to justice, to come forward.

'It is possible that some of those who were in the property on the day may have talked to people, including friends or family, about what happened and if they have we would urge them to contact us.'
