IKEA has been forced to recall two junior beds after several reports of a broken metal rods  which expose sharp edges and could injure a sleeping child.

The leading furniture chain issued the recall across the world after a number of the beds had suffered the fault.

The concerned models are called Kritter and Sniglar, and over 10,000 beds have been sold in Sweden alone.

The recall, announced by IKEA on its national websites, concerned several countries including its native Sweden and Britain.

Other countries affected are Belgium, China, Czech Republic, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Switzerland, Thailand and Turkey.

To avoid children cutting themselves on the sharp edges, customers can return the bed, exchange it at the store or pick up a free repair kit, IKEA said.

Anna Pilkrona Godden, Swedish spokesperson for IKEA said about 10,000 beds of the two models had been sold in the Scandinavian country, but she was unable to specify how many beds had been sold abroad.
