Hospitals could be given more money from the Government if patients are happy with their care, according to the new NHS chief.

Simon Stevens said in future, a higher proportion of funding given to trusts would be based on patients’ views – as well as the quality of care given and the prevention of disease.

In a speech to the NHS Confederation Conference in Liverpool, he promised ‘far reaching changes in how hospitals and community services are funded’.

At present, hospitals are given more money from the NHS if they reach certain targets for providing good care – for example preventing falls and bedsores, and offering patients screening for dementia.

But Mr Stevens said he wanted a higher proportion of funding to be tied to patients’ overall experience of their time in hospital.

It is not yet clear if this would be assessed through surveys such as the recently introduced ‘friends and family test’.

Mr Stevens, 48, who is married with two children, took over from the beleaguered Sir David Nicholson in April.

Last week – in his first interview since taking up the position – he called for small district hospitals to play a greater role  in caring for the elderly closer to home. Speaking yesterday, he said: ‘We need to take a new look at incentives.

‘NHS England is currently expecting to spend up to £2.7billion on various performance incentives for community and acute providers [hospitals].

‘We will be undertaking a hardnosed review of how these various schemes are structured, and what we for the money.

‘More broadly, across all NHS-funded services, we’ll be pushing for a steadily increasing proportion of payments tied to performance, quality and outcomes.’

He also told delegates that the NHS should be at the ‘forefront’ of treating patients based on their genetic make-up.
