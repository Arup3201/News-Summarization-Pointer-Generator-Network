A photographer has captured stunning aerial images of mountain-tops and sprawling deserts across Iran, India and Pakistan, that look like images of distant planets seen from space.

Paul Williams, who is a director and producer for the BBC Natural History Unit, books window seats on airplanes especially for his hobby.

The 34-year-old from Rotherham, who has worked on a range of TV series including 'Britain Goes Wild', 'Life in Cold Blood', 'Life' and 'How Earth Made Us', travelled around the region capturing aerial shots of deserts, mountains and even sweeping fires.

BBC director and producer and part-time photographer Paul Williams has taken the stunning images of sprawling deserts across Iran, India and Pakistan - pictured is the Elberz Mountains in South Iran

Mr Williams said: 'I first read about the famous Salt Desert of Iran when I was a student 15 years ago, so when I realised that my recent flight back from Australia flew directly over this spectacular landscape I booked a window seat and hoped for a clear day.'

He was not disappointed, and decided to explore the spectacular views beneath him.Â 

Around 300 kilometres east-southeast of Tehran lies Iran Dasht-e Kavir, also known as the Great Salt Desert.

Mr Williams' remarkable photographs of the sprawling Salt Desert capture the beauty and detail of the landscape.

Mr Williams didn't only take pictures of the uninhabited areas, also capturing built up areas like north west India, where smoke can be seen rising from fires in the area

'Many of my images look like sliced onions or giant eyes, others look like racing tracks,' he said.

'From the air it is a mesmerising landscape of parallel and concentric lines which resemble the rings of Jupiter, on the ground it is one of the hottest and driest places on earth.'

Most would assume that the Great Salt Desert has been bone-dry since the beginning of time.

But experts believe that tens of millions of years ago a salt-rich ocean flowed through this area, surrounding a micro continent that is now central Iran.

This image seems more like a vivid painting or image from another planet, but instead it shows the mountains of south west Pakistan meets the coast of the Arabian sea at Ormara Tehsil

Mr Williams explains that the evaporation of the ocean left behind a layer of salt up to 7 kilometres thick.

Due to its low density as layers of younger rock buried the salt, it began to push upwards, shaping the younger rock into domes.

Mr Williams said: 'Wind and rain continue to wear away the top of the domes to expose them in cross-section, like slicing an onion, to reveal geological works of art that are particularly striking when seen from the air.'

He finds many interesting sights and objects within his photography and believes he stumbled across a mysterious base in the Salt Desert in Iran.

In this image of the desert in Iran, a base can be seen in the topmost corner of the picture - Williams believes this base could be unmarked or lost, due to the fact that it does not appear on any official records or maps in areas with the same coordinates

This image of the Kavir Desert in Iran looks more like an image of the planet Jupiter seen through a telescope, showing how otherworldly some desert areas can look from above

The images of the Kavir Desert were taken over the course of many trips, and are part of Williams' hobby, which is booking trips on planes going over the desert and taking pictures out of the window

The photographer said: 'One of my photos shows a road going straight across the patterns and another (in the top left hand corner) shows some sort of base in the desert, possibly military. I've found most of the sites on Google Earth and I have GPS coordinates but I can't find this base anywhere.'

He says he is certain, that based on the geology, rock markings, and the route of his plane that the coordinates on Google Maps are 34.935538, 54.436137.

But Google Maps do not appear to show the base he uncovered in his photograph

Pail Williams, 34, has produced and directed many BBC travel documentaries and has been working on these images as a hobby for years - booking passage on planes in order to take his pictures

Mr Williams also travelled to South Iran to photograph the snow-coated Elburz Mountains.

He captured a particularly striking photo with a clear line marking where the snow begins, and similarly to the Salt Desert, the magic of the Elburz Mountains lies in their exquisite detail.

The white snow trickling down the dusty-pink mountain creates a pattern similar to the structure of veins.

His aerial shots of the rocky, mountains in South Pakistan show exposed layers of an anticline and ancient folded rock formed by mountain building processes.
