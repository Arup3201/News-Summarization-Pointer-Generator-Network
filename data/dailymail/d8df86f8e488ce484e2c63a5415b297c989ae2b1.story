In 2010 Sister Christine campaigned to have anti-Christmas posters put up in the area by Muslim radicals removed

A nun has torn down a black and white flag similar to one championed by Muslim extremists from the gates of a London housing estate and branded those who hoisted it up as 'naive young hotheads'.

The emblem was hung alongside the Palestinian flag in Poplar, Tower Hamlets, three days ago as part of a 'end the siege in Gaza' campaign. 

Sister Christine Frost, 77, a nun who works at a nearby church, said she asked some friends to help take the flag down early this morning using a stepladder out of fear it could be seen as 'aggressive' or 'insensitive'. 

Anti-extremist campaigners said the raising of the black flag was a 'provocative' act and undermined legitimate anger about the crisis in Palestine. 

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon called it 'extremely inappropriate'.

But the Roman Catholic nun, who has worked helping the elderly in the area for the last 40 years, denied the flag was put up to show support for radical jihadists.

Speaking yards from the gate today outside St Matthias Church, she insisted there was not any anti-Semitic sentiment on the estate and said the 'issue has been taken out of proportion.'

'There's no way they would have thought it was to do with ISIS,' she said.

'I couldn't believe it had been up for two weeks. I believe it means 'There is no other God but Allah. 

'The problem is that it has been adopted by ISIS.

'It's as ridiculous as saying the St George's Cross is a symbol of the BNP.

'It's exactly like with the Union Jack and the BNP supporters. It's nothing to do with being British. They're just young hot heads, naive.

'I'm Irish and its as ridiculous as saying that I represent the IRA.'

Sister Christine, who in 2010 campaigned to have anti-Christmas posters put up in the area by Muslim radicals removed, continued: 'The issue is aggression and insensitivity. It could be seen to be aggressive.

'I'm not sure that if I put up a Christian flag it wouldn't be upsetting to some people.'

It is not clear who raised the flag on the Will Crooks Estate - named after the  noted Victorian-era anti-poverty campaigner and then Labour MP - but it has caused offence.

The emblem was hung alongside the Palestinian flag in Poplar, Tower Hamlets, as part of a 'end the siege in Gaza' campaign

Scotland Yard sent officers to the estate this morning, although flying a flag of this sort is not illegal in Britain. 

The black and white flag has the Shahadatayn - the declaration of faith that all Muslims say - written on it, which translates as 'There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God'.

But in recent years versions have been hijacked by extremist supporters of the Taliban, Hamas, al-Shabaab, Al Qaeda and ISIS. 

A local resident, Nijam Miah, 57, said: 'They're young boys who dont know what they're doing. They have hot blood and they're playing with fire.'

One man who objected to it says he was confronted by a gang of youths who asked him: 'Are you a Jew?'.

When he said: 'Would it make a difference?' they responded: 'Yes it f****** would', according to the Guardian. 

Patrol: Police have been walking the Will Crooks Estate to calm any tensions. It is not clear who raised the flag on the Will Crooks Estate - named after the noted Victorian-era anti-poverty campaigner and then Labour MP - but it has caused offence

Gone: The local council today visited to remove the black flag hoisted above this Palestinian flag, but it was already gone - taken down by Sister Christine 

Mystery: A gang of youths are said to have confronted someone who complained about the flag and asked him: 'Are you a Jew?'

As news spread across the estate, Muslim men spilling out of a nearby Mosque rounded on reporters as they spoke to residents about their view on the inflammatory gesture.

The group's anger was directed at reports that terrorist-sympathisers had raised the flag similar in style to that used by terror group Isis alongside Palestinian flags. 

The five journalists said they were threatened by some in the group of Asian men aged between late teens and early forties. 

Snatching one reporter's notepad a man who had a young boy with him said: 'You better leave here before we do something to you. Go now, we don't want you around here.'

Two locals stepped in to calm the men down and one said: 'The people who caused these problems will be explaining themselves.

'It has caused us a lot of trouble, it has made us all look like violent terrorists.

'But the message on that flag and another here now are very similar, they just look different.

'They are just Islamic slogans that are used by all Muslims in praise of Allah.'

Speaking outside his flat where a large Palestinian flag hung from a bamboo cane student Mohammad Rasheduzzaman, 25, said: 'I'm protesting for Gaza, they're humans not animals.

'All the people here support Gaza. Muslim and Christians are a family on this estate, we are protesting against Israel.

'Some people call it a jihadi flag or a terrorism flag. It's not, it's just a sign of Islam. It says there is no god but Allah. 

Sunni Muslim Faisal Islam, 44, lives with his wife and five children on the estate.

The shop worker said: 'Until now there has never been a show of any anger, but I think it has been below the surface. 

'There is a big Muslim community here, who are all angry about what is happening in Gaza. I'm happy to support that.

'But putting up a flag could cause us trouble, it will give Sunnis a bad reputation.

'It might cause trouble between people here on the estate or it will encourage bad people to come here from somewhere else 

'This is generally a safe place for them, we don't want extreme people talking to our kids'.  

Controversial: Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman raised the Palestinian flag outside his headquarters but Jewish leaders told him to concentrate on 'potholes and bins'

Counter-terrorism think tank the Quilliam Foundation has called the decision to raise the flag 'provocative' and 'worrying'.

A spokesman said: 'This is not the flag of the so-called Islamic State (formerly ISIS), but the black flag with the shahadatayn (Muslim declarations of faith) written in white is known as the rayah, a symbol that has been adopted by Islamists in the last 25 years. Since the Bosnian conflict, it has been increasingly adopted by jihadist organisations.

'It is a provocative move by those who have put up the flag as they will well know its significance.

'Many geopolitical conflicts and humanitarian crises in the Middle East get adopted as 'Muslim causes' and subsequently get manipulated by myopic Islamist narratives.

'It is worrying that legitimate grievances surrounding Gaza and the plight of the Palestinian people are combined with jihadist symbols'.

Tower Hamlets Council has admitted it received complaints about the flag but when they arrived to pull it down it was already gone. 

A council spokesman said: 'The council can confirm that following reports this morning of a flag erected on the Will Crooks Estate, council officials took steps to remove it but found it had already been taken down by Sister Christine Frost, a well-known local activist and promoter of community cohesion. The flag was removed following concerns that it could cause community tension.

'The council welcomes the removal of this flag. We have consistently demonstrated that there is no place for hate in Tower Hamlets, whatever form it takes. We take decisive action to ensure people's actions do not affect the strong community cohesion that underpins Tower Hamlets. 

'This borough's community is proud to act as One Tower Hamlets and the council and its partners will always act to preserve and promote this united spirit, including removing any unauthorised flag on public space.'

The council's controversial mayor Lutfur Rahman sparked a storm of protest last month to after raising the Palestinian flag over the town hall 'in solidarity with Gaza'.

Mr Rahman ordered the flag to fly 'in support of a ceasefire and peace'.

Jewish leaders condemned the move as 'destructive' for community relations as local residents said the council should concentrate on 'potholes and bins' and not international conflicts.

Pro-Palestine supporters also blocked the nearby Blackwall Tunnel, waved flags and yelled slogans in a protest days later.
