A little girl left critically injured in a car crash was today told the heartbreaking news that her big sister died in the accident.

Megan McGrady, five, was left unconscious after the smash which claimed the life of her sister Sadie, six, who she was devoted to.

The girls’ grieving parents have kept a round-the-clock vigil at Megan’s bedside while she lay in intensive care.

The youngster came around three days later and started asking for her sister when her parents had to break it to her that Sadie had died in the crash.

Their grandfather John McGrady, 62, said: 'It is heartbreaking - the two girls were inseparable.

'They were always together in the house or if they went out together. Always together, always playing.'

The sisters were in the back of the family car when it was in a head-on crash near the family home in Mostyn, North Wales last Sunday.

Their parents Kate Barlow, 34, who was driving, and John Paul McGrady, 39, escaped without serious injury.

But 'little angel' Sadie died at the scene and 'critically injured' Megan was airlifted to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool.

Grandfather Mr McGrady said: 'She wasn’t conscious when she got to hospital - she was in intensive care but they’ve moved her out of there now.

'I have spoken to John Paul and said Megan woke last night and cried, asking for her sister.

'She is sitting up in bed now - I think they have explained to her.'

Mrs McGrady and her husband, a wind turbine technician, have been at Alder Hey with their surviving daughter since the crash.

Mr McGrady said: 'Sadie’s gone but Megan is still there, she will be in hospital for a few more days but she will pull through.

'Sadie was a beautiful girl. She was never in moods or anything like that - always happy.

'Sadie enjoyed school, she enjoyed herself.

'It’s hit everybody, it’s such a shock. I haven’t been out.

'I used to go out every day, but I just can’t face people in the street, it’s just too hard'

Seven people, including two of Sadie’s cousins, were injured in the two car crash on the A548 in the village of Gwespyr, North Wales.

Flowers were yesterday left outside Bryn Pennant school where Sadie was a pupil.

Assistant head teacher Julie Davies said: 'Sadie was a bright and confident child with her whole life ahead of her.

'She was popular and well-loved by pupils and staff. She would greet visitors with a beautiful smile and a friendly comment and loved lengthy chats with her teachers.

'She was kind, sensitive, thoughtful and wise beyond her years, a real character who was adored by everyone.

'For her to be so cruelly snatched at such a young age is absolutely devastating.

'We cannot begin to imagine the distress that her poor parents and family are experiencing.

'Our hearts ache for them in their suffering. This has had a tremendous effect on the whole community.'

Mostyn councillor Patrick Heesom said: 'The whole community is distraught. Sadie was a little angel and this is completely devastating.

'Sadie was a darling - she could often be seen playing with her sister and friends.

'This is heartbreaking and my thoughts and prayers are with her parents and the rest of the family.' Police are still investigating the accident between a Vauxhall Corsa and a Ford Focus.

An inquest into Sadie's death has been opened and adjourned
