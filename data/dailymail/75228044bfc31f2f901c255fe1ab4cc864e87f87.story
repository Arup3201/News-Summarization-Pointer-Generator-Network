Mark Pougatch will have ITV’s two most high-profile pundits with him in the studio when he makes his debut as axed Adrian Chiles’s successor for the Champions League game between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea on Tuesday week.

Roy Keane, after leaving his role as assistant manager at Aston Villa, will be returning as an ITV analyst on a game-by-game basis and will have his former Manchester United team-mate Paul Scholes alongside.

Mark Pougatch has replaced Adrian Chiles as football presenter on ITV and will make his debut on the Champions League last 16 tie between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea in France next week

Neither of them hold back with their often scathing opinions, which will give new presenter Pougatch a testing environment for his first game. 

Keane’s demeanour will be fascinating as in the past his body language alone has shown what he thinks about daft questions from Chiles.
