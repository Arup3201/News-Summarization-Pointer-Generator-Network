A camera accidentally dropped into the sea captured fascinating footage of its underwater journey as it tumbled towards the ocean floor.

When the camera slid off kitesurfer Jens Knof's board as he tackled the waves off Kite Beach in the Dominican Republic, he thought it was gone for good.

But two and a half months later it was recovered by a spear-fisherman who spotted it while diving on the reef - and not only was it still intact, it had kept right on filming.

Into the blue: The lost camera kept right on filming as it tumbled towards the reef off the Dominican RepublicÂ 

Footage recovered from the GoPro Hero reveals how the camera captured the underwater scenery as it made its slow descent towards the reef.

It continued recording from its unique vantage point beneath the waves until the battery finally died.

The footage gives a fascinating glimpse into the briny deep, with fish darting into view before the currents send the camera skipping across the spiky coral once again.

Mr Knof had posted details of the 
lost camera online in the hope it might turn up, but had all but given 
up on the GoPro by the time the fisherman stumbled across it nestling in
the reef.

He was stunned 
to discover that not only was the camera still in one piece - albeit 
with a dead battery - it had filmed its journey to the bottom of the 
reef. Watch the video in full here.
