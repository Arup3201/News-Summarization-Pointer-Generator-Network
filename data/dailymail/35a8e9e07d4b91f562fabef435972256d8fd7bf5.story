If he thought he would get away with trashing a new set of CCTV cameras, then this suspected vandal was wrong.

Because the devices - set up to stop fly-tippers in rural Hertfordshire - captured his every move as he did his worst with an air rifle, causing £1,000 of damage.

St Albans City and District Council recently fixed four cameras along Bedmond Lane near Abbotts Langley after mounds of household waste were found dumped along the street.

Police want to speak to a man seen taking aim at CCTV cameras installed at a notorious fly-tipping hotspot

The CCTV cameras got clear images of the man, who was wearing a checkered shirt, jeans and white shoes

But not long after the cameras were installed, a vandal apparently drove along the road and shot at the public-funded devices.

Police have now released an image of man they want to speak to, with pictures showing him raising what looks an air rifle and taking aim at the cameras.

The incident is believed to have happened between 5pm on April 18 and 7.40am on April 21.

Vanessa Williams, landlady of the local Holly Bush pub, said: 'Flytipping has always been a problem down there.

'People come, probably on a daily basis, and drop off all manner of things, TVs, furniture, fridges, garden waste and all sorts.

'I didn't even realise they had put cameras down there but it's disgusting they have already been damaged. It doesn't suprise me though, it's the way of the world these days.'

The road is thought to have become a target for fly-tippers due to its proximity to both the M25 and M1 motorways.

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Jane Flemmons at Hertfordshire Police or call Crimestoppers, the independent charity, anonymously on 0800 555 111.
