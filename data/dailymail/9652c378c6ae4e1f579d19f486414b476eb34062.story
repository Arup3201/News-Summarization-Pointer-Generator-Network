Serbian forward Lazar Markovic has become Liverpool's fourth signing of the summer after joining the Reds in a £20million deal from Benfica.

Markovic's arrival has taken Liverpool’s spending towards the £60million mark following the arrivals of Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen.

He told Liverpool's official website: 'I am very happy that I have joined such a great club.

'I hope that I will fulfil the 
expectations of the supporters, coaches, players and all connected to 
the club. I have seen what the players are like, I have seen what the 
supporters are like, and I cannot wait to start playing here.

'I want to win titles with Liverpool and I will give 100% on the pitch.

'I watched every [Liverpool] game [last season] and they played absolutely superb. It is a shame they did not win the title and I hope we will win it this season.'

The
 Serbia international arrived on Merseyside on Sunday night ahead of 
completing a two-part medical at Spire Liverpool Hospital and the club’s
 Melwood training ground after Liverpool triggered the £20million 
release clause in his Benfica contract.

Liverpool have been pursuing Markovic all
 summer – he was a target long before it became inevitable that Luis 
Suarez would join Barcelona – and they acted quickly to land one of the 
most highly-regarded young players in Europe.

Markovic, who played a crucial role in helping Benfica win the Portuguese title last season, has agreed a long-term contract at Anfield and he joins a squad that finished runners-up to Manchester City in May.

The 20-year-old, a highly-rated left-sided attacker, will not be Liverpool’s final signing of the window by any means, with Belgium striker Divock Origi also close to joining Liverpool, while they are exploring reviving a deal for in Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno.

Liverpool are considering moves for, among others, Swansea pair Wilfried Bony and Ben Davies, QPR striker Loic Remy and they have not lost interest in Croatia defender Dejan Lovren, even though Southampton are standing firm. Borussia Dortmund’s Marco Reus, however, is not a target.

It is set to be a summer of change at Anfield , as a number of players, including Lucas Leiva and Daniel Agger, could leave; while Iago Aspas is set to complete a loan move to Sevilla with a view to a permanent £4.5m deal following talks between the two clubs.

Liverpool returned to training last week and play their first pre-season friendly tomorrow in Copenhagen against Brondby; they then face Preston at Deepdale on Saturday before heading to the United States for a tour, where they will be joined by their six England internationals.
