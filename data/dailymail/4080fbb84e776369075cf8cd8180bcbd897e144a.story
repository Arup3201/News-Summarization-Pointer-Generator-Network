Hoisted 250ft in the air on the end of a tangle of ropes, Sir David Attenborough shows you’re never too old for a tricky camera shot.

The 88-year-old naturalist has had a knee replacement and a heart pacemaker fitted but none of that was going to stop his latest assignment – filming a huge bat colony in Borneo. 

Filming Sky series Conquest of the Skies, Sir David travelled to the Gomantong cave in Borneo, home to around a million bats that emerge in a huge flock each dusk to go hunting for insects.

For this spectacular sequence, shot in 3D, he was winched up on a rope pulley and spoke to a camera fixed to a flying drone known as an ‘octocopter’. 

Sir David said: ‘In the cave you can feel the pressure build as bats emerge from the depths, from up to a mile away in the blackness. 

'They gather in an chamber just before the entrance and the crowd grows bigger and bigger into a huge maelstrom, almost a whirlpool of bats, wanting to get out to feed on the insects but not daring to while it’s still daylight because there are bat hawks out there.

‘Eventually one makes a break for it, and then they all go out, thousands of them, finding safety in numbers because there only about five bat hawks.’

He added: ‘I have been in the Gomantong bat cave before, but this time was a highlight: I was winched on ropes 250 feet above the cave floor, and with the octocopter in front of me, did a piece to camera with a million bats flying past on their way out of the cave to hunt.’

Over the course of the series, Sir David travels to China, Rome, Scotland, Ecuador and Borneo to analyse gliding reptiles, parachuting mammals, acrobatic insects and exotic birds.

Sir David has continued to work in the wake of the death of his brother, filmmaker Richard Attenborough, in August.

Last year, he was forced to pull out of a tour of Australia while he had a pacemaker fitted to his heart, but he later said the operation was ‘no big deal’.

The year before, he had a knee replaced, and he has admitted he finds it hard to walk for more than 15 minutes at a stretch.

But he told Radio Times at the time: ‘I don’t ever want to stop work. 

'Sure, something’s going to wear out some time and I won’t be able to do it, but while I can – and people want me to, and people look at the result – I’m delighted to work.

‘If I was earning my money by hewing coal I would be very glad indeed to stop. 

'But I’m not; I’m swanning around the world looking at the most fabulously interesting things. 

'Such good fortune.’

David Attenborough’s Conquest of the Skies 3D starts at 7pm on January 1 on Sky 3D and Sky 1.
