A woman who was paralyzed  after a freak accident has stunned doctors by learning to walk again.

Jaime Carnucci, 37, returned home to Hooksett, New Hampshire, last week, just seventy days after a freak diving accident left her unable to move. 

The mother of two broke her neck in August when she dove into a shallow lake - even though she had dived there several times before.

Accident: Jaime Carnucci, is pictured here in hospital with her husband Frank following the  diving accident

Updates: Her husband updated friends and family of her progress with pictures on Facebook

Support: Family and friends encouraged Carnucci to have a speedy recovery via social media sites like Twitter

She hit the bottom and injured her spinal cord, leaving her unable to move below her waist.

She told Good Morning America: ‘I remember hitting the bottom of the lake and it was just a weird feeling.’ 

‘I never felt any pain; it was just a ringing in my ears. I felt like I was floating.’

After the accident her friends kept her paralyzed body steady in the water, and called an ambulance.

She was taken into surgery that night and had a followup surgery days later that was successful. However, she emerged without any ability to move her legs.

But throughout her ordeal, her husband, Frank, remained optimistic.

Recovery: The 37-year-old worked hard to regain her ability to walk by doing excercises

Movement: The mom-of-two made a speedy recovery and did everything she could to get better

Carnuci strong: Soon relatives and friends came up with the slogan 'Carnucci strong' to encourage her to make a full recovery. They even made it into a hashtag on Twitter.

He knew that his wife was a born fighter and would work hard to regain her ability to walk. 

Her husband also updated friends and family of her progress with pictures on Facebook

She told ABC News: ‘I have the best husband in the world. He was amazing. It really takes something like this to show how close. I have no words.’

‘He did everything I could think of and he never got tired of it and he was always there. He’s the hero here, not me.’

Soon relatives and friends came up with the slogan 'Carnucci strong' to encourage her to make a full recovery. They even made it into a hash tag on Twitter.

Home: Last week, Carnucci took it step by step as she made it home with her husband Frank by her side

Strong: Just three months after her accident Carnucci returned home to see her family

Delight: Her friends and family were delighted that she had finally made it home and had recovered so quickly

‘It turned into not just pictures of Jaime, but people holding up signs with Carnucci Strong,’ her husband said.

‘It was just an onslaught of friends and family. Our neighbors started making yard signs and bumper stickers. The next thing you know our neighborhood is covered in signs.’

Last week, Carnucci made it home for the first time since her accident to the delight of her loved ones who were there to greet her.
