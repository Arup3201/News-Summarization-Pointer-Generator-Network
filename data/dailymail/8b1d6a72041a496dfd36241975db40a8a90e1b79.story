It was a notebook that was meant to be burned.

Ordered by his mother-in-law, perhaps a sign of their fractured relationship and his stormy marriage to her daughter, personal notes and 19 handwritten poems written by Dylan Thomas were meant to be destroyed.

But the book was saved from being sent to the boiler, preserving some of the poet's most cryptic poems for decades.

It has spent 70 years stashed in a brown paper bag in a desk drawer. Now, with its corrections and crossings-out it could help reveal what Thomas was thinking as he composed and revised his verses, and is expected to sell for £150,000 at auction.

Insights: This newly discovered notebook written by the poet Dylan Thomas could help to clear up some of his most cryptic lines of poetry. It is up for sale at Sotheby's and is estimated to go for as much as £150,000

A separate letter with the notebook, which is also to be sold, sheds some light on the lives of Thomas and his wife Caitlin, as shown in his dislike for her mother.

Thomas and Caitlin had a passionate but often destructive relationship, marred by drinking and infidelity by two fiercely free-spirited individuals who were introduced in a London pub.

They moved around the country, had affairs and had three children who were often not shielded from their parents' passionate rows.  

One scholar told The Times that the notebook, which goes on sale at Sotheby's in London on December 9, as 'the most exciting discovery since his [Thomas's] death in 1953.'

Written up during the a burst of creativity during the 1930s, the notebook contains early versions of poems before he met his wife, which finally appeared in Thomas's first two collections of poetry.

According to the Sotheby's catalogue notes: 'This notebook was written during a crucial year in Thomas's life and work, when he firmly established a place for himself in the literary world.

'It was a period marked by two major events: his move to London in November 1934 and the publication of his first collection, 18 Poems, the following month.

'This notebook shows that he continued to write during his months in London, but his most intense burst of creativity came when he left the city and its distractions.'

Many of Thomas's published poems were written during this period, often material he had filled his notebooks with after finishing a job as a journalist. 

Great writer: Thomas left the notebook at his mother-in-law's home and it survived despite her when the servant she instructed to burn it and Thomas's other papers decided to rescue it and keep it   

Thomas and his wife Caitlin had a fiery relationship, both known for their rows, infidelity and heavy drinking

It was left at the home of Yvonne Macnamara, Thomas's mother-in-law, with whom he had a poor relationship, and survived despite her wishes.

The pair did not get on, possibly because she had gained some insight into his relationship with her daughter which saw the couple having numerous fights fuelled by alcohol.

His mother-in-law told Louie King, a member of her household staff, to burn it in the kitchen boiler along with a lot more of the poet's notes. Instead he rescued it and it has remained in his family ever since.

A handwritten note by Mr King, seen by The Times, which is accompanying the notebook in the lot, reads: 'This book of poetry by Dylan Thomas was with a lot of papers given to me to burn in the kitchen boiler.

'I saved it and forgot all about it until I read of his death.'

Thomas's relationship with his mother-in-law is revealed by a letter which is also to be sold at Sotheby's next month. In a letter to his friend and fellow writer Charles Fisher, Thomas wrote: 'This flat English country levels the intelligence, planes down the imagination, narrows the a's, my ears belch up old wax and passages of misunderstood music.

'I sit and hate my mother-in-law, glowering at her from corners and grumbling about her in the sad, sticky quiet of the lavatory.' 

'The sad, sticky quiet of the lavatory': A letter in which Thomas alludes to his dislike of his mother-in-law. It is also up for sale at Sotheby's next month and is expected to go for between £2,000 and £2,5000 

The bounced cheque written by Thomas - a sign of his drinking as it was given to the landlord of his local pub

The lives of Dylan Thomas and wife Caitlin were depicted in 2008 film The Edge of Love with Sienna Miller 

Thomas met blonde Caitlin Macnamara in a pub in London in 1936 and the couple married a year later, having three children.

But their relationship was fractured - marked by passion, heavy drinking, arguments and infidelity.

Thomas once described their marriage as 'red, raw bleeding meat' but it was understood that Caitlin was the true rebel of the partnership. 

The couple moved between London, Wales, Oxford and Ireland - buying a house in Wales that would eventually see Thomas's reputation catch up with him. 

Caitlin Thomas-Fazio was known as the true rebel in the marriage to Thomas, and died in 1994 

In 1945 a jealous husband fired a machine gun at the house, thinking he was having an affair with his wife. Whether he actually did has been long disputed, although his wife later conceded the man may have been cross because they had been drinking so much of his money. 

So notorious was the incident that it was made into a film The Edge of Love, starring Sienna Miller.

Their daughter Aeronwy described an upbringing where she often had to look after her younger brother Colm while her parents went out drinking. 

The poet was also said to be frustrated with his limited means as a writer - supplementing his income with broadcasts on BBC which saw him rise in popularity. He was also said to be angered by the way his wife kept their home, which had no running water or electricity. They also had numerous unpaid bills.  

Thomas would frequently travel to America in the 1950s and Caitlin later found out he had a fling, which became the subject of many rows between the couple. 

But in 1953 fell ill while drinking. At the time the poet claimed he had drunk 16 whiskies. 

Despite the rows and affairs, it was Caitlin who rushed to his bedside and was with him when he died. She was so overcome with grief that she had to be put in a strait jacket and taken to a mental health hospital. It is said that his latest mistress was also at the bed, causing Caitlin to fly into a rage. 

The sale of the notebook and letter comes after a pair of bounced cheques given by Thomas to the landlord of his local pub sold at auction for £3,750.

The two cheques, both made out for £3 and signed by the Welsh writer, were given to Phil Richards who was the landlord of the Cross House Inn in Thomas's home town of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire.

They went under the hammer at Bonhams in Knightsbridge, London, fetching more than several books of his verse which were also sold that day.
