This astonishing new photograph shows legendary American gunman Billy the Kid, a historian has claimed.

The man on the right of this picture - taken around 1879 -  is believed to be the Wild West gunslinger.

The picture is now generating huge excitement because, if authenticated, it would be only the second known image of the notorious outlaw. The other fetched more than $2million at 
auction.

Rare: This astonishing new photograph shows legendary American gunman Billy the Kid, a historian has claimed. The famous outlaw is pictured, right, with his friend Dan Dedrick left

The image, as reported by the Las Cruces Sun News, was released by New Mexico historian Frank Parrish.

He claims to have extensively researched the picture to back up his claim that it is Billy the Kid. A large part of this involved identifying the man on the left, who he claims is Dan Dedrick -  a close friend of the outlaw.

Speaking to the Albuquerque Journal, 
Mr Parrish said: 'Identification of Dedrick is the "clincher" in this 
image, elevating a near-certain image to a clearly and obvious picture 
of the Kid.

Pricey: This picture of Billy the Kid was sold for $2million at auction to billionaire William Koch

'It’s finally a good image of the Kid 
that reveals a young man as people who remembered him described him – 
not as the famous bucktoothed Billy we know so well.'

It is thought the picture was taken when the gunslinger was 20 - two years before he was killed.

Mr Parrish admitted that some people will be skeptical of the picture. But he is absolutely certain that it shows Billy the Kid.

'It’s Billy,' he said.

The only only surviving authentic photograph of the outlaw was expected to make $400,000 at an auction in 2011.

But billionaire William Koch ended up paying more than $2million for it.

The photograph - a tintype owned 
by Dedrick's family for years - shows Billy the Kid packing a Colt 
revolver and trademark 1873 Winchester carbine rifle.

After
 its purchase, the 71-year-old told the Denver Post: 'I love the Old 
West. I plan on enjoying it and discreetly sharing it.

'I think I'll 
display it in a few small museums.'

The
 photo was taken outside a saloon in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, when Billy
 the Kid, born William Henry McCarty and later known as outlaw William 
Bonney, was barely out of his teens.

Experts estimate it was taken around 1879.

But 132 years later, it endures as the most recognisable photo of the American West.

It was only expected to fetch between
 $300,000 and $400,000, but the price climbed dramatically in just two 
minutes after Mr Koch began bidding.

The
 Kid gave the photograph to his friend, Dan Dedrick, and it's been kept 
in the family for the last century, going on public display only once at
 Lincoln County Museum in New Mexico in 1986 to 1998.

It
 was famously featured in a book by Pat Garrett, the sheriff who gunned 
Billy down on July 14, 1881 - 130 years ago next month.

Billy the Kid was a notorious 19th-century American gunman who was celebrated for his skill with guns.

According to popular legend he killed 21 men, however,  it is generally believed that this figure is more likely to be between four and nine.

He is thought to have been 17 when he killed his first man in 1877 - although some historians say he could have been as young as 15.

Notorious: This image from the 1973 film 'Pat Garatt and Billy the Kid' starred Kris Kristofferson as the outlaw and Richard Jaeckel as a sheriff

He was friendly and personable and a smart dresser, often wearing a Mexican sombrero. These qualities contributed to his image as both a notorious outlaw and a folk hero.

He was catapulted into legend in 1881 when New Mexico's governor, Lew Wallace, placed a price on his head.

This prompted newspapers to carry stories about his exploits.

It has been claimed that Billy the Kid was shot dead by Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881 despite being promised clemency for testifying in a murder case.

He was killed a few months after escaping from jail.
