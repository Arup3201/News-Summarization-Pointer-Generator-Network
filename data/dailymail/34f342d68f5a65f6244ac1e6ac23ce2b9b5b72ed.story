The latest trend in bridal photography, Trash The Dress, has officially arrived in Britain.

Deliberately ruining a wedding dress soon after a couple's big day is a romantic ritual meant to symbolise commitment, as the wrecked gown can never be worn again, and it's big business for photographers in the U.S.

Now photographer Arran Tomlinson is pioneering the idea - also known as 'fearless bridal' or 'rock the frock' - here in the UK.

He says the aim is to give brides ‘stunning’ and ‘unusual’ pictures to contrast with those taken on their wedding day.

The genre, which originates from Las Vegas, contrasts elegant clothing with an unusual environment such as scruffy woods, on a beach, on rooftops, rubbish dumps, fields, and abandoned buildings.

Dresses can be burned and torn to shreds or just muddied up - giving the wearer the option to clean and keep or bin it.

Rachael Snape, 27, from Blackburn, Lancashire, chose to trash her dress at Roddlesworth Reservoir, Tockholes after her marriage to council worker Paul three weeks ago.

After the traditional bride and groom pictures are shot, the bride deliberately wrecks her gown

'The dress got dirty but it’s nothing a good dry cleaner couldn’t fix,' said Tomlinson.

'Brides do it as they’ve had the wedding and they just want to do something different. 

'They want something else to remember.'

The Trash The Dress idea is rapidly gaining fans around the world as women arrange for photographers to capture their wedding gowns being destroyed in order to create some very personal art.

Photographer Arran Tomlinson says brides want something else to remember these days

The results often resemble the type of photographs seen in glossy fashion magazines.

Arran said: 'It’s a style of photography originally from the States and it’s only just catching on here now.

'From a photographer’s point of view I thought it was something that made amazing pictures.

'I went on social media and asked if anyone wanted to trash their dress, and Rachael stepped forward.

'As soon as I had done the shoot, I had another one booked.

'The next bride is even more extreme - she wants paint thrown at her!'
