Conman: Unscrupulous Peter Wall, 30, spun Rebecca Kew 'a web of lies' about his past in order to get her to buy things for him, a court heard

A conman who met a woman on a dating website spun an extraordinary web of lies to impress her.

Peter Wall, 30, claimed to be an Army captain who had won the Military Cross in Afghanistan.

He told 25-year-old Rebecca Kew that he helped police track down dangerous gunmen Raoul Moat and Derrick Bird.

And that was only the start of his deception, Bradford Crown Court was told.

He boasted that he had been given a job catching and cooking wild animals on a  television programme hosted by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.

He said his mother lived in Australia, his father was dead and he had a twin sister who had died in car crash near her 21st birthday.

He told her that he saved his family from a house fire at the age of eight, that he was a former professional rugby player with a first-class degree from Loughborough, that he had been fast-tracked through the Army after Sandhurst and that his brother was head chef at a Marcus Wareing restaurant.

He also said he had been head hunted by MI5 and M16, his stepfather was a gangster and his best friend had committed suicide.

In fact, he was a former logistics engineer in the Army who was discharged on medical grounds in 2006 without having risen from the rank of private. His mother was in Liverpool.

The court heard that a month after making contact over the internet, Wall, from Blackburn, texted Miss Kew to say he had been hit by a car and was in hospital.

He claimed he had nowhere to go. Having given him several hundreds of pounds for hotels, Miss Kew introduced him to her parents and he soon moved in to their home in Todmorden, West Yorkshire.

Wall told the Kews he wanted to do a charity walk for Help for Heroes, so charity boxes were placed in their fish-and-chip shop. As well as professing his love for her, Wall told Miss Kew he was earning £4,000 a month but she became suspicious when he kept asking her to pay for things.

In July 2011 he arrived at her home in an Audi, which the court heard was owned by another woman he was seeing, before packing his bags and leaving.

At that point Miss Kew, who lost almost £3,000, researched him on the internet and found he had a string of previous convictions.

When she texted him asking what was going on, he replied: ‘You weren’t supposed to get hurt. Take care.’

Wall admitted three charges of fraud by false representation.

Jailing him for a year, Judge John Potter said: ‘This was a determined and devious course of offending.’
