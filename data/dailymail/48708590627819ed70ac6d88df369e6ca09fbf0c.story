A woman gave birth to 'mono mono' twin girls on Thursday - a week after another woman at the same Ohio hospital gave birth to mono mono twin girls.

Amanda Arnold, 24, gave birth to twins JaNiya and Amaya McCail at Akron General Medical Center via C-section.

'Thereâ€™s only a 1 in 10,000 chance that a woman will become pregnant with monoamniotic twins,' the hospital said in a press release, which described having both pregnancies at Akron General Medical Center 'almost a statistical impossibility.'

'Mono mono' twins share placenta and an amniotic sac and are considered risky to carry because they can be killed by umbilical cords, the hospital said.

Arnold and boyfriend James McCail's 5-year-old son 'Little James' was very happy to find out he was going to have siblings, the release said.

Arnold was placed on a month-long bed rest and the twins were delivered on May 15 to honor the anniversary of grandmother Valerie McCail's death, the release said.

Father James McCail expressed his joy with NewsNet5, who filmed inside the delivery room.

'It feels great,' he told the station. 'I'm so happy right now. I just want to see my babies for the first time up close a little bit.'

MailOnline reported last week that Sarah Thistlethwaite gave birth to daughters Jenna and Jillian on May 9 at Akron General Medical Center, also via a C-section. Those twins became famous when they were found holding hands when presented to Thistlethwaite and her husband Bill.

Sarah Thistlethwaite had been placed on a 57-day bed rest while waiting to give birth, the Akron Beacon-Journal reported last week.
