A daughter watched as her parents and teenage brother were swept into the ocean in northern California while trying to save their dog, authorities revealed today.

The couple, who have not been identified, were later found dead and a search continues for the 16-year-old boy, who is still missing.

The girl was at Big Lagoon, a beach by Eureka, which is 300 miles north of San Fransisco in California, as her family was dragged into the water, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard said.

Authorities received a 911 call at 12.40pm to report that the trio was in trouble, but the Coast Guard could not confirm whether the daughter placed the call.

Tragedy: A couple has been killed and their teenage son is missing after they tried to save their dog from huge waves in Big Lagoon, California. A massive search is underway for the boy

The tragedy unfolded after the family's dog chased after a thrown stick and was swept into the ocean by eight to ten foot waves.

Dana Jones, a state Parks and Recreation district superintendent said the boy went after the dog, prompting his father to go after them.

She said the teenager was able to get
out, but when he didn't see his father, he and his mother went into the
water looking for him.

'Both were dragged into the ocean,' Jones said.

Ms Jones said a park ranger who was alerted to the incident had to 
run a half mile to get to the beach because his car wasn't made to 
handle the terrain.

When he arrived, he wasn't able to get to them 
because of the high surf, she said.

Hunt: Authorities have found no sign of the 16-year-old after searching the area for hours

Rescuers eventually retrieved the mother's body and the father's body washed up.

The dog got out of the water on its own, Jones said.

The Coast Guard deployed a helicopter 
and two motor life boats to search for the teenager, but the aerial 
search was suspended by 7pm by thick coastal fog.

Helicopters remain on standby and U.S. Coast Guard officials planned to 
continue searching in the dark if the fog lifted. Two 47-foot motor life
boats were also on the scene searching for the boy.

The search continued on Sunday with no further discoveries. The local Sheriff's department is periodically checking along the coast for any sign of the boy, the Coast Guard said.
