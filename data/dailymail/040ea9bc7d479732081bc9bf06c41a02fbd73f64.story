Federal agents investigated a series of terror threats including one against Beyoncé at last year's Super Bowl in New Orleans, a new report reveals.

A 34-minute power cut during the game between San Francisco's 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens on February 3 sparked mass panic and an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security.

But it has since emerged detectives were also alerted to an anonymous call made hours before kick-off which threatened to blow up the stadium at half-time.

Threats: Documents reveal an anonymous phone call warned Beyoncé's stage would explode at half time

Probe: The Department of Homeland Security investigated the 34-minute power cut and four more threats

None of the investigations were made public until Thursday.

The information, obtained from a Freedom of Information request by News 4 I-team, revealed an unidentified caller used a pay phone to contact the Mercedes-Benz Louisiana Superdrome with a threat to the stadium and Crazy In Love singer.

It said: 'The Mercedez-Benz building in New Orleans is going to blow up. It's gonna blow up after Beyoncé's performance.'

The caller was never found.

Another caller warned police the Krazy Korner Bar in the city's French Quarter, which was screening the game, was lined with explosives.

Fears: Security was high as the San Francisco 49ers played the Baltimore Ravens in New Orleans in 2013

Explosive warning: Another caller said the entire Mercedez-Benz Superdrome would be blown up

It sparked an emergency raid hours before kick-off, forcing owners to clear the bar.

Minutes later, a bomb threat was made against the staging area of the stadium, prompting an FBI search. No explosives were found.

And earlier that day, more than 12 police weapons were stolen from the unmarked car of New Orleans Police Officer Frankie Watts, including a semi-automatic handgun, an assault rifle, a tactical vest, swat team gear and a Taser gun.

Two suspects were detained in May. Only the swat team gear and tactical vest were recovered.
