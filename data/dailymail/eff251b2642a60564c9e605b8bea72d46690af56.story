His Sydney fashion show hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons this week.

And on Wednesday morning designer Alex Perry told Today Show hosts Lisa Wilkinson and Karl Stefanovic that he shouldn't have put models like Cassi Van Den Dungen on the runway.

Alex, who said he 'recoiled' as he was shown the images from Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week on Monday, admitted: 'It's not an image I think is good to put forward.'

Courting controversy: Model Cassi Van Den Dungen faced a recent backlash after looking gaunt at Alex Perry's Australian Fashion Week show

'It was a serious lack of judgement on my part that I let that happen.

'I'm not excusing it at all because I don't think it's right, but 14 hours days, you try to get everything finished in time.

'I got distracted. I chatted to Cassi I've known her for a long time. I should have made that call. I was off the ball.'

He added: 'I'm putting my hands up, it was wrong, it was the wrong image to present.'

But he added that everyone in the fashion industry needs to work together to make a difference.

'A lot of people are complicit in that. We've all got a hand in it.'

Just hours after Alex spoke out Cassi appeared on Dion Lee's catwalk show in baggy trousers and a long-armed white jumper.

Instead Alex said there should be more models like Alessandra Ambrosio: 'Alessandra is the right image for women to see because she's aspirational and beautiful.'

Big debate: Lisa Wilkinson and Karl Stefanovic have been passionate about the skinny models debate

Shock: The 21-year-old's skeletal frame drew more than one concerned eye as she displayed her thin thighs and protruding elbow joints at Alex Perry's runway show

However Alex said he wasn't going to shy away from his responsibility.

'I'll cop that because I shouldn't have promoted that image. When I saw it after the show I knew immediately that it was wrong,' he said.

Alex later appeared on Mornings where he reiterated his feelings to Sonia Kruger and David Campbell saying: 'I had to put my hands up because it was wrong. I will do what I can to change things as long as everyone else does too. I won't drop the ball again.'

Gaunt: The second placing reality star, who was dubbed 'the next Kate Moss' on the competition series, revealed her  sunken cheeks and gaunt facial features

Cassi caused no shortage of controversy as a fresh faced 16-year-old on Australia's Next Top Model.

But 21-year-old mother-of-one looked dramatically thinner than her teenage self as she revealed her slim legs, protruding elbow joints and gaunt and sunken cheeks, hit back at claims she is too skinny.

Posting two photos of food on her Instagram account the next on Tuesday, Cassi left a string of hashtag references defending her skeletal physique.

Before: Cassi had a much fuller face when she appeared on the show in 2009

Love my job, love food, I am who I am, deal with it' (sic) she wrote alongside a photo of a buffet filled with yogurt, fresh fruit and pastries.

A second image posted minutes earlier shows a rucksack filled with Starburst and Haribo sweets, two butter croissants, a banana, a can of energy drink and bottle of water which she boasts is her breakfast for the day.

Taking to the runway at Alex Perry's Autumn/Winter showcase on Monday, Cassi was one of a host of worryingly thin models prompting seasoned front row spectators to voice concern.

Defending her frame: Cassi posted two images of food on her Instagram page on Tuesday morning writing, 'Love food, I am who I am, deal with it.'

Mia Freedman, the creator of Mamma Mia,  dubbed the show: 'The hunger games', while Jackie Frank, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire was compelled to phone one model's agent to inquire after her health.

'When I saw those legs I nearly died,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

'I rang the model agent and said, "Why is that girl walking down the runway when she's clearly not healthy?"'

On Sunrise this morning Jackie continued the debate, telling David Koch and Samantha Armytage: 'Models are genetically blessed, they are thinner, longer, leaner than most average people but I want to draw a line in the sand and I think that the industry needs to as well.'

The fashion industry has long come under fire for their tiny sample sizes which promote the development of unhealthy eating habits.

Models feel intense pressure to fit the sizes or face loosing their livelihood.

Brazilian stunner and Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio headlined Alex Perry's runway on Monday and speaking to Today on Tuesday morning said she enjoys eating bacon and egg sandwiches before her shows.

The striking Victoria's Secret alum cut a much healthier and athletic figure as she walked alongside the skeletal Australian models.

Cassi was the runner up in the 2009 cycle of Australia's Next Top Model which was won by Tahnee Atkinson, who in contrast is known for her curvy and voluminous figure.

The young model drew media attention for her angry, foul mouthed outbursts and smoking habit on the show, and famously turned down a modelling contract with a New York agency.

Since finishing the popular competition series, she has been working locally and internationally, appearing at the Melbourne Fashion Festival and walking for up-market brands such as Miu Miu in Paris.

She is also mother to her nearly three-year-old son Drake who was born with a cleft lip and palate.
