Hackers Lizard Squad have allegedly disrupted gaming on XBox Live and Daybreak Games this weekend.

The group, who work anonymously, reportedly issued a 'DDos' (distributed denial of service), on Friday for Daybreak Games, formerly Sony Online Entertainment, which confirmed server problems for multiplayers.

On Monday, Lizard Squad claimed to be attacking Xbox.

A Microsoft spokesperson told Daily Mail Online: 'On February 15, we experienced a brief service interruption to Xbox Live and quickly restored services to normal.'

One Twitter account, attributed to the Lizard Squad, tweeted in the early hours of Monday: 'A bird told us #xboxlive will be #xboxlivedown shortly. Weird'

This was followed by: 'Anyone else notice how quiet @Xbox & @XboxSupport were when we knocked the networks off earlier for 3 hours?  #xboxlive'

 A separate Lizard Squad account tweeted: 'Xbox (360) Live #offline' before adding: 'brb. More to come, it's about time to re-ignite lizardsquad.'

Gamers were reporting problems with their services on social media.  

In December, Sony Corp's PlayStation Network suffered connection problems for several days after hackers attacked the video game network.

Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for disrupting both the PlayStation Network and Microsoft Corp's Xbox Live on Christmas Day.   

Several accounts attributed to the Lizard Squad were tweeting on Monday about attacking Xbox. A Microsoft spokesperson told Daily Mail Online: 'On February 15, we experienced a brief service interruption to Xbox Live and quickly restored services to normal'

Sony has been the victim of some of the most high-profile security breaches in history.

In late November, Sony Pictures' computer system was taken down by hackers protesting the film, The Interview, which depicted the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

President Barack Obama has blamed the North Korean government for the attack.

Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for attacks on the PlayStation Network in early December and August of this year. 

The August attack coincided with a bomb scare in which Lizard Squad tweeted to American Airlines that it heard explosives were on board a plane carrying an executive with Sony Online Entertainment.

In 2011, hackers stole data belonging to 77 million PlayStation Network users.
