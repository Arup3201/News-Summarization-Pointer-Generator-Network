Barack Obama told his aides: ‘I just don’t know if I can do this’ after his woeful performance during the first Presidential debate last year, a new book claims.

The President was being drilled by staffers to do better in the second round when he told them he wasn’t sure if he was up to the job.

They were so rattled that they feared he might lose the election.

The candid admission shows how just how scared Obama was - and how unprepared he had been to take on his Republican opponent Mitt Romney.

It also makes clear that behind the scenes the President agreed with observers who said that he had been ‘dismal’ and seemed like he was asleep.

The first Presidential debate took place on October 3 last year with Obama narrowly ahead of Romney in the polls going into it.

But when the lights went down Romney was the clear winner after coming across as more punchy - whilst the President rambled and seemed nervous.

Mr Obama did not even mentioning Romney’s notorious 47 per cent remark, or his past at hedge fund Bain Capital even though his campaign had been hammering it for months.

According to New York magazine, in a excerpt from their new book ‘Double Down: Game Change 2012’, journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann say that at the White House aides to Mr Obama staged an ‘intervention’ to pull him back from the brink.

During the process they claim the President was struck by self-doubt and said: ‘I just don’t know if I can do this’, referring to what was needed in the second debate. 

Defeated: Mitt Romney was deemed the winner of the first debate after Obama's lackluster performance

To solve the problem debate coach Ron
 Klain was brought in and Bill Clinton, First Lady Michelle Obama and 
Secretary of State John Kerry all gave him advice.

In the second debate Obama was a different person and, according to ‘Double Down’, thought his performance was ‘fast and hammy’.

Revealed: The new details are shared in 'Double Down', which is out next week

Previously reported extracts from the book have already painted Romney in an unflattering light.

It
 claims that he didn't ask Chris Christie to be his candidate for vice 
president in his 2012 bid for the White House because of 'potential 
landmines' in his health and background checks.

The
 New Jersey governor failed to fully answer questions about his health 
and background and provided less information to Romney's vetters than 
other potential candidates, the book says

Romney
 also poked fun at Christie's size. 'Romney marveled at Christie's 
girth,' according to the book. 'Watching a video of Christie without his
 suit jacket on, Romney cackled to his aides "guys! Look at that"'.

Romney's search for a vice-presidential nominee was codenamed 'Project goldfish', but Christie was given the name 'Pufferfish'.

In
 response to the revelations, an aide to Christie said: 'Governor 
Christie complied fully with the Romney campaign’s request for documents
 in a timely manner, including a complete medical report from his 
internist and cardiologist.'

Christie,
 who underwent lap band surgery in February to help him lose weight, 
recently released a report from his doctor that said he 'has no medical 
limitations and is fit to serve as the governor'.

The book also reveals that President Obama's aides considered switching Joe Biden out for Hillary Clinton as his VP.

Dropped: Romney, pictured with his wife Ann, re-considered Christie but ultimately decided to drop him

The authors explain that Christie, who is widely seen as a top candidate among Republicans for 2016, left unanswered questions about a defamation lawsuit that was brought against him earlier in his career - putting off Romney further.

He also avoided information about a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement involving his brother, the names and documentation of his household help, details about his time as a securities industry lobbyist and on his medical history, the New York Times reported.

'The dossier on the Garden State governor’s background was littered with potential land mines,' the authors write.

It led Romney to initially consider Christie before striking him off the list - then reconsider before eventually dropping him again.

Some of the other concerns were over Christie's defamation cases - he has both sued and been sued for defamation.

In 1994, his Morris County freeholder primary opponents sued him for claiming they were under investigation by the county prosecutor, the New Jersey Star Ledger explained. The case was settled and Christie apologized.

By his side: The book also revealed that Obama's aides considering dropping Joe Biden as his VP

In 1997, Christie sued opponent John Murphy after losing his primary for re-election as a freeholder, but details of the outcome was never disclosed.

In another book published earlier this year, Christie had branded the vetting forms 'intrusive', saying the Romney campaign expected him to complete 75 pages.

'Asked about stuff with your kids, and issues with your children, obviously criminal record, mental health issues drinking history, drug history,' he told Dan Balz for 'Collision 2012'. 'All intrusive stuff.'

Romney also didn't like the way he showed up late to campaign events, according to the Washington Post.

But there seems to have been no love lost from Christie's side either. The book claims Christie concluded Romney's campaign team was a 'gaggle of clowns who couldn't organize a one-ring circus', according to the Post.

When Christie came under fire for his RNC speech, claims the book, he confronted Ron Kaufman, a Romney aide, and screamed: 'I'm tired of you people!!! Leave me the f***k alone!!!!'

Another major revelation in 'Double Down' is that Obama's top aides secretly considered replacing Biden with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and carried out focus group sessions and pollings to help them decide it it were the right decision.

Ruled out: But aides ultimately concluded that she would not give enough of a boost to justify the move

The consideration was pushed by the chief of staff at the time, William M. Daley, who explained that opinion of Obama in 2011 was at an all time low.

‘I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,' he said. 'You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"'

But the aides eventually dismissed the plan, concluding that, although Clinton was a popular candidate, it would not give a big enough boost to justify the radical move, the Times reported.

The book also details Obama's opinion of Bill Clinton, saying that he found him exhausting and once told an aide: 'I like him... in doses.'

But ultimately, it explains, Obama came to rely on Clinton as a counselor and immediately called him following Romney's concession call on election night.
