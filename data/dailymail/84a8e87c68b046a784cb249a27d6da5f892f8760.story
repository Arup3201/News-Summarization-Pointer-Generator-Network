It looks like something out of a fairytale.

But this sparkling 18th century crystal grotto is very much a reality - and has today been unveiled after a one-year restoration project.

Writer, photographer and broadcaster Lady Lucinda Lambton, who has been described as a 'crusader' for the nation's architectural heritage, placed the last crystal in the grotto's stalactite mineral decoration.

It is part of the historic Painshill Park landscape garden created between 1738 and 1773 by politician Charles Hamilton near Cobham, Surrey.

The 158-acre Grade I listed site was inspired by Renaissance art and Hamilton’s Grand Tours of Europe.

Following the £747,400 restoration work, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the grotto will be open to visitors at weekends from next month.

Over 80,000 visitors a year now visit Painshill.

His
 Royal Highness, The Prince of Wales, Royal Patron of Painshill Park 
Trust also visits Painshill to view the on-going restoration of the 18th
 century landscape and its iconic follies.

The grounds were created in the 
naturalistic style between 1738 and 1773, and was the artistic vision of
 the Honourable Charles Hamilton, 9th son and 14th child of the 6th Earl
 of Abercorn.

Charles Hamilton decided to create a tranquil landscape setting enriched by follies, water, trees, shrubberies and a vineyard

Inspired by 
Renaissance and contemporary art and visits to Italy on the Grand Tour, 
the Hon. Charles Hamilton decided to create a tranquil landscape setting
 enriched by follies, water, trees, shrubberies and a vineyard.

A painter, plantsman and brilliantly 
imaginative designer, the Hon. Charles Hamilton created a garden of 
‘moods’ which change from one part to another, creating a romantic 
landscape to stimulate the senses and emotions of the visitor.

The
 Hon. Charles Hamilton created a stunning ‘living work of art’ and was, 
at the time, in the forefront of the picturesque movement.

The landscape was among the earliest to reflect the changing fashion from geometric formality to the naturalistic style.

Painshill
 Park Trust is supported by volunteers and in 2011 this dedicated team 
received The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service.
