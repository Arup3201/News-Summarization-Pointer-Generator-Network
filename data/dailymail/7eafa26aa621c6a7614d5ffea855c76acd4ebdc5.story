Jonny Wilkinson appeared to confirm rumours that he will receive a knighthood in the Queen’s New Year’s Honours by posting a thank you message on Twitter.

England’s 2003 World Cup winning fly-half is expected to become ‘Sir Jonny’ when the list is published on Wednesday, in recognition of his charity work and services to rugby.

He said to his 250,000 followers on Monday night: ‘So many more deserving amongst u who won't get recognition. To you I say thanks 4 the lessons in life. 4 the messages- u guys are incredible.’

Wilkinson earned an OBE in 2004 and went on to win every major trophy before retiring in the summer.

The No 10 has a reputation as one of sport’s most humble personalities, despite being capped 91 times by England during a 17-year career.

He made his senior debut as a teenager for Newcastle Falcons in 1998 and hung up his boots after captaining Toulon, where he held bilingual team talks, to a Top 14 and Heineken Cup double.

Out of the 2003 World Cup winning squad, only Sir Clive Woodward, the coach, has previously been knighted. Martin Johnson, the captain, was made a CBE in 2004.
