A shopper bit down on a hard object in his bag of peanuts only to discover it was a human tooth.

Teenager Graham Calder inadvertently crunched the molar into three pieces before spitting them out.

He noticed it still had the root attached.

The 18-year-old was concerned it may have been his own, but after feeling around his mouth he realised it wasn't.

His girlfriend, Michaela Epp, said it looked like the tooth had been pulled right out of the gum.

'It definitely didn't look like someone's tooth had just broken off,' said the 18-year-old, who is a student at the University of Manitoba in Canada.

Mr Calder claimed he found the tooth in a brand of Spanish peanuts distributed by Safeway Inc, which operates out of Calgary, it was reported by The Winnipeg Sun.

He said he bought the sealed bag from a Safeway store in Osborne Village in Winnipeg while on a break from studying at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta.

He was celebrating the New Year when he decided to tuck into the snack around 15 minutes after midnight.

Miss Epp said: 'My boyfriend looked me and said "that's one way to start things".'

Betty Kellsey, a spokeswoman for Safeway, said the company would properly look into the claims once the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) had investigated the complaint.

She added: 'Safeway is committed to industry leading food safety standards and we will co-operate fully with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in their investigation.'

The CFIA has taken the bag away for testing.
