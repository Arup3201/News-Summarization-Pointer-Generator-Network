Four San Antonio women convicted of sexually assaulting two young girls in 1994 could soon be cleared.

Bexar County prosecutor Rico Valdez said he and an attorney for the 'San Antonio 4' agree that a key expert witness' testimony is now discredited.

A judge is scheduled to review findings of fact on Monday that will be sent to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.

Convicted: Elizabeth Ramirez (left) was sentenced to 37.5 years while Cassandra 'Cassie' Rivera (right) was given 15 years

Anna Vasquez and her girlfriend, Cassandra Rivera, along with their friends Kristie Mayhugh and Elizabeth Ramirez, were accused of sexually assaulting Ramirez's two nieces, who were then seven and nine, according to sanantonio.com.

The girls claimed the women called them into an apartment in which they were getting drunk and smoking pot and held them by their wrists and ankles.

They said the women repeatedly violated them and threatened to kill them and their families before releasing them. 

The graphic allegations sparked talk the women participated in a Satanic ritual.

The women, all lesbians, were convicted in 1998 based on an expert's testimony that vaginal injuries sustained by the nine-year-old girl could have been caused by an assault.

Ramirez, who was tried first, was sentenced to 37.5 years while Rivera and Mayhugh each received 15 years.

Vasquez was also sentenced to 15 years, but was released on parole last year after serving 12 years.

The youngest accuser, Stephanie Martinez (nee Limon), now 25, recanted her statement publicly on August 4, 2012.

Prosecutor Valdez and the women's attorney, Mike Ware, agree the testimony wouldn't stand today.
