Steven Gerrard must take his time before deciding whether to commit his future to Liverpool, according to his former England team-mate Gary Neville.

The Reds skipper is out of contract next summer and is yet to sign a new deal despite being offered a contract beyond this season by Brendan Rodgers.

But Neville, who has forged a successful media career since hanging up his boots, insists that both parties must not rush into a decision before Christmas.

The former Manchester United defender admits that he is only just starting to have a clear idea of what he wants to do in the future as he juggles his role as a Sky Sports pundit with coaching duties for the Three Lions.Â 

Writing in his column for The Daily Telegraph, Neville said: 'Steven Gerrard has entered the 'storm phase' of his career, when big decisions are unavoidable. I can empathise because I'm still in a fact-finding stage of life where he will eventually join me.

'A footballer's life is divided into two halves. From 35-40 the player almost becomes a 16-year-old again, with a blank space stretching out in front. Only now am I starting to feel clearer about how I want the second half of my own life to be. Liverpool's captain is entitled to think about his future with his main focus on what's best for him.

'This week Gerrard told Liverpool fans that he would speak to them when the time was right, which was a sensible stance. I can't quite understand where the fire is coming from on this issue. The idea that a 34-year-old can decide his future before Christmas seems odd to me. My take on it would be that both parties should sit back and relax. There are no flames.'

Gerrard can agree a free transfer to a club outside of England from January but Neville sees no reason for Liverpool to panic about losing their captain for nothing.

'The fuss over the decision-making seems counterproductive,' he adds.

'Gerrard and Liverpool Football Club should be making a decision, I would say, around March or April next year. The club should have planned already (or be planning) for life without him. That would be true for any 34-year-old, however illustrious. Gerrard, on the other hand, is approaching post-career mode in his thinking. As so many footballers find, there is no manual and no right or wrong path.'
