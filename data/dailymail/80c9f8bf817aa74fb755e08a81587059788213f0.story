Doll's houses are usually modeled after dream homes, from sparkling Malibu mansions to opulent Georgian townhouses.

But a new design was inspired by the eerie ruins scattered around the city of Detroit.

Jen Spectacular, who created the 'scary' Victorian structure, told Cool Hunting that she hopes to pass it on to someone who will 'love' it.

Shabby chic: Dollhouses are usually modeled after dream homes but a new design was inspired by the eerie, modern ruins scattered around Detroit

The miniature three-story abode features blackened, moss-covered brickwork, climbing ivy and crackled window frames.

Inside, Ms Spectacular has also painstakingly applied the shabby-chic look.

Bathroom sinks have chipped enamel, damp-looking wallpaper peels at the edges, while chandeliers dangle precariously from ceiling cornices.

Working to a vintage theme, Ms Spectacular made each static inhabitant a tiny retro-style outfit.

It took her over two-and-a-half years to build, paint, furnish and install electricity in the doll's house.

'I suppose it's worth around $5,000 with all the little bits and pieces; time and effort,' she revealed to MailOnline.

Welcome to the house of horrors: Ms Spectacular says that her work 'tends to focus on imagination'

The former advertising illustrator has been crafting dolls and doll's houses from her San Francisco studio since 2008.

She writes on her Facebook page that her work 'tends to focus on imagination' and she looks to her 'childhood and dreams' for inspiration.

For architectural influence, she is 
haunted by the bleak images of Detroit, which has gone through major 
economic a decline in recent decades,.

She grew up about an hour north of the city and ended up working there for 15 years.

While most professional doll's makers 
make a considerable profit from their one-of-a-kind designs, Ms 
Spectacular says that she isn't in it for the money.

'It’s more important to give them to people like close friends or charity. I just want to give the house to someone who'll love it,' she explained to Cool Hunting.

Now she has finished her Victorian home she says her ultimate goal is to refurbish the damaged doll's house that her grandfather gave her as a child.
