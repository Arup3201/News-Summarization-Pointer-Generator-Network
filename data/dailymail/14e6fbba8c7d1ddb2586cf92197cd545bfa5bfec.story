A Pennsylvania university said on Monday its president has resigned after he was criticized for comments he made about women and sexual assault.

Lincoln University's board of trustees said it accepted Robert Jennings' resignation. The university named general counsel Valerie Harrison as acting president.

Jennings had at first defended his remarks and then apologized earlier this month for his comments.

He made remarks at an all-women's convocation in September about how false rape allegations can ruin a young man's life.

According to philly.com, Jennings said: ''We have, we had, on this campus last semester three cases of young women who after having done whatever they did with young men and then it didn't turn out the way they wanted it to turn out, guess what they did. They went to Public Safety and said, ''He raped me.'"

He went on: 'Don't put yourself in a situation that would cause you to be trying to explain something that really needs no explanation had you not put yourself in that situation.' 

He then added: 'Men treat you, treat women, the way women allow us to treat them ... We will use you up if you allow us to use you up.'

Then men, he continued, will 'marry the girl with the long dress on'. 

Portions of the remarks were posted online and some parents criticized them as appearing to blame women for sexual assault.

Board chair Kimberly Lloyd announced Jennings' departure in a letter posted to the university's website.

The bulk of Lloyd's letter focused on Harrison and the future of the historically black university in rural Chester County, about 45 miles west of Philadelphia.
