Don't let the cuddly toys and soft furnishings fool you – it’s not easy being an infant.

In fact, more and more parents are opting to help their busy babies unwind after a stressful day by visiting a baby spa.

The concept of ‘baby spas’ aren’t new but they are becoming increasingly popular as mothers claim the experience help their children to sleep.

More parents are opting to help babies unwind by visiting a spa where they can bob about and be pampered

At this spa in Houston, Texas, babies aged between two weeks and eight months are put in waterproof nappies and then fitted with a double-circle flotation device to support their head and neck. 

The floats allow the babies to move their arms and legs in the water as the bob and play for about 25 minutes. 

Parents are then guided through a gentle baby massage. The hour-long experience costs £40 ($65).

Kristi Ison opened the spa in her home in October last year but it was so popular that by February she had opened commercial premises and now has 300 clients.

She is now planning to open 10 more franchises across the US in early 2015.

She said: ‘Parents across the board tell me how much stronger their babies are and how alert they are and how soundly they’re sleeping and how much better they are eating.’

Amanda Blackwell, takes her six-month daughter Amelie three or four times a week and says despite the expense it is a price she is prepared to pay.

She said: ‘Certainly not everyone could afford it. I’m lucky enough to be able to do it.

‘For me, how calm she is has been worth all the money in the world.

‘As an adult, I love to go to the spa. Why don’t we teach our kids to enjoy serene environments more?

‘We stick them in chaotic environments like daycare or music class. Why not teach them to unwind.’
