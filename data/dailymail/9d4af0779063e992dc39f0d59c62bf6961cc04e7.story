Guilty: Former England cricketer Kim Barnett put a picture of his ex-wife beside an image of a witch in his car

A former England cricketer has been convicted of harassment after putting a picture of his ex-wife next to an image of a witch in his car.

Kim Barnett, 52, who played for Derbyshire and Gloucestershire, displayed the two pictures, with the slogan  ‘Which is Witch?' written alongside them, in full view of passers-by.

He was fined was fined £380 after pleading guilty to harassing his former partner Janet Barnett during August and September last year.

Mr Barnett, of Leek, Staffordshire, also admitted driving his car past his 
ex-wife’s home on several occasions despite being issued with a 
harassment warning in April last year.

Prosecutor Leanne Jones told magistrates sitting in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire that the retired cricketer, who played in four Test Matches for England in 1988 and 1989, had been suffering from mental health difficulties after the break-up of his marriage.

Defence solicitor David Green said Barnett, who separated from his wife in 2004 and went through divorce proceedings in 2010, retired from professional cricket in 2003 after a 25-year career.

Describing Barnett as a man of ‘impeccable’ character, Mr Green told the court: ‘It’s fair to say that Mr Barnett found the break-up extremely difficult to deal with.

‘These incidents occurred in the aftermath of the break-up and everything else that happened as a result of that.’

During his submissions, Mr Green stressed that the course of conduct admitted by Barnett did not involve any direct contact with his ex-wife.

The two images were seen in his vehicle by Mrs Barnett, who also lives in Leek, on both September 13 and 14 last year.

Addressing the ‘ill-thought out’ pictures placed in his client’s car, Mr Green added: ‘We have two incidents on two separate days which are in my submission quite bizarre, but also in some ways quite childish.’

Magistrates were told that the 
Professional Cricketers’ Association had supported Barnett through his 
health problems, which included a ‘stress-related’ heart attack in 2011.

It also emerged during the court hearing that Barnett, who works as a cricket coach, has no income during the winter months.

Barnett was also handed a two-year restraining order, under which he must not have direct or indirect contact with his former partner.

Chairman of the bench John Horton told the ex-cricketer: ‘We have taken into account all the circumstances of the offence to which you have pleaded guilty, and that you are a man of previous good character.

‘Because of the nature of the offence it fell very close to being a community order, but we have decided to deal with you by way of a financial penalty.’
