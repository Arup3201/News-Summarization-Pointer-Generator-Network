The main house, a stunning seven-bedroom country home, boasts sweeping views out towards the Channel while the two other properties included in the price - a two-bedroom granite cottage and four-bedroom Scandinavian-style log house - mean that the new owner will have plenty of room for guests.

Country home: Plaisance, the main house, is a detached house which has been beautifully and thoughtfully restored and carefully maintained by the current owner

Rustic: This spacious country kitchen is one of two in the main house - the current owners use one of the rooms as a small chocolate factory

Life of luxury: The estate, which is on the market for £2.9million, boasts a heated pool which is tucked away in a quiet corner of the sprawling gardens

Living simply: Sark's 600 inhabitants are not allowed to own cars and must travel by bicycle, horse-drawn carriage or on foot. Pictured: The view from the main house

Spacious: One of the main house's three reception rooms, pictured, offers plenty of light while an ornate fireplace gives the space a touch of character

In a brochure advertising the estate, Strutt & Parker also drew attention to the 'numerous offshore fiscal advantages' that could be gained by living on the remote island, namely the absence of VAT, Income Tax, Capital Gains or Corporation Taxes.

It was originally listed at £3.95million - £1million more than it is currently - but has just had its price brought down.

Sark, the fourth biggest of the Channel 
Islands, is around 18 miles south of England. The island's 600 inhabitants are not allowed to own cars and no airport means that it can be tricky to get to.

The remote island can be 
reached by a one-hour ferry from Guernsey - which is a one-hour 
flight from London. Once there, visitors can explore the picturesque village - and surrounding dramatic cliffs - by bicycle, on foot - or by horse-drawn carriage.

The main house boasts a 
reception hall, drawing room, dining room, shower room and two kitchens - 
one that is currently used as a chocolate factory. It is set in large gardens and is just a short walk from the property's paddocks, large workshop, heated swimming pool and pool house.

Quaint cottage: This additional property sits in front of the main house and offers two bedrooms and a large studio space - as well as its own contained gardens

Grand: The main house will offer a perfect retreat for those looking to escape city life - and their taxes - with a move to the Channel Islands

Rural: Just a few minutes' stroll from the two properties is a Scandinavian-style log house, which boasts views over the coastline - a perfect place to watch the sun set

Breathtaking: The three rural properties offer stunning views in all directions of the dramatic nearby cliffs and the English Channel below

Local village: The estate is just a short walk from an array of restaurants, shops and small hotels, allowing the new owners to enjoy the best of country life

The house offers incredible views over its own land and out towards the sea. And the fact that it is close to the local village means that the new owner will still enjoy a rural atmosphere and a wonderful feeling of privacy without feeling too cut off.

In front of the main house there is a small detached granite cottage which offers two bedrooms, kitchen, living room, bathroom, boiler room, private patio and a large office/studio.

Just a few minutes' stroll from the two properties is a Scandinavian-style log house, which boasts views over the coastline - a perfect place to watch the sun set, according to Strutt & Parker.

It boasts four double bedrooms, an extensive open plan kitchen and living room, two separate bathrooms, cloakroom, utility room and a woodenveranda. The master bedroom also boasts a wonderful sea view balcony. Outside the property is surrounded by private gardens and leads straight out onto the cliffs.

Outdoor activities: A fisherman at work of the coast of Sark, which is the fourth largest Channel Island and about 18 miles south of England

Incredible views: The surrounding gardens are well cared for with open lawns leading down to the coast, as seen through this window in the main house

Traditional: One of Sark's 600 residents drives a horse-drawn carriage down one of the island's country roads, where cars are not allowed

Coastal beauty: The Scandinavian log house is surrounded by private gardens and leads straight out onto the cliffs, offering residents  breathtaking views

History: A cannon, mounted on a wooden cart, is perched on the clifftop just a short walk from the rural property
