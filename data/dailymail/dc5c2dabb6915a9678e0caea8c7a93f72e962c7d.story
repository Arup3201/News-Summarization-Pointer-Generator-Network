A U.S. Marine accused of killing a transgender Filipina appeared in court for the first time Friday to ask a court in the Philippines to downgrade his murder charge.

The Marine, Joseph Scott Pemberton, is being held at a
U.S. facility at the main Philippine army base — charged with the murder of Jennifer Laude who was found dead on Oct. 11 in a
hotel in Olongapo City, northwest of Manila.

Philippine government officials say Pemberton attacked Laude in a motel room after finding out she was a transgender woman.

She had apparently been strangled and drowned in a toilet bowl.

A handcuffed Pemberton appeared in court wearing a black
suit and striped tie.

He sat quietly, flanked by U.S. security
officers, as his lawyers asked the court to suspend proceedings in a standard trial tactic. 

The court is expected to decide Monday if a judge will grant Pemberton's request to soften his murder charge to homicide.

The murder charge, which requires premeditation, carries a maximum 40-year prison sentence, compared to 20 years for homicide.

Laude's sister, Marilou, had mixed emotions on seeing Pemberton for the first time.

'I wanted to ask him why he killed my brother,' said Marilou, whose transgender sibling was born Jeffrey eventually became Jennifer.

'I wanted to bang his head against the wall. I wanted to be angry, but I am also afraid.'

Pemberton remains in U.S. custody while his trial gets under way. On the right, he is transported to his U.S.-managed detention facility

The U.S. embassy this week rejected a foreign ministry
request to hand Pemberton to Philippine authorities, citing the
Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).

Legal rules on the treatment of erring servicemen are laid
out in the 1998 pact signed by Manila and Washington to allow
U.S. forces to hold military drills in the Philippines to test
the readiness of the allies.

A group of anti-U.S. activists gathered outside the
court to demand justice for Laude.

Dozens of news cameramen and
photographers also waited for Pemberton, who was brought to
court in a convoy of heavily-tinted SUVs.
