He is the man behind many of the world's most popular gadgets, from the iPhone to the Macbook - and his designs may have even ventured into a galaxy far, far away.

A new profile of Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive, claims he gave Star Wars director JJ Abrams advice on the weapons for the much anticipated movie.

It also reveals that Steve Jobs was aware of Apple's latest product, the Apple Watch, before his death, and and that in keeping with Ive's design philosophy, the firms new 'spaceship campus' will have floors that curve into walls.

Something new: A striking. sword shaped lightsaber emerges as the cloaked figure prepares to do battle. 

London-born designer Jonathan Ive is Apple's senior vice president of design.

Since 1996, he has been responsible for products including the iMac, which ultimately led to the design of the iPod, and more recently Sir Ive was behind the drastic redesign of iOS 7.

He was knighted in 2012.

Ive also leads the Human Interface (HI) software teams across the company.

Outside of Apple, Ive has designed products for charitable causes, including a Leica camera for a charity auction, and a Jaeger-LeCoultre sports watch for an AIDS-charity auction. 

Although the majority of his work is at Apple, Sir Jonathan has taken part is other projects - and is believed to have been behind the design of Eve, the female robot in the hit film wall-e

In 2001, he created a white polystyrene box to house a book by Paul Smith, and in 2013  worked with Marc Newson, who also helped design the Apple Watch, on a range of products for the Project Red auction - where an aluminium desk the pair worked on sold for $1.7 million.

In a rare interview, Sir Jonathan revealed to the New Yorker he has also helped shape the far future in a conversation with Star Wars director and friend J. J. Abrams.

Ive once sat next to J. J. Abrams at a boozy dinner party in New York, and made what Abrams recalled as 'very specific' suggestions about the design of lightsabres, it claims.

'It was just a conversation,' Ive told the magazine.

Although he'd said nothing about cross guards, he had made a case for unevenness

'I thought it would be interesting if it were less precise, and just a little bit more spitty

A redesigned weapon could be 'more analog and more primitive, and I think, in that way, somehow more ominous.'

The result of an ambitious $4.05 billion buyout that saw Disney acquire complete autonomy over the franchise from LucasFilm in November 2012, the hugely popular first trailer revealed a new weapon - a fiery new lightsabre, with a cross guard, and a resemblance to a burning crucifix.

Steve Jobs was aware of Apple's latest product, the Apple Watch, before his death, Ive said.

In  the interview, Ive also reveals the firm's secret office on Apple's Cupertino capmpus.

'The room is about three thousand square feet, though its outsized reputation has led it to be described as 'cavernous;

It ends in a glass wall, behind which stand three eight-foot-high computer-numerical-control (C.N.C.) milling machines that shape plastic and metal to produce models and prototype parts. 

Ive's small team of designers work 12 hour days, and when Ive designed the space he wanted these machines to be as integrated into the studio as noise and dust pollution allowed. 

'They make physical objects, and that is what we're doing,' he told his interviewer. 

'Steve was the most focused person I've met in my life. 

'It's terrifying that when you really truly focus, it seems a bit illegal. 

'You can achieve so much. 

'What focus means is saying no with every bone in your body to something you know is a good idea but you say no because you're focused on something else.

I remember talking to Steve Jobs and asked why he was perceived as harsh. 

'And I said couldn't we be more moderate? And he said why? And I said because I care about the team. 

'And he said: 'No Jony, you're just really vain. You just want people to like you. I'm surprised at you, because I thought you really held the work up as the most important and not how you are perceived by people.''

'People misunderstand Steve because he was so focused' 

Toward the end of his life, Jobs told Walter Isaacson, 'If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it's Jony. Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in and say, 'Hey, what do you think about this?' 

'He gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product. 

'And he understands that Apple is a product company. 

'He's not just a designer. That's why he works directly for me. He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me.' 

Ive also spoke at a special celebration of Jobs life, held on the lawn at Infinite Loop, Apple's office.

'Steve used to say to me—and he used to say this a lot—'Hey, Jony, here's a dopey idea.' 

'And sometimes they were: really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room, and they left us both completely silent. 

'Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones which, in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound.' Ive said to me, 'I couldn't be more mindful of him. 

'How could I not, given our personal relationship, and given that I'm still designing in the same place, at the same table, where I spent the last fifteen years with him sat next to me?' 

The Apple Watch was conceived 'close to Steve's death,' Ive said.
