The forensic expert who has scientifically forecasted how the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's little boy or girl could look said it is sure to be 'adorable'.

Washington based Joe Mullins has taken all the best features of the Royal couple and morphed them together.

And with their piercing blue eyes, clear complexion and Kate's thick dark locks, the child could be a Royal beauty.

But, boy or girl, it is unlikely to have the blonde hair of it's paternal grandmother, Diana Princess of Wales, he said.

Just like mum and dad? Artist Joe Mullins has generated images of how the couple's child could look. The boy shares 
William's thin hair and ears, but also his blue eyes and Kate's darker 
colouring. The girl shares Kate's beauty with a heart-shaped face, 
striking blue eyes, and long dark hair

Good looking: William and Kate are an attractive couple and Washington based 
artist Joe Mullins has used computer-generated imagery to show how their best features could combine in their child

Mr Mullins studied recent photographs of the couple and used the latest computer technology to predict how the child may look during their formative years.

If the couple have a son, the boy is expected to inherit many of William's features.

Mullins has included the famous Windsor ears and William's slightly receding hairline.

A daughter is predicted to closer resemble Kate, with a high forehead, heart shaped face and long brown hair.

The Windsor ears: If the couple have a son, artist Joe Mullins says he will inherit William's features, including his hairline and slightly large ears. But Mr Mullins has also imagined him with Kate's colouring and complexion. The controversial image bears little resemblance to the Prince as a baby (right)

There are some similarities between Mr Mullins' mock up of the couple's child as a girl (left) and Kate as a child (right), most markedly the face shape, piercing blue eyes, and rosy cheeks

In the past he has taken the faces of other well known couples and imagined how their children may look, and has carried out magazine work where he 'ages' celebrities such Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

But it seems some people are not so hopeful for the couple's offspring.

Popular website Morph Thing creator Charanjeet Kondal has taken William and Kate's more 'unique' features and morphed them into what they would look like combined.

And less flattering images are a far departure from the glossy American images released by Mr Mullins  - showing a child with thinner hair and slightly protruding ears.

While they are not as polished as those produced by the US artist, they do still bear a striking resemblance to the couple as children.

Less flattering: The British take on the couple's child uses some of their more unique features, but still has porcelain skin and deep blue eyes. This interpretation appears to bear more of a resemblance to William

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had been hoping to keep the news they were expecting a baby to themselves until Christmas Day.

But after Kate was admitted to hospital with extreme morning sickness, sparked by a rare condition called Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), they had little choice but to make the announcement.

Kate, 30, who is thought to be between six and eight weeks pregnant, was taken to the hospital just after lunch on Sunday by her husband and put on a drip to stop her becoming dehydrated.

But the news delighted millions around the world – including their own families. 

Sources say she appeared to be responding well to treatment and there was ‘no cause for alarm’.

However, doctors at the King Edward VII Hospital in central London have taken the precautionary step of keeping her in for the next few days.

Joe Mullins is a highly respected forensic artist based in Washington.

He
trained as a graphic designer before joining police doing both age 
progressions of missing children and facial reconstruction from the 
skull.

His work has helped trace countless missing children over the 11 years he has worked in forensics.

But when he is not hard at work in 
the serious day job, he enjoys creating 'fun but scientific forecasts' forecasting how celebrities will look when they are older and how their children might look.

Mr Mullins said he took recent 
pictures of the Duke and Duchess, and took account of their colouring, and 
predominant genes and outstanding features, such as Kate's olive skin, William's ears, and their clear complexions.

While he tries to make then as 'cute as possible' he says it is all highly scientific.

He said the future king or queen of 
England was bound to be 'adorable' and added: 'For Kate and William's 
baby - I think there is a lot of good genes in the mix there.

'There is a science behind the 
process. The darker features are more dominant with Kate's olive skin 
and dark hair.  I would say you are not going to get a fair skinned baby 
with blonde hair and blue eyes  - like Diana.'

He added: 'Over the years I have done lots of different celebrities.

'I did Jennifer Anniston and Brad Pitt when they were married and I have done a few of Angelina Jolie.

'When I did Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise I did the child as a boy, but the image actually does look a lot like Suri.

'My day job means I have acquired a skill which means it is always in the ball park.

'I was inspired after seeing some 
other versions of celebrities children that were done. I remember 
thinking 'those things look scary. I could do something more accurate.

'My interpretation of Kate Hudson's 
son Ryder Robinson (son from her first marriage to Black Crowes sinegr 
Chris Robinson) was pretty much spot on.

'It's all forensic art based on 
family hereditary going backward to make these fun baby images or 
forward to depict what children will look like now and get them back 
home to where they belong. '
