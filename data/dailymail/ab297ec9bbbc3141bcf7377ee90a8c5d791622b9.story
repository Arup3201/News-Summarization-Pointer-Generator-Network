No wonder Roy Keane packed his bags and left. If it was really frustration over Aston Villa’s alarming slump that persuaded the Irishman to quit as Paul Lambert’s assistant on the eve of this game, then there was ample evidence at Turf Moor to explain why.

This was a game Villa should have won. Yet they ended up hanging on for a point after Danny Ings’s 87th-minute penalty cancelled out Joe Cole’s first-half goal and set up a grandstand finish to a breathless, full-blooded encounter.

It is now nine games in a row without a win for Villa; six defeats followed by three straight draws. Cole’s goal, on his first Premier League start for the club, made him only Villa’s third goalscorer in the Premier League this season, and that highlights the root of their problems. 

But having got ahead against a Burnley team with their tails up after back-to-back wins, they really should have held on.

Their fans know it and added to Lambert’s problems by turning on their manager towards the end.

‘These guys pay their money, I’ve no problem with that,’ said Lambert. ‘That’s what can happen. It’s not nice to hear but that’s football.

‘For most of the game I was happy. I thought we were excellent. It’s the best we’ve played in a few weeks. 

'We should have been two or three up at half-time and some of the football we played was outstanding.’

He had a point. Villa started at a frantic pace and went close to taking the lead on several occasions before Cole struck six minutes before half-time, Dean Marney twice heading away goalbound efforts and goalkeeper Tom Heaton a busy man.

The breakthrough came after a flashpoint following Marney’s late lunge on Ciaran Clark deep in the Villa half.

Goalkeeper Brad Guzan pumped a freekick forward and Dave Jones could only head the ball onwards to Andreas Weimann on the right. 

The Austrian slid a pass towards the edge of the six-yard box where Michael Keane was playing Cole onside and the former England star did not hesitate, turning to steer the ball inside Heaton’s near post.

It was Cole’s first goal since last December. ‘I wish Joe Cole had come here five years ago but I couldn’t afford him,’ lamented Lambert. 

Knowing that a win would see Villa replace them in the relegation zone, Burnley stepped up the pace in the second half with Michael Kightly firing their best chance straight at Guzan from close range.

It was Cole’s first goal since last December. ‘I wish Joe Cole had come here five years ago but I couldn’t afford him,’ lamented Lambert. 

Knowing that a win would see Villa replace them in the relegation zone, Burnley stepped up the pace in the second half with Michael Kightly firing their best chance straight at Guzan from close range. 

And when Jores Okore was penalised for dragging down substitute Lukas Jutziewicz late on, Ings stepped up to convert his fourth goal in five games.

There was still time in five added minutes for Ings to prod the ball agonisingly against the post and Jutkiewizc to head inches wide as Villa clung on. 

Keane will be more than happy that he wasn’t here to see it.

‘In the end with the chances we created, you’re scratching your head how we didn’t win,’ said Burnley boss Sean Dyche. 

‘But take away the last eight minutes and it was a real close affair.

‘It’s a great sign of what we want to achieve that we come away disappointed after not beating Aston Villa after being a goal down. 

'But Villa are certainly not a team that are broken, I’m sure of that.’
