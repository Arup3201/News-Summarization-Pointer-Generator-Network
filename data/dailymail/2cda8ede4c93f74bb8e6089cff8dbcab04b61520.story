What better place to hold a black tie event than the beach? 

At least that's what these 200 revellers thought when they dressed in their finery - only to run into the sea and get covered in sand at New York's Coney Island beach.

The  event was organised by New York-based group Improv Everywhere, whose website boasts: 'We cause scenes.' 

It made a bizarre spectacle as women clad in expensive ball gowns lifted their skirts and ran into the waves as regular swimmers gawked at the debauchery.

And men ripped off their bow ties and cummerbunds and threw top hats in the air as they ran full pelt into the water.

Some had even come prepared for the beach party, wearing inflatable arm bands over their dinner jackets, while other stripped down to swimming trunks.

But what party is complete with without the age-old favourite - the conga?

Revellers formed a line and danced energetically in the water before going back to the beach to make sandcastles. 

Improv Everywhere organise 'scenes of chaos and joy in public places' in the US.
