Stefanie Janikiewicz drove the wrong way down a motorway. She told police she thought she was driving in the opposite direction

He is an expert in alcohol and drug abuse and a leading light in the campaign to introduce a minimum price per unit. 

So when Dr Stefan Janikiewicz’s daughter was hauled before the courts for driving the wrong way down a motorway while drunk he had more reason that most to be embarrassed.

‘The irony is not lost on me,’ the clinical director for drug and alcohol services within Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Trust said.

His daughter Stefanie, 25, had been on a cocktail and wine binge and was nearly three times the limit when she drove for seven miles along the hard shoulder.

When she was eventually stopped she stunned police by saying she thought she was travelling in completely the opposite direction.

She could have faced up to two years behind bars after admitting charges of dangerous driving and drink driving.

On Wednesday, at Preston Crown Court, the teacher, from Thurstaston on the Wirral, escaped with a six-month sentence suspended for 18 months.

Judge Anthony Russell QC – who controversially gave paedophile TV presenter Stuart Hall a 15-month prison term for sex offences – said she could go free because she was a popular teacher with a previously impeccable character.

She was banned from driving for two years and ordered to pay £350 costs.

Dr Janikiewicz, 64, who is also an expert in substance misuse at the Royal College of General Practitioners in North West England, was the first GP to head up a major drug treatment unit in England.

He has been an ardent campaigner for the introduction of a minimum price per unit of alcohol.

Yesterday he said: ‘The last few weeks have been dreadful, but much more so as a father.

‘My wife and I have eight children so I suppose statistically an awful situation would arise in some area, and it was in the field where I am meant to be an expert and I have not been able to reinforce that on my own children.

‘But it has not changed the advice I give, it has only served to reinforce it.’

The incident occurred in May after Miss Janikiewicz travelled from London to Manchester and had been drinking on the train.

She then went for an evening meal with her sister and drank more alcohol before setting off in her Nissan Micra to speak with her ex-boyfriend in Liverpool.

However she ended up heading 55 miles in the opposite direction, towards Blackpool, on the wrong side of the carriageway.

She was spotted travelling at a walking pace along the M55 by concerned motorists.

Miss Janikiewicz drove on the hard shoulder for almost 40 minutes. Her father has campaigned for the introduction of a minimum price per unit of alcohol. He said his daughter's actions has 'not changed the advice I give, it has only served to reinforce it'

Much of Miss Janikiewicz’s 38-minute journey was along the hard shoulder and she admitted having had so much to drink she could not remember what she had done.

The court heard Miss Janikiewicz works for a charity called Teach First, which trains graduates to work in deprived areas.

Carole Whittingham, of the Campaign Against Drink Driving, said: ‘This woman is a role model to young people. What sort of message does the sentence send?’

Dr Janikiewicz said: ‘As parents you love your children to such a degree you will support them no matter what. But… it was absolutely abhorrent on her part and I regret it, she regrets it. Her remorse is total.’
