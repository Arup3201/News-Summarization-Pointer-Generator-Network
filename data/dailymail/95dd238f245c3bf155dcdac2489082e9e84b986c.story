The Budweiser tycoon whose model girlfriend died at his mansion in 2010 from a drug overdose has settled a wrongful death suit with her family for $1.75million.

Aspiring model Adrienne Martin, 27, was found dead just before Christmas in the bed of August Busch IV, the former chief of the Anheuser-Busch beer empire.

Miss Martin, who had been dating 46-year-old Mr Busch for two years, died on December 19 after taking a lethal mixture of cocaine and the painkiller oxycodone. Today a judge approved the settlement before the parties - who have been locked in a longstanding legal wrangling - went to a contentious hearing next month.

According to STL Today, Martin's ex-husband Dr Kevin Martin sued Busch on behalf of their young son, Blake, in March of 2011.  Adrienne Martin's divorced parents, Larry Eby and Christine Trampler, then successfully appealed to join the lawsuit. 

Busch's attorney, St Louis lawyer Maurice Graham, released a statement this morning saying: 'Mr Busch cares deeply for Adrienne's son, Blake Martin, and is happy this long and at times bitter legal dispute is finally over.

'The only remaining issue was the division of the total settlement of $1.75 million. August's concern was that Blake receive as much of the total settlement as possible. Importantly, the dispute was resolved amicably today allowing everyone to avoid the contested hearing scheduled for November 14. August hopes to remain an important part of Blake's life.'

According to the agreement, Blake Martin will be paid $1.35 million, Christine Trampler agreed to accept $200,000 and Larry Eby agreed to a $200,000 out-of-court settlement, which was put into an annuity for his grandson. 

Dreams: Miss Martin was an aspiring model

No charges were made in Miss Martin's death, despite the levels of cocaine and oxycodone being high enough to kill her, an autopsy found.

A Medical Examiner concluded the former Hooters waitress had voluntarily taken the drugs so no one was held accountable.

Last year, the beer tycoon offered the family $1.5million to settle the wrongful death claim.

An attorney for Busch said at the time the offer had been made to provide for Blake's future and insisted the decision was not an admission of wrongdoing.

Miss Martin, who suffered from an electrical heart condition known as Long QT syndrome, was due to start work at an energy firm before she died.

Busch, 46, was the last member of his family to run Anheuser-Busch brewing, between 2006 to 2008, before it was sold to Belgian brewer InBev.

The 2008 sale earned the heir about $100 million. He has since said he will step down from the company's board of directors, marking the end of the family's involvement in the brewery, the largest in the world.

The tycoon has a troubled past. In 1983, Busch, then a 20-year-old University of Arizona student, left a bar with a 22-year-old woman.

His black Corvette crashed and the woman, Michele Frederick, was killed. Busch was found hours later at his home. He suffered a fractured skull and claimed he had amnesia.

After a seven-month investigation, authorities declined to press criminal charges, citing a lack of evidence.

Two years later Mr Busch was acquitted of assault charges by a jury in St Louis after he was involved in a police chase.

The great-great-grandson of Anheuser-Busch founder Adolphus Busch has spoken in the past of the deep devastation he felt following the sudden death of his girlfriend.

'I went to serve her breakfast in bed, and I couldn't wake her up,' he said after Miss Martin's death. ‘It's the saddest thing I've ever dealt with.'
