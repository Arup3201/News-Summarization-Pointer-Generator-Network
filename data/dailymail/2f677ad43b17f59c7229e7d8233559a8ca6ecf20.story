Charlie Austin experienced the highs and lows of football in Queens Park Rangers' win against his former club Burnley – setting up one and scoring another before being sent off late on.

This win will be vital in QPR's chances of avoiding relegation this season and their moments of quality proved too much, with two moves which punctured a poor quality affair and punished their opponents.

The first goal on 51 minutes was a swift, passing move. Austin played a one-two with Bobby Zamora, whose return pass skilfully slipped in the striker. Austin committed a defender then passed into Leroy Fer who took a touch before finishing – the ball hitting Ben Mee and looping up agonisingly over Tom Heaton who had rushed from Burnley's goal.

A single strike did not look like winning the match but Austin finished off his former club by finishing off another fine move with 15 minutes to play. This time Eduardo Vargas exchanged passes with Mauricio Isla on the right, then cut the ball back to Austin who buried a low strike.

It was a fine display from QPR's top scorer, until he was sent off two minutes later. Already on a yellow card for a late challenge on Kieran Trippier, Austin led with an elbow to contest a ball and caught Michael Keane. Referee Jonathan Moss did not hesitate to book him again and produce a red.

Manager Harry Redknapp agreed that the two yellow cards were warranted, but added: 'He is not a nasty type of player at all. He was trying to defend and put shift in. He scored again which is great for us.'

This fixture at Loftus Road last season in the Championship was 3-3, described by Joey Barton in the match-day programme as a 'ding-dong' affair. A few more displays like this and Burnley will be back there next season.

Surprisingly, the visitors were the dominant side of the first half and QPR relied on goalkeeper Rob Green, extending his fine form of recent weeks, to keep the score level.

On 12 minutes he was, admittedly, at fault when he dropped Dean Marney's cross straight into the path of Scott Arfield, but his reactions to dive to his left to stop the follow-up effort were lightning.

He was tested once more just before the half-hour mark. The ball came back out from a Burnley corner to George Boyd, who hit a swerving drive from 25-yards which was curving into the top right corner until the QPR goalkeeper tipped it on to the right post.

'That was top corner all the way,' Redknapp said. 'I was behind it and as soon as he hit it I said, “That's in.” How he got his fingertips to that I don't know. He's a great keeper. You go one down and it takes the momentum away, he kept us in it at 0-0.'

QPR suddenly realised they were playing at home to a side who they need to be beating if they want any chance of staying in the top flight.

Vargas carved out a chance for himself, running down the right flank and cutting inside before beating Heaton with a low shot only to see defender Keane block on the line.

As the whistle went for half-time two teams traipsed off who knew how crucial the next 45 minutes could be to defining their season.

It was Harry Redknapp's side who took the initiative early in the second half with Fer's strike, but Burnley would not lie down.

Six minutes after they went behind, Boyd flashed a ball across the box from the left-hand side and Barnes was there at the back post of a tap-in only for Richard Dunne to stick out a leg and somehow not send the ball into his own net.

Then Danny Ings sent a back-post header inches wide of the left post, teed up by a deep cross from the right by Marney. 

Burnley manager Sean Dyche said: 'Green's made a worldy save. We need to be more clinical. We have been earlier in the season and we weren't enough against QPR.

'The performance was good, there was organisation, energy, quality, we're putting in the right mixture but we need to win games. We have to turn that into wins.'

For all Burnley's endeavour, the game was finally sealed when Austin struck – and only his foolishness late on stopped him fully revelling in the victory.
