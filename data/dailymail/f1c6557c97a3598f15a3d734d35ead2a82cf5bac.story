Celtic boss Ronny Deila has cleared Lukasz Zaluska of all blame after the Polish goalkeeper was allegedly assaulted in the street by another Scottish Premiership player on Monday night.

Zaluska had been out for a meal with his wife and a friend in Glasgow’s fashionable West End when the incident is said to have occurred.

And on Wednesday night Dundee United released a statement revealing they have commenced an internal investigation into the conduct of two of their players following information received by the club. They refused to make any further comment.

Goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska, sporting a black eye, is put through his paces in training earlier this week

Despite being taken to hospital for medical attention after suffering facial bruising, the 32-year-old trained at Lennoxtown this week and is set to take his place in the squad which faces Romanians Astra Giurgiu in the Europa League at Parkhead on Thursday. 

Speaking about the matter before the Tannadice club’s statement was released, Deila said he had no issue whatsoever with his player socialising on the night in question.

And the Norwegian was convinced his player had absolutely no reason to reproach himself for anything that had happened.

‘He is fine,’ Deila declared. ‘Of course he was a bit scared about this but everything is good now. He has trained well the last couple of days, so he is ready for tomorrow.

‘I talked to him, of course, about what happened. It is a police case now, I hope they can make it right and we just have to wait and see.

‘He hasn’t done anything wrong from our perspective. We just have to support him and, of course, we feel sorry for him because that is a hard thing to go through.’

Deila has taken a hard-line approach to the fitness and diet of his players since being unveiled as Celtic manager. But he was adamant yesterday that he has no issue whatsoever with any of his players socialising when their training schedule permits.

‘It is not a problem if they want to go out for dinner and do something social,’ he added.

‘Of course that is okay. He hasn’t done anything wrong. He was out for dinner and that is perfectly right. That’s why you get frightened about this, it’s not fun to experience things like that and we have to take care of him.

‘If this was happening a lot of times, I would have to do something but I think this is a one-time situation, hopefully. You learn by experiences.

Kris Commons, who missed the league win over Ross County, remains doubtful through injury 

‘You have to understand the life that you have in that city. They (the players) are role models and that is important to think about - but it is a police case and we will see what happens.’

Craig Gordon is likely to retain his place in goal, with full-back Emilio Izaguirre also in contention despite being stretchered off in the 5-0 victory against Ross County last Saturday following a challenge by Michael Gardyne. But Kris Commons, who missed the league victory in the Highlands, is still doubtful through injury.

Astra have failed to take a point from their opening games with Dinamo Zagreb and Red Bull Salzburg and there is a growing expectation that Celtic could go on to top their group if they secure two wins from the double header to hit the 10-point mark.

However, boss Deila insisted that the side who finished second in their domestic league last season, and knocked Lyon out of the Europa League on their way to a place in Group D, should not be taken lightly.

‘They would be in the top three teams in Scotland,’ he stressed. ‘They are not a bad team.

‘The richest man in Romania has them and I played against them in January (when he was boss of Stromsgodset in the Copa del Sol tournament) and they have some quality players there.

‘But if you look at the group, you see that they don’t have any points yet and that is a sign they may be a little bit weaker than Salzburg and Zagreb but those two teams are very good.’
