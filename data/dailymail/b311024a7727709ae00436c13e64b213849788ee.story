Castleford are confident of taking more than 20,000 fans to Wembley for their first Challenge Cup final appearance for 22 years.

Ticket sales passed the 70,000 mark on Wednesday, raising the prospect of a sell-out for the derby showdown between Leeds and the Tigers on Saturday week.

Castleford, whose home crowds average around 7,000 this year, are hoping to win the trophy for the first time since 82,134 watched them beat Hull KR 15-14 in another all-Yorkshire final in 1986.

'The club took 20,000 that day and I think we'll take more this year,' said Castleford chief executive Steve Gill. 'I think we're well ahead of Leeds in tickets sales.'

Rugby Football League marketing director Mark Foster said: 'This is one of the most eagerly-anticipated finals in a very long time.

'The demand to see this event has been so high that we have had to employ extra ticketing staff to cope with demand.

'Tickets in the lower tier of the stadium are very nearly sold out, with less than 500 remaining, so we would urge fans to purchase their tickets now to avoid disappointment.'
