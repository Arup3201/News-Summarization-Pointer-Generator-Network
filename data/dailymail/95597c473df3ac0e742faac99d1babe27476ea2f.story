Everton ended a run of four games without a win as QPR endured another miserable away day.

Rangers have yet to pick up a single point away from home this season and never looked likely to end that sequence at Goodison Park once Ross Barkley put Everton on the way to a 3-1 victory in the 33rd minute.

Sportsmail's Dan Ripley rated the players' performances at Goodison Park on Monday night.

Everton (4-2-3-1)

Tim Howard 6

Rarely tested but was still beaten after parrying low Mutch strike straight into path of Zamora to stab home.

Seamus Coleman 7

A constant threat down the right and was rarely put under any defensive pressure as he attacked with freedom.

Phil Jagielka 7

Didn't give the QPR attackers a sniff in the first half and did well to control Zamora after striker's introduction.

Everton midfielder Ross Barkley was eager to impress against QPR

Sylvain Distin 6.5

One day short of his 37th birthday but still showed he can compete at the top level even if his pace has gone.

Leighton Baines 6.5

Not his finest game on the left flank, with Coleman doing more of the attacking work on the opposite wing. Booked.

Muhamed Besic 7.5

Helped Everton get on top in the midfield with a number of robust but fair tackles. Passing also up to a high standard.

Ross Barkley 8

Scored Everton's opener with a stunning strike and continues to develop at a promising rate after playing in deeper role. 

Muhamed Besic helped Everton boss the midfield with some strong challenges

Aidan McGeady 7

Hit and miss on the wing but delivered a fine cross to the far post for Naismith to score third goal.

Steven Naismith 7

Second half header helped put Everton out of sight even if he struggled to link the midfield with Lukaku.

Kevin Mirallas 7

Scored fortunate free-kick and his runs were difficult for QPR to defend. Went down easily in Hoops' box following Dunne challenge.

Romelu Lukaku 6

Hardly contributed anything on the pitch throughout the entire evening. Failed to have a single shot on target.

Subs 

Steven Pienaar (for McGeady 73) 6.5

Introduced as sub and immediately got involved, but Everton were already in second gear by the time he came on.

Samuel Eto’o (for Lukaku 77) 6.5

Did more in 13 minutes than Lukaku did in 90. Struck post with fine strike across goal late on after combining with Kone.

Arouna Kone (for Mirallas 90)

Everton's Aidan McGeady (left) delivered superb cross to the far post for Steven Naismith to score

Subs not used

Robles, Stones, Garbutt, Alcaraz

Roberto Martinez 7

Man of the match

Ross Barkley

QPR (4-5-1)

Rob Green 5

Unlucky for first two goals, but his poor kicking throughout the game proved costly as Everton capitalised with third strike.

Mauricio Isla 5.5

Managed to compete with Baines but never got the upper hand on the Everton full-back despite creating a couple of chances.

Richard Dunne 5.5

Subject of a controversial penalty shout after nudging over Mirallas but did help keep Lukaku quiet and starved the striker of service.

Nedum Onuoha 5

Unfortunate to score own goal following Naismith's header. Made 10 clearances but still part of a defence which shipped three goals.

Yun Suk-Young 5

Run ragged by Coleman and looked uncomfortable on the ball as Everton constantly pressed the full-back in possession.

Matt Phillips 5

Hardly got involved and only notable contribution was to fire well over bar in first half before being replaced by Zamora.

Joey Barton 6

His needless foul on Naismith led to free-kick which Mirallas scored from, but midfielder battled well for the Hoops.

Leroy Fer 5.5

Forceful in the tackle but wayward in his shooting. Hauled off for the more attack minded Kranjcar late on.

Jordan Mutch 5.5

Shot led to QPR's consolation strike, but he had already missed one good chance and dangerous tackle on Mirallas was reckless.

Junior Hoilett 6.5

Always an avenue in attack for QPR despite fading late on. Low-cut back led to Zamora's goal 10 minutes from time.

Eduardo Vargas 4.5

Tough night as a false striker. Only goal scoring contribution came in own box in helping Mirallas free-kick deflect in for 2-0.

Eduardo Vargas struggled to impose himself as false striker form QPR

Subs 

Bobby Zamora (for Phillips 59) 6

Helped add substance in the QPR attack and was rewarded with first goal since May after pouncing on rebound.

Niko Kranjcar (for Fer 77) 5.5

Brought on to add creative flair but couldn't help sustain any QPR pressure as game petered out after Zamora goal. 

Subs not used

McCarthy, Ferdinand, Hill, Wright-Phillips, Henry
