The grave of a First World War soldier has been saved from destruction after it was swallowed up by a huge sinkhole.  

Private Francis Ryan fell victim to the flooding which hit Britain earlier this year, as his headstone was almost lost in the 20ft-deep sinkhole.  

But engineers from the Ministry of Defence have now succeeded in repairing the hole and restoring the cemetery to its original glory in time for the centenary of the Great War.  

Swallowed up: The grave of Private Francis Ryan was at risk from a 20ft-deep sinkhole

Saved: The MoD has now filled in the sinkhole and laid new turf over the affected area 

Private Ryan, from Ireland, died in 1915 aged 40 while serving with the 3rd Battalion, King's (Liverpool) Regiment.  

He was buried in Wales's only military cemetery, at Pembroke Dock in the south-west of the country, in the shade of a Scots pine.  

In February, a sinkhole was caused by natural water erosion through the limestone beneath Private Ryan's grave.  

The 6ft-wide hole swallowed up Private Ryan's remains, leaving a tangle of rocks and tree roots visible.  

His headstone was thought to be in danger of falling in too, along with five other graves surrounding his.

Risk: Six graves nearest the sinkhole were fenced off to stop visitors from injuring themselves

Lost: Private Ryan's remains were swallowed up by the earth, but his headstone has been preserved 

MoD workers have now filled in the chasm and laid down fresh turf to make the graveyard look as good as new.  

A spokesman said the engineers avoided the disturbance of exhuming Private Ryan's remains, and filled the sinkhole with a clay-grout mixture.  

'It was necessary to close the cemetery in January last year for health and safety reasons after a grave collapsed - creating a large opening and damaging two adjacent graves,' she said.  

'An appropriate repair has now been carried out following detailed assessment work.  

'We were determined to see the graves restored in time to commemorate these men's sacrifice during the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.'  

Work: The engineers used a mixture of clay and grout to shore up the graves and preserve them

Pembroke Dock district parade marshal David Boswell added: 'I am very happy that they have saved Private Ryan's headstone from falling into the sinkhole.  

'They have filled the sinkhole in and covered it in a fresh piece of turf and it looks wonderful.  

'Now the public can return to the cemetery and pay their respects to the soldiers who gave their lives for their country.  

'We will be holding a service of remembrance in August to mark the centenary and we have the cemetery back to its best so we can remember our fallen.'  

The cemetery is the final resting place for 23 Commonwealth troops from the First World War and 51 from the Second World War.  

Pembroke Dock was formerly home to a number of Royal Navy ships, before becoming one of the major bases of the RAF.
