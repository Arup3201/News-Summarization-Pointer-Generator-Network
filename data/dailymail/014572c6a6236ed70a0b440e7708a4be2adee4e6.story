Calais officials are poised to start bulldozing the illegal migrant camps that have marred the town for more than a decade.

Yesterday it emerged that the Prefect of Calais has issued an ultimatum to migrants telling them to remove their belongings and evacuate by the end of the month or be forcibly ejected by riot police.

It comes as the Mayor of the port town opened the first purpose built accommodation for migrants since the closure of the notorious Sangatte centre in 2002.

The Jules Ferry Centre (pictured), currently houses 50 women and children and is preparing to house up to 20 more. The remaining 1,930 immigrants will be housed on wasteland next to it

Yesterday around 50 women and children became the first residents of the purpose-built Jules Ferry Centre with plans to accommodate up to 20 more.

Men will not be allowed to sleep there but will be allowed access during the day to make use of the showers and cooking facilities.

It is believed the French authorities plan to raze the illegal shanty town which has grown up around the town’s ferry port next Tuesday.

The land is owned by a chemical company Tioxide who succeeded in securing an eviction notice on the migrants last summer.

But since then the police have failed to move them on and the area has become blighted by rubbish and roughly improvised shelters causing fury among local French residents.

It is estimated that there are around 2,000 men, women and children sleeping rough in the town hoping to cross the channel into the UK.

Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, hopes the centre will allow authorities to get a grip on the situation which has plagued her town for months

Once cleared from their existing camps the migrants will be moved to an area of wasteland alongside the Jules Ferry site.

The town mayor Natacha Bouchart hopes the measure will help the authorities to gain control over the town’s chaotic migrant population and limit the influence of the people smugglers who exploit the desperation of those living in the filthy camps.

But yesterday critics feared the move would only exacerbate the problem with charity workers predicting it would take the women given beds an average of three months to sneak into the UK.

Gonzague Van Isacker from the charity Solid’R said: ‘The length of stay at this centre is expected to vary a lot.

‘Perhaps an average of three months for women without children before they manage to get to England.’

Jules Ferry, which has been converted from a former children’s holiday camp, will offer beds, food and hot showers to women and children on the basis that they are too ‘vulnerable’ to be sleeping rough.

Set in beautiful dune land next to massive WW2 German bunkers and beaches which afford stunning views of the Channel and the white cliffs of Dover, the centre is half an hour’s walk from the ferry terminal.

In addition to the Jules Ferry centre another ‘day’ shelter was also opened yesterday.

This will offer migrants showers and mobile phone chargers as well as serving 4,000 meals a day.

But the British government has long argued that such measures will only increase the numbers of displaced people congregating in the area with the aim of getting onto lorries crossing to Dover.

During the six years that Sangatte was open, it acted as stepping stone to Britain for an estimated 18,000 illegal immigrants and remains a source of bad feeling between Britain and France.

Conservative MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the Home Affairs Committee, told MailOnline: ‘The French need to tackle illegal immigration themselves and not set up a camp convenient for for going to England.

The new centre has been dubbed Sangatte 2, named after a previous Red Cross centre (pictured) which housed migrants close to the French end of the Channel Tunnel until it was destroyed in 2002

‘The French signed up to open borders and now they are failing to properly deal with the consequences.

‘There is a danger that this camp will turn into a new Sangatte, with all the problems that entailed.’

Earlier this week Mayor Bouchart, 52, herself the daughter of eastern European migrants who settled in France, used a speech to European council to blame Britain for the lawlessness in Calais.

Speaking on Tuesday she said her town was ‘suffering the consequences of the custodial role Britain has imposed on us to guard its frontier on our territory.’

Relations between the neighbouring countries have steadily deteriorated over the last year over the problem of Calais.

Last summer mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured and has forced the French riot police to maintain an almost constant presence to keep the peace.

In October Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to pledge £12million to tighten security in Calais after 250 immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the Channel.

But last night regional Prefect Denis Robin denied this insisting the new shelters are ‘humanitarian gestures.’

He said: ‘Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels in Calais.’
