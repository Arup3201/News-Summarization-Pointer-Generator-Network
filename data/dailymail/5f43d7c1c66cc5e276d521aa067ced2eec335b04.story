An Australian mosquito has been found in Los Angeles, California, more than 13,000km from home.

Los Angeles County vector control officials said in a statement on Tuesday that the mosquito that goes by the nickname 'Aussie Mozzie' has been found in Monterey Park and nearby Montebello. 

The discovery of the ‘Aedes notoscriptus’ mosquito in California is the first time an Australian mosquito has been discovered in the U.S.  

The mosquito can transmit the non-fatal Barmah Forest and Ross River viruses to humans, though neither has ever been reported in the county. It also can give heartworm to dogs.

The insect's Australian identify was confirmed by scientists from the University of Sydney using pictures which showed its distinctive black-and-white stripes on its legs and body.

Clinical lecturer and mosquito researcher at the University of Sydney, Dr Cameron Webb, told Daily Mail Australia that mosquitoes appearing in other locations around the world have become an increasing problem.

'This is one of the most widespread mosquitoes in Australia and, as well as being a nuisance-biting pest,' Dr Webb said.

'We will never know for sure how they got to the US but these types of mosquitoes are found in urban areas - not one has been found in wetlands.

'Mosquitoes are often found in backyards and they prefer to lay their eggs in smaller containers of water.

'My theory is people could have moved their belongings, along with mosquito eggs found in them.

'Alternatively, in extreme cases, it could have been a group of them that have flown on a Sydney plane for instance and then flew off when they arrived there.

'But it could've been anything really - movement from a commercial kind of product like plants or industrial equipment, which carried their eggs overseas. But it's a remote chance - a remote possibility that could've happened.'

The zebra-striped mosquito has been known to transmit non-fatal Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses to people in Australia, which have influenza-like symptoms but neither has been reported in the country.

'Mosquitoes  have to bite someone first, to be able to catch the virus but the chances are really slim,' he said.

'We can't guarantee that someone would get a virus because it all depends who and what they're biting - people or animals who are carrying the disease.

'They are a risk to dogs and have known to spread heart-worms in Australia but if pet owners get their pets vaccinated, they have nothing to worry about and their pets would be safe.' 

The insect was initially captured in June in Montebello and Monterey Park, but officials were not able to confirm it until this week.

'It's great how this situation demonstrates how we were able to work with the US authorities through a quick email and some high resolution photographs to be able to identify the specimens,' Dr Webb said.

Dr Webb said: 'California is battling with another species - the 'yellow fever' (pictured) which I think is a higher concern that they should be looking at'

Dr Webb said he encourages people to empty out any containers that are filled with water in their backyard and use insect repellent spray at all times when  spending some time outside.

He added: ‘California are battling with two more different species - the 'yellow fever' season mosquito and 'Asian tiger' mosquito, which I think is a higher concern that they should be looking at.'

The  Asian tiger was first found in Southern California in 2011 and can carry more dangerous diseases, including the dengue fever, chikungunya, and viruses, and other diseases.

‘This situation has demonstrated a concern and reminder to the Australian authorities and they need to be mindful of how easy they’re being exported to other countries.

‘There have been reports of new discoveries of mosquitoes in countries like South-East Asia, Europe, and South Africa – so what’s stopping them from making their way here?' he said.
