The Georgia Supreme Court has overturned a murder conviction for man who beat his wife to death with a baseball bat because evidence of the woman having an affair wasn't allowed into the trial.

The court said Monday that evidence of James Lynn Jr.'s wife having an affair would have corroborated his testimony that the woman told him she was cheating on him just before she was killed.

Lynn, of Winder, admitted to killing Tonya Lynn and was sentenced to life without parole. He argued that he was guilty of voluntary manslaughter and was provoked.

Crime of passion? The Georgia Supreme court said Monday that evidence of James Lynn Jr.'s wife Tonya having an affair would have corroborated his testimony that the woman told him she was cheating on him just before she was killed

Officials say Lynn testified during his trial that the two were arguing in July 2011 when Tonya Lynn told him that she was cheating on him with a former lover and a co-worker.

'We think that proof that Tonya really was having affairs … would tend to make it more likely that she, just as (Lynn) testified, told him of those affairs in the minutes before he killed her,' read the opinion. 

'As such, proof of the recent affairs…is relevant in this case, and the trial court erred when it concluded otherwise.'

In Georgia, a slaying may be ruled as voluntary manslaughter if the killer 'acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person' reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Scene: Lynn dumped his wife down a 20 to 30 foot well and then tried convincing his family she'd run off

Tonya was found in the well about 20 to 30 feet below ground in July 2011.

Police had said they began investigating after relatives reported the 38-year-old woman missing after Lynn apparently sent his wife's niece a text message to make it appear that she'd run off.

Friends and family had become alarmed when the mother didn't show up for work at an Athens hospital.

An autopsy found that she died of injuries from blunt force trauma.

The couple had four children children together.

The case will now go back to Superior Court for a possible retrial.
