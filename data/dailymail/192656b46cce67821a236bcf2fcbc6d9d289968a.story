President Barack Obama on Monday paid an emotional tribute to those who have served in the nation's military, including one of the country's oldest veterans, 107-year-old Richard Overton.

'This is the life of one American veteran, living proud and strong in the land he helped keep free,' Obama said during a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery where he also laid a wreath.

Overton was among those in the audience for the outdoor ceremony on a crisp, sun-splashed Veterans Day. Earlier on, Overton and other veterans attended a breakfast at the White House.

Overton, of East Austin, Texas, is believed to be the oldest known U.S veteran of World War Two, according to USA Today.

His appearance was the highlight of the ceremony and the proud veteran received a standing ovation from the crowd.

Overton credits longevity to two habits -  'a tablespoon' of whiskey in his coffee every morning and smoking a dozen cigars a day. 

Though widowed 22 years ago he still lives in the house he built in Texas after the end of the war.

Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered in 1942 and saw action in the Pacific with the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion.

Obama elaborated on Overton's proud record to the crowd. 'He was there at Pearl Harbor when the battleships were still smoldering. He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima.'

The president added that Overton still rakes his own lawn and drives ladies in his neighborhood to church every Sunday.

'War's nothing to be into,' Overton told USA Today on Sunday. 'You don't want to go into the war if you don't have to.
But I had to go.

'I enjoyed it after I'd went and come 
back, but I didn't enjoy it when was over there. I had to do things I 
didn't want to do,' the veteran added.

All across the country on Monday, Americans celebrated the actions of those who have served in the military.

Veterans' parades and wreath laying ceremonies were held in towns and cities across the nation, while others dedicated time to quiet reflection at the grave of a loved one.

Obama used his remarks in Washington to remind the nation that thousands of service members are still at war in Afghanistan.

The war is expected to formally conclude at the end of next year, though the U.S. may keep a small footprint in the country.

As the Afghan war comes to a close, Obama said the nation has a responsibility to ensure that the returning troops are the 'best cared-for and best respected veterans in the world.'

The country's obligations to those who served 'endure long after the battle ends,' he continued.

The president said the courage, self-sacrifice and devotion of veterans represent the American character at its best, and he encouraged everyone to honor every service member who has ever worn the country's uniforms.

Obama laid a wreath in a somber ceremony at Tomb of the Unknowns. Arlington National Cemetery contains the graves of over 400,000 American servicemen and women.

The president then made a speech honoring the 'patriots who have rendered the highest service any American can offer this nation.'

'They step up. They raise their hands. They take that oath. They put on the uniform and put their lives on the line,' he said.

'Because of their heroic service, the core of al Qaeda is on the path to defeat, our nation is more secure & our homeland is safer,' the president continued.
