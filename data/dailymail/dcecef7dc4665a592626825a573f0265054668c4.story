A Las Vegas teacher is being accused of racially profiling a Muslim student after she allegedly told the child to 'go back to Iraq.'

A father and son who didn't want to be identified said they were shocked by what the freshman's teacher said to him at Cimmaron-Memorial High School recently.

The concerned parent described how his son returned home from school March and immediately told him of the incident.

'His words to me, verbatim were, "My teacher told me that this is America, and if you can't stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in my class, you can go back to Iraq,"' the dad told KTNV News.

The young man, who was in a leg brace after a wrestling accident, said he had complained that he was in too much pain to stand during the pledge.

He said the teacher, who also hasn't been named, was aware of his injury.

But the student said he was singled out, even though other students remained in their seats.

'At first I didn't want to say anything because I was confused and I didn't know that a teacher would say something about that,' the child told KTNV.

The outraged father spoke to Cimmaron-Memorial's principal who said the teacher would be disciplined but did not say how.

In a statement the Clark County school district said: 'If appropriate, the district will take necessary administrative action.'

Witnesses: The teacher gave a differing account to school officials, but students who witnessed the exchange seemed to confirm the boy was telling the truth, including the student who wrote this note about the incident

'I felt his pain,' one student wrote in a note. 'I took offense of that. I knowtices (sic) that she called him a terrorist. I was very mad at what she said.

Meanwhile, the father insists his son was racially profiled.

'Our Islamic beliefs have nothing to do with our patriotism,' he told KTNV.
