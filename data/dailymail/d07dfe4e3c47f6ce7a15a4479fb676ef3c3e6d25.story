Tragic: Noah Pozner, pictured, was one of 20 six and seven-year-olds killed in last month's Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre

The heartbroken mother of Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner has opened up about the 'paralyzing' moment she learned her son was dead and revealed the six-year-old still comes to her in dreams.

'It was kind of like being told when you
wake up from a routine operation, "I'm sorry, but you're now paralyzed 
below the neck and you're going to have to learn to live for the rest of
your life like that,"' Veronique Pozner said.

Ponzer rushed to the Newtown elementary school from her job in nearby New Britain as soon as she heard reports about the shooting. When she arrived at the school she found her two daughters — seven-year-old Sophia and Noah's twin, Arielle — but Noah's class was unaccounted for.

As authorities investigated, parents waited. She said when she noticed clergy members among the families, she began to fear the worst.

'Just in my heart of hearts I knew something really bad had happened,' she said. She asked if it was a hostage situation. No. 'I asked them if it was a morgue up there,' she said.

After she was told Noah was one of the 26 shooting victims, she said she went into denial, thinking he was just hiding at school. Relatives and friends offered support. Visiting a makeshift memorial helped, too. She recently took her children out of town for a few days, and the family is getting counseling.

'But I find that grief finds me no matter how busy I keep,' she said. 'It's a very strange process. It just blindsides you when you least expect it.'

Pozner said her little boy also came to her in dreams. In one, the six-year-old brushes his teeth at the sink, his dark hair wet. He looks directly at his mother and says, 'Mommy, I'm having fun.'

In another, Pozner gives birth atop a
mountain, is handed the infant by a midwife and walks down a long 
flight of stairs back to a village. But she drops the baby.

'When I got to the bottom, the baby was dead,' Pozner said, crying.

Since the massacre last month, Pozner has struggled with the gaping hole left by the loss of her energetic, affectionate son.

'What's the alternative?' the 45-year-old oncology nurse told The Associated Press in an interview this week. 'Not getting out of bed? I don't think Noah would want to see me like that, although sometimes it is hard to get out of bed.'

She has tried to help her other children cope and make sense of the senseless. Noah was especially close to his twin, who escaped the shooting unharmed along with sister Sophia.

Arielle continues to talk about Noah in the present tense. Among donations the family received was a stuffed animal they call Noah bear.

'Every time Arielle hugs it, she says it doesn't feel anything like her brother, but she does enjoy having it around,' Pozner said.

Her children are filled with 
questions. Why did it happen? Where is the shooter now? Can he still 
hurt Noah and the other victims?

'I tell them, "Just like some people 
can be very sick in their bodies, some people can be very sick in their 
souls, and they don't think the same way other people do and they can't 
feel other people's pain,"' Pozner said.

She assures them the gunman can't bother Noah and the other children anymore.

She took her children back to school in neighboring Monroe this week for the first time since the shooting. On the drive, Sophia asked her not to play music on the radio because it makes her cry.

Pozner said she was reassured to see police at the school and believes such a presence can act as a deterrent.

She thinks gunman Adam Lanza's mother, who owned the weapons the 20-year-old used to kill 20 six and seven-year-olds and six staff members in the December 14 assault, was negligent.

'I think he had a mother who at best was blind; at worst aided and abetted him,' she said.

'Maybe she wanted to compensate for his feelings of inadequacy by letting him handle weapons of mass carnage and taking him to shooting ranges. I think there was gross irresponsibility, and I'd like to think that maybe she was just as unwell as he was to have allowed someone as obviously compromised as he was to have access.'

Those who knew Nancy Lanza have described her as a good, devoted mother.

To help move on from the tragedy, Ponzer is pushing for reforms from the White House. Her
family has submitted a detailed proposal to a White House task force, 
recommending a range of legal reforms including federal grants to review
security at public schools and requiring gun owners to lock weapons if 
mentally ill or dangerous people could access them otherwise.

Pozner also said it wasn't right that the law protects the release of any mental health information on the gunman. She said she planned to challenge that because it could shed light.

'Those are all answers that I feel that we're entitled to,' she said.

The family is suggesting a new law requiring people to notify police within 24 hours if they know about an imminent threat of harm or death made by a person who has access to guns or explosive devices.

'I've just been in deep admiration of her strength and her ability to try to do something positive and to try to make a difference out of what happened,' said Pozner's brother, Alexis Haller. 'She's an inspiration really for the whole family.'

Pozner said she is not ready to go back to work yet. These days, she has a tattoo near her wrist with angel wings and her son's name, his birth date of November 20, 2006, and the day he died, December 14, 2012.

'He was just a very expressive little boy,' Pozner said. 'He was just a bundle of energy.'

She thinks of her son's facial expressions, of him asking for a snack after school. Days before the massacre, he had come downstairs to see her shortly after being put to bed.

'I just wanted to give you one more hug,' Noah said. 'Why is your pajama top off?' his mother asked.'So I can feel your heart better,' he replied.
