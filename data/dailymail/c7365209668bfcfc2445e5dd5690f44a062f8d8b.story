Sebastien Pocognoli has risked the wrath of his manager Tony Pulis, after publicly stating his confusion at losing his place in the West Brom team.

The Belgian defender was an important player under Alan Irvine but since he left the club, the left back has found his game time limited.

Speaking to La Meuse, he admitted he couldn't get his head around the decisions being made.  

'I do not understand. I have also got no explanation as to why I don't play.

Sebastien Pocognoli (centre) says he's baffled by Tony Pulis' decision to drop him from the starting 11

'Even if my (left-back rival) is injured or suspended I don't get a chance. That's frustrating because I feel very happy in Birmingham and I have a good relationship with the fans.'

Pocognoli insists that he doesn't want to be one of the those players to throw a strop but may be forced to consider his long-term future.

He said: 'I will not cause trouble, because I am not that type, the end of the season is approaching and I am waiting for the club to tell me their plans.

'After I played 15 good games, I know that some clubs have followed me. It is too early to talk about that, but I want to stay in the Premier League.

'I have a good life here and at age 27 I think of everything. But I am also open to a new league.'

It's been a turbulent season for West Brom but has improved since Pulis took over from Alan Irvine
