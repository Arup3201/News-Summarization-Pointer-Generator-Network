A Chinese city is being fuelled by green energy, but not the kind that will stop global warming in a hurry. 

A power plant in Luoyang City, in Henan Province, central China, has started burning used bank notes to heat the city.

After getting permission from the People's Bank of China, the plant started burning damaged paper money to generate electricity for the city's 1.5million residents.

The plant claims that burning old notes is a more environmentally friendly than coal, and creates less air pollution.

One tonne of damaged money can contribute to generation of 660 kilowatt hours of electricity, the Xinhua news agency reports.

'With Henan's current unused paper money counted, the company can help generate 1.32 million kWh of electricity annually, which is equal to burning 4,000 tonnes of coal,' a spokesperson for the local People's Bank of China branch.

Yuan notes which are no longer deemed suitable for circulation is retrieved by the banks and handed over to the People's Bank of China for destruction.
