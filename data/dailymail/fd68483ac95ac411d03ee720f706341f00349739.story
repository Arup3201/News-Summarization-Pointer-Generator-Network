A Greek grandmother has been hailed a heroine after keeping her cool and putting her faith in the Lord when an earthquake struck, by simply crossing herself and praying while those around her fled in terror.

The powerful  6.4 magnitude quake hit the islands of Lemnos and Samothrace in the northern part of the Aegean Sea on Saturday rocking building and sending people rushing into the streets in panic.

But CCTV video shows grandmother Georgia Mirmoudi, 76, calmly sitting in a chair in a grocery shop, refusing to budge as the store manager and customers race for the door.

The fearless pensioner simply makes the sign of the cross repeatedly and starts to pray.

The camera can be seen shaking as the building vibrates but the old woman who was eventually left alone continues praying and looking completely unconcerned.

A few seconds after that the young man Nikolas Papadopoulos, 34, who spotted that she was still inside, ran back inside and hauled her to her feet, but she refused to be rushed.

When she drops her purse she pushes him away and turns back in order to pick up the purse. She then decides to sit down again and carries on with her prayers.

Once things were settled and the building had stopped shaking, she then got up and walked out telling those gathered in the middle of the street that they should have more faith in the Lord.

She said: 'I knew it would be okay. I wasn't worried. Today was not my day.'

Afterwards she said she was delighted at all the attention the video was getting if it encouraged people to take religion more seriously and realise the power that it had to help.

The 6.4 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast of northern Greece was felt as far away as neighbouring Turkey and Bulgaria but there were no reports of serious casualties or destruction, police and fire brigade officials said.

The mayor of Lemnos, Antonis Chatzidiamantis, said the quake had caused minor damage to shops and houses on the two islands but added: 'Almost like a miracle no one has been hurt, despite the fact that a 5.9 magnitude quake in 1999 killed 143 people.'

Greece, at the south-eastern end of Europe, is often buffeted by earthquakes and apparently the only person to be hurt was a British tourist who had been hit on the head by a lump of debris when a ceiling collapsed at an airport.
