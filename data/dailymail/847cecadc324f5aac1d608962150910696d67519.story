Andy Burnham has begun legal proceedings after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed he tried to ‘cover up’ NHS failings.

Labour’s health spokesman called in lawyers after allegations that while he was in power he attempted to suppress a report that exposed devastating lapses in hospital care. 

A party spokesman said Mr Burnham would not tolerate ‘slurs on his character’ and warned that formal legal action could follow – an extremely unusual step for high-profile politicians.

Threat: Andy Burnham brought in Labour’s lawyers after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt refused to retract an allegation that his Opposition shadow was involved the suppression of a critical report into 'failing' hospitals

Mr Hunt has refused to retract the 
comments he made on Twitter and last night refused to back down, 
releasing more evidence which he believes will undermine Mr Burnham’s 
claims.

He insisted there 
was still a ‘clear link’ between political pressure by Labour ministers 
while Mr Burnham was running the NHS and the failure to expose high 
death rates by health watchdog the Care Quality Commission.

Labour yesterday said Mr Hunt’s tweet had gone ‘a step too far’ and followed a long smear campaign.

‘This
is behaviour unbecoming of a secretary of state,’ said a spokesman. 
‘Andy Burnham is not prepared to accept these unfounded slurs on his 
character and the last government. He has therefore instructed lawyers 
to act on his behalf.’

The 
row erupted after emails were released under the Freedom of Information 
Act showing how Labour health ministers tried to stop details emerging 
of higher-than-normal death rates at Basildon and Thurrock University 
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Mr Burnham was recorded as being 
‘furious’ when the news leaked in November 2009, months before the 
general election.

Communications
showed the Department of Health ordered the CQC not to brief the press 
on an inspector’s report into the trust, which found appalling standards
of hygiene with blood on the curtains and chairs. But by then the CQC 
had already told three national newspapers.

Mr
Hunt seized on the emails last Friday and took to Twitter to denounce 
his Labour shadow. ‘Shocking revelations on Andy Burnham’s attempts to 
cover up failing hospitals,’ he wrote.

Mr
Burnham hit back, insisting the emails showed only that he was 
concerned that Department of Health and CQC disclosure rules had been 
broken and that he ‘ordered a press release’ after the story broke.

However,
allies of Mr Hunt say that Mr Burnham’s anger was not confined to the 
timing of the report and was more concerned with the political damage 
the revelations could do to Labour.

A
letter from Baroness Young, former chairman of the CQC, reveals that he
had taken issue with the tone of the press release. ‘It would be 
unfortunate if the CQC were to be judged on the timing or tone of one 
press release,’ she said.

And
the Tories said an email from the CQC’s director of engagement Jill 
Finney, said they had not ensured ‘the political implications were 
understood by ministers’.

A 
spokeswoman for Mr Hunt called for Mr Burnham to apologise. Julie Bailey
of campaign group Cure the NHS said the evidence of politically 
influenced cover-ups was ‘undeniable’ and said Mr Burnham should stop 
‘focusing on saving his own skin’.

Prof
Brian Jarman, an expert on hospital mortality, said: ‘I think there was
a sort of denial machine at the Department of Health in his time at the
department.’
