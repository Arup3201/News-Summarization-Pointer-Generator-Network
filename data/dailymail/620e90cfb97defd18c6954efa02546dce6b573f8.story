A cousin of Prince Philip has launched an astonishing attack on Princess Diana by accusing her of being 'spiteful' and 'unkind' towards Prince Charles.

Lady Pamela Hicks, who is the first cousin to Prince Philip, also said the ill-fated marriage 'absolutely destroyed' Prince Charles but said he had since blossomed again.

She also claimed Diana had no feelings for the rest of the Royal Family and did not wish to integrate herself into Royal life, instead preferring to listen to music and go to discos.

The daughter of Lord Mountbatten said Princess Diana did not try with her fellow Royals because she knew that the public admired her and claimed Diana believed 'she was the star'.

During the explosive interview with Vanity Fair, Lady Hicks and her sister Patricia, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, also make other revelations about the Royal Family.

They claim the Queen's parents were 'appalled' over the idea of her marrying Prince Philip, instead wishing she would marry a respectable English duke. They also say Prince Philip is more sensitive than people imagine.

Speaking about the marriage to Prince Charles, Lady Hicks, the mother of designer India Hicks, who was a bridesmaid of Princess Diana's wedding, said: 'She was really 
spiteful, really unkind to him — and, my God, he’s a man who needs 
support and encouragement. [The marriage] absolutely destroyed him.

'Now of course he’s blossomed again.'

Accusations:  Lady Hicks says his marriage to Princess Diana 'absolutely destroyed' Prince Charles

Lady Hicks, who was a member of Queen 
Elizabeth II’s 1947 bridal party, admitted that Diana was beautiful and 
had charisma but that she 'had no feeling at all for her husband or his 
family'.

She also suggested that Princess Diana made the public believe she was treated badly by the Royal family.

Calling this 'nonsense' she says Princess Diana was given the Queen's favourite lady-in-waiting. But she said Diana did not want to be told anything and instead wanted to listen to music and go to discos and concerts.

During the wide-ranging interview, Lady Hicks  - who has previously spoken about the recent history of the Royal family - also talks about the first signs of romance between the Queen and Prince Philip.

She told Vanity Fair that she had long
 known about a young Elizabeth’s crush on Philip and that the future 
Queen had first set eyes on her future husband at the age of 13 when she
 visited Dartmouth Naval College with 
her parents.

But Lady Hicks claimed when Princess Elizabeth reached a suitable age, the King 
and Queen were 'appalled' by the idea and instead wanted her to marry a 'respectable English duke.'

She claims one of the reasons was because a young Prince Philip had no money.

During the interview , Lady Hick's older sister Patricia, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, also speaks about Prince Philip.

They admit he has never been one to flatter but say he more sensitive 
than people imagine.

Lady Hicks has previously told of the moment the Press caught their first glimpse of a budding romance between a young Queen and Prince Philip.

She said: 'I was present when the world got the first inkling of their love for each other.

'It was my older sister Patricia’s wedding in October 1946, at which I was one of the bridesmaids, and the ceremony was at Romsey Abbey in Hampshire, close to our family home at Broadlands. It poured non-stop that day.

'When they reached the door of the Abbey, Princess Elizabeth turned to Philip and he casually reached over and took her coat.

'The watching Press glimpsed an air of ease and understanding between the pair, and royal gossip went into overdrive.'

Speaking before, Lady Pamela has told of her  mother Edwina's relationship with other men during her marriage to Lord Mountbatten

Writing in a memoir,  Lady Pamela said she  saw nothing untoward at first in her mother’s string of male friends. But in time, the ‘eccentricity’ of her family life would inevitably be a source of bewilderment and sadness.

She wrote that her mother's excuse for cavalier behaviour was that she was lonely. ‘My father’s naval duties often took him away, so she became increasingly reliant on admirers for entertainment.’

She called them her ‘ginks’, a slang 
word for ‘guys’, and she loved the thrill of being chased by them. ‘She 
began to collect them in a way that raised many eyebrows,’ Lady Pamela said.

‘Of course, the
 ramifications were messy and complex. When my father first heard that 
she had taken a lover, he was devastated. But eventually, using their 
reserves of deep mutual affection, my parents managed to negotiate a way
 through this crisis and found a modus vivendi.’

Princess Diana married  Prince Charles on July 29, 1981 at St Paul's Cathedral.

They had two sons, the princes William and Harry, before the couple divorced on 28 August 1996.

Princess Diana died after the Mercedes she was travelling in crashed in a tunnel in Paris, on August 31 1997.
