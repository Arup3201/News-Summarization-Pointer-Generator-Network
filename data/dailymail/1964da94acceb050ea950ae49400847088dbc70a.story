An engine casing that exploded on a Delta flight to the Dominican Republic forced the passenger jet to return to Minneapolis airport on Monday.

Dramatic pictures taken by a passenger show the casing ripped back to reveal the inner workings of one of the engines of the Boeing 737.

After noticing vibrations from the engine about an hour into the flight, the crew made an emergency return to Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport.

Shocking: A passenger took this picture of the snapped back casing, which exposed the engine of the Delta plane

The Boeing had been carrying 149 passengers on a 7.10am flight to Punta Cana in Dominican Republic when it was forced to turn back.

An emergency was declared to give the plane priority for landing when it reached the airport, though it had to circle for 25 minutes to get rid of excess fuel for safety reasons.

The crew were able to land safely, and the aircraft is currently being examined by technicians.

It is not clear what caused the casing, which is part of the engine cowling, to burst open, but aircraft experts said it is possible to continue to fly without it.

A Delta Air Lines spokesman said the crew had been following standard procedure when they made the decision to return after noticing the vibrations.

'These fellows did the right thing by 
immediately landing even though they knew there was no major danger,' 
Ross Aimer, chief executive of Aero 
Consulting Experts, told Fox 9 News.

He added: 'At that speed, sometimes that cowling - if it's not latched properly - would come apart.'

After their frightening ordeal and a three-hour delay, passengers were able to board a different plane to continue their journey.

The casings are not vital to aircraft security, but it is unusual for them to break free during a flight. A report by the National Transportation Safety Board in 2008 recorded 41 cases between 1992 and 2008.

The board suggested that checks to ensure the cowlings are attached properly may not be adequate enough.
