In court: Tabitha Gentry appeared today defending herself against charges of burglary, theft and trespass

A mother-of-six, who 'squatted' an east Memphis mansion for a week, told a court that she has a 'legal claim' to the property because she is heir via an anti-government sect.

Tabitha Gentry, who calls herself Abka Re Bey, appeared at the General Sessions Criminal Court Wednesday to present her own case against charges of burglary, theft and trespass, the Commercial Appeal reported.

The 33-year-old moved into the sprawling mansion in the Shady Grove neighborhood of Memphis last month with her six children aged between 11 years and 14 months.

In court she said she was an heir to the $3 million four-acre property as a citizen of the Moorish American National Republic.

The group does not recognize state or federal law.

'I have a lawful, legal claim,' Gentry told the courtroom according to the Appeal. 'I am the heir to this massive estate. They locked me up unlawfully.'

Gentry filed
papers with Shelby County Register’s Office claiming her right to the 
property before moving in.

General Sessions Criminal Court Judge Loyce Lambert-Ryan complimented Gentry on her questioning of law enforcement officers and a representative of the bank that owns the 10,000-square-foot mansion.

But then explained that her interpretation does not fit with the law.

Defense: Tabitha Gentry represented herself in court today

Expensive: This is the property Gentry moved into last month. In 2006, the residence, pictured in real estate photos, was bought for $3.9 million by Richard and April Rice

Repossessed: Renasant Bank assumed ownership in August 2011 and the home had been empty for more than a year

'Even though you felt you had done 
all that was required and sent notices to the bank that you were taking 
the property, the laws of the state of Tennessee do not recognize those 
beliefs,' said the judge.

'You’re not an heir apparent because you claim to be a Moorish National.'

The case was sent to grand jury but Gentry's bond was lowered to $50,000 from $2 million.

Last month the property's front gate 
was chained shut and five signs were put up saying 'Keep Out/Private 
Property' alongside a flag saying 'Moorish American National Republic'.

Family members of Gentry, originally 
from the Memphis suburb of Horn Lake, spoke out following her arrest 
blaming her involvement in the radical movement.

They said she was at one time an honor student and high school basketball player with a promising future.

‘Very smart. They said she was on the dean's list at school,’ cousin Trenisha Gentry told Myfoxmemphis.

‘She never went without making the honor roll or principal's list.’

They claim she fell in love with a member of the movement and soon changed her appearance and adopted a new name.

Her children have since been placed of the care of family members and the social services.

The home is owned by Renesant Bank after 
going into foreclosure in August 2011.

Claim: A note was placed on the gate of the property claiming ownership

Power: The home still had utilities but no furniture according to neighbors

At the time neighbors were outraged that the squatters had bedded into their exclusive neighborhood.

'Well, I'm stunned really,' David Peck told WMCTV.com.

'I know the two former owners. And I knew the house was on the market, but I've never heard of anything like this.'

Another neighbor, Vallie Jo Bell, said: 'We were just really surprised. I hope they'll get out and maybe find another place to live.'

Gentry was today also indicted on aggravated assault charges that were dismissed by a lower court when she failed to appear last year.

Police said she hit two officers with her car on October 9.

In contention: Gentry still claims she has a legitimate claim to the property

Angry: Neighbors were outraged that the squatters bedded in on their well-to-do street

Reclaimed: The property is now empty following Gentry's arrest
