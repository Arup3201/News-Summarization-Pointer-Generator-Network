Twenty-five people have been hospitalised after an Air Canada flight made a crash landing at Halifax Stanfield International Airport earlier this morning.

It has been reported the Airbus A320 crashed into a power line on landing, and then skidded off the runway.

The airline said a preliminary count showed Flight AC624 from Toronto had 132 passengers and five crew members, and had set out from Toronto Pearson International Airport.

The Airbus A320 skidded off the runway at the Halifax airport in bad weather, and 25 people were taken to a hospital for observation and treatment

It's no wonder why many passengers were treated for injuries as the force of impact was substantial

The crash landing caused extensive damage to the win and nose of the Air Canada plane

A passenger on the plane, Treasure Addison-Mills, speaking to NBC News said there were 'people with bloody faces', and that it 'took a long time being stranded on the runway with snow coming down.'

'We are thankful no serious injuries have been reported,' Halifax Stanfield International Airport tweeted. The airport said its airfield remained closed.

Another passenger on the flight Mike Magnus, a businessman, said the plane was at the 'furthest tip of the airport' when it stopped. He says he heard that the plane may have clipped a power line that caused the power outage at the airport.

'It was so chaotic at the time. I'm pretty sure the landing gear broke on it. The engine on my side popped off,' the 60-year-old  from Halifax.

The future running of the Air Canada plane could well be up for debate with the damage severe

Magnus believes at least one engine was torn off the Airbus A320. He says the nose of the plane was sheared off and he believes the wings were damaged too.

He added that the snow that covered the runway likely deadened any sparks that may have caused a fire and engulfed the plane.

'The snow caused it and the snow saved it,' he said.

Magnus was released from hospital after being treated for minor injuries to his shoulder and jaw.

'I'm safe and that's all that matters. I'm going to have a glass of wine,' he said.

Airport spokesman Peter Spurway said the aircraft touched down in stormy conditions.

'It came down pretty hard and then skidded off the runway,' Spurway said. He said he didn't know whether runway conditions played a role.

Passengers were ushered inside the terminal, where 25 were then taken to hospital

The rescue operation can now begin to remove the stricken Airbus A320 from the Halifax runway

It is possible the snow that covered the runway deadened any sparks that may have caused a fire and engulfed the plane

The Halifax region is currently under a snowfall warning, with an Environment Canada alert stating that 'visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.'

Power went off at the airport, which meant an emergency response centre had to be moved to a nearby hotel.

The cause of the outage was not clear, but Nova Scotia Power said they had since restored service. 

Flight tracking site Flightradar24 listed several cancelled flights at the airport Sunday morning.
