Part of Iceland was evacuated yesterday amid growing fears that the country’s Bardarbunga volcano is about to erupt.

Airlines were on high alert as the centre of the island was hit by an earthquake every minute, signalling increased seismic activity below the volcano.

If Bardarbunga erupts travel companies have been warned to prepare for a repeat of the chaos seen when Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano blew in 2010. A huge dust cloud shut down much of Europe’s airspace for six days, grounding 100,000 flights and affecting more than ten million people.

At around 
3am yesterday between 300 and 500 people, mostly visitors, were ordered 
to leave the highlands north of Bardarbunga, after 300 earthquakes shook
 the area in just three hours. Tourists have been banned from visiting 
the area, which is popular with hikers, and all roads are closed.

Authorities
 said an eruption might cause the Vatnajökull glacier – one of the 
largest in Europe – which covers the volcano, to melt, causing mass 
flooding.

Iceland’s 
Civil Protection Agency said: ‘It cannot be ruled out that the seismic 
activity in Bardarbunga could lead to a volcanic eruption. The area is 
now closed and has been evacuated.’

It added: 
‘These security measures have been taken since it would not be possible 
to evacuate the area in time should a sub-glacial outburst flood occur 
from Vatnajökull as a result of an eruption.’

Iceland issued a ‘code orange’ alert – the second highest risk level – to airlines on Tuesday, warning of possible disruption.

With 
millions of British families currently abroad for the summer holidays, 
and many more planning getaways for the Bank Holiday weekend, the chaos 
could be substantial.

However, 
the extent of the disruption depends on the wind direction during 
eruption. At the moment, the prevailing winds are blowing south-east, 
directly towards Britain. Forecasters in the UK are carefully monitoring
 weather systems in the area.

Laura Young, spokesman for the Met Office, said last night: ‘At the moment the air flow is coming from the north-west.

‘It looks 
like it will stay that way until the early hours of Monday, when we are 
expecting a change. If there is an eruption, it is all about timing. If 
the air flow changed it might not affect us or European airspace at 
all.’ Forecasting the wind direction is complicated because of the 
potential height of the dust cloud.

If the ash
 is blown 20,000ft into the air, as the Eyjafjallajokull plume was in 
2010, it would be affected by unpredictable air flows in the upper 
atmosphere.

At the moment the upper atmospheric winds are flowing in the same direction as surface winds, but that is not always the case.

Miss Young
 added: ‘The air moves around in different ways at various different 
levels in the atmosphere. We cannot second-guess exactly which direction
 any airflow in the upper atmosphere will change to.’

Einar 
Einarsson of the Icelandic Meteorological Office, said seismic activity 
was constant, adding: ‘It doesn’t seem to vary a lot – it is 
concentrated in one area under the glacier.’

Dr Nicolas
 Bellouin, an expert on atmospheric dust clouds at the University of 
Reading, said: ‘Volcanic ash is a hazard to aircraft, because of 
sandblasting of the outside of the plane and because particles are 
sucked into the turbines where they can melt and disable the engines.

‘For that reason, aviation authorities impose a limit on the maximum concentration of ash aircraft can fly through.’

But he 
added that a dust plume was ‘unlikely’ to have a dramatic effect on UK 
weather and that those with health conditions affected by pollution 
should not be ‘overly worried.'
