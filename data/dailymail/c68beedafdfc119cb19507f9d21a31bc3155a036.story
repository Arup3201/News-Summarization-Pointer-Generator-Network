They're Essex's most stylish sisters with a successful fashion boutique under their belts.

And now, Sam and Billie Faiers are getting set to tour the UK and give fashion fans a taste of their chic new designs.

Sam, 24, and Billie, 25, who are the proud owners of Minnies Boutique, will travel across the country to open pop-up shops in their favourite cities.

Speaking to FEMAIL as she shows off her post-baby body modelling the new range, Billie said: 'We are so happy to get back on the road to meet our fans. 

'We didn't do pop-up shops last year because I was having Nelly and it would have been too much to be out and about away from home.' 

Billie, who welcomed baby Nelly with her fiancé Greg Shepard last July, will be combining her role as a mother with her business duties by taking Nelly along for the ride.

'I will be bringing Nelly to one of the pop-up shops so she can see what goes on,' she said. 'Give her a few years and we will have her working the till!'.

Speaking about their brand, Billie said: 'We are really proud of how Minnies has grown, we both have our own projects but Minnies is something we do together as a family and we are really proud of how far we have gone.'

Billie, who also runs JAM Kidswear and has her own range of baby buggies with My Babiie, added: 'We are working on a top secret new project for Minnies which will take us to the next level. 

'All will be revealed soon.'
