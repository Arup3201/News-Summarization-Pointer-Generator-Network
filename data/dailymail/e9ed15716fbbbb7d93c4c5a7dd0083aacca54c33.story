Kerry Katona has revealed she is expecting her first child with fiancé George Kay.

The 33-year-old star, who already has four children from previous relationships, said in an interview on The Alan Titchmarsh Show that she is thrilled to be welcoming another addition to her brood.

She said: 'We’ve just found out we’re having a baby - I’m three months pregnant. I have food and a baby in my belly, the best friends in the world, a great job and I’m a very lucky girl. I’m very grateful.'

Kerry's announcement on the show, which airs on Thursday afternoon, came after she posted a somewhat cryptic tweet on Wednesday, writing: 'At this very moment... this very second right here... everything is PERFECT! I love my life!'

Kerry is already mother to 12-year-old Molly and 10-year-old Lilly-Sue with her first husband Brian McFadden, and six-year-old Heidi and five-year-old Max with second husband Mark Croft.

In an interview earlier this year, Kerry admitted she wasn't done having children, and wants to have another two babies with George.

'Me and my girls': Kerry also has two daughters, Molly and Lilly-Sue, from her previous marriage to Brian McFadden

She said: 'I’ve always wanted to have six kids, so another baby - or two - is definitely on the cards.'

The star was married to Westlife singer Brian for two years, 
before the relationship broke down in 2004 when he found love with 
Australian singer Delta Goodrem.

Kerry
then married Mark in 2007, before the pair called time on their tumultuous 
relationship in 2010.

The Atomic Kitten singer started dating former rugby player George, who was previously in prison for three and a half years for blackmail, in December last year.

However, the pair had been friends for years as they dated as teenagers, with George first popped the 
question in a Warrington nightclub when they were just 17.

Kerry has since described her rekindling of her relationship with George as 'fate'.

The news of Kerry's pregnancy comes just months after she was declared bankrupt for a second time. 

The mother-of-four filed a petition in Wigan County Court in July after struggling with money problems for the past 10 months.

Kerry and George also revealed that they had put their wedding plans on hold due to the bankruptcy.

She said at the time: 'There is no wedding at the moment because I have no money.

'Because we got engaged, people expect me to rush into it and get married straight away. But we are really happy and content. I’ve got an amazing ring on my finger and we will do it when I have enough pennies.'

Kerry was first made bankrupt in August 2008 after failing to deliver the final £82,000 of a £417,000 tax bill.
