Call: Environment secretary Owen Paterson will today call for Britain to lead the way in adopting GM foods

Children will go blind or die if the world does not embrace genetically modified crops Owen Paterson claimed today.

The Environment Secretary issued the controversial ultimatum as he claimed Britain could lead the way in producing GM food.

He claims it would lower prices and free up the countryside.

The Environment Secretary, a longstanding advocate of GM technology, claims its adoption in the UK could be as significant as the agricultural revolution.

But ahead of a major speech he claimed the decision to back the controversial technology is a matter of life and death.

He said 'golden rice' which could be grown in the world's poorest countries was first created in 1999 but had not been used to help solve global hunger.

'Now the World Health organisation estimates that up to 500,000 children go irreversibly blind a year, and 250,000 of those actually die.

'Now the problem is mainly in South-East Asia, but over the last 15 years, despite offering the seeds for free to those who would need them, every attempt to deploy this golden rice has been thwarted.

And in that time, seven million children have gone blind or died. I think all those who have thwarted the attempts to bring in this – for free, don’t forget – should really reflect.

'Those are real young people, and today, young people will wake up this morning able to see, and they’ll go to bed blind for life. Some of them will die today.'

In his speech Mr Paterson pointed out that since 1996 there has been a hundred-fold increase in the use of GM crops around the world, with 17million farmers in 28 countries now growing what critics have branded Frankenstein foods. Less than 0.1 per cent of this takes place in the EU.

'Farmers wouldn't grow these crops if
 they didn't benefit from doing so,' he argued.

'Governments 
wouldn't license these technologies if they didn't recognise the 
economic, environmental and public benefits.

'Consumers
 wouldn't buy these products if they didn't think they were safe and 
cost-effective. While the rest of the world is ploughing ahead and 
reaping the benefits of new technologies, Europe risks being left 
behind. We cannot afford to let that happen.

'The
 use of GM [technology] could be as transformative as the original 
agricultural revolution was. The UK should be at the forefront now, as 
it was then.'

Mr
 Paterson – who comes from a long line of farmers and tanners and keeps 
sheep, hens and horses at his country home in North Shropshire –  claims that GM farming can help feed people in poorer countries and 
inject missing vitamins into the diets of children in the UK.

In
 a speech designed to appeal to traditionalists, he also argued that
 using GM crops to improve yields will require less space, freeing up 
more greenfield land.

'If we use cultivated land more efficiently, we could free up space for biodiversity, nature and wilderness,' he said. He also argued that GM crops can help combat the effects of Britain's increasingly erratic climate.

In recent weeks the Prime Minister, the Government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Mark Walport, and the Science Minister, David Willetts, have all voiced support for GM crops.

Mr Paterson intends to lead a campaign among European ministers to make Brussels lift many of its restrictions on the use of GM technology.

He said: 'I am conscious of those who have concerns and who need reassurance on this matter. I recognise that we – government, industry, the scientific community and others – owe a duty to the British public to reassure them that GM is a safe, proven and beneficial innovation.'

Due to the speech's controversial content, the location where it was to be delivered was kept wraps last night to avoid it being hijacked by protesters.

Outlining what he will say, Mr 
Paterson told BBC Radio 4's Today show this morning that there was no 
evidence GM foods are harmful.

'The
 facts show that in other parts of the world GM is being adopted as 
normal practice. In 2012 there were 17 million farmers in 28 countries 
growing GM crops on 170 million hectares, that's 12 epr cent of the 
world's arable land or, very roughly, seven times the surface area of 
the whole of the UK.

'These
 crops are now established, they are part of normal life, they are part 
of normal agricultural production, they are part of people's everyday 
diets.'

He questioned the reason behind the highly charged debate about the use of GMOs.

'Is
 it emotion or is it evidence? There have been a whole raft of studies 
across the EU, there have been about 50 projects over the last 25 years 
on GM, 400 independent research groups.'

Peter Melchett of the Soil Association warned: 'We need 
farming that helps poorer African and Asian farmers produce food – not 
farming that helps [GM producers] Bayer, Syngenta and Monsanto produce 
profits.'
