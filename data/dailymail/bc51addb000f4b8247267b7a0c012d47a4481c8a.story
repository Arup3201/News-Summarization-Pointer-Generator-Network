Fiorentina winger Mohamed Salah, who joined the club on loan from Chelsea earlier this year, appears to be enjoying his new surroundings and celebrated with fans following La Viola's 3-0 win over Roma. 

The 22-year-old filmed himself with supporters gleefully singing his name as Fiorentina progressed to the quarter-finals of the Europa League.    

Salah had struggled to make an impact during his time in England and was readily used as a makeweight when the Blues signed Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina in January.

Since moving to Italy though, Salah has enjoyed a magnificent renaissance, scoring six goals and making two more in his last 10 games.

He has quickly become one of Fiorentina's most popular players and manager Vincenzo Montella has suggested  that the Italian side may have actually done better than Chelsea in the sale of Cuadrado.    

'Maybe right now we have got the better deal,' he told Mediaset Premium.
