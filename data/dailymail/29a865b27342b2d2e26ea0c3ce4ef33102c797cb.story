A 21-year-old schoolteacher has gone from Amish to stylish thanks to a dramatic makeover courtesy of a women's magazine.

Theodore Leaf, a celebrity stylist and Glamour Magazine’s beauty editor-at-large, has traveled to the tiny Amish enclave of Jamesport, Pennsylvania, to glam up a young woman named Sarah by giving her a brand new hairdo.

The 21-year-old teacher and housekeeper grew up in a small Amish community and has never colored or styled her hair, leaving her locks looking drab and permanently tucked underneath a small white bonnet for modesty.

'I’m definitely up for adventure... and doing my hair is definitely exciting,' Sarah says before her transformation gets under way.

In the video of Sarah's dramatic makeover released by Glamour Magazine on YouTube earlier this month as part of its series Bad Hair Day, Sarah explains to the stylist that most of the time she wears her tresses hidden from view, as dictated by her faith.

The only exception was when she did her rumpsringa - a rite of passage for Amish teenagers during which they are allowed to temporarily leave their community and experience the outside culture.

Cutting edge look: To give her lackluster tresses some movement and texture, Leaf gave Sarah a layered look

Amish blow dryer: Sarah lamented that she cannot blow-dry her hair because there is not electricity in her home  

Theodore Leaf, who also hosts a style show on LOGO-TV, tells Sarah he plans to color her hair - 'because blondes have more fun' - and add layers to give movement to her long-neglected locks.

While getting her hair dyed, Sarah confides in Leaf that not having electricity in her home is a major challenge because she is unable to use a blow-dryer.

Leaf advises Sarah to use foam to add wave and braid her hair before bedtime for texture.

‘Do you think there is a way to have an Amish blow dryer?' Sarah inquires.

In response, Leaf jokingly blows on her newly highlighted tresses while combing them out.

'I'll be done next year,' he quips.

Big reveal: Both Sarah and her Amish friend Laura (right) were left speechless by the schoolteacher's dramatic transformation  

All smiles: Sarah appeared to be very pleased with her beachy blonde, wavy tresses and ruby red lips 

She's impressed: Laura pronounced her friend's new, flirty look to be 'hot'   

The video of Sarah's makeover concludes with the big reveal when the new and improved Amish schoolmarm unveils her new look to her friend and co-worker, Laura, a fellow member of the Amish community.

When Sarah looks at herself in the mirror for the first time since the transformation, she appears stunned and overjoyed, exclaiming in delight: 'Oh, my stars!'

Gone is the bonnet and Sarah's flat, mousy wisps of hair. Instead, the 21-year-old is now sporting a mane of beachy blonde, layered hair, with ruby red lips and a light touch of makeup completing the picture.

'This look right here is hot!' concludes her Amish pal in admiration.
