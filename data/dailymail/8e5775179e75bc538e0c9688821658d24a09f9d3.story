A study found that adults believe foods to be healthier if they were advertised by loveable cartoon characters when they were young

He convinced us that a sugary cereal was ‘Grrreat’ as children. But Tony the Tiger and friends could still be affecting our views as adults.

A study found that adults believe foods to be healthier if they were advertised by loveable cartoon characters when they were young.

The researchers, from London’s City University, said that affectionate feelings for the likes Tony the Tiger, the ‘face’ of Kellogg’s Frosties, endure for decades.

As a result, we may believe the brands are healthier than they really are.

Paul Connell, of the University’s Cass Business School, said: ‘People should check the labels of products they’ve loved since childhood.

‘It’s possible that affectionate feelings for brand characters mean they are overlooking relevant nutritional information.’ 

Dr Connell began by asking almost 200 British adults how much they liked Tony the Tiger and fellow Kellogg’s mascot Coco the Monkey.

Tony the Tiger has featured in adverts for Frosties since the early 1950s, while Coco the Monkey only popped up in ads for Cocoa Pops in the mid-1980s.

The volunteers were also asked how healthy they believed the products to be.

Results revealed that the older adults – who would have seen Tony the Tiger but not Coco the Monkey as children -  believed the Frosties to be better for them than the Coco Pops.

However, younger adults, who would have seen both cartoon characters as children, rated the two cereals as being equally good for them.

The study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, also found that older, but not younger adults, held the tiger in more affection than the monkey.  

Further experiments showed that those with the fondest memories of cartoon characters resisted changing their minds. 

Other cartoon characters featured in the study included Ronald McDonald who has been used to promote the burger chain since the 1960s

Plus, a cartoon character’s influence is not limited to the food that was originally advertised – with a familiar face helping boost the perceived health of another product made by the same brand.

Other cartoon characters featured in the study included Ronald McDonald, who has been used to promote the burger chain since the 1960s.

The researchers said that our ability to understand and evaluate advertising increase with age.

As memories formed in childhood are particularly strong, adverts from that time may influence our beliefs for many years.

Dr Connell said: ‘We suggest that parents discuss the persuasive nature of advertising with their children, and encourage them to develop critical thinking skills in response to advertising messages. 

‘They may wish to point out that commercials use funny stories and exciting characters to entertain the viewer, but that commercials may not provide all the important information about the product. 

'For very young children, parents might want to limit the amount of advertising that their children see until the children are old enough to have these conversations.’
