Appearing on television isn't for everyone.

And it certainly wasn't the wish of this police officer, who suddenly realized he was in a live shot.

The unidentified officer was walking toward KTVI reporter Anthony Kiekow - who was covering an apartment blaze in Herculaneum, Missouri, at the time - when he caught sight of the camera.

He instantly froze in a crouched-down position, with his arms held down by his sides and his hands pointed out. He then stared at the camera for several seconds, before discretely sliding out of shot.

Realization: As soon as he caught sight of the camera, the unidentified officer immediately stopped walking

Still: He froze in a crouched-down position, with his arms held down by his sides and his hands pointed out

The hilarious moment - during which, Mr Kiekow continued his live broadcast unaware of the officer's faux pas - was captured on KTVI on Monday and later posted online by its sister station, Fox 13. 

On Monday evening, dozens of people across America were taking to social media to express their amusement at the footage, with some comparing the officer to 'a deer in the headlights'.

User Jessaa Arnold, from Pennsylvania, tweeted: 'OMG. I can't stop laughing at his reaction!', while a man named Scott, from the Missouri city of Jennings, wrote: 'Hahahaha! Too funny!'

Another added: 'This user's reaction when he realizes he's on live TV is so great.'

During the broadcast, Mr Kiekow told viewers that around 35 residents at Autumn Ridge Residential Care and Senior Living in Herculaneum had been transported to hospital following a blaze on-site.

Firefighters from almost 15 area departments responded to the two-alarm fire, which started shortly before 6am on Monday. No injuries were reported, but residents were treated for smoke inhalation.

Police are investigating the incident, according to Fox 2.
