Crackdown: U.S. diplomat Joseph Torsella, pictured, wants to end UN drunkenness

A top U.S. official has suggested a new reason for the failure of sensitive international negotiations - it could be because the participants are drunk.

The country's deputy ambassador to the United Nations is calling for a ban on excessive drinking during meetings designed to hammer out the budget.

There are reports that diplomats have been visibly drunk while serving on key committees - fuelled by the fact that the UN budget is usually fixed in late December.

But Joseph Torsella appeared to admit that the U.S. has in the past taken advantage of drunk negotiators to get its way without them noticing.

'We
make the modest proposal that the negotiating rooms should in the 
future be an inebriation-free zone,' Mr Torsella said yesterday in a 
speech aimed at reforming the UN's Fifth Committee, which manages the 
budget.

'While my 
government is truly grateful for the strategic opportunities presented 
by some recent past practices, letâ€™s save the champagne for toasting the
successful end of the session, and do some credit to the Fifth 
Committee's reputation in the process.'

Drinking
among UN diplomats is thought to be exacerbated around Christmas, when 
the budget is set - especially since the meetings frequently drag on 
late in to the night.

'We're not talking about a delegate having a nip at the bar,' one diplomat told Foreign Policy magazine, adding that had once seen a delegate drink so much he was sick.

Heavy drinkers? UN diplomats have been accused of drunkenness by a leading U.S. official

Ploy: Some have suggested heavy drinking is a deliberate negotiating tactic for some countries

Diplomats from the G77 group of emerging countries are said to be particularly prone to over-indulgence.

However, some have suggested that the heavy drinking is a deliberate ploy to stall the negotiations and avoid any change in the status quo.

As well as taking aim at the UN's drinking culture, Mr Torsella, who is the U.S. representative for 'management and reform', attacked other countries for blocking change by deploying tricks such as simply skipping meetings.

'If negotiators do not arrive on time for meetings scheduled on nights and weekends, or simply refuse to meet on a specific item in order to run down the clock, we must conclude that they do not share a commitment to negotiating in good faith, and we will respond accordingly,' he said.
