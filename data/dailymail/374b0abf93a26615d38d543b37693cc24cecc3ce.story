Unseasonably cool temperatures will arrive next week in the Midwest and as far south as Arkansas and Oklahoma.

It
 is not, however, the second coming of a polar vortex, a phrase the 
National Weather Service's Chicago office tweeted earlier this week to 
describe the upcoming sweater weather.

They quickly learned that wasn't 
such a good idea, said Amy Seeley, a weather service meteorologist who 
spent a good chunk of Friday morning fielding a flood of telephone calls
 from the media.

'I think people are pretty sensitive to those words,' she said.

Polar vortex: A cold front set to hit the Midwest next week is NOT another polar vortex, just unseasonably chilly weather

Cooling off: Six-year-old Chance Seeds runs through the water at the splash pad at McEuen Park in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho on Thursday. But the weather is set to turn chillier soon

Though
 Typhoon Neoguri has weakened since hitting Japan, it altered the path 
of the North Pacific jet stream, allowing polar air behind a trough of 
low pressure to spill out of Canada and into the Midwest, says Weather 
Underground meteorology director Jeff Masters.

It's similar to 
the polar vortex pattern from the winter that turned much of the country
 into a freezer for weeks at a time, breaking cold weather temperature 
records in numerous states. But there are key differences, Masters says.
 This air mass is coming from western Canada and not directly from the 
arctic, plus the polar vortex is not nearly as strong in the summer — 
and sometimes breaks down completely.

Between Monday and 
Wednesday, temperatures in the Midwest will be as much as 15 degrees 
cooler than normal, with the biggest drops seen close to the Great 
Lakes, though people in Oklahoma and Arkansas will need to break out 
pants, too.

Meanwhile, the usually temperate Pacific Northwest 
should get ready to sweat. Places like Seattle could reach 90 or higher 
next week, Masters said.

January chill: The winter Polar Vortex brought freezing temperatures and mountains of snow to much of the Midwest and Northeast

Chicago would normally see highs in the 
80s and lows in the mid-60s, but the weather service says highs early 
next week will climb no higher than the mid-60s — maybe 70 degrees— and 
lows could dip into the upper 40s.

The cool spell is coming at 
the wrong time for some athletes who are preparing for a triathlon in 
Wisconsin next weekend. If Lake Michigan is too cold, the swimming 
portion won't happen.

'It's disappointing because you've done all
 the preparations for it,' said Elizabeth Waterstraat, who has been 
coaching several people from suburban Chicago.

That sound you 
hear coming up from Oklahoma might be thousands or people turning off 
their money-gobbling air conditioners. It could also be the cheers of 
those who make their living working outside, like the employees at a 
Tulsa nursery, whose job entails hauling trees and shrubs around town.

Not quite: It's going to be cold in the midwest next week, but not 'polar vortex' cold

'We
 love it,' Paul James, marketing manager for Southwood Landscape & 
Garden Center, said of the forecast for temperatures running about 15 
degrees lower than the typical 93- or 94-degree July days. 'Any day you 
don't get above 100 degrees.'

Further north, the forecast is more
 bad news at the Maple Lane Resort in the western Michigan community of 
Empire, along Glen Lake, near Lake Michigan. This summer's cooler 
temperatures already have affected business.

'We are fully booked
 for weekends here this summer but we are seeing less families spend a 
week up here,' office manager Amanda Rennie said. 'Last year, the stays 
were longer (and) I think this may have something to do with the 
weather.'
