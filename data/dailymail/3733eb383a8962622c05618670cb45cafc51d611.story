The daughters of a teacher who was stabbed to death as she taught a classroom of pupils today joined thousands of mourners at a memorial service to celebrate her life.

Mother-of-two Ann Maguire, 61, died from multiple stab wounds following the attack at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April.

Her daughters Kerry, 32, and Emma, 31, today paid tribute to their ‘wonderful mother’ as they joined nearly 2,000 mourners at the special ceremony at Leeds Town Hall.

Around 1,200 people packed into the hall, while another 500 gathered in front of big screens outside.

Following the service, daughter Kerry - a trainee osteopath - said: ‘At today's memorial service we witnessed the celebration of Ann Maguire’s 40 years of service to the education in Leeds.

One of my mum’s life principles as a teacher was you could never put a limit on a child's potential.

‘We, the family, would like to thank all those who’ve lent their support over the past few months, those who’ve been involved in the preparation of today’s service, and all in attendance today.’

Her other daughter, Emma, who trained at the Royal Ballet School and has been a soloist of the Royal Ballet since 2011, told the BBC: 'I think what we took away was that we have so many of our own stories and memories of Mummy and we are so grateful people chose to share theirs.'

During the service, children’s choirs from the diocese of Leeds, including the Corpus Christi choir, led the hymns and a group of pupils and teachers from the school performed a rendition of The Beatles’ song My Life.

In a filmed compilation of tributes, pupils who were asked to use one word to describe Mrs Maguire said she was 'perfect', 'passionate', 'fantastic', 'amazing' and 'warm'.

The mother of two had taught at the school for more than 40 years prior to the attack and was due to retire this month.

A minute's silence was held for the Spanish teacher during the service and across the rest of Leeds today.

Her nephews Daniel and Andrew Poole, who were raised by Mrs Maguire after their mother's death, paid tribute to her in the service.

They said: 'You were a natural, wonderful mother - and you nurtured and loved us through every stage of our lives.

'And I know for every memory that we have shared here today, there will be thousands more for children all over Leeds from many, many different walks of life.

'All who are better for knowing you, and all who are grateful for the shelter and comfort we found in your loving embrace.

'So Ann, we're here today to say we miss you, we're here to say we love you - but we really, really would like to say thank you. Goodnight. God bless.'

Her friend and colleague Sheila O'Kane said: 'Ann never believed she was any in way special or different from thousands of other teachers.

'But to colleagues, and to generations of Corpus Christi pupils, she will remain very special indeed.'

And Leeds City Council deputy leader, councillor Judith Blake, said: 'Her legacy will live on in hearts and minds across the whole of the city.'

Rev Monsignor John Wilson of the 
Catholic Diocese of Leeds added: 'Whether she was chasing homework, 
singing in Spanish or soothing teenage anxieties, Ann rightly lived up 
to her accolade as the "mother of the school".'

Colleague Pete Fusco said: 'Ann Maguire, in pastoral care, set the 
standard for others to follow.

'She was one of the very best and will be 
so greatly missed.'

Yesterday, her husband Don, 
62, paid tribute to his 'beautiful, loving wife' and said he hoped the 
service would reflect her character.

He
 said: 'Ann was a very loving dedicated wife and a natural mother and it
 was her natural mothering qualities that I think made Ann such a 
wonderful teacher.

'She was a
 beautiful, dedicated, hard-working individual, so I hope that and the 
fact she had a very strong faith is reflected in this service.'

The
 many tributes which followed her death - the first killing of a teacher
 in a British school since the Dunblane massacre in 1996 - brought 
comfort and solace to the family, he said.

Mrs Maguire's death on April 
28 sent shockwaves through Britain and provoked an outpouring of 
sympathetic tributes from around the world.

Flowers and messages pinned 
on the fences outside the school gates stretched for more than 300ft 
(90m).

Many of the messages 
were from current and former pupils but others were from strangers who 
wanted to register their sadness.

Around 300 people attended her funeral
 Mass in May.

The
 Ann Maguire Arts Education Fund has been set up in her memory to 
provide bursaries and funding for the enhancement and personal 
development of young people through music, drama, language and dance.

In July a court heard a 16-year-old boy had accepted responsibility for the 'unlawful killing' of the teacher.

The
 teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared via video 
link at Leeds Crown Court, which heard a trial on a murder charge was 
due to begin in November.
