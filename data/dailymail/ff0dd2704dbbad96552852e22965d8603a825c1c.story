Tottenham are trying to broker a swap deal involving Jay Rodriguez and Andros Townsend. 

Manager Mauricio Pochettino is a keen admirer of Rodriguez from his time in charge at Southampton. 

Spurs feel they need another frontman and are in discussions with Manchester United over the possibility of taking Danny Welbeck, but have asked Saints about an exchange.

On his way? Tottenham are trying to broker a swap deal with Jay Rodriguez and Andros Townsend

Both Townsend and Rodriguez are valued between £12-14million. 

The Saints man broke his leg last season - scuppering any chance he had of going to the World Cup - and isn't expected to play until October.  

Out of favour? Townsend would move down to the south coast to play for Ronald Koeman's Southampton
