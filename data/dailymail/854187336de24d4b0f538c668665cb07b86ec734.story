Support: Art by Tracey Emin will be sold to help raise funds to send 'liquid food' to Africa

For thousands of Britons, packs of nutritionally balanced ‘liquid food’ will be familiar as a weight loss tool.

Most famously used in the LighterLife plan, they have helped more than 100,000 men and women tackle obesity.

Dieters who follow the plan eat only the oil-based pastes, specially formulated to contain all that is needed to sustain and nourish the human body.

Now, a charity auction of drawings by some of the most glittering names in art – including Tracey Emin, Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor – is helping raise funds so that these high-tech Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RTUF) can stop children dying of starvation in Africa.

The liquid food – which contains protein, fats, carbohydrates and a complete spectrum of 26 essential vitamins and minerals – was originally developed to tackle undernourishment.

And money raised from this week’s auction at Christie’s will go towards using the packs in the way they were first intended.

They are made by Valid Nutrition, a firm that sources ingredients where possible from indigenous producers and the local community.

VN was established in 2007 by a single man with a passion: Dr Steve Collins MBE.

He says: ‘The formula we used is based on a paste developed in France called Formula 100 – a blend of peanut paste, milk powder, oil and sugar – for palatability, and a mineral and vitamin mix that helps build muscle and active tissue, not just fat.’

VN has produced nearly  20 million lifesaving sachets, and more than 2.5 million children have already been treated with RTUF packs.

Lord Cholmondeley, David Rocksavage, is a key supporter of VN and played a major role in selecting the works of art up for auction this Wednesday.

Helping shake: The charity plans to sent 'liquid food' to starving children, a nutrition solution originally invented to aid undernourishment but which is most commonly used by those looking to shift the pounds

He says: ‘Dr Collins and his colleagues have developed the most effective way of treating children with severe acute malnutrition, and are continuing to drive change in how malnutrition is addressed, both in sub-Saharan Africa and in India.

'I believe there is no better way to tackle and eventually eliminate the curse of malnutrition than by supporting Valid’s work in the field.’

Dr Collins adds: ‘We’re hoping to raise in excess of £300,000 at the auction, and our main drive is funding our factory in Malawi.’
