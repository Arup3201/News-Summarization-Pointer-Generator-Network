When Saido Berahino won his first England call-up in November, he had just enjoyed a run of six goals in five games for West Brom and was on the back page of every national newspaper for the right reasons.

Just two months on and the sulky striker refused to celebrate any of his four goals during Saturday’s 7-0 victory over Gateshead in the third round of the FA Cup.

So what has upset the Baggies frontman?

Well, he didn’t make it off the bench with England for starters. We all expected to see Berahino win his first Three Lions cap in either the Euro qualifier with Slovenia or the friendly in Scotland. Roy Hodgson, though, chose not to introduce the 21-year-old and it remains to be seen whether he will be included in the next full squad.

Why is that?

It later emerged that he had been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving in October, two days after scoring for West Brom in a 2-2 draw with Manchester United. It was alleged he was driving at speeds of up to 110mph. If charged and found guilty, Berahino could face a penalty of up to six months in prison, a £5,000 fine and a driving ban of at least one year.

How has he performed since?

He did not score for West Brom until the New Year’s Day draw at West Ham and went 11 matches without a goal. In that time his form dipped and, with the team struggling, manager Alan Irvine was sacked.

What about his contract?

Berahino – who earns £12,000 a week - was in line for an improved deal in light of his scoring start to the campaign and promotion to the England senior ranks. Those talks, however, have been put on hold.

The striker was in blistering form at the start of the season, scoring six goals in five games for West Brom

Do West Brom risk losing him?

There has been talk of Liverpool making a £25m approach for the Burundi-born frontman and it is thought new boss Tony Pulis could well be willing to cash in as he looks to bring in his own players in their fight against relegation.

So what was his problem at the weekend?

Berahino scored four for the first time in his career but was in no mood to celebrate. He later insisted he was simply ‘acting professionally’ and said there was no need to explain himself to reporters.

What now?

All is clearly not well and the suggestion that West Brom could listen to offers for Berahino may well trigger a January approach from Liverpool, especially given his contract situation. He has 13 goals this season and would not be short of suitors should it become clear that he is available for transfer.

Berahino could well be on his way out of The Hawthorns if Liverpool make an offer
