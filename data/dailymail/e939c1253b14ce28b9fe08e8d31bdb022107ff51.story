Jack Colback was promised Newcastle were going places by manager Alan Pardew before he swapped the Stadium of Light for St James' Park, and the midfielder says he made the right call.

The 24-year-old left one North East club for the other in June, becoming the first player to cross the Wear-Tyne divide in 17 years.

And Colback, one of six signings made by Pardew this summer, has spoken of how impressed he has been, saying he's glad he can 'be a part of a team really looking to go places'.

'It's important in every player's career to play at as high a level as they can, and at Newcastle I've got a chance to be part of a team really looking to go places,' Colback told to The Sun.

'If you ask the manager, he'll tell you he is looking to really go for it this season and trying to push Newcastle to where we should be, high up the table.

'Before I joined he was telling me about the type of players he wanted and he has practised what he preached.

'He has brought in some quality players to add to the quality that was already in the squad. De Jong in particular has looked really high quality in training. His finishing has been brilliant and he looks a class act.

'I'm sure the Newcastle fans can't wait to see him and the rest of the new signings.'

Along with Colback, Pardew has signed Remy Cabella, Daryl Janmaat, Siem de Jong, Ayoze Perez and Emmanuel Riviere.

It means Newcastle, currently on a pre-season tour of New Zealand, have some gelling to do.

'With trips like this, you are with the lads 24/7, so you get that bond and that helps build a spirit between you,' Colback added.

'All the lads and the staff have been great ever since I arrived so it has been a pleasantly easy transition.'

Newcastle's Premier League season begins at home against champions Manchester City.
