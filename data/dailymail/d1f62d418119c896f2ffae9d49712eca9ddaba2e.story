A couple celebrated a wedding day moment to remember - after getting married on 11/12/13 - at 14:15.

Philip Broughton and Fiona Wiltshire picked the date and time to set up a unique numerical progression on their special day.

And the occasion went without a hitch, despite some initial reservations from the registrar.

Groom Philip, 60, said: 'When we tried to book for quarter past we were told we had to choose 2pm or 2.30pm. So we went for 2.30pm and planned to turn up early.

'It wasn't until five weeks ago when we were speaking to our registrar and she asked us about the time that we got it sorted. Once we explained she said it wouldn't be a problem.

'We'd like to thank the registrar for being so understanding and letting us do it.'

Bride Fiona, 47, said: 'It's one you won't forget. We wanted to get married in December and it was Phil's idea to do it today. Some guests did raise an eyebrow when we said but most of them only noticed when we pointed it out.'

Ian Hulme, the best man, was behind the idea of the quarter past two ceremony. He said: 'As soon as they told me the date I said you should have it at that time. It's just obvious isn't it?'

The ceremony and reception, for 65 people, was held at Best Western Hotel Smokies on Ashton Road in Oldham.

Thankful: The couple, from Norton Moss, were delighted that the registrar agreed to hold their wedding at the slightly unusual time of 2.15pm

When asked about pre-wedding jitters, the groom said: 'I wasn't at all nervous until this morning but I do have a jippy tummy now. It's alright for Fiona, because she has to get ready and get her hair done, so she's occupied, I've just got to wait around. And I've gone and forgot my book!

'Last night I stayed in the room Fiona and the bridesmaids will be getting ready in and was threatened with serious injury not to look at the dresses.'

Fiona added: 'I'm relieved now we've had the service. I wasn't really nervous before but I'm just relieved everything has gone without a hitch.'

Philip, originally from Ardwick, and Fiona, from Newton Moss, first met five years ago through their passion for ballroom dancing and got engaged on Christmas Day last year. Philip said: 'We just got on really well straight away.'

The couple have decided to put off their honeymoon until next year.Â 

Philip said: 'Home. That's the only place we'll be going - finish work next week and get ready for Christmas.'
