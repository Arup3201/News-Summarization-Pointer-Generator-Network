Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

The Red Devils have won 10 and lost none of their 12 previous Premier League meetings with QPR.

Queens Park Rangers have not kept a clean sheet against Man Utd since September 1992, when they drew 0-0 at Old Trafford in the first ever Premier League meeting.

Since that stalemate, Manchester United have won five consecutive home league games against the Londoners.

The R’s have only won one of 21 previous away league games against Man Utd (D3 L17); winning 4-1 in January 1992.

QPR haven't claimed a league point at Manchester United since their first ever Premier League meeting in September 1992 at Old Trafford

Two points from three games is Manchester United’s worst start since 2007-08 (also two points from three games). That season, they won the league and Champions League.

Richard Dunne could make his 400th Premier League start in this game; he would become only the 22nd player to reach the milestone.

Since 2009-10, Falcao has scored 104 goals in 139 league apps (for Porto, A.Madrid & Monaco combined).

Harry Redknapp’s side have had just two shots fewer than Chelsea this season, but have scored 10 fewer goals (one goal from 33 shots).

The Red Devils have entered September with only two competitions to compete for the first time since 1962/63, when they only entered the league and the FA Cup.

Only three Premier League players (Sturridge, Bony, Sterling) have had more shots at goal than Steven Caulker this season (seven, six headed).
