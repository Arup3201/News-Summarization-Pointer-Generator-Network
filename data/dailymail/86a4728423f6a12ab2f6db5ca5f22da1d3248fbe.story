A couple have been forced out of their home after its damp and mouse infestation allegedly made their children sick.

Rachel Murdoch, 23, and Jason Taylor, 35, have repeatedly complained about the vermin, slugs and severe damp in their home, where they raise their two children Marcus, two, and seven-month-old Lilly.

But they say their landlord and housing association have failed to fix the problem, despite endless requests, which has put their family under strain.

The pair moved into the house in Sheffield a year ago, and soon experienced problems with unwanted guests.

But despite several complaints to their housing provider, they say little action has been taken.

Now Mr Taylor says the catalogue of problems, the stress of which has caused him and his partner to break up, are even making his children ill and aggravating their asthma.

Mr Taylor, a removal man, said: 'We are at breaking point over this. Me and my partner broke up over this it's caused that much stress.'

They now plan to move out this weekend - Miss Murdoch and the children with her parents and Mr Taylor to a hostel. 

Miss Murdoch added: 'We'd spent four happy years together before this, but when you're watching your children getting ill, you're sending them to school smelling of damp every day and you're living with constant mice and droppings in the house and dead rats outside - even the strongest relationships would break down.'

'This horrible house, and the fact that nobody seems to care about us, has nearly caused our family to break down,' she added.

'The landlord takes his money every month, and doesn't seem to bother about the conditions we are living in. Nobody should have to clean up mice corpses and droppings all the time.'

Miss Murdoch said her children, who both suffer from asthma, have experienced breathing problems in the house.

She said: 'The children play about like mad outside - but in this damp house, they're out of breath in a few minutes and need a puff on the inhaler. I am surprised that the state of the house hasn't caused a serious attack in one of them yet.'

Miss Murdoch also believes the droppings may have caused stomach upsets in her children.

She said: 'No matter how hard you try and clean up all the droppings, it's a never-ending task and there'll always be more the next day.

'Both the children have been getting ill, not just with the breathing difficulties, but with stomach upsets a lot more than you would expect and we believe it is because of this house.'

She added: 'But you see mice everywhere - all the time.

'One even ran right past Marcus when he was sat playing on the kitchen floor and scared the life out of him. No child should have to live in these conditions for a year.'

Mr Taylor said that their housing provider had promised to fix the catalogue of problems, but the work never materialised.

'They came down and they promised all this stuff they were going to do and then they did nothing. 

'Social services kept giving them deadlines to get this stuff done but they never did. They kept doing small stuff as to look like they are doing something.

He added: 'They have left us in that house for a year now. The kids have to sleep with us because in Marcus' room there are mice.'

But now the family have decided that enough is enough.

Miss Murdoch said: 'We're moving out this weekend. Me and the children are moving in with my mum and Jason is going to move to a hostel for the time being - we just can't take any more of this.'

Mould: Walls in one of the bedroom (pictured) and elsewhere in the home, as well as damp, are said to be aggravating the children's asthma

The house, which also homes mouse corpses and an infestation of droppings, is owned by a private landlord and rented by housing company Metropolitan.

A spokesman for Sheffield Council said: 'The council's private housing standards team has been working with partner agencies to ensure required works are carried out by the landlord to address the issues present here - this is a complex case with a number of relevant factors.

'A number of repairs have been completed already, and we have agreed with Metropolitan and the landlord that further works will be finalised by the end of August.'

'The council will continue to monitor progress and take any further action deemed necessary.'

A spokesman for the housing association said: 'Metropolitan does not own the property, but provides support to the family living there.

'When the family moved in we ensured that it met all relevant health and safety standards and Sheffield Council's private housing standards team has assessed the property following the concerns raised.

'The owner of the property has dealt with all of the key issues, including replacement of the boiler, and all relevant safety certification is in place. Our team continues to provide the family with support alongside a number of other agencies.'
