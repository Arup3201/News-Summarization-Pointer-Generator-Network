Ban: An advert for Maximus penis enlargement capsules, featured in four-page direct mailing Life Healthcare, has been banned by the ASA after it offended a complainant

An advert for penis enhancement capsules that suggested a man was 'inadequate' has been banned.

The man contacted advertising watchdogs after reading ads telling him his penis size was a 'disappointment' and that his partner might be 'turned off'.

The ad for Maximus penis enlargement capsules boasted that men could 'have a penis that's inches longer and much thicker naturally, without surgery, pumps or exercise'.

The direct mailing, headed 'Dear XXXX',  asked if 'the size of your penis a disappointment to you and your partner' and whether the 'inability to satisfy your partner leaves you demoralised and depressed'.

It goes on to say 'Your lack of confidence and low self esteem is making you unattractive to others', adding 'any partner you have is simply turned off by your small size'.

One man, whose name is unknown, took such offence at the ads that he contacted the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).

He had viewed the adverts in Life Healthcare, a four-page mailing that he received on a monthly basis.

The ASA noted the man had not requested the mailing and might be put out by ads suggesting his penis size might be a 'disappointment'.

The watchdog felt the repeated references to how the size of his manhood and sexual performance could be improved, along with the personal nature of the suggestions, were likely to cause seriously offence and breached the ASA code of practice.

The ASA also said the complainant had received the ads on a regular basis, despite contacting the advertisers on a regular basis asking them to stop.

The ASA banned the ad, ruling that Life Healthcare had made persistent and unwanted marketing communications, and said the company must suppress the complainant's personal data.

Complaint: The man contacted advertising watchdogs after being bombarded with ads telling him his penis size was a 'disappointment' and that his partner might be 'turned off'

Ruling: The ASA noted the man had not requested the mailing and might be put out by ads suggesting his penis size might be a 'disappointment'

Visible: The ASA said that the circular had been posted through letterboxes and could therefore be seen by children

A leaflet for a 'Cougar dating' website showing a woman with her knickers pulled down to her knees has been banned.

The 'irresponsible circular, advertising by Comeletsplay.com, was found to be in breach of advertising rules regarding social responsibility.

Watchdogs launched a probe following a complaint about the leaflet, describing it as 'untargeted' and featuring images which were unsuitable for children.

The circular featured four images including one showing a woman lying on her front wearing a bra and thong knickers, alongside the words 'Cougar Dating'.

Another image showed a woman's legs with knickers pulled down to around her knees alongside the words 'No Strings Dating'.

A third image showed two men embracing and two women leaning in to kiss each other alongside the words 'Gay Dating'.

The dating site said it hadn't received any complaints despite more than 45,000 copies of the circular having been distributed. 

It said no-one it has asked for comments about the leaflet thought their children could or would be affected by the circular, and that 'more graphic' images could be seen in lingerie catalogues which were sometimes posted through letterboxes.

However, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the single complaint and ordered that it must not appear again in its current form.

An ASA spokesman said: 'We understood the circular had been posted through letterboxes and could therefore be seen by children.
