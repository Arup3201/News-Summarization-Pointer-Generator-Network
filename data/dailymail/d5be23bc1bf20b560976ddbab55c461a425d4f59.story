An Australian expat living in France has posted a step-by-step guide for making Vegemite pizza, a recipe introduced by Pizza Hut for Australia Day.

The step-by-step photographic guide was posted on Imgur on Friday by user littlemissbossy.

Throughout the post, the woman takes some subtle stabs at the British spread, which she labels 'Vegelite'.

In one caption she writes: ‘Marmite was a lot easier to spread, but ease does not = superiority.’ 

'Obviously, the Vegemite half was the better but I'll admit, the Marmite half wasn't too bad,' she writes in another.

The description for the post reads:‘I'm Australian and live in France, so couldn't try the Vegemite stuffed crust pizza. Not to worry, I made my own!'

My other half is English, so to stop him being a whining Pom I conceded that his half could have Marmite (aka Vegelite).’

Pizza Hut’s Vegemite stuffed crust pizza has made a nationwide splash this week in time for Australia Day, with some embracing the true-blue meal and others turning up their nose in disgust.

A promotional video for the pizza was released this week which features foreigners in a Sydney hostel tasting the Mitey Stuffed Crust.

Not surprisingly, travellers from Spain, The Netherlands, France and Chile were appalled by the acquired taste, endeavouring to figure out exactly what they had just eaten.

'Medicine? Petrol? Fish jam?' the men of the group ask as they appear to be fighting the urge to vomit.

Two men from Chile are persistent that the Vegemite is fish jam, claiming that the substance is 'horrible'.

The video has had more than 110,000 views since it was uploaded on Monday. 

In a promo for the new pizza, Pizza Hut took to Noah's Backpackers at Bondi Beach to carry out a taste test on non-Australians
