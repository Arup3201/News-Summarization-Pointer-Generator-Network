Politicians were yesterday  accused of squandering 350 years of British transport supremacy after Dubai overtook Heathrow as the world’s busiest airport.

Dubai International Airport has carried more international passengers than Heathrow for three months in a row, according to the latest figures.

The quarterly results from the airports reveal that Dubai is also well on course to overtake Heathrow’s passenger numbers  for the whole of this year – which would put an end to a 350-year period in which Britain has been home to either the world’s busiest port or airport.

The changing of the guard was seized upon by the bosses of Heathrow and British Airways, both of whom have been campaigning for a third runway at Europe’s busiest airport.

Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways’ parent company IAG, blamed dithering politicians for allowing Heathrow to be knocked into second place.

‘We have squandered our No 1 world ranking through a total lack of political vision for Britain,’ he said. ‘This country has no aviation policy.’

Mr Walsh predicted in 2012 that Heathrow would be overtaken by Dubai, blaming political indecision.

Yesterday, the Irish boss, who has said he does not believe British politicians will ever agree on a third runway at Heathrow, warned that the delay was hurting the economy.

‘This isn’t just about aviation, this is about connecting the UK to the world. It will cost British jobs, growth and reputation.’

Heathrow’s drop into second place was revealed on the same day that the airport’s boss, Colin Matthews, announced his decision to retire.

And Mr Matthews issued a parting shot at politicians for hampering Heathrow’s future, while competitors such as Frankfurt, Dubai and Paris have grown rapidly. ‘Heathrow can’t keep up with them,’ he said. ‘It is full, with no spare capacity. Unless we expand, Heathrow’s decline will make the whole of the UK a less attractive place to do business.’

A commission led by economist Sir Howard Davies has been considering options for expanding the UK’s airports since 2012, but is not due to come up with a final recommendation until 2015.

London Mayor Boris Johnson favours a new £65billion hub in the Thames Estuary, while Gatwick has made its case to be allowed a second runway.

Dubai has grown rapidly thanks to its position in the Middle East and the strength of the luxurious Emirates airline, which is based there. Statistics from both airports showed that Dubai hosted 18million international passengers between December 2013 and February 2014, compared to 14.9million at Heathrow.

Mr Matthews’ retirement is understood to be unconnected to Heathrow losing top spot. The airport boss said he had ‘decided the time is right to pass on the baton’ after six years in the job.

Mr Matthews pointed to his record in revamping Terminal 2, which is due to open in June, as well as improvements in customer satisfaction surveys after the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008.

But he has also presided over crises such as the chaos caused by snow in 2010, when flights were grounded for days.
