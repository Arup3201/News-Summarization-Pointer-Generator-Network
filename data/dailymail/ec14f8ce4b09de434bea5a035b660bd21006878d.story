If you could go back and repeat your teenage girl years again, would you?

Your answer depends on whether you can see past the svelte waist, that dynamite metabolism, the lack of council tax and the fact rent was paid by your parents and remember all the wobbly moments... largely brought on by hectic haywire hormones.

Each year, the average hormonal British teenage girl has 183 rows with their mother, slams 164 doors, sheds 123 bouts of tears over boys each year, engages in 257 battles with siblings and falls out with friends 127 times, according to a study.

The plight of a teenage girl: Young women have, on average, 183 rows with their mothers and shed 123 lots of tears over boys every year

The chatterboxes also spend 274 hours on the phone to friends.

A quarter of women questioned by Li-Lets admit their 'testing teens' had been full of anxiety and regrettably hard on the whole family.

Rows over bedroom tidiness, answering back and dating boys were among the most common causes of arguments between mum and daughter.

And it is only when a woman reaches the age of 23 that she finally starts to appreciate everything their mother did for her.

But despite not always seeing eye-to-eye with mum, four in ten (40 per cent) still say they had heart-to-hearts, which proved 'crucial' in getting through the demonic decade.

Lots of squabbles: Rows over bedroom tidiness, answering back and dating boys were among the most common causes of arguments between mother and daughter

Three quarters of women (75 per cent) are grateful to their mum for the way they were raised, even if they failed to realise it at the time.

164 door slams

183 grumbles with mum

257 arguments with siblings

153 fall-outs with dad

127 fall-outs with mates

123 tears over boys

125 chats with friends about periods

306 chats with friends about boys

274 hours on the phone

And 67 per cent say their mum made them the person they are today - even saying they owe her a 'debt of gratitude' for guiding them tough times.

When it comes to the perfect mother-daughter relationship, a 25-year age gap was deemed ideal, the study of 2,000 women found.

Only one in five (22 per cent) feel mums and their daughters should be best friends who tell each other everything.

Instead, three quarters (76 per cent) feel the relationship is best if there is a close bond but some things remain private.

For many girls, periods, sex and contraception are the subjects that fall firmly into the 'private' category.

Indeed, a third of women (33 per cent) said they would struggle to talk to their mum about their 'time of the month'. And nearly two thirds shuddered at the idea of talking about sex, the pill, and condoms.

Oh, grow up, darling: It is only when a woman reaches the age of 23 that she finally starts to appreciate everything their mother did for her

Mothers and daughters in East Anglia have the strongest bond, with 39 per cent describing themselves as 'close'.

1. Tidiness of bedroom

2. Answering back

3. Relationship with siblings

4. Relationships with boys

5. Staying out too late

6. The way I dressed

7. Attitude to school work

8. Money

9. Manners

10. Use of bad language

In contrast, 52 per cent in Northern Ireland admit spending their teenage years fighting against each other.

Hannah
Jones, from Southampton, Hants, said she was a 'typical teenager' who 
was always arguing with friends, making-up, and falling-out again.

The 36-year-old office worker added: 'I had regular rows with my mum when growing up, and slammed endless doors in the process.

'At the time, I felt mum was trying to stop me from having fun, but I now realise she always had my best interests at heart.

'As I have got older, we have grown closer, and talk more about personal things than I ever did before.

'My
teenage years were stressful for the whole family and my relationships 
with friends were rocky but my life turned out OK in the end.'

Fight club: Teenage girls fall out with friends, on average, 127 times a year, and with siblings 257 times

Mary Young, from Lil-Lets, said: 'The relationship between mum and daughter can be testing during the teenage years but it's clear that when a woman reaches her early twenties she appreciates her mum more than ever.

'It's not unusual for a girl's teenage years to be full of angst.

'Falling out with parents, worries about growing up and long chats over boys is probably the norm for most teenage girls.

'But as you get older you really learn to appreciate your mum and how much she did for you.

'At Lil-lets we understand that being a teenager is hard, but having a mum to turn to and talk things through or answer any questions is priceless in helping young women to manage.'
