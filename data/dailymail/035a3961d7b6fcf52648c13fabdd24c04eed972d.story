Tragic: Aaron Burgess, 14, drowned at the weir on the River Avon between Bath and Bristol in July last year

A 14-year-old boy drowned in a river after being 'egged on' to slide down a weir by a group of older boys, an inquest heard.

Aaron Burgess, from Saltford, had been swimming in the River Avon between Bath and Bristol with two friends when the tragedy took place.

The trio came across some older boys who encouraged them to slide down the steep wall into the river.

But Aaron, who was not a strong swimmer, failed to resurface after sliding in.

Detective Sergeant Marc Hathway, who 
collated witness statements, told Flax Bourton Coroner's Court: 'I don't know if it was 
the first time Aaron went down the sluice but he was egged on, and may 
have been encouraged, by other people who told him to have a go.

'I don't
think they saw it as a risk. Aaron said he would go first and he was very quickly followed by his two friends, Jesse and Joe.

'He immediately got into difficulties, he surfaced but then seemed to go under on at least two other occasions.

'He spat out mouthfuls of water and shouted for help from his friends, he seemed to be trying to keep his head above the water.

'His friends told him to roll onto his back to keep afloat and Jesse swam over and told him to grab his arm.

'But Aaron was panicking by this stage and grabbed Jesse around the neck and was pulling him under.

'Jesse felt he was going to drown so he had to make the awful decision to leave Aaron and swim to the side for help.'

Dangerous: The inquest heard how the weir did not have any life-saving measures and that Aaron's friends were unable to save him

Despite best friend Connor and passer-by
Joe Stevens attempting to rescue the schoolboy with a dinghy, Aaron 
slipped under the water for a final time and never resurfaced.

The inquest heard how temperatures peaked at 25 degrees C on the day of the tragedy on July 24 last year.

Giving evidence, Mr Stevens said: 'We were 
about five or 10 metres away from him and he then went under the water 
for the last time and the didn't come back up.

'We stayed and waited for four to five minutes hoping he might pop up and we could rescue him, but he didn't.'

Aaron's body was recovered six 
hours later by police divers who found him resting on boulders on the 
river bed only a few metres from where he went under.

Aaron's father Jamie Burgess condemned health and safety standards at the weir and said more needed to be done to prevent against future accidents.

Heartbreak: Mountains of floral tributes were left near the lock where Aaron drowned

The inquest heard the Canals and River Trust (CRT) legally hold health and safety responsibility for the lock and part of the weir, and had not put any life saving equipment at the site because they deemed it 'not necessary'.

Tony Stammers, the Health and Safety Officer for the trust, said: 'Signs and life rings were deemed not necessary because principally the safety of those using the river for navigation is our concern, and it was not needed.

'Our responsibility is not for the health and safety of the general public outside the lock area, this is privately owned land and their responsibility.'

Coroner Maria Voisin recorded a verdict of accidental death and said there was nothing his friends could have done to save the youngster.

Egged on: The inquest heard that Aaron and his friends had been sliding down the weir into the weir after being encouraged by older boys

She added that she would use Rule 43, which allows coroners to suggest actions that should be taken to prevent further deaths, to order a report by the Canals and River Trust into further health and safety measures.

Speaking after the inquest Mr Burgess, 39, said he was devastated by his son's death and had warned him from walking over the weir and swimming in the river.

He said: 'Obviously I am still devastated because I have lost my son.

'I
had warned Aaron, he was not a strong swimmer. We had done a lot of 
fishing and I told him not to go in there but kids will be kids and they
do those things, you can't stop them and you can't keep an eye on them 
24/7.'

The father-of-three 
also condemned the health and safety of the weir, claiming the Canal and
River Trust had not done enough to keep the area safe.

'I
feel health and safety issues need to be addressed. I think they could 
put a piece of fence to deter anyone from walking on the weir', he said.

'I don't think the CRT has done enough, in my eyes I think they have tried to shove the blame on to somebody else.

'I think they could have done a little bit more, especially given the saving of somebody else only six weeks earlier.'

Since Aaron's death three life rings have now been placed at the scene, two provided by family and friends, and one by the CRT, alongside a sign warning people not to swim in the river.
