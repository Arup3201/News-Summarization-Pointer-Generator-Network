An artist who crafted a sculpture of a horse's head in central London was so distressed at the local pigeons making a mess of his landmark he has climbed the 35ft high structure to clean it himself.

Nic Fiddian-Green is known the world over for his incredible signature sculptures of horses inspired by his own chestnut hunter George.

His bronze horse creation Still Water is now a permanent feature in Marble Arch but it appears the pigeons loved it as much as London sightseers - leaving the prominent statue in need of a spring clean.

Tall order: Artist Nic Fiddian-Green is lifted up in a crane to clean his bronze horse sculpture Still Water at Marble Arch in London early on Sunday morning

But after spending hundreds of hours making the Still Water sculpture, Mr Fiddian-Green was determined to take on the tricky job himself early Sunday morning.

The artist was lifted up and suspended over the bronze horse in a cherry picker before proceeding to wash it down with a sponge.

He said: 'It is a great honour that Westminster city council have made this a permanent work of art for the city.

'I am humbled that so many people have written to me and that I am still able to uplift and inspire people as they pass by, rushing to work.'

Mr Fiddian-Green has created numerous works of horses - including the Horse at Water sculpture previously homed in Marble Arch but now moved to Australia.
