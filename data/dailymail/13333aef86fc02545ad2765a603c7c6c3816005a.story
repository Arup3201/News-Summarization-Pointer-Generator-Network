Out on top: Consumers praised John Lewis for its service and the quality of its products

When times are tough, we all think that little bit longer about where to spend our hard-earned salaries.

But it seems that homegrown British businesses have managed to earn our trust – taking nine out of the ten top spots on this year’s list of the nation’s favourite brands.

Department store John Lewis, which is owned by its staff, was named the overall winner, climbing from second position into the coveted first-place slot.

Consumers praised the company for its service and the quality of its products, as well as its overall integrity as a brand.

John Lewis replaced controversial US web giant Amazon – which fell from first to fourth place after facing a backlash for only paying £2.4million corporation tax on sales of £4billion last year.

The study of customer perceptions, carried out by analysts Nunwood, also saw British success stories QVC, First Direct, Virgin Atlantic, Marks & Spencer, Lush and Ocado reach the top ten.

And one iconic British brand managed to make something of a breakthrough this year – with Butlins rising from 165th to 14th place in the table.

Historically, the company was known for its redcoats and a rather cheap and cheerful approach to hospitality.

However its owners have spent millions developing new upmarket hotels and apartments, to make it a competitor to the likes of Center Parcs.

Nunwood director David Conway explained that Amazon had been tarnished by its decision not to make a bigger contribution to public services in the UK this year.

He said: ‘People expressed the view that if a company is trying to avoid tax, then what does that say about their reputation more generally? Amazon is not alone now, there is a lot of competition.

‘If that perception of Amazon holds for any length of time then you would expect it to affect their bottom line.’

By contrast he said that shoppers were keen to reward firms with strong British roots.

He said: ‘The idea that in difficult times there is a flight to trust is something that is seen more widely in our study.

Buying British: Consumers seem to be valuing homegrown brands over their international competitors

‘There is a sense of people sticking with British in times of difficulty.

‘The brands that have done particularly well have focused on delivering a really good experience and have a strong British heritage.’

He added: ‘Unquestionably, there is a bit of an aura around John Lewis. The fact that it is owned by its employees has given it a halo effect.

‘Customers have a feeling that the staff try that bit harder and make an extra effort, so they view it as a brand that they can trust.’

Small UK companies to win plaudits included the online wine retailer Laithwaites, founded by Tony Laithwaite in 1969 and the cheap mobile phone tariff provider GiffGaff, founded by Cambridge graduate Gav Thompson.

Mr Conway said: ‘These are brands that are both British, but are also identifiable by their owners.

‘There is an almost romantic appeal of British entrepreneurs, who are driving British businesses and making a success of them.’
