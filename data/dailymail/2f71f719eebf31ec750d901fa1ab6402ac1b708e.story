Sir Philip Green knows how to tap the starriest of fashion week front rows and today's Topshop Unique show was no different.

Cara Delevingne, Kendall Jenner, Ellie Goulding, Emily Ratajkowski, Daisy Lowe and Alexa Chung all came out in force as the British high street Mecca unveiled its AW15 collection at the Tate Britain on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

But it wasn't just the glitzy front row getting tongues wagging; the brand's upcoming collection, which was inspired by the British countryside, proved to be as impressive as the stars watching it hit the runway.

Topshop Unique unveiled its AW15 collection at the Tate Britain on Sunday - and proved the country bumpkin has had a cool and edgy makeover

Unique knows how to do the kind of wearable and accessible fashion that makes Topshop's clothes fly off the shelves quicker than you can say Cara Delevingne - and today's offering was no exception.

The country bumpkin uniform (once embraced by a young Kate Middleton) has been treated to a cool and playful new edge. 

The collection aimed to add that touch of luxury to every day pieces, trimming coats with shearling and giving the standard mini skirt a high gloss finish

Dresses and shirts came emblazoned with dainty thistle prints inspired by the wild

Feminine floral silk dresses were slashed to the hip and teamed with streamlined hunting boots, while the country trench was souped up in vinyl. 

This season, garments were given a sophisticated edge by adding a touch of luxury to every day pieces.

Dresses and skirts were trimmed with luxurious shearling,  racer back mini dresses were heavily embellished with eye-catching crystals and tailored shirts were ornately embroidered with dainty thistle prints inspired by the wild.

The collection was designed with capsule wardrobes in mind and is all about layering come autumn 

The winter coat was given a sexy makeover and came in glossy vinyl 

Turtle necks still reign supreme and came in powder blue, vibrant yellows and off white teamed with blue corduroy mini skirts and blazers or check pinafore dresses.

The collection, which was designed with capsule wardrobes in mind, will make autumn the season of layering.

As for evening wear - perhaps in a nod to the show's entire front row - it's all about the spirited party girl.

Alexa Chung, Pixie Geldof, Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne and Sir Philip Green held up the frow
