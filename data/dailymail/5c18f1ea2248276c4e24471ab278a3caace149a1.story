Scantily-clad prostitutes touting for trade in Amsterdam are among the unusual scenes to feature in a new art exhibition.

They were captured going about their daily business by one of Google's international army of Street View cars.

Artist Jon Rafman, from Montreal, Canada, spent hours at a time on the website searching for oddball scenes.

He also found images of youths giving
the finger to a Street View car; a van ablaze in Rio De Janeiro; a 
flock of seagulls on a residential street in Portugal; and a tank on a 
country road in the Netherlands.

Mr Rafman said: 'Often I search seven hours before I find anything.'

An exhibition of prints he has made 
from the Google Street View scenes is being staged at the Saatchi 
Gallery in West London and a book of his work has also been published.

Mr Rafman said: 'In 2008, a year 
after Google sent out an army of hybrid vehicles bearing nine cameras on
a single pole to photograph the world, I began an exploration of this 
new virtual world.

'I was fascinated by how powerfully 
Street View photographs can represent our contemporary experience, the 
conflict they can express between an indifferent robotic camera and 
man’s search for connectedness and significance.

'The photos underscore the tension between an uncaring camera and man’s need to interpret his experience.

'While celebrating and critiquing 
modern experience, the technological tools themselves show how they can 
estrange us from ourselves.'
