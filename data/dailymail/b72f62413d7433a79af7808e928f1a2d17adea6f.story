For most of us sticking to a diet plan, the likes of Bolognese and spaghetti carbonara are strictly off limits.

But thanks to a new kitchen gadget which transforms everyday fruit and vegetable into low-calorie ‘pasta’ dishes, this has all changed.

Sales of the spiralizer - a cutting device that creates nutritious, low-carb pasta and noodle-like ribbons from fruit and vegetables - have spiralled through the roof.

Amazon has seen a 1,400 per cent year on year jump in sales of the device, while shops such as Aldi are facing an increase in sales of courgettes and carrots due to the popularity of the product.

Kitchen magic: The spiralizer turns fruit and vegetables into noodles  in less time than it takes to peel a spud

Championed by trendy health-food chefs such as Deliciously Ella and the Helmsley sisters, the gadget enables health-lovers to integrate guilt-free hearty 'pasta' and 'noodle' dishes into their diet.

Ella Woodward — otherwise known as 23-year-old foodie Deliciously Ella — is an advocate of courgetti – ribbons of courgette boiled and used as a pasta substitute.

Miss Woodward – who can be seen eating courgetti on the cover of one of her cookbooks - recently wrote on her blog: ‘Courgette pasta itself is just incredible, so quick and easy to make.

‘It really does taste like spaghetti too, especially if you cook it for a few minutes which softens it.

‘I use this machine [spiralizer] to make my pasta and it is amazing, very small, light and inexpensive. 

'It also slices numerous other fruit and veg in countless ways. A really perfect tool for anyone looking for new healthy alternatives.’ 

In the latest move from carbohydrates and wheat, the spiralizer can make dishes from various boiled fruit and vegetables including potatoes, cucumbers, cabbage, onions, celery, radish, beetroot, apples and pears.

The product took America by storm last year and sales suggest the same is taking place in the UK.

An Amazon spokesperson said: ‘Spiralizers are a great way to get more vegetables in your diet.

‘Courgettes transformed into “courgette” seems to be very popular, but customer reviews tell us that the nation has also been experimenting with sweet potato ribbon crisps and even carrot ramen noodles.’ At Aldi, carrot sales are up 23 per cent year on year, while courgettes have risen 34 per cent.

The supermarket says the reason behind this is the new trend for health-conscious consumers to turn vegetable into ribbons.

An Aldi spokesperson said: ‘By buying veg for spiralizing at Aldi, shoppers are making the most of our everyday low prices, while buying the other ingredients they need to make fantastic, and healthy, meals at home.

‘Customers are able to experiment with a variety of quality fresh fruit and vegetables, available in store as part of Aldi’s extensive fresh produce offering.’ Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, otherwise known as female food duo Hemsley + Hemsley, have launched their own spiralizing machine.

The pair, who run a blog and a bespoke food delivery service, include various spiralize recipes in their cookbook The Art of Eating Well, including beef ragu courgetti and sesame chicken salad with cucumber noodles.

Spiralizers retail at between £14.99 and £46.99.
