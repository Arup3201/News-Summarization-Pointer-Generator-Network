Three teenagers have been arrested and charged with attempted first-degree premeditated murder. 

Dylan Thomas, 17, his fiancee Jessie Umberger, 18, and Rebecca Gotay, 18, all students at Satellite High School in Satellite Beach, Florida, were arrested Friday and are being held without bond after they attacked a former friend Thursday morning before school, beating the man with a crowbar in hopes of killing him.

The young man, Daniel Vukovich, 17, is in critical condition.

The sheriff's office told Florida Today that the teens had been planning their attack for several weeks in retaliation for the theft of marijuana by the victim.

They arrived at the young man's house shortly before school Thursday, and police claim Gotay was the getaway driver and Umberger waited with her in the car while Thomas beat the victim with the crowbar.

Vukovich was later found in his driveway by his mother, who called 911.

The teens met Wednesday night to plan this and prepare according to authorities, and none of the three arrested teens lived with their parents.

Gotay and Thomas are both children of local physicians. 

Three area schools were temporary placed on lockdown after the incident as police searched for the suspects.

Satellite Beach, the town where the three attended high school, is a popular and quiet beachfront area in the state of Florida.

Already on social media, people are defending Becca, saying she should not be held accountable for what happened.

'If you think becca gotay is a attempted murderer unfollow me right now and consider us not friends cause you're the truly ignorant one,' wrote one young woman on Twitter. 

'Not Becca :( keep your head up shawty you got this,' wrote another person on Twitter. 

'So all beccas close friends WHO KNOW HER WELL say she wouldn't do it but everyone who isnt close thinks she deserves to rot,' said another.
