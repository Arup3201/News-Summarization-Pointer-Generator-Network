These are the secrets harbored for more than 100 years by a miles-wide reservoir outside of Seattle, Washington.

Lake Tapps, which was flooded in 1911 to power a hydro-electric dam, swallowed up four and a half square miles of countryside, including an old railway line and parts of a forest.

The images, taken last week by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, also shows discarded items which have been lost in the lake, which is now used for recreation.

Emptied out: Local authorities started emptying the lake to enable repairs to be made to a nearby dam. In usual conditions the above homes jut out onto the water

Authorities in the Seattle area drained the lake this winter to relieve pressure on the nearby dam, which had developed a crack.

The lake was first formed when the Puget Sound Energy energy company filled the area with water to generate electricity.

It stopped producing power in 2009 and has been used for fishing, boating and other waterborne activities since.

The maintenance project has now been completed, according to Bonney Lake Courier-Herald, and the lake is being refilled.

The process is expected to be finished at the end of May. 

Abandoned: Bits of junk, and items like this CD, were also uncovered by the lake-emptying project

Underwater forest: These tree trunks have been sitting under the water for the 104 years since the area was flooded

New use: The lake hasn't been producing hydro-electric power since 2009, and is now just for recreation
