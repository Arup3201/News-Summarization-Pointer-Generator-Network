Jose Mourinho's work in the summer transfer market has been lauded as a masterstroke - with Chelsea making a profit while bringing in the likes of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas.

But the Chelsea boss says future summers will be more like this one - with the Blues no longer willing to splash out hundreds of millions on star players as they were in the early years of Roman Abramovich's reign.

Mourinho reckons Financial Fair Play will spell the end for Chelsea's days as big spenders - and says they will never match the £60million fee Manchester United have paid for Angel Di Maria, breaking Chelsea's transfer record of £50m for Fernando Torres in January 2011.

Changes: Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas came in at Chelsea but David Luiz and Romelu Lukaku left

'We are making money to be able to spend money. In every transfer window Chelsea is losing players, is selling players,' Mourinho told Eurosport.

Chelsea's commercial revenue is far behind that of Manchester United - who have spent big on the likes of Di Maria and Luke Shaw during the summer - with the Blues bringing in just £30m a season from a kit deal with Adidas compared to United's new £75m-a-year sponsorship.

But Mourinho has no problems with cutting his spending after previously working on a shoe-string budget at Porto. 

'Chelsea in this moment is not a spender – Chelsea in this moment is making more money in transfers than the money we spend.

'So Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern, Manchester (United) – all these huge teams, I think they have an advantage.'
