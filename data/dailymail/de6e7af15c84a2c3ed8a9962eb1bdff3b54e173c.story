An expert criticised confusion over who was clinically responsible for Mr Pattrick, pictured here on holiday in Canada

An under-fire hospital has been criticised by a coroner for ‘serious failings’ after a pensioner was found dead in a hospital toilet.

David Pattrick, 69, was discovered lying on the floor of a hospital toilet cubicle at Colchester General Hospital in Essex just two days after a gall bladder operation.

Colchester General Hospital is set to be investigated following a damning report into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust earlier this month.

It is one of 14 NHS trusts running 
eight hospitals are to be investigated because they have 'persistently 
high' death rates over the past two years.

Today coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray slammed the hospital for a number of failings in their care for the retired banker. 

Mr Pattrick, from Marks Tey, near Colchester, Essex, was admitted to the hospital in December 2010, to have his gall bladder removed after suffering severe gall stones.

Independent expert Jonathan Refson, consultant at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, criticised confusion over who was clinically responsible for Mr Pattrick during his hospital admission.

He told Chelmsford Coroners’ Court last week: 'Everyone popped in and popped out. No one took ownership of his care.'

Mr Pattrick continued to suffer from 
severe abdominal pain for two days after the operation as staff missed 
key signs he may have become septic.

On
the day of his death a foundation doctor who had just four months 
experience as a trainee doctor was put in charge of his care.

That evening Mr Pattrick was found collapsed in a toilet cubicle on December 23, 2010.

Coroner
Caroline Beasley-Murray today made a number of findings in relation to the 
case after accepting Mr Pattrick had died of natural causes from 
septicaemia.

She noted that Colchester Hospital had provided insufficient pre-operative counselling.

There was a failure of consultants to take responsibility of care and poor supervision of junior trainees.

Finally she said there was a failure of junior staff to escalate the problem to senior staff.

She concluded: 'There were serious failings in the care Mr Pattrick received during his stay at Colchester Hospital.

'It is pleasing to see Colchester Hospital appear to have now learnt lessons.'

Grieving widow Susan Pattrick, who is suing Colchester General Hospital for neglect, welcomed the damning verdict.

After the inquest she said: 'I’m very pleased with the verdict and the fact the coroner found serious failings.

'These are the things that need to be addressed.

'The NHS in general has a good reputation for dealing with people and this is, I hope, just an isolated incident.

'Unfortunately I think it is the system which caused my husband’s death.

'Modern wards now have a central desk with bays off it so nurses can’t see the patients and I think this is going to cause more and more problems in the future.

'I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I did.'

A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to offer our heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the family of Mr David Pattrick following his death in December 2010.

'We accept the Coroner’s verdict and are pleased that she acknowledged that the Trust has taken the issues raised by this case seriously, learned lessons and made improvements since Mr Pattrick died more than two years ago.

'For example, leave and cover arrangements for consultants have been made more robust, steps taken to ensure the results of any emergency investigations are reviewed at the earliest possible opportunity, and pain assessment training provided for healthcare assistants.

'Patient safety has always been and remains the highest priority for Colchester Hospital Trust.'
