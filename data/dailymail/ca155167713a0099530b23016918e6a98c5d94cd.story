In a sickening lecture to the crew of lawyers and victim's family members who were in the Guantanamo Bay court, the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks said the U.S. government had killed many more people in the name of national security than he is accused of killing.

Khalid Sheik Mohammed addressed the court on Wednesday during a pretrial hearing where he placed blame on the American government rather than accepting any ounce of guilt following his role in the terrorist attacks that killed 2,976 people.

'When the government feels sad for the death or the killing of 3,000 people who were killed on September 11, we also should feel sorry that the American government that was represented by (the chief prosecutor) and others have killed thousands of people, millions,' said Mohammed, who wore a military-style camouflage vest to the courtroom.

His lawyers said previously that Mohammed considers himself a prisoner of war and wanted to wear clothing similar to what he wore as a mujahedeen fighter.

The judge in his terrorism trial ruled 
Tuesday he could wear camouflage. The prison commander had previously 
forbidden it, but that was overturned by the judge, sparking outrage 
from victims families who saw the move as a way for him to send a message to fellow extremists.

He accused the United States of using
 an elastic definition of national security, comparable to the way 
dictators bend the law to justify their acts.

'Many can kill people under the name 
of national security, and to torture people under the name of national 
security, and to detain children under the name of national security, 
underage children,' he said in Arabic through an English interpreter.

'The president can take someone and 
throw him into the sea under the name of national security and so he can
 also legislate the assassinations under the name of national security 
for the American citizens,' he said in an apparent reference to the U.S.
 killing and burial at sea of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the 
U.S. use of drone strikes against U.S. citizens accused of conspiring 
with al Qaeda.

He advised the court against 'getting
 affected by the crocodile tears' and said, 'Your blood is not made out 
of gold and ours is made out of water. We are all human beings.'

The judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, 
gave Mohammed permission to speak and did not interrupt him, but said he
 would not hear any further personal comments from the defendants.

Mohammed's lecture to the court came 
during a week of pretrial hearings at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base
 in Cuba for him and four other captives accused of recruiting, funding 
and training the hijackers.

Under the Geneva Conventions, one of 
the things that separate soldiers from unlawful belligerents is the 
wearing of uniforms that distinguish them from civilians. Soldiers must 
also follow a clear command structure, carry arms openly and adhere to 
the laws of war.

Mohammed's defense attorney, Army 
Captain Jason Wright had argued that forbidding Mohammed from wearing 
military-style garb could undermine his presumption of innocence in the 
war crimes tribunal.

‘They are trying to use their 
situation to rally jihadists around the world and that puts American 
troops in danger,’ said Debra Burlingame, the sister of one of the 
pilots who died on September 11.

‘If these defendants were members of 
the Klu Klux Klan and they were on trial for killing a black family, for
 burning their house, would they be allowed to wear their Klan uniforms 
in court to show their solidarity with their fellow Klan members? 
Absolutely not!' she told MailOnline.

Mohammed and one other defendant attended the pretrial motions hearing for the military tribunal.

Three defendants chose to stay in 
their cells. The five are charged with planning and aiding the worst 
terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

The vest worn by Mohammed is one popular among hunters, but also has a seasonal appeal to many right now as company spokesman John Ottaviano told MailOnline that it is particularly popular as a part of military-inspired Halloween costumes.

With many camouflage patterns differing from type to type, the style that the 9/11 mastermind sported is thought to be the company's vintage camouflage range.

Mr Ottaviano was quick to point out that the 'vintage' label applies to the type of aesthetic wash that was used in its making, and not an implication that it was ever previously used as part of an American military uniform.

The suggested list price for such a vest, which uses a camouflage style called 'woodland', is $52.49.

Rothco, established in New York City in 1953, has previously held military contracts, but they do not hold any currently.

'We certainly aren't happy that he's 
chosen to wear our clothing into the court room much the same way Brooks
 Brothers would not be happy if a murderer wore their suit into court,'Mr  Ottaviano said.

The only stipulation that the judge, 
Army Col. James Pohl, made regarding the dress code for the five 
defendants is that the camouflage that they wear must not be U.S. 
military uniforms.

That said, The New York Post reports 
that the camouflage hunting vest used by Mohammed and his fellow 
detainee was made by Rothco, an American company that produces hunting 
and military gear.

A 
spokesman for Rothco, the military and survivalist clothing supplier, 
confirmed that they were not aware that their vest was going to be the 
one that helped Mohammed make his symbolic statement in court on 
Wednesday.

'We certainly aren't happy that he's 
chosen to wear our clothing into the court room much the same way Brooks
 Brothers would not be happy if a murderer wore their suit into court,' 
said John Ottaviano, director of the company's sales and marketing 
divisions.

The selection of a Rothco vest was in
 keeping with the judge's specification that the camouflage worn by the 
defendent not be a part of any U.S. military uniform, as the company 
does not have any current contracts with the armed forces and does not 
supply any of their standard-issue uniforms.

That said, the vest is a common item, as Mr Ottaviano told MailOnline that it could be found in any Army Navy store.

Mohammed's lawyer made a formal 
request to the judge asking to allow the camouflage because that is what
 Mohammed wore when he was part of the mujahedeen militia that fought to
 overthrow the Soviets.

‘These men are guilty of war crimes- you have to strip them of all those things that promotes their murderous cause,’ Mrs Burlingame said.

'I'm sympathetic because he’s under a 
microscope and he wants the proceedings  to be fair and to be perceived 
as fair and legitimate,’ explained Ms Burlingame, who is a former 
attorney,  ‘but he doesn’t have to take it when defence council and the 
defendants go over the line.’

‘It is the judge’s job to insure a 
fair trial for the defendants and prevent them from making propagandist 
statements from inside an American military courtroom.

‘They are speaking to Islamists 
members of al Qaeda and those who would be ripe for recruitment for 
their cause. They want to portray themselves as soldiers of Allah.’

Mohammed and his four co-defendants 
face charges that include terrorism, conspiracy and 2,976 counts of 
murder in violation of the law of war, one count for each known victim 
of the September 11 attacks at the time the charges were filed. They 
could get the death penalty if convicted.
