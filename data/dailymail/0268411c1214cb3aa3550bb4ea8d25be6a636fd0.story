A Florida cement facility worker is presumed dead after plummeting into a towering dry cement-filled silo that quickly filled with rainwater from the approaching Hurricane Isaac.

Officials and co-workers are still searching for the body of Pierre Mezidor, a 58-year-old Haitian father of two, after he was entombed Aug. 17 in what reportedly been described as, 'a horribly gruesome event.'

Macabre: Pictured here is the 200-foot-tall silo into which a worker plunged on Aug. 17 when its roof buckled and collapsed

Pierre Mezidor, a 58-year-old immigrant father of two, was standing atop the silo, measuring the quantity of dry cement inside, when the accident occurred

"His son is like collapsing inside," family friend Yolaine Casimier told Local 10 News outside Mr. Mezidor's Florida homestead.

Mr. Mezidor was reportedly standing atop the 200-foot silo located in Medley, Fla. around 8:30 a.m., measuring the level of dry cement inside, when the roof beneath him freakishly buckled and collapsed.

Along with the piecemeal roof, Mezidor reportedly fell some 140 feet into a silo that one fire official said was only 20 per cent full of dry cement at the time.

Rainwater from Tropical Storm Isaac quickly poured into the suddenly-open silo, not quite creating wet concrete, but rather a gooey mush that has bound to debris - and hampered recovery efforts.

"I just look at the situation myself, my head ready to blow and seeing that big thing," Casimier told Local 10 News.

"From what we see the situation he's not going to come out alive."

Casimier was reportedly one of the many friends and family members gathered at Mezidor's home Saturday, offering support to his wife, step-daughter and 16-year-old son.

Freakish Accident: The incident occurred at Titan America's Tarmac Cement Plant in Medley, Fla., which manufacturers dry cement

Mezidor had been working at the Tarmac Cement plant, which is owned by Titan America, for 19 years, according to Local 10 News. His step-daughter has said that he loved his job so much that he would go into work on his days off.

Titan America told The Miami Herald that company officials “deeply regret the incident and emphasize that employee safety is their primary concern.”

'I just look at the situation myself, my head ready to blow and seeing that big thing. From what we see the situation he's not going to come out alive.'

But family members have already hired an attorney in anticipation of filing a civil suit.

“This type of death in and of itself is unspeakable,” Edward Blumberg told The Herald, “and the family still does not have the closure of having a body.”

Miami-Dade Fire Rescue reportedly lowered sophisticated cameras and listening devices into the silo - devices sensitive enough to hear someone tapping -  but heard no signs of life.

"We have cadaver dogs that detect only dead people and we have live rescue dogs," MDFR Lt. Arnold Piedrahita told Local 10 NEws in the day. "Hopefully, with those dogs we will be able to determine whether this is going to be a recovery operation or continue as a rescue operation."

A Furious Search: Miami-Dade Fire Rescue has furiously searched for the fallen Mezidor with, among other things, cadaver-sniffing dogs, but to no avail
