Tragic: Elizabeth Yanez, 43, was stabbed to death in front of her children during a row over a parking space

Emergency services were called to the scene in Whittier and Ms Yanez was taken to UCI Medical Center with severe stab wounds. Despite doctors' best efforts, she later died.

Now, Cervantes and Rangel, both from South Los Angeles, have been arrested by police and charged with murder, according to a police release obtained by NBC Los Angeles.

Ms Yanez's son, Daniel Crable, who witnessed the stabbing, said his mother had been attacked at the popular Swap Meet at 13000 block of Alondra Boulevard  'because of a parking space'.

'It escalated,' he told KTLA 5. 'It went from one to 10 in a matter of seconds. The next thing you know this man is out of his car.'

Ms Yanez's daughter, Renee Crable, added: 'It doesn’t make sense to me. For a parking space, it was just uncalled for. I mean I just don’t understand how … I’m supposed to go on with my life now.'

Police arrested Cervantes and Rangel after obtaining 'crucial evidence' on the suspects, including fingerprints from the victims' car, following the attack at around 9.30pm. 

It remains unclear what type of stabbing implement was used in the alleged murder. 

Cervantes and Rangel are being held on $1million bond at the Los Angeles County Jail.
