Jessica Silva is accused of stabbing James Polkinghorne, 28, up to five times outside her family home in Marrickville in Sydney's inner west on Mother's Day in 2012

Silva cried on Monday as her trial heard recordings of a series of frantic phone calls she made to her brother Miguel in the hours before Mr Polkinghorne died.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Polkinghore text Ms Silva on Mother's Day calling her a 'f---ing slut', saying she deserved to be raped and threatening to come over to smash up her parents' house.

'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now,' Silva says in one call to her brother Miguel.

When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.'

'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'.

When Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside the family home that night, Miguel told the court he was 'screaming and carrying on' and that his sister was afraid for her and her family's life.

When Miguel went outside with his sister in an attempt to calm the situation, he alleged Mr Polkinghorne came quickly towards him.

'He tried to punch me. I think when I put my hand up, and he broke my finger,' Miguel added.

Moments later, the two men were on the ground with Mr Polkinghorne on top, grabbing Miguel near his throat, the court heard.

Jessica Silva reportedly used this knife to stab her ex-boyfriend to death

Mr Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death 

'Was he screaming out, `I'm going to get you, you f***ing c*** ... I'm going to kill youse (sic)'?' defence barrister Gregory Scragg asked.

'Yeah,' Miguel replied.

It wasn't until their father came outside to help wrestle Mr Polkinghorne to the ground that he saw blood everywhere and noticed the 28-year-old had a gash to his head, the court heard.

Miguel said his sister was the only person he saw with a knife that night.

She allegedly stabbed him four or five times to the back, shoulder and head and he died on the road while Miguel and Ms Silva's father restrained him. 

In the weeks before Mr Polkinghorne's death, Miguel told the court the 28-year-old had become increasingly paranoid from the drug 'ice'.

'The drugs had gotten to him really bad.'

The trial continues.
