Busted: Bryan Tilley, 51, admitted to scyberstalking his 22-year-old stepdaughter, police said

An Oregon stepfather landed in jail this past weekend after admitting to cyberstalking his stepdaughter, slashing her roommate’s tires and hijacking her social media accounts, police said.

Bryan Tilley, 51, of Keizer, terrorized the 22-year-old Oregon State University student for months because he wanted her to stop partying and seeing a guy he didn’t like, according to an affidavit. This is not the first time he’s found himself in trouble with the law.

The deranged man set up a fake email account under a false name and guessed the passwords to her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, investigators said. 

Mr Tilley admitted to accessing his step daughter’s Instagram account at least 44 times from October to December, said the affidavit first made public by the Corvallis Gazette Times.

He successfully guessed the password to all of her accounts and stole pictures from her personal computer, said the report.

The step father then used a Yahoo email address set up in the name of the male friend’s brother to make threats in order to scare her away from the guy and deflect blame, said the affidavit.

Mr Tilley then threatened to post the pictures on her social media accounts if she didn’t meet his demands – stop going out to bars and seeing the male friend.

Police say he followed through on the threat November 4 by posting pictures on her Instagram account.

Hacked: Mr Tilley also admitted to hacking into his daughter's Instagram account to post pictures and threats, cops said

He then took things a step further by using an ice pick to slash the tires of his step daughter’s roommate before posting on Instagram that hers were next, investigators found.

The torture would stop if she acquiesced to his demands.

Mr Tilley then broke into the stepdaughter’s apartment on January 3 and emptied a bottle of tequila. Police say he admitted he did not have permission to be there.

He was charged with first-degree burglary, identity theft, computer crime, felony coercion, third-degree theft and second-degree criminal mischief. Police arrested Mr Tilley Friday and booked him into jail. He bailed himself out on Sunday.

A MailOnline search of court records revealed Mr Tilley has a violent past.

The disturbed man received more than five years of probation after pleading guilty in 1988 to attempted murder, first-degree assault and felony public indecency.
