Resignation: Andrew Mitchell MP looking very damp as he made his way home this afternoon just hours before sending his letter of resignation

Andrew Mitchell sensationally quit as David Cameron’s chief whip last night –  exactly a month after launching a foul-mouthed tirade at police officers in  Downing Street.

Mr Mitchell travelled to Chequers at 4pm yesterday to tell the Prime Minister  he had lost the confidence of Tory MPs and was resigning immediately after just  six weeks in the job.

The move came after senior ministers, including Theresa May, Iain Duncan Smith  and Mr Mitchell’s own deputy John Randall told him his position was untenable.

His departure caps another dismal week for the Government, in which good news on unemployment was overshadowed by a shambolic announcement on energy bills and revelations last night that the Chancellor George Osborne had been caught  travelling in a first class rail carriage with a standard ticket.

In an extraordinary resignation letter Mr Mitchell denied calling police officers ‘plebs’, as they have claimed, but admitted swearing at them, telling the Prime Minister he had said: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to ****ing  help us.’

This appears to contradict an appearance in the Commons earlier this week when he was seen mouthing the words ‘I didn’t swear’.

He said in his letter: ‘Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfil my duties as we would both wish.’

Senior Tories were last night hoping his departure would draw a line under the damaging affair, which has revived the toxic suggestion that the party does not care about ordinary people.

But it raises serious questions about the Prime Minister’s judgment in trying  to shield Mr Mitchell in the first place.

Quit: The letter Mitchell sent to David Cameron as he handed in his resignation today

Denial: Despite his resignation Andrew Mitchell maintains that he didn't call a police officer a 'pleb'

Calling for his head: Labour leader Ed Miliband had urged the Tories to sack Mitchell and even called for him to be arrested

Last night former Commons Leader Sir George Young was brought back into Cabinet as Chief Whip.

The appointment will avert the need 
for Mr Cameron to make other changes as Sir George does not currently 
hold a ministerial post.

The Tory grandee was thought to have 
retired to the backbenches after giving up his position as Leader of the
House to make way for former health secretary Andrew Lansley.

Sir George has been an MP since 1974 and held a variety of ministerial posts in the 1980s and 1990s.

Mr Cameron had repeatedly defended Mr Mitchell, saying that although his outburst had been unacceptable, he had apologised.

But the row refused to die down, with the Police Federation, Labour, and many Tories continuing to press for the Chief Whip to go.

Theresa May and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith are understood to have been instrumental in Mr Mitchell’s departure.

A Cabinet source said the pair had been ‘deeply unimpressed’ by his outburst.

Mr Mitchell’s deputy John Randall was also a key figure in his downfall but other members of the whips’ office also made clear their unhappiness at  having to work under Mr Mitchell.

‘Andrew has had a succession of colleagues coming to him since Parliament  returned this week saying they think it would be difficult for him to go on,’  said the Cabinet source.

A Downing Street source said: ‘The Prime Minister’s view of the original episode was that he had apologised, and most importantly the police officer concerned had accepted that apology.

‘But Andrew Mitchell had come to the conclusion that he was unable to continue to do his job properly, which is a different issue.’

Mr Mitchell’s resignation came exactly a month after he lost his temper with police officers who stopped him riding his bicycle out of the gates of Downing  Street.

In a police report, the officer involved said Mr Mitchell  told him: ‘Best you learn your ****ing place. You don’t run this ****ing  government. You’re ****ing plebs.’ He then added: ‘You haven’t heard the last of this.’

In his resignation letter he maintained that his outburst had not been as bad as portrayed.

The Prime Minister said he was ‘sorry’ to lose Mr Mitchell but understood why he was leaving.

Michael Dugher MP, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister said: ‘What  people will want to know is why, when the entire country could see that what Andrew Mitchell did was wrong, the Prime Minister totally failed to act.'

Dear David,

It is with enormous regret - not least because of the tremendous support and loyalty you have shown me during recent weeks - that I am writing to resign as your Chief Whip.

Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfil my duties as we both would wish. Nor is it fair to continue to put my family and colleagues through this upsetting and damaging publicity.

I have made clear to you - and I give you my categorical assurance again - that I did not, never have, and never would call a police officer a "pleb" or a "moron" or used any of the other pejorative descriptions attributed to me.

The offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark "I thought you guys were supposed to f***ing help us".

It was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and I am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology.

I am immensely grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to serve as your Development Secretary for seven and a half years, both in Opposition and in Government.

I believe Britain, under your leadership, has made real progress in transforming the lives and the opportunities of some of the world's poorest people and that we will continue to do so as we deploy an expertise and commitment which show Britain at its best.

I now intend to concentrate on serving my constituents in the Royal town of Sutton Coldfield to the best of my ability and giving you the strong support you rightly deserve from all members of the Conservative Party.

With every good wish,

yours ever,

Andrew Mitchell.

Dear Andrew,

Thank you for your letter. I was sorry to receive it, but I
understand why you have reached the conclusion that you have, and why you have
decided to resign from the Government.

I regret that this has become necessary, and am very
grateful for all you have done, both in Government and in Opposition - as well
as for the kind words in your letter.

I am in no doubt that your work in the field of
international development has made a really important contribution - not only
to the Conservative Party, but more importantly to Britain's standing in the
world, and above all to international efforts to tackle deep and sustained
poverty.

You brought real passion to the job in Opposition, which you
turned into more than two years of very successful work in Government.

You brought immense energy and dedication to the role, a
focus on the world's poorest, and decisive progress on the key issues of
vaccination against preventable diseases, maternal health and family planning
that make the greatest difference to the greatest number of people.

You have also brought a proper accountability and
transparency to the Department for International Development's work.

Under your leadership of the Department, Britain achieved a
leading global role, which will be continued as Britain chairs the United
Nations High Level Panel.

As we discussed in advance of the reshuffle, I wanted you to
bring your organisational skill and energy to the important job of Chief Whip.
It was clear to me that you had already made a strong start.

As you have acknowledged, the incident in Downing Street was
not acceptable and you were right to apologise for it.

You have much to be proud of from your service on the
Frontbench both in Opposition and in Government, and in your continued service
to your constituents in Sutton Coldfield. I hope that, in time, you will be
able to make a further contribution to public life.

Yours

David
