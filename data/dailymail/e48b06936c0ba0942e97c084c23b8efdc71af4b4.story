NHS managers are refusing to let GPs send patients for vital scans to detect cancer.

Family doctors are meant to be allowed to refer patients directly for tests and X-rays without having to first go to a hospital specialist, as part of a government drive to speed up diagnosis.

But an investigation has found that two-thirds of NHS organisations do not allow GPs to send patients for at least one of four crucial scans to spot cancers with low survival rates.

Of these two thirds, 50 per cent do not allow doctors to send patients directly for scans to detect bowel cancer, while 50 per cent do not allow doctors to send patients for scans to detect brain cancer.

GP patients face a "postcode lottery" due to restrictions imposed by some clinical commissioning groups, the research found

Some 27 per cent do not give them direct access to checks for ovarian cancer, while 25 per cent do not let them send patients for chest X-rays for lung cancer, which is often diagnosed too late. Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Western Europe and in 2011 the Government pledged to improve this by investing £450million to give GPs better access to scans.

These included MRI scans for brain cancer, chest X-rays for lung cancer, flexible sigmoidoscopy tests for bowel cancer and ultrasounds for ovarian cancer.

Politicians stated that GPs would be allowed to order these tests to be carried out themselves – rather than having to send patients first to a hospital consultant – in the hope of speeding up diagnosis time by several weeks. However, Freedom of Information requests by GP magazine found that only a third give doctors direct access to all four scans.

In fact, a fifth of the 211 GP-run Clinical Commissioning Groups do not let them refer patients for any of these tests.

Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP Committee, said: ‘It’s frustrating. There’s been an increase in pressure on what should be done within the community, but for GPs to be empowered to be able to do that, we need the support services and particularly access to diagnostics.

‘There’s no real reason other than cost that prohibits access to services. But in many cases, it actually reduces costs overall if you enable GPs to have greater access to these types of services, because they can avoid making potentially unnecessary referrals.’

Earlier this week the NHS watchdog Nice issued detailed guidance to GPs on diagnosing cancer over concerns that failure to spot the disease early enough are costing thousands of lives a year.

It told doctors to refer patients for tests within 48 hours if they had symptoms including persistent tiredness, a cough or unexplained bruising. Last month it emerged that the chances of beating cancer in England still lag behind those elsewhere in Europe. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that in 2012 the percentage of patients still alive five years after diagnosis had improved for 19 of the most common cancers, compared to the situation in 2011.

But for five types they stalled or got worse, including bladder cancer in women, thyroid cancer in both sexes, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women and mesothelioma in men. There is no explanation as to why – and in all cases it has only been a very small decline.

However, waiting times for vital tests to diagnose cancer have gone up recently as the NHS struggles with the rise in patients. Campaigners said that, despite overall improvement, England is well behind France, Germany and Scandinavia in its survival rates. This has been blamed on GPs missing symptoms, and patients not making an appointment when they first experience them.
