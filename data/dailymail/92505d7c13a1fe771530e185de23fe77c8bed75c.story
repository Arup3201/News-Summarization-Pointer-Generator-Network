For transgender Cubans, life on the Island of Freedom has long been a struggle - a daily battle against poverty and entrenched discrimination.

But as a new book of photographs titled TransCuba shows, there is now a light at the end of the tunnel for the island's fledgling LGBT community.

Mariette Pathy Allen, a New York-based artist and photographer, has spent the past 35 years documenting and advocating for transgender people in U.S.

In 2012, Allen attended a symposium in Cuba about transgender identify and culture organized by Mariela Castro Espin, head of the Cuba National Center of Sex Education - and the daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro.

Young love: Nomi and Miguel, partners, watching television at Malu's apartment in Havana

Life on the sidelines: Many transgender Cubans, like Laura (pictured), live below the poverty line because they cannot find steady work

Defiant: Alsola spent two years studying psychology and medicine at a school in Santiago de Cuba, but dropped out rather than conform to the school¿s dress code requiring students to wear clothes appropriate for their birth gender

Hard living: Amanda, a 36-year-old HIV-positive prostitute, tried twice to get to the U.S., and twice failed. She was taken to Guantanamo Bay, where she begged her captors to return her to Havana

Allen 
decided to spend some time in Havana following the conference, and in 
her travels she befriended a pair of transgender cabaret performers, 
Amanda and Nomi.

Allen's
 new friends introduced her to the local transgender community, which 
she began documenting by taking pictures of the women in the privacy of 
their homes, at work and interacting with friends and family.

The
 veteran photographer said initially she had no plans to turn her 
snapshots into a large-scale project, but after she showed some of her 
work at Fotofest in  Houston, she was approached by the publishing house
 Daylight Books about doing a book shining a spotlight on Cuba's 
transgender community. 

Allen
 made two subsequent trips to Cuba, traveling around the capital and 
beyond and documenting life from the point of view of transgender 
people. Allen's striking images featured in TransCuba show most of her subjects living below the poverty line.

Under
 Fidel Castro, Cuba's revolutionary leader who transferred power to his 
younger brother, Raul, in 2008 after 50 years at the helm, homosexuals 
and transgender people were treated as social deviants and ostracized by
 society.

In
 the 1960s, gay Cubans were banned from serving in the military or 
becoming teachers, and thousands of them were shipped off to labor 
camps, reported Mother Jones. At the height of the AIDS epidemic In the 80s and 90s, and those 
who contracted HIV were quarantined.

Mariette Pathy Allen traveled to Cuba for the first time in 2012 and became friends with two transgender women, who then introduced her to others in the community like Erika, pictured with her boyfriend in Cienfuegos

Unprecedented access: Working on her book, Allen got a chance to hang out with transgender women, photograph them at home and with their friends and relatives

Two
 years after his retirement, Fidel Castro said in an interview with the 
Mexican newspaper La Jornada that imprisoning gay people was ‘a great 
injustice,’ for which he was to blame. 

Since
 becoming president of the republic six years ago, Raul Castro has 
enacted sweeping reforms to boost the island nation's floundering 
economy and bring it into the 21st century by allowing its citizens 
greater personal freedoms.  

Under
 Castro, Cuba's LGBT community has slowly begun coming out of the 
shadows, with the president’s own daughter, Castro Espin, emerging as a 
leading advocate for the rights of gay and transgender people.

It
 was Castro Espin who in 2008 persuaded the Cuban government to legalize
 gender reassignment surgery, but transgender people still face 
discrimination in the workforce, and many turn to prostitution to eke 
out a meagre living.  

‘I
 see transgender Cubans as a metaphor for Cuba itself: people living 
between genders in a country moving between doctrines,’ Allen writes.

Mariette
 Pathy Allen's transgender women are strong and optimistic about the 
future, but they continue to face great challenges, from HIV to lack of 
work and deep-seated intolerance pervading Cuba’s society.

Important volume: Allen's TransCuba, which was published in April, includes 80 color photographs accompanied by a personal essay and interviews

One of TransCuba’s subjects, Natalie, was denied a factory job because of the way she looked and started turning tricks, which resulted in her contracting HIV and getting arrested.

Amanda, a 36-year-old HIV-positive prostitute, tried twice to get to the U.S., and twice failed. She was taken to Guantánamo Bay, where she begged her captors to return her to the streets of Havana.

Another subject, Alsola, spent two years studying psychology and medicine at a school in Santiago de Cuba, but dropped out rather than conform to the school’s dress code requiring students to wear clothes appropriate for their birth gender.

TransCuba, which was published in April, includes 80 color photographs accompanied by a personal essay and interviews.
