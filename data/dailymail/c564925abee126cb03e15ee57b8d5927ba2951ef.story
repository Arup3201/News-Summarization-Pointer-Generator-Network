The longest pay squeeze in history could finally be over, with millions of workers expected to receive pay rises which beat inflation this year, experts said yesterday.

For the past five years, the average worker’s pay rise has been far below the rate of inflation, an unprecedented squeeze which has left people struggling to cope with soaring household bills.

The Office for National Statistics said yesterday inflation dropped to 2 per cent in December – the first time it has been at or below the Government’s target of 2 per cent since November 2009.

Private sector bosses expect to reward their workers with an average pay rise of 2.5 per cent this year.

This would represent the first inflation-beating pay rise since the financial crisis began. At present, private sector workers are getting average pay rises of just 1.3 per cent.

Andrew Goodwin, a senior economic adviser to the accountants, Ernst & Young’s Item Club, said: ‘It has been a long road, but after a gap of four years we’re finally back at the 2 per cent target.’

Rob Harbron, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: ‘With a more benign inflation outlook ahead, the coming 12 months could see the first return to  sustained increases in real wages since the financial crisis.’ 

Chris Williamson, chief economist at the consultancy Markit, added: ‘A return to real wages growth is becoming a distinct possibility for 2014.’

The squeeze on families has been long and painful. Yesterday the ONS said the cost of food and soft drinks had grown at a faster rate than inflation for ‘each of the last eight years’.

It is a trend which has pushed many families to cut back on the amount of food they buy, or to switch to cheaper supermarkets, such as Aldi and Lidl.

There is growing pressure on bosses to reward workers with a proper pay rise, with millions of workers earning less today than they did when the financial crisis began after pay has been adjusted for inflation.

Chancellor George Osborne said yesterday: ‘You see in the inflation numbers that the economic plan is working for people.

‘Inflation is at its lowest level for four years. It’s on target and it’s by working through our economic plan that we can deliver for people, deliver the economic security and peace of mind that people want in this country.’ 

Anne Sharp, chief executive of Acas, the employment relations service, said: ‘While the economy is showing signs of recovery, pay may well loom large on the employment relations agenda in 2014 as workers look to catch up for past pay restraint.’

House prices are nearly 80 per cent higher in London than they are in the rest of the country, according to the ONS.

While house prices rose by 5.4 per cent in the UK in the 12 months to November 2013, they rose by only 3.1 per cent if London and the South East is excluded.

The ONS said house prices in London had jumped by 11.6 per cent over the last year.

The figures make clear how London’s rampant house price inflation affects the figures for the whole of the country.Stephen Smith, director of housing at the insurer, Legal & General, said: ‘It is important to consider the overall picture.

‘While London and the South East have been forging ahead with exponential growth, prices in the rest of the country have risen at a much slower rate.’
