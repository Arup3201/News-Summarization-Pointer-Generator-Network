When Jason Carrasco was cleared of cancer, he wanted to share the good news with his best friend who was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour.

But in a cruel twist, Cass Nascimento had relapsed with another brain tumour and sadly passed away in November last year.

The pair, from Wollongong in New South Wales, met in their teenage years when Nascimento would visit Carrasco and through it, they formed a special friendship and battled each hurdle side-by-side.

Appearing on Channel Seven’s Sunday Night on Sunday, Carrasco reveals the heartbreaking story of an inspiring girl he fell in love with before she lost her three year battle fighting cancer.

Jason Carrasco and Cass Nascimento shared a special bond while battling cancer during their teenage years

‘The day they told me that I was cleared of my cancer, that same day Cass went for her standard three-monthly check-up and the next day she was diagnosed with another brain mass that had come back in two parts of her brain,’ he told Sunday Night.

‘Cassie and I have never really had a time when one of us hasn’t been fighting. It was really hard.

'I couldn't imagine a world without Cass. I mean, she'd done so much for me.'

Every day for two years, Nascimento would visit him and through it, they formed a special bond

Nascimento was 16-years-old when she had three brain operations, chemotherapy and radiation but despite her own battles, she wanted to share her experience and help give Carrasco strength.

'Personally I didn’t find this strength on my own. It was the quality that grew from my support network and my friendship with Cass,' he posted on Mamamia.

'It was that text message asking how I was; it was those countless hours she spent with me holding my hand reassuring that this too would pass.'

'She would say things like ‘I wish I could take your pain’ but her presence made me feel invincible. Anything was possible as long as we were together,' he told Sunday Night.

Despite their cancer battle, Carrasco revealed he had always appreciated Nascimento from afar and told all his friends that she's the 'hot girl' but  was too shy to approach her.

'She was one of those girls who you could never talk to face-to-face because she was too hot,' he told Sunday Night.

But since her death, Carrasco said she had 'touched many people's lives' and her 'experiences will go on to help others'.

'I thank you for everything you’ve ever done for me. I am so sorry, Cass, I couldn’t save you like you saved me. I really am.'

Nascimento said in one footage before: 'Being diagnosed and going through everything, kind of learned that life's so short and you could be gone at any moment.

While children are treated in their own cancer wards, Nascimento revealed how difficult it was when the pair were treated alongside older patients.

But two years ago, the pair became ambassadors for the Sony Foundation's youth cancer program, You Can, in a bid to build cancer wards for young adults between 16-24 in Australia.

The first You Can Cancer Centre opened at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth a year ago.

Nascimento went to America for an experimental treatment but in October last year, she collapsed after a scan revealed the cancer had spread throughout her brain

Nascimento went to America for an experimental treatment but in October last year, she collapsed after a scan revealed the cancer had spread throughout her brain. 

The doctors told her family and friends that she didn't have much longer to live and she lost her brave battle at 19 on November 11, 2013.

'Towards the end Cass couldn't do much and I wanted to make her laugh, make her feel better,' he told Sunday Night.

'She used to say to me that, every night she would hear her mum in her room crying and that she never used to say anything or never used to complain because she loved her mum so much that she didn't want her mum to be in anymore pain.

'I honestly believe the reason why Cass was the way she was, and dealt with everything was because of the example her mother set for her.

'With my battle over, now I just want all young people to have the chance to be that Cass for someone. To save other people lives, just like Cass saved mine,' he told Mamamia.
