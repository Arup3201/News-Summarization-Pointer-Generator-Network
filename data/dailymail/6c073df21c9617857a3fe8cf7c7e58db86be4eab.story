A secret government report has revealed that thousands of migrants from the European Union have tried to claim British state handouts through bogus marriages and fraudulent welfare claims.

Immigrants have also used false documents and lied about being related to EU citizens in order to cheat their way to UK taxpayers' money, the unpublished Home Office report states.

Criminal gangs have even smuggled people into Britain, forced them to open bank accounts so they can claim benefits before taking the money and leaving them penniless and forced to beg on the streets, according to the dossier.

The report, which has been seen by The Sunday Telegraph, has highlighted the exploitation of 'free movement' immigration rights given to EU citizens, allowing them to move anywhere withing the EU to work.

It has prompted ministers into a five-year push to convince leaders in Brussels that action must be taken to halt this abuse.

The document, entitled Evidence of Fraud and Abuse of Free Movement in the UK, was submitted to the European Commission by Home Secretary Theresa May last year in response to a request for evidence of the scale of abuse of the free movement rights.

After being given documentation from governments across the EU the Commission found that 'robust safeguards' already in place to ensure the free movement rights were not being abused.

The Home Office report was supposed to have been published last week, prior to Thursday's Commons debate over the Immigration Bill, but was delayed.

David Cameron was embarrassingly forced to rely on Labour and Liberal Democrat votes to face down a mass rebellion by his backbenchers over immigration.

The
 Prime Minister appeared unable to control his party as 86 Tory MPs 
voted to stop foreign prisoners using the right to a family life in the 
Human Rights Act to stay in Britain.

In a further blow, the Conservative Party's attempts to pass legislation 
guaranteeing a referendum on Britain’s EU membership was killed
 off by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords on Friday.

The government have been accused of attempting to conceal evidence by delaying the publication of the report, with some Tory MPs saying it should have released so it could be discussed in parliament.

Instead the document is expected to be published this week as part of an EU scrutiny select committee report - too late for it to it to be read by MPs debating the Bill.

According to the report, the principle ways migrants, both from Europe and elsewhere, abuse the free movement for workers right granted to EU citzens is through sham and proxy marriages, benefit fraud and false documents.

Concerns were raised over 1,891 suspected sham marriages involving people applying to live in Britain after marriage to a UK or EU citizen in 2012

Concerns were raised over 1,891 suspected sham marriages involving people applying to live in Britain after marriage to a UK or EU citizen in 2012, according the The Sunday Telegraph - an increase of 957 from 2010.

Currently there are 23 police probes either being carried out, or in the planning stages into sham marriage rings linked to criminal gangs in the  North West of England, while a London vicar earned £30,000 through officiating almost 250 sham marriages.

Marriage registrations carried out by proxy, in which one or even both partners are represented by another person in their absence, are legal in some countries and in a study of 200 EU residence card applications in October 2013 revealed 16 per cent of all marriage certificates put forward as supporting evidence had been from proxy marriages.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said the dossier had been shown to MPs on the EU scrunity committee

A criminal network which used proxy marriage certificates and fake or stolen ID cards to try to get people into Britain illegally was also uncovered in a separate investigation.

According to the newspaper, a Romanian gang trafficked more than 1,000 children into the UK - forcing them into theft, begging and benefit fraud.

The Metropolitan Police’s Operation Golf uncovered a £2.9 million benefit fraud scam by a Romanian gang, while in other cases, having been convinced to come to the UK drug addicts and people with mental health issues were forced to open bank accounts to receive falsely claimed state handouts.

'It is clear that criminal gangs exploit the free movement rights of EU citizens in order to facilitate significant fraud against the UK benefits system,' the report states.

The report also says that 83 per cent of the 1,652 false papers seized at ports and airports by border officials in 2012 were either from the EU or the European 
Economic Area, made up of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway from the 
European Free Trade Association and 27 member states of the EU.

This had risen from 73 per cent of the 1,770 fraudulent documents seized in 2009.

Conservative MP Nigel Mills, who represents Amber Valley in Derbyshire, questioned why the Home Office report was not published at the same time as it was put to the European Commission, and priot to the debate over the Immigration Bill.

'If there is some reason why it hasn’t been published, we ought to hear it because it is going to look very suspicious to a lot of people,' he said.

Although the dossier has not been made public, Immigration Minister Mark Harper said it had been shown to MPs on the EU scrunity committee.

In a statement given to MailOnline he said: 'Years of pressure from the UK and other Member States that share our views has forced the European Commission to finally acknowledge that free movement abuse is a genuine EU problem. 

'This document was created as part of evidence provided to the EU Commission outlining these concerns. I have also shared this document with the European Scrutiny Committees in both houses for further consideration.

'The government is clear that EU citizens who benefit from the right to free movement must adhere to the responsibilities this brings with it. We will not tolerate the abuse of free movement rights and are working at a domestic level and with other Member States to tackle such abuse.'
