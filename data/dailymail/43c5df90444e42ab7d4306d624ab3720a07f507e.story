She was a former showgirl turned exuberant socialite who acquired a taste for the high life through a succession of marriages to wealthy businessmen.

Little wonder that a car designed by Lady Docker was a monument to extravagance, from its royal blue crocodile skin trim, hand-woven silk upholstery and a silver mascot modelled on her naked body.

Now her Daimler DK400 ‘Stardust’ limousine is expected to fetch up to £160,000 when it is auctioned on Saturday.

Extravagant: The exterior of the royal blue limousine, designed by Lady Docker to revive a struggling Daimler, is finished with 5,000 hand-painted silver stars

Lavish: The 1954 vehicle features hand-woven silk upholstery, aluminium cabinets trimmed with blue crocodile skin and electronic double-glazed windows

Luxurious: Lady Docker, pictured powdering her face in the back of the 'Stardust' Daimler, wanted to transform the car company's staid image in post-war Britain

The 
restored 1954 vehicle is one of five cars commissioned and styled by 
Lady Docker, hallmarked with what Bonhams auctioneers call 
‘awe-inspiring excess’.

Lady
 Docker put her own stamp on the car in an attempt to dust off the drab,
 stuffy image she believed was blighting her husband’s Daimler firm in 
post-war Britain. But it was so outrageously ambitious it cost company 
chairman Sir Bernard Docker his job and nearly bankrupted the company.

Although
 Daimler was a long-time favourite of the Royal Family, Lady Docker told
 her husband it could not survive on status alone and convinced him the 
firm needed ‘shaking up’.The car cost £12,500 to transform, far more 
than the cost of a good semi-detached house in those days.

It
 has 5,000 stars hand-painted in silver on the coachwork and Lady Docker
 chose hand-woven grey silk brocatelle for the rear upholstery 
(declaring that ‘mink is too hot to sit on’). Four crocodile skin 
suitcases were tailored to fit the boot.

The
 couple used the car at the wedding of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of
 Monaco and their invitations are offered for sale with the car at the 
auction in Chichester, West Sussex.

The
 ‘Docker Specials’ never caught on in austere post-war Britain, although
 a more understated model was later built for the Queen Mother. Sir 
Bernard, accused of allowing his wife to build the car for her own 
amusement, was voted out of office.

They were later expelled from their Monaco home and Lady Docker died almost penniless in a London hotel in 1983.

Bespoke: The blue crocodile trim interior is finished with a specially-designed clock face. The car was so expensive to make that it nearly bankrupted the company

Muse: The limousine's dancer mascot, left, was modelled on former dancer Lady Docker's figure. The car's chauffeur's front seat, right, was more cramped

Royal favourite: The 'Stardust' was shipped to France for the wedding of Prince Rainier of Monaco and film star Grace Kelly, which Lord and Lady Docker attended

Spacious: The pale pink hand-woven silk upholstery on the back seat contrasts prettily with the custom blue crocodile skin trim, which is bathed in light from the sunroof

Excessive: Its royal blue coachwork was bodied by coachbuilder Hooper & Co for £12,500 - more than the average price for a semi-detached house at the time

Smooth ride: The 4.6 litre six cylinder engine made sure that passengers could sip champagne on the backseat without spilling
