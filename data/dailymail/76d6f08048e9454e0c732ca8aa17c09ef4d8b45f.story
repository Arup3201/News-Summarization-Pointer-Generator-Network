The Sir Alex Ferguson swipeometer, for years the unofficial barometer of a Premier League club's success, has sadly been mothballed following the former Manchester United manager's retirement.

For years it was Liverpool who found themselves at the receiving end of Ferguson's caustic comments, until they stopped being a threat.

Arsenal's Arsene Wenger appeared only to have to smile his enigmatic smile to rile the managerial Godfather of England.

When it came to the 'other' club in Manchester, however, well they were miles off Ferguson's radar for years.

Then along came a Middle East takeover, some serious spending and a genuine rivalry for silverware and Manchester City were paid the biggest compliment of all – Ferguson described them as 'small with a small mentality' and branded them the 'noisy neighbours'.

That was the point that City finally got under the skin of a manager who could see the axis of power shifting to the east of Manchester.

Admittedly, the decision to plaster a huge poster of ex-United striker Carlos Tevez all over Deansgate with a 'welcome to Manchester' message was pretty well guaranteed to irritate Ferguson and everyone at Old Trafford.

Talking the talk has evolved into walking the walk. Look at the Premier League table for the last four years and it has a very northern hue. City or United, United or City.

Ferguson has gone, David Moyes has come and gone, Roberto Mancini has gone and now it is Louis van Gaal versus Manuel Pellegrini.

After decades of living in United's shadow, the Premier League champions are now the best team in the city

United are in a lowly eighth place on 13 points while City are in third but only four points better off. No-one would suggest that City are the poor relations any more. The reverse could be argued.

Yet it was only in 2001 that the clubs reached a fork in the road which would see City relegated while United went from strength to strength on the back of their 1999 treble-winning season.

Most people would remember 2001 and Old Trafford for Roy Keane's assault on Alf-Inge Haaland but it was also the season City slipped out of the Premier League.

Even though United did not regard their noisy neighbours as a serious threat in terms of League position, local bragging rights were just as important.

There have been some memorable derbies, not always for the right reasons. Rio Ferdinand's bleeding head from a thrown coin blighted the 2012 meeting in which Joe Hart also tackled a pitch invader after Robin van Persie's late winner to make it 3-1.

City fans will remember the 2007-8 season with fondness as that was the first double since 1969 when Marvin Gaye was hearing it through the grapevine and George Best was taking delivery of a brand new Lotus Europa, whatever that is.

Two years later the derby was labelled the best Premier League game of the season. United 4, City 3 with Michael Owen scoring the winner in the fifth minute of injury time.

Owen said recently, annoyingly referring to himself in the first person: 'I think if you ask any United fan what was the best ¬moment of Michael Owen's time here they'd all say that derby goal – and it's probably the stand-out moment for me too.

'It's a special memory because it won us a memorable derby and was in front of the Stretford End – the fans don't forget something like that.'

Neither do the players. Wayne Rooney, who appeared close to signing for City at one point until he was given a bumper new deal by United, settled the Old Trafford clash in 2010-11 with a bicycle kick.

This is how he described it in his autobiography: 'I'm Wayne Rooney. I've played Premier League football since 2002 and I've just scored the winning goal in a Manchester derby – probably the most important game of the season to fans from the red half of town.

'A goal that puts our noisy neighbours – the other lot – in their place. A goal that reminds them United have more history and more success than they do right now. A goal that warns the rest of the country we're on our way to winning another Premier League title.

'As I stand with my arms spread wide, head back, I can feel the hate coming from the City fans behind me, it's like static electricity. The abuse, the screaming and swearing, is bouncing off me. I don't give a toss.

'I know how much they hate me; I can understand where they are coming from though, because I go through the same emotions whenever I lose at anything.

'This time, they're wound up and I'm not. I know it doesn't get any better than this.

'As I jog back to the centre circle, still tingling, I go into rewind. It's ridiculous, I know, but I'm worried I might never feel this way again. I want to remember what's just happened, to relive the moment over and over because it feels so good.'

Back to City and another hugely important result. Yaya Toure stopped United from reaching a ninth FA Cup final as City went on to win their first major trophy since 1976. (Brotherhood of Man top fo the charts with 'Save your Kisses for Me').

The to-ing and fro-ing continues with United taking FA Cup revenge in 2011-12 while City made the biggest noise of all when they thumped Ferguson and Co 6-1 at Old Trafford.

Jonny Evans was sent off and City scored three goals in injury time. A certain Mario Balotelli grabbed two, just after letting off fireworks in his house, while Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and David Silva chipped in as well.

And so to Sunday, where there may be fireworks but no flares, please.
