The Co-op Bank has been accused of ‘blatant sexism’ after downgrading the role of a female high-flyer whose affair with its chief executive posed a conflict of interest.

Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that headhunter Samantha Davenport, the bank’s ‘Head of Talent’, is in a relationship with married boss Niall Booker, despite having a key role in appointing the directors and chairman supposed to hold him to account.

The Co-op admitted there was a ‘potential’ conflict of interest and said it would take steps to tackle it.

But the troubled bank’s solution was to strip 44-year-old Miss Davenport of any role in the appointment process for the board – a move condemned by MPs and City women’s groups as ‘discriminatory and unjust.’

Tory MP Nadine Dorries said that the Co-op had failed to uphold its own ethical standards. ‘The fact they have stripped her of responsibility and let him carry on is blatant sexism. We are entitled to expect more from a bank which holds itself up as “ethical”.’

She added that it was a chief executive’s job to be aware of potential conflicts of interests; so it was his duty to report the affair to his board, not hers.

Lindsay Loxley of the Women in Business Network agreed, saying: ‘It’s discriminatory and unfair – it’s always the woman who has to make the compromise. It’s sexist.’

And Gwen Rhys of campaigning group Women In The City added: ‘This is a sorry tale and both parties were rather naive if they thought that their affair wouldn’t have negative consequences.

‘But quite why Ms Davenport should take the “hit” of having her job watered down while Mr Booker can carry on unaffected doesn’t, on the face of it, strike me as equitable.’

A spokesman for Co-op Bank said last night: ‘Sam Davenport now has no role in the recruitment of the new chairman and future directors at the bank.

Affair: Last week, we revealed that on a working Friday, Mr Booker, 55, and  Miss Davenport emerged from her west London home at 2.30pm and turned up at their office in the City at 3.30pm

‘This decision is role-based, not gender-based, and there is no question of sexism. If the Head of Talent had been a man and the CEO a woman, then it would have been the man whose job would have been slightly impacted.’

How The Mail on Sunday reported the news that the married  Co-op bank chief was having an affair

Despite its claims to the contrary, the Bank also felt the conflict of interest was serious enough to report it to the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. Neither the Bank nor the FCA would comment on whether that step was taken before or after our report.

Last week, we revealed that on a working Friday, £2.9 million-a-year Mr Booker, 55, and divorced mother-of-three Miss Davenport emerged from her west London home at 2.30pm and turned up at their office in the City at 3.30pm.

The Co-op’s handling of the issue echoes a similar situation at insurance giant Aviva in 2009

Then its £1.8 million-a-year chief executive Andrew Moss had an affair with colleague Deidre Galvin, who was married to the company’s human resources chief.

Shortly before the affair emerged, only Miss Galvin resigned ‘by mutual agreement and in order to avoid any apparent conflict’.
