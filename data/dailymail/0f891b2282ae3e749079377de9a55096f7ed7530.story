The body of Sylvester Stallone's son laid undiscovered for at least three to four days before being found Friday in his Los Angeles home, according to new reports.

Coroner's officials are still investigating the death of 36-year-old Sage Stallone who is understood to have overdosed on prescription pills found at the scene.

According to TMZ, the filmmaker 'lived like Howard Hughes' in a room 'littered with junk' - and his body could have laid cold for as long as a week.

A source told the website Sage was 
living like a recluse at his Studio City home, and had not spoken to his 
family for a week before his body was discovered.

A housekeeper who is believed to have
been at the residence earlier in the week was reported to have 
been instructed never to enter his room, which a law enforcement source 
described as 'disgusting' and foul-smelling. 

Sage's mother, Sasha Czack, is said 
to have called the housekeeper on Friday to check on him after she was 
unable to reach her son. That is when the body was discovered, according
to TMZ.

A friend of Sylvester Stallone's late
son has meanwhile disputed reports the 36-year-old committed suicide, saying he 
was 'healthy and upbeat' just two weeks before his sudden death.

As coroner's officials investigate if 
the death was accidental, a friend of the young filmmaker says he is 
baffled by the news because he 'never knew him to do drugs'.

The friend, who was not identified by RadarOnline, told the website: 'I saw him two weeks ago and he seemed great. He was healthy and upbeat and didn't seem depressed at all.

Unresponsive: The filmmaker's body was taken straight to the coroner's office - and not to the hospital

'I never knew him to do drugs, not 
even weed, so for him to die from an overdose is kind of shocking to me.
I am totally stunned.'

Radar reports an autopsy will be performed as early as Sunday, however, toxicology tests will be needed to determine cause of death. 

The results of such tests could take weeks.

Sylvester Stallone on Friday said he is 'devastated' and 'grief-stricken' over the death of his son.

A source told Radar that medics
arrived on the scene at 3.05pm Friday afternoon and spent around 25 
minutes trying to revive Sage before his death was pronounced at the 
scene.

His body was taken straight to the coroner's office - and the insider claims no suicide note was found.

'I suspect he had been dead for quite a while when he was discovered,' 
the source told the website.

'Usually medics will be at the scene 
for around forty-five minutes but they were out of there within half an 
hour.

'There were a number of prescription bottles found at the scene but it did not appear to be suicide and no note was found.'

A 9-1-1 call  was placed shortly 
before 3pm and the caller said Sage wasn't breathing and indicated it 
could be a drug overdose, Radar reports. An autopsy is scheduled to take place in the next 48 hours.

Shortly after news of Sage's death, a
spokesman released a statement on behalf of his action hero father, 66,
who was at the Comic Con film convention in San Diego yesterday.

'Sylvester Stallone is devastated and
grief-stricken over the sudden loss of his son,' the actor's 
spokesperson Michelle Bega said in the statement.

'His compassion and thoughts are with Sage's mother, Sasha.'

'He was a very talented and wonderful young man. His loss will be felt forever.'

Police said they found the younger 
Stallone in the home while responding to a 'welfare check', however 
Sages' lawyer George Braunstein said he was found by a housekeeper.

Friends and acquaintances had become concerned because they hadn't heard from Sage in the past day.

Braunstein said the death came as a shock, telling the New York Post this afternoon: 'He was in good spirits, and working 
on all kinds of projects.

'He was planning on getting married. I am just devastated. 
He was an extremely wonderful, loving guy. This is a tragedy.'

Sage Moonblood Stallone was the 
oldest of Sylvester Stallone's children and co-starred with his father 
in two films. He was the first of two sons Stallone had with first wife 
Sasha Czack.

He made his acting debut in 1990's 
Rocky V - he played his Stallone's onscreen son - and also appeared with
his father in 1996's Daylight.

Also in 1996, Sage Stallone and 
veteran film editor Bob Murawski co-founded Grindhouse Releasing, a 
company dedicated to preserving and promoting the B-movies and 
exploitation films of the 1970s and 80s.

He also directed the 2006 short Vic, which screened at the Palm Springs Film Festival.

Braunstein said Sage had frequent requests to work on films.

'He was a full of life filmmaker with
his whole future ahead of him,' he said. 'He was just very up and 
enthusiastic and positive.

'I think it was probably some sort of accident,' he said of the death, and claimed he had never seen Sage take drugs.

He told E! News: 'I never knew him to drink alcohol. I never saw him take drugs. I never knew of anything like that.'

The lawyer has also made claims that Sage in fact posted photos to his Facebook account 17 hours before his body was discovered.

Braunstein added that Sage Stallone greatly admired his father but was working hard to make his own name in the film industry.

'He was very proud of his father and proud to be his father's son,' he said.

Stallone's split from Sage's mother Czack in 1985 after 11 years together. They also have a another son 
Seargeoh, 32, who is autistic. 

Big boots to fill: Sage said he always worried about living up to his father's success, seen here together again in Rocky V

He wed model and actress Brigitte 
Nielsen in the following December in Beverly Hills but they split just two 
years later in a very public divorce.

He married third wife, Jennifer 
Flavin, in 1997 after an eight-year on-again, off-again relationship and
they have three daughters: Sophia Rose, 15, Sistine Rose, 14, and 
Scarlet Rose, 10.

Sage, who
was raised by his mother following his parents' divorce, felt distant 
from his father growing up, a theme which hit home as they were filming 
Rocky V together.

‘When I was screaming, “You never spent time with me! You never spent time with my mother!” - that was true,’ he told People magazine in 1996. ‘I was looking into my father's face and really saying that.’

But it proved a turning point for the father and son, who went on to form a close bond and they acted again together in the 1996 film Daylight.

‘Between takes, Sly and Sage would roll around in the dirt like two puppies,’ the director Rob Cohen observed at the time.

Sage certainly felt the pressure of growing up with such a famous father and would worry that he would never match his success.

‘I tell him, “As long as you give it your best, that's all that matters,” his mother Sasha said in that same year.

Sage went on to pursue a career behind the camera and shunned the wild Hollywood party scene, preferring to watch horror zombie films instead.

‘People call me a hermit,’ he said while promoting the film. ‘But I'm happy.’
