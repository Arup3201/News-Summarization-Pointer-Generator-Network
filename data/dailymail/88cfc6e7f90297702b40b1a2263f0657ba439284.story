Elizabeth Starr fears her now illegal  boob job will kill her after her breasts ballooned to an O cup

An adult film star fears her banned breast implants will kill her after her breasts ballooned to an O cup.

Elizabeth Starr had now-illegal 'string' implants 15 years ago to boost her career - but says her life has been ruined by her super-sized chest.

Doctors have recommended she face a double mastectomy rather than live with her potentially fatal implants.

But the mother-of-two, who has endured a staggering 63 corrective procedures, says she can't face more surgery despite being at risk from blood clots and infection as it would mean the end of her career.

The  43-year-old glamour model whose breasts are still growing, said: 'I was basically the victim of an experiment and I've been paying the price for it ever since.

'Back then I had a family to support and I knew getting bigger boobs would boost my career prospects.

'Now I live day to day worrying I might be struck down by infections or blood clots - it's ruined my life.'

Ms Starr, from Los Angeles, California, was already a 32F when she opted for the polypropylene string implants in 1999.

The £3,000 procedure involved inserting synthetic string into the breasts to stimulate fluid production and growth.

But just a few days after the operation she began suffering complications.

Ms Starr, said: 'My right breast was bright red and swollen and I felt weak and shaky.

'The surgeon cut some tissue away from the breast which he thought might be infected.

'But the infection gradually ate a hole in my right breast the size of a 10-pence piece.

'The pain was unbearable.'

Elizabeth had the string implant removed from her right breast, however, the left one was already too embedded to be taken out.

She said: 'The way the implants work is they continue to grow inside you and become enmeshed in the breast tissue.

'Even now I have some residual string in my right breast - I don't think I'll ever be free of it all.

'I was lied to and told the operation had been approved by the medical authority, but it hadn't.'

Over the next 14 years Elizabeth spent a staggering £200,000 on reconstructive operations to put right damage from the surgery.

She said: 'Over the years I've had lots of implants put in and taken out to make my right breast the same size as my left.

'The tissue in my right breast was so badly damaged that there was almost nothing left.

'One operation involved taking a muscle from my back to replace damaged tissue in my right breast.

'I've spent time recovering in oxygen tents and almost died three times.'

Now Elizabeth has a saline implant containing four litres of liquid in her right breast, to match the breast fluid in her left.

But the risk of further complications casts a shadow over her future health.

She said: 'There is so much scar tissue in my breasts it's affecting the blood flow to the body and could cause a fatal blood clot.

'I'm a ticking time bomb because anything could happen to me - I'm so scared.'

Elizabeth already had 38F breast before opting for the string implants.

And the single mother to Jason, 23, and Nicholas, 20, hopes her story will act as a warning to women wanting to copy her look.

She said: 'If you are going to attempt to try to become as busty as I am you are putting yourself at extreme risk.

'You have to know what you are getting yourself into because it will change your life forever.

Before the operation: The remaining string implant is causing fluid to leak into both breasts making them to balloon

'I'm in constant pain - bending down and getting dressed are difficult because my back hurts from the weight of my breasts.'

She says the remaining string implant is causing fluid to leak into both breasts making them to balloon.

For the last eight years she has been cared for by Dr Alexander Sinclair, an expert in plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Dr Sinclair said: 'Over the years I've seen cases of polypropylene string implants but I've never seen a case quite like Elizabeth's - her future is uncertain.

'I presented her case at the local medical society and the sentiment was she needed a double mastectomy.'

However, the years of operations have decimated Elizabeth's breast tissue, and she is unwilling to face more risky surgery.

She said: 'I have one option other than to live like this and that is to face a mastectomy.

'But after 63 procedures on my right breast and fighting to keep my career and my breast, I honestly don't think that I could.

'A mastectomy would take away my livelihood and I don't know what else I would do.'

'It's hard when you have been a victim of something and it's even harder when you choose a path in life where people might look down on you and think, 'she deserved it'.

'But I wouldn't wish this on anyone and I hope my story will act as a warning.'
