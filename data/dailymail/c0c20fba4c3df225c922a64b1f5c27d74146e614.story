Parents who immunise their children may be cleared from the planned $7 GP co-payment as a compromise for the widely unpopular Budget.

The proposed option will mean children can still be vaccinated free of charge when seeing a bulk-billing doctor.

The decision was put forward after the Abbott government struggled to win the necessary support since the much maligned Budget was delivered by Treasurer Joe Hockey back in May.

The compromise deal is a bid to gain support from crossbenchers who said they would not back the measure.

It's was revealed by the Labor party that the government's planned $7 GP co-payment and a $5 increase to every PBS script for workers will cost each Australian $300 over the next four years, reported the Daily Telegraph.

Other options reportedly being examined include exemptions for the elderly and a fee reduction for pensioners.

No final decision has been made as debate on the co-payment announced in the federal budget will continue on Monday when Parliament resumes.
