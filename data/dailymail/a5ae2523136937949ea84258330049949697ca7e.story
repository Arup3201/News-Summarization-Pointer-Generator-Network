Celtic striker John Guidetti has backed the Hoops to grab their first Europa League win without him.

The on-loan Manchester City hitman has blasted three goals in his first four games for the Parkhead outfit.

But he will again sit out his new side's European clash with Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday night after his his move to Glasgow failed to beat last month's UEFA transfer deadline.

John Guidetti scored his first goal in Celtic colours during their victory against St Mirren at the weekend 

Ronny Deila's side kicked off their group-stage campaign with a 2-2 draw in Salzburg but will aim to collect three points when they host the Croatian champions at Celtic Park.

Guidetti - who opened his Bhoys account with a goal in last week's Scottish League Cup win over Hearts before grabbing a double against St Mirren on Saturday - told the Celtic View: 'The boys are going to do fantastic.

'I'm going to watch from the stands, which is even worse because you get more nervous.

'Of course it's frustrating. This was the game I would love to play in but this is life and I have 100 per cent belief in the boys that they're going to do well.

'Hopefully with the fantastic support that I've heard about on European nights we can win.

'Hopefully I can learn a few songs and sing along as well.'
