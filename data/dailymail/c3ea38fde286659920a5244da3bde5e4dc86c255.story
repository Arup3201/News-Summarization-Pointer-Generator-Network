Like many in the U.S., building a home on the range was a paper dream for Elis F. Stenman.

But unlike many, Stenman made his American Dream reality - by building a house entirely out of paper.

And the unique property in Rockport, Massachusetts, U.S., has stood the test of time - its paper walls, paper furniture and even paper grandfather clock are going strong after more than 90 years.

Cut-out cottage: The house in Rockport, Massachusetts, US, is built entirely out of paper

Fully functional: The house comes fitted with electricity and running water, despite its apparently flimsy building materials

While the framework of the house is wooden, the walls are made from layers and layers of newspaper, which are glued and varnished to strengthen them.

Stenman, a mechanical engineer who designed the machines that make paper clips, began building the house as a hobby.

He began his project in 1922 and completed it in 1924. The house opened as a museum in the 1930s.

Mr Stenman's great niece Edna Beaudoin now runs the Paper House, after taking it on from her mother.

Ms Beaudoin said: 'Rain blows in, sometimes snow, but it's held up pretty well considering how old it is.

'Elis was curious and wanted to see what would happen to the paper, and well, here it is, some 90 years later.Â 

Kitted out: The house has paper walls, paper furniture and even a paper piano

Building blocks: Little paper logs were cut with a craft knife and glued or nailed together

'There's lots of varnish on the Paper House walls. But we don't varnish the inside of the house because the more you put on, the darker it gets and we really just like to leave it so you can still read the papers.'

Mr Stenman lived in the Paper House during the summer months from 1924 to 1930.

After the wall material was made and he was already living inside the house, he made the furniture.

'The furniture is made out of little paper logs,' said Ms Beaudoin.

'The little rolls of paper are maybe a half inch thick and they're all cut to different sizes - cut with a knife.

Then they're glued or nailed together.'

Mr Stenman lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Well equipped: A paper piano and a grandfather clock which is made from a paper from each of the 48 states that made up the U.S. at the time

While making the Paper House, he mixed his own glue to put the paper together.

Ms Beaudoin said: 'It was basically flour and water, but he would add little sticky substances like apple peels.

'It has really lasted. The furniture is usable, and quite heavy.'

All of the furniture in the house is made from paper, including the grandfather clock and piano.

Inside
the clock is a paper from each one of the 48 states in it, so there are
all the state capitals and you can read them all the way down the front
of the clock.

As it was made in the 1930s, the only two papers missing are those for Alaska and Hawaii.

Home sweet home: Mechanical engineer Elis F. Stenman lived in his Paper House in the summer from 1924 to 1930

'This is a small town,' said Ms Beaudoin. 'Word got around that this man was making a house out of paper.

'I still feel responsible for it, but I don't worry about it.

'It's been here since 1924, so I guess if a storm was going to blow it over, then so be it.

'Here it sits and you can't spend your life worrying that something is going to happen to it. You just take care of it and that's it.

'When most people hear about the Paper House, they just ask, "why?"

'I don't really know the answer. I don't really know why unless he was just really thrifty or something.

'Newspapers were pretty inexpensive and everybody gave him the newspapers.'

Admission to the Paper House is $2.00 for adults and $1.00 for children aged between six and 14.
