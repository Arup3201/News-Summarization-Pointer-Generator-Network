The captain of the cruise ship Costa Concordia which sank off the Italian island of Gigilo in 2012 killing 32 people has been sentenced to 16 years in jail for manslaughter.

Francesco Schettino, dubbed 'Captain Coward' after he fled the ship before the 4,200 passengers were safely ashore, was handed the sentence this evening in Grosseto, Tuscany.

The 54-year-old was given ten years for manslaughter, five for causing a shipwreck, one for abandoning ship, and a further month for giving false information to port authorities.

His lawyers had launched a last-minute appeal yesterday attempting to blame the rest of the crew for the accident, but their attempts failed.

But despite the guilty verdict today, Schettino remains a free man and still has the right to two legal appeals which can take years to process, meaning he may never see the inside of a cell.

Francesco Schettino, the captain of the Costa Concordia cruise ship when it crashed off Gigilo Island in 2012 killing 32 people has been sentenced to 16 years in jail

 

Schettino was dubbed 'Captain Coward' after allegations that he deserted the ship before all 4,200 passengers got off safely, and watched them coming ashore 'without even getting his feet wet'

Judges were told that Schettino fled the ship and was discovered by shiver passengers waiting on shore 'without even getting his feet wet'. He tried to argue he fell into a lifeboat by accident

The verdict and sentencing brought an end to a trial that has been running since July 2013. 

Schettino was commanding the vessel, a floating hotel as long as three football pitches, when it came too close to shore and hit rocks off the Tuscan holiday island of Giglio.

He was charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship in one of the highest-profile shipping disasters in recent years. 

Earlier the court had heard that Schettino was a 'reckless idiot' who had been showing off to a waiter on board the ship, and a friend on Giglio island, when he steered the ship close to the shore on the night of January 13.

Witnesses said Schettino had escaped the stricken vessel before all passengers had left, and when the arrived shivering on shore, they saw him standing there 'without even getting his feet wet'.

Judges were also told that after the ship hit rocks, causing a tear in its hull which caused it to tip over on one side, the evacuation was delayed chaotic.

Some of the ship's lifeboats were not deployed, while few instructions were given by the crew, judges heard. 

The former captain's lawyers had argued that he delayed the evacuation because of the wind conditions, and did not use some of the lifeboats as they had not taken part in an inspection several months previous. 

Schettino, pictured yesterday as the guilty verdict is read out, was not at his sentencing today. His lawyers claimed he was suffering from a fever, despite him making an impassioned plea earlier in the day

They also tried to argue that the captain had fallen into a lifeboat, rather than fleeing, but video from the vessel seemed to show him waiting calmly in line before climbing on board. 

A panel of three judges found Schettino guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to 16 years and one month in jail.

After seven hours consideration judges emerged through red velvet curtains from backstage at the theatre Moderna.

Schettino was not in court for the verdict although earlier in the day he had made an impassioned appeal. His lawyers said he was at his apartment with a fever.

He was also ordered to pay court costs and was banned from public office for life. He was banned for five years from being at the command of a ship.

Each of the 110 civil plaintiffs, crammed into a theatre where the trial is being held to accommodate them, will receive 30,000 Euros (£23,000) each, while 300,000 Euros (£230,000) will go to the island of Giglio and the region of Tuscany.

Cesare Bulgheroni, a lawyer representing a Greek couple who survived and the estate of a German who died, said: 'Something is missing in this trial of Schettino. It is incomplete because, in our view, other responsibilities, beyond his, emerged.'

Mr Bulgheroni said an emergency diesel generator didn't work, elevators didn't shut down for safety reasons during the disaster, and some crew didn't speak Italian - the ship's working language - while others barely spoke English. 

Judges at the court in Grosseto read out Schettino's sentence this evening. However it is far from certain he will see jail, as he is entitled to two legal appeals which could take years to process

The Costa Concordia was travelling close to Gigilo Island when it hit rocks which ripped a whole in its side, causing the vessel to capsize and starting a panicked late-night evacuation

The lawyer joined others in a network called 'Justice for the Concordia', insisting cruise line firm Costa Crociere's board of directors should have been held equally responsible.

Mr Bulgheroni added: 'We didn't have those people in the dock. There was only Schettino. People didn't die because the ship hit the rocks, they perished because they weren't helped in the emergency.'

The company was fined 1 million euros in 2013 by a judge in Tuscany.

Hours before the verdict Schettino's lawyers made a last-ditch attempt to blame the disaster on his own crew - living up to his nickname of Captain Coward. 

Lawyer Donato Laino told the court in Grosseto that prosecutors had built their case 'around one person, not the facts', and Mr Schettino believed he was being made a scapegoat for wider failings.

Schettino's lawyers denied he acted like a 'reckless idiot' when the Concordia smashed into a reef when sailing too close to the Tuscan island of Giglio on July 27, 2014.

Investigators severely criticised his handling of the disaster, accusing him of bringing the 290 metre-long vessel too close to shore amid claims he was 'saluting' those on the shore.

Schettino's lawyers had attempted a last-minute legal appeal, attempting to blame the rest of the crew for the accident, but it was unsuccessful

The disaster triggered a chaotic night evacuation of more than 4,000 passengers and crew and left 32 people dead.

Survivors spoke of their shock of seeing the skipper standing on the shore after the disaster without even getting his feet wet.

Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 26 years in prison for Schettino, who admitted some responsibility as captain of the ship but denied blame for deaths that occurred during the evacuation. 

Passenger Joe Stribley, 23, a dancer from Maidstone, Kent, said he was ‘happy’ with the outcome.

‘When the ship started to sink, extreme panic set in and I thought I was going to die,’ he added. ‘People started to jump into the water and I did the same and managed to get to the shore.

‘When I got home, I was very withdrawn, in shock and disbelief.’

Another dancer Rosalyn Rincon, 33, from Blackpool, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. ‘It felt like a horrible nightmare,’ she said.

‘I was trying to help other passengers and suddenly realised there were no other lifeboats. It dawned on me I was not going to be rescued – I couldn’t stop shaking.

‘We were told by crew to jump into the water. I was terrified but I knew it was the only way.

‘When I got home, I lost all my confidence and struggled to come to terms with what had happened.’
