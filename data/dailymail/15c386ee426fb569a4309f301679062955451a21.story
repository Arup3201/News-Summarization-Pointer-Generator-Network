Auctioneers in London were left stunned when a buyer spent £500,000 on three garages - even though the lot came without planning permission.

For the same staggering amount, the owner could have bought a sprawling country retreat or even a fleet of luxury sports cars.

But the winning bid could prove to be a bargain if planning permission is granted for the site in Wandsworth, south-west London, where a semi-detached home can sell for £1.46 million.

Sought after: The garages, which have parking at the front and are built on the side of a semi-detached family home, could be worth more than £1million if it is developed into another semi-detached property

Bidding war: The three garages in south-west London, pictured, were listed at a guide price of £130,000 but sold for £500,000 - three times the average house price in England and Wales

The row of garages on Blenkarne Road near Wandsworth 
Common, were offered at a guide price of  £130,000 
when they were put up for sale on Tuesday.

But there was so much interest in the site that the 
first bid came in at £175,000 when the lot went under the hammer at 
Barnard Marcus Auction in London.

Investors in the saleroom and on the phone battled it out for the freehold garages, which have parking at the front and are built on the side of a semi-detached family home.

The winning bidder ended up paying £500,000 for the three garages - almost three times the average price paid for a home in England and Wales last month.

With the money spent on the sought-after garages, the owner could have bought Moreton House, a 28-bedroom Grade II listed manor house in Devon which went on the market at £500,000 earlier this month.

It also could have bought five luxury Porsche 911 Targas, which cost around £98,000 each.

In the catalogue issued for the sale, Barnard Marcus Auctions said the garages 'may be considered suitable for redevelopment or reuse'.

However, there is currently no planning permission, making the £370,000 premium all the more extraordinary.

Chris Glenn, divisional managing director for Barnard Marcus, said: 'This again demonstrates the benefits of auction disposal to our clients.'

If the unnamed buyer does manage to get planning permission, then their speculative punt could pay off. 

Rightmove says the average price of a 
home in Wandsworth is £640,000, with a terraced property costing 
£905,000. A semi in the area costs £1.46 million.

Henry Pryor, a property buying agent, today described the purchase as 'shrewd'.

He said: 'I am not surprised to hear the price. The conversion of garages into homes is very much in vogue at the moment.

'The Mayor's office have identified hundred of sites which could be used to solve the capital's housing crisis. I expect these garages will turn out to be a shrewd place for the buyer to park their money.'

The three garages in Wandsworth is the latest big-figure sale of a lock-up in the capital.

In May, an investor bought a row of six garages in Parsons Green in the south-West of the city which were offered with no planning permission for £700,000 - ten times the estimate price.

And in April, a former coach house in Camberwell, which was used to park the Mayor of Southwark's car, sold for £550,000.
