With £20,000 couture gowns, some intriguing headgear and a stellar front row, Paris Couture Fashion Week closed on a high yesterday with incredible showings from Zahair Murad, Valentino, Jean Paul Gaultier and Vionnet.

The fall-winter shows have seen spectators transported from apocalyptic opera houses to the circus and flung across the four corners of the globe and the final day was no different.

Chinese singer Li Yugang performed ahead of a stunning show from her compatriot, Lawrence Xu, while Lebanon's Zahair Murad proved that she understands glamour as well as fellow Lebanese couturier, Elie Saab, with an accomplished collection.

Most of the couture collections have been awash with flamboyant glamour and sequins galore, so Rad Hourani's collection proved to be the perfect palate cleanser. The Jordanian designer showed an entirely monochrome collection with minimal Scandinavian silhouettes at odds with the Middle East's usual colourful style.

Earlier in the day, Jean Paul Gaultier's feline-infused couture collection took Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini and 'The Pink Panther' as its inspiration. The references merged with theatrical panache to produce once of his best shows in seasons.

Masked men: Jordan-born designer Rad Hourani revealed that he likes masks almost as much as Martin Margiela during his monochrome show

With a delicious purr, Gaultier 
pounced back into top form with a feisty couture collection, proving 
that despite a couple of off seasons, he still has a lot of tricks up 
his embroidered sleeve.

This
fall-winter's muse was the female panther, which inspired a slew of 
fresh ideas, including plenty of new ways to wear leopard and how to 
dress in feathers to look like a cat.

Leopard
print featured cheekily on tights below one stylish all-black crepe 
dress, and there were several incredible couture coats.

At first glance 
they looked like fur but were made entirely of feathers, speckled like a
big cat pelt and with white feathers at the edges to resemble skin- and the models most certainly wore them with attitude.

Gaultier, ever the showman, ensured the wackiness infused the show's presentation as well.

forty-three looks walking to the infectious theme of The Pink Panther

Clowning around: Inspired by clown costumes, Gaultier showed flair with a new silhouette produced by dramatic 1980s-style ice-cream cone-shaped chaps.

Man of the moment: Fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier acknowledges applause following the Jean Paul Gaultier show, which was fresh and engaging

Forty-three
looks filed by to the infectious theme of The Pink Panther, showcased 
on models who clawed as they walked. Guests looked on from stalls 
divided into lionesses, panthers, lynx and leopards. Sometimes they 
applauded, sometimes they simply laughed.

But aside from all the fun, there was some serious couture at work here.

by clown costumes, Gaultier showed flair with a new silhouette produced
by dramatic 1980s-style ice-cream cone-shaped chaps.

It was fresh and engaging, and it seemed to say one of the big cats of Paris is back.

The cinema theme most certainly continued throughout Wednesday.

In Valentino's encyclopedic show, continents and eras were merged and had The Great Gatsby director Baz Luhrmann in delight, who sat on the coveted front row with his daughter and Anna Wintour.

'Haute couture, like cinema, is unreal. It's theatre - a romantic aspiration that's more beautiful, more extraordinary than reality,' said the burlesque Moulin Rouge director.

From the Orient: Oriental motifs and arabesque patterns fused with Scottish herringbone tweeds and Renaissance capes were thrown into the creative cauldron

Imaginative: Designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli, in the process, seemed to have pulled off their most eccentric and imaginative show to date

Classic: Valentino described haute couture as like cinema, theatre and a romantic aspiration that's more beautiful, more extraordinary than reality

As guests arrived at Valentino's show, they glanced inquisitively at the zebra heads and gold-rimmed fish eye mirrors mounted on the walls of the Hotel de Rothschild, transforming the 19th century mansion into a vintage-style cabinet of curiosities.

'Enchanting, encyclopedic couture,' the program notes promised revelers- and it definitely didn't disappoint.

When the first tight gown swept by with the image of orange rhinoceros on 3-D bed of myriad earth brown lacing, apparently inspired by a painting of Elizabeth I, it was clear the show would follow through on the promise.

Designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli, in the process, seemed to have pulled off their most eccentric and imaginative show to date.

Oriental motifs and arabesque patterns fused with Scottish herringbone tweeds and Renaissance capes were thrown into the creative cauldron. This appeared alongside embroideries of lion's heads, bees, beetles and dragonflies, often to luxurious effect.

Big return: Returning to the couture stage after a 13-year hiatus, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren used a raked Japanese garden as the vehicle for their shadowy, minimalist creations

Get low: The models dropped to the floor one by one and the designers molded the dresses with their hands into various abstract forms, which produced a striking visual landscape

That's not to say all the looks worked. Some were too austere, and on the more elaborate silhouettes the patterning at times came across as busy.

Returning to the couture stage after a 13-year hiatus, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren used a raked Japanese garden as the vehicle for their shadowy, minimalist creations.

In an unusual presentation, the Dutch design duo meditated back-to-back in the lotus position before the collection showcased the 20 black, architectural creations. (Twenty represented the amount of years they've been in the fashion industry.)

Sluggishly from the backstage darkness, the dresses appeared in stiff technical silk with Oriental, almost organic silhouettes. They cut some beautiful and contemplative shapes.

The models then dropped to the floor one by one and the designers molded the dresses with their hands into various abstract forms. It produced a striking visual landscape: An interlocking mound of black with model piled upon model in several heaps of black fabric. 

High fashion: On Vionnet's catwalk, dresses were elegant, long and slightly revealing but added to the whole romantic feel of Paris Couture Fashion Week
