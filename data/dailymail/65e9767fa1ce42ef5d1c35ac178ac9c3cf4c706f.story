Embroiled: Christopher Cully, founder of celebrity security firm Greymans Ltd

The Mail on Sunday has uncovered new evidence showing direct links between one of the firms on the Soca list – celebrity security firm Greymans Ltd – and the notorious blagger at the heart of the case, Daniel Summers.

Greymans, which had offices in London, Los Angeles and Dubai, and worked for at least two major Hollywood stars, first came to police attention when Soca arrested the four corrupt PIs in 2009.

We previously revealed that Greymans was hired by Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson to trap a cyber-stalker targeting a relative, and rock singer Courtney Love to trace her ‘mislaid’ bank accounts.

But we have also seen several 2007 emails showing that a Greymans executive passed illegal and unambiguous orders to Summers, 34, described as the ‘linchpin’ of the blaggers.

Greymans’ financial controller at the time,  Andy Driver, who died of alcoholic poisoning in 2011, even invited Summers to Greymans’ Christmas party in a London pub.

In several of the email exchanges, Driver is clearly asking Summers to illegally obtain bank statements or itemised telephone bills on third parties.

On June 1, 2007, Summers asks: ‘Andy, looks like your subject has an account with Lloyds. What would you like me to obtain?’

Driver replies: ‘Everything please. A months statement et al?’ Later he adds: ‘Can we make it 3 months please?’

The following month, Summers emailed bank statements and telephone bills to Driver’s Greymans email. He wrote: ‘Hi Andy, Please find attached last month’s financials and the last two months of calls (at last!!!) made from the subject’s landline.’

Driver replied: ‘Thanks Dan – you are a star.’

The messages are among several Greymans ‘orders’ this newspaper has seen, and featured in the criminal charges against Summers.

No one from the firm appears to have been interviewed or prosecuted.

Greymans was founded by ex-paratrooper Mike O’Neill, 56, and former Metropolitan Police Special Branch officer Christopher Cully, 54. It went into liquidation in 2011.

On his profile on social media 
website LinkedIn, Mr Cully states that from 2001 to 2010 as operations 
director he was ‘responsible for .  .  .  management of all operations 
undertaken by the company’.

His
 methods came under scrutiny more recently after he started his own firm
 called Dilitas and became embroiled in an espionage scandal involving 
one of Britain’s richest women.

He
 was accused of spying on a nanny employed by super-rich hedge-fund boss
 Elena Ambrosiadou during a rancorous legal battle with her estranged 
husband over their £200 million fortune.

Spying claim: The £16million-a-year hedge fund boss Elena Ambrosiadou and her £60m yacht Maltese Falcon

Ms Ambrosiadou claimed that Mr Cully was hired  by her husband, financial mathematician Dr Martin Coward, to gather personal information about the nanny which could then be used to persuade her to inform  against Ms Ambrosiadou.

Greek-born Ms Ambrosiadou was named in 2004 as the UK’s highest paid woman with a £16 million salary. With her husband she founded asset management firm Ikos, and owns several expensive homes and a 300ft yacht, Maltese Falcon, worth £60 million.

The couple, both aged 55, parted in 2008 amid allegations that Dr Coward had tried to set up a rival hedge fund in Monaco using mathematical formulae taken from Ikos.

The pair dropped lawsuits each was bringing separately against the investigators suspected of spying on them.

Mr Cully said last night: ‘The allegations against Dilitas and me are false. A week before the matter should have gone to court, she withdrew them and paid 60 per cent of the costs.’
