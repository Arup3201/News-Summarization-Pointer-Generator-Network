Mummified remains of a monk have been found encased in a Buddha statue dating back to the 11th or 12th Century. 

Erik Bruijn, an Buddhism expert, led the study that determined the mummy was of Buddhist master Liuquan, who belonged to the Chinese Meditation School.

The CT scan and endoscopy were carried out by Drents Museum at Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands.

Ancient: A study led by Erik Bruijn, a Buddism art and culture expert, looked into mummified remains of a monk that were found encased in a 1,000-year-old Buddha statue

Reserachers knew that there were remains dating back to the 11th or 12th Century in the statue, but it wasn't until the CT scan that they discovered all of the monk's organs had been removed

While it was known before the scan that a mummy was inside the statue, it wasn't until then that researchers discovered that the monk's organs had been removed from his body, according to Colossal.

Rolls of paper scraps covered in Chinese writing were discovered alongside the monk.

After the scan, the mummy was taken to Budapest, where it will be on display at the Hungarian Natural History Museum until May 2015.  

Many practicing Buddhists believe that mummies like that of Buddhist master Liuquan aren't actually dead, but are rather in an advanced state of meditation, according to International Business Times. 

Many practicing Buddists believe that mummies like that of Buddhist master Liuquan aren't actually dead, but instead, they believe these monks are in an advanced state of meditation. Another mummified monk like the one in the statue was found in Mongolia in January

In January, mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia.

The human relic is believed to be around 200 years old and was preserved in animal skin.

Initial speculation is that the mummy could be a teacher of Lama Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov.

Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov, born in 1852, was a Buryat Buddhist Lama of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, best known for the lifelike state of his body.

While researchers are still looking into their findings from the hollow statue, the mummy was taken to the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest where it will be on display until May 2015
