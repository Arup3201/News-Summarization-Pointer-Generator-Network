Walking dead: Graham Harrison from Exeter has been diagnosed with rare condition called Cotardís syndrome where he is convinced he is a zombie

A man diagnosed with a rare zombie condition today told of his nine years of hell thinking he was the living dead.

Graham Harrison, 57, was convinced he had died despite a botched suicide attempt - and even took to hanging around in graveyards.

He believed his brain had 'fried' after trying to electrocute himself and must be dead, even though he was still breathing.

Doctors diagnosed Cotard's Syndrome - 
otherwise known as walking corpse syndrome - one of the rarest diseases 
in the world, affecting just a few hundred people.

Delusional
 sufferers believe they are dead, or that parts of their body no longer 
exist, and often die from starvation because they feel they no longer 
have to eat.

Graham, a 
former water contractor from Exeter, Devon, woke up after a botched 
suicide attempt amazed he was able to talk - because he was convinced he
 had no brain.

He said: 'I just got annoyed. I didn't
 know how I could speak or do anything with no brain because as far as I
 was concerned I hadn't got one.

'My mind was blank. I couldn't hold any information in it. I took no pleasure from anything.

'I
 lost my sense of small and my sense of taste. There was no point in 
eating because I was dead. It was a waste of time speaking because I 
never had anything to say.'

The final nail in the coffin came when
 Graham felt compelled to go to his local cemetery because he felt it 
was the only place he could fit in.

Cases of Cotard’s Syndrome date back to 1788 but it was formally identified by French neurologist Jules Cotard in 1880.

Among the handful of cases over the years was a 53-year-old woman in New York who in 2008 claimed that she stank like rotting fish because she was dead. 

Like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, Cotard’s is another form of delusional psychosis, the only self-certifiable form of its kind.

Those with this condition often describe a loss of blood, organs and/or body parts.

This distorted reality is caused by a malfunction in an area of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which recognizes faces, and also in the amygdala, an almond-shaped set of neurons that processes your emotions.

The combination is a lack of recognition when viewing familiar faces (even the face of the sufferer), leaving the person feeling disconnected with reality.

There is no current cure for Cotard’s Syndrome.

Common treatments include anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, as well as the controversial electroconvulsive therapy.

He said: 'I just felt I might as well stay there. It was the closest I could get to death. The police would come and get me, though, and take me back home.'

Baffled doctors put Graham in touch with neurologist Adam Zeman, from the Exeter Medical School and Steven Laureys at the University of Leige, in Belgium.

Mr Laureys said: 'It's the first and only time my secretary has said to me, "It's really important for you to come and speak to this patient because he's telling me he's dead".

'He was a really unusual patient.'

Graham's recovery began after scans 
found that levels of activity in parts of his brain were so low they 
almost matched the brain of somebody in a vegetative state.

Mr
 Laureys added: 'I've been analysing scans for 15 years and I've never 
seen anyone who was on his feet, who was interacting with people, with 
such an abnormal scan result.

'Graham's brain function resembled that of someone during anaesthesia or sleep.'

Years
 of psychotherapy and drug treatment, combined with help from carers and
 his brother, mean Graham gradually recovered and he is no longer in the
 grip of the disorder.

'I don't feel brain dead any more,' he said.

'I can't say I am really back to normal, but I feel a lot better now.'
