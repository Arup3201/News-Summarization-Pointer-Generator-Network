It has received rave reviews, and online preorders sold out.

However, some early buyers of Google's Nexus 7 tablet, which went on sale this week, have found problems with the gadget's screen.

Online forums have been inundated with disgruntled owners complaining of problems  with their new £159 tablets.

The most common problems reported so far have been screens that are not glued on properly, causing the entire screen to come away from the bezel.

Hugo Barra, product management director of Android, launches Google's £159 Nexus 7 during Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O. However, early purchasers have reported problems with the gadget's screen.

One user, called Sadoway, who has the 'lifting screen' problem tried to fix it himself with disastrous results.

'When I pushed it down a second time, the screen stressed and cracked.

'Still waiting for them to replace it.'

He advised other users with the same problem to simply return the unit to Google.

'My advice is don't mess with the lifting, its a factory defect and needs to be returned,' he wrote.

Another user, lazaro17, said: 'Had a dead pixel on mine that I picked up from GameStop.

'Also it seems the screen is coming up on the left like if the adhesive is giving out already.'

Google has a 15-day return policy for the Nexus 7 and a number of other retailers have 30-day policies.

Other users are reporting concerns over the screen itself, with a number claiming their screen has 'dead' pixels which create black dots on the screen.
