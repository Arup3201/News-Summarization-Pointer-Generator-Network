The principal of a Delaware middle school and her 10-year-old daughter have been killed in a car accident.

Delaware State police and the Milford School District confirmed that 42-year-old Tricia Martin of Camden died at Christiana Hospital following the 10:40pm crash Friday near Frederica. Her daughter Taryn Martin was pronounced dead at 12:45am Sunday at A.I. Dupont Children's Hospital.

Martin was the beloved principal of Milford Central Academy, which has more than 1,000 students in 6th through 8th grades.

Unexplained: The mother and daughter were driving home around 10:20pm Friday night when their vehicle veered into the oncoming lane

According to the News Journal, Tricia Martin was driving a 2009 Acura MDX SUV westbound when her car crossed over into the eastbound lanes and veered off the road into a ditch, hitting a telephone box and fence.

'For unknown reasons the Acura crossed over the eastbound lanes and off the south side of the roadway where it drove along a ditch line, colliding with a telephone box and fence,' said police spokesperson Gary Fournier.

It then hit an embankment and flipped onto its side back onto the road in the eastbound lane.

Tricia Martin was in the car and her daughter got out to get help from a vehicle that had pulled over when another car hit both Taryn Martin and the Acura, pushing the car into the ditch and flipping it upright.

Beloved principal: Tricia Martin had worked for the school district for 12 years

Makeshift: A memorial sprang up Sunday at Tricia Martin's parking spot at the school after students and friends heard about the accident that claimed the lives of the mother and daughter

Dedicated: Tricia Martin was known as a fantastic principal who knew each of her students' names

Tricia Martin was ejected from the car onto the road and Taryn Martin was thrown onto the side of the road.

The driver of the second vehicle was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries.

Milford superintendent Phyllis Kohel says Martinâ€™s death is 'heartbreaking' for the school district.

According to Delaware Online, school faculty met Sunday to prepare for the first day of school without the principal.

'There are still a lot of heavy hearts in there,' Marvin Schelhouse, president of the Milford School Board, said. 'It's going to be very tough between now and the day of the funeral.'

'Heavy hearts': The school is in mourning and crisis workers are on hand to help students and staff deal with the sudden loss

Tricia Martin's husband, John Martin, was a Navy reservist who served for a year in Iraq.

A touching video of his return from duty to surprise an eight-year-old Taryn Martin at school was taken in 2012. A happy Tricia Martin can be seen in the background.

Mourners went to the school on Sunday and left flowers and cars at Tricia Martin's parking spot.

A crisis team will be at the school on Monday to help grieving students and staff cope with the loss.
