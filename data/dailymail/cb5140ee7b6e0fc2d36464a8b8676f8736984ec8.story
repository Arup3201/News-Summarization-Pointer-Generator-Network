Sally Ride, the first American woman to fly in space, died onMonday after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

The former astronaut, 61, was described as a national hero who changed the face of America's space program by NASA colleagues.

In 1983, she became the first American woman and the youngest American to fly in space at the age of 32 on the Space Shuttle Challenger. She returned to space for a second mission a year later.

Inspiration: Ms Ride used her high-profile position to champion scientific causes

She is survived by her partner of 27 years Tam O'Shaughnessy, her mother Joyce, sister Bear, niece Caitlin and nephew Whitney.

Although she had been friends with Ms O'Shaugnessy from the age of 12, it was not publicly known that the women were in a romantic relationship until her obituary was released today.

Her sister Bear Ride told Buzzfeed: 'We consider Tam a member of the family.'

She added: 'I hope it makes it easier for kids growing up gay that they know that another one of their heroes was like them.'

Sally Ride had married astronaut Steven Hawley in 1982 before divorcing five years later.

Dr O'Shaughnessy is the executive vice-president of Sally Ride Science. She helped found the program and the couple had written several science books together. 

Sally Ride joined NASA in 1978 after she was one of 8,000 applicants who responded to a newspaper ad. She was a mission specialist on the STS-7 and helped develop the shuttle's robotic arm.

After retiring from NASA in 1987, she worked at the Stanford University Center for International Security and Arms Control before becoming a physics professor at the University of California-San Diego. She was also director of the California Space Institute.

Motivation: Ms Ride set up a foundation to encourage children to become involved in science and engineering

Mission: Ms Ride helped developed the robotic arm on the Space Shuttle Challenger

Ms Ride used her high-profile 
position to champion scientific causes and in particular motivate girls 
and young women to enter the field.

Ms Ride set up Sally Ride Science to encourage children to pursue science and engineering careers.

Sally
Ride was born on May 26, 1951, in Encino, California. As a child, she 
was fascinated by science and always credited her parents who provided a
chemistry set and telescope to encourage their daughter's interest.

President Obama released a statement on Ms Ride's death: 'As the first American woman to travel into space, Sally was a national hero and a powerful role model. 

'She inspired generations of young girls to reach for the stars and later fought tirelessly to help them get there by advocating for a greater focus on science and math in our schools.

She will be missed, but her star will always shine brightly. 

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden

'Sally’s life showed us that there are no limits to what we can achieve and I have no doubt that her legacy will endure for years to come.'

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said: 'Sally Ride broke barriers with grace and professionalism – and literally changed the face of America’s space program.

'The nation has lost one of its finest leaders, teachers and explorers. She will be missed, but her star will always shine brightly.'

On the website for Sally Ride Science, it stated: 'Sally lived her life to the fullest, with boundless energy, curiosity, 
intelligence, passion, commitment, and love.

'Her integrity was absolute;
her spirit was immeasurable; her approach to life was fearless.'
