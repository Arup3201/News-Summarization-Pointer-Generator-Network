The Duke of Edinburgh plans to be by the Queen's side at a second river Thames pageant later this month despite ending up in hospital after the last water-themed event to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee.

Prince Philip fell ill with a bladder infection and was in hospital for five nights after standing in the cold rain for more than four hours during a parade of more than 1,000 boats along the River Thames in London.

It was Prince Philip - himself a brave young wartime naval officer - who particularly wanted a water-borne tribute to his wife of 64 years.

The thrones remain empty: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh remained resolutely standing throughout four hours of wind and rain during the river pageant

Doctors have suggested that braving the elements on the deck the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell, in cold and wet weather during the pageant might have caused his subsequent bladder infection if he did not make enough visits to the toilet.

But his illness seems to have done little to diminish the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet - a position lovingly bestowed upon him by the Queen to mark his 90th birthday - of his well-known fondness of all things maritime as he intends to be back on top form for the next water pageant in Berkshire.

The Duke - who quietly celebrated his 91st birthday with his family yesterday - will accompany the Queen on a visit to Henley-on-Thames on June 25 where they will travel on the 130-year-old steam launch Alaska to witness the annual ceremony of swan upping.

Good news: Prince Philip smiled and waved as he headed home to be with his family at Windsor for a private birthday celebration on Sunday

Walking tall: The Duke of Edinburgh looked in good spirits as he left hospital on Saturday

The Royal couple will travel from 
Hambleden Lock in Berkshire across the river to the Henley Business 
School in Berkshire where they will disembark to watch the rest of the 
river pageant from the shore.

It
is understood Prince Philip is determined to be well enough to attend 
the river festivities but it will depend upon his doctors giving him the
all clear to go.

It comes 
as Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Prince will miss a garden party 
at Sandringham in Norfolk tomorrow being held to thank residents of 
Norfolk and Suffolk for contributing to community life.

Heading home: The Duke of Edinburgh had not thought he would not be back at Windsor in time for his birthday after spending five nights at the hospital with a bladder infection

Royal visitors: Princes William and Harry smiling visited their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital

The
last time a garden party was held at Sandringham was in 2002 to 
celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee. The Duke of York will instead 
stand in for his father and accompany the Queen.

A
Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke of Edinburgh will be 
continuing his convalescent at home and therefore will not attend 
tomorrow's garden party at Sandringham or accompany the Queen on her 
East Midlands tour later this week.

'The Duke of York will now accompany the Queen at tomorrow's garden party.'

The
Duke was also due to join the Queen, along with the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridge, in Nottingham on Wednesday as she continues her Jubilee tour
of the UK with a two-day trip to the East Midlands.

Emotional time: The Queen looked much happier after visiting Prince Philip in hospital on Wednesday compared to how she had seemed to be in at St Paul's Cathedral on Tuesday

Unwell: Prince Philip waves during Sunday's pageant on the River Thames. He was taken ill the following day

Treatment: Prince Philip's bladder infection could have been exacerbated by not taking enough toilet breaks during the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant

Philip
was set to take part in the engagements on Thursday, including a visit 
to Hitchin Market Square and Hatfield House, but a Buckingham Palace 
spokesman confirmed he would no longer be attending.

Prince
Philip's admission to King Edward VII Hospital in London meant he was 
forced to miss some of the key Jubilee weekend festivities - including 
the final day of the four-day weekend of Diamond Jubilee celebrations 
where he was absent from the thanksgiving service at St Paul's and a 
luncheon at Westminster Palace.

He
was released from the King Edward VII Hospital in central London on 
Saturday and when asked if he was feeling better as he left the 
hospital, the Duke of Edinburgh replied: ‘I wouldn’t be coming out 
otherwise.’

The
illness forced the Duke to miss several key events of the Queen's 
Diamond Jubilee celebrations, including the service of thanksgiving at St 
Paul's Cathedral and the concert outside Buckingham Palace.

Edward said the Queen was ‘bearing up’ 
but added: ‘She’s missing him, obviously.’ Edward’s wife, Sophie, said 
the Duke was ‘naturally upset’ to miss the celebrations but added: ‘He’s
on good form. He is in good spirits.’

As the 
Queen left on Wednesday, she beamed with delight, seemingly hugely relieved at what she had seen.

Speaking yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron said that everyone was concerned about the health of the Duke after he was 
taken to hospital with the infection.
