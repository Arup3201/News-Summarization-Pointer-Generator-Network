A former schools administrator was sent to federal prison Monday for sending thousands of sexts to teen boys.

Mark Kandel, 53, of Scranton, PA., was sentenced to 14 ½ years behind bars as part of a plea deal agreed to earlier this year. Once freed, he will have to register as a sex offender.

In court, the depraved man’s daughter accused him of even going after her friends – this after he already served a 90-day house arrest in 2008 for providing alcohol to minors.

The former Scranton school director and board member was initially arrested last November after two teenage boys accused him of sending them lewd text messages, according to WNEP.

Investigators eventually charged Mr Kandel with five counts of online enticement of teenage boys, but said they could have proved in court he sexted at least 17 boys, WBRE reported.

Facing as much as 50 years in prison, Mr Kandel agreed to plead guilty to one count this past June. He admitted to contacting multiple minors via Facebook and text message, sending over 13,000 messages in total, reports said.

The disgraced former mentor called his actions ‘inexcusable’ Monday in court before learning he would be locked up until he is 70-years-old,  according to reports.

'I take full responsibility for my inappropriate behavior,' Mr Kandel said. 'I have fallen as low as a person can fall.'

‘It was a difficult day for everybody but I know Mark is glad it's over,’ defense attorney Frank Santomauro said outside the court after the sentencing.

‘This court knows Mark is not a monster,’ the lawyer added. ‘He's got a life, he's got a family. He just went down the wrong path.’

Mr Kandel’s daughter saw things differently, calling him the ‘epitome of selfishness’ prior to his sentencing. She said the sexual predator lived a double life and went after her friends.

'This man, who I'm now ashamed to call my father, went after my own friends,' she said, according to the Scranton Times-Tribune.

In 2008, Mr Kandel served a 90-day house arrest after admitting to providing minors with alcohol, said reports.

His daughter said he because a different man from that point forward, a ‘stranger to them’ that was glued to his phone every night.

Despite losing his family, job and reputation, Mr Kandel told the judge he wants to positively contribute to society when he leaves prison, reports said.

‘He's a bright guy and again, we just sometimes go a-stray,’ his lawyer said. ‘He's going to overcome it.’
