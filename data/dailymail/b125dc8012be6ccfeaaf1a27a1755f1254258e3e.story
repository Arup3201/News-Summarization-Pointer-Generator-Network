Harry Redknapp has admitted QPR are trying to sign Jermain Defoe but fears a deal could be beyond the club's financial reach.

Sportsmail revealed that Defoe has flown back to London to thrash out his future, with QPR leading contenders for his signature.

Toronto FC would prefer to permanently sell Defoe, while his wages amount to £60,000-per-week.

But Redknapp said: 'You never know (with a move for Defoe).

'It is a difficult one because of the whole package...

'We want a couple of loans in. We are looking for loans We are not looking to spend money in January. We bought some players in the summer and we have a good squad.'

Meanwhile, Redknapp insists QPR will not entertain any offers for hotshot Charlie Austin next month.

The striker has been a revelation for Rangers this season, but his contract situation has placed some uncertainty over his future.

He has 18 months left on his current deal, though the club are trying to tie him down to a new long term contract.

And Redknapp said: 'He has done great. He has 18 months left, he isn't going anywhere in January.

'We want to keep him here long term it's up to him and his people. He has proved himself in the Premier League and he wants to stay here. 'He isn't vulnerable at the moment, but maybe when you let it go into the final 12 months.

'But we want to tie him down.'
