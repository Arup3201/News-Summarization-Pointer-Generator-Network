Mario Balotelli was the worst player on the pitch in Liverpool's 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid, according to Spanish newspapers AS and Marca.

Despite Liverpool's defence being breached three times Balotelli came in for particularly heavy criticism for his performance and was awarded a score of just three out of 10 by Marca, and zero out of three by AS.

Considering Brendan Rodgers withdrew the forward at half time, it would appear his manager may have felt the same way.

Marca awarded Mario Balotelli a score of just three out of 10 for his performance against Real Madrid

In fact, AS felt that only two Liverpool players were worth ratings of higher than one. 

Marca were equally scathing of Rodgers' side, awarding Liverpool's defenders scores of no higher than four.

The hosts' best player on the night, Marca claimed, was 19-year-old Raheem Sterling.

Simon Mignolet: 5.5

Glen Johnson: 4.5

Martin Skrtel: 5

Dejan Lovren: 5.5

Alberto Moreno: 5.5

Jordan Henderson: 5.5

Steven Gerrard: 5

Joe Allen: 6

Raheem Sterling: 6.5

Mario Balotelli: 4.5

Philippe Coutinho: 6

Subs: Adam Lallana 6.6, Lazar Markovic 6, Emre Can 6

Brendan Rodgers: 6

The former QPR forward, who has been linked with a move to the Bernabeu, was given a score of six out of 10.

Rodgers was rated at four-and-a-half, making him exactly half as impressive as his opposite number, Carlo Ancelotti.

French forward Karim Benzema, who scored twice, was declared man of the match with a rating of nine.

The former Lyon man scored his side's second and third goals to put the tie out of Liverpool's reach.

Cristiano Ronaldo, who netted a sublime opener, and Isco were also rated highly by Marca. 

The result leaves Rodgers' side in third place in their Champions League group, facing a battle for qualification.

Liverpool, Basle and Ludogorets are all on three points, with three games remaining.
