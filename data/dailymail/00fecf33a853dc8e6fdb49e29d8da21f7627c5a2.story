More than 100 homes have been evacuated as bomb disposal experts carried out four controlled explosions yesterday morning.

Two men were arrested on terrorism charges following the discovery of suspected explosives in a garage during raids on two properties in Cheltenham, according to police.

Officers arrested a 52-year-old man from the Hester's Way area under the Explosive Substances Act.

Troubling news: Police searched two homes in Cheltenham after 15 neighbours spent the night at a hall and 13 were rehoused

They later found suspected explosives at a house in nearby Up Hatherley and arrested a 31-year-old local man, Gloucestershire Constabulary confirmed.

The controlled explosions took place at 11.30am on Saturday, after 15 residents spent the night in a nearby hall and 13 vulnerable people were rehoused.

A 200-metre cordon was placed around the garage as bomb disposal teams joined anti-terrorism officers, ambulance crews and firefighters combing the area.

Grandmother Sandie Williams, who lives nearby, told a local newspaper: 'This really is a quiet area and we have not really been told anything. We are just half a mile from [intelligence agency] GCHQ so you do worry and they have to investigate it properly.'

Resident Ian Boucker said he heard the sirens at around 9.30am. He said: 'I have been afraid and I hope they bring to justice anyone who may have put others' lives at risks.'

Mechanic Dave Cumberbatch, 21, who works nearby, added: 'Not a lot happens around here and people are all a bit shocked. It certainly sounds very serious.

Disturbance: A 200m cordon was placed around the garage where the suspected explosives were found

'I imagine the residents are very worried as it really does not happen around here and there are a lot of older people in the area.'

ITV correspondent Ken Goodwin tweeted : 'The bangs were like loud gunshots rather that a huge blast. The first was the loudest and interestingly it made my camera shake slightly.'

The force’s Assistant Chief Constable Richard Berry said he was grateful to local people for their support and patience during a 'thorough and methodical' investigation.

'At the moment we unfortunately are not able to say when we will be able to lift the cordon,' he added.

'It remains in place for the public’s safety and we have seen that it is justified by the results of the search thus far.

Drama: Residents and workers said they were shocked and frightened by the events of the past 24 hours

'We will endeavour to return the area to
normality as soon as practicable when we can ensure there is no risk of
harm to local residents.'

A rest centre has since been set up in St Margaret’s Hall for residents evacuated from their homes and care staff from NHS Gloucestershire are on duty to assist with medication and health concerns.

Chief Executive of Cheltenham Borough Council Andrew North, said: 'We understand how distressing this may be for a number of Cheltenham residents, but people should be reassured that we will get things back to normality as soon as possible.'

Earlier on Saturday, police confirmed they had re-arrested two men who had initially been detained on Friday evening.

Serious danger: Police thanked residents living near the garage for their patience as their homes remained evacuated

Concerns: Officers and emergency services combed the streets, where many older and vulnerable people live

A spokesman said: 'The two men arrested in Cheltenham yesterday, have both been further arrested on suspicion of the commission, instigation or preparation of a terrorist act (contrary to the Terrorism Act 2000).

'This relates to examination of the items found in a garage in Buttermere Close in the Up Hatherley area of Cheltenham.

'The South East Counter Terrorism Unit has assumed responsibility for the ongoing investigation but will continue to work closely with Gloucestershire Police.

'The 52-year-old man and 31-year-old-man are both from Cheltenham. They remain in police custody at this time.'
