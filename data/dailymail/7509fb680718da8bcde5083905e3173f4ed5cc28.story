These adorable 'miracle' quadruplets are all ready for their first Christmas.

Wearing festive headgear and each clutching a tiny candy cane, Alyssa, Carter, Miles and Bentley Sallaska nestle inside matching stockings ahead of their first every visit from Santa Claus.

The four children, who were born prematurely this September, were dressed up in the cute outfits in the hospital where they have lived since they were born at just 25 weeks.

Getting ready for Santa: New mom Amanda Sallaska poses with her three-month-old babies: Alyssa, Carter, Miles and Bentley

'Miracles': The children, who still live at the University of Colorado Hospital, were born prematurely at just 25 weeks. Alyssa, the heaviest, weighed just 1lb 9oz

Smiling over them in one of the images is their mother, Amanda, who held all four of them at once for the first time in the photograph.

Amanda and her husband Grant, from Liberal, Kansas, feared the babies might not pull through when she went into labor early - and had to be flown 300 miles by helicopter to the nearest hospital.

The tiny babies - whom Grant and Amanda refer to as 'true miracles' - still live in an intensive care unit at the University of Colorado Hospital, near Denver, but are said to be doing well.

Alyssa, the heaviest of the four babies, weighed just 1lb 9oz when she was born. Carter weighed 1lb 7oz, Bentley 1lb 6oz and Bentley just 1lb 5oz, according to Denver's 9News channel.

Together: The impromptu photoshoot was the first time Amanda had held all four children at the same time

Resting: The babies will have their first Christmas in the hospital with Amanda, their dad Grant and brother Landon. By new year they may be able to started heading home to Kansas

They also have a brother, five-year-old Landon, who travels to from home to the hospital with his dad every weekend to see his brothers and sisters, while Amanda stays in Colorado to be with them every day.

Though the babies won't be able to come home until at least the new year, the family still plan on spending Christmas together at the hospital.

Speaking to the HLN television channel, Grant said the family's Christmas plans are 'just to be together'.

He said: 'Christmas for us is about Jesus and family, and with all that has happened the last several months we just want to be together to celebrate the birth of our Savior and enjoy one other's company as a family.'

Parents: Grant and Amanda feared for the lives of their children when labor struck in the 24th week - but the births went well after Amanda was airlifted 300 miles to the specialist hospital near Denver, Colorado
