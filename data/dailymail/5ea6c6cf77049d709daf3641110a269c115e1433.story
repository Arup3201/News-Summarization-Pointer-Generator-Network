Sarah Palin announced she will not run for President in 2012 in a statement to her supporters late on Wednesday afternoon.

After months of speculation months and side-stepping questions. she finally announced that she will not run for the White House in a statement because her 'family comes first'.

In a letter sent to her supporters, she wrote: 'After much prayer and serious consideration, I have decided that I will not be seeking the 2012 GOP nomination for president of the United States.'

Hours later she appeared on Fox News and further explained her decision to be an effective outsider.

By for now! Sarah Palin announced she will NOT run for President, but she won't be far from the media eye as she promised to work an outsider to help causes and candidates she supports

'After prayerful consideration and a lot of discussion with the family, I concluded that I believe I can be an effective voice in a real decisive role in helping get true public servants elected to office,' she told Greta van Sustern.

Palin said she announced her 'no' in a statement because, unlike Chris Christie, she didn't want to have a big press conference about it as it's 'not about me'

'You don't need a title to make a difference in this country. I think that I'm proof of that.'

Palin also insisted it wasn't an easy or absolute decision.

'I would go back and forth about whether now is the time, and if I say no to the opportunity that's in front of me via running for office now, will -- political speaking, will I die? Will I be ineffective?'

She also managed to make a dig about New Jersey governor Chris Christie.

'I wanted to, you know, just kind of put the marker down and say, No, I'm not running, not have a big press conference about it, not make a big darn deal about it because this isn't about me. And it's not about Chris Christie.'

It has been suggested that she now will lend her weight to Texas governor and Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry.

The announcement comes after she was stung by suggestions in a new book that she once snorted cocaine off a 55 gallon oil drum while snowmobiling with friends and had illicit affairs with a top NBA star and one of her husband's business partners.

The revelations, which will inevitably now be seen to have struck a devastating blow to her political ambitions, suggest Mrs Palin took the class A drug with her husband, while smoking marijuana at college in secret liaisons with one of her professors.

Joe McGinniss's book The Rogue: 
Searching for the Real Sarah Palin also alleged that the former governor
of Alaska is far from the traditional family woman she claims to be.

Mrs
Palin, 47, had a one-night stand with Miami Heat basketball star Glen 
Rice less than a year before she eloped with her husband, the book 
claimed.

She was said to 
have met the 6ft 8ins player in 1987 when he was playing in a college 
basketball tournament in Alaska and she worked as a sports reporter for 
KTUU television.

It was also claimed that she had a 
six-month affair with Brad Hanson, who ran a snowmobile dealership with 
her husband Todd - a betrayal which led to Todd dissolving their 
business.

Heat: The book alleges that Palin had a one night stand with basketball star Glen Rice

Explosive: The book, written by Joe McGinness, right, may well be seen to have halted Palin's 2012 bid

In a bid to expose Mrs Palin's 
skeletons, Mr McGinness studied the former vice presidential candidate 
for three years and last year even moved in to a home next door in 
Wasilla, Alaska, to dig some more.

Recent polls had, however, suggested the outspoken politician was gaining ground on President Barack Obama.

After
trailing Mr Obama by more than 20 percentage points in polls all year, 
the McClatchy-Marist survey, taken on September 13 and 14, had the 
President leading Mrs Palin by only 49 points to 44.

A key reason is that she started to lead Mr Obama among independents - a sharp turnaround.

The
poll found that Obama looks increasingly vulnerable in next year's 
election, with a majority of voters believing he will lose to any 
Republican, a solid number saying they will definitely vote against him 
and most potential Republican challengers gaining on him.

Separation?: Todd Palin, seen here with his wife outside their house in Wasilla, Alaska, is said to be filing for a divorce

Governor Rick Perry of Texas continues to lead the field of announced candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, supported by 30 per cent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.

He is followed by former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts with 22 per cent and Representative Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota with 12 per cent.

Others trail in single digits.

A separate survey for Fox News - where Palin is a highly-paid commentator - found that an astonishing 66 per cent of Tea Party supporters - and 71 per cent of Republicans - would prefer, however, if she did not run for President.

Wasilla, Alaska

After much prayer and serious consideration, I have decided that I will not be seeking the 2012 GOP nomination for President of the United States. As always, my family comes first and obviously Todd and I put great consideration into family life before making this decision. When we serve, we devote ourselves to God, family and country. My decision maintains this order.

My decision is based upon a review of what common sense Conservatives and Independents have accomplished, especially over the last year. I believe that at this time I can be more effective in a decisive role to help elect other true public servants to office – from the nation’s governors to Congressional seats and the Presidency. We need to continue to actively and aggressively help those who will stop the “fundamental transformation” of our nation and instead seek the restoration of our greatness, our goodness and our constitutional republic based on the rule of law.

From the bottom of my heart I thank those who have supported me and defended my record throughout the years, and encouraged me to run for President. Know that by working together we can bring this country back – and as I’ve always said, one doesn’t need a title to help do it.

I will continue driving the discussion for freedom and free markets, including in the race for President where our candidates must embrace immediate action toward energy independence through domestic resource developments of conventional energy sources, along with renewables. We must reduce tax burdens and onerous regulations that kill American industry, and our candidates must always push to minimize government to strengthen the economy and allow the private sector to create jobs.

Those will be our priorities so Americans can be confident that a smaller, smarter government that is truly of the people, by the people, and for the people can better serve this most exceptional nation.

In the coming weeks I will help coordinate strategies to assist in replacing the President, re-taking the Senate, and maintaining the House.

Thank you again for all your support. Let’s unite to restore this country!

God bless America.

Sarah Palin
