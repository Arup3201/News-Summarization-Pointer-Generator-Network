When Roger Hargreaves’s six-year-old son Adam asked him what a tickle looked like, he went to his desk in the sitting room of their riverside home and drew a round orange character and named him Mr Tickle.

That was in 1971, and at that point the Mr Men were born. Within three years, a million copies of the books were sold.

Roger was able to give up his job in the advertising industry and write not only more Mr Men characters but also create the Little Miss series for his twin daughters Sophie and Amelia.

Today, one of his books sells every 27 seconds.

Colourful past: The extensive riverside property south-west of London has six bedrooms, a balcony and large conservatory

The house where the characters came to life was built in 1956 for Hargreaves and his wife Christine in the style of a Japanese minka, or simple country retreat, on the banks of the Thames at Lower Sunbury, 14 miles south-west of London.

Hargreaves, who died in 1988, sold the house – he named it Minka – in the mid-1970s and moved to Guernsey, but today it is back on the market.

‘Back in the 1950s, it became very popular among people who lived in London to build a holiday home on the river, particularly in this area and on the islands around Shepperton,’ says Owen Miles, manager of Curchods, which is selling the six-bedroom house for £3.6 million.

In 1956, Minka was a fairly modest chalet-style house, but it has been transformed into a light, bright, family home with five reception rooms, two kitchens and two guest apartments and makes best use of the fabulous south-facing back garden and its 190ft river frontage.

It is currently owned by airline executive Xavier Van der Doncht and his partner Nick Franklin, a surgeon, who ten years ago swapped their former home, a Queen Anne house less than a mile away, with Minka’s previous owner, Mike Noble, a record industry boss.

‘There was a narrow corridor and a guest toilet and ironing room at the front of the house, and no real views on to the front garden, so we opened it all up,’ says Xavier, 48. ‘In the dining room, we put folding glass doors, which we can open and make it feel as though we’re eating outside.

‘It’s a great house for entertaining. When Mike Noble owned it, he had parties for rock stars and Joan Armatrading spent a lot of time here.’

Noble added the splendid galleried library with its beautiful Art Deco staircase, which has a bannister in the style of a ship’s rail. There is plenty of space for guests, and the riverside annexe, with a bedsitting room, bathroom and kitchen, would make a wonderful study or artist’s studio. There is also a self-contained one-bedroom flat with its own terrace – and even that has river views.

Xavier and Nick, 47, have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on the house in the ten years they have owned it.

They spent £90,000 alone on the hand-made solid wood kitchen, which includes Circotherm, steam and combination microwave ovens, gas and induction hobs and an integrated coffee machine.

There is also a second, smaller kitchen, which is used by caterers when the couple throw parties.

The stunning conservatory, which stretches across the width of the sitting room and kitchen, cost a further £100,000.

The house is also remarkably private: A high wall and electronic gates hide the front gardens, in which Nick and Xavier keep a flock of rare hens, and at the back the peace is disturbed only by the occasional pleasure boat passing on the river.

‘It is incredibly quiet here, especially when you think we’re so close to Central London,’ says Xavier.

The couple used to have a boat, which they sailed to Windsor and Richmond and once took on a shopping trip to Kingston. ‘John Lewis has its own mooring so one Christmas, when the roads were very busy, we sailed over, did all our Christmas shopping and sailed home again,’ says Xavier.

Now the pair are looking for somewhere smaller nearby that they can once more leave their own stamp on.

At £3.6 million, the asking price is a far cry from the £2,000 an average house cost back in 1956. But the Mr Men empire has seen a similar stratospheric rise in value.

In 2004, Roger’s widow Christine sold the franchise for £28 million, and two years ago it changed hands again – ironically to a Japanese firm – for a sum believed to be more than twice as much.
