It sounds like a risky move for workers hoping to liven up a dull day in the office.

But millions of people are surreptitiously viewing porn on their computers while they are at work, an expert has claimed.

Around 60 million people log on to the world's largest free porn website every day - and two thirds of those are doing so from their desks, according to German sex therapist Dr Christoph Ahlers.

Berlin-based Dr Ahlers made the claim at a conference in Salzburg, Austria, on medicine and therapies for the treatment of sexual behavioural issues.

'Modern viewing of porn is no longer something in which strange individuals are engaged in in quiet rooms in video booths,' he said.

'Sixty million views, of which two thirds are people sitting at their computer at work, is a powerful indicator of what is happening.'

Dr Ahlers said watching porn was now a 'worldwide phenomenon'.

He added that a second rush to the X-rated website occurred after dark.

'The second peak is from viewers at home after midnight,' he said at the conference.
