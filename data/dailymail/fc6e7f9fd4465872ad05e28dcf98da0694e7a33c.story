Officials at the Colorado Rockies have been left with red faces after baseball jerseys printed up to supposedly honor the team’s legendary shortstop Troy Tulowitzki misspelled his surname.

The team handed out 15,000 of the incorrect shirts to fans attending a home game at Coors Field in Denver on Saturday.

The team’s star man may be tied for first for the highest batting average in Major League Baseball, but that didn’t stop his team printing up a shirt missing a ‘t’ so his surname read ‘Tulowizki’.

The Rockies quickly posted an apology on the team's Facebook page.

‘The Colorado Rockies offer our sincere apologies to the fans for the misspelling of the Troy Tulowitzki King Soopers jersey that was distributed tonight,’ read the message.

Despite realizing the error, the message explained that the Rockies had decided to go ahead and hand out the jerseys ‘acknowledging that many fans came to the game for the jersey’ and they didn’t want to disappoint them.

Fans were also told that there will have the chance to exchange the blooper jerseys in September and even receive a free ticket to a game.

Some of the jerseys with the misspelled name have already received bids of more than $80, while some sellers are asking as much as $300 for the rare shirt

However the incorrect shirts have become an almost instant quirky collector’s item.

Some fans posted pictures online of themselves or friends wearing the already-notorious shirts, while online auction website eBay is already awash with people trying to cash in.

Some of the jerseys with the misspelled name have already received bids of more than $80.

One listing described the item as ‘wrapped in plastic to preserve this wonderful mistake,’ with the added exhortation: ‘Own this piece of epic fail history!’

Other sellers are asking as much as $300 for the shirt. By comparison, Tulowitzki shirts - with the correct spelling - can be purchased on the site for as little as $11.99.

Tulowitzki, who is batting .340, leads 
the Rockies in home runs with 21 this season and is tied for 10th in the
 Major Leagues in that category.
