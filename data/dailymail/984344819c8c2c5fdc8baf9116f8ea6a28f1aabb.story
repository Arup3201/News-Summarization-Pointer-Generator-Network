Thousands of migrants working in the UK as cleaners, labourers or bar staff would have to pay tax for the first time, under Treasury proposals.

All those who work in the UK currently receive the first £10,000 of their income tax-free, which has meant the lowest earners pay no tax at all.

But under plans drawn up by George Osborne’s department, migrant workers who are not full-time residents in this country would be stripped of this ‘generous’ allowance and pay 20 per cent tax on all of their income.

No perks? New proposals would strip migrants of the perk that gives all workers their first £10,000 tax-free

The Treasury say that this brings the UK into line with other European countries such as Germany and Holland, and the US and Canada which also offer income tax perks only to residents.

The policy could save the Exchequer £400million a year, and is expected to put some migrants off coming to the UK.

There are up to 250,000 European migrants working temporarily in this country, and the rule would apply only to those who live here for less than six months a year.

But some 175,000 British expatriates who have an income from homes they rent out in the UK would also lose their tax-free allowance under the plans.

It would also affect some 100,000 high-earning international professionals who spend part of the year working in Britain – but they would be able to claim a tax credit in their home country.

The consultation says that there is a case for migrants on very low incomes to be allowed a tax-free sum, but that a threshold would be very difficult to implement and would create a ‘cliff edge’ beyond which tax would suddenly increase significantly.

Tax experts said the move would also create more administration for employers of temporary migrants as they are likely to have to place them on the payroll for the first time. 

The plans to deny the personal allowance to people who are non-resident for tax purposes were first revealed in the Chancellor’s Budget in March, but more details of the options were released yesterday. 

It follows a series of comments from David Cameron about the need to clamp down on benefits for migrants.

Under plans announced last month, migrants will not be entitled to claim Jobseeker’s Allowance until they have made six months of national insurance contributions – up from three months currently.

At present, an EU migrant in Britain temporarily working 40 hours a week at the minimum wage would earn £6,760 in six months, and keep it all under the personal tax allowance. 

Withdrawing the personal allowance, and imposing tax at 20 per cent would cut those earnings by £1,352.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The increases the government has made to the personal allowance support hardworking people by helping them to keep more of the money they earn and, as a result, is one of the most generous in the world.

‘At the same time, we believe that it is reasonable to consider whether non-residents who receive income from the UK are paying a fair share of tax on that income, in this country.

‘The Government is seeking views on whether it would be appropriate to restrict the personal allowance to those resident in the UK, or people who have most of their economic connections in the UK, as is the case in many other countries including most of the European Union.’
