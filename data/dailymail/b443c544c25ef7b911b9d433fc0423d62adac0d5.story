A woman who died because a tin can ripped out of her plastic Wal-Mart bag and broke her toe posted a tragic message on her Facebook page just one month before she died, saying she was looking forward to her second chance at life.

Lynette Freis, from Plattsmouth, Nebraska, went grocery shopping on April 16, 2010, at the local Wal-Mart Supercenter and 
the cashier gave her one plastic bag for two 42-ounce cans of La Choy 
and a two-pound bag of rice.

While she was walking to her car, the bag broke and its contents spilled out, with the tin of La Choy falling on her toe and breaking it.

It also caused a deep cut which led to an infection which spread through her body and despite antibiotics, months in hospital and 
two surgical procedures, she died on March 12, 2011.

Tragic death: Lynette Freis, from Plattsmouth, Nebraska, died from an infection she contracted after a Wal-Mart shopping bag broke and a tin fell out, breaking her toe and causing a deep cut

Blame: The lawsuit says Wal-Mart failed to properly train its employees on filling the bags or when double-bagging should be employed

On February 16, Lynette posted on her Facebook page: 'I am so excited, I am FINALLY being discharged from the Hospital after 67 days.

'Can't wait to begin my new life 
since I have been given a second chance at life with my husband, my 
daughters and their families!!!!'

Heavy: The cashier gave Lynette one plastic bag for two 42-ounce cans of La Choy and a two-pound bag of rice

Her husband William Freis is suing Wal-Mart, saying the failure of the overfilled plastic bag ultimately killed her.

The lawsuit says Wal-Mart failed to properly train its employees on filling the bags or when double-bagging should be employed.

The lawsuit also named the bag's manufacturer, Hilex Poly Company, of Hartsville, South Carolina, alleging that the bag was defective, and St Louis-based Bunzle Distribution, which provided the bag to Wal-Mart.

It seeks nearly $657,000 for medical and funeral expenses, plus an unspecified amount for her pain and suffering and the loss to her husband.

Representatives of Hilex and Bunzle didn't immediately return requests for comments.

Neither Wal-Mart nor the other defendants has yet filed an answer to the allegations, but Wal-Mart had sought to move the case to federal court.

Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove extended condolences to the Freis family and released a statement saying: 'Customer safety is a top priority, and we take it seriously any time an injury is reported in one of our stores'.

But Hargrove declined to comment directly on the allegations and said Wal-Mart will respond appropriately in court.
