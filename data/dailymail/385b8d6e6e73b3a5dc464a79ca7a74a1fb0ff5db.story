A YouTube star has been accused of sexual assault after pinching women's behinds in a viral video.

British prankster Sam Pepper, 25, has since insisted that all the girls were in on the joke and that it was simply to highlight how people have different reactions to assaults on men and women.

But the video, which has since been removed by YouTube, still has viewers in uproar, with some expressing skepticism over whether the girls knew, while others pointed out that he has created other insulting videos, including 'Easiest Way To Get A Number' and 'How to Pick Up Girls with a Lasso'.

Pepper, who has more than two million subscribers on YouTube, posted the video to his account on Friday showing him pinching women's bottoms after pretending to ask them for directions.

Cruel: YouTube star Sam Pepper shared a video showing him pinching women's behinds; here he illustrates how he hid his arm. The video caused uproar - but he has now claimed it was all part of a social experiment

'Trick': Pepper pretended to ask women on the street for directions before grabbing their bottoms

Shock: The girls in the video look surprised and look around them to see who is responsible for the grope

The women are all shocked, with some looking around them for the culprit, while one clearly says she doesn't like it.

'It’s completely inappropriate. It's against the law, and it just sends the wrong message,' women's advocate Britni Soto told KCAL after the video went viral.  

Fellow YouTube stars also lambasted Pepper for the video.

'Sexually harassing women is vile to begin with, but normalizing it by calling it a prank? So harmful,' Tyler Oakley tweeted. 

The video gained more than 1.3 million views before it was removed by YouTube for violating YouTube's 'Terms of Service'.

Pepper, who first gained fame in the UK after appearing on the country's reality TV show Big Brother in 2010, stayed largely quiet about the scandal until posting about it on Twitter on Monday.

'If you've seen something one way, will it change what you would of thought of it another way?' he wrote, before sharing a similar video showing a woman pinching men's behinds.

Prank: The women look shocked as he pinches them - but he later insisted the girls were all on the prank

Denial: He later posted a video showing women grabbing men's behinds, and on Tuesday he shared this video explaining it had been a social experiment to prove how people regard assaults on men different

This video, which has also been removed by YouTube, sparked some disgust too, but not the same amount as the earlier video, Pepper said.

On Tuesday morning, he shared one final video to YouTube explaining that the two videos had been part of a social experiment to show our flippant reactions to assaults on men.

He explained that he had been inspired by a male friend who was in an abusive marriage and whose accounts were doubted by police, as well as his own experiences being sexually assaulted by fans.

'At multiple events some of my viewers will grab my bum and giggle about it among their friends,' he said. 'I don't like it. And if the roles were reversed would people think it was OK to pinch a female celebrity?

'I wanted to do something that would highlight the difference between abuse towards a woman and abuse towards a man in a social experiment with you as unwitting participants at the heart of the experiment.'

He added: 'I don't want to turn off a light on a very real and scary issue women face I just want to shine a light on an otherwise dark corner - abuse on men.'

Explanation: On Twitter, he said he could have carried out his plan in a smoother way - but that he was glad that it had made people think about how differently they treat men and women

He added that the videos had all been 'staged and scripted' and thanked the women by name for helping him put them together. 

Some fans applauded Pepper for the series.

'To help out a friend who was afraid to admit he was being abused, @sampepper risked everything he's worked for. So much respect man,' one Twitter user said.

Yet others weren't quite so convinced.

'So were all the other videos where you pressure women to kiss you also 'social experiments' too?' one asked on Twitter.

Pepper added on Twitter on Tuesday: 'In hindsight we would all do things different in our lives, I could have executed this neater, but would have it as reached as many people?'
