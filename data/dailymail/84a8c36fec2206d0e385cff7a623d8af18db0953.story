The head of the FBI has admitted that the agency uses drones in the U.S. to spy on citizens.

FBI director Robert Mueller told congress the agency owns several drones but has not yet formed policies or guidelines on their use.

Confirmation that the U.S. is using the surveillance equipment to monitor its own citizens comes after the NSA phone tracking scandal rocked trust in the government.

Spy plane: FBI director Robert Mueller confirms the U.S. uses drones for surveillance of its own citizens

The confirmation of their use came in response to a question from Iowa senator Chuck Grassley before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

Mr Mueller added the drones were 'very seldom used and generally used in a particular incident where you need the capability.'

Although the FBI uses drones on domestic soil, it has yet to set down guidelines on the appropriate circumstances for their use.

'We are in the early stages of doing that, and I will tell you that our footprint is very small, we have very few, and have limited use. And we're exploring not only the use, but the necessary guidelines for that use,' he added.

'There are a number of issues related to drones that will need to be debated in the future,it’s still in its nascent stages, this debate.'

The use of drones over U.S. soil is well known, according to NBC Politics. They are used to help police working along the Mexico border.

The Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms also have the use of drone technology to help in cases.

When the Republican Senator Rand Paul challenged President Obama's use of drones in pursuing terrorist suspects in March, he won an affirmation that it would be illegal for the government to use a drone strike against a U.S. citizen on American soil.

He later clarified his views on drones, according to the Huffington Post: saying: 'If someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and $50 in cash, I don't care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him. But it's different if they want to come fly over your hot tub or your yard just because they want to do surveillance on everyone, and they want to watch your activities.'

The Federal Aviation Administration estimates there may be about 10,000 active commercial drones in five years, according to Bloomberg.

At least 18 states have introduced bills to regulate the use of the surveillance aircraft.

On Wednesday, Mr Mueller also used his appearance to defend the National Security Agency's collection of phone and internet records and resist calls for greater transparency.

'There is a price to be paid for that transparency. I certainly think it would be educating our adversaries as to what our capabilities are,' he said.

Mr Mueller, who is due to retire at the end of the year, said the FBI would
continue to weigh up the possibility of publishing more information about 
its surveillance projects, and warned that doing so would be to the advantage of 
America’s enemies.

Defense: Robert Mueller defended the NSA's collection of phone records and said Edward Snowden's actions had harmed the nation's security

'If we're going to prevent terrorist attacks, we have to be on their communications,' Mr Mueller said. 'Having the ability to identify a person in the United States, one telephone number with a telephone that the intelligence community is on in Yemen or Somalia or Pakistan ... may prevent that one attack, that Boston or that 9/11.'

He added: 'You never know which dot will be critical. You need as many as you can get. Let there be no mistake, there would be fewer dots to connect if you don't have a data base that retains those records.'

When the committee's chairman Patrick Leahy asked how critical phone records had been to the FBI's work, Mr Mueller said: 'For most occasions it has been a contributing factor ... but there are those cases where it has been instrumental.'

The FBI director also commented on the prosecution of Edward Snowden,over the NSA monitoring leak.

'These disclosures have caused significant harm to our nation and to our safety, and we are taking all necessary steps to hold accountable that person for these disclosures,' he said.
