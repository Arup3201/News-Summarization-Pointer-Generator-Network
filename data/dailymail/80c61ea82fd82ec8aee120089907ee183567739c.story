Footballer Ashley Cole is to be questioned by police after he allegedly got into a fight with a female TV presenter in a nightclub in LA. 

The former Chelsea star, 33, is on holiday with friends after he was left out of Roy Hodgson's England World Cup team. 

Cole, his best friend Shaun Wright-Phillips and about a dozen others had tickets for the Toxic Day Party in Hollywood nightclub Lure.

Other celebrities partying in the exclusive haunt included rapper Drake and R&B singer Brandy who were there to celebrate basketball star Nick Young's 29th birthday. 

However, hours into the night, partygoers claim there was a clash between MTV girl Donatella Panayiotou and Cole with one clubber describing the bust-up as being like a 'saloon bar brawl'.

One minute Cole and Donatella were drinking happily and the next Cole was pouring champagne over her head, according to the witness who was speaking to the Sunday Mirror. 

It is claimed Cole shouted: 'You know what that is for!' and that Donatella was pushed and shoved.

The millionaire's daughter, who starred in ITV's Young, Posh and Loaded, was also reportedly in a relationship with Manchester City player Scott Sinclair. 

Last year Sinclair, 25, split with his former girlfriend Helen Flanagan who plays Rosie in Coronation Street following the claims. 

Cole has been partying in Hollywood with his best friend Shaun Wright-Phillips who plays for QPR after not being selected for Roy Hodgson's England squad. 

He is now looking for a new club after leaving Chelsea and being dropped from England's World Cup squad.

It prompted Cole to take to Twitter to announce his international retirement, shortly after the news broke.

The ex-Arsenal player earned 107 caps for his country in a 13-year international career.

He famously married singer Cheryl Cole but the couple split after the footballer allegedly cheated on her during their marriage. 

The MailOnline has contacted Cole's agent and is awaiting a comment.

A spokesman from Chelsea FC has said it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage.
