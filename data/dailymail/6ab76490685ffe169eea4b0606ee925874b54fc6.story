Hundreds of thousands of offences may not have been documented because police fiddled the figures.

Constabularies in England and Wales yesterday reported that the number of crimes fell by 3 per cent last year.

But in the Kent force – where figures have been ‘cleaned up’ after a period of manipulation – recorded crime rose by 8 per cent.

Picture of Britain: Crime has dropped to the lowest level since 1981 but there are mounting concerns that police have been 'fiddling' figures for years

On the rise: One area where crimes appear to be rising is sexual offences, with experts saying the Jimmy Savile scandal and the 'Yewtree effect' has caused a surge in reports

If the same pattern was repeated across the country nearly 300,000 extra crimes would be reported.

In Kent, violent crime was up a fifth and sex offences and robbery by half.

Drug
 offences were up by 14 per cent, public order offences by 16 per cent 
and other ‘miscellaneous’ crimes by a third.

It is thought much of the 
increase is related to the more rigorous recording techniques. The 
figures suggest crime figures will rise in other areas with thorough 
checking.

Last week, the UK 
Statistics Authority stripped police crime figures of their stamp of 
approval. The watchdog told MPs there had been no proper audit for five 
years.

Accusation: Shadow Policing Minister Jack Dromey says the public are losing faith and confidence in crime stats

However ministers, 
who have trumpeted sharp falls in crime in recent years, pointed to 
falls in the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is based on 
interviews with 40,000 members of the public.

It
 shows crime falling by 10 per cent year on year to its lowest level 
since records began in 1981. The survey is traditionally seen as a more 
reliable barometer of crime levels over time.

It
 showed sharp falls in violence – by 13 per cent – and snatch thefts. 
Crimes against households fell 10 per cent and bike theft was down 15 
per cent, to its lowest level in a decade.

Norman
 Baker, Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister, said: ‘England and 
Wales are safer than they have been for decades with crime now at its 
lowest level since the survey began in 1981.

‘The
 Government has made clear that recorded crime statistics must be as 
robust as possible and we have a strong record on reinforcing their 
independence and accountability.’

Despite
 an overall fall in recorded crime, police figures showed a 4 per cent 
increase in shoplifting and a 7 per cent increase in pickpocketing and 
snatch thefts.

Reports of 
fraud – including card theft, online fraud and email scams – rocketed 34
 per cent, to 200,000. This is thought to be due in part to improved 
recording techniques.

Recent
 rises in sex offences continued. They were up by 17 per cent, including
 a sharp increase in sex attacks on under-13s.

These increases have been
 linked to the so-called ‘Savile effect’ as historic victims are 
encouraged to come forward.

James
 Patrick, a whistleblower and Metropolitan Police constable, told MPs 
last year that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had 
become ‘an engrained part of policing culture’.

Ministers have ordered a full review of figures across the country, to be carried out by the police watchdog.

In
 June last year, following an official review, Kent Chief Constable Ian 
Learmonth admitted there had been a ‘distortion of activity’ by officers
 trying to meet crime targets.

This
 week a senior analyst at the Office for National Statistics suggested 
some officers were recording offences only if they thought there was 
enough evidence to lay a charge.
