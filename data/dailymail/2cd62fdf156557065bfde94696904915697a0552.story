Former White House press secretary Jay Carney has joined CNN as a political commentator, the network said Wednesday.

He will start as part of the coverage of his former boss's prime-time speech Wednesday night, shortly after President Barack Obama makes a case for his long-awaited military strategy to combat the Islamic state of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).

Carney resigned in May after spending three and a half years as Obama's primary spokesman.

White House press secretary Jay Carney was a fixture in the briefing room for three and a half years before quitting in May

He was communications director for Vice President Joe Biden from 2009 to 2011 and worked at Time magazine for two decades before that.

Sam Feist, CNN's Washington bureau chief, told the Associated Press that Carney's experience in the administration and as a former journalist makes him invaluable for covering the last two years of Obama's presidency and upcoming campaigns.

Carney quickly earned a reputation as a tough but opaque flack for America's chief executive, peppering press briefings with evasive turns of phrase that left some journalists scratching their heads.

Under his leadership, the White House press office earned a reputation in Washington as the least transparent in recent memory.

Politico surveyed 61 members of the White House press corps shortly before Carney's departure and asked them if the Obama administration gave them better access to information than they had during the George W. Bush presidency.

Only 5 per cent said the Obama White House was more transparent.

Then-New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson said this year that the Obama White House is the 'most secretive' she had ever seen. 

More than 2 in 5 White House correspondents agreed.
