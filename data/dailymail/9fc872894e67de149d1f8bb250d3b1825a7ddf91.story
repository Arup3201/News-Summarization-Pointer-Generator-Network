It's flawless, rare and even pink - surely it's a girl's dream to own one. 

But to be able to show of this incredible piece of bling, you'll have to dig deep in your pockets. 

As this sparkler is regarded as one of the rarest and most desirable ever seen and could sell for as much as £10 million at auction.

The pear shaped 8.41 carat  will be sold by Sotheby's in Hong Kong. 

It was cut in New York from a 19.54 carat rough and its internally flawless clarity is extremely rare in a pink diamond.

Quek Chin Yeow, from the auction house said: 'Sotheby's has had the honour to bring to the auction market a number of truly remarkable coloured diamonds.'

'This colour is one of the most beautiful and concentrated shades of pink in diamonds that I have seen and, combined with the exceptional clarity, it is not surprising that it would command the highest per-carat pre-sale estimate for any pink diamond to date.

'With this exquisite pink diamond we continue Sotheby's tradition of bringing some of the rarest and most extraordinary objects to market.' 

The diamond, which will be sold on October 7 at Sotheby's Magnificent Jewels and Jadeite Sale, is expected to sell for between £7 and £10 million.
