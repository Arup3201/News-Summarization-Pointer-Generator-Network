A mother today told how thieves rammed her sports car from behind and stole it with her five-year-old boy still inside.

The woman, 24, got out of her silver Mitsubishi Lancer Evo when it was hit from behind by a silver BMW M3 containing two men.

As she argued about who was responsible for the collision one of the man jumped in her vehicle and drove off in Waterlooville, Hampshire, yesterday.

The second man drove off in the same direction in the BMW.

She later discovered the vehicle abandoned outside a school just a mile up the road with her son still sat in the back.

A passing motorist picked her up and helped her search for the stolen car.

The mother, from Waterlooville, who did not wish to be identified, said: 'When I approached the car I could see he was visibly shaken and he (my son) reached out for me. He was clearly upset.'

The mother and child had visited a 
local Asda supermarket and were on their way home when the BMW collided 
with the rear of their car.

She continued: 'As I imagine anyone 
would do, I got out of the car to speak to the other driver. It never 
crossed my mind that while I was doing this my car would be driven away.

'When this happened my first thought was for my son who was still in the vehicle. I panicked and tried to get help.

'It was an amazingly traumatic incident. Thankfully another driver stopped to help me and I'm so grateful for that.

'The relief of finding that the car had been abandoned with my son inside was indescribable.

'I really hope police can now find those responsible.'

The boy was not injured.

Witnesses say they saw two men leave 
the Mitsubishi outside the school and drive away in a BMW, hitting a 
white Mercedes van before fleeing.

Police are not treating the incident 
as an attempted kidnapping. Instead, they believe the 'organised 
criminals' were trying to steal the 54-reg car which costs Â£35,000 new.

No items were reported stolen from the Mitsubishi.

One witness gave the partial registration number of the BMW as HY57. The car is believed to have damage to its front.

Senior investigating officer 
Detective Inspector Christopher Parry said: 'The evidence we have so far
strongly indicates these men had no deliberate intention of abducting a
child.

'This crime is being treated as an isolated case.

'Our investigation is focused on the motive of stealing a valuable performance car, not abducting a child.'

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman added: 'Thankfully, the boy was not harmed or injured.

'His 24-year-old mother was not assaulted or injured either but is extremely upset and shaken by what happened.

'Officers are in contact with the woman, her child and family to provide care and support.

'We wish to thank members of the public and witnesses who offered help to the woman immediately after her car was stolen.

'Police believe this was the targeted
theft of a high-powered car by an organised pair of criminals who did 
not realise there was a child sat in the back of the vehicle.

'Officers are pursuing several lines 
of enquiry to track and identify the suspects and their car, which was 
described as a high-performance silver BMW M3 with four exhausts and two
doors.'

The Mitsubishi was recovered by 
police and is being examined for possible forensic evidence by 
specialist scenes-of-crime officers.

Both suspects were described as white, aged in their early 20s, around 5ft 6in tall with short dark hair.

The first suspect was wearing a light
coloured top and dark trousers and the second was of medium build 
wearing a dark hooded top and dark bottoms.
