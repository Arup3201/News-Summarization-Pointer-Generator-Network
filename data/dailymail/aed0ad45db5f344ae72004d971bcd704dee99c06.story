No changes: Aaqil Ahmed, the BBC's head of religion, has revealed atheists will not be invited onto Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme, despite calls by secular groups

Atheists will not be invited to speak on the BBC's religious programme, Thought for the Day, despite repeated calls by secular groups.

The corporation's head of religion, Aaqil Ahmed, said he had reviewed Radio Four’s 'God slot’ in response to complaints that it was 'too religious'.

But he also concluded the sermon featured on the Today programme was intended to provide a religious perspective on the news and should not include people of no faith.

'We should always analyse whether we should continue with something and in the last year or two we've had had some very detailed thoughts about this and we've decided to continue as was," revealed Mr Ahmed in an interview with The Telegraph.

The decision is likely to upset campaigners, including the National Secular Society (NSS), which has for many years called on the BBC to change the Thought for the Day format.

The programme features a religious leader speaking each morning from Monday to Saturday.

The group argues that the slot contradicts the BBC's ethos of 'fairness, balance and a voice for everyone in the country.'

On its website, the NSS stated: 'Only on this programme are such 
controversial views allowed to pass unchallenged.

'We
argue that this contradicts everything that the BBC is supposed to 
stand for: fairness, balance, a voice for everyone in the country and 
for a wide range of views to be made available to all.'

Mr Ahmed revealed his decision ahead of BBC Re:Think 2012, an inaugural two-day conference on religion and ethics in Britain, which will be hosted by the corporation in Salford this week.

At the conference, the BBC will unveil new figures showing that the number of people in Britain who affiliate with a religion has dropped from 68 per cent in 1983 to 53 per cent last year.

The survey also revealed a divide between the generations, with 77 per cent of people over 66 describing themselves as religious, compared to just 35 per cent among 18 to 25-year-olds.

This week's event will feature the Chief Rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks, in conversation with 
atheist Professor Richard Dawkins, as well as appearances from Jeremy Bowen, the BBC's Middle East editor, Ruth Pitt, head of Factual Tiger Aspect, and Lina Prestwood, commissioning editor 
for Channel 4.

Speaking about the conference, Mr Ahmed, who became the corporation's first Muslim appointed as head of religious programming in 2009, said: 'BBC Re-Think 2012 is the place where those at the 
heart of faith, politics and philosophy can meet, and discuss the role 
of faith and ethics in modern society and the challenges facing us in 
the 21st Century.

'It's an exiting development and something that fills a
gaping hole in the understanding of religion in the world today.'

On Wednesday, Mr Ahmed will take part in a debate with television executives called, 'Rethinking the God slot'.

Sticking to tradition: The BBC has pledged to retain long-running religious programmes, such as Songs of Praise

He is expected to explain the BBC wants to appeal to a broad audience with its output of religious programmes - including atheists.

And while he will retain traditional programmes, such as Songs of Praise, he will also commission shows dealing with people of all different beliefs and faiths.

Dead Good Job, which begins this week, is a documentary showing the work of undertakers across different communities and people of no faith.
