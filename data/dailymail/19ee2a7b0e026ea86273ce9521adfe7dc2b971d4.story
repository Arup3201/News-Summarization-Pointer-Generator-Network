Glamorous French film star Julie Gayet has launched legal action over claims she is having an affair with President Francois Hollande.

The blonde 40-year-old actress had filed a complaint for invasion of her privacy after the rumours surfaced on numerous French websites, her lawyer said.

One website claimed Mr Hollande, 58, had confessed that Ms Gayet was his mistress during a dinner with friends at the Elysee Palace.

Gayet has filed a complaint against person unknown, after a rumour spread on the internet claimed she was French President Francois Hollande's mistress

The couple were said to have begun the affair after she appeared alongside him during his presidential election campaign last May, it was reported.

In one campaign video, she described Hollande as 'marvellous', 'humble' and 'a really good listener'.

The French media reported that a friend at one of Mr Hollande's dinner parties told one blogger: 'Julie and Francois met during his election campaign, but sadly they can't see much of each other as Valerie Trierweiler is very jealous.'

Ms Gayet - a married mother-of-two who has starred in more than 50 French films - launched her legal action on March 18, her lawyer Vincent Toledano told France's AFP news agency today.

He said: 'The actress Julie Gayet has instructed my chambers to take legal action over the rumour, widely disseminated on the Internet, suggesting, with no foundation, that she has a romantic relationship with the president of the republic.

'She expects her right to a private family life to be respected as there is nothing to justify these claims.'

Mr Hollande began his relationship with girlfriend Ms Trierweiler five years ago after separating from the mother of his four children Segolene Royal.

The French First Lady, 47, is also fighting her own legal action over a book claiming she cheated on her former husband with two lovers at once.

The biography called The Troublemaker claims she was the shared mistress of Mr Hollande and former conservative minster Patrick Devidjian, now 68, while she was still married to Denis Trierweiler nine years ago.

Both men knew they were 'sharing' Ms Trierweiler, but when Mr Devidjian refused her demands to leave his wife, she chose her affair with Mr Hollande over him, before finally divorcing her husband in 2010, the book says.

Ms Trierweiler is demanding Â£35,000 in damages for invasion of privacy from the authors Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet, both TV journalists.
