Sea levels along the north-east coast of America rose almost four inches (10.16 cm) in just two years, a report has revealed.

The record increase north of New York City between 2009 and 2010 is being described by experts as an ‘unprecedented’ one in 850-year event.

And in Portland, Maine, sea levels rose by five inches (12.7 cm) over the same two year period, researchers found.

The report, published in the journal Nature Communications, warned that coastal areas would need to prepare for ‘extreme’ sea-level events.

Experts at the University of Arizona and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studied data from tidal records along the east coast of both the US and Canada.

Professor Jianjun Yin of the University of Arizona told the BBC: ‘The extreme sea level rise event during 2009-10 along the northeast coast of North America is unprecedented during the past century.

‘When coastal storms occur, extreme sea levels can lead to elevated storm surge.

‘In addition to long-term and gradual sea level rise, coastal communities will need to prepare for short and extreme sea level rise events.’

The researcher told the Washington Post that the sea level had dropped following the spike but that it was still 'much higher' than when the spike started in 2009. He added that global warming 'definitely contributed to this event.' 

The website points to the unusually high tides that were widely reported in 2009 and 2010 from North Carolina’s Cape Hatteras to Canada.

The study’s authors wrote that in terms of beach erosion, the 2009-2010 sea rise was ‘almost as significant as some of the hurricane events’. The quickest jump in sea levels took place between April 2009 and March 2010, it says.

One of the researchers, Paul Goddard, added: 'The sea level rise of 2009-2010 sticks out like a sore thumb for the Northeast.'

Researchers believe it was caused by a 30 per cent slowdown in a key ocean current system called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), as well as changes in atmospheric pressure at sea level, the Huffington Post reported. 

The study used information gathered from a series of tide gauges along the east coast with the four inch rise taken from the average of 14 gauges between Canada and New York.

The Arctic could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming, one of the world's leading climate change experts has warned.

This would cause sea levels to rise to nearly unmanageable levels.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Professor Oleg Anisimov said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet.

This means that there will only be open water in the polar region by the 2050s, with nothing more than a few floating icebergs at the North Pole, according to the Russian academic.

Professor Anisimov, from the State Hydrological Institute in St Petersburg, gave his stark warning during a lecture in the Sakha Republic - the coldest part of Russia.

He forecasts that the region will see temperature rises of up to 7°C within a century.

‘For several reasons, the Arctic climate change is more intense and faster than in other regions. There is a reduction in snow and ice cover, which has a protective function,’ he said.

‘On average over the last year, the minimum area of sea ice has decreased from 5.4 to 5.3 million square kilometres [two million square miles]. Over the past 10 years, the reduction of sea ice in the Arctic was by 13.7 per cent.

As well as rising sea waters, such climate change could threaten delicate ecosystems and marine life.

According to environmentalists, as the snow and ice melts, the ability of the Arctic region to reflect heat back into space is reduced and the rate of global warming is accelerated once more.

This could spark increasing numbers of forest fires and unpredictable storms and, at worst, bring a halt to the Gulf Stream which warms Europe. 

Sea levels rose four inches from New York to Newfoundland (red dots) in 2009 and 2010. Gauges from New York south to Cape Hatteras (pink dots) showed a smaller spike for the same time period. No sea level spike was recorded on the gauges (white dots) south of Cape Hatteras

Data gathered further south found that the rise in sea-levels were more in keeping with average figures. 

The University of Reading's Dr Dan Hodson, told the BBC that the data showed the importance of analysing links between ocean currents and surges in sea levels.

He said: 'Sea level change is a complex phenomenon, especially on the regional scale, where changes to the global ocean circulation can play a major role.

'The east coast of North America is quite close to an area of active, fast ocean currents, and so is quite sensitive to changing ocean circulation.'

The findings come a month after researchers at Harvard University found that the world's sea levels had risen faster than expected in the last 20 years as a result of global warming and other factors.
