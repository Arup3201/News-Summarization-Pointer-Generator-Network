Controversy: Argentinean President Cristina Kirchner also wants her nation's Olympic team to wear badges declaring the Falklands are Argentine

Argentina has been accused of a ‘disgraceful’ campaign of intimidation against fishing boats which have UK licences to operate off the Falkland Islands.

The government in Buenos Aires has stepped up its official policy of blockading the British territory by ordering the Argentine navy to board ships that it claims are fishing there illegally.

Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner last year issued a decree requiring all vessels passing through its territorial waters to and from the Falklands to secure consent from Buenos Aires.

In the latest breach of international law, Spanish vessels bound for the islands were intercepted and boarded by troops.

The move will inflame tensions over the sovereignty of the Falklands, which are still claimed by the Argentinians despite their crushing defeat in the 1982 war.

Diplomats in London were keen to play down the escalation as ‘sabre-rattling’ by President Kirchner.

However, Argentina has secured a 
resolution from 32 South American states at a Latin American conference 
endorsing its claim to the islands, which were ceded to Britain in 1833.

The intimidation has prompted a 
furious response from campaign groups and politicians helping to fight 
for the rights of the Falkland Islands population.

Admiral Sir John ‘Sandy’ Woodward, 
who led the task force to liberate the Falklands 29 years ago, said: 
‘Argentina is trying to colonise the Falklands.

'The population of the islands want to remain British but they are deaf to that in Buenos Aires. It is disgraceful.’

Bloodshed: More than 900 lives were lost when Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982

In the latest interception, Argentine
 naval commanders told the Spanish vessels they were in violation of a 
blockade of sea channels to the Falklands.

The trawlermen confirmed they had 
faced increased pressure in the past three months, with 12 boats stopped
 and threatened with fines.

Buenos Aires’s ambassador to Spain 
said the seas around the Falklands were ‘an integral part of the 
Argentine territory’ and in a letter to Spanish fishing groups he said 
his country was ‘duty bound to put an end to all those illegal fishing 
activities’.

The Falklands government issues licences to vessels wanting to fish inside the 200-mile maritime zone around the islands.

Mike Summers, a member of the 
Falkland Islands Assembly, said: ‘The Falkland Islands government has no
 doubt about its right to issue licenses to foreign companies to fish in
 its waters.

Boarding ships is a serious escalation by the Argentine government and it is completely contrary to international law.’

George Grant of the Henry Jackson 
Society – a think-tank – said: ‘Argentina is behaving childishly by 
trying to provoke a row. It is morally and legally indefensible.’

General Sir Peter de la Billiere, 
vice president of the Falkland Islands Association, said: ‘Argentina is 
trying to stir things up again. But we did not lay down 255 lives just 
to walk out a few years later.’

Argentina’s junta invaded the islands, known in Spanish as Las Malvinas, in 1982. 

Margaret Thatcher sent a task force 
including aircraft carriers equipped with Harrier jump jets and an 
invasion force to retake the islands.

Protests: Just last year the Argentine members of political and social organizations burnt a British flag protesting against the British ruling of the Falkland Islands

A 74-day war claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 Britons.

The seeds of the latest row were planted in January last year when British oil rigs arrived off the Falklands.

President Kirchner threatened a 
blockade and in July foreign minister Hector Timerman accused David 
Cameron of acting like a ‘bully-boy thug’.

The Prime Minister has insisted that the territory would remain British as long as the 3,000 residents wished.

Britain has around 1,200 service 
personnel on the islands, the Royal Navy has three warships in area and 
four RAF Typhoon fighter-bombers have been deployed.

The Foreign Office said: ‘Although we
 are aware that Argentina has challenged vessels transiting between the 
Falklands and the port of Montevideo we are not aware of any vessel that
 has been fined or individual arrested. The UK has protested to 
Argentina.’
