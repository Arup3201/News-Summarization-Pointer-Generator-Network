A Northern Territory government department's social club was forced to cancel a NAIDOC week lunch after plans to serve endangered sea turtle and dugong caused outrage.

The endangered species were listed on a menu set to be served to staff from the Department of Corporate and Information Services at Marlow Lagoon, south west of Darwin, today.

The lunch, to be attended with a gold coin donation, was cancelled on Wednesday after protesters threatened to storm the event and Queensland federal MP Warren Entsch labeled the menu 'appalling'.

Dugong, an endangered species, was listed on a menu set to be served to staff from the Department of Corporate and Information Services at Marlow Lagoon, south west of Darwin, on Thursday

An email invite to the lunch said the menu consisted of traditional home-cooked dishes including 'kangaroo satays, chilli crab, barramundi, curry goose, coconut curry chicken, dugong, turtle, chicken vermicelli and blutchung pork'.  

But Mr Entsch said dugong and turtle should only be consumed in the name of traditional cultural practices, and only at the site it was taken.

'It should not be vacuum-packed and sent around the country so that people can have a taste, and it certainly should not be exchanged for a gold coin donation; these are vulnerable species, not commercial species,' Mr Entsch said.

He said it was 'appalling' the event was being organised by a government department, and traditional land owners would be 'highly offended'.

The department's CEO Kathleen Robinson said the items were removed from the menu, and the lunch was postponed late on Wednesday as staff were uncomfortable with the attention the event had drawn.

'The DCIS NAIDOC lunch was organised by a volunteer committee of Indigenous staff members to showcase their culture to other staff with a lunch menu of traditional bush tucker,' she said in a statement.

An email invite was sent out to staff to the lunch (pictured here) and the department's CEO Kathleen Robinson later apologised

'Unfortunately, the menu had included foods that were not suitable for the event and these items were subsequently removed.'

The DCIS apologised for any offence caused.

'The volunteer group worked hard to prepare for this event and their efforts and good intentions are appreciated,' Ms Robinson said.

Section 211 of the Native Title Act permits indigenous people to hunt protected species such as dugongs and turtles for 'personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs'.

Mr Entsch said dugong and turtle should only be consumed in the name of traditional cultural practices, and only at the site it was taken
