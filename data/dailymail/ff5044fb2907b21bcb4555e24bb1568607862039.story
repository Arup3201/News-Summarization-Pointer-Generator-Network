The winner of Australia's Ugliest Living Room has been crowned, but luckily for the owners their prize came in the form of a complete makeover for the unattractive space.

What used to be a crowded, outdated and completely mismatched room in the house has been transformed into a bright and modern area perfect for entertaining or relaxing.

Nabila Jouni’s living space in their Guilford, NSW, home is completely unrecognisable thanks to a $10,000 overhaul by online homewares retailer TheHome.com.au.

Before: Nabila Jouni's living room was cluttered, outdated and in desperate need of a makeover

After: The space is brighter, more modern and appears much more spacious

Originally it was her son Sam who entered Nabila's house in the running, revealing his mother was too embarrassed to entertain even her own family in the living room.

'My parents have struggled to pay off their mortgage for the past 16 years, leaving no money to fix up our home. 

'All my mother wants is to have an entertaining area to cater to her children and grandchildren without being embarrassed. She deserves this,' Sam wrote in his touching entry.

Before the makeover Nabila's living room featured bold green checkered couches, outdated wallpaper, cluttered corners and knick-knacks piled into every corner.

Now the space looks larger, and is filled with simpler furniture in an updated colour scheme

Nabila, pictured here with husband Elias, said she loves her new lounge room too much to pick just one piece that is her favourite

There was a faded rug, ancient blinds on the windows, and pictures covering all the walls.

Now the room is full of vibrant colours, much more modern furniture and looks much more spacious than it previously did. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Nabila described the makeover as 'beautiful' and expressed her gratitude for the helping hand renovating her home.

'I just want to say thank you to everyone and I'm really glad that my son entered us in the competition,' she said.

The winner also revealed how happy the new space makes her feel and the new living room provides a great starting point for renovating the rest of her home.

Now the whole theme of the room is based around the powder blue colour on the walls

Stylist Emma Bloomfield said she designed the room to have a Scandinavian feel about it 

When asked whether she had a favourite piece in the newly transformed space, Nabila said it was too difficult to choose just one.

'To tell you the truth I love it all together.'

'It makes me feel good, and thankful for him (her son Sam)', she revealed.

Nabila also revealed she looks forward to entertaining her family in the living room, but added there was a lot of them so it still might be a bit of a squeeze.

Emma Bloomfield, stylist from TheHome.com.au helped create the transformation, said the concept for the whole room began with the colour of the walls.

'I made up a mood board and the first thing we decided was a paint colour and it all stemmed from there,' Ms Bloomfield told Daily Mail Australia.

Next on their list to tackle is the kitchen, but Nabila said the new living room gave them a great head start

'We wanted the wall to be not the average beige colour that people tend to go,' she added, before saying she wanted to room to have a Scandinavian feel to it. 

The owners moved all of the old furniture out and packed up their own possessions so nothing was lost, and in order to make room for the painters from Haymes Paint.

Once that was completed it was simply 'a matter of assembling the furniture'.

'The rug is one of my favourite pieces as well as the artwork above the smaller grey couch,' Ms Bloomfield revealed.

'And the floating shelf, the main idea behind doing that was so that we could display the family photos Nabila had.

'She had photos everywhere and we knew it was important to her to incorporate that into the room.'
