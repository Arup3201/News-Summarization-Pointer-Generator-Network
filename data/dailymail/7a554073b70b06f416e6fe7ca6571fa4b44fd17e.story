A couple are suing the Philadelphia Little League, which is home to starlet Mo'ne Davis, for more than $50,000 in damages over an errant throw.

Anand and Sujata Kumar, from New Jersey, are suing the Taney Youth Baseball Association. 

They couple filed a lawsuit last week claiming Mr Kumar, 73, was injured on May 18 last year as they watched their grandson play at Trolley Works Field.

They claim two players were tossing the ball when it hit Mr Kumar in the eye, leaving him with long-term physical and emotional damage.

The couple say the association should not have allowed players to practice near the stands. 

The lawsuit states the incident occurred during a 'game of toss and catch' between two boys who who were practising outside the fence and 'negligently close' to the stands. 

The Philadelphia Daily News first reported the lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the incident left Mr Kumar 'disabled and disordered'.

His injuries included a corneal abrasion, a 'deformed pupil,' double vision and 'multiple torn sphincter muscles'. 

Aged 13, Mo'ne became the first girl ever to throw a shutout in the history of the Little League World series and now has secured a book deal for her memoir, right

Honor roll student Mo'ne from Philadelphia became a sensation last summer after leading the Taney Dragons to a 4-0 victory over Nashville, when she was just 13. 

The team became the first Philadelphia team to make the Little League World Series. 

She became the first girl to throw a shutout in the history of the Little League World Series.

Now, she has graced the cover of Sports Illustrated, thrown out the first pitch at a major league World Series game and starred in a car commercial directed by Spike Lee. 

She has also secured a book deal and her memoir 'Mo'ne Davis: Remember My Name' will be released next March.
