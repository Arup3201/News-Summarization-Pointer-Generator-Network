Veteran full-back Paul Wellens, who led St Helens to Grand-Final glory three months ago, has been replaced as captain of the club by his former England team-mate Jon Wilkin.

The 35-year-old Wellens, who is set to start his 18th season with his home-town team, will remain part of Saints' leadership group but is expected to adopt a reduced playing role in 2015.

St Helens coach and former captain Kieron Cunningham, who succeeded Australian Nathan Brown after October's Old Trafford success, made the announcement at a press conference at Langtree Park on Wednesday morning.

'I had a discussion with Paul when I got the job,' Cunningham said. 'I was in a similar position myself, when I was captain of the team and coming off the bench or not even playing.

'Going forward, we thought it would be appropriate to appoint a new captain and Jon Wilkin is a great ambassador for the club who epitomises what we are.

'Paul is going to be around for a long time. He will play a supporting role to Wilko and will remain part of the leadership group.'

Wellens is expected to follow Cunningham on to the coaching staff when he brings his playing career to a halt.

Wilkin, who turned 32 earlier this month, missed the second half of last season with a shoulder injury but made his comeback in last Sunday's pre-season friendly against Widnes and will lead the side for Sunday's Grand Final re-match with Wigan.

'It's been an honour to play for such a fantastic club for the last 12 years and to go on and become captain is something I will be very proud to do,' said Wilkin, who joined Saints from Hull KR in 2003.

'The most exciting thing for me is that the pages of history of this club going forward are blank. What's gone is history and I am looking forward to filling the pages up with something new and something different.'

England hooker James Roby is set to take on the role of vice-captain.
