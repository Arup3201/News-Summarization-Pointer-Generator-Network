Actor Hugh Laurie has called for a Russian vodka boycott in protest against Vladimir Putin's comment that gay people are welcome at the Winter Olympics, providing they 'leave children in peace'.

In a message to his 300,000 Twitter followers, Laurie, 54, urged vodka drinkers should switch to Polish brands instead.

He wrote: 'I'd boycott Russian goods if I could think of a single thing they made besides the rest of the world depressed. Russian vodka is OK if you need to clean the oven. For drinking, it must henceforth be Polish.'

The Tweet provoked outrage in Russia, quickly becomming one of the most discussed topics on Russian-language Twitter.

Popular blogger Ilya Varlamov wrote:'I want to officially send Hugh Laurie to hell along with his opinion of our goods and his plans to boycott them.'

Another commentator Savva Mirosh, wrote on the website of state television channel NTV: 'That's right, go ahead and boycott us, but you'll have to start with gas, not vodka.'

The House and Blackadder star's tweets provoked fury in Russia and he later retracted his comments

And sports journalist Stepan Chaushyan wrote on the website of the Argumenty i Fakty mass-circulation weekly saying: 'Hugh called for a boycott of all goods produced in Russia, in passing insulting one of the main brands of our country, Russian vodka.

'Hugh forgot one thing: Russian money could very easily boycott him', pointing out that Laurie has given several blues concerts in Russia.

But the House and Blackadder star's outburst won praise from Russian gay rights supporters.

'With what irony and how correctly he noted everything. Thank you, Hugh,' wrote Matvei Alexandrov on the Gay.ru website.

Laurie later posted a message saying he 
was retracting the statement, but urged 'good, kind Russians to stand up to the 
slab-faced goons who deal in this kind of poison'.

Protests: Gay rights activists march through Moscow in protest against Russia's ant-gay propaganda laws

President Putin sparked fury earlier this month when he said that gay people would be welcome at the Sochi Winter Olympics, but added: 'They must leave children in peace'.

In June, Putin signed passed a bill to enact a new law that punishes people for promoting homosexual ‘propaganda’.

The law imposed fines on those who disseminate information aimed at minors ‘directed and forming non-traditional sexual setup’, or which may cause a ‘distorted understanding’ that gay and heterosexual relationships are equal.

Russia's powerful Orthodox Church – of which approximately 64 per cent of Russians identify themselves as – demanded one step further, calling for a national referendum on criminalising homosexual relationships altogether, a return to a Soviet law enacted by Stalin. 

Despite reassuring visitors the laws 
present 'no danger' to them, the Russian leader still suggested there 
was a need to 'clean up' homosexuality in Russian order to drive up the 
country's birth rate, and defended the country's right to pass such a 
law.

Activists and celebrities have repeatedly called on Mr Putin to repeal the law but to no avail, while there have been calls to boycott Sochi.

Laurie's former comedy partner and 'Jeeves and Wooster' co-star, Stephen Fry, who is openly gay, has backed a boycott of the Winter Olympics starting in the Russian resort city of Sochi on February 7.

In New York last summer, demonstrators poured vodka down drains to protest against Russia's law banning gay propaganda.
