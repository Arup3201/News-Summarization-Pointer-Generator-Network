A young man charged with murder has been told the case against him has been dropped and his twin charged with the crime instead.

Ductrung Huynh Tong, 18, was expected to enter a plea on murder charges yesterday when he was told in court his brother Ahn would be charged instead.

The twins were both arrested in connection with a fatal stabbing at a birthday party in San Jose, California last month and Ductrung, known as Duc, was eventually charged with murder.

When the teenager appeared in a Santa Clara Superior Court on Wednesday morning, prosecutors informed him he would instead be charged with being an accessory to murder.

Duc's twin Ahn Tong will instead be charged with murder,Â  Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office said.

The twins were taken into custody following the fatal stabbing of student Richard Phan, 22, at a birthday party in San Jose.

According to witnesses, Mr Phan, a biological science major at San Jose State University, had been trying to break up a fight outside the party in the early hours of January 26 when he was stabbed.

Officers took the Tongs into custody 
after witnesses said they were not sure which of the twin brothers 
stabbed Phan because they looked so much alike, San Jose police 
spokesman Officer Albert Morales told KTVU.com.

Duc Tong now faces two felony counts of acting as an accessory after a crime and is being held in lieu of $200,000 bail, Deputy District Attorney Dan Fehderau told San Francisco Gate.

Murder suspect Anh Tong, meanwhile, is being held without bail.

'This is an example of police keeping an open mind, basically going through their investigation and trying to get it right,' Mr Fehderau said.
