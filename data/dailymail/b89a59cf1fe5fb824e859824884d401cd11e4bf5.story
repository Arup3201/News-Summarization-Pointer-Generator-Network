Counter terrorism police started a criminal investigation last night into thousands of secret intelligence files obtained by The Guardian newspaper.

Scotland Yard said documents seized from David Miranda, partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, contained ‘highly sensitive material ... which could put lives at risk’.

Carrying documents that could be useful to terrorists carries a maximum ten-year jail sentence under the controversial Terrorism Act 2000.

Challenge: David Miranda, pictured with his partner Glenn Greenwald, has won a bid to stop the British authorities from using the data they seized from him at Heathrow on Sunday

Officers who questioned the 
28-year-old Brazilian for nearly nine hours at Heathrow have now begun 
an international investigation into how he was carrying ‘tens of 
thousands’ of pages of material including secret files leaked by ex-CIA 
analyst Edward Snowden.

He 
was travelling en route from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, on a 
flight paid for by The Guardian, when he was stopped by police. His 
partner Mr Greenwald has written several stories based on the documents 
leaked from the US National Security Agency.

After
Mr Miranda’s detention it emerged that David Cameron had explicitly 
authorised the destruction of computers at The Guardian offices which 
are believed to have held sensitive details.

Victory: Ms Morgan outside court following the awarding of an interim injunction

The
police investigation is likely to explore whether Mr Miranda and 
journalists at The Guardian were in breach of the Terrorism Act 2000. 
The law states that a person is committing an offence if he or she 
collects or makes a record of information likely to be useful to a 
terrorist.

Last night Scotland Yard remained tight-lipped over whether detectives would be taking in journalists for questioning.

Speaking
at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, Guardian editor Alan 
Rusbridger said he did not know if he would be investigated. ‘It looks 
like they’re mounting a criminal investigation into persons unknown,’ he
said.

Asked about the 
investigation, he said: ‘I don’t know anything about it. All I know is 
that they’ve said they’re threatening to prosecute someone.’

Controversy: The Guardian's computer components, including the motherboard and solid-state hard drive destroyed in the interests of national security

Earlier
in the day the High Court heard that the Metropolitan Police had taken 
possession of ‘tens of thousands of pages of material’ from Mr Miranda’s
electronic equipment.

Judges
ruled that the security services could examine the seized material for 
national security purposes and investigate whether Mr Miranda is a 
person who is or has been concerned with the commission, preparation or 
instigation of acts of terrorism.

Jonathan
Laidlaw, QC, representing the Met, said the data contains ‘highly 
sensitive material the disclosure of which would be gravely injurious to
public safety’.

He 
said the investigation was being carried out by counter terrorism 
officers, but declined to give further details. ‘I am not prepared to 
alert defendants here or abroad about the criminal investigation that 
has begun,’ he added.

Mr 
Miranda’s lawyers had sought an injunction to prevent access to the 
data, arguing his detention was unlawful and threatened ‘journalistic 
sources whose confidential information is contained in the material 
seized’.

Row: David Cameron asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to contact the Guardian about the classified material handed over by Edward Snowden, which led to the destruction of hard drives

It has been confirmed that Theresa May (pictured) knew that Mr Miranda would be detained

They said he had 
had nine items, including his laptop, mobile phone, memory cards and 
DVDs, taken during his detention on Sunday.

Speaking
after the case Gwendolen Morgan, from law firm Bindmans, said the 
Government now has seven days to ‘prove there is a genuine threat to 
national security’. She added that she knew ‘very little’ about the 
criminal inquiries.

Last 
night a police spokesman said: ‘The Metropolitan Police Service is 
pleased that the High Court has rejected an attempt to prevent further 
examination of material seized during the detention of a man under 
Schedule 7 at Heathrow Airport.

‘We
welcome the decision of the court which allows our examination of the 
material – containing thousands of classified intelligence documents – 
to continue in order to protect life and national security.

‘Initial
examination of material seized has identified highly sensitive 
material, the disclosure of which could put lives at risk.’

A
Guardian spokesman said: ‘It remains our position that David Miranda 
was involved in legitimate journalistic activity. We have no details of 
any criminal inquiry launched today and have not had any contact with 
the police regarding this matter.’

The
Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation has said he will examine 
the use of anti-terror powers to detain Mr Miranda. David Anderson has 
written to Home Secretary Theresa May to outline his reasons for looking
at the case. He said he wanted to establish if Schedule 7 of the 
Terrorism Act 2000 was ‘lawfully, appropriately and humanely used’.
