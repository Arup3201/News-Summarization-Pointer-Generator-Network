John Simpson has revealed he would commit suicide if old age were to leave him incapacitated.

The 67-year-old veteran broadcaster said he would rather end his life than become a ‘gibbering wreck’ who is totally reliant on his wife or carer to manage basic functions.

Speaking at the launch of the BBC1 documentary When I Get Older, part of the When I’m 65 series that broadcasts next week, he said: ‘I’m working out new ways to make sure I don’t end up... utterly dependent on somebody whose life I’m [making difficult].’

Earlier this week, the BBC World Affairs editor had hailed 65 as ‘the new 55’. But in his latest comments, he said although he is less worried about getting older and dying he wanted to do it on his own terms.

Simpson, who became a father again at 
the age of 61, explained: ‘I’m not advocating [euthanasia] for anyone 
else. But in my own case, I don’t want my own six-year-old son to have 
his main memories of me as a gibbering, sad old wreck. I’d rather take 
the early way out, rather than to hang on purely for the sake of being 
alive.’

The veteran war reporter also admitted he was less worried about getting older and dying after making the programme but wanted to do it on his own terms.

He insisted he was not campaigning for assisted death but felt he personally would prefer to die and leave his family positive memories of a healthy and capable man, than be left alive but unable to function.

The BBC World Affairs correspondent married South African Ms Kruger – who is 19 years his junior and was formerly his producer - in 1996. He became a father again at 61.

But pro-life campaigners have expressed their concern.

A spokesman for Care Not Killing said it was 'unhelpful' that death was presented as a solution.

He said: ‘This is a deeply sad statement from a well-respected BBC figure. These kind of beliefs are motivated by a fear of getting older in this country.

‘What we are campaigning for is that older people get better quality care and good palliative care if they are sick.’

In the programme Simpson, presenter Gloria Hunniford, actress Lesley Joseph, and comedian Tony Robinson, all spend time with elderly individuals and are tasked with encouraging older people to become more active.

He added that his research for the programme, which also spends time in a care home for those suffering with Alzheimers’ Disease, had made him feel 'less frightened' about getting old and dying.

The BBC World Affairs correspondent explained: ‘If only you have the ability and the freedom to manage the way you live, I now realise, even your last days can be spent in peace and harmony.'

Robinson was brutal in his appraisal of UK care homes and said Britons needed to change their attitude towards the elderly.

He said: ‘I think care homes are prisons that people are sent to as a punishment for being old. The problem for me having spent time in one is that every moment is being prescribed.

‘In 150 years I hope people will look back on the way we treat the elderly now with the same kind of horror as child labour.’

Life expectancy in Britain is now 78.2 years for a man and 82.3 years for a woman but the Office of National Statistics believe by 2030 it both sexes will live, on average, to the age of 87.

In Britain, women have a 50 per cent chance of being a carer by the time they are 59.

Robinson said that families are being exploited because the Government has failed to come up with a viable solution for people nursing their loved ones.

He said: ‘There needs to be more support for carers. We consign the people that love [the elderly and infirm] most, to poverty and the most horrendous life because they are the person that will be there and care.

‘The modern way is that when people are 65 we eject them from society and isolate them by putting them in homes. There is going to have to be societal change.’

Robinson’s comments echo the views of acclaimed author Sir Terry Pratchett who he revealed he was battling Alzheimer’s Disease In 2007, aged just 57 and has campaigned for better care for sufferers.

Earlier this year, he accused the Government of making dementia sufferers feel like ‘malingerers’ who don’t have a proper disease.

He said it was unfair that families were ‘bankrupting’ themselves paying for dementia care when treatment for other conditions is free on the NHS. 

In 2011, the writer made controversial documentary Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, which broadcast on the BBC and led to accusations the broadcaster was acting as a “cheerleader for assisted death”.

Almost 900 viewers made formal complaints to the corporation about the programme, which filmed the death of motor neurone sufferer Peter Smedley, while just 82 contacted the broadcaster to praise it.

Four senior Peers accused the BBC of running a 'repugnant' and 'disgraceful' 'orchestrated campaign' to change the law on assisted death.

Religious leaders, charities, and politicians also joined the chorus of criticism the accusing the BBC2 documentary of being ‘one-sided’ and ‘propaganda’ for euthanasia. 

Opposition to assisted death has been based on grounds of public safety and this is reflected in the views of the organisations representing disabled people as well as the British Medical Association and Royal Colleges which do not wish to see doctors and nurses required to take the lives of their patients.

The BBC is broadcasting a week of programmes about old age as part of its When I am 65 season, which begins on July 4.
