You may like to think that your partner imagines getting intimate with you and only you, but it would appear there are other things on his mind when it comes to sex.

And they include threesomes, having sex with your friends, sleeping with their colleagues and being more adventurous in bed, according to a new survey by Cosmopolitan magazine.

Some 50 per cent of engaged men secretly
 wish they could have sex with a female friend, while 18 per cent of married 
men would like to sleep with a colleague.

The Cosmopolitan sex survey lifts the lid on what men are really thinking about when they're in bed

Just under a third (32 per cent) of men in a
 relationship want to sleep with their a friend' girlfriend, and 32 per cent 
of single men want to have sex with an ex.

While most men surveyed have slept with just 
one to three women, an energetic three per cent claim their 'number' is over 100 - but only half have had a one night stand.

When asked if they 
could change one thing about their sexual past, 36 per cent wish they'd slept 
with more women and 32 per cent wish they'd been more adventurous.

And when quizzed about infidelity, 42 per cent said they had cheated - and of those, 82 per cent said they felt guilty afterwards, and cited boredom as
 their reason for being unfaithful.

British men seem to like variety, too: 37 per cent boast having filmed themselves having sex, 72 per cent have had text sex, 28 per cent have tried S&M, and 23 per cent would be keen to try bondage.

But a threesome is still the number one fantasy - over half the 732 men polled would be interested in introducing a third party to the bedroom.

The survey also unearthed further secrets about men's sexual habits. Some 37 per cent of men who watch porn - 11 per cent of whom watch it every single day - feel the need to hide it from their partner.

Some 26 per cent of men in a relationship have 
enjoyed a private dance in a strip club, and 15 per cent have hooked up sexually 
with someone theyâ€™ve met on Facebook.

When it comes to their ideal woman, men say confidence is key, with 76 per cent saying they want a partner who knows what she's doing. Nearly half of all men questioned (44 per cent) think kissing is the most intimate thing a couple can do.

faithful, with 70 per cent having never cheated on a partner.

Those in 
the West Midlands are the most promiscuous, and 76 per cent in the East 
of England have texted a naked photo.

In
 terms of the ex-factor, 46 per cent of London-based men have 
fantastised about a former partner while having sex with their current 
squeeze, and 63 per cent of men in Scotland would like to have 'ex-sex'.

Louise Court, Editor of Cosmopolitan, said: 'British men are pretty hypocritical when it comes to sex.

'As a lot of the men we surveyed said they'd be put off if a girl had slept with between six and 20 men - while they wanted to sleep with loads of women. It takes two to tango.

'They love to see themselves as these Casanova figures having this fantasy world of sex. It's often not very realistic.

'It's very easy for men to reveal their innermost thoughts from the comfort of their armchairs, living in a lad culture with no consequences.

'But they need to separate fantasy from reality - a lot of women would like to have sex with David Beckham and have a wardrobe full of Louboutins but it doesn't mean it's going to happen.'
