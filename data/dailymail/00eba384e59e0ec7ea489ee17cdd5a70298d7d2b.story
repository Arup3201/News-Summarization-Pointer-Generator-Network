Manufacturing firms could see their energy costs fall by £7billion.

George Osborne said he would cap taxes on carbon emissions, compensate heavy industry for other green taxes and extend tax breaks for investment.

Together, the measures could save a medium-sized manufacturing business £50,000 a year, the Chancellor told MPs yesterday.

Glowing praise: Tony Pedder, who says cuts to carbon tax will help firms

Capping
 the tax on carbon use will help factories that are forced to shut down 
temporarily to save on high energy costs, one boss said last night.

Tony
 Pedder, of Sheffield Forgemasters, expects his steel plant to shut down
 30 times over the coming months because of energy costs.

Its massive furnaces require enormous amounts of power – costs that are pushed up by the Government’s green taxes.

Mr Pedder warned this left British companies struggling to compete with foreign rivals.Yesterday
 he said: ‘The Government has recognised there is an issue with 
competitiveness. It is a step towards a more competitive environment for
 Forgemasters and many other manufacturing companies.’

He intends to cap the carbon price floor, which sets the minimum levy imposed on factories and businesses for the amount of carbon dioxide they emit.

It was due to hit £18.08 a tonne in 2015, rising to £30 for ten years from 2016. But it will now stay at the 2015 level until 2026.

The change to the tax, which particularly
 affects big energy users such as steel plants, paper mills and other 
large manufacturers, could save industry up to £4billion by 2018 and a 
further £1.5billion in 2019, while shaving £15 off a typical household 
energy bill.

Mr Osborne said: ‘We need to cut our energy costs.’

 In
 addition, he said he would extend compensation to those firms most 
affected by the taxes to 2020.

A new scheme will also be set up to 
refund energy-intensive industries for levies passed on to them from 
wind and solar power.

And firms that use fuel to generate both heat and power will be exempted from carbon taxes.

A typical energy-intensive business in Britain pays almost 50 per cent more for their electricity than those in France.

The move will particularly benefit the most energy-intensive manufacturers, around 80 per cent of which are based in the North, Scotland and Wales.

The Chancellor’s move against green taxes comes after the Prime Minister reportedly told ministers to ‘get rid of all the green c**p’ last autumn, and follows Mr Osborne’s pledge in December to cut £50 from household energy bills.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey has also refused to accept proposals for legally binding EU targets for renewable energy production after 2020, which would have driven energy prices up.

Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, said: ‘Taken together with measures to boost investment, exports and skills, the Chancellor deserves a pat on the back.’

Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steel union Community, said: ‘It’s good the Government is finally listening.

'We’ve been saying for years that industry needed help to reduce its energy costs and now the Chancellor has admitted the Government has been getting it wrong.’

But the move was criticised by climate-change experts. Economist Nicholas Stern said the change would create uncertainty for green investment.

‘Chancellors cannot resist the temptation to fiddle,’ Lord Stern said. ‘Fiddling creates policy uncertainty and that in turn reduces investment including, and critically, in the energy sector by raising the cost of capital.’

Company car drivers will be hit by a 2 per cent increase in Britain’s favourite executive perk.

But there will be an increase in discounts for ultra-low emission vehicles and a reduction in the rate of fuel duty for methanol.

Under the Chancellor’s planned 2 per cent increase in company car tax each year to 2018/19 a £19,000 Volkswagen Golf 1.4 TSI with 123g/km CO2 emissions will cost a higher rate tax payer an additional £608 a year by 2018/19.

A £38,000 BMW 525d will see hikes of £1,215 across the same period.

But sharing their pain will be those with low emission or electric cars such as the Nissan Leaf Vista, say accountants. Drivers of this £26,000 car will see its tax bill increase from nothing – if it was first acquired in or before 2014/15 – to £1,350 in 2018/19.

Ashley Hollinshead, of Deloitte, said: ‘Even those opting for the ultra-green electric cars are starting to bring with them some hefty bills.’

The three-wheeler Reliant Robin is to be classed as a classic car exempt from road tax.

Previously only cars built before January 1, 1973 were exempt. The Robin – first manufactured in October 1973 by the Reliant motor company from Tamworth in Staffordshire – will now escape under a rolling 40-year vehicle excise duty exemption rule coming in from April 1.

A true classic: The Reliant Robin

Although scorned by some the Robin, last made in 1981, proved popular. It is not to be confused with its older van-like sibling the Reliant Regal, above, which ‘Del Boy’ Trotter drove in Only Fools And Horses. It was already exempt.

Other cars that come into the classic exempt category now include the Austin Allegro and the MGB V. Drivers of other cars will see their road tax go up in line with RPI inflation from April 1.
