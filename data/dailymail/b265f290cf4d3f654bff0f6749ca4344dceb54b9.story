Manchester City's Champions League hopes suffered a potentially devastating blow after Sergio Aguero limped out of the win over Everton in tears with a knee injury.

The Premier League's 14-goal top scorer was hurt after just 75 seconds of the match at the Etihad when Aguero appeared to jar his left knee following a tackle by Muhamed Besic moments after he had picked himself up from another challenge by Seamus Coleman.

The Argentina striker is now a major doubt for City's potential Group E decider away to Roma on Wednesday night with Manuel Pellegrini's side needing a positive result in the Stadio Olimpico to stand any chance of reaching the knockout stage of the Champions League.

Aguero has been in the form of his life with 19 goals in 20 games in all competitions this season – including the dramatic late hat-trick against Bayern Munich last month that revived City's hopes of qualification – and losing him would be a huge setback to the Premier League champions.

The striker's tears as he limped forlornly around the outside of the pitch on Saturday, aided by a member of City's medical team, did not bode well, and Pellegrini is not expecting Aguero to be available for Wednesday showdown.

'Probably he will miss the game,' Pellegrini told Sky Sports.'If you have a problem in the ligament it is difficult to recover in three days.' 

If Aguero is indeed out City must go to Rome and prove they are not a one-man team – something Pellegrini disputed in his match programme notes on Saturday following the striker's two-goal display at Sunderland in midweek.

'Sergio of course gets a lot of the headlines and right now it's difficult for defences to stop him,' wrote Pellegrini. 'He is also working hard to improve, too.

'The team is not just about Sergio. We have excellent players all over the pitch. He is a very good player but it was the team that dominated the game. All the players had a high performance.'

With Stevan Jovetic rested as a precaution on Saturday and Edin Dzeko returning on the bench after a month out with a calf injury, Pellegrini replaced Aguero with youngster Jose Angel Pozo for only his second Premier League appearance.

But Aguero's injury has once again raised questions over the wisdom of City letting Alvaro Negredo join Valencia on loan in the summer without signing a replacement.
