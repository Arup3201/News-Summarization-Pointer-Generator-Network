Anyone who has watched Frank Lampard play football will have noticed his goal celebration - he raises the index finger of his right hand and points at the sky, lifting his eyes in the direction of the heavens.

Frank, who is England's midfielder and Chelsea's all-time best goal scorer, has performed this small, yet significant, ritual since the day his mother, Pat, died after a short bout of pneumonia in 2008.

Pat was 58 and her death was sudden and unexpected, and while Frank admits he struggled to come to terms with it, he has used her as inspiration in both his football and when penning his children's books.

His biggest inspiration: Football ace Frank Lampard says that his greatest inspiration in life, and behind his children's books, is his mother Pat, right, who passed away in 2008

Speaking about his series of books, Frankie's Magic Football, the 36-year-old said: 'My mum, who sadly passed away, will always be my biggest inspiration.' 

Frank, who has two children with his former fiancee, Spanish model Elen Rivas, added: 'I feel most inspired at home with my daughters.

'Thinking about what they would like to read helps me to come up with ideas. So, often inspiration comes to me when I'm reading to them, or telling them made-up stories.

'Chatting to my daughters and hearing the often funny things that they come up with helps me to get creative.'

Salute: Frank's goal celebration, where he raises the index finger of his right hand and points at the sky, lifting his eyes in the direction of the heavens, is a tribute to his late mother

Story time: Frank, who has two daughters with his former fiancee, Spanish model Elen Rivas, said he is inspired by his children's ideas and funny stories 

Inspired 
by the football stories he invented for his own children, his books tell
 the tale of a group of friends who are whisked off on incredible 
adventures by a magical football.

Sharing how he researches the story ideas for his books, which are aimed at five-year-olds and older, he said:
 'My stories are about football and fantasy, with a bit of magic thrown 
in.

'This means that most of the research comes from my own experiences 
on the pitch, combined with where I think that it would be cool to play a
 football match. Like on a pirate ship, or in ancient Egypt!'

Chelsea teammates - including Fernando Torres and John Terry -
 better watch out, when asked who inspires the villains in his tales, he
 added: 'Some of the characters in my series are based on the team 
members I play football with. It's always fun to think about who could 
be the next character when I'm playing football with them.' 

Frank, who cites Roald Dahl's BFG as his favourite book, said
 that if an idea feels forced or you don't love it, then it's usually 
not the right one. 'Trust your instinct', he says about getting 
creative.

Talents: While he may be Chelsea's best ever goalscorer, Frank has also written children's books, right

Frank is encouraging Brits to enter The Big Idea - a competition to discover original story ideas for children and offers one lucky winner the prize of publishing contract and the promise of their idea being nurtured, developed and written by a well-known author. The judging panel includes Tess Daly, Neil Blair (JK Rowling’s agent) and Sonia Friedman. Enter at thebigideacompetition.co.uk
