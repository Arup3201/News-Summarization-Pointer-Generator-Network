Cunning: A student managed to post a very rude message in her yearbook by writing it in a periodic table code

A student managed to post a very rude message in her yearbook by writing it in a periodic table code.

Jessica Lee's message managed to get past teachers and ended up in print under her smiling photo.

The message read: '(F) flourine (U) uranium (C) carbon (K) potassium (Bi) bismuth (Tc) technetium (He) helium (S) sulfur (Ge) germanium (Tm) thulium (O) oxygen (Ne) neon (Y) yttrium.'

But eagle-eyed users on Reddit soon realised that once the words were removed Jessica Lee had actually written: 'F*** B****** Get Money.'

Last
year officials at a California high school apologized to parents after 
failing to spot a handful of sexually suggestive quotes in its yearbook 
before it went to print.

Three
male seniors from University City High School in San Diego submitted 
sexual innuendos as the quotes to accompany their photographs in the 
yearbook.

Oops: Three high school students included sexually suggestive quotes with their yearbook photographs - but the school's staff failed to spot them before the books went to print

The comments, which refer to the students pleasuring themselves and committing sex acts, were not caught by teachers who proof-read the book, which has already been distributed to students.

But while teachers failed to read into the captions, one eagle-eyed parent noticed them while flicking through the book and immediately contacted the school, KFMB reported.

One Reddit user posted: 'This is the yearbook for Garfield high school in seattle and this particular senior quote caused a semi s**storm along with other yearbook oversights so that every person had to get correction stickers put in their yearbooks before they could finish the year/graduate.'
