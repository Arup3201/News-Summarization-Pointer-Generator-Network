Donald Sterling has lost his bid to halt the sale of his basketball team the Los Angeles Clippers.

In a preliminary ruling today in an LA court, Judge Michael Levanas ruled that his wife Shelly Sterling has full control of the family trust that owns the team - paving the way for a $2 billion sale to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

In court, the judge said that 'Shelly clearly had the authoritiy to transfer the shares' of the team and dismissed the claims of her disgraced husband who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and therefore unable to manage his affairs.

Judge Michael Levanas said the deal, 
brokered by Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly Sterling, was permissible 
and could be consummated even if Sterling, who has been banned for life 
from the NBA for racist remarks, chose to appeal.

'She
 had every good reason to believe that Donald agreed to the sale of the 
team,' Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas said.

The judge said his tentative ruling would take formal effect when he issues it in writing in coming weeks.

'Either way, we'd win,' Shelly Sterling said outside the courtroom. 'I am just doing what I had to do.'

Donald Sterling claimed his wife deceived him about the medical exams.

Sterling has vowed to fight the NBA until his death and is expected to continue to wage court battles to stop the sale.

The ruling in Los Angeles County Superior Court is unlikely to put an end to the bizarre saga that began in April when a recording surfaced of Sterling scolding his young girlfriend V. Stiviano for bringing black men to Clippers games.

The NBA moved quickly to ban Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million.

Sterling was apologetic after the audio recording went viral, but his mea culpa backfired when he criticized Lakers great Magic Johnson, who had been photographed with Sterling's girlfriend, as a bad role model for kids because he had HIV.

Sterling was roundly criticized from locker rooms to the Oval Office, where President Barack Obama called Sterling's remarks 'incredibly offensive racist statements.'

With the NBA threatening to seize the team and auction it, Sterling initially gave his wife of 58 years permission to negotiate a sale but then refused to sign it.

He said he would sue the league instead and then revoked the trust.

The nonjury trial held over several weeks focused mainly on whether Shelly Sterling properly removed her husband as a trustee and whether her actions carried any weight after he revoked the trust.

Donald Sterling's lawyers contended that his wife and her lawyers conspired to trick him and that the mental exams by two doctors were faulty.

They said Sterling didn't know his competency as a trustee was being evaluated and that he showed no signs of incompetence on the witness stand.

In combative testimony, Sterling said he would 'never, ever sell' the team he bought in 1981 for about $12 million.

Before taking the stand, he kissed his wife and then testified that he loved her. But the following day when she approached him in court he yelled, 'get away from me, you pig!'

Sterling, a lawyer who made a fortune as a landlord, has filed an antitrust lawsuit in federal court against the NBA and he sued his wife, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and the league in state court.

Lawyers for Shelly Sterling and Ballmer had urged the judge to let the sale go through because it was in the best interest of the family trust.

They said an auction was less likely to bring such a high price and that coach Doc Rivers, key players and sponsors were likely to walk if Donald Sterling's ownership was prolonged.

'The trust has a golden bird in the hand,' Shelly Sterling's lawyers wrote in court papers. 'A sale of the Clippers for $2 billion is indisputably a bonanza for the Sterling family. Donald's strident opposition is motivated by only selfish considerations.'

Donald Sterling said he could get more for the team by also selling TV rights and through his $9 billion suit against the league.
