Airport staff are searching for the owner of a 100-year-old Teddy bear found abandoned in a departure lounge. 

The antique bear, which has one eye and a floppy ear, was found in a bag with a frayed black and white photo dated March 1918 of him in better days being cuddled by two little girls.

Unlike famous Paddington, the bear has no tag which says 'Please look after this bear', but a message in faded ink on the back of the photo which reads: 'With dearest love and kisses to our darling Daddie from your loving little daughters Dora and Glyn.'

Staff at Bristol Airport have spent 14 months trawling flight records to see if they could find any two passengers with the same names.

They are now appealing to the public to help return the Teddy, named Bristol by staff, to his rightful owner.

'He's well-loved, that is for sure', said Jacqui Mills, spokeswoman for Bristol Airport.  

'He looks a bit battered but I think that's because he has been given so many cuddles over the years.

'He was with lost property and we were certain that someone would claim him, but when they didn't he was passed over to the airport police who took very good care of him and tried every means possible to find his family.'

The postcard photograph has a second message which reads: 'Taken on baby's birthday March 4th 1918, one year and five-months-old.'

Ms Mills said: 'Photographs were such a rare thing in those days and would not have been taken very often.

'A photograph celebrating a birthday may have been taken a few months after the date.'

Bristol Bear is now living on the corner of Jacqui's desk.

She said: 'We've no idea how he came to be in the airport, or what the story is behind him.

'It would be so lovely to perhaps find Dora and Glyn or their family and reunite them with this gorgeous bear.

'He has a missing eye, a very floppy ear and I think he has had an operation to his tummy at some point, but I'm certain he has a few more cuddles in him yet.'

Jasper Pearson, son of Sue Pearson who is one of the world's experts on vintage Teddy bears, said this is an early German bear which would have been made between 1907 and 1910. 

'I cannot say it's a Steiff without looking at it in person but in its current condition even with the lovely photo is is worth about £350. If we could confirm it was a Steiff it would be worth considerably more.' 

If the make was a Steiff, Mr Pearson said it could be worth more than £1,000. 

‘Collectors always love bears with provenance, and a nice photo of a young owner with their bear is always much sought after,' he said. 

'Steiff were certainly the most famous maker of bears before the First World War but certainly not the only one. 

'Many of these early factories left few records to help identify the bears they made. We are only able to identify which country they were made in by the design and quality of mohair used to make them’.
