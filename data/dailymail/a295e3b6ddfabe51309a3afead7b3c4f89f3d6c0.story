A tiny kitten has been nursed back to health after climbing into a washing machine and surviving a 50-minute cycle at 50C.

Poppet, the miracle moggy, came out in the wash after hiding in the laundry when owner Laura Gilhome's back was turned.

After clambering in among the dirty washing, the seven-week-old found herself stuck in a full cycle, rendering her little body unconscious.

Lucky Poppet is back in the arms of six-year-old Megan Gilholme at home in Audenshaw, Greater Manchester after surviving a 50 minute washing cycle at 50 degrees

A neighbour gave Poppet mouth to mouth to help revive her after she fell unconscious in the washing machine

Ms Gilholme, 27, of Audenshaw, Greater Manchester said she only discovered the plight of her miracle moggy when the wash finished and she opened the machine doors.

She said: 'I was halfway through putting in a load and she must have jumped into the machine without me knowing.

'I only realised what had happened when the wash had finished and I’d opened the door.

'She was unconscious and my neighbour tried to do mouth to mouth but then we rushed her to the vets.

'There was no response from her and we really thought she had died.'

Miracle moggy Poppet has failed to learn her lesson - moments after arriving home with owners Laura and Megan Gilholme, the cheeky kitten jumped straight back in the machine

But vet John Gunn, in nearby Denton, managed to revive Poppet's limp body and helped nurse her back to health.

And despite being reunited with Ms Gilholme and her six-year-old daughter Megan, the mischievous kitten showed she has not learned her lesson, jumping straight back into the washer-dryer when she made it home.

Ms Gilholme said: 'I really thought that was it and didn’t think she would survive. John really did save her life.'

'The first thing she did when she got home was jump straight into the dryer so we know she’s back to her usual mischievous self.'

Vet Mr Gunn said Poppet was an ‘incredibly lucky cat’.

'I really didn’t think she had a hope,' he said. 'I live above the surgery so stayed up with her through the night and kept her in for an extra 48 hours and she was soon eating me out of house and home.

'I think she’s definitely used up one of her nine lives.

'But this should serve as a gentle reminder to pet owners with young animals.'
