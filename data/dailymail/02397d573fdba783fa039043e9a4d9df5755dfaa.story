Simon Wright, 37, outside Hammersmith Magistrates' Court today, where his claims he was not well enough to do community service were rebuffed

A man who makes £50,000 a year on the streets told a court his ill health would not permit him to do community service today as he was spared jail for repeatedly breaching an Asbo.

Simon Wright, 37, a 'workshy' serial beggar who lives in a £300,000 council flat in Fulham, south west London, told magistrates that his epilepsy and asthma meant he couldn't do the community work he was ordered to do instead of a jail term.

But the court today ordered him to carry out 40 hours of community work, as magistrate Jacqueline Jenkins said: 'Begging is a form of working - it strikes us that Mr Wright should try to do something more constructive'.

Wright, who claims he begs because his benefits are not sufficient, was spotted pleading for cash in London's Leicester Square just weeks after magistrates ordered him to stop operating in the capital.

He was arrested and bailed, only to start begging again in nearby Oxford Circus.

Sentencing Wright to a 12-month community and supervision order and 40 hours' unpaid work today , chairwoman of the bench Mrs Jenkins told Wright he was lucky to escape prison.

She said: 'You have got an Asbo: you know what that is, yet you seem to disregard it. That is going to remain in place.

'We are going to treat you fairly leniently today but if you keep breaching it can be a custodial sentence and that would be a shame, if only because of your dog.

'What would happen to it if you were in custody?

'We are sentencing you to a community order for 12 months with supervision for 12 months; we hope you get something out of this in terms of your addiction of begging.

'We are also giving you 40 hours' unpaid work. We hope that you enter into the spirit of that.'

Wright banged on the the dock at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court and shouted out, interrupting the hearing to say he is too sick to do unpaid work because he suffers from asthma and epilepsy.

A JP at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court dismissed Wright's health fears, saying 'We are not asking the impossible.'

But magistrates said there was nothing stopping him carrying out the work unless he was 'work-shy'.

Mrs Jenkins said: 'Begging is a form of working, he can be outside during daylight hours and he can stand and sit and talk to people.

'We are not asking the impossible. Rather than working as a beggar it strikes us that Mr Wright should try to do something more constructive.'

Wright has regularly been seen in ragged clothes sitting on the pavement of Putney High Street in South London, with a handwritten sign claiming he was 'Homeless and hungry'.

But in fact he was pocketing as much as £300 a day and returning home each night to his Fulham flat.

In May magistrates handed him an Asbo which banned him from begging anywhere in London for two years and from having a dog unmuzzled.

But the serial beggar was spotted by Westminster Council street wardens asking for money in Leicester Square on 9 July.

Just a week later he flouted the order again, and was seen begging and with an unmuzzled dog in Oxford Street, central London.

At the May hearing, magistrates were told Wright regularly went into betting shops and amusement arcades to change his coins for notes which totted up as much as £300 a day.

But despite receiving state hand-outs and living in a taxpayer-funded housing association flat, he pleaded poverty and said he begged for cash because he couldn't afford to live on his benefits.

  'He suffers from asthma and epilepsy and he says that is going to be an issue with unpaid work.'

  

      - Wright's lawyer Edgar Fernando

Edgar Fernando, defending, told the court: 'Mr Wright is begging because the benefits he relies on don't work out for him to live on.

'He is receiving state benefits and after paying for food and bills he is left with £35 a fortnight; ultimately this is the reason he begs.

'He suffers from asthma and epilepsy and he says that is going to be an issue with unpaid work. He says that if you hand him that you will be setting him up to fail.'

But Mrs Jenkins rebuffed this claim and said:  'Having asthma and epilepsy doesn't stop you from doing that work'.

At a previous hearing the 37 year-old was handed a conditional discharge for two breaches of his Asbo after he was seen begging in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham on 4 June and on Gloucester Road in west London on 12 June.

But the sentence has been found to be improper and he was resentenced to another 12-month community order with supervision to run concurrently.

Wright had pleaded guilty to all four charges of breaching an Asbo and did not reply when asked if he would stop begging for good as he left court today.
