Frank Lampard admits he is surprised at just how well things have gone since signing for Manchester City this summer and appreciates the backing fans have given him.

The former Chelsea midfielder - released by the Blues at the end of last season - signed for New York City FC in June before joining Manuel Pellegrini's side on loan for the start of the current campaign.

Since joining the current Premier League champions the 36-year-old has been in fine form and has scored three goals in eight games, most recently during Sunday's 3-0 win over Southampton, as City look to close the gap on Lampard's former club at the top of the table.

Asked if he could believe how well things had gone since his moved to the North West, Lampard said: 'No, I didn't really know what to imagine.

'After such a long time at one club you're so ingrained in that club, you come to a different one I think all I wanted to show was that I'm here to work hard and try and help in any way I can.

'At moments I've been able to do that and I think fans appreciate that. I certainly appreciate it back - it's been very nice for me to come up here to such a big club and get that reaction straight away.'
