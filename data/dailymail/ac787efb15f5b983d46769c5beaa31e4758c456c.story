STATEMENT BY GARRY BEERS 

I am deeply hurt and saddened to see the article written by my daughter Lucy Mae and the subsequent reporting of that story by other media outlets in Australia and around the world. Lucy and those who have published similar stories have chosen to misrepresent the truth about me and my wife, Jourdan.

Lucy makes a series of hurtful allegations against me, each of which is untrue. She claims that I slept with a backup singer while my pregnant wife was at home with a brand new Harley Davidson she had bought for me. This is untrue.

She claims that I am married to 'the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside'. This is also untrue. I did not meet my current wife, Jourdan, until five years after my first wife and I were divorced. Jourdan has never stood outside a gig while my family were inside. I didn't even know Jourdan at the time this supposedly took place. The last show that my ex-wife and the girls attended was the Stadium Australia concert in 2000 with Terrance Trent Darby.

I am not perfect and I am the first to admit it. Yes, I had an affair during the 1997 tour. This was the only affair I ever had, and I told my then-wife straight away.

Lucy claims that I have been a neglectful father, and that I have been in contact with her 'less than a dozen' times a year. This is also untrue. I have always tried to maintain a relationship with Lucy and Matilda, but this was difficult in the years 2006 – 2009 when their mother's legal suit against me was on foot. During that period, meetings with the girls were often cancelled at the last minute and on more than one occasion I was met by a court process server instead.

Up until 2013, I have been back and forth to Australia on average every 3 months during the year and I have always tried to make contact with my daughters. In 2011 Lucy and Matilda attended an INXS concert in Victoria and I spent a day with each of them over the next few days.

In happier days: Garry Beers has hit back at claims Lucy-Mae Beers made, describing how her father (pictured with her as a child) did not accept it when INXS's fame 'fell to the wayside'

Garry Beers says Lucy Mae's claims that she is only in contact with him via email is untrue 

Lucy's claim that she was 'lucky to get an email on her birthday' is both untrue and extremely hurtful. In January this year I sent the girls 8 hours of video footage from their childhood on a hard drive that I painstakingly put together. They loved it.

Lucy and I were sending each other long and detailed emails up until June this year. She was the one who mentioned that the INXS mini-series was to feature Hugh Sheridan and that she was excited as he was one of her favourite actors. She claims that I sent 'a lovely egotistical email' to her asking 'What did you think of Hugh Sheridan playing myself?'.

This is an extract from the email she sent to me:

'We have been keeping updated with the news on the INXS mini-series and have heard that Hugh Sheridan is playing you! He is on a great Aussie TV drama called 'Packed to the Rafters' and is a sensational actor (he's huge here) and we love him! So that's amazing.'

My email to her when the mini-series aired was:

Hey Lucy, did you watch the Miniseries..??

He refutes Lucy's claims that he is 'now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside' writing that he didn't meet his wife, Jourdan, until five years after he and his first wife were divorced

Lucy also claims that 'he told us he was packing up and moving to the United States to marry one of his conquests on the day we were moving house'. This is untrue. My divorce with my first wife had been finalized in 2001. In 2004 I sold the Mangrove property, where I had lived for 20 years and where my two recording studios were located. I did not meet my wife Jourdan until October 2005. I did not move to the United States until November 2006.

Lucy claims that I 'thrived off a diet of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll'. This is untrue. Anyone who has met me will know that I am a decent guy and a good father. It is sad that my relationship with Lucy and Matilda has soured. I will take my share of the blame for that, but I will not take it all.

Lucy also claims, sadly, that I have 'Peter Pan syndrome'. I can only assume that she means that I am immature, child-like and divorced from reality. This is untrue.

Lucy-Mae Beers (left), with her sister, Matilda, told how her father is a 'stranger' to her. Garry Beers said he wishes Lucy had just picked up the phone instead of publishing the scathing article. 

Lucy's mother and I divorced 13 years ago. The INXS miniseries aired in February this year. I am saddened that my daughter has chosen now, as she seeks to embark on a career in journalism, to publish this story. If she really does believe all of these untruths about me, I wish she had just picked up the phone.

Jourdan and I married in 2007. She has supported me through the lawsuit and in my attempts to stay in touch with Lucy and Matilda. She is a hard working, independent woman and the love of my life. She is a wonderful mother to our twins, Isla and August who were born in 2011.

To have such cruel, blatant lies written about Jourdan and published around the world is devastating to us both. It is especially cruel for her as she lost her father suddenly a month ago.

I find it inexcusable that the media has published these exaggerations and falsehoods without even attempting to contact me for comment. The fact that it has been reprinted around the world by many publications and websites, and still no one has had the decency to contact me, forces me and Jourdan to pursue my legal rights against the media outlets who have published these stories.

This is entirely untrue and will keep going around in circles. He is a master strategist, narcissist and bully and I stand by my piece.
