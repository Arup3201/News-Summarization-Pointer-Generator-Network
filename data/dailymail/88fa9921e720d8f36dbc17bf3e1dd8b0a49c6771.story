Dave and Liv Tyler made their first official outing as a couple last week at a party for his best friend David Beckham 

Dave Gardner has a face that you might well recognise, but probably can't work out why. 

Since 2001, the eternally youthful football agent has been a permanent fixture in the background of celebrity photos - head down as the paparazzi jostle for pictures of his famous friends.

But despite his low-key public persona, the 38-year-old has had a central position in two of London's most important social circles for more than a decade; he is David Beckham's best friend and also a key member of Kate Moss's Primrose Hill posse. 

And now, Dave has managed to bag one of Hollywood's brightest beauties, the actress Liv Tyler, and the couple are expecting a child together.

So who is this man and how did he become one of London's most-connected men? 

It all started at the tender age of 14, when Dave joined the Manchester United Youth team. 

Even though the signing lasted for just five years, it was to eave a permanent impact on both his professional and love lives.

It was at Manchester United that Dave became close friends with Ryan Giggs and also a young David Beckham. 

Gardner and Beckham were both promising sportsmen who spent every evening on the football pitch and quickly became best friends. 

But while Beckham went on to join Giggs as one of the best players of his generation, Gardner struggled to keep up  and left the club in his late teens.

His time spent at the club wasn't wasted though - soon after he left, Dave set up the Elite Sports Agency with Six Alex Ferguson's son Jason, 

The pair's contacts meant they soon became two of the biggest football agents in the Premier League. 

After a few years, Dave decided to start up his own company, which is still going strong today.  

Despite the pair no longer training together, Dave Gardner's friendship with Beckham has stayed the test of time and he is one of two old friends the superstar credits with keeping his feet on the ground. 

He is David's eldest son Brooklyn's godfather and just last week he and Liv attended a party in the ex-England captain's honour in London.

Earlier this year, he was one of the friends the star invited join him on a 'find yourself' lads' holiday to Brazil. 

It was his friendship with Ryan Giggs that formed much of his personal life for the last decade though.

In Dave's early twenties, Ryan was dating his sister Emma, who he then dumped for the Hollyoaks actress Davinia Taylor. 

At the time, Dave was in a long-relationship with model Stacey Cooke and the couple were a permanent fixture on Manchester's social scene. 

But the relationship came to an abrupt end after Stacey left him for Ryan - the couple are still together to this day, despite revelations in recent years of Ryan's infidelity. 

A heartbroken Dave and Davinia - who is also heiress to a multi-million pound loo roll empire -  took solace in each other's company and it ended up being a match well-made as the pair eventually married in 2003.

David Beckham was best man at the £875,000 wedding, while Atomic Kitten singer Jenny Frost was a bridesmaid.

For the next few years, the couple were key components of the famous Notting Hill set - a group of well-known British stars including Sadie Frost, Jude Law, Meg Matthews, Sienna Miller and Rhys Ifans that centered around Kate Moss. 

In 2007, Davinia gave birth to their child - a son called Gray - and Kate Moss and David Beckham were named the godparents.

For a while, it seemed that the couple had it all, Dave lavished expensive gifts on his wife and the pair regularly took groups of friends on holiday to Davinia's father's yacht in the Mediterranean.

But gradually, Davinia's troubles with alcohol and bipolar disorder proved too difficult and cracks started to appear in the relationship - according to reports,he was often left at home looking after the child. 

The pair divorced in 2010, with Dave citing Davinia’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’ as the grounds for the split and he gained custody of their three-year-old son. 

The couple sold their home Supernova Heights for £3 million to the comedian David Walliams. 

For a while Dave made very few appearances on the showbiz circuit and was hesitant to return to the dating scene. 

A short-lived romance with Stephanie Dorrance, who was the ex-wife of the heir to the Campbell's soup business, reportedly ended because he felt she was too flash with her cash. 

Then in early 2013, Dave hit the headlines again after it was revealed that he was enjoying a relationship with the popstar Rita Ora, who was 15 years his junior.

The pair were spotted on numerous dates and Rita was pictured doing the 'walk of shame' early one morning from his London home in the same outfit she had worn the night before. 

But the relationship was once again just a brief spell and Rita moved on to her now ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris, while Dave allegedly enjoyed a short dalliance with Kelly Brook.

It was only in mid-July of this year that rumours first arose of his romance with Liv Tyler - the Hollywood actress and daughter of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler. 

Liv is no stranger to the British Isles - her previous husband and father of her first child is Leeds-born Royston Langdon from the band Spacehog.

It has been reported that Kate Moss conspired to set the pair up after becoming convinced they would hit it off.

The supermodel was right - they have now been together for several months and recently joined the supermodel and her husband Jamie Hince on a holiday to Spain. 

The pair are already playing happy families - Dave's son Gray has already met Liv's boy Milo numerous times. 

A source told The Sun newspaper: 'This is the real deal. Dave and Liv are madly in love. 

'They have a child the same age which is ideal. They're at a similar place in their lives and ready to settle down with the right person.'
