A size 22 woman who was told she was too fat to have a baby after five years of trying to fall pregnant was finally able to conceive naturally after losing seven stone.

Janette Pincott, 31, who suffers from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, and her husband Justin, 38, wanted nothing more than to become parents and applied for IVF.

However, Janette, of Croespenmaen, near Cardiff, was told that at 21 stone, she was too overweight to undergo the treatment, dashing the couple's hopes of ever having children.

Janette Pincott (pictured left with her husband Justin, and, right, after losing weight) was told that at 21st (left) she was too obese for IVF to be effective, so determined to have children she went on to lose 7st

Just six months after the birth of Charlie, pictured left, Janette discovered that she was pregnant with her second child Zachary who is now one-year-old, right

After hearing the devastating news, the mother-of-two made every effort to change her lifestyle, swapping greasy takeaways for fresh vegetables and soon started to lose weight. 

She also took up running, taking part in regular 5km runs.

Janette dropped six dress sizes and was a slim size 10 - and, against the odds, went on to conceive and give birth to two baby boys.  In February 2012 Janette gave birth to her first son Charlie, now two. Amazingly, six months later she fell pregnant again. Her son Zachary, now one, was born in April 2013.

Janette and Justin met each other on a night out in 2004, and, after a whirlwind eight-month romance, they bought a house together and made the decision to start trying for children.

'We spent five years trying, and it was just not happening. I was devastated,' Janette said.

Janette (pictured with Justin) suffers from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome meaning it was a struggle for her to achieve a child naturally, but Janette's weight meant she couldn't rely on medical help

'Every time I had to look at another failed pregnancy test I would cry - I was heartbroken. I wanted a child so badly, but I had no control over it.'

Anxious that her dreams of a large family would never be realised, Janette, who works in a call centre, turned to medics for help. 

But she was faced with further disappointment after she was told that at 21 stone she was too obese for the IVF to be effective.

Janette said that this was the final push she needed to finally start to lose weight.  

In 2011 after losing her first stone Janette was shocked to discover that she had fallen pregnant without the help of IVF. She is pictured here with her first child Charlie, now two

Janette said she knew she was overweight but she had never expected it to effect her ability to have a baby

'When I came back from the doctors, I looked at a photograph of myself and decided I needed to go on a diet.

'I knew I was overweight but I never thought it would stand in the way of me getting pregnant.

'Doctors were telling me I was overweight but I didn't realise how disgusting I looked until I saw a picture taken at a recent party.

'I thought "how on earth did I let myself get like that?" I knew I had to do something immediately if I was to have a child.'

Not only did her weight loss see her appearance dramatically change Janette was finally conceived the children she had always wanted.

In 2011, after losing her first four stone, Mrs Pincott was shocked to discover that she had fallen pregnant without the help of IVF treatment.

'I didn't expect the weight loss to help me conceive naturally, but I kept taking pregnancy tests every month in the hope we would strike gold,' she said.

'I locked myself in the bathroom and hoped for the best. When I saw that the test was positive I nearly fell off the toilet - I took ten pregnancy tests to make sure.

Breakfast: Janette would skip breakfast 

Lunch: Cheesey chips and gravy from a chip shop

Dinner: A large Dominoes pizza for dinner

Snacks: Chocolate muffins and crisps

Breakfast: Porridge 

Lunch: A whole wheat pasta and quorn salad

Dinner: A ham salad

Snacks: Janette snacks on fresh fruit throughout the day 

'Because I don't have periods I have to take a pregnancy test every month. Until I had my first scan at 12 weeks I didn't believe it.' 

Janette says that becoming pregnant once was a surprise enough and she was completely startled to find out she was expecting a second child. 

'The second pregnancy was an even bigger shock than the first. We'd spent all that time trying but I couldn't get pregnant - then when I lost the weight it happened naturally without the need for IVF at all.

'It's a miracle. The doctors said that me losing weight probably helped me to conceive naturally, so I'm very proud of what I achieved.

'Your weight can have an effect on your fertility - I lost weight and I think it helped me get pregnant.

'I was eating unhealthy food and I was eating massive portions - once I had my diet under control the weight fell off.'

Janette who now weighs 13st 5lbs, is determined not to slip back into bad habits and plans to take part in the Cardiff Half Marathon this year.
