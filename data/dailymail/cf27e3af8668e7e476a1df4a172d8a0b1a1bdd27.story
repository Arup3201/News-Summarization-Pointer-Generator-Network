A seaside ice cream shop is celebrating 85 years in business - despite serving only one flavour to customers since it opened in 1928.

A family code of honour has seen Notarianni's parlour in Blackpool serving homemade Italian vanilla through four generations - even turning down sums of up to £1million offered by corporate agents for the secret family recipe.

Despite competitors offering flavours like mint chocolate chip, pistacchio and Swiss chocolate, the parlour has vowed to keep its 'vanilla only' rule.

The shop was founded in 1928 by Luigi - 
an immigrant from southern Italy - and became a popular haunt thanks to 
his Italian-style ice cream.

Lugi's great-grandson Luca Vettese today serves the same ice cream from Notarianni Ices on the resort's seafront.

'There is an old saying, if something ain't broke don't fix it and it's true,' says Luca, 21, who runs the parlour with father Michael, 55.

'The recipe for our vanilla ice cream has been with with the family for generations and we would never disclose it to anyone else.

'We do have people coming in trying to buy it off us for anything up to a million pounds but we would never sell it for any price. The recipe has passed down from and it will be inherited by my children if I have any - and they will be sworn to secrecy too.

'There are
 only three of us alive who know the recipe, myself, my dad Michael and 
my grandad Guissippe. It's so good that it's not even written down.

'We joke to customers that we have to travel on separate airplanes in case anything happens and the recipe gets lost.'

Luigi died in 1972 aged 78 and it passed the business onto his daughter Luigina and her husband Guisseppe Vetesse in 1972.

They
 passed the business onto their son Michael in 1985 and Luca came into 
the business at the age of 16 in 2009. Luigina died last year aged 85 
whilst Guiseppe, now 87 lives in retirement in Great Yarmouth.

The shop sells up to 40 gallons of vanilla ice cream every day in the nine months of the year it is open.

Between March and up until the last day of the Blackpool Illuminations in November, customers can be seen queuing down the street.

'Grandad often rings to check up on us and check we are making the ice cream recipe correctly - but he trusts us with the recipe - he knows we will never defer from my great-grandad Luigi's recipe.

'We get old guys in their eighties coming in who remember my great-grandad and say the icecream reminds them of bygone times and takes them back to their childhood.

'We will never introduce any new flavours because vanilla is what we have been known for for generations.

'People say it is better than what you get in Italy. We serve it the old fashioned way too, we don't use scoops we use paddles.'

Luca will not reveal what makes their ice cream so successful, but says, the ice cream is freshly home-made using local milk, eggs and butter to create a creamy texture 'unlike any other'.

The parlour also sells Knickerbocker Glory, ice cream sundaes and its own version of an Eton Mess called Notties Mess.

'We're
 very proud of our ice cream and long may it carry on,' Luca adds. 'The 
pressure is on me to carry it on to the next generation.'
