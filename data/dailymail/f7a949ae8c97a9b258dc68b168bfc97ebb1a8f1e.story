This is the shocking moment when two teenage girls are launched from their scooter during a horrific road traffic collision in Ukraine. 

The footage was captured on a dash-mounted camera of a car waiting at a junction in Odessa, Ukraine. 

As the car waited at the lights, a white Citroen turns left, across the junction, but his forced to stop by pedestrians crossing the road. 

This is the moment the scooter carrying the two teenage girls ploughs into the Citroen in Odessa Ukraine

As the car pulls up to a halt, a scooter carrying two teenage girls comes shooting from the left of the screen, ploughing into the car's wing, launching the two girls into the air. 

Several pedestrians duck, as parts of the scooter are ripped from its body and scattered into the crowd. 

At the moment of impact, both girls are thrown head-first onto the car's bonnet, before cartwheeling and slamming into the ground, about 10 feet from the car. 

Two of the pedestrians are knocked over by the girls, neither of whom are wearing a helmet or any form of protective clothing. 

As the two pedestrians struggle to their feet, both girls remain immobile on the roadway as a third onlooker checks one of them for a pulse before running off.

Police investigating the case believe the Citroen's driver Nikita Ravgov, 53, caused the accident by pulling across the roadway. 

Both Artem Labrov, 16 and her passenger Yulia Zhalbova, 15, were seriously injured in the crash. 

Witness Yefim Sozonov, who filmed the incident on his dash-cam said: 'We were just waiting at the junction for the lights to change, then all of a sudden, wham.

'Both girls cartwheeled through the air and landed side by side on the road hitting some of the pedestrians as they were crossing the road. I thought they must be dead for sure.'

But a police spokesman said: 'Two young girls were seriously injured in the collision but are on the mend. The car driver is being interviewed.'

Her friend Yulia Zhalbova is also catapulted into the air, knocking over two pedestrians who were near the car
