A runaway cow caused traffic chaos when it escaped from its field and ran loose on a motorway, evading capture for nearly three hours.

It is the kind of sight you might expect to see on the streets of Pamplona but not on the fast lane of the A3, where motorists were stunned to witness the Highland cross heifer galloping along.

They called 999 but the animal continued its journey for five miles before the police finally brought its adventure to an end.

Moo-terway: The runaway cow, captured on camera by a shocked car passenger, caused havoc on the roads after it escaped onto a busy motorway and evaded capture for nearly three hours

The cow had escaped after being spooked, bolting out of its field in Farlington, near Portsmouth, charging through four fences, then onto a dual carriageway and then up a slip road onto the busy A3 (M) motorway.

Drivers faced miles of tailbacks as officers tried to coax the out-of-control cow, which weighed around 60 stone, off the road and to waiting park rangers.

Some worried motorists mistook the cow, with its large horns, for a raging bull and called the police.

Startled passengers took photographs of the cow, which was also captured on Highways Agency cameras.

Despite a two-and-a-half hour chase, the terrified animal was unable to be brought under control.

As it was headed towards a school where the children were about to emerge from classes, the call was made to humanely shoot the cow before the afternoonâ€™s rush-hour traffic kicked in, as she was deemed a danger to public safety.

The stretch of road was closed to traffic while the animal roamed free on the usually busy stretch of motorway

The cow was shot dead by a police firearms officer after she left the motorway near Crookhorn, Hampshire for a golf course fairway.

Russell Brown, animal rescue specialist for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'It was spooked, for whatever reason, and decided to run for it.

'Once they wind themselves up they can carry on and carry on.'

The decision was made to kill the cow after it left the motorway and traipsed onto the 10th fairway of Crookhorn Golf Club - which is close to three primary schools.

Mr Brown said: 'At that stage, because of conflicting reports, we were not sure if it was a Limousine bull.

'On advice from me, it was decided the best course of action would be to shoot it - to euthanise it.

'It was about 40 minutes from the three local schools packing up and it was a danger to human safety.

'Its temperament would not have allowed it to be easily corralled into a situation where it could have been calmed down.'

The police are responsible for dealing with animal when they are loose in a public space.

The RSPCA said shooting the animal on Tuesday was the most humane way of killing it to protect public safety.
