Zlatan Ibrahimovic could be heading back to Italy with a move to Serie A title challengers Roma, according to Corriere dello Sport.

Ibrahimovic, 33, has apparently grown 'tired' of playing in the French capital since signing for Paris Saint-Germain from AC Milan in the summer of 2012. 

Despite scoring 64 goals in 75 Ligue 1 appearances the striker has been rumoured to want a move back to the Serie A, although Roma are yet to make contact with the player.

'Convinced by the money', the Italian journal writes, the Swede was tempted to Paris by a lucrative deal with the four-time Ligue 1 champions worth around '€10million per year'.

Whether Roma are able to match those wages is not beyond the realms of possibility, and with Ibrahimovic willing to give up a 'good part' of his earnings to play somewhere that makes him happy, the rumours could materialise into something more concrete.

However, with Ibrahimovic turning 34 next year Rudi Garcia will need to seriously consider if he's worth the cash.

TuttoSport report that Juventus and Inter Milan will battle it out for the signatures of Xeridan Shaquiri and Ezquiel Lavezzi ahead of their Serie A clash on January 6.

Inter president Erick Thohir is said to be going his out of the way for the Swiss as his side also monitor Lavezzi's apparent fall out with PSG.
