Rupert Murdoch swooped in to Scotland today with just five days to go before the country's historic referendum on independence.

The media mogul toured Aberdeen, Fife and Glasgow, giving a wide berth to campaign sites with less than a week to go before Scots go to the polls.

The tycoon's visit comes days after he hinted at putting the support of his publications behind the Yes campaign.

Mr Murdoch, who owns The Sun and The Times, tweeted on Wednesday: 'Scots better people than to be dependants of London. Hard choice with real pain for some time. Maybe too much.

'Wrestling with Scottish vote. Scottish Sun No. 1. Head over heart, or just maybe both lead to same conclusion'.

He had previously described Alex Salmond as 'the best politician in the UK'. 

Today Mr Murdoch, whose media empire fell under unparalleled scrutiny during the Leveson Inquiry and subsequent phone hacking trial, is thought to have spoken with pub-goers about the coming referendum.

But, stopping for lunch in the Prince of Wales pub in Aberdeen, he side-stepped campaigners brandishing Yes or No placards to get into a waiting car.

This evening, the 83-year-old took to Twitter to share his experiences.

 'Tried 24 hours incognito Scottish visit (failed!) No politicians, just street and pub talks. Glasgow, Aberdeen, Rosehearty. Great people.'

When asked whether the pair had met during his flying visit, SNP leader Alex Salmond said: 'No, Mr Murdoch is quite entitled to be in Scotland, I've been campaigning today and I'm sure he's having a great time here in Scotland with the weather like the rest of us.'

In the event of independence, Mr Murdoch, whose grandfather Patrick John Murdoch emigrated from Aberdeenshire to Australia in 1884, could seek citizenship.  

But critics have been fast to accuse the tycoon of trying to influence Thursday's poll. 

Earlier this week Labour MP Tom Watson told MailOnline: 'Here we go again, Rupert Murdoch and his old friend Alex Salmond.

The tycoon gave a wide berth to political rallies and campaign talks instead opting to visit pubs and streets 

Earlier this week Murdoch hinted at his support of the Yes campaign in a series of tweets in which he referenced his ancestors

Earlier in the week the 83-year-old said he had tried to remain 'incognito' during this 24 hours in Scotland

Critics have accused Mr Murdoch of attempting to force his views on to his publications and influence the vote

'This is new politics just like the old politics. Murdoch is trying to dictate the agenda’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband meanwhile dismissed his Twitter remarks, suggesting the media tycoon does not want what is best for Scotland. 

Speaking at an event in Glasgow, Mr Miliband said: ‘As far as I know he doesn’t want a social democratic paradise.’  

Historically the tycoon's newspapers have put their full weight behind political campaigns during British general elections.
