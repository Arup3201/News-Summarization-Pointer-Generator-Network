Google is set to unveil a host of new products including a dramatic overhaul of its maps service and a possible music service its annual software developers' conference in San Francisco today.

Rumours suggest the company could be about to announce its latest operating system, an update to maps, Google Play Games, a music subscription service and more. 

At last year's event Google launched its Nexus 7 tablet and revealed Glass, its wearable computer.

Android 4.1 also known as Jelly Bean - the latest version of Google's Android operating system.

Nexus 7 -  the first tablet from Google. It had a 7-inch screen and ran Android Jelly Bean.

Google Now - a new search tool on Android, which has recently been introduced to desktops, that makes it easier to find information.

Google+ Events, and Google+ tablet apps for Android and iOS

Project Glass - the project behind Google Glass was demoed live during a skydive over San Francisco.

Google Docs - Offline support added, plus a Google Drive app for iOS. 

The I/O conference is due to start at 5pm GMT (9am PDT) and is expected to last for three hours. 

Much of the speculation about the conference has centered on a possible upgrade to the Nexus 7, the company's budget 7-inch Android tablet. 

A new version of the Nexus 7 is expected to have a faster processor and a higher resolution display screen.

Another Google-designed, Nexus handset is also a possibility, as is a handset from Google-owned Motorola.

There is also speculation that Google will unveil a music-streaming service that would mean Android users can to listen to their favourite songs and artists for a monthly fee.

Google has long been rumored to be in 
talks with music labels to work out the licensing rights for a service 
that would compete with Spotify, Rdio and other streaming services.

'It’s always good to see new companies and competition in the digital music space, and Google has a proven track record in bringing quality products to market. '

Commenting on the rumours, Ben Drury CEO at digital music store 7digital said: 'The rumoured service has a similar issue for consumers as other established players in the market – that it will likely be linked to one platform from one company, in this case Google’s Android OS/Play Music service.

'This approach is an outdated one for consumers, who are using more and more devices from multiple companies that are constantly connected to the internet.

Previously you had to install a plugin, or download the Google Earth software to see these images in a browser. This is one of a series of leaked screenshots discovered by Droid Forum

'Any new digital music service needs to be easily accessible across any device in order to be successful, and meet today’s consumer expectations.

'Having it tied to an Android handset is no good if someone decides to buy a Windows Phone or new Blackberry six months later.

'BlackBerry has shown how services tied to a specific device can falter in the longer term with the news [announced on Tuesday] BBM will now be available on other mobile platforms.

'Google’s service could go the same way in the longer term.

'While a subscription service may seem like the answer, once the user stops paying they lose access to their music, and their playlists and curation of music they’ve invested time in creating. Having a service that works across any device or platform is a much more attractive option.'

Google may be about to launch a digital gaming centre called Google Play Games. Leaked screenshots found by Android Police, the green controller icon will appear on your homescreen, left, and you can control notifications and view invitations in the Google Play Games Settings menu, pictured right

A sneak peak at the next generation of Android, code named 'Key Lime Pie', could be in the offing, too.

Google traditionally uses its I/O conference to launch new and updated versions of its Android operating system, so this is year is expected to be no exception.

Other potential products could include laptops running on Android or another Google operating system based on the company's Chrome web browser. 

Google also may provide more insights into the popularity of Google Plus, a social networking alternative to Facebook that launched nearly two years ago.

Google Plus had more than 135 million active users at the end of last year, based on Google's last public disclosure about activity on that network. 

That left Google Plus far behind Facebook, which boasts 1.1 billion active users. There have also been a number of apparent leaks hinting at a digital gaming centre called Google Play Games, and an update to Maps. 

Screengrabs discovered by Android Police suggest that Play Games is likely to let users play games on their devices and compete with other gamers. 

The drop-down menu on the grabs show  notifications and invitations options. 

DroidLife similarly found leaked screenshots from what is expected to be an overhaul of Google Maps. 

The shots show a Flight Search that helps you find flight directions, prices, and travel times. 

Earth View integrates Google Earth into the maps without the need for a plug-in. 

Google launched Google Music at the end of last year. It can scan and match songs from your PC, or you can buy music from the Play store. You can then play your tracks on any device with Google Music installed. At Google's I/O conference on Wednesday the company is expected to launch a music-streaming service to rival the likes of Spotify and Rdio. Rumours suggest that it has been in talks with record labels ahead of the announcement
