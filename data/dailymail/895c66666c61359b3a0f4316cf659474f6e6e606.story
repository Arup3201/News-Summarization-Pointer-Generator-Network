Pressure: Jeremy Hunt is facing renewed pressure as senior doctors are 'considering their position' at Lewisham Hospital in South-East London following plans to downgrade its casualty department

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt faces an unprecedented backlash from GPs who have threatened to quit executive roles over his controversial decision to downgrade a highly successful A&E unit.

In what would be the first walkout of its kind, senior GPs could resign over Mr Hunt’s decision last Thursday to disregard their views and turn Lewisham Hospital’s well-regarded casualty department – where 115,000 patients are treated every year – into ‘a tweaked urgent care centre’.

It means the most seriously ill patients will now be taken to other hospitals in a bid to divert  Government money from Lewisham, South-East London, to a neighbouring NHS Trust which is in danger of going bankrupt.

The Minister has refused to answer questions from The Mail on Sunday about his decision and has ‘gone away for the weekend with his family’, according to a spokeswoman.

Mr Hunt has also left behind confusion among doctors and managers as to which services will be left intact at Lewisham, and the threat of a judicial review over his decision.

Seven GPs on the executive board of the local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which represents 170 family doctors in the area, are now said to be ‘considering their position’ after claiming their overwhelming opposition to the proposals were ignored by the Minister.

Dr Helen Tattersfield, chairwoman of Lewisham CCG, said: ‘There’s a view that if we on the CCG board can’t influence something as important as this then how can we expect to influence anything? It’s a definite option for people, including me, to stand down.

fears: Residents and senior doctors have expressed concerns about the changes to the A&E, which treats 115,000 every year

'Mr Hunt has clearly ignored our position and we have not been listened to at any stage. 

‘He wouldn’t speak to us, but instead he was hearing from officials from NHS London and the Department of Health who are keen to produce this kind of result across the capital so were determined to make this work.’

Any resignations would prove highly embarrassing and potentially problematic for Mr Hunt because CCGs are set to take over responsibility for commissioning hospital services from Primary Care Trusts in April. 

Dr Tattersfield explained: ‘We’ll have an impossible task to control our own budget  because we can’t control where our patients will go for hospital treatment any more. I’ve been asked to do a task which is no longer possible. None of us on the board are prepared to lead an organisation into failure.’

Dr Helen Tattersfield, chairwoman of Lewisham Clinical Commissioning Group said: 'Mr Hunt has clearly ignored our position and we have not been listened to at any stage'

Campaigners and Lewisham Council have threatened to launch a judicial review of the decision, supported by Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham.

He said the doctors and residents of Lewisham had been ‘treated with contempt’.

A spokeswoman for Mr Hunt said it was ‘perfectly legal’ to alter services at the trust. She added: ‘The decision protects the clinical interests of patients in South-East London and helps relieve the burden of historic debt so money can be spent on high quality patient care.’
