Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson has refused to comment on a federal report published Wednesday which found racial bias in his department - with officers routinely discriminating against African-Americans by using excessive force.

The chief was asked about his future and that of his employees by CNN but would only say: 'I need to have time to really analyze this report so I can comment on it'. 

He avoided questions over whether he would step down but added he would 'take action where necessary'.

When questioned by a reporter about the damning Justice Department report which found racial profiling present in the Ferguson police department, Chief Tom Jackson was unable to give an answer  

Police Chief Thomas Jackson fields questions related to the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on August 13, 2014 in Ferguson. The police chief and his department have been widely criticized for their bungled response to teen's death which sparked national protests 

The Justice Department report  found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices in the St. Louis County suburb that has come to represent the tension between minorities and American police nationwide.

Most of Ferguson's police officers and top elected officials are white, but two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black. 

The report uncovered racist emails from three city employees, including some that belittled black residents or President Obama. 

All three employees responsible for those emails left their jobs on Thursday - it's not clear whether they were fired or resigned. 

However the Justice Department refused to prosecute white cop Darren Wilson who fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson on August 9, 2014.

The shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown led to protests in Ferguson, Missouri (pictured) and across the country over racial bias in the police 

A St. Louis County grand jury also found no evidence of a crime and announced in November that Wilson would face no state charges. 

President Obama  made his first remarks on the DOJ report on Friday saying the type of racial discrimination found in Ferguson, Missouri, is not unique to that police department, and he cast law enforcement reform as a chief struggle for today's civil rights movement.  

'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama told The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel. 

'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.'

Ferguson city leaders will meet with Justice Department officials in about two weeks and provide a plan for ways to improve the police department following the scathing report, Mayor James Knowles III said on Friday.

Knowles said that the goal is to work out an agreement with the federal government. A specific meeting date has not been set.

'They want to hear what we will do,' Knowles said. 'We're going to hopefully work out some sort of agreement and we'll move forward.

'We've got to come up with solutions now,' Knowles said.  

Knowles said city leaders were still going over the report 'line by line' before determining reforms. 

Asked about Police Chief Tom Jackson, Knowles said he still leads the police force, but the mayor declined to discuss Jackson's future. Further messages seeking comment from Jackson were not returned.

'I'm not here to just chop heads,' Knowles said. 'We have to evaluate everything in the report, pick out what are the systemic issues and what are the things we can fix.' 

The mayor said he first learned of the emails on Wednesday after meeting with Justice officials in St. Louis. He said he was so incensed that he ordered the accounts of all three employees disabled while he was in the car returning to Ferguson after the meeting.

Knowles said there was no evidence that Jackson or other police administrators were aware of those emails.
