An elderly husband strangled his 79-year-old wife to death before taking his own life, police believe.

The body of pensioner Edith Gravener, who suffered from dementia, was found inside her home in St Helens, Merseyside, by her daughter-in-law last Tuesday.

After officers were called, a search for her missing husband Ronald resulted in the 78-year-old's body being found in Carr Mill Dam, less than a mile from the couple's property, just hours later.

Post mortem examinations showed that Mrs Gravener, a retired seamstress, died as a result of asphyxiation and Mr Gravener, a retired coal miner, of drowning.

Edith Gravener, 79, was found dead at her home in Mallory Grove in the St Helens area of Merseyside (pictured), and her husband Ronald, 78, was found dead just a few hours later at a dam less than a mile away

Police confirmed that they believe Mr Gravener strangled his wife before committing suicide.

A criminal investigation is now underway, with a file set to be prepared for the coroner.

Stunned neighbours living in the sleepy cul-de-sac told of their shock after the bodies of the elderly couple were discovered just hours apart.

One said: 'They had lived here for 20-plus years and were a really lovely couple.

'She suffered from dementia but he was totally devoted to her and cared for her around the clock.

'We used to see him going up the road to get his paper every morning.

'It's terrible what's happened. We've lived here for 30 years and nothing like this has ever happened around here before.'

Another told how the first he knew of the tragedy was when police knocked on his door and told him that Mrs Gravener had been found dead and that Mr Gravener and his car had disappeared.

He added: 'Whichever way you look at it, it's a tragedy.'

Inquests into both deaths were opened on Monday afternoon.

In the opening statements, it was revealed that Mrs Gravener's daughter-in-law, Amanda, had arrived at the house shortly after 9am on December 2 to take Mrs Gravener to see her GP, but had found the couple's property unlocked.

Inside, she discovered Mrs Gravener's body and a note, penned by Mr Gravener, in which he allegedly apologised for his actions.

A subsequent police search resulted in officers finding Mr Gravener's body in Carr Mill Dam shortly before 1pm.

Police said an investigation into both deaths was 'ongoing' but detectives confirmed that they were not seeking anyone else in relation to either death.
