It looks like Leonard Lauder, the 80-year-old billionaire chairman of the cosmetics giant Estee Lauder, is officially back on the singles’ market.

The wealthy octogenarian was due to marry his girlfriend Linda E. Johnson, 55, this past August, but the couple scrapped the planned nuptials just days before saying 'I do.'

However, the two continued to be seen in public together and even went ahead with their trip to Sardinia, which was supposed to be their honeymoon.

They're history: Leonard Lauder, the 80-year-old chairman of Estee Lauder, and his former fiancee Linda E. Johnson, pictured here in September, wrote in an email to friends that they decided to go their separate ways

On Tuesday, New York Post's gossip column Page Six reported that Lauder and Johnson sent their mutual friends a joint email announcing their split.

'We are afraid that we must cancel Sunday’s holiday party,' the missive cited by the Post read. 'Sadly, we have made the difficult but mutual decision to go our separate ways.

'We will remain friends and certainly cherish the time we spent together. We are so very sorry for the inconvenience and send you our warmest wishes... Best, Linda and Leonard.'

Estee Lauder spokesperson Bari Seiden confirmed the separation to MailOnline in an email this afternoon. 

Mr Lauder is the firstborn son of Estee Lauder, who in 1935 co-founded a company along with her husband selling beauty products. His estimated net worth is currently $7.6billion, according to Forbes.

Miss Johnson, a glamorous Philadelphia socialite and art collector, has been the president and CEO of Brooklyn Public Library since 2011.

Lauder and Johnson were set to walk down the aisle in late August, but the intimate Philadelphia ceremony was called off at the last moment after the couple decided things were moving too fast.

The couple had begun publicly dating in late 2012, just a year after Lauder had tragically lost his first wife Evelyn to ovarian cancer. They had been married for 52 years and had helped grow the family business together.

Lauder and Johnson were pictured attending several New York society events together last year and spent last New Year's Eve at the Metropolitan Opera Gala.

In May, it was revealed that the couple were very happy and talking about marriage, news that caused much distress among aspiring socialites 'of a certain age'. 

Launder, the chairman emeritus of Estée Lauder Co., has been described as ‘New York’s most eligible bachelor.’

The couple had been planning to wed in Philadelphia in front of a small group of family and friends in the last week of August.

But the New York Post reported at the time that the couple had started calling guests just a few weeks prior to tell them that their big day was being ‘postponed.’

In late September, Lauder and Johnson were all smiles at the Metropolitan Opera's season opening production of Eugene Onegin. Then in October, the couple were photographed warmly embracing at the Whitney Gala.

Leonard and Evelyn Lauder married in 1959 and had two sons together. She had also worked at the cosmetics giant and was especially famous for spearheading the Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Pink Ribbon initiative.

Johnson, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, studied law. According to her Brooklyn Public Library biography, she was formerly CEO of the National Constitution Center and collects contemporary art, contemporary craft and early American folk art.

Leonard Lauder is uncle to Aerin and Jane Lauder, who both work for the family business too. Aerin is described as a 'modern-day ambassador' for the brand, while Jane has been global president/general manager of the Origins and Ojon brands since July 2010.
