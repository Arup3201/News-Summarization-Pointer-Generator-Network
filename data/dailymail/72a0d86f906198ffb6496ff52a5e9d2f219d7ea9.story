Greek political leaders were locked in talks this evening as they bid to hammer out a historic power-sharing deal to secure a 130billion euro bailout package.

Outgoing Prime Minister George Papandreou and his opposite number Antonis Samara held fresh negotiations by telephone hours after reaching the agreement to form a coalition government.

The new government’s first job will be to the passing of the latest bailout, agreed on October 27, before holding elections.

Papandreou, who could resign later this evening, also spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders.

The leaders were said to be wary of the latest announcement from Athens.

Mrs Merkel’s spokesman Steffen 
Seibert said: ‘Europe, and the German government too, must be able to 
see that the Greeks are serious, that it is not just about announcements
 but about actions.’

And French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe added: ‘Things are heading in the right direction... but what's 
important is that the bailout plan for Greece gets ratified.’

Europe's markets also remained 
cautious that the power deal would resolve the country's political 
turmoil and alleviate concerns over Greece's membership of the euro.

Former European Central Bank vice 
president Lucas Papademos, 64, is being tipped as the most likely new 
head of the government that would serve until a February 19 general 
election.

He will step in after Athens gave in to EU demands to install a coalition government of ‘national salvation’ last night.

All European markets opened sharply lower today, though shares on the stock exchange in Athens were trading around 2 per cent higher.

The interim government is expected to 
be in place for three to four months to ensure a new European debt deal 
and secure a vital instalment of bailout loans that Greece needs to 
avoid default.

A member of Mr Papandreou’s Pasok 
party, Telemachos Hitiris, had warned: ‘Everything must be done within 
the day, otherwise tomorrow it will be hell.’

The EU has been accused of carrying 
out a coup d’etat in Greece, after the head of the European Commission 
threatened the country with ‘paralysis’ unless MPs removed their prime 
minister.

Jose Manuel Barroso, the EC 
president, had warned that Greece would not get its next payment from 
the EU and International Monetary Fund unless Mr Papandreou was toppled.

EU leaders were horrified that Mr 
Papandreou said a referendum should be held to approve a 100billion euro
 bailout deal, which will result in a decade of tax rises and spending 
cuts.

German politician Peter Altmaier 
insisted that Greece’s future in the eurozone would depend on the 
implementation of long-term economic reforms.

‘We have made it clear we want to 
preserve the euro,’ the deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela
 Merkel’s Christian Democrats said. ‘At the final stage, it depends what
 happens inside Greece.’

Meanwhile, Joachim Fels, of Morgan 
Stanley Research, warned that the admission by EU leaders that countries
 could leave out of the eurozone threatened even more turmoil.

‘Chancellor Merkel and [French 
president Nicolas] Sarkozy, in response to the idea of a Greek 
referendum on the bailout package, raised the possibility of a country 
leaving the euro – so far a taboo in European political circles,’ he 
said in a note to investors.

‘By raising the possibility that a 
country might leave the euro, core European governments may have set in 
motion a sequence of events which could potentially lead to runs on 
sovereigns and banks in peripheral countries that make everything we 
have seen so far in this crisis look benign.’

Now that one stricken eurozone leader 
has been ousted, EU officials are said to be seeking Silvio Berlusconi’s
 head amid mounting concerns over his country’s failure to get to grips 
with its huge debts.

Yves Mersch, a member of the ECB’s 
governing council, warned yesterday that it may stop buying Italy’s debt
 if its government  does not adopt promised finan- cial reforms.

‘Our job is not to remedy the errors 
of politicians,’ he said. The head of the International Monetary Fund, 
Christine Lagarde, has claimed that Italy’s plans to reduce its debts 
‘lack credibility’.

Mr Berlusconi yesterday insisted he 
had enough support to continue as leader, even as 20 government MPs 
threatened to break ranks in a key vote on the country’s budget.

Turmoil: Greece's government is in chaos as it tries to create a coalition

One newspaper, Corriere della Sera, 
compared the atmosphere in his People of Freedom Party to ‘the end of 
Pompeii’, but despite the rebellion Mr Berlusconi insisted: ‘I have 
checked the numbers, and even with the defections we still have a 
majority in parliament.’

Insiders said that the billionaire 
media tycoon spent the weekend speaking to rebels and waiverers, urging 
them to back him in the crucial vote – despite having labelled  them 
‘traitors’.

Many believe Mr Berlusconi is spending
 too much time focusing on his four ongoing trials, including one 
relating to sex with an underage prostitute, instead of trying to 
resolve the situation in the eurozone’s third-largest economy.

The Italian premier is widely seen as 
incapable of saving Italy from economic meltdown, with the country’s 
public debt standing at 1.9trillion euros – the equivalent of 120 per 
cent of GDP.
