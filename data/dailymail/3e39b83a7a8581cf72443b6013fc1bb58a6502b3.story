Elusive: A 'Himalayan yeti (as imagined by an artist:

It has remained abominably elusive. But the hunt for the yeti is about to take a big footstep forward.

A major yeti expedition is being planned after genetic analysis of two Himalayan hair samples showed they come from no known living  creature.

Instead, they were an exact match to an extinct species of polar bear.

Oxford University researcher Bryan Sykes, a respected human geneticist, says that a creature very similar to it is ‘almost certainly’ still roaming the Himalayas – and TV company Icon Films is so convinced that it is organising an expedition to go and find it.

Professor Sykes said: ‘There may well be a yeti.’

In
 the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 
years, Professor Sykes used a technique used by the FBI to catch 
criminals to read the DNA of 30 samples of hair.

The
 hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis or their bigfoot cousins and 
were part of museum and private collections around the world.

Twenty
 eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to 
racoons, horses and cows. But two didn’t fit the mould.  

Their
 DNA matched that recovered from a 40,000-year-old polar bear fossil, 
the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reports.

One hair was reddish brown and found in a ‘yeti nest’ in a bamboo forest in Bhutan ten years ago.

The second was golden brown and taken from a ‘yeti’ Ladakh on the Tibet-India border 40 years ago.

The hunter described the creature as very aggressive and noticeably different to the bears with which he was very familiar.

Professor Sykes said: ‘They are almost certainly still there and the next step is to find one.

‘They are either really a polar bear of a different sort to the usual polar bears or they are a hybrid with brown bears.’

He
 added that the polar bear is the only type of bear to deliberately hunt
 humans.  If the yeti is a polar bear relative, this could explain why 
it has such a terrifying reputation.

A TV company is now planning a yeti-hunting expedition to the Himalayas.

Professor Sykes said: ‘If they find one, they need to get some tissue to do genetic analysis.  They also need to watch how it behaves and that might help explain why people thought they were yetis.’

The biggest yeti hunt was sponsored by the Daily Mail and took place 60 years ago in 1954.

The 600-strong expedition failed to snare the mythical beast but did find footprints and hairs.

Professor Sykes said: ‘All of that has been lost but no one had the methods then to show what they had, unlike now.’

Professor Norman MacLeod, a fossil expert and evolutionary biologist from the National History Museum, said the DNA technique used in the study could be used to verify other hair samples.

He said: ‘Will this ultimately lead to the recognition of new large mammalian species in out-of-the-way corners of the world?

‘No one – certainly no scientist – can know for sure.

‘What we do know is that scientific discoveries just as strange and unexpected…have happened before.’
