Lara Logan of CBS News is being quarantined in a South Africa hotel for three weeks as a precaution after visiting an American-run hospital treating Ebola patients in Liberia for a '60 Minutes' report that aired Sunday.

CBS said Monday that Logan's 21-day self-quarantine will end this Friday. Neither Logan nor the four other CBS employees in South Africa have shown any sign that they are infected with the virus.

Logan, speaking in a '60 Minutes Overtime' web interview from the room where the CBS crew put its report together, admitted to some cabin fever as she waits out her stay. She said the South African government had given the crew permission to work at the hotel.

Quarantined: CBS News reporter Lara Logan is spending 21 days in quarantine, following a visit to an American-run hospital treating Ebola patients in Liberia 

Holed up: Logan, seen with Geoff Mabberley, who helped her team steer clear of the Ebola virus, admitted to experiencing cabin fever 

Contained: A preview of Logan's report from Liberia showed her at the hospital speaking with doctors. Shoes are hung upside down and dried as a cleaning precaution 

'We wanted to try, as much as possible, to minimize our exposure to anybody while we still had to get our piece done,' she said. 'We were very mindful of the fact that this 21-day period after you've been in an Ebola-affected country is very important to everyone.'

The interview showed Logan and CBS security worker Geoff Mabberley in a room stuffed with equipment. 'We haven't traveled far from the room that you can see,' she said.

The '60 Minutes' report detailed her precautions while in Liberia, including being hosed down with a chlorine solution, having her temperature taken frequently and making sure not to touch people. 

Explaining the context behind an Ebola quarantine, Logan said in the '60 Minutes Overtime' interview that 'the scientists and the doctors that we spoke to said that the real quarantine period for Ebola is actually ten days. 

'So, when they look at the 21 days, what they're actually looking at is two ten-day periods where, of quarantine or of not showing any symptoms other than Ebola, and then an extra day added for security because the latest that the disease ever showed in animals was within that period.'  

Mabberley traveled with the crew with the responsibility of watching everyone's interactions to minimize any chance they could be infected.

Speaking about Mabberley, Logan said during the interview 'Geoff just watched us every minute of the day, and sprayed us with chlorine and disinfected everything - the drivers, the cars, the luggage - every time you got out, came out of somewhere.'

'I'm just constantly looking at what they're touching, where they're going, where they're standing, where they're moving to, to try and preempt the next move, try and protect them from that next move,' Mabberley said in the interview. 'And it is difficult.'  

Back at work: It was Logan's second '60 Minutes' story since her return from a forced leave of absence after questions were raised about her role in a disputed story on the deadly 2012 raid at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya

A cameraman who was working for NBC News in Liberia contracted the virus but recovered last month. Nancy Snyderman, the NBC News medical correspondent who worked there, was asked to go into voluntary quarantine when she arrived home but that was made mandatory after she was spotted leaving her home. ABC's Richard Besser was not quarantined upon his return from Liberia because the ABC team was judged not to have had exposure to the virus.

Logan briefly teared up when talking about William, a 5-year-old boy featured in her report who was cared for in the hospital by his father but who later died. She said she has a son the same age.

'It's so heartbreaking,' she said in the interview. 'It's really been hard on all of us, not just on me. And the scale of this tragedy and the brutality of this virus, the way it tears through families, and all the children.

'There are so many children. And so, you know, such little children. Of course that's - that's also one of the things that tears at your heart. And they're young children in these wards who have nobody to care for them.' 

She also revealed in the interview that 'On the grave markers, instead of writing, "Born and died," the way you would in the U.S., the Liberians write, "Sunrise and sunset" to mark a person's time on the earth. 

'And that, for us, was symbolic of the spirit of the people that really moved us.' 

It was Logan's second '60 Minutes' story aired since her return from a forced leave of absence after questions were raised about her role in a disputed story on the deadly 2012 raid at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.
