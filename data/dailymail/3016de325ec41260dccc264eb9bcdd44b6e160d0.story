Robert Ekaireb, who is accused of murdering his pregnant wife Li Hua Cao, arriving at the Old Bailey

A 'paranoid' millionaire accused of murdering his pregnant wife did not to tell police about bank statements 'proving' she was alive for five years, the Old Bailey heard today.

The jury heard the 'paranoid' 38-year-old, who suffered from OCD and depression, claimed the letters were proof his missing wife Li Hua Cao was still alive.

But he claims he failed to hand them over to police, because he did not like the detective in charge of the investigation.

The 38-year-old allegedly murdered his wife when he flew into a jealous rage at their home in Hampstead, north London.

He wanted Li Hua to take a lie detector test to prove the paternity of her unborn baby.

The property developer spent the night at a nightclub in Londonâ€™s West End after she vanished, before arranging for their luxury flat to be be redecorated, professionally cleaned and recarpeted the next day.

Ekaireb claims that she had packed her 
bags and left him for a better life - but she has not been seen alive 
since October 23, 2006.

The couple moved into at a luxury one-bed apartment at Pavilion Court in the Mount Vernon complex, a private gated community in Hampstead, north London, at the beginning of August 2006, the court heard.

Despite only living there for three months, Ekarieb allegedly undertook extensive cleaning and decorating, even hiring professional marble cleaners to ensure the flat was spotless.

He also fitted new cream carpets which were identical to the original ones - and then could not remember doing it, the jury were told.

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'When he was asked by the police about work done to the apartment, although saying he recalled he had the place professionally cleaned as a condition of the letting he claimed to have completely forgotten about the re-carpeting and he flatly denied having any other work done to the flat.'

The carpets were so similar, that the
 previous owner was not able to distinguish any difference from 
photographs shown to him by the police.

It emerged Ekaireb also owned a three-bedroom apartment on the same gated estate.

He
 had lived there with his Slovakian ex-lover Martina Kamenistiakova 
before abandoning the property when their relationship ended.

Pavilion Court in Hampstead, where the couple shared a one-bedroom flat. The Old Bailey heard Ekarieb had the flat completely re-carpeted and re-decorated in the months after his pregnant wife disappeared

'Gainsborough House was kept locked by him and resembled a time capsule when police entered it six years later, rather than a shrine to a lost romance,' said Mr Altman.

When police first entered that property in February last year the apartment, which had not been rented out for years, was 'in a state of deep freeze', the prosecutor explained.

'They found the place as it was when the defendant had last left it, even to the point of items of food being left uneaten or half-eaten,' he said.

'And although the defendant had provided the security men on the estate with the keys for all the properties, they never had the keys for Gainsborough House.'

Li Hua's family had made contact with that address after her disappearance believing she was living there.

'We know the defendant had access to two apartments in two blocks for his own private purposes,' said Mr Altman.

Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007

'If he killed her it took place in private where there were no eye witnesses and no one to tell tales.'

After his wife's disappearance, Ekaireb kept computer generated bank letters as 'dynamite' proof she was still alive.

He only handed the letters from HSBC to the police five years after Li Hua went missing, it was said.

Mr
 Altman said the letters were sent to Gainsborough House 'a few weeks
 after she had disappeared' from her bank advising her they were going 
to close her account as they mistakenly believed the Chinese passport 
she used to set up the account had expired.

'He thought it was dynamite - showing 'my wife is alive and well',' said Mr Altman.

Ekaireb
 said he did not hand in the letters because he disliked a detective 
working on the investigation, claiming he was 'obstructive and 
unhelpful'.

But Mr Altman dismissed this as 'a lame excuse'.

But
 when Li Hua visited him in London on a tourist visa, he did not allow 
her to sleep at Gainsborough House because 'to him that didn't feel 
right'.

It was said that Li Hua's principal ambition was to marry a wealthy man who could support a lavish lifestyle and send money to her family in China.

The couple met at the lapdancing club where Li Hua was working in Ireland in late 2005.

They married on October 4, 2006, by which time the 27-year-pld was already pregnant.

But Li Hua had become disillusioned with her marriage and the 'superficiality of her married existence' and repeatedly attempted to leave Ekaireb who was growing paranoid and jealous.

Ekaireb was so paranoid about his wife cheating on him that he tried to hire a private investigator and set up a lie detector test, the court heard.

He made an appointment for a test at 3pm on October 9, 2006 but either cancelled or did not turn up, it is claimed.

On 28 August Ekaireb assaulted Li Hua in public after an argument on the way home from a restaurant, the jury were told.

A passer-by called police and officers found Li Hua in East Finchley Food and Wine with cuts and grazes to both arms.

She claimed that Ekaireb pushed her to the ground after they rowed about her past and him smoking in the car while she was pregnant.

Li Hua told her sister that Ekaireb's father Rex had persuaded her to withdraw her allegation of assault, jurors heard.

Ekaireb told police that Li Hua fell over after kicking him.

Li Hau was 22 weeks pregnant when she 'simply vanished' on Monday 23 October 2006, jurors were told and no record of a birth has been discovered.

Phone records show that Li Hau contacted her brother Li Bin Cao in Denmark earlier that day but never contacted him or her family in China again.

Ekaireb allegedly arrived back at Pavilion Court at 11.07pm and at 11.44pm he rang his parents' home.

He then phoned the manager's office at Club Tantra nightclub at around 1am before heading there in the early hours. That was the last phone call ever made from the flat, the court heard.

He also made no attempts to track down his wife or report her disappearance to police, the court heard.

Li Hau was finally reported missing by her brother in February 2007 but no evidence has been found that she is alive.

In 2010 the investigation being taken over by a team from the Specialist Crime Directorate of the Metropolitan Police.

The court heard Ekaireb was too embarrassed about meeting Li Hua at the lap-dancing club in Cork to introduce her to his mother.

'He did not want to lie to his mother about the circumstances in which they met,' Mr Altman said.

They married in a Chinese wedding ceremony after Ekaireb gave her a wedding ring which he claimed was worth Â£10,000.

But he looked down on her family, who originated from a fishing village.

He reportedly said:'They had no sign of money, no sign of finesse, no sign of class'.

Ekaireb, of Corrigan Close, Hendon, northwest London, denies murder.

The trial continues.
