There is something about black and white photography that can instantly transport you back in time.

Their subjects often appear shrouded in mystery, with grey shading making them appear part of a shadowy world very different to the one we live in today.

Now a group of artists have begun drawing the dark veil back from these figures, to bring them out of the murky past and into vivid reality. 

Digital artists are reviving the lost art of photo colourisation, which has been around for more than 175 years. Pictured is 'The March on Washington' that took place on 28 August 1963 in Washington D.C. as part of  civil rights movement. Here Martin Luther King gave his famous 'I have a Dream' speech

The artists, many of which have become popular on Reddit threads, are reviving the lost art of photo colourisation, which has been around for more than 175 years.

'Many people don't know that colour photography dates as far back as the craft of photography itself,' said Mads Madsen a student from Denmark, who runs the popular Colourised History subreddit.

'We're not trained to recognise objects in black and white, but seeing these images in colour completely negates that and we're suddenly able to connect with that photograph.

'We feel as if we're there with those people, experiencing it.'

From the moment the first photo was taken by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826, photographers began experimenting with ways to try and bring true-to-life colour into the frame.

It was in 1839 that the world's first publically announced photographic process, the daguerreotype, began coming into widespread use, according to Italy-based printing firm, Pixartprinting.

Then, in 1861, the first colour photo made its debut by James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish mathematical physicist, when he snapped a photo of a tartan ribbon.

Meanwhile, in Japan a photographer named Yokoyama Matsusaburō used his training as a painter and lithographer to create shashin abura-e or 'photographic oil paintings'.

The process involved cut cutting away the paper support of the photo and applying pigment to the emulsion with a drying oil, claims Pixatrprinting.

Today, while oil paintings, dyes and watercolours are still used to bring black and white images to life, technology allow more accurate ways of recapturing colour.

'Most of us use Photoshop - I use CS6 with a Wacom Bamboo tablet. That being said, there are many examples of people using Gimp, or Paint.net - whatever you use, it's all about the technique, rather than the program,' said artist Mads Madsen. 

'I liken colourisation to the game of Chess. Simple to pick up but extremely difficult to master and I have a very long way to go,' added artist Jordan Lloyd when speaking with Pixartprinting.

'The basic formula in its variations is straightforward: just keep adding layers of colour onto the black and white image, and mask it off 'between the lines'. That's it. The more colour variation you add, the more 'real' the final image is perceived to a point (then you're hitting diminishing returns).' 

'Most of us use Photoshop,' said Mr Madsen told the printing firm, who carried out extensive interviews with the artists.

The artists use the software to add layers of colour onto the black and white image, and blend the colours between the lines.

But part of it is guesswork. 'You make educated guesses much of the time, but those guesses are informed by a laborious level of research into the visual and historical context of the photograph,' said Jordan Lloyd is a colour restoration expert who works for Dynamichrome.

'If people find this pretentious or overkill, then they're missing the point, because Winston Churchill wasn't ever photographed wearing a bright purple jacket.'

Not everyone is convinced that colourising the history is a worthwhile endeavour.

Despite the historical research put in, some claim it's an insult to history as artists can never really know the true colour photographed.

Despite the dissenters, many artists claim they've also received positive feedback from those who are able to appreciate the photos in a new and personal way.

'People are enamoured with well colourised image because it makes an abstract concept, 'the bygone era in black and white', and renders it into a concept we all understand: well defined colour,' said Wayne Degan who blogs at Metacolor.org.

'I've heard my own work described as a 'visceral experience' or 'relatable'. As one colouriser put it on his website, 'we don't live in a black and white world, neither did they'.'
