A bitter Coalition row over spending cuts escalated today, as David Cameron claimed the Lib Dems are 'all over the place' on how to tackle the deficit.

The Prime Minister joined the war of words as Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the Tories want to 'inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain' and are no longer 'economically credible'.

Together with George Osborne and Nick Clegg clashing yesterday, it means the four most senior figures in the Coalition are now at odds about how to repair the nation's finances.

Prime Minister David Cameron claimed the Lib Dems were 'all over the place' while Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander accused the Tories of wanting to 'inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain'

Chancellor George Osborne and his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander, pictured leaving the Treasury last week, have clashed over how to tackle the deficit

Tensions in the coalition have mounted in the wake of Mr Osborne's mini-Budget, in which he overhauled stamp duty and targeted non-doms and foreign firms for tax rises, but also admitted dramatic spending cuts were still needed to balance the books.

The Lib Dems sought to insist scrapping the 'slab' system of stamp duty had been their policy since 2007, while also claiming credit for increasing the income tax personal allowance to £10,600.

Both parties signed up to billions of pounds in spending on roads, housing and flood defences.

But the prospect of huge spending cuts to eradicate a deficit of £91billion has caused bitter divisions.

The Tories say the money can be found entirely through spending cuts, with welfare bearing the brunt.

But the Lib Dems argue a fifth of the money can be raise through extra taxes, including a mansion tax on £2million homes.

Mr Alexander during the growing row with a claim that the Tories are gripped by 'pre-election panic', resorting to 'pandering to Ukip' and pursuing a policy of 'austerity for ever'.

The Chief Secretary to the Treasury was last week the only senior Lib Dem to publicly back the Chancellor's spending measures in the Autumn Statement. 

The Tories are  furious that Vince Cable hailed the Autumn Statement as 'excellent' in a meeting for the Cabinet before criticising it in public.

But writing in the Telegraph, Mr Alexander added to the criticism of the Conservatives. He said: 'The Liberal Democrat approach is to stay the course we've set in this Parliament until the job is complete in 2017-18.

'It is sad to see the Conservatives move away from the sensible, balanced approach of the Coalition, to a more doctrinaire policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain.

'A mix of unfunded tax promises, harsh spending plans and pandering to Ukip may be born of pre-election panic, but it is not economically credible.' 

Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the Tories had to 'come clean' about the impact of trying to eradicate the deficit from spending cuts alone

David Cameron: 'The Liberal Democrats are all over the place, unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it.'

George Osborne: 'The battle lines for the general election have been drawn this week. There's a clear choice: a competent plan to stay on course to prosperity with us or a return to economic chaos with all the alternatives. It's hard to work out exactly what they (the Lib Dems) think. While they sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts. 

'But they shouldn't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone. If you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting, you'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance.'

Nick Clegg: 'The Conservatives are kidding themselves and seeking to kid British voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books, deliver unfunded tax cuts, shrink the state and support public services in the way that everybody wants – it just doesn't add up. The Conservatives now need to come clean.'

Danny Alexander: 'It is sad to see the Conservatives move away from the sensible, balanced approach of the Coalition, to a more doctrinaire policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain. 

'A mix of unfunded tax promises, harsh spending plans and pandering to Ukip may be born of pre-election panic, but it is not economically credible.'

The PM waded into the row, using a letter to all Tory MPs to launch a sustained attack on the Lib Dems.

Mr Cameron said their coalition partners were 'unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it'.

Mr Cameron dubbed last week's Autumn Statement as 'distinctly Conservative' because it overhauled stamp duty and supported business and said voters face a clear choice 'between competence and chaos'.

He wrote: 'All Labour offer is more of the same: more spending, more borrowing, more taxes, more debt … the Liberal Democrats are all over the place, unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it.'

Chancellor Mr Osborne also defended his blueprint today. He told the BBC: 'We are going to have to make savings... we are going to have to cut certain welfare bills like benefits that go to working-age people.

'But the prize is economic stability, growth, jobs in the future, brighter future, I think that's a price that works for our country.'

It was the Lib Dems that were 'offering ... a chaotic alternative of higher taxes, higher borrowing and a return to economic chaos' that would take Britain 'back to square one', he suggested.

Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts

Yesterday Mr Osborne insisted the measure would do little to balance the books and the Lib Dems would have to use other hikes to make up the shortfall.

'It's hard to work out exactly what they (the Lib Dems) think,' Mr Osborne wrote in The Sunday Times.

'While they sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts.

'But they shouldn't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone.

'If you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting, you'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance.'

Mr Clegg responded by saying the Tories were 'kidding themselves' and voters over the 'huge' scale of cuts they would impose if they won the election.

The Deputy Prime Minister also hit back at claims by Chancellor George Osborne that the Lib Dems would wreak 'economic chaos', and said the Tories would have to 'hack back' education and other services if they were to eliminate the deficit without putting up taxes.

On BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Clegg said: 'I think the Conservatives are kidding themselves and seeking to kid British voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books, deliver unfunded tax cuts, shrink the state and support public services in the way that everybody wants.'

Mr Osborne said a Tory government would save billions on welfare, with initiatives such as restricting child benefit to the first two children in a family. He told the Sunday Times: 'While [the Lib Dems] sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts.'
