Every mobile phone user in Pakistan is being ordered to have their fingerpints taken as part of the country's tough new anti-terror laws.

Every citizen who wants to use a device must make sure their name, phone number and finger prints are on record in order to keep their SIM card.

Since the new measure was announced earlier this year, Pakistanis have been lining up at mobile phone stores and in front of vans and kiosks to have their fingerprints scanned so their identities can be verified, meaning they can keep their phones.

The measures are meant to tighten control of mobile phones and stop them being used in terror attacks following a Taliban massacre at a school in Peshawar two months ago, which left 150 dead.

For user to keep their phones, they have to go to a kiosk and show their ID while having their fingerprints scanned.

If the fingerprint matches up with one on a government database, they are allowed to keep their SIM card. If not, their service is cut off.

Last year, the Pakistani government introduced biometric machines designed to check users' identities - making the check mandatory for anyone who wants to get a new SIM card.

But in the wake of the Peshawar attack, they're now checking all users, regardless of when they got their SIM card, to make sure those who have been issued with one, are actually the ones using it.

The project has been portrayed as a way to curb the use of cellphones by militants and criminals in planning or carrying out attacks.

In explaining the measure, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told lawmakers earlier this month that he was sure the terrorists 'will lose a big weapon.'

A police official investigating the Peshawar attack said at least two of the SIM cards recovered from the scene were issued under the names of two residents of Punjab province and the pair later told authorities their names were misused.

There are about 103 million SIM card holders in Pakistan and the goal is to re-check everyone by April 13, said a spokesman for the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.

Pakistan's five cellular companies worked with the PTA to install fingerprint scanning devices around the country, and already about 60 million SIM cards have been verified and seven million blocked.

Mobile phone companies have launched advertising campaigns and sent mobile vans around the country to win the people over. Their websites warn SIM card holders of impending cut off dates.

And while some Pakistanis are frazzled at the added bureaucracy, others agree the measure could help curb illegal cellphone usage.

Hussain Khan who had to wait for 40 minutes at a cellphone company office in Islamabad said: 'Those who have some bad intentions and are misusing cellphones will not turn up for this verification. They know how to get their way.

But Badshah Hussain, a 38-year-old vegetable vendor, was a bit more upbeat saying: 'This will not only help curb crime and terrorism but also protect people from ... problems and troubles.'
