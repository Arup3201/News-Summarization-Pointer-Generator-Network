A suspicious neighbour helped put a burglar behind bars after he noticed the crook wearing gloves on a hot day, and quickly took his photograph.

Eagle-eyed postman Robin Bamber, 50, took two pictures of burglar Matthew Taylor lurking in the street the morning after he had broken into his sleeping next door neighbour’s home and stolen a laptop, iPad and mobile phones.

Taylor had targeted the house in Bolton-Le-Sands, Lancashire, in June after a friend told him he had successfully burgled another property there.

Detectives, who had told neighbours to be vigilant following a spate of burglaries in the area, hailed Mr Bamber a 'hero'.

Taylor, 27, of Morecambe, Lancashire, was jailed for three years at Preston Crown Court after admitting two burglaries.

The court heard how he had 
broken into a house in Lancaster just days before and stolen £880 pounds 
of electrical goods.

Guilty: Burglar Matthew Taylor was jailed for three years

Officers swooped on Taylor’s home and found stolen items stashed behind his sofa covered in his fingerprints.

Mr Bamber, a father-of-one, said: 'Our next door neighbour had been burgled and police told us to give them a ring if we saw anything suspicious.

'My wife Morag was going to work, at about 8.30am, and I was on the driveway when this lad came past on his bike.

'It was a warm morning and I couldn’t understand why he was wearing gloves and a pink rucksack. He looked a bit suspicious.

'I went upstairs, leaned out of the window and, while he was walking along the bank with his bike, I took two pictures.

'I rang the police and they took a statement off me.'

A Royal Mail employee at the time, Robin happened to be off work recovering from an operation and modestly played down the part he played.

He said: 'It was just on the off-chance, we get a lot of walkers and cyclists around here. If the police hadn’t been round I wouldn’t have thought anything of it.

'I was pleased to be able to help, especially as it was my next door neighbour’s house.'

DC Paul Donnelly, of Lancashire Police, said: 'The resident had questioned why someone would be wearing gloves in June and had the foresight to take his photograph as they thought something wasn’t quite right.

'Taylor was subsequently identified from the photograph and we are where we are today partly thanks to it. This was great work from a vigilant member of the public.'
