Although he belongs to one of the most endangered primate species in the world, this sifaka lemur scampers across a track looking totally carefree.

The black and white lemur shows its dexterity on two legs as it is pictured running along the ground.

The trick shot, which makes it appear as if there are five lemurs, was taken by Dale Morris using time-lapse photography.

Up close: British photographer Dale Morris spent time with the charismatic primates during a visit to the African island and captured the curious creatures in action

The British photographer travelled to Madagascar to get close to the charismatic primates.

There are more than 100 species of lemur living on the African island and all sifkaka are endangered and are classed as between vulnerable and critically endangered.

Mr Morris, 40, was able to capture a vast array of species on camera and his
intimate collection includes multiple shots of a bright-white lemur 
scampering across a path and newborn babies clutching onto their 
mother's tail.

However, the expedition was not without drama.

Mr Morris said lemurs, such as the ring-tailed, that are thriving on the island are so used to humans that they can cause trouble.

A troop even raided his hotel room when he left the window open.

Give it to me: A lemur reaches out as if to grab the camera. Photographer Dale Morris said many lemurs live in nature reserves and are used to tourists

Not camera shy: Most lemurs take no notice of tourists snapping away but these individuals certainly took an interest in the cameras

Curious: Two lemurs look suspicious as they crawl along the ground towards the camera, while a nervous companion pokes its head from behind a tree

He said: 'Many of the daytime lemur species live in nature reserves and are quite accustomed to tourists taking their photos.

'They seem to get on with their daily business regardless of who is watching or taking photos of them.

'Some
of them are so used to people that they will raid your hotel room 
looking for food if you leave the window open and will even beg at 
open-air restaurants.

'A 
Lemur did a poo down my shirt during one photo shoot. I also woke up in 
my hotel room in Berenty reserve to find a troop of ring tailed lemurs 
bouncing around on the bed with me.

'They scattered when I woke and shooed them away, but not before stealing my bananas and also my last packet of cigarettes - which I later found shredded and dumped in the forest.'

Astounded: Dale Morris said he was amazed by the vast range of lemur species in Madagascar. There are more than 100 species on the island

Time for your close up: Dale Morris was able to shoot the lemurs at very close proximity both up trees and on the ground

Mr Morris, a freelance nature 
photographer from north London, also travelled to the spiky forests to 
the south of the island to see species of lemur.

It can be risky business as the trees are heavily spiked and branches easily break and fall when disturbed by the animals.

Mr Morris added: 'I was surprised by how many beautiful lemur species there are - over 100 - and how many of them are close to extinction.

''I learned that once upon a time there were lemur species as large as a man. Now that would have been something to see.'
