It's normally the stars on the court that get all the attention.

But this year at Wimbledon, tongues have been wagging at the big names saturating the Royal Box.

For the seats normally filled by socialites and Cliff Richard have instead been nabbed by the creme of A-list celebrities.

Day one: Guests at Murray's opener included basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal (right), the Duke of Kent (front centre), and Formula 1's Jackie Stewart (front far left)

Day two: TV stars Vernon Kay and Tess Daly enjoyed the action with impressionist Alistair McGowan and his wife. In front was Bruce Forsyth and his wife Wilnelia (left)

Day three: Today, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, graces centre court in canary yellow, flanked by her sister Annabel Elliot

Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman graced the 
exclusive stands on the second day yesterday, perching himself next to 
Today presenter John Humphrys.

Along the row, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daly sat next to her husband Vernon Kay and behind her former co-host Bruce Forsyth and his wife Lady Wilnelia.

And on her other side, TV impressionist Alistair McGowan was also seen enjoying the day.

Their seats were warmed the day before by an equally star-studded set.

Heads turned at the surprise appearance of basketball great Shaquille O'Neal with his girlfriend Laticia Rolle.

They joined some of SW19's more regular guests, including the Duke of Kent.

Today, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, arrived at the All England Club to take her seat next to her sister Annabel Elliot.

She was wearing a canary yellow and spotted Anna Valentine dress, with a tennis racquet pin on her jacket.

An avid tennis fan, Camilla met British player Laura Robson, last year's Wimbledon runner-up Lisicki and Canadian player Milos Raonic, as well as ball boys, ball girls, and members of the armed forces.

Star-studded: Marion Bartoli (left), the singles champion, sat in front of Today presenter John Humphrys and Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman yesterday

Shady: The X-Men star's bizarre, slick new look attracted much attention to the seat rather than the grass of centre court

Dress code: With the men suited, and the ladies in formal dresses - but strictly no hats - the celebrity guests looked the part for the royal box

Kicking off: Formula One star Sir Jackie Stewart and his wife Helen took front row seats at the opening day of the competition

It is the fourth time the Duchess has 
attended the Grand Slam, which she will watch from the exclusive Royal 
Box on centre court.

They
 are seated alongside the former cricketer Geoffrey Boycott, Hollywood 
producer Riza Aziz, and former Rugby champion Sir Clive Woodward.

The Royal Box has been used for the entertainment of friends and guests of Wimbledon since 1922.

With just 74 dark green wicker chairs up for grabs, a spot is hotly contested.

Greetings: Before taking her seat at her fourth Grand Slam in SW19, the Duchess smiled as she greeted ball boys and ball girls working at the tournament

Royal families - both British and foreign - customarily receives invites.

Government leaders, tennis figures, business partners, members of the armed forces, and media organisations can also bank on a seat.

But it is no whimsical invitation process.

Guests are nominated by the Championships' Organising Committee, the Lawn Tennis Association, and other relevant sources.

Nervous: Kim Sears, Andy Murray's girlfriend, got to the stands early to watch her boyfriend's clash with Slovenia's Blaz Rola on day three

Day three: As the sun held out, Gabby Roslin looked delighted making her way to watch Andy Murray play in one of his first matches of the tournament

The rest of the stands: Gwendoline Christie, of Game Of Thrones, and Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery caught Rafael Nadal's match yesterday

Tense: Comedian Jack Whitehall looked enraptured by Murray's clash with David Coffin on Monday

Strictly Wimbledon: Alesha Dixon and her backing dancer boyfriend Azuka Ononye laughed and cuddled watching Nadal play Martin Klizan

Day one crowd: Skyfall's Bond girl Naomie Harris cackled watching Murray in front of Joely Richardson and behind Sophie Ellis-Bextor

These suggestions are then passed to the chairman of the All England Club, who contacts the lucky few who make the grade.

If selected, guests are invited to the Clubhouse for lunch, tea, and drinks at the end of the day.

The dress code is smart - no t-shirts. Men wear suits, jackets and a tie. Ladies, meanwhile, are asked to dress smart but avoid wearing hats which obscure the vision of people behind them.

A host of other famous faces also caught the action - albeit from the less exclusive stands.

Gabby Roslin was seen arriving today to take her seat on court 1 to watch Andy Murray's next match.

Star turns: Pixie Lott and Joely Richardson took advantage of the good weather with sunglasses and iced tea

Nipping out: While Andy Murray played to packed crowds, including Laura Mvula (in red), singer Ellie Goulding slipped out of the stands

Rizzle dazzle: Rizzle Kicks stars Jordan Stephens and Harley Alexander Sule joined Radio 1 presenter Jameela Jamil for a day out in SW19 on day one

Kim Sears, Murray's girlfriend, will also be in the main stands.

On the first day, stars in the main stands included comedian Jack Whitehall and radio presenter Jameela Jamil who sat with members of the band Rizzle Kicks.

Joely Richardson was seen gazing at centre court with Pixie Lott behind actress Naomie Harris, of Skyfall fame.

In front of her, Sophie Ellis-Bextor looked animated, enjoying the day of tennis with her husband Richard Jones, the bassist of The Feeling.
