Whether it’s a red tartan suit or a SpongeBob SquarePants dress, Rita Ora is known for her fearless fashion choices.

But the Kosovan-born singer might want to be a little more careful with her outfits after a pair of trainers landed her in the centre of a £100,000 legal battle.

As the face of the spring/summer 2013 campaign for sportswear brand Superga – a label owned by Scottish firm GL Dameck – Ora agreed not to be seen wearing any trainers other than the company’s footwear.

Kosovan-born singer Rita Ora might want to be a little more careful with her outfits after a pair of trainers landed her in the centre of a £100,000 legal battle

But in April 2013 the singer was spotted in a pair of grubby white Converse trainers as she left Mayfair haunt Mahiki with her celebrity friends Cara Delevingne and Ellie Goulding.

GL Dameck claimed this was a breach of Miss Ora’s contract and cited the Converse incident as a reason for withholding the third and fourth instalments of the singer’s £180,000 fee.

Court documents show that on May 1, 2013, Jason Fairclough of GL Dameck emailed Miss Ora’s representative, saying: ‘Anyway, how do we square this? I guess we could go heavy on public events.

'Get Rita to wear the product as much as possible over the summer? Ask Rita to tweet pics of her in the product, name-checking the brand?

‘This should be happening regardless but we could crank it up.’

Then on June 17, he emailed another one of Ora’s representatives, writing: ‘We need to get Rita seen out and about in the shoes.

‘We still have a number of contracted appearances and time is running out.’

Miss Ora admitted breaching a clause of the agreement but claimed it did not excuse GL Dameck’s failure to pay her fee.

She demanded payment of £90,000 plus VAT, costs and interest – and the case has now been settled out of court.

Representatives for Rita Ora and GL Dameck declined to comment.
