When one man decided to google himself out of curiosity he found his face on Northern California's Most Wanted website and decided to turn himself in.

Christopher Viatafa, 27, of Paolo, Alto California handed himself over to the San Leandro police station where he was wanted for allegedly firing a handgun at the San Leandro Senior Center on East 14 street on August 8.

According to police he got into an argument, pulled out his gun, and fired a few shots at the ground.

Even though no one was harmed, police wanted him on suspicion that he shot a firearm towards an inhabited building.

SFGate.com reports that when Viatafa saw himself on the Most Wanted website he turned himself in so that he could clear his conscience.

As of Friday, Viatafa was listed on the site as a 'captured fugitive.'

The website has been around since December and is aimed at finding criminals from across the San Francisco Bay area. It's a cooperative between state, local, and federal police services.

â€˜The site has been a valuable tool for both law enforcement and the public in finding criminals,â€™ explained Mike Sena, the director of Northern California Regional Intelligence Centre to SFGate.com.
