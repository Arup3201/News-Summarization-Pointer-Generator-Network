Best supermarket in the UK: Waitrose scored 73% in the Which? survey of 7,000 respondents

Waitrose has returned to the top of the Which? supermarkets survey - narrowly beating last year's winner, Aldi. Iceland, Lidl and M&S were also rated highly in the survey of 7,001 UK supermarket shoppers. 

It was the only supermarket to be rated as poor for pricing, and was 'shockingly far behind everyone else' on value for money, with just 35 per cent of customers thinking it is good or excellent in this regard, the watchdog said.

It is also considered the worst supermarket for special offers, the poll revealed, and gained the worst rating for own-label products, with only frozen food specialist Iceland rated as poorly for fresh produce.

Shoppers were asked to mark the supermarkets out of five in six categories: customer service; pricing; quality of own-label products; quality of fresh products;  store environment and filling your trolley.

Waitrose scored five stars for customer service, quality of own-label products and store environment.

It scored three stars for pricing and four stars respectively for quality of fresh products and filling your trolley.

The Co-op was the only supermarket to be rated as poor for pricing, and was 'shockingly far behind everyone else,' Which? said

Aldi won an overall customer score of 72 per cent followed by Iceland, Lidl and Marks & Spencer with 69 per cent.

Aldi scored four stars in three categories - pricing, quality of own label products and fresh products but was let down by customer service (two stars), store environment (two stars) and filling your trolley (three stars),

Morrisons and Sainsbury's managed a score of 63 per cent, followed by Asda on 62 per cent and Tesco on 60 per cent.

Ocado came top of the online supermarket table for the fifth year running despite competition from more competitors in the form of Iceland and Morrisons.

Consumers told the consumer group that value and good quality food products are the most important factors in choosing where to shop.

Aldi and Lidl have seen significant increases in sales in the past year and Iceland posted a large increase in profit last year.

Meanwhile, the big four supermarkets have stuttered, losing market share to their cheaper rivals as well as Waitrose.

Respondents were only asked about supermarkets they had shopped with, and each retailer's overall customer score was based on a combination of customer satisfaction and the likelihood they would recommend it to a friend.

Customers described Waitrose staff as 'all polite, attentive and well-mannered' while the poll found shoppers praised the 'exceptionally tidy' stores as well as the trolleys, lack of queues and wide aisles which made for a 'relaxed feel and shopping experience'.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Waitrose has returned to the top of our supermarket league table, rated the best for customer satisfaction by the public and narrowly beating Aldi, last year's number one.

'Thousands of people told us that value and good quality food products are the most important factors in choosing where to shop.'

Waitrose managing director Mark Price said: 'We're grateful to all the customers who voted for us.

'It's a great accolade and fantastic recognition for the energy and hard work our 61,000 partners put into creating the best possible experience for shoppers both in our shops and online.'

An Aldi spokesperson said: 'In 2014 over half of the UK visited an Aldi store. We are pleased that customers continue to choose Aldi and this is further proof that people value our everyday low prices and high quality products.' 

Speaking about the report, Nigel Broadhurst,joint managing director of Iceland, commented: 'We're thrilled to have been rated so highly by real shoppers in this Which? report.

'Our excellent, value offering does not come at the expense of other aspects of our stores which are important to our customers, such as customer service, varied product ranges and a pleasant store environment. We work hard to achieve this balance.

'We're especially pleased to see our online offering rated so highly. This was launched nationally in October 2013, so it's fantastic to see it do so well in comparison to stores which have been online for a lot longer.

'It's clear that our great value, great service, and great choice model gives shoppers what they want, whether they prefer to shop online or in store.'
