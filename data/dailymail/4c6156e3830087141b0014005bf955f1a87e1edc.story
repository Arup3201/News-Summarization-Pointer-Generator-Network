Christian Louboutin recently lost a court battle against Yves Saint Laurent over their iconic red-soled shoes.

But it seems they aren't the only designer brands locked in legal battles after luxurious French label Chanel was ordered to pay one of its former knitwear suppliers, World Tricot, a staggering £161,000.

The bitter relationship between the two companies began back in 2009 when the knitwear company tried to sue Chanel for £3.6 million.

World Tricot sought £1.3 million for 'wrongful termination of the business relationship' and a further £2.3 million for alleged counterfeiting of a white crochet pattern, which has become a key design on many of their luxurious bags.

After denying all the accusations, World Tricot were ordered to pay Chanel £161,000 euros for 'public disparagement' but the tables have since turned leaving Chanel in the firing line.

Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld has made the brand what it is today

'This is the first time we have faced this type of situation, although we work with close to 400 suppliers.

'This very specific case is in no way a reflection of the quality of our relations with our suppliers,' said Bruno Pavlovsky, president of Chanel fashion in an interview with WWD .

It is the brand most famous for it's stylish and classic designs, from quilted clutch bags to irresistible perfumes.

But where did it all start?

The infamous and iconic Coco Chanel was born in 1883 and set up the House of Chanel in 1909 when she opened the first millinery shop, Chanel Modes, in Paris.

This was a role that she maintained until her death in 1971.

As the fans became more famous, the brand developed and produced revolutionary new lines of clothing and accessories.

Today, it is a brand headed up by Karl Lagefeld and fronted by the likes of actress Keria Knightley and favoured by anyone with impeccable taste.
