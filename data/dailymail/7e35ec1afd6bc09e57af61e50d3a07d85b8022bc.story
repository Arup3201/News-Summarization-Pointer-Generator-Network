Mohammed Saleem was found in a pool of blood after being stabbed

A grandfather fatally stabbed in the 
back as he walked home from a mosque was killed ‘for his faith’ in an 
‘act of terrorism’, his daughter claimed yesterday.

Mohammed Saleem, 75, was stabbed three
 times and stamped on in the senseless attack as he returned from 
evening prayers three months ago.

As police quizzed a Ukrainian over the
 killing, counter terrorist detectives launched a separate inquiry to 
discover whether the suspect – along with a potential accomplice – were 
‘lone wolves’ who have links to far-right terrorist groups.

The engineering students, aged 22 and 
25, on work placements at a high-tech computer company, were initially 
held last week by detectives investigating explosions near three mosques
 across the West Midlands.

Now the 25-year-old has also been 
arrested in connection with the investigation into the murder of Mr 
Saleem as part of the on-going counter terrorism operation into the 
blasts.

Yesterday Mr Saleem’s daughter, Shazia
 Khan, 45, said: ‘It was an act of terrorism because he was killed for 
his faith and that is exactly what the police have arrested this man 
for, on terrorism grounds.

‘We feel relieved that we are getting 
somewhere because things were going very quiet and we were getting 
worried that there was no progress being made and there were no clues.’

Mr Saleem’s widow Said, 69, who was married to him for 50 years, fought back tears to say what happened to him was ‘so wrong’.

The two suspects were on placements at
 software company Delcam on an industrial estate in Small Heath, 
Birmingham, one-and-a-half miles from Mr Saleem’s home.

The firm has a training centre in 
Lutsk, Ukraine, and close links with universities in the country – a 
known hotbed of anti-Islamic hatred.

Ultra-nationalist party, Svoboda (Freedom) was a shock winner in elections there last year, capturing 10 per cent of the vote.

Members of Ukrainian female protest 
group Femen demonstrated topless in London to draw attention to what 
they called ‘bloody Islamist regimes’ taking part in the 2012 Olympics.

Mr Saleem, described as a ‘highly 
respected’ figure in the community, was found by horrified neighbours in
 a pool of blood just yards from his front door on April 29.

The father of seven, who suffered from
 arthritis and walked with the aid of a stick, was pronounced dead in 
hospital later that night.

The remnants of a home-made explosive 
device were found outside a mosque in Walsall on June 21. A nail bomb 
then exploded outside a mosque in Tipton on July 12 in a terror attack 
apparently timed to coincide with the funeral of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who
 was murdered in Woolwich in May.

Evidence of the third bombing, on a 
roundabout near Wolverhampton Central Mosque, was uncovered by police 
‘following intelligence’ after the men’s arrest on Thursday.

That case was believed to date back to
 June 28 when officers were sent to the scene following reports of an 
explosion but nothing was found. The attacks all occurred on a Friday – a
 day when mosques would usually be busy. But nobody was injured in any 
of the explosions.

The two Ukrainians were initially 
arrested in Small Heath on Thursday on suspicion of being involved in 
the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.

Delcam chief executive Clive Martell said at the time one of the men had been at the company for four months, the other for two.

‘The two men were on work placements 
with us, but were not employees,’ he said. ‘They were around halfway 
through the course and we understand they met each other whilst on the 
placement.’ Counter terrorism officers were on Saturday granted an extra
 seven days to question the Ukrainian nationals in connection with the 
explosions.

In March 2013 Home Office security 
minister James Brokenshire warned that far-right extremism is a 
‘worrying phenomenon’ posing a ‘real’ threat to UK security.

Extremists include Terence Gavan, a 
former British National Party member, who was jailed for 11 years in 
2010 after 50 explosive devices and more than 30 guns were found in his 
concealed room in Batley, West Yorkshire.

The most notorious far-right bomber in
 the UK was David Copeland, from Yateley, Hampshire, who targeted black 
people in Brixton, Asians in Brick Lane and gays in Soho with nail 
bombs. He killed three people and injured 139, including four who lost 
limbs.

Europe’s most notorious hard right 
extremist, Anders Breivik, bombed government buildings in Oslo, killing 
eight, and then shot dead 69 people, mostly teenage members of the 
Norwegian Labour Party, in July 2011.
