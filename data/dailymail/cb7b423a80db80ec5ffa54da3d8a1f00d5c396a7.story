Rodriguez scored both goals in his country's 2-0 win against their South American rivals last month, but it was exquisite opener that captivated those 70,000 spectators inside the iconic Maracana Stadium and the millions around the world watching.

The midfield playmaker chest controlled a looping header from team-mate Juan Cuadrado before swivelling and unleashing an unstoppable effort that crashed in off the underside of Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera's crossbar.

The Real Madrid bound star becomes the third successive South American winner of the award.

At the last summer showpiece in 2010 Uruguay's Diego Forlan won the award for his breath-taking effort against Germany during their third-place play-off encounter; while in 2006 Argentina's Maxi Rodriguez collected the accolade for his thumping volley against Mexico in their pulsating last-16 clash.

It is the second award Rodriguez has collected for his summer showpiece exploits after winning the Golden Boot.

Rodriguez, who Sportsmail understands is set to sign for Real from Ligue 1 outfit Monaco in a £60million move on Wednesday, scored six goals in Colombia's run to the quarter-finals.
