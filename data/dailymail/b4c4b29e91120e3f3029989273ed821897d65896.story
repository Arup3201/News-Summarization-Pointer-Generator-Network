A quick-thinking man has saved the life of a baby wallaby he found on the side of the road after wrapping it up inside a washing basket.

The hero passer-by, called Fraser, from Forestville, on Sydney's Northern Beaches, rode past the lifeless body of an adult female wallaby while on his regular Saturday morning ride on the 14th September. The animal had been struck dead by a motor vehicle.

On his way back, Fraser found a blood soaked joey which had made its way across the road. The animal was shaking where it lay in the gutter.

Fraser, a Forestville local, saved the life of a baby wallaby he found on the side of the road after wrapping it up inside a washing basket and calling for assistance

The animal was found near its mother, who had died in a road accident. He was soaked in blood, and shaking where it lay in the gutter

Quick thinking Fraser raced home, grabbed a washing basket and wrapped the joey up in a blanket, before calling Wildlife Information Rescue and Care (WIRES) for assistance.

Fraser told the Daily Mail Australia: 'It was clear the animal had to be removed from the road immediately and kept warm. It had probably been injured for several hours and may not have survived much longer.' 

Fraser explained that his upbringing played a part in how he dealt with the situation. 'I grew up on a property in Central Victoria so we used to come across a lot of animals in need. It comes naturally to me.'

When Fraser next saw the animal, he had been cleaned up and brought back to good health. As a gesture of gratitude, the Joey was named Fraser, after his rescuer. 

'It brought a smile top my face when I heard he was named after me. It was wonderful to see when the little animal was cleaned up. 

'An active and  beautiful marsupial. Who wouldn't want to take care of a lovely little animal like that?'  

Fraser explained that his upbringing played a part in how he dealt with the situation, as he grew up on a property with lots of wildlife and helping animals came naturally to him

Fraser has spent time in a humidicrib and a small backpack to simulate the mothers warm dark pouch. The animal has also been hand with a special milk formula

Robyn said the animal will stay with her for another few months until they find somewhere bigger for him, and when he is big enough he will be released into the wild

Fraser is now under the care of Robyn, a WIRES volunteer and fellow Forestville local. Robyn has volunteered for WIRES for twelve years, having cared for possums, bandicoots, gliders, wallabies. She is currently looking after another young wallaby and a flying fox.  

Robyn told Daily Mail that the animal was very lucky to have survived.

'When I first saw him, he was drenched with blood, one of his eyes was closed over. He was very cold and wasn't moving at all. 

'I took him to Waif clinic in St Ives, and thankfully they said he hadn't sustained any injuries in the accident-it was all his mothers blood. From that point it was just a matter of warming him up with heat packs and giving him fluids to deal with the stress.

'Fraser has spent time in a humidicrib and a small backpack to simulate the mothers warm dark pouch. I also hand feed the joey with a special milk formula.'

Now Fraser is eating and healthy. Robyn said he is barely recognisable from when she first saw him.

'He will stay with me for another few months until they find somewhere bigger for him. He will be at that residence for a few months and when he is big enough he will be released into the wild.
