Mauro Zarate has refuted claims that he wants to leave West Ham.

Speaking to Italian media, agent Luis Ruzzi spoke about Zarate's future and said: 'At West Ham he plays behind the strikers and that is not his position.

'He is a centre-forward and if there is a team out there willing to let him play in his natural role, then we will be very happy to consider it.

The Argentine's only goal for the Hammers came away at Crystal Palace at the back-end of August 

'Mauro is often used out of position by the current coach (Sam Allardyce) and this is pushing him to seriously consider changing his club. It's true he has a contract until 2017 with the Hammers but I think we can find a solution to suit everyone.

'It's a shame that, apart from his time at Velez, in recent years they make him play out of position. He is a striker, a hitman. At this time you could get Zarate for a much lower price than he is really worth. Anyone who decides to go for him will certainly be getting a bargain.'

However, Zarate took to twitter to clarify his situation, saying: 'According to recent news articles I would like to inform that I have no agent and I never said that I wanted to leave West Ham. If that would happen it would be because a joint decision of the club and myself. 

'The most important thing is that West Ham will keep progressing. The manager is doing a great job and has my full support! Come on you irons!'

Zarate, top scorer in Argentinian Primera Division with 13 goals in 19 games for Velez Sarsfield last season, has been linked with a move to Serie A side Torino.
