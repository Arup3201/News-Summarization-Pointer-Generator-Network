A Brisbane internet tycoon who turned informant for the FBI and was instrumental in shutting down America's online poker industry is set to avoid more jail time.

Daniel Tzvetkoff, 30, was arrested in Las Vegas in 2010 for illegally processing more than $US1 billion for online poker companies through his company Intabill.

The business whiz, who had been making $3 million a week, faced a 76-year jail term for the crimes and served four months in jail before turning informant for the FBI and providing information that helped to shut down some of the biggest online poker companies in the U.S. including PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker.

Daniel Tvetkoff, 30, from Brisbane was facing a jail term of up to 76 years for processing more than $1 billion for online poker companies in the U.S.

Tzvetkoff was released from prison after informing on the poker companies and returned to Australia where he is living with his wife Nicole and two children â€“ a four-year-old son and two-year-old daughter.

Now it seems as though his time as a grass for the FBI will keep him from serving any more jail time, with a probation report recommending that he receive a sentence of between six and 12 months imprisonment.

His lawyer, Robert Goldstein, is arguing that the four months his client has already served in jail is sufficient.

'For a first-time offender who has never before experienced prison, four-plus months inside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn constitutes a harsh and significant punishment,' Mr Goldstein wrote in his sentencing submission, reported the Courier Mail.

'The reality is that even one day in those type of conditions can be exceedingly harsh punishment for a first-time offender like Mr Tzvetkoff.'

Tzvetkoff struck a lucrative, though legally dubious, deal with online poker companies after the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was passed in the U.S. in 2005. The act made it illegal to move money online for bets on any 'sporting event or contest or game of chance'.

Tzvetkoff and his business partner Sam Sciacca provided brokerage services to online poker companies and Tzvetkoff was soon earning a reported $3 million a week.

He was arrested in 2010 for his part in the racket. At the time of his arrest Tzvetkoff also had a reported personal debt of $143 million, which meant he was being sought by mob figures as well as police.

After four months in jail, Tzvetkoff handed over 90,000 documents from Intabill to prosecutors, which helped shut down some of the biggest online poker companies in the U.S. including PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker.
