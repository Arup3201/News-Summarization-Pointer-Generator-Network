Patients are increasingly turning to the internet to self-diagnose their health problems as they struggle to get an appointment with a GP.

The number of visitors to NHS Choices, the Government’s health website, jumped by 40 per cent compared to last year and nearly 160 per cent since 2012, data released today reveals.

And two thirds of visits were to pages about the diagnosis and treatment of conditions.

The most popular topics were pregnancy and baby health, viewed 29.5million times so far this year. File image

The most popular topics were pregnancy and baby health, viewed 29.5million times so far this year.

Other common searches were about mental health, stomach ache, chicken pox and back pain, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, which runs the website.

Campaigners said patients are turning to the internet because it is increasingly difficult to get a GP appointment or to see the same GP to get consistent advice about a chronic condition.

Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said the situation was ‘terrible’.

Earlier this year, the Royal College of GPs warned of a ‘crisis’ as surgeries struggle to cope with a growing and ageing population.

It also said patients face a ‘postcode lottery’ – in some areas there are just 22 full-time equivalent GPs for every 100,000 patients. Dr Maureen Baker, the college’s chairman, said: ‘There is no harm in using reputable websites, such as NHS Choices, but people should be cautious about trying to diagnose themselves.

‘GPs are the most trusted professionals in the NHS and it is important that we remain the first port of call for patients.’

The NHS Choices site has been viewed one billion times since its launch in 2007.

Broken nails, blocked noses and hair loss are prompting hundreds of calls to the NHS’s 111 urgent care helpline. Other minor problems such as sunburn, stubbed toes and even an itch mean calls to the number have doubled in a year, with almost one million made every month.
