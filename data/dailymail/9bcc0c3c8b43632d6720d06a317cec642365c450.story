Real Housewives Of Atlanta star Kenya Moore gave Anderson Cooper a sneak peek of her new Booty Boot Camp workout DVD and it appears that he got a little more 'booty' than he bargained for.

The chat show host struggled to hide his bemusement as he watched a clip of Miss Moore, 42, demonstrating the 
'booty pop' move, which involves getting down into a 'nice wide straddle
position' and 'popping' the glute muscles from left to right.

'That’s to isolate the muscles so you know where they are, so you can help to firm, lift and round them out,' the former Miss USA explained after the preview played.

'I do that every morning,' Mr Cooper humorously replied.

Miss Moore has come to blows with her Real Housewives co-star Phaedra Parks over the announcement of her fitness video.

The pair were originally meant to be collaborating on a project called Donkey Booty, but they went their separate ways after arguing about money issues.

Phaedra Parks’ Phine 
Body DVD hit shelves in December and Miss Moore's Booty Boot Camp will be available from March 5.

The battle of the booty reached a head recently when Ms Parks accused Miss Moore of having buttock implants.

In an interview with In Touch, she said: 'If you’re gonna sell a video talking about bottoms, you need to have one that’s homegrown,

'I’ve never been altered by plastic surgery. My butt is really my butt. [Kenya’s] is full of silicone!'

Speaking about the accusations on Anderson Live Miss Moore said:
'It’s unfortunate because no one ever has to take it there.

'You know 
we’re on a show, we’re both doing something pretty positive, helping 
people to workout, and she takes it to a kind of gutter level.'

The upcoming release of Miss Moore's DVD is likely to further aggravate the situation.

A press release states that her video consists three 20-minute workouts that will 'sculpt your lower body, shrink your waistline, flatten and define your 
abs, and, most importantly, lift and firm your backside.'

Miss Parks explained that the workout will help people achieve a 'stallion booty'.

Asked why she used the word stallion she explained 'they’re muscular, they’re strong… they’re winners you know, they’re race horses.'

She said that she is happy the Donkey Booty project fell-though, adding: 'A donkey is basically a service animal it’s short it’s stout it’s sad it’s out of shape, it’s broke down.

'Who wants to look like a donkey when they can look like a stallion?'
