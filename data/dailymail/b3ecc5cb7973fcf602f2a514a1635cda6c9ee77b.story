Far-right: Dennis Pearce, brother of England's caretaker manager, stood as a Parliamentary candidate for the BNP

The England football team was plunged into a fresh racism row last night as caretaker manager Stuart Pearce's family links to the BNP resurfaced

Dennis Pearce, the current England U-21 boss's brother, is a BNP supporter who stood as a Parliamentary candidate for the far-Right party.

And the appointment of Pearce, 49, has again brought into the spotlight racial controversy he himself was embroiled in as a player in 1994.

He was forced to apologise to black footballer Paul Ince for allegedly racially abusing him during a Premier League game.

A surprised Adrian Bevington, managing director of Club England, yesterday dismissed questions over the caretaker manager's sibling.

He said: ‘Stuart has made it clear in the past that he is not involved in his brother’s political beliefs.’

Speaking in 2009, Pearce said: 'My brother's political views are his own and are not in anyway reflected in my own views.'

Dennis added: 'I don't discuss politics with Stuart. I'm close to my brother. We both believe and vote in a democracy.

'Our family has got different views and respect other people's views. We don't dictate to each other what we should think.'

With regard to the incident with Ince, Mr Bevington said yesterday: ‘I certainly can’t talk about the comment you’re raising there.’

The clash between the footballers prompted the Professional Footballers' Association — which was running an anti-racism campaign at the time — to intervene.

Pearce allegedly made the comments to Manchester United's Ince — an England colleague — during a Premier League game at Old Trafford in 1994, when he was playing for Nottingham Forest.

PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said 
at the time: 'Stuart will be ringing Paul to apologise. Stuart regrets 
what he said. It was said in the heat of the moment.’

Pearce will take charge of the national 
team for the friendly against Holland on February 29 after Capello's 
resignation was sparked by another race row surrounding John Terry.

The Chelsea star was stripped of the England captaincy ahead of his court case over an alleged racist rant directed at QPR player Anton Ferdinand.

The Football Association's decision to remove the armband from Terry preceded Capello's exit from the top job on Wednesday.

Chairman David Bernstein called Pearce a 'first-class' caretaker and did not rule out a permanent post.

Bernstein said the FA were open to the idea of appointing a manager for this summer’s European Championship and one who then starts with the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign.

Harry Redknapp remains the clear favourite to be offered the job, possibly just for the European Championships if he wants to remain Tottenham boss next season.
