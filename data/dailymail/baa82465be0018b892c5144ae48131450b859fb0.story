Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry spent a night in a police cell after he was arrested following an incident at his home.

Central defender Hendry, nicknamed 'Braveheart', was held after officers were called to a ‘domestic situation’ at his rented house in Lytham, Lancashire on Saturday night.

Blackburn coach Hendry, 46, whose partner is nail technician Sarah Kinder, was released without charge on Sunday.

The couple met in 2010 after Hendry’s 
wife Denise died the previous year following complications with cosmetic
surgery - a botched tummy tuck.

A police spokesman said: ‘Colin Hendry was arrested and held but no charges have been laid against him.’

Hendry, played for Blackburn and Rangers, winning league titles with both clubs and representing Scotland 51 times.

The father of four was declared bankrupt in 2010 with over £1million in debts to the Inland Revenue and betting companies.

Spreadex, an online sports betting firm, filed a bankruptcy petition against the former Scotland World Cup captain at Blackpool County Court. He was understood to owe the company £35,000.

Hendry was forced to accept an undisclosed bid for his £1.7million Georgian home on the seafront at Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.

It was understood there was an outstanding re-mortgage debt of nearly £1million on the house, which he bought outright for £750,000 in 2001.

Speaking about his relationship with Ms Kinder last year he said: 'We have been together about 18 months and have gone on holiday together.

'Sarah accompanies me on trips to London when I do my TV work. She is now an important part of my life.

'Sarah has helped me through the last 18 months, particularly the bankruptcy.

'We get on well together and have a lot in common. She has met the kids and they have accepted her.'
