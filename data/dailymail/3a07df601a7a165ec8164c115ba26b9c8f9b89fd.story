Danger to the public: Opemipo Jaji (pictured) was jailed for a minimum of eight years today for raping an 11-year-old girl while he was on probation

A dangerous teenage paedophile was jailed for a minimum of eight years today for raping an 11-year-old girl while he was on probation.

Opemipo Jaji, 18, from Edmonton, north London, had just left his probation officer when he spotted the child going home from school on a bus before following her and dragging her into a park to subject her to a three-hour rape ordeal.

Mr Justice Singh at the Old Bailey told Jaji that he had given careful consideration to whether he could impose a lesser sentence than life, for example a determinate sentence combined with an extended term.

'However, in all the circumstances of this case, I do not believe that the public would be adequately protected from you if you were the subject of any sentence other than a life sentence,' he said.

The judge told Jaji that the eight-year minimum was not the actual term he would serve, but the minimum before he could be considered for release by the Parole Board.

'The Parole Board will only direct your release on licence if it is satisfied that you are no longer a danger to members of the public,' he added.

Jaji had been given an 18-month supervision order six months before for making indecent images of children.

A year earlier, he had sexually assaulted and robbed a 12-year-old schoolgirl on a housing estate.

Later, he was given a 10-month detention and training order which he went on to breach.

He was found guilty of rape following a trial at the Old Bailey in April after he had denied raping the girl in Jubilee Park, Enfield, north London, in November, last year.

The child gave evidence against him on videolink during the trial.

The judge told Jaji: 'You got off the bus at the same stop as her and you then followed her. You dragged her into Jubilee Park and subjected her to a horrific ordeal for the next three hours.

'Not only did you rape her at least twice. You stuffed one of her gloves in her mouth. You threatened her and said that you had a knife although you did not in fact produce one.

'You told her not to tell anyone about what had happened because you would stab her. Even the risk of being seen by a member of the public did not deter you from carrying on with your vicious attack on your lonely and vulnerable victim.

'When a passer-by walking his dog was nearby, you told her to curl up and keep quiet so that she would not be noticed.

'At
one point you even told her that the incident was being filmed and that
you would send the video to her school where people would laugh at 
her.'

The girl suffered 
injuries which meant she had to go to hospital where she had to be 
examined under anaesthetic and needed stitches.

'Perhaps
even worse, you have left her with terrible emotional scars. One can 
only hope that, with the courage that she has already shown in giving 
evidence at this trial, and with the support of her family and friends, 
she can begin the process of recovery.'

The
judge said that until recently Jaji had shown no remorse for the 
terrible offence he had committed. 'Since your conviction you now accept
that you did commit this offence.' 

A
psychiatric report stated that he had 'a small insight' into his 
offence 'but this does provide a platform for you to work within a 
sexual offenders treatment programme'.

The
judge added: 'However, I approach the degree of your apparent remorse 
with some caution. I had the opportunity to observe you when you gave 
evidence at your trial. It is clear to me that you are well capable of 
lying and of manipulating others around you to suit your own interests.'

Jaji was 'an intelligent young man who had potential'.

                                           Mr Justice Singh

But the judge added: 'It is also clear that you have an unhealthy interest in little girls.'

He
had told both a probation officer and a psychiatrist that he 'had been 
planning to rape a girl for about two months before the offence, 
although the offence itself was committed on impulse'.

It was not disputed by Jaji’s counsel that he was dangerous, the judge added.

Scotland
Yard said in a statement that forensic samples found on Jaji’s 
trainers, white bag strap and underwear all directly linked him to the 
victim. His fingerprints were also found on the victim’s Oyster card 
holder.

Cell site analysis of his mobile phone also placed him in the vicinity of the park at the time of the attack.

Detective Chief Inspector Adam Lowe, 
who led the investigation, said: 'Jaji posed a great danger to young 
girls and despite the great weight of evidence against him, refused to 
accept his guilt and forced the victim to give evidence in court.

'This
was a particularly brutal but unusual attack on an innocent 11-year-old
schoolgirl who will no doubt continue to suffer the emotional scars of 
what happened to her for a very long time. I would like to take this 
opportunity to praise the bravery of the victim and her family.'

Mr
Lowe also told reporters at the court: 'His offending escalation and 
lack of victim empathy is a clear indication of his dangerousness.'

The risk he posed had been registered by the police and its partners.

Officers raised their concerns with a multi-agency public protection forum or Mappa which planned imminently to apply for an order which would establish some control over the risk he posed, but unfortunately Jaji committed this offence before this could happen.

Mr Lowe said a case review was going on into what happened.

'My organisation has done more than its statutory obligations,' he said.

A Probation Service spokeswoman said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the victim and their family following this horrific crime.

'A Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (Mappa) Serious Case Review into what happened in this case has been launched. It would be inappropriate to comment further until this is completed.'
