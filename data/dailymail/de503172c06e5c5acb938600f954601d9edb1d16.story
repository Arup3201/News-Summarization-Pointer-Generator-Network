German Chancellor Angela Merkel today hailed a role played 'behind the scenes' by former German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in helping to secure the release of Kremlin critic and Russian ex-oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

'The German government appreciates the efforts of former federal minister Genscher who worked intensively on the case behind the scenes,' Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement.

'He worked successfully on possibilities for a solution with a great level of commitment and the support of the chancellor and the foreign ministry.'

Genscher, 86, said in a statement he had decided to support Khodorkovsky's case 'for humanitarian reasons' having met him several times in the past.

Genscher, who served as Germany's top 
diplomat from 1974 to 1992, said he welcomed the pardon by Russian 
President Vladimir Putin, whom he said he had met twice to discuss the 
Khodorkovsky case, saying in a statement that the decision was 
'significant and encouraging for other cases'.

He
 also thanked Merkel, a fellow German former foreign minister and the 
German ambassador in Moscow for lending 'the greatest possible support' 
to his efforts.

Genscher, 
who arranged the flight on a private jet from Russia and picked 
Khodorkovsky up at the airport in Berlin, told news website Spiegel 
Online that Khodorkovsky was doing well under the circumstances.

'He
 is exhausted but very happy to finally be free,' he said by telephone, 
adding that Khodorkovsky now wanted to rest and would stay out of the 
public eye.

Spiegel said Khodorkovsky could be heard in the background talking to friends and relatives by phone.

It said he had received a visa that would allow him to stay for one year in the Schengen passport-free zone.

The Russian prison service said he had petitioned to be allowed to leave the country to meet his mother and insisted that he left the country of his own free will. It is not known if he left in this helicopter

Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service 
said in a statement that Khodorkovsky had petitioned to be allowed to 
travel to Germany to meet his mother who is reportedly being treated for
 cancer.

In his 10 years in 
prison on politically tinged charges of tax evasion and embezzlement, 
50-year-old Khodorkovsky turned from a powerful oligarch into a 
respected dissident, becoming a political thinker who argued for social 
justice and placed the blame on Mr Putin for Russia's stagnating 
economy.

It wasn't clear whether Khodorkovsky would continue his opposition to the Kremlin.

Mr Putin's announcement less than 24 
hours before that Khodorkovsky would be pardoned appeared to catch both 
the public and Khodorkovsky's lawyers by surprise.

His
 release was equally shrouded in mystery. Several hours before, 
Khodorkovsky's lawyers and family said they still had no idea when he 
would be let out.

Compassionate grounds: Vladimir Putin said that Russia's most famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his mother was ill

Khodorkovsky's
 father, Boris, speaking on the phone from the Moscow region said he and
 his wife, are in Moscow and are going to fly to Germany on Saturday.

Khodorkovsky's
 second wife and three children live in the Moscow region. His eldest 
son from the first marriage lives with his family in New York City.

In a shock remark after his annual 
marathon news conference yesterday, Putin had said that Russia's most 
famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his 
mother was ill.

The Kremlin followed with a swift announcement today that Putin had already signed the pardon decree.

'Guided
 by humanitarian principles, I decree that Mikhail Borisovich 
Khodorkovsky... should be pardoned and freed from any further punishment
 in the form of imprisonment.

'This decree comes into force from the day of its signing,' said the decree signed by Putin and published by the Kremlin.

Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2005.

Intense atmosphere: Putin pictured during a meeting with Khodorkovsky in 2002, a year before the oil tycoon was snatched off his corporate plane in 2003 soon after Putin warned oligarchs against meddling in politics

Vladimir Putin made the controversial claim that there was no difference between 'dictators' Josef Stalin and Oliver Cromwell.

The Kremlin leader was commenting on plans to restore statues of the Soviet tyrant and other Communist leaders more than two decades after they were toppled.  

One contentious plan backed by Russian hardliners would see monuments to Stalin and the feared founder of the Soviet secret services Felix Dzerzhinsky brought back in Moscow, moves which Putin likened to the monument to Cromwell outside the Houses of Parliament.

'How in particular is Cromwell so different from Stalin? Can you tell me? Not in any way at all,' he said.  

'From the point of view of liberals, he is the same bloody dictator.' 

Of Cromwell - a soldier and statesman who signed Charles I's death warrant before becoming England's Protector  - he said: 'He was quite a treacherous dude, one has to say.'

Khodorkovsky was then convicted of embezzlement in a second
 trial in 2010 and had been due for release in August.

It
 remained unclear exactly when the 50-year-old would be freed from his 
prison colony in the town of Segezha in the Karelia region of 
northwestern Russia.

The circumstances of the pardon also remained murky.

The
 former chief of Yukos oil company, once Russia's richest man, had 
repeatedly said he would not ask Putin for a pardon because it would be 
tantamount to admitting guilt.

The Kommersant broadsheet, citing 
unnamed sources, said on Friday Khodorkovsky had made the decision to 
seek a pardon after a recent meeting with representatives of Russia's 
security services, who had raised the menace of a third trial against 
him.

Members of the security
 services met with Khodorkovsky over the last several days, told him the
 health of his cancer-stricken mother Marina, 79, was worsening and 
warned him about a possible third criminal case against him.

'This
 conversation, which was conducted without lawyers, forced Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky to turn to the president,' said the newspaper.

Economists and political analysts put the
 announcement down to the Kremlin's bid to improve its dismal rights 
record and international image ahead of the Winter Olympic Games that 
Russia is hosting in Sochi in February.

Khodorkovsky had been due to be 
released in August 2014 but Russian prosecutors earlier this month 
raised the threat of a third trial for the former tycoon on 
money-laundering charges. Putin told reporters on Thursday that he saw no prospects for the third case.

Economists and political analysts said that while 
Khodorkovsky's imminent release was a watershed moment it would not 
dramatically change Russia's battered investment climate or 
international image.

Rivals: Putin has long singled out Khodorkovsky, who would be due for release in August, for bitter personal attacks, once saying that 'a thief should sit in jail'

'It is a
 very important signal,' said prominent economist Sergei Guriev, who 
co-authored a critical report on Khodorkovsky's second conviction in 
2010.

'In and of itself it will not change anything but it will give hope to investors,' Guriev told AFP in e-mailed comments.

He said, however, that Putin's promise to release Khodorkovsky was not enough to make him return to Russia.

Earlier
 this year, Guriev had fled to France after coming under pressure from 
investigators for his role in the Khodorkovsky report.

The
 Eurasia Group consultancy said the former tycoon's release was a 'charm
 offensive' ahead of the Sochi Olympics amid reports that heads of major
 states like Barack Obama of the United States and France's Francois 
Hollande will not be in attendance.

Political enemy: Supporters have said that Khodorkovsky (pictured when he CEO of Yukos oil company in 2001) had been thrown into jail after two trials for daring to finance opposition to the Russian strongman

Vedomosti business daily compared the announcement to a 'a trump card' Putin pulled out of his sleeve at a critical moment.

'Khodorkovsky
 personally no longer presents a threat to the system,' it said, noting 
that his release would not 'heal the wounds inflicted on the economy and
 society 10 years ago.'

'Investments
 will not return, businesses that were closed down or were never created
 will not be born again, those who emigrated will not come back,' said 
Vedomosti.

Supporters have 
said that Khodorkovsky had been thrown into jail and found guilty in two
 separate trials for daring to finance opposition to the Russian 
strongman.

He was snatched 
off his corporate plane in 2003 soon after Putin warned oligarchs 
against meddling in politics. He has been held in detention ever since.
