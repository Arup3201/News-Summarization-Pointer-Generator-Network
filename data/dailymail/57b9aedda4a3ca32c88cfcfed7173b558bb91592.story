The Mercedes team-mates, and rivals for the Formula One title, were selected by the FIA in the wake of their controversial crash at the Belgium Grand Prix.

1.55pm: While we wait for the drivers, why not take a look at Nico Rosberg's exclusive MailOnline column. He looks back at the crash in Spa, and concedes it was his error. Click here to read more. 

2.00pm: We're up and running in Monza, and the first question goes to Alonso. He says it is Ferrari's 'most important race of the year.' But the Spaniard hopes to be on the podium after signs of being more competitive in Belgium.

2.03pm: Kevin Magnussen talks of his enjoyment of racing in Spa despite a race penalty. 'We're fighting with Force India and for position in the championship,' says the Finn.  

2.10pm: Rosberg and Hamilton are asked for their opinions of the Spa crash... 

Rosberg - 'I took the week to think about it and look at it and discuss with the team. In the end it was me who should take responsibility.'

Hamilton adds with a smile: ‘This is the first time there has been so many people in the room. I am excited about moving forward. And I am excited to be here. I hope we can have a good weekend. I already said everything in the press release. Trust is a big word and that is not something I would apply to racing on the track. Me and Nico have been racing a long time and we set a foundation in karting a long time ago and that is what we work from.'

Rosberg on making history: 'In Spa I was not proud of the way it went, because in general, I want to contribute to my sport because I want it to be the most entertaining in the world. If I am able to contribute, I am happy about that and in many ways we have, so that is great.'

Hamilton adds: 'I don’t have a responsibility to history. History is created every day. I love racing and I am proud to be here. I just enjoy every single day as it comes. I personally don’t put us in the same ranking as the greats back in the day.'

2.12pm: The Mercedes pair are then quizzed on whether the team is divided: ‘I don’t feel that is the case,' says Hamilton. 'We have a professional team and they just want to win, so they will be working as hard as they can. They work collectively for the pit stops, so that (division) does not cross my mind. We have the chance for one-two finishes, and they will give it their all.'

Rosberg adds: ‘In general there has been a healthy rivalry in the team and that is why we are where we are. We have the best car. If you don’t work well as a team you can’t dominate a sport as we do at the moment, so that is proof (the team is not divided)’. 

2.15pm: Hamilton: ‘After the race it was important to move forward. What happened in the past is in the past. There is still a lot of points available so that is my focus.’

Rosberg adds: ‘It was clear from the beginning that we must not have contact as team-mates so that approach does not change.’

Packed house:  The auditorium was rammed for the Thursday afternoon press conference in Monza 

Rosberg is asked for his opinion on, according to this journalist, a so-called ‘vicious media attack' and a 'witch hunt'...

‘I respect the opinions. and then for me I try to focus on driving my race car first and working with my team and getting the best out of the situation. I am very lucky to have such a car. It is very seldom in F1 that I can be on pole and win the race at every grand prix. The team is doing an unbelievable job. The other guys are not getting closer and that is great. My focus is on that.'

Hamilton is asked if he was punished by the team for ignoring a team instruction at the Hungarian Grand Prix... 

'We all get punished for all the incidents,' he replies. 'We have meetings and get a big slap on the wrist. In Hungary I did not say "No" to the situation. I said "if he gets close I would let him by". Afterwards Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe said you made the right choice. As human beings we have the right to question orders and that one wasn’t the right one which the team said so in the meeting.' He laughs, before adding: 'Don’t get too emotional about it.'

2.20pm: Hamilton is asked about his future... 

Eyes on the prize: Rosberg is 29 points ahead of Hamilton in the battle for the Formula One world championship 

'I haven’t said I was freezing anything,' he says after Toto Wolff claimed talks were on hold. 'We are constantly talking with the team. I still have a contract for a whole year on top of this one. I see my future with Mercedes. I am really happy there.'

2.22pm: Rosberg is asked if Mercedes made him apologise: ‘They can’t make me apologise,' is his reponse. 'It was a decision that came from me after hearing people’s opinions. I felt it was my responsibility. What changed? ‘Time’. He replies.

2.27pm: Rosberg is the quizzed on the 'psychological war', and how important it is in the battle for the title... 

'Of course in sport it plays a part. Your performances is linked to many things and your mental state of mind is always important.'

2.30pm: Alonso, Rosberg and Hamilton are asked if the FIA should have taken a closer look at the incident because Rosberg extended his lead in the championship…

ALONSO: I don’t know why I need to answer so many questions. I do not want to answer because I have no clear input. It is FIA rules and they want us to race in a fair way and to respect the rules and they try to do that and if in Spa they did not go any further, they thought it was OK. I was not in that incident, and I was not involved. I have no clear opinion.

ROSBERG: We need to trust the FIA to make the right calls.

HAMILTON: I think the FIA have a really tough job. They have done an exceptional job on majority of calls. The scenarios are always different, so the same rule does not always apply. But I think it is a very good question to be honest because how do we move forward from that? We are always asking to race because it is hard out there to manoeuvre at high speeds without contact, but it is a really good question.
