A mother and daughter were today rescued from their home after a fire ripped through a £4million London mansion undergoing renovations.

More than 70 firefighters tried to 
tackle the blaze on Campden Grove in Kensington, west London, after 
being called at around 6am.

Neighbours told how they were forced to 
flee as smoke poured into their homes and lumps of charred wood and ash 
rained down onto the street below.

After the fire was put out, firefighters at the scene described the three-storey Georgian 
property as 'looking like a chimney' after being gutted by fierce flames.

The owner reportedly arrived back at the property at around 10am and was heard screaming: 'That’s my house'.

At its peak, the smoke was so thick 
that people reported seeing it from as far away as London Heathrow Airport, 
around 13 miles from the fire.

In a neighbouring property, Ronda Challoy and her eight-year-old daughter Arlette had to be
rescued from their garden after their roof caught fire.

Fearing they could not get through the front door because of the ferocity of the flames, they retreated to the rear of the property.

They escaped uninjured after firefighters used a ladder to get them over the dividing fence.

Alasdair Nagle, 51, a private equity 
banker who employs Mrs Challoy as a live-in housekeeper, said: 'They saw
the fire at the front and didn't want to go that way, so they climbed 
over two or three fences to get to a communal garden.

'Then they were the helped over a final wall by the fire crew.'

Meanwhile, Mr Nagle and Mrs Challoy's husband, Alan, made their way out of the front with his two dogs.

Mr Challoy, 39, said: 'The smoke was 
coming in and I thought it was an electrical fault as there was smoke 
coming from the fuse box.

'I had to wake my daughter up as she 
was still sleeping. I was worried about going out of the front because 
the fire was so strong and I was worried the scaffolding would collapse.'

Mr Nagle added: 'The 
fire had taken hold very quickly and was burning strongly. Luckily we managed to get out. We've been told our house has been saved, but there is smoke damage.'

Response: Firefighters had to smash their way into neighbouring properties in a bid to stop the blaze spreading

Mr Nagle said the fire-hit property 
was being renovated from 'top to bottom' by a French couple who had two 
young children. They were not in the house at the time.

He
said: 'The building work has been going on since last September. 
Yesterday, they were burning paint off the outside with some kind of 
stripper.

'They are renovating all three floors, putting in a new basement and a new roof. 'It is costing them a huge amount of money.'

It was also feared that two adults and a baby were still inside one of the other properties, but it is believed they were away.

Speaking at the scene, London Fire Brigade Station Manager Rhodri Horton said the fire had taken hold so quickly the house was left 'looking like a chimney' by the time it was put out.

Firefighters had to smash their way into neighbouring properties in a bid to stop the blaze spreading, he said.

Scene: The fire broke out in Campden Grove, Kensington, just a few hundred yards from Kensington Palace, the home of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

He told MailOnline: 'When the crews arrived, it was already well developed from the basement to the roof.

'They worked to contain the blaze. There has been a bit of spread  to adjacent properties, but there has been very little damage.'

A spokesman for the London Fire 
Brigade said: 'Ten fire engines and 72 firefighters and officers are 
attending a fire at a house under construction on Campden Grove, W8.

'The whole of the three-storey building is alight. Part of the roof of a neighbouring property is also on fire.

'Fire
crews from North Kensington, Kensington, Chelsea, Hammersmith, 
Paddington, Chiswick and Knightsbridge fire stations are at the scene.'
