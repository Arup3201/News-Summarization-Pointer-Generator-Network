Homes bearing the tag of Crescent in their address have topped a list of the most expensive addresses in the capital, new research revealed today.

The historically grand postcodes, home to the likes of Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, cost on average £2,103 per sq/ft in London.

It means a typical Crescent home in London, spread across 2,000sq/ft will cost £4.2million - 25 times the average price of a home sold in England and Wales.

And it is 40 per cent higher than the prime London average, which currently stands at £1,503sq/ft.

A new study has found that Crescents in London top the list of the capital's most expensive addresses. A house recently sold on Wilton Crescent, in Belgravia (pictured) for £32million

Squares, like Grosvenor Square (pictured) secured second spot costing on average £1,807 per sq/ft

In third place addresses bearing the name Mews - which were originally stables or coach houses for servants - claimed third place, costing around £1,705sq/ft. Pictured is Brooks Mews in Westminster

Of the capital's Crescents, the most expensive are Wilton in Belgravia, Hans in Knightsbridge and Pelham in South Kensington - with one home recently selling in Wilton Crescent for a staggering £32million.

Homes located on Squares are the second most expensive, costing £1,807sq/ft, with mews houses - which were originally stables and coach houses for servants - taking third spot at £1,705sq/ft.

Row and Place costing £1,696sq/ft and £1,651sq/ft respectively, complete the top five.

Residents in Gates, Terraces, Walks and Gardens all find themselves above the average London price of £1,503 sq/ft.

But those living on a Road take bottom spot - coming in at £1,236 per sq/ft.

The second lowest is Grove, with Court, Street and Avenue making up the bottom five.

Homes in Rows, similar to Chester Row, Belgravia (pictured), were found to be the fourth most expensive, in the study by estate agents Wetherell

Addresses like Lancaster Gate in Bayswater (left) are worth on average £1,613 per sq/ft while Lancashire Court (right) costs around £1,420sq/ft

Crescent - £2,103 per sq/ft

Square - £1,807

Mews - £1,705

Row - £1,696

Place - £1,651

Gate - £1,613

Terrace - £1,568

Walk - £1,533

Gardens - £1,509

Avenue - £1,491

Street - £1,443

Court - £1,420

Grove - £1.277

Road - £1,236

This is according to research by estate 
agency Wetherell, which analysed 12 months of sales across prime central
 London, one of the world's most expensive place to live.

In total, 2,400 properties were sold during that period, with an average sales price of £1,503 per sq/ft.

Peter Wetherell, managing director of Wetherell, said: 'London's best addresses consolidate their power and value by having the in-built advantage of being dominated by 'sexy address' names.

'Mayfair, for example, has no Roads but lots of attractive squares, places and mews.

'The centre of the capital is dominated by grand crescents, big terraced houses and lovely leafy squares where the wealthy choose to live.

'A report produced under the auspices of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales recently called for planners, architects and developers to focus on designing and delivering more high quality housing based around human-scale Georgian and Victorian era style crescents, squares and parks.

'This call is totally in tune with the findings of our research which indicate that crescents and squares and homes designed around parks and greenery have an enduring asset value and are where people aspire to live.'

Wilton Crescent in London's Belgravia is the most expensive address in the capital, according to new research by Wetherell estate agents

The three most expensive Crescents in London are Wilton in Belgravia, Hans in Knightsbridge and Pelham in South Kensington

One home in Wilton Crescent recently sold for a staggering £32million.

Wilton Crescent was created by Thomas Cundy II, the Grosvenor family Estate surveyor, and was drawn up with the original 1821 Wyatt plan for Belgravia.

It is named after the 2nd Earl of Wilton, second son of the 1st Marquess of Westminster. The street was built in 1825 by William Howard Seth-Smith.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was home to many prominent British politicians, ambassadors and civil servants. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1900–1979) lived at 2 Wilton Crescent for many years.

Today, there is a blue plaque on the house marking it. Like much of Belgravia, Wilton Crescent is characterised by grand terraces with lavish white houses which are built in a crescent shape, many of them with stuccoed balconies, particularly on the southern part of the crescent.

The houses to the north of the crescent are stone clad, and five stories high, and were refaced between 1908 and 1912. Most of the houses had originally been built in the stucco style, but such houses became stone clad during this renovation period. Other houses today have black iron balconies.

Hans Crescent, nestled behind Harrods in Knightsbridge, is the second most expensive crescent in London

A short walk across Sloane Street and nestled behind Harrods is the second most expensive address in London - Hans Crescent, in Knightsbridge.

Further south, Pelham Crescent in South Kensington is the third most expensive of the capital's Crescents.

The circa 1825 Georgian crescent was designed by architect George Basevi, and numbers 1 to 14 and 15 to 27 are separately Grade II* listed.
