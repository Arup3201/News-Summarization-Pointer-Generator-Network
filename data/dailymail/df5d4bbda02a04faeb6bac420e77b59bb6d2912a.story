As the cold weather continues to bite, everyone is looking for ways to reduce their heating bills while staying warm.

And now an ‘intelligent heating system’ that claims to save people 40 per cent on heating costs could help.

Evohome allows users to control their heating room by room using a smartphone app that can even turn the heating on or off if a person forgets to do so in the morning.

The Evohome system creates up to 12 'zones' in the home that can be controlled individually to set different temperatures (pictured). For example, someone might want their living room to be cosier than a little-used spare bedroom

The Evohome device could save a homeowner up to 40 per cent on their heating bills, according to Honeywell.

However, the system is an investment as the hub itself costs £249.

In order to create zones, devices that attach to radiators are needed, which cost £77 each.

One room typically constitutes a zone and would need a radiator device in each space.

So for a house with four zones, there would be an initial outlay of £529.

Someone could use the main device on its own to be able to turn their heating on and off using the app, but to use the 'zone' feature, they would need to invest in the radiator devices.

The system creates up to 12 ‘zones’ in the home that can be controlled individually to set different temperatures. For example, someone might want their living room to be cosier than a little-used spare room.

Zones can be created by attaching a small device to a radiator in a room that 'talks' to the central hub.

The main device even ‘learns’ how a house heats up and cools down so that the system can adapt accordingly. It can react quickly if a window is left open too.

Evohome comes with a free app for iPhones and Android smartphones
 to control zones in the house and allow users to manage 
their heating when they are out.

It has pre-programmed actions such as ‘day off’, ‘economy’ or ‘away’ to change heating settings quickly.

International heating company Honeywell,
 which makes Evohome, claims its smart device can deliver up to 40 per 
cent of savings, by dividing up a home into zones, instead of heating an
 entire house in the same way.

But the device itself, which has a touchscreen and comes in a range of colours costs £249 to start with.

The hub on its own allows users to switch their heating on and off remotely using the app, but to use the 'zone' feature, they would need to invest in radiator devices too, which cost £77 each - and one is needed per 'zone' or room.

According to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) just over 80 per cent of a typical energy bill is attributed to home heating and hot water to the system gives people a good opportunity to save some money by shutting down the heating if while they are out of the house.

‘In the same way you don’t only have one light switch for your entire house, we believe you shouldn’t control your heating with one single switch.’ said Jeremy Peterson, general manager of of Honeywell’s EMEA Home Comfort and Energy Systems division.

‘With the right heating controls in place you really can make your home your perfect comfort zone by setting different temperatures for different rooms, at different times,’ he added.

‘With uncertainty surrounding energy bills and wintery conditions across the UK, we believe it [the system] can help households make real savings on energy bills.’

Honeywell customers with older Evohome products can upgrade their system to include radiator zoning kits from April, which will allow them to control heating in different rooms too.
