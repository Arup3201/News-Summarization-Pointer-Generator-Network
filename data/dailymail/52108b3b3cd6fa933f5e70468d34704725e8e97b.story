He may only be holding a button, but this newborn slow loris is so tiny he looks like he is clutching a gigantic steering wheel.

The big-eyed animal was born at El Paso Zoo, Texas, alongside his twin sister.

The pair are so tiny they each weigh about 25 grams - equivalent to about two tablespoons of white sugar.

Peeking out: Born to El Paso Zoo residents Steven Tyler and Kym Ly, the pair have not yet been named

They are the first offspring for their parents Kym Ly and Steven Tyler - they have not yet been named.

Experts at zoo bred the pair of pygmy slow loris in a bid to boost the primitive species' 
threatened population.

'We are excited about our first birth
 of pygmy slow lorises at the Zoo, especially because they are twins,' said Collections Supervisor Griselda 
Martinez.

'It’s evident that through our staff’s hard work and dedication, this has
 been a successful birth.'

But visitors may have a hard time seeing them in their exhibit because they are nocturnal animals and they may be sleeping in clinging to mom, in their hammock, deep baskets or nest boxes.

Slow lorises are found in south and south-east Asia, including Indonesia, Burma, Singapore, Vietnam and Cambodia.

They live in rainforests and mangrove forests, preferring high dense canopies they can easily travel across.

The creatures are omnivores, eating insects, small birds and reptiles, eggs, fruits and other vegetation.

As a defence mechanism lorises will bite aggressors, producing a toxin to infect the wounds. To humans the bites cause a painful swelling, but the toxin is mild and not fatal.

The single reported case of human death by loris bite was believed to have resulted from prophylactic shock.
