LeBron James may have won plenty of plaudits for the Batman-style mask that he played in on Thursday night, but that didn’t stop the NBA from ordering him to replace it with a clear cover for Saturday night’s game.

The four-time MVP broke his nose playing on February 20 and so took to the court against New York on Thursday wearing a black protective mask that inspired him to score 31 points in a 108-82 victory.

Afterwards the Miami Heat forward got likened to everyone from Batman to Zorro to Darth Vader. The Heat even promoted James black mask T-shirts.

James played in a black mask for the Miami Heat on Thursday' left, after breaking his nose, but was forced to switch to a clear cover on Saturday, right, after complaints that opponents couldn't see his face

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was also a fan of the mask. ‘I like the look of it. It looked kind of menacing,’ he told reporters.

Then on Friday James received word from league officials that they wanted him to instead wear something that would allow opponents to see his face.

'It's not a league rule, but it's the league's request that you don't wear the black one,' James said before Saturday's game.

'The reasons they told me didn't make sense to me, but I'm just a player. I will abide by the request.'

The Miami Heat wasted no time in creating a line of T-shirts promoting James in the black mask

Man in the mask: James scored 20 points to help the Heat earn their seventh consecutive victory, 112-98, against Orlando on Saturday night

Even without his superhero mask, James scored 20 points to help the Heat earn their seventh consecutive victory, 112-98.

Spoelstra said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver spoke Friday with Nick Arison, son of the team owner, about the matter. James said he didn't want to make a big issue of it.

'I'm good with the NBA,' James said with a smile. 'I am not against the NBA. I had a request, and I fulfilled it.'

Teammate Dwyane Wade said he warned James the league would give the black mask a thumbs-down.

Who is the masked man? LeBron James was likened to Batman after he took to the court on Thursday night wearing a black mask to protect his broken nose

'I told him after Thursday's game, "You have fun, because it ain't happening the next game,'" Wade said. 'It was fun. A lot of attention, a lot of T-shirts are going to be made, a lot of Instagram posts. Now we move on to something else.'

James agreed that the black mask was a marketing success, with feedback he received universally positive. He said he may give the mask to charity so it can be auctioned off.

'Everyone loved it,' James said. 'I got stuff, from "You look very menacing," to "You look like a superhero," to "You look amazing." A little bit of everything. No one told me it was terrible.'

Not even league officials.

'I think they loved it as well,' James said.
