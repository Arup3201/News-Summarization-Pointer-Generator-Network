The Obama administration released Khairulla Said Wali Khairkhwa and four other Taliban terror leaders to Qatari officials on May 31 in exchange for the safe return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a man now accused of desertion

In 2011 a federal judge ruled that one of the five Taliban terror leaders traded by the White House for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl nine days ago was too dangerous to consider releasing, even if he had little chance of ever receiving a trial.

The same Obama administration that downplayed the likelihood Khairulla Said Wali Khairkhwa could return to the battlefield against the U.S. argued three years ago that he should be denied habeas corpus rights and kept locked away in an orange jumpsuit at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.

The U.S. solicitor general's office, arguing on behalf of the president – the named defendant in a federal lawsuit – told the court that Khairkhwa was in the class of terrorists who were actively involved in the leadership of a group that killed Americans.

U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina wrote that '[t]he
government contends that the 
petitioner, a former senior Taliban official, is lawfully detained 
because he was part of Taliban forces and purposefully and materially 
supported such forces in hostilities against the United States.'

He was also 'a member of the Taliban's highest governing body, the Supreme Shura,' the judge wrote, and 'was a close associate of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who appointed him Governor of the province of Herat in 1999.'

News of the apparent flip-flop in U.S. policy was reported by The Weekly Standard on its blog.

Habeas corpus rights refer to the legal principle that prohibits the U.S. government from jailing citizens indefinitely without the benefit of a trial to determine their guilt or innocence.

Prisoners of war: 149 detainees are still held at Guantanamo Bay, and the Obama administration may be leveraging Bowe Bergdahl to begin clearing them out

Judges have repeatedly ruled that terrorists seized overseas and never brought into the U.S. aren't entitled to those rights since they can be considered prisoners of war.

The Guantanamo Bay prison camp is located on a U.S. military facility in Cuba.

Forty-three per cent of Americans believe it was wrong of President Obama to release five Taliban leaders in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, while just 34 per cent approve.

A USA TODAY/Pew Research Center poll released Monday found that Americans are split 50-50 on whether to be angry at Bergdahl or sympathetic toward him.

The Idaho native stands accused of deserting his post before he was captured in 2009.

Military veterans pulled no punches with the Pew pollsters.

Just 6 per cent of veterans sympathize with to suspected deserter, and a large 68-16 majority believe Obama made the wrong call.

Indications are mounting that Obama aims to clear out the remaining 149 prisoners there before he leaves office in January 2017, and took advantage of the Bergdahl hostage situation to start the flow of prisoners back to the Middle East.

The president famously promised to close 'Gitmo' in 2008, and signed an executive order on his first day in office directing the Defense Department to shut it down.

But the realities of the War on Terror, along with widespread public opposition to trying global terrorists in American civilian courtrooms, have poured cold water on his plans.

Still, the White House has suggested that once American hostilities end in Afghanistan, Guantanamo prisoners linked to that country's Taliban forces should no longer be held captive.

In 2011 Khairkhwa's taxpayer-funded attorney argued that he was a reluctant Taliban member and a small-potatoes operative.

But Judge Urbina believed the government's evidence that the terror suspect 'had close ties with Mullah Omar,' the Taliban's leader, 'and that he remained one of Mullah Omar's most trusted associates before and after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.'

In 2012 a federal appeals court agreed, dismissing the case.

Khairkhwa was considered by the government to have been 'directly associated' with the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. And according to his detainee assessment at Guantanamo Bay, he was likely associated with al-Qaeda's late leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al Zarqawi.

That assessment also described him as one of the 'major opium drug lords in western Afghanistan.'

Mullah Omar called the hostage swap for Bergdahl a 'big victory' after his comrades were videotaped as free men in Qatar. That country's emir has pledged to keep all five tightly watched and keep them in the country for one year.

Lawmakers in Congress have been critical of Obama's decision to free the men now collectively known as the 'Taliban Five.'

The prize: Armed Taliban fighters took Bergdahl (R) to a rendezvous ponit with U.S. Special Forces for his pickup

Obama appeared May 31 with Bergdahl's parents, triumphantly announcing his safe return in exchange for five prisoners -- one of whom he argued four years ago was too dangerous to release

'Mullah Omar just got his cabinet back,' Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain said Sunday on the CNN program 'State of the Union.'

'What we're doing here is reconstitution of the Taliban government,' McCain warned.

'These are the people who used to take women into the soccer stadium in Kabul and hang them from the goalpost.'

Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC 'This Week' host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that he is 'absolutely certain' at least three of the Taliban leaders traded for Bergdahl will rejoin the Afghan war and fight against Americans.

Despite Obama's announcement that the U.S. war in Afghanistan is winding down, he plans to leave nearly 10,000 troops there through the end of 2015.

'We’ve already seen both in their rhetoric and their actions and, certainly, from the information that we see coming out from the Taliban including the Haqqani network in Pakistan [it] would suggest that’s absolutely going to happen,' Rogers said.

'Maybe not all five, but I do believe three for sure, likely four and that fifth one is on the fence – but will probably play some role in active operations with the Taliban.

'This was the wrong message at the wrong time, and we’re going to pay for this for years,' he added.

Khairulla Khairkhwa was part of the Taliban's highest governing body before the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001

@highlight

In 2011 he sued President Barack Obama, demanding habeas corpus rights that would deny the government to imprison him indefinitely without a trial

The Obama administration argued that he was too dangerous to consider releasing, and a federal judge agreed

Khairkhwa was held at the Guantanamo Bay military detention center until a week ago, when the president released him and four other Taliban leaders

They were swapped for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who has since been accused of being a wartime deserter
