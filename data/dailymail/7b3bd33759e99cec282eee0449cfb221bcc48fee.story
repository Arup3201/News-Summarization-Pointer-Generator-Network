An Ohio fugitive was captured by police after he posted where he was headed for baseball practice on Facebook.

Joey Patterson, 22, was wanted on a felony warrant after he violated his probation in a fraud case in Idaho.

On Saturday Patterson went on the social media site and invited friends to join him for batting practice at the Armory Softball Field in Boise.

Joey Patterson, 22, was captured by police after he posted on Facebook that he planned to practice some baseball batting techniques at the Armory Softball Field in Boise, Ohio 

But instead of hitting the dugout, Patterson ended up in a cell after Caldwell police officers arrived on the field to arrest him, according to KTVB-7. 

He had already been on the run from police for several months before he got caught.

Sgt. Joey Hoadley told the station that police often 'keep a close eye' on social media to track down fugitives.

'Surprisingly, even fugitives can't keep from updating their Facebook status,' he said. 'It leads to some great arrests.'
