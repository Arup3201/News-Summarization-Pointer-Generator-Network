She is one of the world's most provocative pop stars and has already offended the Kremlin after showing her support for Russian punk band Pussy Riot.

Now Madonna could pay the price for interfering with Russian politics, after activists have sued the star for millions of dollars.

Russian activists claim they were offended by her support for gay rights during a recent concert in St. Petersburg, where there is a legal ban on promoting homosexuality to young people.

Anti-gay sentiment is strong in Russia. A law passed in St. Petersburg in February makes it illegal to promote homosexuality to minors.

The author of that law has pointed to the presence of children as young as 12 at Madonna's concert earlier this month, on August 9th.

It was reported that Alexander Pochuyev, a lawyer representing the nine activists, had filed the suit on Friday, against Madonna, the organizer of her concert, and the hall where it was held, asking for damages totaling 333 million rubles, or nearly $10.5 million.

In a response to criticism that the complainants were stuck in the Middle Ages, the lawyer said they were using civilized, modern methods to defend their rights.

He told Russian agency, RIA Novosti: 'No one is burning anyone at the stake or carrying out an Inquisition.

'Modern civilization requires tolerance and respect for different values.'

The complaint includes a video taken at the concert showing Madonna stomping on an Orthodox cross and asking fans to raise their hands to show the pink armbands in support of gays and lesbians that were distributed among the audience.

Earlier the 53-year-old offended the Kremlin with her support for Pussy riot.

Three members of the punk band were sentenced on Friday to two years in prison for a protest outside Moscow's main cathedral against Vladimir Putin and his relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church.

Madonna spoke out in support of the group during her concert in St. Petersburg and two days earlier in Moscow.

After the verdict was issued, Madonna called on 'all those who love freedom to condemn this unjust punishment.'
