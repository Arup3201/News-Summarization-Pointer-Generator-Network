Two Coronation Street stars were caught in bed with two underage girls in a hotel room, it has been claimed.

Police are probing the alleged incident in 2008 and have spoken twice to a witness, who told officers that he saw two actors from the ITV1 soap in a bed at 7am with two girls aged between ten and 12.

The revelation of the Greater Manchester Police investigation comes just days after Michael Le Vell, 48, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster in the soap, was acquitted of child rape charges on Tuesday.

Allegations: Two Coronation Street stars were caught in bed with two underage girls, it was claimed last night

A source close to the witness told The Sun on Sunday: ‘He didn't go to the police at the time because he's not one for fuss. He also moved in showbiz circles and was worried about losing work.’

Officers are now expected to speak to 
hotel staff and look through CCTV footage - after interviewing the 
witness for a second time last Wednesday, the newspaper reported.

A police spokesman told MailOnline: ‘On  September 2, police received a complaint from a third party relating to an alleged incident that took place around five years ago.

'Greater Manchester Police has a duty to investigate all reports that are made to police and enquiries into this complaint are ongoing but are still at a very early stage.'

A Coronation Street spokesman told MailOnline: 'We have no knowledge of this alleged incident.'

Le Vell, who had an eight-day trial, met senior ITV producers on Thursday to discuss whether he will return to Coronation Street.

He has been suspended from the soap for the past two years.

His character, Kevin Webster, last appeared on screen in 2011, before supposedly flying to visit his sick father in Germany.

Bosses are reported to be lining him up for a return to the Street next year.

It would provide a major boost to viewing figures. It is understood Le Vell will be offered a one-year contract, though producers are keen not to sensationalise his sudden return.
