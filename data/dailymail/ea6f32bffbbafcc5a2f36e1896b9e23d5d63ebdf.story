Shakira performs  at the 62nd annual BMI Pop Awards at the Regent Beverly Wilshire in California. Her hit song 'Loca' broke copyright rules according to a New York judge

A hit song performed by pop star Shakira was copied from another songwriter's work, a New York judge  has found.

Shakira's Spanish-language version of Loca, released in 2010, infringed a song by Dominican singer Ramon Arias Vazquez, according to Judge Alvin Hellerstein.

The song went on to sell more than five million copies and topped Billboard Magazine's Latin charts.

It was a collaboration with Dominican rapper Eduard Edwin Bello Pou, known as El Cata – and was widely released as a single around the world.

In a ruling on Tuesday, Judge Hellerstein said that  the hit single had been based on an earlier version of a song recorded by Bello, El Cata, which had been copied from Arias Vasquez's original song.

'There is no dispute that Shakira's version of the song was based on Bello's version,' wrote the judge in his ruling.

'Accordingly, I find that, since Bello had copied Arias, whoever wrote Shakira's version of the song also indirectly copied Arias,' he concluded. 

Ramon Arias Vazquez penned his song Loca con su Tiguere in the 1990s, but Bello denied copying it.

Vasquez says he wrote and recorded the song after his sister had been caught up in a love triangle between a wealthy man  and her boyfriend, a 'Tiguere' — Dominican slang for 'street tough'.

The singer-songwriter said he performed the song for rapper Bello in 2006 or 2007 when they met outside a rehearsal studio in the hope that he would record it.

Loca was a collaboration with Dominican rapper Eduard Edwin Bello Pou, known as El Cata, and he is thought to have stolen the song from Ramon Arias Vazquez

But Bello claimed the song as his own.

He later took the song to Shakira, who reworked it with him and rapper Pitbull, and put it out on her 2010 album 'Sale el Sol.'

Shakira's song was distributed by Sony in both Spanish and English, but the copyright lawsuit mainly focused on the Spanish version.

The English language version of Loca - which featured Dizzee Rascal - was 'not offered into evidence' at the trial.

Neither version of Loca was released as a single in the UK.

Damages have not yet been determined for the plaintiff, Mayimba Music, which holds the rights to Arias' work.

The Colombian singer performed at the World Cup closing ceremony in Rio de Janeiro.
