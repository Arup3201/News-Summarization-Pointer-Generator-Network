Gary Cahill revealed the details of Roy Hodgson's midwinter message emailed to his England players to keep their minds on his plans during void since they were last together.

Hodgson wanted to gather his squad for dinner in January but the plan failed and he was forced to settle for this recorded address dropped into the in-boxes of his players.

'It was in the same format as how we would have a team meeting in here at St George's Park,' said vice-captain Cahill. 'It was a similar thing. It was good, literally the same as we'd do in a team meeting here.

'It was the bullet points of what he wants to drill home as a team and then split off individually, so the defensive unit for me.

'It was sent to our private emails. You put your secret passcode in, then you' re away. I think Roy wanted to have some sort of contact with the squad. It was a good idea and the lads took to it well.'

England met on Monday ahead of a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday and a friendly in Italy on Tuesday, their first games since November, when they beat Scotland and Slovenia.

Chelsea defender Cahill added: 'We re-capped a lot of those things when we met up to refresh our memories about the way we'd been playing. We saw clips of things we did really well and which he hoped we'd do, like winning the ball back quickly which we did well against Scotland.

Cahill spoke about how Hodgson kept his players focused via email in January

'We harassed them and pressed them and won the ball back really quickly, so yes, points like that and points from what he wants to keep drilling into the players that we've been doing since the summer.'

England are already without injured Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana and Hodgson anticipates other players missing the Italy game.

Raheem Sterling is struggling with a toe injury and Leighton Baines has only recently returned to action. Hodgson said: 'I fear we're going to lose a few more.'

'There's one or two that I know won't be able to join us against Italy because of the current problems that they're dealing with at the moment. So on this occasion in particular it won't be as strong a team as I maybe would have liked to put out.'
