Guilty: Conrad O'Donnell stalked his female co-worker while planning her kidnapping in what the judge called 'the stuff of nightmares'

An obsessed salesman spent up to three years secretly building an online ‘shrine’ to a female colleague as part of a sordid plan to drug, kidnap and rape her.

Conrad O’Donnell took the pretty  27-year-old’s keys while her back was turned at work and got copies made so that he could let himself into her flat while she was out.

He would film himself prowling around the victim’s flat where he rifled through her underwear and made copies of her family photos and personal documents, which he stored on his laptop at home.

Yesterday O’Donnell, 29, pleaded guilty to kidnap with intent to rape and was jailed for nine and a half years.

The court was told that O’Donnell also secretly took pictures of the woman’s bottom as they worked together at a shop in Manchester.

His obsession finally emerged when the woman woke up in the night to find him in her bedroom. He thrust a sock in her mouth and said, ‘I want you to come to my house’, before repeatedly punching her.

He only fled when he became shocked at the sight of blood from her facial wounds.

Police later raided O’Donnell’s home 
in Failsworth, Manchester, to uncover the sinister shrine that even 
included her bank statements.

On the day of the attempted 
abduction, O’Donnell had entered Google searches on his mobile phone 
that included, ‘how to kidnap someone’, ‘strongest over-the-counter 
sedative’, ‘how to conduct a lobotomy’ and ‘the best way to gag 
someone’.

After he was arrested, the woman told police: ‘I used to be confident but now I am shy and suffering from depression.’

She said the ordeal had forced her to
postpone an accountancy course and added: ‘This is causing me to lose 
my hair because I see my future that I have worked extremely hard for 
falling apart.’

Passing sentence at Manchester Crown 
Court, Judge Anthony Gee QC told him: ‘The circumstances of what you did
to that poor girl is the stuff of nightmares from which she is still 
suffering. Your victim was vulnerable, asleep and alone in her own flat 
which had been locked.

‘It was an outrageous attack on a vulnerable woman in what should have been the sanctuary of her own home.’

The obsession began after the woman –
referred to in court as Miss X – took a job at a shop where O’Donnell 
had already worked for two years.

Nicoletta Amatino, prosecuting, said:
‘Since the complainant started working at the shop the defendant 
persistently asked her to go out with him. He would often send her text 
messages and would compliment her, telling her she was beautiful.

‘She did not reciprocate his feelings
towards her and ignored his advances. He repeatedly asked her to marry 
him and again she declined.’

In 2010 Miss X began a relationship with another man but jealous O’Donnell told her, ‘he was not the right type of man for her’.

Miss Amatino added: ‘O’Donnell became so possessive he would stand outside the toilet door whilst she was in there at work.

‘She began to feel increasingly 
uncomfortable and tried to avoid O’Donnell, something she feels affected
her relationship with other work colleagues.’

The full extent of O’Donnell’s 
obsession emerged in December last year. She had gone to bed when at 1am
she was woken by the sound of someone unlocking her front door.

Miss Amatino said: ‘She got out of 
bed and switched on the bedroom light to find O’Donnell in her bedroom. 
He then pushed her back and she fell so that she lay on her back on the 
floor. He knelt down beside her and pushed a sock into her mouth.

‘He said, “Stop screaming, shut up, 
stop screaming. If you shut up nothing will happen to you, all I want is
you to come to my house.” He then dragged the complainant across the 
floor and took hold of her arm, picking her up.’

Miss X screamed and O’Donnell punched
her in the face four times at which point he looked shocked and fled 
before surrendering to police.

At his home officers found 80 video clips of Miss X’s bottom and 141 of the victim using the toilet at work.

There were also videos of other females using the same bathroom.

O’Donnell was ordered to sign the sex offender register for life and was banned from contacting the victim indefinitely.
