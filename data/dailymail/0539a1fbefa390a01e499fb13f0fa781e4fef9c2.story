Rob Kearney has cautioned against complacency as Ireland look to back up their defeat of South Africa against Georgia this weekend.

Ireland claimed a surprise 29-15 over the Springboks, who had beaten world champions New Zealand in their prior Test a month earlier.

Georgia proved challenging opposition for Ireland at the 2007 World Cup - Ireland eventually prevailing 14-10 - and that Bordeaux contest has been spoken about this week.

Kearney, who on Tuesday signed a three-year extension to his Irish Rugby Football Union contract to remain at Leinster until June 2018, said: 'Confidence is a brilliant thing and sometimes over-confidence can be a detrimental thing.

'It is key we find the balance there between the two and by no means we get carried away with one victory over a South African team who played poorly on the day and didn't really seem that the defeat hurt them after the game.

'The scalp of getting a southern hemisphere team and the confidence it'll bring to our team as a whole is probably the biggest benefit of the whole thing.

'We are very aware of just what was achieved on the day but by no means losing the run of ourselves and getting ahead of our station.

'I think South Africa played poorly enough and certainly there's a lot of work-ons from our performance too.'

Changes may be required following the Springboks victory, with centre Jared Payne to undergo further assessment on a sprained foot on Wednesday.

Team manager Michael Kearney said: 'Jared is going to have further medical assessment and scans tomorrow.

'We'll know a little bit better after that. At the moment there's no detail on his chances of being fit for either Georgia or Australia.'

It may be Payne is kept in reserve even if he is fit to play Georgia on Sunday.

Hooker Rory Best (calf) and flanker Chris Henry (severe migraine) are unlikely to feature against the Lelos and four players have been added to the Ireland training group in Ulster - centre Darren Cave, Munster back Andrew Conway, Leinster tighthead Tadhg Furlong and Robin Copeland, the Munster back row.

Best has resumed running and could be back to face the Wallabies.

Michael Kearney added: 'It might be more prudent to give him a few more days to recover just to make sure he is right.

'A more realistic target might be Australia but he hasn't been ruled out of Sunday.'

Ireland are determined to carry the momentum from the victory over the Springboks and full-back Rob Kearney expects head coach Joe Schmidt to make tactical alterations to front up to a Georgia side reliant on a fearsome forward pack.

'We have an ability as players to play lots of different types of game plans and we've got a fantastic coaching squad who are able to manipulate a specific type of game plan based on the opposition we are playing,' Rob Kearney added.

'South Africa and Georgia are two very different teams so I would imagine our game plan will vary a little bit.

'They're a good team and they have a huge pack. A lot, if not all of them, are playing Top 14 and Premiership rugby.

'Okay, a lot of their backs are homegrown players, but they do have the potential to be dangerous players.'

Like his full-back, Schmidt will not be satisfied with the South Africa win.

'He's trying to make us winners every single week, to improve our performance on a weekly basis,' Rob Kearney added.

'He's trying to make us that 80-minute plus team, which is something we probably haven't been a lot over the last decade or so.

'It (beating South Africa) gives us that confidence to take on Southern Hemisphere teams.

'That is huge for our mental ability going into a game, knowing we can genuinely compete and beat the best teams in the world.'

The 29-year-old committed his future to Leinster on Tuesday, but had no intention of leaving to play elsewhere.

'It was always a case of staying here,' he said.

'I've no reason to leave. I'm very happy here, I'm part of two fantastic teams.

'I'm playing with all my friends and we're still competing heavily in a lot of competitions so there was never a need for me to consider moving anywhere else.'
