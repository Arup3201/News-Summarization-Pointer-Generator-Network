Most children cannot resist the temptation of a bag of sweets or a packet of crisps.

But while most parents just tell them off if they indulge a little too much, Jack Cooper's parents have had to put him on a lifetime ban of junk food - because he can't stop eating.

Doctors have diagnosed a rare condition - Prader-Willi syndrome - which leaves the five-year-old with an uncontrollable appetite.

Jack Cooper's Prader-Willi syndrome leaves the five-year-old with an insatiable appetite and his mother Alison having to carefully monitor his diet

Mother Alison, 35, can't have snacks in the house, because he'll simply devour them.

And she has to carefully control his calories to prevent him becoming morbidly obese.

Jack, from Hilton, Burton, Staffordshire, never feels full. The condition means he'll simply carry on eating.

Sufferers' obsession with food usually starts between three and five years old.

'Jack is very interested in food and at times needs to be distracted to get off the topic,' said Alison.

'But whatever you give him he will eat, so I have to be very firm.

'We have no snacks whatsoever between meals - never. No crisps, biscuits, cake, chocolate or sweets.'

Jack cannot be trusted to have just one or two sweets - his condition means he will continue eating and eating

She said: 'The doctors were trying to find out what was wrong. I didn't have the early joy of having a new baby. It was a big shock.'

Jack was fed through a tube to try to build up his strength - he weighed in at just 6lb, despite being two weeks overdue.

Experts then noticed he had poor muscle tone as well as undescended testicles.

It was when Jack was a week old that a doctor first mentioned Prader-Willi syndrome.

Alison said: 'I remember thinking "what a ridiculous sounding name". I couldn't believe it.

'When I looked at my baby I saw my beautiful boy.'

She received the diagnosis when Jack was five weeks old, with doctors confirming he had a genetic condition which affects just one in 20,000 people in the UK.

She added: 'As he got older it would affect his appetite so he was at risk of overeating and obesity. He would also be sterile.

'We were in such a massive state of shock.

'As I gave Jack his bottle in the hospital soon after, I was devastated to think that my son would not have children of his own.'

Now Jack has mastered walking confidently he can do the five-minute journey to school without his walking frame. The next challenge is to work on his speech.

Alison said: 'I'm a very optimistic person. I don't think "why me?" - I tend to think "why not?"

'He is my little boy at the end of the day. I'm proud of so much with Jack.'

Alison and Jack are bidding to raise awareness of genetic disorders with the children's charity Genetic Disorders UK and Jeans for Genes Day on Friday, October 5.
