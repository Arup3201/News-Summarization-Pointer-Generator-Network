Their hairy pink tails not yet curled, the swine of piglets sniffed the hay beneath their hooves as they trotted along together. 

Far from the confines of a sty, the animals were making their way through the meat aisle of a French supermarket as part of a farmer's protest against plunging pork prices. 

Blissfully unaware of their role in the political stunt, they perused shelves of lardons and chorizo at the Geant supermarket in St Gregoire near Rennes. 

A swine of piglets was released in a French supermarket as part of a farmers' protest against the dropping price of pork across Europe

Their little ears pricked, the pigs pressed their noses against the freezer and fridge doors as stunned shoppers looked on

They had been released by the farmers' group FDSEA who are campaigning against the lowering price of pork and lack of brands which state where the meat has originated in its packaging.

'The price we're paid for pork is too low, it doesn't allow us to cover our own food and housing costs,' said Damien Legand, a farmer from Parigne, Ille-et-Vilaine.

Adding he and others were 'working at a loss,' he said: '90 per cent of the products in the aisle come from outside France,' he said.

'It's bad for us but also for French buyers.'

Elsewhere, members of Jeunes Agriculteurs carried out similar protests in supermarkets in Brest and Quimper.

'We have the right to demand that the origin of the meat be identified, we have the right to buy meat from France, Italy or Spain but the EU figures aren't high enough,' said Yves-Hervé Mingan, a member of the organisation.

The price of a kilo of pork reached a new low at 1.08 euros on Thursday, with farmers demanding it be raised at least 30 cents immediately.

Paying their respects: The little animals were seen sniffing packets of chorizo and lardons as they shuffled through hay 

Farmers were complaining not enough of the meat on sale in the supermarket clearly stated where it had come from on its outer packaging
