The Americans have a saying about rematches: second time around is a rhubarb.

Mostly, they are right.

Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank — British boxing’s historic precursor to Froch-Groves II at Wembley on Saturday night — came close to filling Old Trafford, but that return bout fell as flat as a cowpat on a muddy field.

Ready to go: Carl Froch and George Groves' rematch takes place at Wembley this Saturday

Occasionally, as with the Thrilla in Manila, our transatlantic cousins will grudgingly concede to a  rematch being a ‘barn-burner’.

Carl Froch took part in one of those when he exacted revenge over Mikkel Kessler a year ago. The 80,000 ticket-buyers for Wembley Stadium and the million projected to pay to watch on Sky will be comforted to know that the Nottingham Cobra expects this one to be even more thrilling. But for the most part, rematches are more bones of contention than nights of high drama. Froch-Groves II is no exception.

The public tend to clamour for second helpings and Groves roared as loudly as the fans for his chance of a second shot at Froch after his somewhat premature stoppage loss in November.

Froch smiles wryly at being ordered by the IBF — whose world super-middleweight title he holds — to oblige his young challenger. The irony is not lost on him that Groves has insisted on deleting from the multi-million-pound contract a clause providing for a third fight in the event that he wins this time.

Froch says: ‘Accidents can happen in the ring but it’s interesting that George won’t offer me another rematch if he gets lucky. And while I’m fighting him again he never gave a second chance to Kenny Anderson.’

Not on: Groves was distraught after his first world title fight with Froch was stopped in Manchester last year

That is a reference to the Commonwealth super-middleweight title fight in 2010 to which Anderson came as a late substitute with a few days’ training.

Anderson shocked Groves with an early knockdown before being stopped in the sixth round. His calls for a rematch with time to prepare went unheeded.

Groves can argue Anderson lapsed into amphetamine use soon after. But that remains the only defeat on the Scot’s 19-fight record; he has since won the British title.

Another fight between them would not have reached the magnitude that is gripping the nation this weekend. Can Froch-Groves II live up to expectations, equal or surpass the excitement of five months ago?

Intense: Both men are confident they will knock the other out at Wembley Stadium

Both men believe so. Groves says: ‘This will be a great fight, even if it is one Carl cannot win in the end. I will knock him out in the third.’

Froch says: ‘George is getting stopped. Probably in the mid-to-late rounds but sooner if he tries to fulfil that early prediction.’

So, come Sunday morning, to which will we be adding Froch-Groves II: the Rhubarbs or the Barn-Burners?

RHUBARBS

Benn-Eubank II -  October 9, 1993, Old Trafford

After
 Eubank’s stoppage of the Dark Destroyer in the first fight, the world’s 
boxing fans had to wait three years for the rematch. Then they flocked 
to Old Trafford  –  to be disappointed.

Only the 12th  and last round 
lived up to the blood and thunder of the original – and only because 
both corners told their man they had to win it. 

Both corners were 
right. It ended in an unsatisfactory draw.

Disappointing: The rematch between Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank finished with a draw in Manchester

Cooper- Ali II – May 21st 1966, Highbury

Our
 ‘Enery had famously floored Cassius Clay at Wembley three years earlier
 with his fabled left hook and only the bell had saved The Greatest.  
Ali took more care in the rematch at Highbury,  waiting for Cooper’s 
fragile eyes to cut again, which inevitably they did.

Easier: Muhammad Ali was prepared for the threat of Henry Cooper in the rematch at Highbury in 1966

Lewis-McCall 11 – February 7, 1997, Las Vegas Hilton

Our
 Lennox had lost his world heavyweight title by a shock 2nd round KO to 
McCall but the American lost his mojo in the intervening two-and-a-half
 years before the rematch.

In the midst of his battles with drug abuse, 
McCall appeared in no fit state to fight – and refused to do so in the 
fourth and fifth rounds, suffering a mental break-down and weeping 
profusely in the ring. The referee had no alternative but to call a halt
 in Lewis’ favour.

Comfortable: Oliver McCall was past his best... the referee had to award the fight to Lennox Lewis

Ali-Frazier II – January 28, 1974, Madison Square Garden, New YorkSmokin’
 Joe had inflicted Ali’s first defeat in the Fight of the Century four 
years earlier. The first re-match in their trilogy was a let-down as Ali
 manoeuvred his way to a staid decision.                     

Tyson-Bruno 11 – March 16th 1996, MGM Grand Garden, Las Vegas

Our
 Frank had rocked Tyson with a huge left in the second round of their 
first fight seven years earlier, before being stopped in the fifth.

But 
Iron Mike had come raging out of prison before the rematch and our Bruno
 had to go back to Vegas to defend his world heavyweight title against 
The Baddest Man on The Planet.

Sadly, a declining Bruno was not up to 
the task, in what proved to be his last fight. He genuflected more than 
30 times on his way to the ring, visibly in a state of nervous 
apprehension, and subsided against the ropes in the third round.

Declining force: Frank Bruno was not up to the task against Mike Tyson in the 1996 rematch in Las Vegas

BARN-BURNERS

ALI-FRAZIER III – October 1st, 1975, Quezon City, Manilla

Although
 the first rematch disappointed, the second was an epic.

Promoter Don 
King’s The Thrilla in Manilla was fought by these bitter foes as if it 
really was a war.

After 14 rounds of extraordinary courage and 
punishment Smokin’ Joe was retired on his stool by trainer Eddie Futch.

It materialised that The Greatest was about to be pulled out by his 
trainer Angelo Dundee and Ali said: ‘This is the closest to death I have
 ever been.’

That's more like it: Ali said it was the closest to death he had ever been after the Thrilla in Manilla with Frazier

HOLYFIELD-BOWE II – November 6th 1993, Caesars Palace, Las Vegas

Big
 Daddy  had won a thunderous first fight, including an unbelievable 10th
 round which is acclaimed as the greatest three minutes in ring history.

Evander The Real Deal reclaimed the world heavyweight title a year 
later in the open-air stadium temporarily erected on the car park at 
Caesars Palace. If anything the second bout in their trilogy was even 
more thrilling and this was rematch of two halves.

Bowe again had 
the best of the early rounds but the fight had to be stopped midway 
through the seventh round as a para-glider calling himself Fan Man 
crash-landed in the ring. Holyfield came back the stronger after a 21 
minute delay to claim an epic decision.

Epic: There was a 21-minute delay in the rematch between Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe

LEONARD-HEARNS II – June 12 1989, Caesars Palace, Las Vegas

Sugar
 Ray had retired since stopping the Hitman eight years earlier, in the 
14th round after being told by trainer Angelo Dundee he was about ‘to 
blow’ the world welterweight title.

Leonard had come back to win the 
super-middleweight title. The championship distance had been reduced to 
12 rounds and another phenomenal fight was declared a draw.

Uproar 
greeted the decision and years later Sugar Ray sportingly told Tommy: 
‘You won that fight.’ROBINSON-LA MOTTA II - February 5, 1943, Detroit

Sugar
 Ray versus the Raging Bull has to be the greatest of all ring 
rivalries. Having won their first fight a year earlier, Robinson found 
himself in an even bigger war in their first re-match.

Probably the most
 gifted boxer in history, Sugar Ray was knocked through the ropes as his
 skills failed to fend off La Motta through a long pounding.

After their
 sixth and last fight La Motta said: ‘I fought Sugar so often I almost 
got diabetes.’WARD-GATTI II and II – 23nd November 2002 and June 7th 2003, Boardwalk Hall and Atlantic City

Irish
 Mickey Ward and Arturo Thunder Gatti fought three times between May 
2002 and June 2003.

Every one was a barn-burner.

The first and third were
 voted Fight of the Year by Ring Magazine and the second would have been
 had it not taken place in the same year as the first.

None were for 
world titles but no-one cared. Ward won a Titanic first. In the second 
he got up from being floored to survive a pounding but lose the 10-round
 decision.

The third saw Gatti flattened, just beat the count and saved 
by the bell before recovering to win.  After each fight both were taken 
to hospital.

Incredible: Arturo Gatti and Micky Ward served up some thrilling matches in the 21st century
