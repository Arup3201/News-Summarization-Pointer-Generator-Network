FEMAIL caught up with the cast to find out the secrets they swear by for staying in shape.

The DVD, which promises to reveal the cast members' secrets to 'looking hot with a hectic lifestyle and how they keep fit when not partying in Chelsea', was a Christmas bestseller.

So why did these four cast members make the cut to showcase their athletic prowess?

'We all love our fitness and go to the gym a lot, so we thought it would be fun,' explains Binky.

The programme features four high-energy 20-minute workouts, one from each of the cast members.

Want bodies like ours? Of course you do! Former flames Lucy and Spencer get sweaty in the DVD

First up is Binky Felstead, who shares her favourite Tabata Wake Up Call Workout - a four-minute intense routine she promises is  fun while it burns lots of calories.

'I used to be a gymphobic,' she said. 'But now I love working out and prefer having a personal trainer so I can get it out of the way first thing in the morning.' 

Meanwhile, Spencer pretends he’s not in pain while working up an energising sweat with a 20-minute High Intensity Interval Training routine, also known as HIIT. 

This routine is designed to work on the abs, arms and legs by alternating periods of short, intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods. Judging from his delighted grin in the campaign shots, he abs-solutely loves it - but that's not what his castmates say.

'Spencer 100 per cent found doing the DVD the hardest because he wasn't in the best shape but he's reached that now,' they said.

Despite Lucy’s claims she’s biologically incapable of sweating, she proves otherwise with her Beach Body Workout that uses just the body's weight without any equipment. 

It focuses on getting all the right bits toned before you put on that bikini or beachwear - something the actress-turned-model knows all about.

And then there's hipster Proudlock, who introduces a special yoga and Pilates-inspired workout called the Chelsea Morning Power Stretch. It not only works on the core but also helps the boyd recover from the more strenuous routines, he said.

'It's really good for those who want to stretch out their muscles,' he said.

The fit four think that toff Mark Francis Vandelli could do with using their DVD the most and say they've all been squeezing in 20-minute sessions daily over the Christmas break. 

The Chelsea clan are currently filming for the latest series, which - quite fittingly - saw Binky dating a personal trainer, Proudlock rocking crucifix earrings, Spencer living up to his lothario status and Lucy getting up in everyone's grill.

So what's on the agenda for 2015? 'I need to pass my driving test, it's my third time,' admitted Binky.

Charitable Proudlock wants to rescue a dog, take up singing lessons, hang out with his family more and be 'more decisive', while Lucy wants to prioritise her friends and family over work. 

The trio also have big plans to develop their personal brands. Proudlock will be adding a womenswear range to his Serge DeNimes line, Binky wants to add skincare and perfume to her Binky London cosmetics range and Lucy plans to develop her jewellery collection further.
