After their longed-for baby was stillborn, Leah and James Mitchell found comfort placing teddy bears on her churchyard grave.

But even that harmless way of easing their grief has brought them more upset – with the church vicar telling them the toys could offend other mourners and ordering  them to be removed.

Now the couple, who married at the same church last year, say they are considering exhuming their daughter Amelia and having her buried elsewhere.

James and Leah Mitchell have made a shrine to their stillborn daughter, Amelia after they were asked to remove tribute from their daughter's grave

Last night Mrs Mitchell, 27, a nursery nurse from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said they were shocked when Reverend John Hamilton rang them when they were on holiday ordering them to move the toys.

She said: ‘We couldn’t believe a vicar could be so cruel. We were in the Lake District and it meant a five-hour journey back.

‘But he said he had a funeral the next day and people would be upset if they saw them.’ Mrs Mitchell and her husband, James, 29, tried for five years to have a child.

But the 20-week scan revealed Amelia had Edwards Syndrome which meant she had multiple disabilities and would be unlikely to be born alive.

Despite being offered a termination, Mrs Mitchell went ahead with the pregnancy and Amelia died shortly before she was born, at 35 weeks, on New Year’s Eve.

Mrs Mitchell said: ‘On Valentine’s Day we placed a big heart on the grave and at Easter we decorated it with bunnies.

'Even though she’d died I wanted to care for her as a mum. We’ve since found out the church has rules forbidding having “toys” on the grave.

‘We used to visit three times a week, but now we only visit Amelia’s grave once a week.’

Mr Hamilton, of St Andrew’s Church in Sherborne St John, Hampshire, said: ‘What Leah and James have gone through is an absolute tragedy.

‘We want to do all we can to help the family grieve for the terrible loss of Amelia, but we must also  be mindful of the environment of the churchyard for all those who come to visit their loved ones  buried here.

‘We are hopeful that we will be able to come to a solution.’
