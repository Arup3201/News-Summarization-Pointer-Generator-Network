Even by their own self-proclaimed standards, this Sunday on Sky Sports had the prospect of being even more Super than normal. A top of the league clash and a Cup Final saw everybody from the channel involved on the day setting their alarms alarming early, and making their way to Wembley.

And it was Neil Ashton who opened proceedings with a special Sunday Supplement from Sky Sports' studio high in the stands. There he welcomed among the guests a new face on the team here, Oliver Holt. 

And early in the discussion, Ollie proved most prophetic in discussing the game that would take place below them later in the afternoon. 

With a cup final and a top league clash it was always likely to be a Super Sunday that lived up to its billing

He acknowledged the Capital One Cup was probably 'bottom of the league for top clubs'. But as he then went on to point out, both ten years and today, for Jose Mourinho and Chelsea 'this competition can act as a catalyst'.

Well, as it turned out, we'll now have the opportunity to find out how that pans out.

Next up it was Goals On Sunday, during which Chris Kamara very nearly scuppered the Super. 

During the show, Kammy managed to wrestle himself away from pitch side with Ben Shephard, and went exploring. 

A very entertaining Paul Robinson then told us about a previous Spurs visit to Wembley under Juande Ramos, before which the usually circumspect boss had arranged a team 'stag do', complete with 'archery, a mock casino... and a shed load of cheese toasties',

During which time Kammy had made his way to the Chelsea dressing room. Here he went on a dizzying tour of the space, where we even got to see the 'tea-making facilities'. So, so far, so good. 

There was even a great chat with Chelsea kit man Gary Grey who explained that John Terry took his captain's duties so seriously, he was like ' a second kit man'. And that Didier Drogba was a fastidious preparer, who would 'stuff his boots with newspaper'. 'The French paper, L'Equipe', added Gary.

Which is where it all started to go wrong. The other guest on the show was Shaun Wright-Phillips, who was also in the dressing room. 

Reluctantly, he found himself being dragged from his seat by Kammy; 'I don't want to ruin my shoes' muttered the poor fella. 

To no avail as they went for an impromptu keepy-uppy session which yielded a best total of one. 'You won't see this quality anywhere else', cried Kammy. You'd struggle to argue with that.

Luckily, though, the always gregarious co-host redeemed himself later when he produced a knife and fork he'd 'borrowed' from the Bobby Moore Suite to present as a gift to Ben. So at least he'd provided some decent service.

The next action came from around 300 miles north of the North Circular with Liverpool welcoming Manchester City to Anfield. 

Another welcome guest was Gary Neville on Sky Sports' co-commentary who, it has to be said, didn't have much nice to say about his neighbours from up the M62. What's more, he carried on not saying it.

As the boys in blue toiled away against the men in red, Gary had no sympathy. 'With the experience they have... I'd be embarrassed', he sighed. 

And he went on, saying it was also 'painful to watch', and that 'I keep seeing the same mistakes being made. (They're) so easy to play against'. Not much Super going on around those parts for Gary, then.

Time to head back to Wembley, where host Simon Thomas and his excellent trio of Jamie Redknapp, Glenn Hoddle and Thierry Henry not only had the run of Wembley, but also a seeming age to fill before kick off.

There also appeared to be a mobile analysis buggy that wouldn't play fair, and a stadium PA system they could probably hear back up at Anfield. It all made for a painful build-up.

Luckily, though, the boys decamped at kick-off to the studio where the day had begun. Where as the game got under way, things started to get back to nudging Super.

All of which was certainly aided at the final whistle by the frequent images we saw of a surprisingly uninhibited Chelsea gaffer, who even managed to take a fall - yet still retain his pride. 

'I've never seen him so happy', said Jamie. Even if on interview he was a little more the familiar Jose. 'Celebrations', he agreed were in order, but 'in 20 minutes, over. Goodbye. Training tomorrow'.

Things were back to normal for the pundits, too. What's more, I think this was also the best we've seen of Henry since his formal arrival at Sky Sports. 

With the insightful experience of Hoddle on one side, and the encouraging cajoling of Jamie on the other, Thierry was sharp, punchy and keen as mustard to talk football. 

With Jamie steering him through from a (thankfully) fully functioning TV monitor, his dissection of Diego Costa's goal was nigh on a masterclass.

'If I'm the striker there', he enthused. 'Happy days!'. Which indeed it was, in the end. Not to mention, even a bit Super.
