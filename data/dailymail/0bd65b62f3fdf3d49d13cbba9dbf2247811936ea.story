Heather Woodfield, 61, (pictured outside the Nursing and Midwifery Council tribunal in Cardiff) failed to seek medical assistance for the unconscious patient

A nurse left an epileptic pensioner unconscious for six hours after she suffered a brain haemorrhage because she thought the patient had experienced a fit and would 'sleep it off', a tribunal heard.

Heather Woodfield, 61, failed to seek medical assistance after the woman was found unresponsive in a wheelchair at Springbank Nursing Home in Barry, South Wales, and instead decided to put her to bed.

However, the patient's condition failed to improve and she died in hospital four days later due to bleeding inside her skull.

Mrs Woodfield, who has been charged with professional misconduct, has now admitted she should have called an ambulance immediately instead of leaving the patient overnight.

Giving evidence to the Nursing and Midwifery Council at a conduct and competence committee in Cardiff yesterday, she said: 'In retrospect, I should have called for a doctor or ambulance straight away. I should not have let it go so long.'

Mrs Woodfield told the hearing she began her night shift at the nursing home at 7.30pm on July 22 last year.

She said: 'The resident was sitting outside in her wheelchair. She was one of those happy people.

'She read the news and liked to tell me what was going on and who had gone in and out of the home.'

The nurse said she later visited the resident during her medication round at 10pm and recalled she seemed 'her usual self'.

However, the panel heard that, about an hour later, health care assistant Lijomol George informed the nurse that she could not rouse the patient.

Mrs Woodfield said: 'I always felt that Lijomol was very timid and shy, so I assumed she was not shouting loudly enough to wake her. 

'I went to her room, but, because of our banter, I was half expecting her to open her eyes and say "fooled you!"'

The nurse said she checked the patient's eyes to see if her pupils were dilated and noticed her leg twitch. She said she believed the resident had suffered an epileptic fit and decided to put her to bed so she could 'sleep it off'.

She told the panel she visited her again at 2am and 5am when she checked her pulse and reflexes. It was when she made another visit at 7am that she realised there was a problem.

She said: 'I raised her arm and it flopped. It was then that I knew my diagnosis was wrong. I realised it was not just a fit and I needed to call the emergency services.'

When asked why she had not called an ambulance immediately, she said: 'I just felt that I had experience of epileptic seizures. I felt I could cope because it was something I had done in the past.

'I felt it was something I was capable of looking after, but I was wrong.'

An inquest heard last year that the patient was taken to Llandough Hospital in the morning, and died there on July 26.

Giving evidence at the misconduct hearing this week, healthcare assistant Ms George said she 'did not understand why Mrs Woodfield did not call a doctor.'

She said: 'I told her I was concerned that the resident was not well as she was not responding to us.'

Ms George said she became concerned for the patient's welfare after she found her apparently asleep in her wheelchair.

She said: 'I had never seen her fall asleep in her wheelchair before. I tried to wake her by calling her name and patting her hands and arms but she did not respond.'

She told the panel she alerted Mrs Woodfield to the incident who lifted the patient's eyelids and said everything looked 'normal'.

The panel heard the nurse subsequently instructed the healthcare assistants to put the resident to bed.

Mrs George said: 'She was lying on her back and she was still unconscious.'

She told the panel she continued to monitor her every 10 to 15 minutes but the resident did not respond when staff called her name or touched her hands.

She said Mrs Woodfield checked on the resident again at 2am and 5.30am but did not call an ambulance.

The panel heard that experienced nurse Eileen Roberts arrived to take over from Mrs Woodfield at 7am and called an ambulance within 10 minutes.

Mrs Roberts, who qualified as a nurse in 1957 and has worked at Springbank for 12 years, said: 'The resident was lying on her back and sweating profusely.

'I spoke to her but there was no reply. She was a heavy sleeper but I was concerned on this occasion as she was not responding in any way.

'I told Mrs Woodfield that I was going to call paramedics and that she needed to stay in the home to tell them what had happened the night before.'

Mrs Woodfield, who was dismissed from her position at the nursing home following the incident, gave evidence to the Nursing and Midwifery Council at a conduct and competence hearing at Temple Court in Cardiff (above)

Mrs Woodfield, who admits three charges against her, including failing to perform and document regular observations and failing to seek medical assistance from a doctor or paramedics when necessary, was dismissed from the nursing home following the incident.

She had been responsible for 34 residents across two floors of the residential home and has since claimed that staffing shortages contributed to her error of judgement.

Tom Watson, operations manager at Springbank Nursing Home which currently houses more than 60 residents aged 65 and over, said: 'It is generally accepted that if a patient does not respond to neurological observation an ambulance should be called immediately.'

At yesterday's hearing, case presenter Henry Vallance said: 'These charges, in my submission, amount to a significant failure to provide basic nursing care.

'They are serious charges that represent a significant departure from the standard that the public expect from the nursing profession.'

Representing Mrs Woodfield, Daniel Neill said she had displayed 'insight' and 'remorse'.

He added: 'She has demonstrated quite clearly to us the remorse that she continues to feel. This has clearly been a traumatic experience for her and one that remains with her.'

Mrs Woodfield has since had an interview to become a nurse at another care home in the area, but has not yet received a formal job offer.

The hearing continues.
