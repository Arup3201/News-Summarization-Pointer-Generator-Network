Killer: Triple killer Ian McLoughlin, pictured, stabbed to death Graham Buck, 66, while allowed out of prison on day release

A triple killer was allowed out on day release, leaving him free to murder a Good Samaritan in a decision today branded a 'catastrophic failure' by the chief inspector of prisons.

Ian McLoughlin stabbed to death Graham Buck, 66, while allowed out from HMP Springhill in Buckinghamshire, where he was serving a 25-year jail term for killing two men he believed were paedophiles.

McLoughlin had travelled to the home of former prisoner and convicted sex offender Francis Cory-Wright in Hertfordshire in July 2013, and filled a pillowcase with cash and family heirlooms in a robbery.

Mr Buck heard his neighbour's screams and went to investigate what was happening, but was dragged inside by McLoughlin, who slashed his throat.

In a report drawn up in January last year but made public today, Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, highlighted a catalogue of failings that allowed McLoughlin to be released.

He said: 'The decision to release Ian McLoughlin had catastrophic consequences.' 

In a highly critical report, Mr Hardwick warned that the system for identifying and managing prisoners released on temporary licence (ROTL) are woefully inadequate.

The number of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences, which are handed out to the most dangerous convicts, and allowed out on day release has increased from 38,000 to more than 90,000 between 2008 and 2012.

But Mr Harding said the systems for managing these offenders in open prisons 'lack clarity and are insufficiently robust'.

He added: 'There is a general presumption in favour of granting ROTL. The purpose of individual releases is not clear, and there are insufficient safeguards to manage the risks presented by some higher-risk-of-harm prisoners.'

Wanted: Ian McLoughlin  met convicted paedophile Francis Cory-Wright, 88, in prison, and during a subsequent manhunt he was last seen at this hotel CCTV, released by police at the time

Attack: McLoughlin burgled convicted sex offender Francis Cory-Wright and neighbour Graham Buck heard his neighbour's screams and was dragged inside by McLoughlin, who slashed his throat

He said protection arrangements 'are not routinely reviewed when prisoners transfer to open prisons' and 'risk assessment processes are inadequate'.

A lack of competence and failures to share information are leading to 'indefensible releases', he added. 

McLoughlin had a history of violent attacks towards men he suspected of paedophilia and had failed to return to prison after being allowed out on day release before.

But despite these warning signs, poor leadership and a failure to properly assess the risk he posed meant officials waved through his day release in July 2013.

The convicted killer failed to return to HMP Springhill while released for the day in December 2010. He went out drinking all day and returned to a man's house where he was found by police called out to reports of two men having a row.

McLoughlin was arrested, but not charged, for being drunk and disorderly and returned to a closed prison.

Yet the following year the Parole Board recommended he was returned to an open prison.

Crime scene: McLoughlin killed Mr Buck at the home of Francis Cory-Wright in the Hertfordshire village of Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted. He was on temporary day release from jail at the time of the murder

Mr Hardwick warned that officials had failed to appreciate McLoughlin's dangerous 'pattern of drinking, identifying single male targets who he believed to be paedophiles and/or homosexuals, returning to their houses, getting involved in an altercation and attacking them'.

Despite these worrying signs, McLoughlin was sent back to an open prison in March 2013.

But his multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) were not properly reviewed on his return, and his new offender manager did not even see him before he was cleared for day release, the report found.

Mr Hardwick concluded: 'It was not appropriate to release Mr McLoughlin for the first time since his previous failure in 2011 for such a lengthy, unaccompanied, unstructured and unmonitored ROTL.

'Mr McLoughlin's custodial behaviour was good and the prison had no security intelligence or concerns about his conduct. However, he presented a concerning risk profile.

'He had previously been convicted of manslaughter and had committed at least one murder. He had failed open conditions twice before. This was his first opportunity to be released on temporary licence since his ROTL failure in 2011. The risks he presented on ROTL were not sufficiently assessed or managed.' 

Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, has been described as ‘astonishingly bright’, with an IQ of 140.

Born in Lancashire in 1958, he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary.

By his early 20s he was a drifter, reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out.

He briefly married at 25, but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution.

In October 1983, he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in London while drunk.

Kept in a cell to sober up, he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him: ‘I’ve done a bad thing.’

McLoughlin had killed a gay man, Len Delgatty, smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel.

At his trial, McLoughlin told the jury that Delgatty, 49, – who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys – had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under-age sex with a teenage boy.

McLoughlin claimed he had ‘panicked’ and repeatedly struck out at Delgatty. He said he had thrown the tape away.

The jury convicted him of manslaughter, not murder, and he was sentenced to 13 years, reduced to eight on appeal. He was released in 1989 after serving only five years.

Just 17 months later he stabbed gay barman Peter Halls, 55, through the neck at his home in Brighton.

In July 1992, he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 25 years.

McLoughlin’s 25-year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a Category D ‘open resettlement prison’ so he could prepare for life outside. 

Assault-rifle wielding thug tried a bank raid while on day release... but was taken by a gang of have-a-go-heroes

Today's report also criticised the decision to allow robber Al-Foday Fofanah out on day release from HMP Ford in West Sussex in July 2013.

While out he used an assault rifle to hold up a bank in Borough High Street, central London.

His raid was foiled when a group of have-a-go-heroes, including an off-duty police officer and an ice cream vendor, intervened.

He was jailed for nine and a half years for attempted robbery and other offences.  

Robbery: Al-Fodday Fofanah brandishes the assault rifle in the Borough Barclays bank branch while out on day release

At the Barclays on July 25 last year, Fofanah joined the queue and waited to be served.

He was carrying a large bag and concealed his face with a sheet of paper.

Al-Fodday Fofanah was apprehended by a host of have-a-go heroes including an ice cream man and a pair of roofers

The customer in front of him was an off-duty police officer - commander Adrian Hanstock from the Safer Transport Command.

When it became his turn to be served, Fofanah pulled a stocking over his face and took an assault rifle from the bag and aimed it at the cashier while demanding money.

Fearing for their lives, a number of customers ran out into the street.

The cashier dived behind the counter as Fofanah waved the weapon at the other cashiers, again demanding cash.

When Fofanah realised no money was forthcoming, he walked out of the bank with the gun in the bag.

Mr Hanstock, who had already left the bank, was confronted with the fleeing suspect and he tried to call for police assistance.

The commander, along with the bank's assistant manager Dean Smith and Michael Duncan - a trainee ambulance driver - followed the suspect along Borough High Street.

Other men joined in and Fofanah was eventually disarmed and held on the ground until police arrived on the scene to arrest him.

It turned out that the weapon was a deactivated assault rifle, classified as an imitation firearm.
