Weston Golf Club in Massachusetts is usually a haven of tranquility and decorum – but the police had to be called when a huge row erupted over members committing the cardinal sin of wearing denim.

At the center of the uproar was the club’s president, Tom Ferry, and British couple Stephen and Charlotte Weeple.

He is said to have directed a barrage of expletive-laden insults at them as they entered the 120-year-old club because he thought they were wearing denim – a material that is outlawed even in designer form.

Weston Golf Club in Massachusetts is usually a haven of tranquility and decorum - but the peace was shattered in September when a row erupted over members wearing jeans

The website of the club, set in Boston’s affluent western suburbs, states that only neat white denim is allowed, and even then only women can wear it.

It says that ‘all denim attire including blue jeans, designer jeans and denim jackets or dresses, regardless of color’ is prohibited. It adds that ‘women may wear neat, not torn, “white denim” or “5 pocket style slacks” in any color (other than blue denim)’.

Mr Weeple, an executive at a Boston finance company, and his wife had arrived for an evening drink with a large group of members who were also accused of violating the dress code, though it’s not clear precisely how.

The verbal altercation between the group and Mr Ferry one Saturday night in September became so heated that the police were called amid reports of a fist fight, according to The Boston Globe.

Rules: Only 'neat white denim' is allowed at Weston Golf Club

Patrolman Joseph Kozowyk said in his report that when he arrived he ‘observed two men… engaged in a loud, verbal argument’. He added that ‘neither man had any signs of a physical altercation’.

The extraordinary incident ended when the Weeples, originally from the Edinburgh area, left the club. However, that was far from the end of the matter.

Mrs Weeple wrote a letter to the club’s board, obtained by the Boston Globe, complaining that Mr Ferry called her derogatory names and denying that she’d broken the dress rules.

She wrote: ‘Having spent much of my life in golf clubs around Scotland and officers’ clubs in the military… I am fully aware and respectful of dress code and etiquette’.

Mr Ferry was so mortified over his behavior that he issued a grovelling apology to The Boston Globe.

He said: ‘I am sorry that the ongoing discord over enforcement of the club’s policies has reached such an embarrassing level. Most importantly I wish to repeat publicly the apology I gave to the people with whom I interacted outside of the club that night. It was wrong of me to have spoken that way, I have no excuse, and I sincerely regret having done so.’

He offered to resign for a month, but he left permanently this month following a petition organized by disgruntled club members over the incident.

Five couples in the club with the Weeples were subsequently suspended for wearing jeans or violating the dress code in other ways.
