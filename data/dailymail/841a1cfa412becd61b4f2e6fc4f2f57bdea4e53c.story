It’s probably not the way I would have wanted to be introduced to Rita Ora – in a packed, noisy club and wearing a bright blue latex gimp mask.

I should quickly explain at this point that this wasn’t one of London’s specialist underground S&M parties - it was Rita’s Superheroes fancy dress bash that I’d been invited to and had decided to go as Captain America.

Rita Ora turned up as Catwoman looking so hot (right now) wearing a skin tight black PVC cat-suit, with her blonde hair swept back tight under PVC cat ears.

The party was at hip new London club Chakana. The place was packed out and everyone in the room went crazy when she arrived. Rita turned up with a good friend of mine Chloe Green and joined us at the back of the VIP room with her entourage dancing on the chairs.

I had been wearing the mask for so long I kind of forgot it was still on when we were introduced. I’m sure I must have made a really good first impression wearing a mask with a big letter A emblazoned on the front.

Rita's stylist, Kyle De’Volle, also came as cat woman and club owner, Nick House, as Indiana Jones

I don’t quite have the physique of the Captain America actor Sebastian Stan at the moment so I chose not to have the full skin-tight body suit - but I’m getting back in great shape again with help of some intensive work outs and some Forza T5 Super Strength supplements, so it’s only a matter of time.

It was about 2am when 10 bottles of Dom Perignon champagne were sent over by our generous host - legendary London club owner Nick House - and the party kicked up yet another gear.

Nick came as Indiana Jones and he’s pictured next to Rita’s stylist Kyle De’Volle - who also came as Catwoman.

You can see me in the pictures dancing on the seats with Nick House’s stunning blonde model/actress girlfriend Kimberly Marren.

She had made her own costume - I can’t remember which super hero it was but she was certainly a supermodel.

Spencer partied till the early hours and was left with a superhero sized hangover

Henry Conway was also at the party - dressed as Flash Gordon and presumably he could put the price of the costume down on his expenses.

Rita left about 3am via the back entrance of the club but the party carried on very late and I had a superhero sized hangover the next day.

Lots of love, Spencer
