Firefighters and other first responders are putting themselves at a serious risk for injury or even death when responding to hybrid and electric car crashes, an industry panel revealed this week.

The danger comes with the increased size of those vehicles’ battery packs and becomes potentially deadly for those dealing with wrecked vehicles. 

Members of SAE International, formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, said in a report that hybrid electric cars must be installed with industry-wide safety measures and warnings so rescue workers know ahead of time what they’re dealing with.

Danger: Hybrid and electric cars are more dangerous after severe crashes because of the risk of electrocution from the battery

Todd Mackintosh, the chairman of the SAE technical committee that led the report, said that it is imperative to develop technology that will help emergency workers as well as the cars’ passengers. 

‘As electric vehicles enter the marketplace in greater numbers, it’s an appropriate time to recognize best practices that facilitate a safe response when these vehicles are in an accident,’ he said in a release.

Included in SAE’s suggestions were switches to switch battery power off, badges on the side and rear of the car identifying that it is a hybrid, as well as lettering on the dashboard.

 Each method would be consistent on all makes and models of hybrid cars, and be visible from 50 feet away – helpful, too, to tow-truck operators who must haul the car away.

‘Think of it as a cheat-sheet for first responders,’ Mr Mackintosh said.

System: SAE recommends that all hybrid and electric vehicles are clearly labeled, visible to emergency workers from 50 feet away

According to USA Today, the influx of hybrid cars on the market within the last decade has led firefighters to fear that they may not be able to quickly identify which cars are fuel-powered alone and which are hybrid. 

‘If badging is visible from 50 feet, visible on all sides and standardized, that can be nothing but a plus for us,’ Buckley Heath, a training officer for the Overland Park, Kansas Fire Department told the paper.

They note that while SAE’s recommendations are not mandatory to carry out, auto makers often follow the organization’s advice.

Last December, the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC) debuted their first responder training program for electric and hybrid cars.

With it, emergency personnel are trained in best practices for electric vehicle accidents, and are taught how to identify electric vehicles from regular fuel-powered ones.
