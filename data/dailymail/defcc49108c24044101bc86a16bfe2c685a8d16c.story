A ninth-grade science teacher is being investigated after pupils in his class found a mini camera hidden under a female student's desk.

Police are examining the camera and computers at the home of Dave McMillen after the shocking discovery in his class at a junior high school.

Police believe the 51-year-old used the camera to take 'upskirt' photos and have launched an investigation into alleged voyeurism.

Science teacher: Police are examining the camera and computers at the home of Dave McMillen after the shocking discovery in his class at a junior high school

McMillen resigned from his job at Selah Junior High School in Selah, Washington, after police launched the investigation.

School officials have given no reason for the teacher's resignation.

McMillen was put on administrative leave earlier this month after students in his ninth grade class reported the hidden camera.

Police said the miniature device was no more than two inches wide. It was discovered by accident when a student knocked it loose.

Chief Stacy Dwarshuis said they are awaiting the results of an analysis of the camera's content.

He also confirmed that computers had been seized from McMillen's home.

Chief Dwarshuis said McMillen had taken the right option by resigning while the investigation continues.

'I'm glad that this gentleman has decided to sever his contract or his contact with the school district. I don't think it precludes him from going someplace else, unless the state steps in and drops his certification'

‘I'm glad that this gentleman has decided to sever his contract or his contact with the school district,’ he said.

‘I don't think it precludes him from going someplace else, unless the state steps in and drops his certification.’

School chiefs sent out an email to parents explaining McMillen had left the school's staff.

The email said: ‘At their meeting last night the Selah School Board approved a settlement agreement with ninth grade science teacher Dave McMillen that provides for his termination of employment by the school district.

‘A temporary substitute teacher has been in that classroom for the past two weeks. Beginning Monday, October 31 a science endorsed teacher will begin teaching the class for the remainder of the school year. ‘

No charges have yet been filed against McMillen.
