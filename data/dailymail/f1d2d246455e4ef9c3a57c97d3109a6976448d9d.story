Home to Gogglebox's 'posh couple', the £3.5million Salutation mansion in Kent is familiar to many as the chintzy pile where Dom and Steph Parker drink in front of the television.

But on Saturday, it was the setting for an altogether different type of entertainment when a schoolfriend of Kate Middleton's held an exclusive, £500-a-ticket, sex party there.

Only the 'sexual elite' were invited to the May Ball organised by the Killing Kittens private club, founded by Emma Sayle, who boarded at Downe House with the future Duchess of Cambridge.

Antiques: Bowls of condoms were laid outside beside the beds at Saturday night's Killing Kittens orgy

Swingers wearing masks and black tie parked their Ferraris and mingled in the seven-bedroom home designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens for champagne and oysters before the evening's real entertainment began.

As the evening wore on, many of the 60 partygoers peeled off their dinner jackets and dresses and slipped into one of the bedrooms, or 'playrooms', to have sex with each other.  The beds were dressed only with sheets, while bowls of condoms were placed nearby.

Those who didn't want to join in the orgy could watch, and the Sun's Jennifer Tippett said one couple had sex on an antique rocking horse while in another room, a grey-haired man wearing just his socks had sex with a woman.

In one twin-bedded room, there were couples on both beds while others leant against antique furniture inches away.

Invited to the sex party by its organiser, Miss Sayle, the reporter stayed for an hour before leaving as the orgy got into full swing.

Set up nine years ago, Killing Kittens describes itself as 'the network for the sexual elite', dedicated to 'the pursuit of female pleasure'.  Membership is for those aged 20-45, while older swingers can become Silver Kittens.

The party at the Parkers' mansion was a Silver Kittens event, and Miss Sayle said the older members needed no encouragement.

'Tonight has got going quite quickly, normally it is around midnight before the action starts,' she said.  'The older crowd are comfortable in their skin.

'You can have loads of young girls who are lacking in confidence even though they are gorgeous, but our silver kittens ooze confidence and have a disposable income, too.'

While alcohol was available, costing £17.40 for two glasses of white wine, red wine was banned to ensure the carpets at the historic home were not stained.

The Parkers, stars of Channel 4's hit show, were not believed to be at home when the orgy took place

Only couples or single women are allowed to attend Killing Kittens parties, with tickets for women going up to £60 per event and couples up to £500.  Masks are mandatory, but swingers are forbidden from taking phones to events to protect people's privacy.

The Grade I-listed Salutation mansion, which the Parkers hire out at £1,700 for a night and also run as an upmarket B&B, is on the market for £3.5million as the Parkers are said to be keen to 'do something different'.

Set within the medieval town of Sandwich, the property has gardens inspired by Gertrude Jekyll, as well as a coach house and three other smaller houses in the grounds.

Neither Mr Parker, 49, nor his 47-year-old wife responded to MailOnline's request for a comment today, but they are believed not to have been present at the weekend's orgy, which was a corporate booking.

No-one at Killing Kittens was available for comment.
