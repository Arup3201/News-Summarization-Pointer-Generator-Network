'Would you like to fly the plane now?' asks the pilot with what I detect is a small chuckle.

I'm just trying to reacquaint myself with our old friend the horizon after coming out of a giant loop-the-loop, 3,000ft above the ground.

I'm sitting in the front of a tiny two-seater plane that is designed to do the kind of acrobatics that put your local circus act to shame.

Behind me at the controls is Datuk Halim Othman, a Malaysian Air Force pilot whose office is often the cockpit of a jet-fighter. He's definitely the Top Gun in this partnership.

So, yes, I think I'll leave the flying bit to you, thanks Halim.

I've been offered this unique opportunity during a trip to the Red Bull Air Race in Rovinj, a beautiful terracotta-topped town on the northern coast of Croatia.

'You must eat a good, solid breakfast. Bacon and eggs,' advised Paul Bonhomme - Britain's Lewis Hamilton of the skies - the previous night.

Easy for you to say, mate. After nibbling my way through some fruit and toast, it's time to head for the hangar.

The RedBull Air Race takes place over several different events throughout the year - the next one will be at Royal Ascot in August - and is a visual spectacle unlike any other.

Combining high speed and low altitude it is a wonder to behold from the ground, as some of the world's most exceptional pilots guide their planes through an aerial racetrack featuring air-filled pylons in the fastest possible time, incurring as few penalties as possible.

Flying low: The race involves aircraft taking on a variety of tight twists and turns as they negotiate a course

The world turns upside down: Mike keeps composed as the Red Bull jet performs a stomach-churning 360 degree loop above Croatia

The safety
 briefing I receive is pretty straightforward: keep your eyes on the horizon, 
tense your body when the G-Force hits you and please don't be sick in 
the cockpit (there's a bag on the side if the worst happens).

As
 we walk to the plane (an Extra 330 LX, for any of you reading this with
 a pilot’s licence), I try to avoid looking at the bloke from Austria 
who flew before me and is now slumped on a sofa with a face that is 
roughly the same shade as a Granny Smith apple.

Fitted in a flight suit with a parachute on my back, I pull on the helmet through which I can also hear Halim dish out advice. I suddenly feel rather small as the canopy is closed above our heads.

'Flight No 4, please taxi to the runway for take off.' 

There's no going back now.

Acrobatics: The planes perform the stunts at low altitudes so the crowds can watch from below

We’re off the ground in just a few seconds and soon rising sharply to the left above the emerald waters of the Adriatic.

In the distance - eyes fixed firmly on the horizon - I spot the uncompromising racecourse for the pros. I may have dodged that, but I'm about to have a small taste of what they do.

'Enjoying the view?' asks Hamil.

'Yes.'

'Ready for some moves?'

'Erm, I think s...'

Before I've had time to add the 'o', we dive down sharply towards the trees below. It's loop-the-loop time.

What is the Red Bull Air Race?It is a world championship that was launched in 2005. Pilots race specially-designed planes through and around air-filled pylons on a course. Whoever finishes in the quickest time wins, with points for all those in the top eight.Where can I watch it?It's a global event, with this season's races being staged in Abu Dhabi, Croatia, Malaysia, Poland, China and two in the United States (Las Vegas and Dallas). Closer to home, the race comes to Ascot racecourse in Surrey. Qualifying is on August 16, with the race on the following day.Who races in the championship?There are 12 pilots in the world championship, including two Brits - world champion Paul Bonhomme and Nigel Lamb. There is also a Challenger Cup series for up and coming pilots, with 29-year-old Brit Tom Bennett tipped for big things.Is it dangerous?Like Formula One, there will always be dangers with super-quick racing, but the emphasis is very much on safety first. The world championship had a three-year hiatus as technical and safety rules were tightened, before returning this year.What do the pilots do when they are not racing?All the pilots come from commercial or military backgrounds. Bonhomme - champion in 2009 and 2010 - flies Boeing 747s for British Airways in his day job.For more details and tickets to Ascot on August 16-17, go to www.ascot.co.uk/airrace

Thrilling: Several competitions are held throughout the world over the course of the year

Ready for take-off: Mike Anstead gives a thumbs-up to the camera before taking to the skies for his acrobatics

'Strain' warns Hamil.

He then lifts the plane's nose upwards so all we have in front of us is cloud. The G-Force kicks in - I get the feel of four Gs (the pros experience 10 when they loop in the races - 'it's like being sat on by an elephant' is Bonhomme's verdict).

It's an amazing sensation as gravity pins me back in my seat. Keeping my eyes locked ahead, a few seconds later the water and then the trees come back into my now deranged view. It's like someone's turned the world inside out inside my head.

After another loop-the-loop (why not?), 
Hamil switches to a barrel-roll - tipping the plane to the right and 
turning it 360 degrees until it's back level again. The manoeuvre turns 
the land below into a distorted ball of trees. It's the first time my 
stomach rings the doorbell to ask what's going on.

He survived!: Mike gives crew another thumbs-up as he lands safely back on land after his daredevil ride

'More barrel-rolls?' asks Hamil. 

'I think one's enough fella...'

He winds the plane down and down in a series of sharp left turns before blasting forward at 200mph just 25m off the ground through a set of air-filled pylons like those used on the real course. 

Two days later, I watch on from my standpoint on the bay of Rovinj as Bonhomme misses out on winning the final by 0.08s. I have a new-found respect for these daredevils in the sky.

You can do the same at Ascot next month. And with your feet firmly on the ground, you won't have to worry about keeping your eyes on the horizon.
