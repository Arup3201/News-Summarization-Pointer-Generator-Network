A stunning luxury boat has combined the worlds of marine and aviation design by using an engine that originally powered an iconic British warplane.

The £3million Aeroboat is propelled by a reconditioned, waterproofed 27-litre Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engine.

It’s the same engine that fitted to Britain’s Spitfire fighter plane during the Second World War. The aircraft also provided styling inspiration for the boat.

The £3million Aeroboat is propelled by a reconditioned, waterproofed 27-litre Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engine - the engine used in the RAF Spitfire

The Spitfire symbolises the Battle of Britain and has an aura of mystique in the world of aviation

Just 10 Aeroboats with 1,100 horsepower on tap, able to propel the vessel to a top speed of between 75 and 95 knots, or 86-109 miles per hour, have been built.

The vessel was created by Hampshire-based yacht design studio Claydon Reeves.

The boat is sculpted in carbon fiber Kevlar and lightweight wood veneer to keep the weight down and ensure it rides the waves with ease.

Each of the reconditioned Aeroboat engines will come with 'documented provenance' of its history.

Soaring: With 1,100 horsepower on tap, the vessel can hit a top speed of between 75 and 95 knots, or 86-109 miles per hour

Interior: The plush fittings in the Aeroboat are a far cry from the stark functionality of the Spitfire's cockpit

Beam: 2.98m

Max draft: 1.14m

Weight: 7700kg

'It is perfect for anyone wanting to breakfast in St Tropez, lunch in Antibes and dine at night in Monaco.

'Inspired by the sleek lines of the famous Spitfire fighter, from the stern and sweeping tail echoing the wing’s trailing edge to the authentic air intake scoop, the Aeroboat’s throttle and switchgear design is aircraft-inspired and the shock-mounted forward seats are a nod to the Spitfire’s own landing gear.'

It also features aircraft-inspired switchgear and shock-mounted seats into its long, sleek form.

Salute to Style is a celebration of speed on water, air and road tpo be held at London”s Hurlingham Club between July 16 and 19.

The Aeroboat will be built to customer specifications with every element of its interior design, from the cockpit to trim, engine specifications and exterior finishes, configured to suit its owner.
