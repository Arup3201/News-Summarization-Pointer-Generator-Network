A corrupt policewoman has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for stealing thousands of road crash victims' details and selling them to compensation lawyers.

Sugra Hanif, 27, from Banbury in Oxfordshire, was branded 'a disgrace to her uniform' for stealing details from a Thames Valley Police computer for her married lover Raza Khan, 27 to sell on.

Today Hanif and Khan were each jailed for three years at Winchester Crown Court for a scam that could have made the pair up to £1million in referral fees had they not been caught.

As part of the scam, Hanif - a former 
officer with Thames Valley Police - would access the Police National 
Computer and make notes of personal information from people involved in 
car crashes.

It is believed they accessed 2,456 files in total.

She
 and her former lover Khan, from Handsworth in Birmingham, would then 
make phone calls pressuring the victims into making accident claims with
 no-win no-fee legal firms.

Crime: Hanif would access police computers and steal personal information from road crash victims

Each
 referral would earn Khan’s fledgling accident claim management business
 SR Auto Repairs between £700 pounds and £800 pounds.

Before the conspiracy was detected in December 2011, Khan earned around £26,400 in only seven months.

Prosecutors estimated the pair stood to have made more than £1million pounds if they had not been caught.

Jailing
 the pair at Winchester Crown Court today, Judge Andrew Barnett said: 
'It is a serious undermining of the public’s confidence, and that gross 
breach of trust, Hanif, is something for which you in the main are 
responsible.'

'You have 
behaved in an appalling fashion. Bearing in mind the trust imposed on 
you by the public and those who employ you. You are a disgrace to the 
uniform you once wore.'

'You have let down the police service; you have let down your colleagues because their reputation has been tarnished.'

The
 court heard Thames Valley Police could face a fine of around £500,000 
pounds from the information commissioner because of the data breach, 
which was said to be unprecedented.

Some 5,000 members of the public could also take individual legal action against the force, the sentencing hearing was told.

Hanif was sacked by Thames Valley Police after she was convicted earlier this month, following a seven-week trial.

She
 had been having a extra-marital affair with Khan and claimed had been 
pressured into obtaining the data by him after he threatened to tell her
 devout Muslim father about their relationship.

She also claimed to have been 'infatuated' with Khan at the time.

However,
 this was denied by Khan, who the court heard had been previously jailed
 for 42 months in 2008 for causing death by dangerous driving.

He also had a number of other convictions for violent offences going back to 2002.

Khan's
 wife Paramjeet Kaur, 26, had also been charged with conspiracy to 
commit misconduct in a public office. However, she was acquitted after 
the jury failed to reach a verdict against her.
