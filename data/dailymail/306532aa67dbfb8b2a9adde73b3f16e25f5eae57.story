Police say the investigation into Saturday night's incident is ongoing and is being called a homicide, but no arrests have been made, according to ESPN.

The running back posted a picture on Instagram in the hours before he was shot, saying that he was getting ready for a show by his friend, a rapper who was performing at LUX in downtown Orlando.

Johnson is set to become a free agent on Tuesday after ending his contract with the Jets.

His former team declined to pick up its option for the player after a frustrating season with below average carry and yardage totals.
