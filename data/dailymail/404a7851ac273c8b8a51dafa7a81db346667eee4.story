The boss of the National Health Service has said he will be ‘disappointed’ if nursing homes still exist in 50 years’ time.

Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said that he believes better community care and advances in dementia research can be used to help people stay in their homes.

It follows public concern about the treatment of the elderly in some care homes in recent years.

Care homes will come to be seen as a quirk of the health service at the end of the last century, Simon Stevens argued

Mr Stevens likened the concept of care homes to TB beds, where patients were consigned on wards to be treated with the deadly disease.

A combination of technology, more social support and family help means care homes will become seen as a 'particular feature' of the end of the last century. 

Speaking at Age UK’s For Later Life conference he said: ‘We need to do a better job of keeping out of care homes. Each year about 90,000 people who live at home are admitted to hospital and then are discharged to a care home.

‘Some of those folks clearly will need to be supported in a care home, but probably many could be supported at home.

‘It would be a disappointment if in 30, 40 or 50 years’ time nursing homes still exist. I think we may find that nursing homes are a bit like TB beds were, they were particularly feature of the way care was provided in the latter part of the 20th century.

‘The combination of team-working, technology, and better social support, I hope means that they go the same way over time.

‘When you think about where we are trying to get to with the treating and preventing of Alzheimer’s, it is perfectly imaginable that in 50 years’ time we have a world where there is very little in the way of Alzheimer’s. There is a huge research effort internationally.’

Mr Stevens, who took up his role earlier this year, added: ‘We need to think about new ways of supporting people at home. 

'We know that the vast majority of people would prefer to be supported in their own homes for as long as possible and continue to be an active part of their communities. 

'But often the trend has been pushing in the opposite direction.

‘Something is not working right about how we are providing community nursing and primary care for people at home and the consequence of that is people finding themselves admitted to hospital when we could otherwise avoid that.’

Mr Stevens added that he wanted the term ‘bed blocker’ to be banned in the NHS. 

He said: ‘We’ve got to tackle ageism. We need to think about the labels that used. The idea that somebody that is stuck in a hospital bed waiting to get home is described as a bed-blocker is offensive and should end.’

In future patients will be treated closer to where they live, he argued. ‘The NHS of the future will be one where more support for frail older patients is provided locally, but where for really major conditions, patients get quick access to centres of excellence. We need both, not either/or.

‘This reminds us that healthcare is constantly changing and the NHS needs to adapt with it. Sometimes we need to centralise in order to save lives, at other times we need to make services more local to meet the needs of patients.’
