A survivor of the devastating Maine fire that tore through a home after a Halloween party has paid tribute to three of the five victims in a choking, guilt-ridden tribute.

Nathan Long woke up to the smell of smoke at around 7am in the two-apartment building.

By then the blaze - thought to be the worst in Maine for 30 years - was so ferocious he was forced to jump to safety from his window.

Today he paid tribute to his flatmates David Bragdon Jr, Ashley Thomas and Nikki Finlay in a heart-rending Facebook post that read: 'The smoke was coming so fast, … so intense. ... The fact I didn't have one minute to kick in doors and save you will eat at me for the rest of my life.'

Bragdon's father, David Bragdon Sr, confirmed his 27-year-old son, a waiter at the Great Lost Bear restaurant nearby, is among the victims killed on Saturday morning.

He says his son lived in the home and  hasn't been heard from since the fire.

Bragdon, his eyes filling with tears, talked to reporters outside the house, saying: 'Is it true? Is it real? It's hard not knowing 100 per cent.'

Kevin Bragdon, 20, on Saturday described his brother as a 'kind-hearted person. He would give you the shirt right off his back,' the Portland Press Herald reported. 

Ashley Thomas was a photographer for the wedding and lifestyle image firm she set up with her boyfriend of seven years, Mat Garber, called Mat & Ash Photography. 

Garber today posted a picture of the couple together, which has received numerous comments and tributes.

Nikki Finlay had recently taken up a job at a local cafe and play center Greenlight Studios.

'Beautiful soul': Nikki Finlay's new employers posted their grief on Facebook calling her a 'beautiful soul'

The center posted on Facebook: 'It has been confirmed that a beautiful soul, Nikki Finlay perished in the fire on Noyes St. R.I.P Nikki, you brought joy to many.'

The fire swept through a two-apartment building near the University of Southern Maine's commuter campus, completely gutting the two-story structure after a Halloween party.

It was reported at 7:17 a.m. on Saturday morning in Portland Maine. 

But it remains unclear if any of the victims were students and police are trying to find out more information about those who died. 

The fire is being described as Maine's deadliest fire in the past 30 years. 

Search: Investigators spent hours extinguishing the blaze that tore through the two-apartment building

Questions: One person managed to jump from a window but it is not known who the five victims are

Devastation: The fire which was reported at 7am on Saturday is thought to be the worst in Maine for 30 years

State fire marshals' spokesman Steve McCausland said: 'We do not know whether the victims are residents of the home or guests.'

Initial reports suggested that the victims were students but McCausland later said they weren't.

Portland Fire Chief Jerry LaMoria also said he didn't know if any of the victims were students.

It was first thought that several people were unaccounted for after the fire, but by later in the day, authorities were unsure how many, if any, were still missing.

One person suffered severe burns and jumped from a second-story window. 

He was reported in critical condition in the burn unit of a Boston hospital, McCausland said.

A second person was treated and released from a hospital and seven people escaped from the burning building.

Meanwhile, two bodies were found on the second floor and two others on the third floor.

From the outside, one side of the building looked severely damaged by flames.

Flames could be seen shooting out of the roof at the height of the fire and local residents surrounded the scene.

Smell of smoke: Nathan Long, who escaped the blaze, said he woke to the smell of smoke when his alarm went

Tears: Neighbors who believe their friend was one of the victims cry outside the house on Saturday morning

Nathan Long, escaped the blaze, and said he woke up to the smell of smoke when his alarm clock went off.

He told the Portland Press Herald that he didn't hear any fire alarms going off.

He yelled 'fire!' and ran to the back of the house, where another person was opening a window.

They both jumped onto a porch roof, then to the ground, where he saw the badly burned body of another person.

'I feel pretty lucky. I'm kind of numb,' Long told the newspaper.

He said he lived with four other people and that he didn't know the fate of his roommates beyond the one with whom he escaped.
