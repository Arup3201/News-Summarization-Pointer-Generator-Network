She is known as much for her mane of golden hair as her never-ending legs.

But Jerry Hall has gone for the ultimate chop, cutting off the most of her thick, tumbling waves in favour of a fresh, modern shoulder-length style.

The legendary supermodel, 57, has had the same long hairstyle throughout her 40-year career - until today.

Jerry, mother to supermodel Georgia May, posted a photo on Twitter with the message: '#Surprise !! .. I have cut off my long locks and got the short “Lob” haircut. Thanks to the @lorealpro team!'

A spokesperson has told MailOnline: 'It wasn’t planned. [Jerry] made an impulsive decision during a photo shoot with L’Oréal Professionnel.'

Actress and model Loan Chabanol also had a hair makeover with L'Oréal.

She posted a picture of her with Jerry with the caption: 'With legendary Jerry Hall on set for L'Oreal Professionnel. Thank you to #lorealprofessionnel for choosing us as your "It Girls" #jerryhall'.

Jerry has said of her hair style: 'My mother and my sisters - five girls - were crazy about glamour and Hollywood movies. I styled myself on Veronica Lake and Marlene Dietrich.'

As she approaches her 60th birthday, Jerry is toning down the glam with her elegant new look.
