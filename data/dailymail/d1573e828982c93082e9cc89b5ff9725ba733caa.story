Martin Keown has accused Erik Lamela of being self-indulgent after his spectacular rabona goal against Astera Tripoli in the Europa League.

Lamela scored what some experts have called one of the finest goals ever seen at White Hart Lane.

Lamela wrapped his left foot around his right leg to score with a rabona strike from the edge of the box - a goal any of the greats to don the lilywhite shirt would have been proud of.

And while Keown acknowledged the technique required to score a goal like that, he questioned what would have happened if he mistimed it.

'Fantastic skill,’ the former Arsenal defender and now Sportsmail columnist told the BBC’s Football Focus.

But he added: 'I think that's a major self-indulgence to do something like that.

'If it comes off then great but if it doesn't... And if you're watching him play regularly he does overplay a little bit.

'But when he gets the balance right there's definitely a special player there.'
