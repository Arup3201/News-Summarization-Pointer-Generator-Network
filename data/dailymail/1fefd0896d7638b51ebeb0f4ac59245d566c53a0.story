You'd be excused for thinking the willingness to brave a vast expanse of snow and ice, and a fair degree of danger, would be a prerequisite for spending the night with a polar bear.

But not in France's Loire Valley, where you can not only share the same space as the giant carnivores but enjoy a glass of champagne and gourmet dinner by a log fire while doing so.

Visitors to the La Fleche Zoo's polar bear lodge pay from £157 ($246) per night to stay in the three-star accommodation with large bay windows looking onto the enclosure polar bears Taiko and Katinka call home.

The bears can, and do, come right up to the glass of each of the eight lodges, which are a world away from the Arctic Circle origin of the creatures.

The 'A night at home with the bear' concept was launched in October this year - though the 68-year-old zoo has had accommodation since 2013 - and such is the interest the western France zoo says it has the rooms sold until the end of 2015.

The rooms are based on arctic lodges, and with capacity for six people work out at 200 euros per person person per night.

The lodges have proven such a success that six more are set to be open by 2016, with an African savannah-themed equivalent to follow.

Sleeping with animals is a growing trend around the world for zoos looking for ways to stay afloat.

While London and Los Angeles' zoos have met success hosting night-time parties at their parks, staying the night in luxury takes a visit to a whole other level.

On Friday, the National Zoo and Aquarium in Australia's capital Canberra opened a new resort which allows guests to have a bubble bath next to bears and sleep with sharks just a glass panel away.

Guests staying in one of the Jamala Wildlife Lodge's 20 luxury rooms can also dine with lions and hand-feed giraffes from a treehouse. Its Ushaka Lodge surrounds a monkey facility and an aquarium, with access to feeding the sharks.

Back in France, La Fleche isn't alone in offering visitors close-up encounters in resort-style comfort.

Sainte-Croix has an 18-month wait to stay in its deluxe wolf lodge while Cerza's resort is also a hit. 

Each room can sleep six people with bookings all full until the end of 2015

Sophie Huberson, from France's national union of leisure, amusement and cultural spaces, says each zoo that has introduced lodges on site have increased their revenue.

'They'll all end up following this model, which lets them increase their capacity to invest,' she said. 'Those which don't evolve will see their visitor numbers drop.'

Northern France's Beauval, the country's most successful zoo, has two hotels outside the park - the first being built in 2008 - and will open a third in 2015. That will have a China theme in tribute to their resident pandas and take their overall capacity to 900 rooms.

'They told us it wouldn't work,' said managing director Rodolphe Delordhe. 'Today, people are spending their holidays here.'
