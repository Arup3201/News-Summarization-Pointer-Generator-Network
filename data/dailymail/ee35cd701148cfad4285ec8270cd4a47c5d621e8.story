This creative teacher has taken recycling to a whole new level by creating scale replicas of cars from old beer and coke cans.

Sandy Sanderson, who lives in Hamilton, New Zealand, has been creating vehicles from aluminium cans for eight years.

The colourful branding on the well-known cans forms the paintwork of hot rods, roadsters and other classic cars and even the steering wheels and headlights are painstakingly recreated. 

Detail: Some of the cars, like this buggy, took 30 cans to create although it looks as though it used less

Cola: The bright yellow branding of this can forms a brilliant paintwork for the model

Hot rod: The raised engine was another detail that brought this classic car to life

Beer can: The flimsy aluminium is painstakingly bent into shape to create the bodywork of the car

Mr Sanderson, who moved to New Zealand from England, originally trained as a draughtsman before retraining as a technology teacher.

After he emigrated, he became interested in creating scale models of aircraft, classic cars and bikes from kits.

A keen bass player, it was when he got to 40 years old while he was designing and building string instruments, that he had an accident and shattered his left wrist.

His dreams of becoming a full-time instrument repairman were halted but it was while he was recovering he came up with idea.

Grille: The corrugated grille on this model is created perfectly from tiny strips of the lager can

Can cars: Sandy Sanderson has created these mini masterpieces from what some people would throw away

Labour of love: Mr Sanderson has been creating these cars since he had an accident eight years ago

Even the ring pull is used on this car as Mr Sanderson said he got the idea while recovering from an accident

Scale: The model even has a tiny steering wheel and miniature dashboard dials

He stopped throwing away the recyclable cans and started experimenting.

He'd seen model aircraft built from cans before, but only using the plain interior aluminum.

So he expanded upon the idea and built his first car in 2006, the Coruba Climax, made from 8 Coruba & Cola cans.

He's since built a number of incredible 'Can Cars', each individually designed with care and amazing attention to detail.

Branding: The writing on the outside of a Guinness can is still visible in the interior of the model car

First car: Mr Sanderson built his first car in 2006, the Coruba Climax, made from 8 Coruba & Cola cans

Coca Cola: This buggy has a speedo and a set of pedals as well as a tiny handbrake all made from the can

Vehicles include classics such as the Roadster, Jeep and Moke and are made from such classically designed cans as Coca Cola, 7-Up, Heineken and Guinness, among others.

Each vehicle can take up to 30 cans, like the Waikato Buggy, to manufacture. The CanCars are available for purchase or, for the adventurous, plans are available to build your own version of Sandy's CanCars.

Writing on his website, Mr Sanderson said: 'I have always religiously recycled but often spent time looking at the graphics on the can and looking at the shape of the bottom thinking "That could make a really cool wheel".

'I decided to put pencil to paper and try and make a racing car using the bottoms of cans as its wheels, and the graphics as the decoration for the body.

Windows: This hot rod even has the standard red brake lights and circular windows in the back

Mr Sanderson had model aircraft built from cans before, but only using the plain interior aluminum

Classics: Vehicles include such classics as the Roadster, Jeep and Moke and are made from several cans

He's since built a number of incredible 'Can Cars', each designed with care and attention to detail

'During the design stage, but more importantly during the construction, great care must be taken to ensure that the graphics on the can match up from one panel to the next. For what may appear to be just one can moving across a bonnet and down around a mudguard there could actually be five or six  cans used to create that effect.

'Some of the cars have required over 30 cans for their construction.

'Due to the cans being as thin as a piece of paper, a wooden inner structure had to be made to support the flimsy shell before carefully cutting and creasing the panels to shape.

'Other materials used include superglue, galvanised wire, electrical cable, tiny nuts and bolts, and washers, aluminium tubing and a few pins from a sewing kit.

Sandy Sanderson started designing the cars when he shattered his wrist in an accident and couldn't work

Mr Sanderson said: 'I have always religiously recycled but often spent time looking at the graphics on the can'

Although these are not models of real cars, the size of them would put them at about 1:10 scale

'The small details that can be included really do add enormously to the effect.

'Although these are not models of real cars, the size of them would put them at about 1:10 scale. They do not have any working features, just nice to look at.'
