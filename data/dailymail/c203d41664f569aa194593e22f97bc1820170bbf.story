A four-year-old boy is taking the world of golf by storm with his instinctual ability to drive, chip and putt at a level far exceeding his age.

James Grimes, from Louisiana, was playing with plastic clubs before he could even walk. Now he is fast establishing himself as a golfing prodigy.

After first taking on lessons at the age of two, he now practices up to six times a week and plays in competitions against eight and nine-year-old children.

His mother Nicole Grimes said: 'He started with plastic clubs when he was about 15 months old. He was crawling around the house hitting the balls – even before he was walking.'

Mrs Grimes and her husband James  Grimes Sr didn't think the early fascination with golf would turn into anything special, even though their son - who was still in diapers - would putt across the house losing dozens of golf balls under sofas, chairs, and TV stands.

'Right when we got him real clubs, he started teeing off balls from the tee – immediately,' Mrs Grimes said. 'He was making contact with every ball, I mean it was amazing.'

When James was just two, the Grimes decided to book him for golf lessons.

Mrs Grimes said: 'I contacted golf pro, Michael Watts, at Addis Springs Golf Course – where he plays. He took him out for the first time and couldn't believe how he was immediately making contact.'

His instructor put a blanket out in front of him and was astounded that Baby James was able to hit every ball off the tee and make it onto the blanket – which was 50 yards away.

'He didn't know what to expect when I called him and said: "Can you take someone this young?"

'The first time on the course he was chipping in the air – and putting was natural for him. Michael told me that day – you really need to keep him in this!'

James has had his real golf clubs for more than a year now.

He plays a nine hole round once or twice a week, and practices at the course 4 days a week.

Mrs Grimes said: 'Honestly, James will practice 6 days a week. It's rare he will take a day off. I have to tell him, 'We're taking this day off.'

James' inspiration came from professional golfers Phil Mickelson and Rory McIlroy, and said his favourite part of the game was 'chipping and putting'.

Mrs Grimes added: 'His putting is what amazes everyone. He is so accurate with his aim – it is unreal. He'll chip balls in his bedroom; he just loves it.'

Last month he competed in the Premier Junior Tour in Florida - although it is hard for the Grimes family to find tournaments where he can actually play against kids his own age.

Karen Hannaford, co-owner of the Premier Junior Tour, said she was amazed how he struck the ball with 'no thought'.

She added: 'Some kids seemed to be over-coached, where he seems to be hand-eye coordinated and just goes up and hits the ball.

'His swing seems to be more instinctive – rather than taught. Also noticeable is how well he keeps his focus given a nine hole round of golf.

'I did enjoy how relaxed his family is. They were not pressuring him. He seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself.'

Mrs Grimes said as long as James continued to have fun, she would keep bringing him to play golf, but won't pressure him.
