A lottery winner who scooped £5.5million with a winning ticket illegally claimed thousands of pounds in benefits while living the high life in Spain, a court was told yesterday.

Lawrence Candlish was catapulted into a list of the top 100 richest young people in the UK when he won the cash in 1997 at the age of 23.

He splashed out on seven homes neighbouring his own for his family, and even shared out £1.2million among a dozen other relatives.

Then and now: Lawrence Candlish, 38, scooped the multi-million-pound jackpot in 1997, left, but after moving to Spain in 2005 he claimed more than £13,000 in benefits. He appeared at court on crutches, above right

Candlish later emigrated to Spain, where he bought a Newcastle United-themed villa and a restaurant.

But while he frittered away his 
fortune 800 miles away on the Costa Blanca he was also claiming 
thousands in disability living allowance.

Accused: It was heard that Candlish's sister Melanie Batey, to whom he gave £800,000 of his winnings in 1997, claimed £23,131.09 in benefits she was not entitled to after she moved to Spain to live hear her brother

Candlish, who was not entitled to 
claim any UK benefits while living abroad, yesterday escaped prison 
after the court was told he returned to Britain last year penniless.

Instead the 38-year-old was handed a 
nine-month suspended sentence after he admitted pocketing £13,365.

His 
sister, Melanie Batey, a 39-year-old office clerk who moved to Spain to 
be with him, also avoided jail after she claimed more than £20,000 in 
benefits she was not entitled to.

Factory worker Candlish, who suffers 
from bone disease, was struggling on a £125-a-week wage when he scooped 
the National Lottery jackpot, the court was told.

He immediately split his fortune with 
his parents and sister and splashed out £370,000 on seven homes on the estate where he lived in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, so his family could all 
live near one another.

But after thugs torched his house he 
moved to Santa Pola, in Alicante.

Once there, the Newcastle United fan 
bought a villa and re-named it Casa Shearer in honour of former England
 striker Alan Shearer.

He also purchased an Irish-themed bar and 
restaurant.

But between May 2005 and December 2010 he continued claiming benefit payments from the Department for Work and Pensions.

After the windfall: Candlish shared his newfound riches with his family in 2007. (left to right) Aunts Rachel and Gloria, sister Melanie, uncle Ken, mother Jenny and aunts Maureen and Linda.

Batey, who is a paraplegic, and her 
husband joined her brother in Spain in 2007 and continued to claim 
income support she was not entitled to, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Vince Ward, mitigating for both, said 
that since his lottery win Candlish had fallen on hard times. His 
restaurant business had gone bankrupt and his father, Frank, 57, had 
been found hanged in 2009.

In 2010, Candlish flew home from Spain without a penny to his name.

Candlish and Batey, both of Gateshead, pleaded guilty to converting criminal property in relation to their benefit claims.

Sentencing the pair, Recorder Tim Roberts QC told them: ‘You knew what you were doing was fraudulent.’
