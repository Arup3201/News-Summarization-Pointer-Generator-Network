A policeman who lost his leg in a motorbike crash while on duty is to take part in a charity bike ride after being fitted with a new prosthetic knee joint.

Malcolm Hingle's bespoke joint will allow him to ride a bike like an able-bodied person and to make the 375 mile journey without discomfort.

The device is made from flexible carbon fibre and has been specially cut to fit a prosthetic knee that enables Mr Hingle to peddle normally.

Malcolm Hingle, 52, had to have his left leg amputated following a motorbike crash

The £5,000 socket has been designed so that it will not rub against his stump and cause blisters, meaning the 52-year-old can ride for long periods.

The former detective constable will use the socket and prosthetic knee while taking part in a Paris to London bike ride to raise money for the charity Help for Heroes.

Mr Hingle, from Chingford, northeast London, lost his left leg above the knee after a motorbike crash in 2006.

He was riding a police bike while following drug dealer when a car pulled out in front of him causing him to crash.

He underwent 56 operations, but his leg was amputated in July 2011 following an irrecoverable infection.

Now experts at the private clinic, Dorset Orthopaedic in Ringwood, Hampshire, have made him the new joint free of charge.

He had 56 operations but his knee became infected so doctors has no choice but to remove the leg above the knee

He has now been fitted with a new prosthetic knee joint to allow him to ride a bicycle

Mr Hingle said: ‘I was a Met police detective on surveillance duty following a major criminal in London.

‘A car did a right turn and we collided, I was thrown to the floor and dislocated my left knee and had a compartmental fracture in my right forearm.

‘I had 56 operations, about six of those were on my arm, but in 2011 the knee became infected which resulted in the left leg being amputated.

‘I have got a pneumatic knee joint through the NHS but when I heard about the Help for Heroes bike ride I knew I'd need a different socket.

Next month he will take part in a charity bike ride from Paris to London to raise money for Help for Heroes

‘As the journey is so long a normal socket would leave me with huge sores if I were to use it every day for that type of activity.

‘Dorset Orthopaedic offered to make me a socket to my measurements, which is perfect for the bike ride as I'll be cycling around 80 miles a day.

‘It fits with the pneumatic knee joint which is also perfect for the bike ride as it's pumping up and down and is made for that kind of movement.’

David Hills, clinical director at Dorset Orthopaedic said: ‘This is a specially designed socket using Comfort Fit technology.

Mr Hingle is hoping to raise £5,000 for the charity by taking part in the bike ride

‘This involves using very flexible materials that make cycling easier, combined with extremely lightweight materials such as carbon fibre.

‘I designed this socket around the shape of Malcolm's saddle on his bike so that it is comfortable enough for him to cycle over very long distances.

‘Malcolm is an above the knee amputee so having a very comfortable and flexible socket that doesn't rub or come into contact with the saddle is extremely important.

‘In addition to this, the prosthesis is fitted with a lightweight hydraulic knee that allows an easier pedal action.

‘We created a cast by hand for the test sockets and Malcolm undertook a 54 mile cycle while trialling his prosthesis at home before taking final delivery.’

Mr Hingle, who lives with wife Shirley, hopes to raise £5,000 by taking part in the bike ride next month.
