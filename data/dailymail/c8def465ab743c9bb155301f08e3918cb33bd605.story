Celebrity chef Pete Evans has been given the silver medal for the worst diet of the year, but the My Kitchen Rules host has ridiculed the claims, labelling them laughable.

The British Dietetic Association named the paleo diet second on the list of diets to avoid for 2014, just days before Evans is set to release his new cookbook 'Paleo Everyday'. 

The paleo diet, which Evans championed in Australia, was knocked out of first place only by 'uro-therapy', which involves drinking urine for health benefits.

My Kitchen Rules host and celebrity chef Pete Evans has ridiculed a new list of the top diets to avoid of 2014

Evans spoke out on his Facebook page about the list, asking 'is someone taking the p**s?', in reference to uro-therapy, which has been adopted by Bear Grylls.

'I usually don't post things like this but I couldn't stop laughing and thought you could do with a belly laugh too!' Evans posted to his followers. 

The diet involves eating 'like a cave man', restricting consumption to fuel that would have been available during the stone age.

Evans' book 'The Paleo Chef' was a hit within Australia, supporting the regime known as the Paleolithic Diet, the Caveman diet and the Stone Age Diet, which involves no processed foods, no sugar, no dairy, no grains, and no legumes.

The Dietetic Association slammed the diet as 'an unbalanced, time-consuming, socially isolating diet...a sure-fire way to develop nutrient deficiencies, which can compromise health and your relationship with food.'

The Dieticians Association of Australia labelled the fad diet, which is reportedly followed by celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and Matthew McConaughey, inappropriate for today's lifestyle and life expectancy.

The paleo diet, of which Evans is a champion, came second on the list, losing out only to the 'urine therapy' diet

'I think we’ve got to realise that the average age of cave men was 25 years old,' Julie Gilbert, spokesperson for the DAA told news.com.au. 

'So while the paleo diet might have supported them, that diet is not going to support us where our life expectancy is into our 80s,' she said. 

'Any diet that cuts kilojoules will end up in weight loss. But you don’t have to cut out whole food groups — like grains or dairy — to achieve that.' 

Evans found the Dietetic Association's ruling humourous and suggested that next year he might take top spot on the list. 

'The UK version of the DAA have listed the paleo diet just behind urine therapy as the worst possible diets,' he said.

'I am slightly p**sed off by the urine drinkers for taking out first place...Haha! Maybe next year we can beat them to top place, but not at their own game...ewww!' the chef wrote. 

Evans is no stranger to controversy over the paleo diet, experiencing ridicule from media and health experts when he announced in 2012 that he enjoyed eating 'activated almonds'. 

Several parody Twitter accounts have been created to mock the celebrity chef, in response to his outrageous claims

Several parody Twitter accounts have been created to mock the celebrity chef, in response to his outrageous claims.

One of the accounts is listed under the title of 'I love psuedoscience'. The account's description says 'fad diets rule,' and has the location set to 'kale'.

'It's official, I'm better than p**s!' said one tweet.

Evans has been slammed for his 'feelpinions' this week after launching an anti-fluoride campaign in Western Australia, enraging medical professionals who have described his standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice.

'Celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the Stone Age.'  

'I'm occasionally ridiculed or accused of ignorance because I choose to eat and feed my family what I believe to be a nutrient-dense diet,' Evans said on his Facebook page.

'I can't help but find it so bizarre as to why some people find my food choices so offensive?' 

In October, Evans posted a rant on Facebook claiming that the modern Australian diet was behind the rise in autism. 

His fiery post, which was motivated by a rude comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet.

'Why has our rate of autism jumped from 1 in 10000 children in 1974, to 1 in 50 in 2014, where do you think it will be in another 40 years if it is escalating at this rate? This has grown rapidly since the guidelines have been in place!' Evans wrote.

In October, Evans posted a rant on Facebook claiming that the modern Australian diet was behind the rise in autism.

But his 2,100 word post wasn't just limited to autism. He also listed a number of other issues he believes the two nutrition organisations needed to address.

'Isn't it interesting that the people trusted to be delivering health advice for the public have come out not once, not twice, but so many times over the last year or so that I can't keep up with it, with a media campaign to bring down the paleo way of life by saying it is dangerous,' he wrote.

'Why is Australia fast becoming the most obese and unhealthy nations on earth? Is this because we are a nation of self-obsessed, weak-minded people with no self-control? No. Is it because we are a nation that for far too long has been told to steer clear of foods naturally high in fat, which naturally trigger our fullness hormone, and instead told to eat 6 - 8 servings of processed carbohydrate a day, and wonder why we are still hungry after eating 3 cups of rice or 6 slices of bread?'

He said the DAA and Heart Foundation had 'ignited a spark that has been inside me, which is now a raging fire in my belly'.
