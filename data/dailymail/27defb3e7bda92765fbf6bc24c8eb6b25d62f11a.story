The Spaniard fought back from 3-1 behind to stun the No 20 seed in a final set to move through to the last 16

It was the second major upset that the man from Tenerife has caused after he beat Wes Newton in the first round before Christmas.

Reyes, who averaged 88.42 and hit nine 180s, said: ‘I’m speechless. I can’t believe this – it is amazing.’

‘All my friends and everybody in Spain is watching over the internet because it is not on TV there and we got a lot of messages before this game.’

A frustrated Painter said: ‘It was comical and slightly embarrassing to lose over seven sets to someone with an 88 average.

‘If he can win the in the second round of the World Championships with an 88 average then I’ve got to look at myself.

‘I’m not quite sure how I lost it, but if you don’t take your chances and put people away you pay the price. I don’t think he did enough to win the game, but maybe I didn’t either.’

In the first match of Saturday’s afternoon session, Andy Hamilton survived a blip in the second and third sets to come from behind and beat Kyle Anderson.

The No 12 seed took the first set before falling 2-1 behind, but fought back strongly to clinch a 4-2 victory and a place in the last 16, where he will face Peter Wright.

Hamilton insisted his average of 90.06 against Anderson will need to improve against Wright, saying: ‘It’s not good enough to win anything.’

‘I need to step up at least five or six just to compete with Peter Wright. I’m struggling, but still fighting to win games. It’s all about confidence and winning games brings more confidence.’

In the final match of the afternoon session, Kim Huybrechts battled back from the brink to beat Ian White 4-3.

The Belgian averaged 93.74 on his way to a final-set win against the No 15 seed, finally sealing his success on double eight having missed his previous four shots at a double.
