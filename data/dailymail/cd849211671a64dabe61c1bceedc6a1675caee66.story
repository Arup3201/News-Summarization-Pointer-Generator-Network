More than 400 migrants were stopped from getting into Britain from Calais this weekend as they used end-of-summer traffic jams to climb on board vehicles queueing for ferries to Dover.

Police found 300 stowaways in 69 trucks on Saturday alone, forcing them to divert freight traffic along a ‘secure route’ accompanied by riot squads.

The number of migrants found hidden in vehicles in Calais in 2014 is expected to reach 30,000. Some 3,000 are now found every month.

Stoaways: Some 3,000 migrants are found smuggling themselves into UK-bound vehicles in Calais every month

The situation has led to haulage firms advising their drivers to bypass Calais, meaning migrants are now targeting other ports with weaker security.

Don Amour, of the Freight Transport Association, said: ‘While Calais to Dover remains the preferred route for migrants trying to cross to Britain, our members have reported stowaways trying to get into their vehicles at ports such as Dunkirk, Ostend, Boulogne and St Malo.’

Hafid Derideche, of French haulage firm Atlantic Europe, said: ‘We see more and more migrants in western France, in ports in Brittany and Le Havre.’

The French government will today be urged to approve plans for a ‘Sangatte-style’ camp outside Calais and a series of ‘welcome centres’ for UK-bound migrants across France.

Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart will tell interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve that providing shelter, food and information on asylum to migrants determined to reach the UK is the only way to take back control of her town. 

But the proposed camp has been likened to the notorious Red Cross Centre at Sangatte that was used by 60,000 as a springboard for illegal entry to Britain before it was closed in 2002.

Mrs Bouchart blames Britain’s generous welfare and asylum systems for attracting a stream of migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East which have brought havoc to the streets of Calais.

The influx dramatically increased earlier this year when the crisis in Libya allowed migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan to reach Europe from the North African coast.

French authorities are struggling to maintain order with up to 2,000 living in makeshift camps and squats in and around the town.

The number could reach up to 5,000 by the end of the year, politicians fear.

Armed gangs fight pitched battles for control of the best vantage point from which to break into trucks boarding ferries to Dover.

Riot police are expected to launch a fresh assault on the biggest encampment, known as Jungle 2, in the coming days. But local leaders say a crackdown will not end the problem.

Under the mayor’s proposals a summer camp for children close to the ferry port will be transformed into a hostel for 400, providing regular meals and washing facilities.

Mrs Bouchart has urged the leaders of other towns and villages where migrants have congregated to set up ‘welcome centres’ which will not provide accommodation but will offer advice on their rights. 

And she will also ask for a change in the law to allow migrants to make applications for asylum in Britain while still in France.
