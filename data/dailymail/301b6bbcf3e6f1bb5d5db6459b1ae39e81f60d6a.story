European countries were told that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was aboard the plane of Bolivian president Evo Morales which was diverted to Austria, Spain claims.

According to Spain's foreign minister the information was 'clear' that Snowden was inside the plane, which was grounded and searched last week.

Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo did not reveal who supplied the information, but said the decision to force the Bolivian presidential plane to make a u-turn over Europe was based on the information.

Warning: Bolivian President Evo Morales, seen here arriving back in his country on Wednesday, has threatened to close down the US embassy in La Paz

Search: Evo Morales flight over Europe was grounded on Tuesday sparking an international furore. His plane's route is pictured

Flight ban: Mr Morales had come under suspicion of harbouring US fugitive Edward Snowden (pictured inset) on board his flight from Moscow

'They told us that the information was clear, that he was inside,' Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Friday on Spanish National Television.

Meanwhile, Bolivian President Evo Morales is threatening to close the US embassy in La Paz after the incident.

His warning comes after his
plane was forced to make a u-turn over Europe on Tuesday after he was 
apparently barred from flying through French, Portuguese, Italian and 
Spanish airspace following suspicions that US fugitive Edward Snowden 
was on board.

Mr Morales 
has since blamed the US government for pressurising the European 
countries into the ban, which has caused a diplomatic furore.

No asylum: Russia appears to be losing patience with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden

According to the BBC, Mr Morales said: 'My hand would not shake to close the US embassy.

'We have dignity, sovereignty. Without the United States, we are better politically and democratically.'

Reports
claimed Morales's flight was brought down because there were 
suggestions that American National Security Agency (NSA) leaker, Edward 
Snowden, was on board, after the Bolivian presidentÂ  said casually in 
Moscow that if Snowden was to apply for asylum, his case would be 
considered.

Russia meanwhile appeared to be losing patience with former US spy agency contractor Snowden's stay in the country.

Deputy
foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said that the country had received no 
official request for political asylum and that Snowden has to solve his 
own problems.

He has spent 11 days in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since arriving from Hong Kong.

Although Russian president Vladimir 
Putin has refused to extradite Snowden and Russian officials have 
apparently delighted in him evading capture by the US, it seems he is 
becoming increasingly unwelcome there.

Mr Ryabkov told Reuters: 'He needs to choose a place to go.

'As of this moment, we do not have a formal application from Mr Snowden asking for asylum in the Russian Federation.'

Putin has also urged him to leave as soon as he can.

He will only grant Snowden, 30, asylum if he agrees to stop actions that could harm the US - a condition that saw Snowden withdraw his application.

France and Italy have also turned down requests from Snowden for asylum say Reuters.

Although US and Russian relationsions have been somewhat strained since Putin returned to power, the two nations are said to be talking every day about the Snowden issue.
