A rebel Tory MP’s bid to force David Cameron to bring  forward his proposed referendum on Britain’s links with Brussels to next year has won strong public support.

More than one in two voters want a referendum in 2014 according to a new poll – and more than six out of ten want MPs to vote on the proposal in three weeks’ time.

The Survation poll comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed last week that Windsor Tory MP Adam Afriyie wants a Commons vote on November 8 on whether to hold a referendum on the EU in October 2014.

Self-made multi-millionaire Mr Afriyie invoked the wrath of the Prime Minister and was accused of sabotaging Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum in 2017 – after the next Election.

Clash: Tory grandees have urged Adam Afriyie to back down from his petition for an early vote on Europe

He faced fresh attack yesterday when Tory grandees begged him to back down and came close to accusing him of betraying his country.

In an open letter they told Mr Afriyie not to meddle with the Cameron-backed 2017 EU Referendum Bill, stating: ‘No one individual is bigger than the future of our nation – we call on you to withdraw.’

But defiant Mr Afriyie promised to continue his battle and fellow maverick Conservative MP Julian Lewis publicly backed his 2014 referendum rally cry.

According to the Survation poll for this newspaper, a total of  55 per cent favour an EU referendum before the next Election, due in 2015, with fewer than one in three saying it should take place afterwards.

Do you trust Cameron? The poll's findings. More than six in ten want MPs to vote in three weeks' time

A total of 54 per cent agree with Mr Afriyie that Mr Cameron will not fulfil his 2017 pledge – against one in three who say he will.

There is even bigger support for Mr Afriyie’s bid to force a Commons vote when the No 10- backed Referendum Bill – sponsored by Tory loyalist James Wharton – is debated next month on November 8.

A massive 61 per cent say the Parliamentary vote should go ahead with just 24 per cent against. The poll shows a continuing public desire to leave the EU, but that could change if it hands back key powers.

Asked how they would vote if a 2014 referendum went ahead, nearly one in two, 46 per cent, would vote to leave – with 38 per cent in favour of staying in.

But if the EU made ‘significant concessions’ then 47 per cent would vote to stay in – with 30 per cent wanting withdrawal.

Mr Afriyie said last night: ‘This poll confirms what I hear in my constituency and on doorsteps around the country and what the Conservative party knows: the people want a referendum on Europe before the Election. I am trying to give them that chance.’

The letter to Mr Afriyie from prominent Tory MPs – including Sir Gerald Howarth, Sir Edward Leigh, Andrea Leadsom and Nadhim Zahawi – says: ‘We support the PM’s decision to hold a referendum after the next Election. Any attempt to tamper with it runs the risk of wrecking it completely.’
