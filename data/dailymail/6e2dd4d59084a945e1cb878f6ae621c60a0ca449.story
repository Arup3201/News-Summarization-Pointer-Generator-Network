Corruption in the UK has grown since the coalition came to power and has caused a 'crisis of trust' in Britain's political system, according to a new survey.

Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, released today, revealed that 65 per cent of people believe that corruption has increased in the past two years.

The figures are part of a survey of 114,000 people in 107 countries about bribery around the world.

Since 2010, public trust in institutions such as the media, judiciary and police have dropped.

Almost 70 per cent of people now believe the sector has a corruption problem - up from less than 40 per cent two years ago.

The number of Britons admitting to paying a bribe has also jumped.

One in 20 people in Britain say they have paid a bribe for services - up from just one in 100 in 2010.

The report said the UK Government 'has not been paying sufficient attention to this disturbing trend'.

One in five Britons said they had resorted to bribing people in the judicial system, while almost one in ten said they had paid a bribe while in contact with the police.

Seven per cent said they had bribed education officials, while 11 per cent of people who had contact with the registry and permit services or land services said they bribed workers.

The report found that while corruption 'is not endemic' there are 'significant problems' that should be addressed.

The report's authors said the results show a 'crisis of trust' in Britain's political system.

UK corruption is worsening, according to the public poll, and one in 20 people admit to paying a bribe

Two thirds of people believe political parties are corrupt and 55 per cent believe that the British parliament has a corruption problem.

Nine out of ten people say the UK Government is run by a few big entities acting in their own interest.

Robert Barrington, executive director of Transparency International UK, said the country has been 'complacent about corruption' despite warning signals over the past five years.

He said: 'The result is now beginning to show, and some recent actions, like the abolition of the Audit Commission, are likely to make the situation worse.

'We need the Government to accept there is a problem in the UK rather than claiming it is only a problem overseas.

'This means having someone specifically in charge of tackling corruption; undertaking a national corruption risk assessment; drawing up a national action plan; and making sure that all areas of the public sector have in place the kind of anti-corruption procedures that the government expects of the private sector.'

The worldwide survey shows that corruption continues to be a greater problem elsewhere in the world.

One in four global respondents said they have paid a bribe when accessing public services and institutions in the last 12 months.

Police are viewed as the most corrupt sector in 36 countries, and of those questioned, 53 per cent said that had been asked to pay a bribe to the police. 

Judiciary - 21 per cent

Registry and permit services - 11 per cent

Land services - 11 per cent 

Police - 8 per cent

Education - 7 per cent 

Tax revenue or customs - 4 per cent

Medical and health - 3 per cent

Utilities - 3 per cent

Around the world, people’s appraisal of their leaders’ efforts to stop corruption is worse than before the financial crisis began in 2008, when 31 per cent said their government’s efforts to fight corruption were effective. This year it fell to 22 per cent.

The worldwide survey found that corruption has also worsened in most Arab countries since their 2011 revolutions, according to the public opinion poll.

The Arab public's continued frustration with corruption may undermine governments' efforts to restore political stability, while hindering economic growth and foreign investment.

Of four countries which experienced changes of government during the Arab Spring, a majority of respondents in three - Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen - feel the level of corruption has risen in the past two years, the survey showed.

In Egypt, 64 per cent said corruption had worsened; in Tunisia, the proportion was 80 per cent.

The exception was Libya, where only 46 per cent said the country had become more corrupt.

Within Egypt, 78 per cent of respondents said the police were corrupt or extremely corrupt.

The proportion was 65 per cent for the judiciary and 45 per cent for the military, one of the country's most respected institutions which ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi last week sparking a wave of protests.

Christoph Wilcke, Middle East and North Africa director for Transparency International, said the police, judiciary and political parties in Arab countries needed to be reformed in order to gain the trust of the public.

In the social and economic turmoil that has followed the Arab Spring, however, governments have had little time or energy to push such reforms.

'There is a contradiction between policy and rhetoric,' said Wilcke.
