These are the amazing images of a small otter trying to sleep while resting on the edge of the pacific ocean. 

The small mammal was simply 'too cute not to photograph' according to Sharon Landis, 68, from Washington state. 

Mrs Landis, who retired 13 years ago, took a few days off to photograph some wildlife near the coast of Washington in the Pacific north west.

Sometimes life as a sea otter is too stressful and it is necessary to take time out from constant fishing and worrying about where the next meal is coming from 

'Dear Lord, please watch over me and keep me safe while I sleep on the edge of the deep wide ocean': Sea otters routinely sleep on their backs in the sea

Mrs Landis said: 'Otters spend their entire lives in the water.

'They spend most of their day resting, searching for food, or grooming their fur to keep it waterproof.

'I suspect we caught this one mostly resting.

'My favourite photo is where she's looking at the camera because it just looks like she's looking at me like "what's up".

'The sea otters are pretty social, so we generally see several together, this one just caught my eye.

'I encounter lots of wildlife up close and personal, this little one was especially adorable. They are just so cute.

'Otters are about 4-5ft long and can weigh from 50-100 pounds, with the males being larger.

'These were on the smaller side and female.'

When Mrs Landis is not taking pictures of the wildlife that surrounds her house, she travels in her motorhome or jeep.

She often sees otters whilst travelling north western America and recently returned from a trip to Alaska - where she saw even more of them.

She said: 'We have also encountered these cute little guys along the coast in California and on our trip to Alaska this year.

'We have travelled all over the western US and I have thousands of photos of all kinds of wildlife.' 

Wh-otter looking at: Sea otters are the only otters to give birth in the water, nurse their young on their chests before teaching them how to swim and hunt 

The sea otter is an aquatic member of the weasel family and is most common in the Pacific Ocean in the north American region as well as some parts of Asia 

Animal experts have observed sea otters tangling themselves in forests of seaweed or kelp in order to prevent themselves getting washed away in a storm

Sea otters can grow up to four foot in length and weigh up to 65lbs in weight and have an average lifespan in the wild of around 23 years 

Sea otters have specially adapted webbed feet and have water repellent fur which made them hugely valuable to hunters and trappers in the early 20th century

Sea otters can often be observed using their paws to crack the shells of crabs or mussels against rocks in order to get into the soft and tasty flesh inside 

Sea otters always clean themselves after feeding in order to keep their coats clean as the fur traps a layer of air which keeps the animal warm in cold water
