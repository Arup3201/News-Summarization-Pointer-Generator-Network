An elderly postmistress foiled two masked robbers who pointed a gun at her during a hold-up – by giving them a 'five second warning'.

Carol Jones, 72, who has been running her village post office for more than 30 years, refused to give in when the raiders held a pistol to her face.

She told them: 'If you've not left here in five seconds I'll get the police using the alarm system.'

James Price, 16, and David Andrews, 21, fled and were later jailed for a total of eight years for attempted robbery and possession of an imitation firearm.

Prosecutor John Probert said the pair the pistol into Mrs Jones' face to demand cash.

But the pair were silenced by brave Mrs Jones's five-second warning - and fled the post office at Graig-yr-Rhacca, near Caerphilly, South Wales.

Cool Mrs Jones even served another customer at the shop in Graig-yr-Rhacca, near Caerphilly, South Wales, before calling the police. 

Police arrested Price at his home and found a blue imitation gun along with a balaclava and a paint balling mask used in the February raid.

Recorder Judge Eleri Rees praised Mrs Jones for her bravery at Cardiff Crown Court after the pair admitted their crimes.

She said: 'To her credit she showed great resilience she stood her ground and then called the police. You were armed with an imitation firearm- she had no idea if it was a real firearm or not.

Speaking after the sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, Mrs Jones's son Simon, 48, said: 'She was resilient on that day but then went downhill. She has picked up now and is back working.'

'We have a 72-year-old lady who had worked at that post office for many years.

Price, of Machen, near Caerphilly, was sentenced to a total of three and a half years imprisonment.

Homeless Andrews was sentenced to a total of four years and eight months imprisonment.

The judge lifted reporting restrictions that had previously banned the identification of Price because of his age. 

Mrs Jones's son Simon, 48, said: 'She was resilient on that day but then went downhill. She has picked up now and is back working.'
