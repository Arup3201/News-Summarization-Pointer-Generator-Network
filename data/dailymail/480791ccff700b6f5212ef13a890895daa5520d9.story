London's first electric zero-emission black cabs are now on trial in the city.

Designed and built in Britain, the all-new zero-emission Range-Extended Electric Metrocab run on a powerful, near-silent electric motor. 

Inside there is seating for up to seven passengers, complete with a USB charging socket, panoramic glass roof and colour TV displays.

A multifunction touchscreen display, digital 'infotainment system', hands free phone, air con and air suspension are also fitted as standard.

Having been in development for over 10 years, the new Metrocab has covered over 600,000 engineering test miles. 

London cabbies were invited to trial the new cab last year by registering online.

In April 2014 London Mayor Boris Johnson had a test drive in one of the new Metrocabs.  

• 75mpg and over three times more fuel efficient than comparable current London taxi

• 75% less CO2 than comparable current London taxi, <50g/km CO2

• 560km combined range

• Significantly lower running costs, typically saving a London cabbie £20 – 40 per day

• Zero-emissions mode and home charging via standard mains outlet

• Evolutionary design, sympathetic to iconic London taxi silhouette

• 10 years in development and over a million engineering test kilometres

• Six passenger seats (plus optional seventh passenger seat in the front)

• Fully compliant with London Public Carriage Office (PCO) regulations

He said at the time: 'It's superb, an absolutely beautiful machine and a masterpiece of British engineering.

'I have just driven it and it's totally silent. It's the Rolls Royce of taxis and it will do 100mpg'.

So far a price tag has not yet been set, but Metrocab has announced there will be no price premium over the current black cab, which costs around £33,000.

The new Metrocab is driven by two independent brushless electric motors. 

A small petrol engine, coupled with a generator - the 'Range Extender' - is used to recharge the battery pack or provide power directly to the motors.

Plug-in charging is also achieved via any mains outlet when the taxi is off duty.

As pollution levels rise over major cities, governments are looking to more energy efficient, low emission, modes of transport.

A company spokesman said: 'The new Metrocab boasts an incredible environmental record, exceeding current standards.

'Metrocab can operate with zero emissions, giving it a range of well over 50 miles on its battery pack only.

Developed over 10 years, the new Metrocab has covered more than 600,000 engineering test miles

'In Range Extender low-emission mode, the new Metrocab produces less than 50g/KM of CO2 – significantly better than any other vehicle in the market.'

Performance figures entitle Metrocab owners to a wide range of tax breaks and government grants.

Last year Nissan launched a new version of the London black cab, featuring an engine it claims will be far more environmentally friendly than any of its rivals.

The taxi, which comes with a 1.6 litre petrol engine instead of the 2.5 litre diesel one fitted in the majority of the capital's cabs, is designed to mix innovation and tradition - embracing the large round headlights and over-sized grilles that have been synonymous with London taxis for decades.

Last year Mr Johnson, who drives a petrol Toyota people carrier, announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital.

In July he revealed plans for almost all diesel vehicle drivers to be charged an extra £10 to drive into Central London as part of a new ultra-low emissions zone from 2020.

Other cities across the country are also considering a charge as they urgently look at ways to cut diesel fumes to comply with EU clean air rules.

Around 29,000 deaths a year are linked to air pollution in Britain.

Britain is facing £300 million in European Commission fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution

Strict targets should have been met by January 2010 and in February 2014 the EU launched legal proceedings to force the Government to deal with air pollution.

MailOnline was unable to reach Metrocab for an update on the trial.

The Nissan taxi is environmentally cleaner than existing cabs, offering 32 miles to the gallon and CO2 emissions of 132g/km - but an electric 'zero emission' version to rival Metrocab is rumoured to follow in 2015
