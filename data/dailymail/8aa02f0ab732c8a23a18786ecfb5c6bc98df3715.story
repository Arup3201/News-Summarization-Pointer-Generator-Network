They range from pieces of meat to everyday grooming products and must-have electronic devices.

The goods most likely to be shoplifted have been revealed as choice cuts of meat, expensive bottles of alcohol and hi-tech items such as electric toothbrushes and smartphones.

Razor blades - in particular, the high-priced Gillette Mach 4 - and deodorants are also high on the list of most at-risk products, researchers claim.

Unsurprisingly, designer clothing and expensive fragrances are regularly targeted by thieves too, according to AdWeek.com.

Perhaps more left-field is America's eighth most-shoplifted item of 2011 - the musical Muppets toy Let's Rock Elmo.

One in every 11 people to walk into a shop will leave the store with at least one item that wasn't paid for, figures released by the U.S. National Association of Shoplifting Prevention reveal.

This represents 1.45 per cent of total sales, meaning U.S. retailers are likely to lose a staggering $119billion (£76billion) to shoplifters this year.

Shoplifting has increased by six per cent in the U.S. compared with last year, a rise blamed on the economic downturn.

Only three per cent of thefts from stores are committed by professionals, with the vast majority carried out by opportunists.

Barbara Staib, spokesperson for the National Association of Shoplifting Prevention, said: 'Seventy per cent of shoplifters tell us they didn't plan to shoplift.'

However, more than a third - 35 per cent - of thefts are undertaken with the help of a corrupt employee.

The public image of shoplifting as a crime committed by bored teenagers is also incorrect as most thefts are committed by adults in employment.

Johnny Custer, from research firm Merchant Analytic Solutions, said: 'Most shoplifters simply succumb to temptation.

'But add a sense of desperation because of the economy and holiday pressures, and you have the recipe for theft soup.

'People won't be able to provide the same kind of Christmas they’re accustomed to,' he added. 'They can't afford the hot toy.'
