Jeffrey Darling, 48, was reported missing last Tuesday after calling authorities for help

A 48-year-old man reported missing in New Mexico has been found after crawling onto a highway with two broken legs.

Jeffrey Darling was rushed to San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington last Thursday afternoon, and a spokesperson told the Daily Times that he was in a 'serious condition' going into the weekend.

He had used his cell phone to call authorities at 1am on Tuesday to report that he was in trouble but they were unable to pinpoint his exact location and his battery later died.

Three days later he emerged on the corner of U.S. Highway 64 and Andrea Drive, where he managed to flag down a motorist.

San Juan County Sheriff's detective Lt. Cory Tanner says deputies believe Darling had vision problems and accidentally fell into a ravine.

The only information they had on his whereabouts before his phone cut out was that he was near some 'cottonwood trees, a bridge and a building.'

It was believed that he was in the Animas River corridor.

However, a thorough search around the tree-lined stretch of water proved fruitless.

An appeal was launched with a poster on Facebook describing Darling as a brown-haired 5ft 6in male, weighing around 160lbs.

His outfit apparently consisted of a gray beanie hat, brown jacket and tan-colored pants.

He was eventually found Thursday at 5:30pm about 300 yards from where he fell with evidence that he had managed to build a fire.

Lt. Tanner said that it was incredible he managed to survive the three-day ordeal with no access to food or water.

'He survived the coldest nights of winter we've had so far,' Tanner said. 

Last week temperatures in Farmington, New Mexico, dropped well below minus five Celsius.

Darling remained hospitalized Monday and was unable to speak with a reporter. 

It is believed his injuries are the result of an accidental fall.
