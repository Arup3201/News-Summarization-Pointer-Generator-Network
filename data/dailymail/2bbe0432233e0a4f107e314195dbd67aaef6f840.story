Ivy League schools have started recruiting more economically diverse students from China after receiving multi-million dollar grants from public and private donors.

Chinese billionaire real estate couple, Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin, gifted $100 million to top U.S. universities last year- including $10 million to Yale and $15 million to Harvard - in a bid to help poor students from their home country.

The State Department's EducationUSA program also created million-dollar funds to provide aid for overseas students to cover costs such as application fees and transportation to interviews.

Financial aid: In this November 20, 2014 photo, Yupei Guo, top, greets friend Serene Silin Li at Yale University - she's one of the Chinese students who has benefited from college's refocused recruitment strategy 

Commenting on the move, Evan Ryan, an assistant secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, said: 'The State Department thought, "Wait, we're really losing a whole population of the students that are important to the U.S. higher education system and important to our relationships around the world."'

EducationUSA has eight advisers in Beijing and is sending four more to Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang this year to reach students beyond the capital.

The agency has been important to recruiting, Yale officials say, because it makes referrals knowing the school has the resources to cover students' need.

Yupei Guo is one student who has benefited from the 'refocused' recruitment strategy.

She does not fit the mold of the traditional Ivy League student from China: Her journalist parents are neither rich nor members of the governing elite.

Growing up, she thought the cost would make it impossible for her to attend one of the famed American universities. At Yale tuition, room and board cost nearly $60,000 a year.

All walks of life: With more undergraduates coming from overseas than ever, some Ivy League universities are reaching out in new ways to attract international students of more varied backgrounds

Fitting in: Despite some uncomfortable questions about her background, Guo said she does not feel out of place at Yale, where the Chinese students are increasingly diverse with several freshmen from inland cities

But by the time she applied to the college, it was among the U.S. schools investing in more economic diversity among their growing ranks of international students.

Guo, 19, is now a Yale sophomore, happily settled among the school's Gothic buildings. 

Most would never guess university grants cover much of the Beijing native's tuition, at least not judging by the questions she gets around New Haven.

'I did get asked if I were some sort of distant royal family member, which I'm not,' she said. 

Guo attended a selective public high school in Beijing and learned from upperclassmen the names of U.S. schools with need-blind admissions - Yale, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Dartmouth and Amherst. 

She visited Yale during high school - on a U.S. visit for model United Nations - and felt energized by the posters advertising campus activities.

At home, her departure was met with a mix of admiration and scorn. Yale is a celebrated name in China, where her acceptance prompted calls from reporters. 

On trend: Nearly 275,000 students came from China last year, 31per cent of all international students, according to the Institute of International Education. 

But Guo said there is also a stigma that comes with attending college in the U.S., as though those leaving failed to fit into the Chinese system. 

And there is bitterness: Financial concerns prevent many of her friends from going to college at all.

However, it's hoped that education abroad will become more accessible in the near future.

The admissions directors at Yale and Harvard say the investment they have received will help create the diversity sought by students and faculty.

'We want to make sure that we get the most talented students from every corner of the world, and it's just that simple,' Harvard Dean of Admissions William Fitzsimmons said.    

Despite some uncomfortable questions about her background, Guo said she does not feel out of place at Yale, where the Chinese students are increasingly diverse with several freshmen coming from inland cities.

'This place,' she said, 'is amazing.'
