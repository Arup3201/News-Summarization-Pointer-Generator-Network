Talk about a winter wonderland.

Massive icicles, designed in varying shapes and sizes and illuminated in multiple colors, form a literal ice castle in Vermont.

The ice castle can be visited at Stratton Mountain Resort's Sun Bowl Lodge, and is open to the public.

Three other castles exist: they are in Midway, Utah; Eden Prairie, Minnesota; and Lincoln, New Hampshire. All four are created through a Utah company called Ice Castles, LLC.

Cory Livingwood, who heads up the Stratton location, told KCAX 'Most places the way they build is with blocks of ice. Ours in very unique. It started in a guy's backyard when he was just playing with sprinklers and icicles.

Man-made: The ice castlewas built by team members who spent 17 days in 12-hour shifts

'He actually has a patent on the process. So not only are we the only people who do this, we're the only people allowed to do it too.'

'A lot of people will say, oh the kids must love it,' Livingwood told the television station. 'But even as adults, when you're standing next to a tower that's 20,30,40 feet tall, it makes you feel small.'

'Basically when you enter we ask you no running, no climbing no breaking the ice and it's all for your own safety,' he told KCAX.  

Speaking to News10, Livingwood explained 'We grow the castles rather than sculpt them. From marble, if you take like a block and carve it down into something; we’re actually doing the exact opposite.

'We’re starting with something small, and we’re adding to it to make it larger.'

The ice castle was built by team members who spent 17 days in 12-hour shifts, the television station reported. The icicles are lit up with LED lights tucked inside ice formations, according to News10.

Ice Castles says on its website that the Stratton structure will likely remain open until March 7, though that could change due to the weather.
