Gun control: Karl Pierson's Facebook posts suggested he favored tighter laws on firearms

Colorado gunman Karl Pierson, who seriously injured a 17-year-old girl when he opened fire at his school, supported tougher gun laws.

The 18-year-old, who had been dropped from the debate team, was said to have had strong views on politics and gun control, classmates said.

Pierson was also allegedly suspended from the school in September for making threats against the team coach, Tracy Murphy, believed to have been the target for Friday's attack.

'He had very strong beliefs about gun laws and stuff,' junior Abbey Skoda told the Denver Post.

The paper reported that Pierson had once posted an image on Facebook with the slogan: 'The Republican Party: Health Care: Let 
'em Die, Climate Change: Let 'em Die, Gun Violence: Let 'em Die, Women's
 Rights: Let 'em Die, More War: Let 'em Die. Is this really the side you
 want to be on?'

The post had been removed on Saturday.

Despite seemingly supporting gun control, Pierson legally bought the shotgun that he used only one week before carrying out his attack.

The teenager carried out his attack while his mother, who he had been living with since his parents divorced, was out of town caring for a sick relative.

During the attack he fired five times, shooting 17-year-old Claire Davis at point blank range, before shooting himself in the library.

Claire, who is not believed to have known Pierson, is in critical condition in hospital.

County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said at a
 press conference on Saturday afternoon that Claire was 'an innocent victim of 
an evil act of violence'.

A vigil was held for the popular student on Saturday night, as her parents called for prayers and privacy.

Sheriff Robinson said Pierson's 'evil intent' had been to harm multiple people.

Several students at Arapahoe High School claimed that the outspoken teenager had been in an argument with Mr Tracy, believed to be his intended target, earlier in the year, which led to him being dropped from the team.

Joe Redmond, one of the captains of the team, told the Los Angeles Times that Pierson had been suspended from school for two weeks in September for making threats.

'When he came back he was really, really angry,' Joe said, adding that he asked Pierson to return to the team on Monday after they came first in a tournament.

But the 18-year-old said he still hated Mr Tracy and told him: 'Apparently you get suspended for threatening to kill a teacher.'

Joe defended his friend's memory though, telling the paper: 'At the end of the day Karl was a good person ... I loved to be around him. I loved to talk to him. Itâ€™s always a shame when you hear friends making bad choices, but this one was particularly devastating.'

Some reports said Pierson, who was armed with a shotgun, machete and petrol bombs, had been shouting the coach's name as he began firing inside the school.

Mr Murphy was credited for leaving the building in an attempt to move the gunman away from fellow students.
