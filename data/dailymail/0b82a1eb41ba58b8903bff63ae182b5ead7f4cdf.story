Police are on red alert at the prospect of drones flying overhead during Sunday’s Manchester derby.

Serbia’s Euro 2016 qualifier against bitter rivals Albania had to be abandoned earlier this month after a mass brawl following the landing of a drone carrying a provocative political message landed on the pitch.

But while that is the most high-profile case of its kind this season, there has been an instance closer to home. A man was arrested in a supermarket adjacent to the Etihad after flying a drone over the stadium as City thumped Tottenham 4-1 just a fortnight ago.

The sudden use of the flying devices around sporting arenas presents a fresh problem for Greater Manchester Police, who will also have a helicopter on hand this weekend.

GMP are aware of the potentially growing problem and will arrest anyone found to be flying a device and instructed to land it immediately.

In the region of 400 officers are set to be deployed to ensure Manchester United’s trip to City passes without incident.

Sportsmail understands a raft of banning orders handed to United supporters have recently expired and they are able to attend the derby.

Sniffer dogs will be used to detect any flares, with pyrotechnics having made their way into the ground in recent years – most alarmingly during United’s 3-2 win two years ago when Rio Ferdinand was struck by a coin upon celebrating in front of home fans following Robin van Persie’s last-gasp winner.

Superintendent Craig Thompson, who will be in charge of operations on Sunday, said: ‘We are well used to policing high-profile fixtures like this. I would urge fans to come to the game, enjoy the day and arrive well in time for the kick-off because of the building work going on around the ground.

‘They will see plenty of police officers on the ground who are there to ensure their safety. If there is any trouble or disorder, we will deal with it robustly.’
