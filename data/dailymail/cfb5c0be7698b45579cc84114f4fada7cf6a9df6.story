Nelson Mandela died at home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton, 10 weeks after being allowed out of the Pretoria hospital where he had been treated for a persistent lung infection.

South African president Jacob Zuma said the 95-year-old, who was transferred home by ambulance in August to spend his final weeks there, had 'passed on peacefully in the company of his family'.

Mandela's third wife, Graca Machel, 68, is believed to have been by his side, as well as some of his children, grandchildren, stepchildren, a priest, and elders from his native Thembu tribe.

But there was no sign of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
Mandela's second wife who married him in 1958 and stood by him 
throughout his 27 years in jail before the 38-year marriage ended 
bitterly in 1996.

The former president's condition had fluctuated since June, when he was admitted to hospital suffering from an infection and it was widely feared he was close to death. 

His condition improved enough for him to be allowed home, where his bedroom had been adapted into what was said to resemble an intensive care unit.

Last month Mrs Madikizela-Mandela said her former husband had beaten a bout of pneumonia but was still 'quite ill' and was unable to speak because of tubes inserted into his lungs to clear them of liquid.

She said he was using facial expressions to communicate, and said the house had to be kept sterile to ensure the infection did not recur.

This week Mandela's condition again deteriorated, and he was reported to be on life support and unconscious as the end neared.

On Wednesday, the day before her 
father died, Mandela's eldest daughter Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, 60,  said: 'You can see he is struggling, but 
the fighting spirit is there with him.'

And his grandson by his late son Makgatho Mandela, Ndaba Mandela, 30, said: 'He is not doing well at home in bed.'

It is not known if Winnie Mandela, who was married to the statesman from 1958-1996, was there at the end

Ndaba's older brother Mandla Mandela,
39, is believed to have been with Mandela in his final hours, as were 
Graca Mandela's children Josina and Malenga Machel, who are in their 
30s.  A priest was also said to have been summoned to the house yesterday evening.

The former personal assistant Zelda la Grange, 43, is although thought to have been close to the family as Mandela's condition worsened.

During the last hours before his death at 8.50pm Johannesburg time, elders from Mandela's native Thembu clan joined his relatives at his side.

The elders would have performed, either 
at Mandela's home or later in the mortuary, a traditional ceremony 
called 'the closing of the eyes', to herald the transition from life to 
the next stage.

The ceremony would have involved the elders talking to Mandela, and also to his ancestors, to explain what was happening to his spirit during each stage as he passed from life on earth, CNN reported.

This morning, Mandela's body was removed from his house in a coffin draped in a South African flag and taken to a military hospital in Pretoria, before the start of a 10-day mourning period.

Next Sunday a state funeral, expected to be the biggest funeral Africa and possibly the world has ever seen, will take place in the Eastern Cape village of Qunu where Mandela spent his childhood.
