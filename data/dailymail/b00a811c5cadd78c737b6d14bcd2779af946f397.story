A private firm running a failing NHS clinic will walk off with £53million of taxpayers’ cash thanks to a botched Labour contract.

Ministers terminated the contract with Clinicenta to run the treatment centre at Lister Hospital in Stevenage after local GPs stopped referring patients to the unit.

They lost confidence in the Lister Surgicentre and the Care Quality Commission watchdog carried out an investigation into the deaths of three people after operations on joints.

The unit, which also carries out eye operations and gynaecological procedures, also lost 8,500 outpatient medical files.

According to local doctors, this meant six people suffered irreversible loss of sight because they never received follow-up appointments after eye work.

The CQC found the unit was not meeting minimum standards. Yet the terms of the contract signed by Labour mean that the Department of Health must pay £53million to Clinicenta, owned by Carillion, to end the deal.

The NHS will resume providing services.

Health minister Anna Soubry said Labour 'introduced private NHS provision, and paid over the odds for exorbitant contracts whether or not the work took place or the care was good'

Health minister Anna Soubry said: ‘Shadow ministers peddle lies about Coalition privatisation, yet Labour introduced private NHS provision, and paid over the odds for exorbitant contracts whether or not the work took place or the care was good.’

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be appalled that they have been lumbered with the enormous bill for bringing this contract to an end.

‘It is outrageous that a treatment centre which was failing patients should still have been able to sap up taxpayers’ cash, regardless of its performance.

‘All future deals of this kind must 
deliver better taxpayer value for money, with terms that allow for 
contracts to be terminated swiftly and easily if the performance of the 
service provider is not up to scratch.’

The Surgicentre was run by Clinicenta, which is owned by Carillion, a construction firm.Clinicenta does not run any other NHS treatment centres.

Mike Hobbs, the firm’s managing director, said: ‘Our intention is that the services currently provided by Clinicenta at the Lister Surgicentre will transfer by mutual agreement to East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust.

‘The date of transfer is still to be finalised but there will be no break in service provision and the NHS will retain the Lister Surgicentre buildings and equipment for continued use.’

A spokeswoman for East and North Hertfordshire NHS clinical commissioning group said: ‘On termination of the contract, payments totalling approximately £53million will be made to the contractor, Clinicenta.

‘The vast majority of this relates to the value of the building and the equipment which will be retained by the NHS for use in delivering services to patients. We are contractually bound to pay for this even if the contract is not terminated and runs for its full term.’
