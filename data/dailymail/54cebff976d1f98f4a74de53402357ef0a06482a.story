This is all that is left of a £60,000 sports car abandoned by its owner when its engine stopped on a flooded road after it was ‘ripped to shreds’ by thieves.

The 4.2 litre Audi RS5 - which has a top speed of 174mph and does 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds - was ditched on a road near a railway bridge approaching the M25 in Chertsey, Surrey, last month.

In the past two weeks the grey car - which would have cost £59,350 when new - has been stripped to just a shell by vandals.

Stuck in the mud: This £60,000 sports car was abandoned by its owner when its engine stopped on a flooded road and within a fortnight was 'ripped to shreds' by thieves

Stripped: Within just a few days of the car being abandoned, its bonnet, wing mirrors and lights had all gone

Gregg Watkins, who spotted the Audi 
just two days after it was abandoned, said it was ‘incredible’ how fast 
it had been stripped.

He said: 'When I first drove past it, it looked perfect, but within a few days the bonnet, wing mirrors and lights had gone.

'Over
 the course of the next two weeks the car was stripped to the bone and 
is pretty now just a shell with nothing left worth taking.'

Costly: When new the Audio would have cost its owner £59,350

Concern: Photographs of the abandoned car have appeared on various websites

Then and now: The sports car was abandoned by the owner after its engine cut out during the flood

He
 added: 'The owner must have just have seen the state of it, stuck a 
claim in with his insurers and left it to them to deal with it.'

Photographs of the abandoned car have appeared on various websites, including AutoBant and Zero2Turbo, in the past two weeks showing the remains of the one powerful car.

'From a stunning car worth a couple of years’ wages it been ripped to shreds to nothing,' said one unnamed motorist who posted a version of the picture.

'The poor owner will hopefully get a new car on his insurance, but he’ll be wishing he never drove through that puddle.'

Discarded: The car was abandoned close to this railway bridge

Remnants: The car is now virtually unrecognisable

Mystery: A spokesman for Surrey Police said it had no record of the car being stolen

Vanished: All of the car's plush fittings have been taken and its remains have been left to rust on the roadside

The Zero2Turbo website stated: 'Audi RS5 Abandoned On Flooded UK Road Ends Up Being Vandalised.

'This sexy grey Audi RS5 became a victim of vandals after it got stuck in flooded roads in Chertsey, Surrey.

'I see no reason why someone would come along and ruin this car like this. Windows smashed in, doors bashed, rock thrown onto the roof and the interior was completely ripped out.

Pristine: An Audi RS5 similar to the one abandoned in Chertsey

'The car had been standing there for 11 days at the time of posting this and might still be there.

'Sad to see such a nice piece of kit looking helpless in the water.'

A spokesman for Surrey Police said it had no record of the car being stolen and was investigating the criminal damage caused to the vehicle.
