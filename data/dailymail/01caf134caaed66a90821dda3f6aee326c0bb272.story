The former Ukrainian TV presenter charged with attacking Brad Pitt at a movie premiere last month wore a shirt with the actor's picture on it as he serves his community service sentence. 

Prankster Vitalii Sediuk was pictured on Wednesday wearing a Pitt-centric tank top underneath his orange vest while cleaning up Griffith Park in Los Angeles.

Sediuk was sentenced to 20 days of community service after allegedly punching Pitt as he walked the red carpet for the Maleficent movie premiere on May 28.

And this wasn't the only time he was making a spectacle at work.

The Hollywood Reporter released footage of Sediuk goofing off on the job, jamming with a group of musicians in the park.

The videos shows  Sediuk shaking maracas and dancing along with the musicians and then playing the conga drums. The website has also 
published a photo of Sediuk on a carousel.

At the time of the Pitt attack, Sediuk was already on probation for crashing the 2013 Grammys stage as Adele was presented with an award by Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull.

Howev,er Sediuk maintains he was only trying to hug Pitt at the premiere. 

'I never 
hit, I never punched, I never slapped Brad Pitt in the face,' he said. 'This is absolutely false information.'

Pitt has spoken publicly about the incident, calling Sediuk a 'nutter.'

'I
 was at the end of the line signing autographs, when out the corner of 
my eye I saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me,' Pitt told People.
 'I took a step back. This guy had latched onto my lapels. I looked down
 and the nutter was trying to bury his face in my crotch, so I cracked 
him twice in the back of the head - not too hard, but enough to get his 
attention, because he did let go. I think he was then just grabbing for a
 hand hold because the guys were on him, and he reached up and caught my
 glasses.

'I don't mind an exhibitionist, but if this guy keeps it up he's going to spoil it for the fans who have waited up all night for an autograph or a selfie, because it will make people more wary to approach a crowd.

'And he should know, if he tries to look up a woman's dress again, he's going to get stomped.'

Pitt was making a reference to a May 16 incident, when Sediuk sexually harassed actor America Ferrera and crawled under her dress at the Cannes premiere for How to Train Your Dragon 2.

Earlier this year, Sediuk harassed actors Bradley Cooper and Leonardo DiCaprio when he pushed his face into their crotches at red carpet events in January and February, respectively. He was also slapped by Will Smith when he tried to kiss him on the lips at a 2012 movie premiere.
