A Michigan man got the help of a baby kangaroo to propose to his girlfriend - but she didn't notice the ring around its neck after several minutes of holding the little animal. 

When she found the ring on the marsupial's collar, however, she was speechless.  

Jordan Day, 23, proposed to Jessica Harrington, 22, on March 7 in Summit Township, near Jackson.

He hid the ring on the kangaroo's collar, which he made several references to before Harrington noticed. When she did, Day got down on one knee and she was left speechless

The couple have been together for five-and-a-half years, have a three-year-old son named Payton and have been talking about marriage for the last year. 

'It kind of took my breath away,' Harrington told MLive about Day's surprise proposal. The couple plan to wed on October 31 of this year.

In a video that captured the proposal, Day makes several references to the kangaroo's collar being too tight before Harrington spotted the ring. 

Saying the collar was to tight was simply a ruse to get Harrington to find the ring and there was no animal cruelty involved, according to the New York Daily News. 

'You missed it like 20 times,' Day said after he got down on one knee. Harrington said yes and was visibly overwhelmed with emotion. 

Day and Harrington have been dating for five-and-a-half years and have a three-year-old son named Payton together. They've been talking about marriage for the last year, but Harrington didn't know when Day would get down on one knee

A friend of the couple is attempting to start a small zoo and recently came across the baby kangaroo, named Boomer. 

Harrington fell in love with the animal when she spend a few months in Australia when she was 13 years old and was touched by her fiance's special gesture. 

'The fact that he used something so special to me from my past brought back a lot of happy memories and he used that for a day that will be one of the biggest days of our lives,' she said. 

To add another personal touch to the proposal, Day used some familiar stones in Harrington's engagement ring.

'He actually used a stone from my mom's old ring and a stone from his mom's old ring so that made it even more special than what it already was,' Harrington said.
