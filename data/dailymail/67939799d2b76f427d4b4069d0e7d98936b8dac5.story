Ann Holding, 48, hanged herself in a barn in October last year after convincing herself she was pregnant

A mother who convinced herself she was pregnant hanged herself a week after her doctor reassured her she wasn’t expecting.

Ann Holding, 48, hanged herself in a barn after believing she was between three and four months pregnant - despite having just received a negative pregnancy test result.

The cleaner, from Cadbury, Devon, had complained to doctors she felt ‘bloated and had backache’, which she believed were symptoms of being pregnant.

She also told her GP that she ‘felt something moving inside her’ and thought she was three or four months pregnant even though she had a flat abdomen, an inquest into her death heard.

Her husband Steven told the hearing, held at Exeter County Hall today, that her concern may have stemmed from the fact that she did not realise she was pregnant with her daughter, who was born in 1987.

He said: ‘She was wearing size 10 jeans and carried on working.

‘The day before she was banging in some fence stakes and helped me with a mobile disco. It showed what a strong and determined lady she was.’

He also told the hearing how their relationship had been affected in 2012 when his wife started to worry about paying heating bills and keeping warm in their home.

He said she went to bed dressed in clothes and he said he did not ‘attempt sexual advances’ because of her problems but admitted she may have ‘read the wrong thing into it’.

He said his wife had never harmed herself or contemplated suicide before but was found hanged at a barn in Rackenford, Devon, in October last year.

At an inquest at Exeter County Hall (above), Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland recorded a verdict of suicide and said that farmer's daughter Ann Holding was 'increasingly overwhelmed by the pressures of daily living'

Family members said the couple had not been getting on but ‘would not expand any further’.

Her sister said she was ‘busy active person who would never say no to anyone who wanted any help’.

Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland, recording a verdict of suicide, said the farmer’s daughter was ‘increasingly overwhelmed by the pressures of daily living’ and intended to take her own life.
