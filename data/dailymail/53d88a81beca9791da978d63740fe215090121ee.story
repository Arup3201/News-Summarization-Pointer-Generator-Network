A man had an attempted murder of a former employee had his plan foiled after accidentally pocket dialing the intended victim while he was talking about the hit.

Larry Barnett, 68, was arrested in Jonesboro, Arkansas after he 'unknowingly made' a phone call to his former employee.

During the phone call, which lasted an hour and a half, Barnett could be heard telling a different man how he wanted him to do whatever it took to kill the former employee.

Murderous mistake: Larry Barnett unintentionally made his target aware of his plan to kill him by accidentally calling the man on his cell phone as Barnett spoke to the hit man

'I don’t care if you have to burn his house to the ground with him in it.  I don’t care what you have to do, make it look like an accident,' Barnett was heard saying, according to Region 8 News.

Barnett, who owns the Legend Motor Company, also gave specific directions to the target's house in the town of Paragould.

Once he realized what his former boss was plotting, the target- who has not been named- called the police.

The call was still going on when the intended target was speaking to police.

Charged: Jonesboro, Arkansas police arrested Barnett after the intended target, who was Barnett's former employee, called them while he was listening to the plans for the hit

It is not clear where the intended target was at the time of the Thursday incident, but he was not home as police arrived and found that the would-be assassin had clearly made his move.

A police statement from the Jonesboro Police Department makes it clear that the home had been burglarized and the gas stove had been tampered with.

Barnett was arrested on Thursday and charged with conspiracy to commit murder.

He was due in court for a probable cause hearing on Monday.
