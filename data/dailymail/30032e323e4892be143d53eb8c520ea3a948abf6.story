British holidaymakers are saving hundreds of pounds by avoiding traditional travel agents as the value of the euro falls. 

Booking a European trip direct with villa or apartment owners rather than from a brochure can a save a family of four up to £540, The Mail on Sunday found.

The savings come because some tour operators' prices were fixed last summer. But since then the euro has fallen 13 per cent against the pound amid fears of a Greek exit from the single currency.

Savings: Holidaying families are benefiting from a weakened euro and saving up to £540 by booking DIY holidays

Travel Supermarket’s Bob Atkinson said: ‘Britons can get exceptional savings on DIY holidays in Europe due to the strength of the pound versus the euro.’

Thomson and First Choice confirmed that short-term currency fluctuations have little effect on their package prices.

But Noel Josephides, chairman of industry body Abta, warned DIY holidaymakers ‘often have to pay locally, and the exchange rate when they book may be different from when they travel’.

Holidaymakers are also gambling on the strong pound by snapping up currency now, ahead of summer breaks. 

Demand for euros at Debenhams bureaux de change is almost double what it was this time last year.

Since publication of this article, ABTA the Travel Association has issued the following statement: “The holiday market is highly competitive and most companies constantly review their pricing in response to changes in supply and demand. Tour operators tend to bulk buy their foreign currency. Depending on when individual companies have purchased their currency they may be in a position to help customers benefit from improving exchange rates now or there may be a slight delay. By purchasing in advance like this tour operators are able to control their costs and help shield customers from currency fluctuations in the other direction.”
