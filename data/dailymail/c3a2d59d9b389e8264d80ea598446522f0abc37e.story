Naomi Watts: 'I'd watch again and again'

She has already claimed she was given permission from beyond the grave by Diana to play her in a new film.

Now Naomi Watts has revealed she was so determined to make her portrayal of the Princess of Wales perfect that she became obsessed with her controversial Panorama interview with Martin Bashir.

Miss Watts, 44, has admitted she repeatedly watched the 1995 programme – even while she exercised.

‘I ran the Martin Bashir TV interview so often that it got to the point where I was watching it on my iPhone while I was out jogging,’ she told Hello! magazine.

‘I had five minutes of her walk, five minutes of her wave, five minutes of her laugh that I’d watch again and again.

‘She laughed a lot, actually, and had a cheeky sense of humour and would crack jokes you wouldn’t expect a princess to crack.’

The film Diana, which is released next month, focuses on the 18-month relationship the princess – who died in 1997 – had with Pakistan-born heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, following her separation and divorce from Prince Charles.

‘He was someone she trusted right away,’ Miss Watts said. ‘She was fascinated by his mind.

‘He was clever and traditional. She knew he was never going to exploit her.

'People would always be following her: but she did end up finding a connection with this one man. And I think that, despite the tragedy, that’s an uplifting story.

Playing the Princess was, says Watts, her hardest ever role.

‘I kept wondering to myself “Would she like it?”,’ she reveals.

‘So I found myself constantly asking for her permission to carry on.

'I had saturated myself with Diana and her life and I felt this enormous responsibility of playing this iconic woman.

‘It felt like I was spending a lot of time with her. There was one particular moment when I felt her permission was granted. That won’t sound right in print, I know.’

Miss Watts, whose previous film roles have included The Impossible and Mulholland Drive, said she also feared that she was not physically similar enough to Diana.
