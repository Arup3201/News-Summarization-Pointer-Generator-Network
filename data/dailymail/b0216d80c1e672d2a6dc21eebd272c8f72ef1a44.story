Missing: Susan Powell hasn't been seen since December 2009

A remembrance rally for a missing mother-of two descended into chaos on Friday as family members traded allegations in public.

Josh Powell is the only person of interest in the December, 2009 disappearance of his wife, Susan Powell.

Tensions reached a boiling point between the two feuding families as loved ones gathered in Puyallup, Washington to pass out flyers and comb for leads. Steve Powell, Josh Powell's father, confronted Chuck Cox, Susan Powell's father, calling him a 'liar' and a 'cyberbully.'

'Their group has accused me of murdering my daughter-in-law,' Steve Powell told KOMO-TV.

Josh Powell, 34, has maintained that he and his sons were camping in the middle of a blizzard the night his wife went missing from their West Valley, Utah, home on December 6, 2009.

He has claimed that Mrs Powell left on her own, describing his wife to Salt Lake City Tribune as 'extremely unstable.'

Frustrated: Chuck Cox said he had fresh hope when police held a press conference on Friday to announce a tip had led them to Ely, Nevada

Mr Powell responded to the uproar with an emotional plea for his wife's family to leave him and their two sons alone.

He told KOMO-TV: 'Putting this in my neighbourhood is not appropriate. They're trying to push an agenda... I 
don't know what happened to her. There are 1,000 different theories that
people need to consider in strong and serious ways.'

The void left by a lack of credible 
leads in the case has been filled by several public family feuds.

Susan’s father-in-law, Steve Powell, 
read Susan’s diaries and came to the conclusion an emotionally turbulent
upbringing led to her running away with another man.

He even considered publishing extracts from the diary online.

He told ABC4 News: ‘Susan led a very 
troubled childhood where there was emotional abuse at her family's home.
It affected her and her older sister.’

Good news: Husband Josh Powell welcomed the police update, saying it was 'the best news that I've heard in two years'

The allegation led to a furious 
response from Susan’s father, Chuck Cox, who told the news channel: 'We 
deny all allegations, they are just totally ridiculous and we’re very 
disappointed and believe it’s unconscionable that he would first read 
those journals and then think he had the right to publish them.'

Up until now Mr Cox has maintained that his son-in-law is the only focus of investigation in the case.

He added: ‘I don't know of them (the police) moving in any other direction.’

Mr Cox also took aim at investigators for keeping the family in the dark as new leads emerge in the two-year-old case.

He said he had fresh hope when police
held a press conference on Friday to announce a tip had led them to 
Ely, Nevada, where the search for Mrs Powell continues.

But with every search drawing up a 
blank since her 2009 disappearance, Mr Cox said the West Valley, Utah 
police announcement erased his hopes for answers.

Development: Significant new clues have led police to Ely in Nevada, where a team will conduct a search

'I was disappointed in the news 
conference, they didn't tell me anything. That's basically what I 
thought was what's the point?' he asked.

Mr Cox said he has no knowledge of 
his daughter having ever been in the area around Ely, Nevada, where West
Valley police said they would be searching this week after obtaining 
'credible information' from a search warrant led them there.

'I don't know on what basis they're searching that area,' Mr Cox said.

Ely is more than 200 miles southwest of West Valley, where the couple lived with their sons, then ages two and four.

The case has baffled the West Valley 
authorities, but the new evidence that they’ve received was deemed 
important enough to warrant an official statement.

The statement read: ‘A team of West 
Valley Police Department detectives will arrive in Ely, Nevada, and its 
surrounding area, to conduct a search and investigate the information 
received.’

In an interview with KSL.com, Sgt 
Mike Powell (no relation) from West Valley Police added: ‘We've received
some credible information that definitely needs some follow-up. We want
the public to be aware of what's going on.’

Meanwhile, husband Josh Powell welcomed the update, telling King TV it was ‘the best news that I’ve heard in two years’.
