A couple claim they spotted a black panther on the loose in an Essex field, describing it as a ‘big scary cat’.

Lynn Lacy and husband Michael were at home when they allegedly spotted the beast, which they claim was ‘jet black’ and ‘too big’ to be a dog or cat.

Mrs Lacy, 56, took this photo of the unknown animal on her iPhone after she spotted it on the edge of Hatfield Forest yesterday.

Lynn Lacy and husband Michael were at home in Great Hallingbury, Essex, when they allegedly spotted the beast, which they claim was 'jet black' and 'too big' to be a dog or cat

The support worker, from Great Hallingbury, Essex, said: ‘My husband spotted it first - he called me and said “Come and have a look at this”.

‘I looked out and saw a black cat. It looked too big to be a dog or a cat, but too small to be a horse.

‘It had a long tail swishing from side to side. It was jet black, head down and prowling.

‘It was unfamiliar and walked in an unfamiliar way.’

She said the field, near Wall Wood, is normally home to horses and goats but claims there were none in sight when she spotted this animal.

In the photo, the black animal can be seen in a field which is within walking distance to Howe Green House School, a private primary school.

The photograph is not to dissimilar to that of the Essex lion – which sparked a huge search in Clacton August 2012 amidst fears there was a big cat in the wild.

However, after a huge manhunt by police, it turned out the Essex lion was in fact a three-year-old domestic cat called Teddy Bear.

Today, Essex Police confirmed no calls had been made to the force reporting any big cat sightings over the last few days.

It is not the first time locals have claimed to have spotted big cats in the area though.

In 2009, a train driver reported spotting a big cat on the outskirts of Bishop's Stortford, just three miles from Great Hallingbury, and in 2008 a milkman said he spotted a giant cat nearby.

In 2007, one of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey's lambs was savaged at Beckingham Palace, the former home of David and Victoria Beckham, in nearby Sawbridgeworth - six miles from the most recent sighting.

Local Simon Turner, 39, said: ‘The beast is back! Everyone is having a laugh about it, but when it rips your throat it I doubt you'll see the funny side.’
