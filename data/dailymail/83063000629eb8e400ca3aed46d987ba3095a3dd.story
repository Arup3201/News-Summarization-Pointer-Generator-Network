Clermont coach Franck Azema labelled the France rugby team management as 'amateurs' after centre Wesley Fofana was injured during a series of routine physical tests.

Fofana returned to Clermont after picking up a thigh injury.

'They sent me back Wesley Fofana injured. It's frustrating really. I am angry that he gets injured during physical tests,' Azema was quoted as saying on Clermont's website.

Wesley Fofana aggravated his thigh injury during physical tests with the France national team this week

The France centre was preparing ahead of the Autumn internationals against Australia and Argentina

'If he gets injured in training or during a match I don't mind but that it happens during a series of physical tests: it's amateurism.'

Azema added that Clermont had warned the France staff that Fofana had picked up a thigh injury three weeks ago.

Thirty France players gathered for a training camp from Sepember 28 to October 1 to prepare for the November internationals.

France will play Fiji in Marseille on November 8 before taking on Australia at the Stade de France and Argentina in St Denis.
