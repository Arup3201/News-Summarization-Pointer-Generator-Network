Fire: The hot air balloon is seen in the air before it hits the power line and causes a fire

As the hot air balloon strikes the power line in the video, off-screen witnesses shriek as they witness flames erupting.

Multiple voices are heard in the video saying to call 911.

Just moments later, another power line explosion is visible. Onlookers are heard yelling 'Oh my God!'

The hot air balloon is then seen slowly approaching the ground.

'Holy moly,' one man is heard saying.

Up in the air: the second power line explosion is seen here

Almada told WBZ-TV 'We saw it hit the lines and the people calling 911. We're just glad everyone is okay.

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that 'a Colt Balloon was attempting to land in a residential area near Clinton, MA when it struck a power line and caught on fire today at 7:40 p.m.'

A Clinton official told CBS News the balloon's six passengers suffered minor injuries.
