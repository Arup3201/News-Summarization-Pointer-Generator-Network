Whether it’s with his feet, hands, mouth or a combination of the three, Italian musician Moses Concas is a spectacular one-man band.

The Bohemian busker, who uses Moses Breathe as his street or stage name, wowed graffiti artists and tourists this week with an impressive freestyle performance in London’s Leake Street graffiti tunnel.

The Sardinia native showed off his incredible skills by beatboxing while playing the harmonica and, for good measure, crushing plastic bottles under his foot to bring another element of percussion to the performance.

Bystanders were taken by surprise and a few of them began to groove to Mr Concas’ beats while he performed in the pedestrian tunnel under Waterloo Station.

Londoner Mo Elnadi recorded the blues jam while he was attempting to film graffiti artists. 

His video has been viewed thousands of times since it was uploaded Tuesday and shared on several websites. Mr Concas has been based in London since 2013 and has been making music since he was learned to play the piano at the age of three.

The 24-year-old, who began beatboxing at the age of 12, can be found busking in pedestrian zones across the capital.
