Tampa Bay have become the fifth NFL team to get served with a lawsuit from its cheerleaders, it emerged today.

Papers were filed against the Buccaneers by former cheerleader Manouchcar Pierre-Val accusing them of violating federal wage law.

It follows similar actions against the Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and New York Jets filed by cheerleaders claiming they were underpaid.

Manouchcar Pierre-Val alleges that she is owed at least minimum wage for more than 500 hours she worked for the team

In the suit, Pierre-Val's attorney 
Kimberly Woods alleges many of the same facts as those that preceded it 
including unpaid promotional appearances, multiple practices per week, 
and several hundred hours worked for the team, all for a flat per-game 
wage.

Pierre-Val, 25, is a registered nurse from Orlando who cheered for the Bucs during the 2012 to 2013 season, Deadspin.com reported.

During that time, her attorney said, she was paid $100 per game but worked many more unpaid hours leading cheerleading clinics, visiting charity events, posing for swimsuit calendars and practicing.

'If you do the math,' Woods said, 'you see she earned less than $2 per hour — while the minimum wage in Florida was $7.67.'

Pierre-Val¿s suit was filed as a class action, giving other cheerleaders for the team the option of joining the suit against the team

Since January, cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and New York Jets have filed similar 'wage theft' suits

Woods also anticipated the 'you knew what you were getting into' defense, noting that one cannot waive her rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Pierre-Val is the only named plaintiff as of now and was paid $3,000 less than minimum wage during her one year with the team.

Pierre-Val's attorney said she has spoken to other members of the Bucs' cheerleading squad who expressed interest in adding their names, but none have done so at this point
