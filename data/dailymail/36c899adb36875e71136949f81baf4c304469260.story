It was hailed as the next big thing in cinema but it seems Britain’s 3D boom  may be over before it really even began.  

Film fans fed up with inflated prices and disillusioned by the lack of added  value from watching many movies in the format, opted to stick with traditional  2D showings instead.  

Little over a fifth of box office sales were for 3D films in 2011, compared to  27.5 per cent in 2010, according to new figures from global industry analysts  Rentrak EDI.

It had been expected the 3D trend would soar after the success of James Cameron’ s epic Avatar, which made £615 million worldwide, with 90 per cent of the  audience watching in HD, and the huge popularity of Toy Story 3.

But after an initial burst of interest it appears British cinema-goers don’t  feel it represents value for money for every film.  

The major cinema groups charge customers of 3D films up to 41 per cent more than those seeing standard films and many charge an additional £1 for the  special glasses.  

This means families of four face paying nearly £11 more to watch a film in 3D.

‘It is too early to say but it  seems that people are being more discerning and  making decisions on individual films, rather than simply watching everything in  3D,’ a spokesman for the BFI said.

Avatar was a huge hits in the 3D format in the UK in 2010, grossing 67million

Avatar and Toy Story 3 were huge hits in the format in the UK in 2010, grossing  67million and 73.8 million respectively.

By contrast the only standout 3D hit last year was the final film in the Harry  Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, which was the final film in the  franchise and grossed 73 million.  

The rest of the 3D top five for 2011, which included Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, grossed under £30 million.

The research also showed that cinema firms, including Odeon and Cineworld, charge up to £1 per person on top of the ticket price to pay for 3D glasses.

A recent YouGov poll found that almost half of Britons thought the format was 'over-hyped and just a phase.'

Another reason for the slump in interest, is that 2011 saw a rise in the  popularity of character-led films in Britain such as The Kings Speech, which made £45.7 million, and Bridesmaids, which made £23 million, and these do not  need the special technology.

Daily Mail film critic Chris Tookey said that consumers have also wised up to the fact that sum of the '3D films' are simply a rip off.  

He has said: ‘Hollywood has jumped on the 3D bandwagon and is driving it  hell-for-leather.

Another 3D hit, Toy Story 3 made 73.8m in box office sales

‘The irony is that many of the 3D movies that cinema-goers are paying over the odds for aren’t really in 3D at all.’

He pointed to Justin Bieber’s Never Say Never Again, which actually on featured  just 30 minutes of his concert in that format.  

An additional problem is that some people feel unwell when watching in this  format. 

Around 10 per cent of the UK population has poor binocular vision, which means  it is difficult for them to see 3D effects in movies and video games.

Instead, they see a blurry image, and will suffer headaches, eye strain and  even nausea as a result.  

Experts do not recommend allowing children under eight to regularly use 3D  glasses because their eye muscles are still developing.

There are also question marks over whether 3D television will really take off, with some industry figures insisting that until a 'glasses-free, affordable' option is available it is unlikey to.

Some electronics manufacturers have issued disclaimers to protect themselves  from legal claims warning that viewing 3D TV may cause ‘motion sickness’, ‘disorientation’ and ‘eye strain’.

Last year, Sir David Attenborough warned 3D television would not take off in  Britain.  

The veteran, whose documentary for Sky - Flying Monsters - was made in the  format, insisted it would not become the norm for viewers because it was ‘too isolating’.

Instead Sir David said consumers would opt to watch ‘big events’ in 3D such as  World Cup football matches, the forthcoming Royal Wedding, or ground-breaking new nature or history shows.
