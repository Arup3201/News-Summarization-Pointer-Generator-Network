A bigamist whose deception was uncovered when his first wife saw photographs of his second wedding on Facebook has been jailed for three months.

Brian Frain, 36, was caught out when Anne-Marie Sim spotted the pictures while attempting to track him down and tell him she wanted a divorce.

Ms Sim recognised that the 2009 ceremony took place at Dukinfield Register Office in Manchester - the same venue where she had married Frain 10 years previously.

When she contacted the registrar, it was confirmed that Frain had not declared that he was still married.

It later emerged that Margaret Meredith, who thought she was marrying Frain, was also not aware he had wed before.

Rachel Faux, prosecuting, told Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court that Frain’s first marriage had only lasted a couple of months and both parties went their separate ways.

Ms Sim commenced divorce proceedings in 2004 but was unable to make any contact with the defendant through her solicitors.

The prosecutor said: 'Two years ago she contacted her solicitor to see if there had been any progress. She was told there was none and she was still married.

'Because of her own plans to marry that year she undertook her own research on Facebook and found photographs of the defendant being married on September 25, 2009.'

Frain, from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, was arrested and confirmed he had married both women.

'He said due to the amount of time that had passed he assumed he was no longer married to her (Ms Sym),' Ms Faux said.

Ms Meredith told police she was unaware Frain had been married before.

She later had to give evidence at Tameside Magistrates’ Court to confirm she had no knowledge of Frain’s previous life because he claimed she did know.

A district judge ruled she was telling the truth and Frain was convicted of bigamy in August.

The couple, who went on to have twins, later split up themselves. Frain was now in another relationship, the court heard.

His fiancee, mother-of-four Donna Darwent, 33, wept as she vowed to stand by him after he was jailed.

Frain had a string of previous convictions for dishonesty, including benefit fraud, and also violence.

Sentencing him, Judge Maurice Greene said: 'The seriousness of the matter is the distress you caused in the second marriage by giving a status to which she was not entitled to because you lied to her.

'And you also lied to officers of the state. When asked to fill in a form you told a lie to the registrar and you said you had not been married before and was not married, which was not true.'

Frain will serve half his sentence in custody. He has previously reportedly said he wishes to marry his new partner.

Speaking afterwards, his new partner Ms Darwent said: 'I’m absolutely devastated he’s gone to prison but I’m not surprised.

'What I’m most worried about is telling my four kids. I don’t know how I’m going to tell them.

'When this is all dealt with we hope to pick up where we left off and get our lives back.

'I always said I would never marry. But I have never been settled before and never met my perfect partner. Then Brian came along and he has changed completely. My kids love him to bits. They see him as their father. I am committed enough to marry him.'

The sentencing came after Frain himself went public about his cheating saying he could not wait to marry Ms Darwent.

He said: ‘I will take my punishment, because I know when I come out of prison, I will be with the love of my life. I have done the crime, so I have to take the punishment.

'Donna has made me grow up a lot. She has helped me through my ups and downs and made me a better person.

'I want to move on and I plan to marry Donna. I regret all that has happened. I have had to cut all ties with my second wife, which means losing the twins.'
