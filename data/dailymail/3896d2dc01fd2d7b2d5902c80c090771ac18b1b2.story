Trying in vain to cram clothes for all weather conditions into a suitcase before juggling it on a set of scales to check the weight is a scene familiar to many holiday-goers.

But a new product aims to simplify the process with in-built scales, travel tips and much more - and it will even lock itself when you walk away.

Called Bluesmart the carry-on suitcase syncs with an app to provide a host of data for travellers in an attempt to make their journey easier.

A New York team has designed a smart suitcase with built-in technology called Bluesmart (shown). The product syncs with an app to provide a host of functionality including a digital lock, distance alerts, location tracking and statistics on your previous trips

Bluesmart was designed by a team from New York who are currently seeking funding on Indiegogo for the project.

It connects wirelessly via Bluetooth with a user's phone allowing them to lock, unlock, weigh, locate and track the suitcase

Bluesmart is available for £120 ($195) now for early backers on Indiegogo and the team expects to begin shipping in August next year.

It is 21.5” x 14” x 9 inches (54.6 x 35.6 x 22.9cm) in size - approved by all airlines to carry on - and weighs 8.5lbs (3.8kg)

Digital Lock: Users can lock and unlock the suitcase from the phone app. The proximity sensors automatically lock the bag when it is separated from the user.

Digital Scale: Users are able to see the exact weight of the suitcases on the app and whether it’s approved by the airline to carry on.

Distance Alerts: Users are notified on their smartphones via SMS when they are leaving their suitcases behind, avoiding losses or thefts.

Location Tracking: With GPS technology Bluesmart tracks the location of the suitcase and helps you find it when lost or re-routed.

Trip Stats and Data: Users are able to see trends in their travel habits (miles travelled, airports visited, time per state/country) and sync with other services for smart notifications and reminders.

Battery charger: Users can recharge their electronic devices up to six times while on the go.

A built-in battery charger can also be used to fully charge devices six times over.

Entering your flight details in the app will provide you with numerous updates on your flight such as its current status.

The app will also check the weather at your destination and tell you the sorts of things you'll need to pack.

Lifting up the handle, meanwhile, will activate the scales that are built into the suitcase –- with the weight displayed on the app.

A lock and unlock feature is also built into the suitcase; proximity sensors detect if you have walked away and automatically lock it when you’re not nearby.

Another bugbear of travellers is the moment a bag gets re-routed, leaving the person stranded in a new destination with none of their belongings.

The location software in the suitcase, though, shows you where the bag is at any given moment so it can be found when lost or re-routed.

Users can also see their travel habits including miles travelled, airports visited and time spent in each country with the app.

'We came up with the idea for Bluesmart after suffering a couple of bad experiences with our luggage, when airlines forced us to check bags only to have them mishandled or lost,' said Tomi Pierucci, co-founder of Bluesmart.

'We realised that with all the amazing technology available today, we could do better.

'Suitcases haven’t seen much innovation in decades, so we decided to design a suitcase for this century.'

Proximity sensors lock the suitcase when they detect you have walked away, or it can also be locked manually through the app (shown). GPS tells you where your bag is if it gets re-routed to another flight, and a built-in battery can charge your smartphone six times over

Lifting the handle activates interior scales that weigh the suitcase (shown). It will also give you tips on what clothes to take to your destination. The team are currently seeking £31,000 ($50,000) on Indiegogo for Bluesmart, and they expect to start shipping in August 2015
