A supermarket price war on an unprecedented scale was under way last night with the prospect of permanent cuts in the cost of many basic foods.

It was triggered as Morrisons announced discounts worth £1billion over the next three years in a bid to fight off budget rivals Aldi and Lidl.

Asda responded immediately with an advertising campaign claiming to undercut Morrisons and promising big savings on major brands.

Trouble: Morrisons is set to slash its prices after recording a loss of £176million last year

Tesco and Sainsbury’s will almost certainly be forced to follow suit.

The
 cost of some everyday essentials could fall by up to a quarter as the 
‘big four’ take on Aldi and Lidl, who have grabbed a huge chunk of their
 market share in recent years in what has been the biggest change in 
grocery shopping habits since the dawn of the supermarket age more than 
50 years ago.

Last night 
Aldi raised the stakes further with a promise to save shoppers 35 per 
cent on their weekly shop.

Fears of the effect of a price war on profits
 gripped the City yesterday, wiping £2billion of the combined share 
value of Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.

Morrisons
 shares were down more than 10 per cent at one point. Profits at Asda, 
which is part of the world’s biggest retailer, US giant Walmart, are 
also likely to suffer.

Bosses
 at Morrisons believe only a fundamental shift to lower prices will 
guarantee the chain’s future after it posted losses of £176million.

Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury’s all pledge they will match Morrisons prices,
 so will inevitably be drawn into a price war.

Tesco
 has made its own price cuts in recent weeks, with the cost of a 
four-pint carton of milk cut from £1.39 to £1 and reductions on some 
fruit and vegetables.

Battle: Aldi and Lidl have been gaining in market share thanks to increasingly price-conscious customers

Tesco’s cuts had already seen it promise £200million in short-term savings but will now have to go much further.

Retail experts at one City firm described the scale of the reductions promised by Morrisons as like ‘getting the bazooka out’.

The
 firm, founded in Bradford in 1899, admitted that the price cuts will 
hit profits by more than £300million a year over the next three years.

But
 chief executive Dalton Philips said the ‘big four’ chains had lost 
millions of customers and billions of pounds in sales to Aldi and Lidl, 
and needed to catch up.

The 
grocery sector is facing the biggest structural shift ‘since the 1950s 
and the advent of supermarkets’ as shoppers – even those not struggling 
financially – turn to budget stores, he said.

‘The biggest challenge 
that we face is that there has been a fundamental change in how 
consumers view discounters.

‘They are no longer going to them out of 
necessity. The perception has changed and there is a new price norm.’

A
 study suggested this week that the big four have lost sales worth 
£4.4billion a year over the past three years.

The cost of living squeeze
 saw millions of middle-income shoppers switch to the budget chains – 
and many have stayed.

Sales 
at Morrisons are down by 3.2 per cent in the past year, while Aldi’s are
 up a remarkable 33.5 per cent and Lidl’s 16.5 per cent.

Mr
 Philips said: ‘We are going to lower our prices on a permanent 
basis.The rules have changed and we must change too. It is absolutely 
critical that we begin winning again in our core supermarkets. To do 
that we must compete on price.’

The money to cover the loss in profits will come partly from the sale of property thought to be worth £1billion.

A
 snapshot survey of prices at Morrisons and Aldi yesterday, suggests it 
will have to make significant reductions to match its German-owned 
budget rival.

Plunge: The company's share price fell by 10 per cent this morning after the loss was announced

For example, Aldi charges £5 for a 200g jar of Nescafe 
Gold Blend, which is £6.58 at Morrisons and the other mainstream chains.

A large white sliced loaf is just 55p at Aldi versus 65p at Morrisons 
and anything up to £1 at the other giants.

A
 500g pack of fusilli pasta is 49p, against 95p, while a 1kg bag of 
basmati rice is £1.29, compared with £1.79. A 500g box of corn flakes is
 99p at Aldi versus £1.45 at Morrisons.

Morrisons
 is to press ahead with the roll-out of its online shopping service and 
the opening of small convenience stores in a bid to catch up with its 
major rivals, who have cashed in by offering home deliveries and filling
 high streets and petrol stations with smaller stores.

Its
 annual loss of £176million included one-off costs of £903million.

But 
underlying profits were down 13 per cent to £785million and these are 
expected to fall by more than half to fund the price cuts.

David
 Cumming of Standard Life, who is responsible for investing billions of 
pounds of pension funds, said: ‘Investors know a price war is coming.

‘Aldi
 and Lidl are growing shares at double digit while the majors are losing
 market share and they have to do something about it. If they are 
relatively expensive – and the customers know it – they need a price 
reset, or price war, whatever you want to call it, before they can move 
forward in terms of sales.’

Richard
 Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: 
‘The discount supermarkets have become a thorn in the side for the 
bigger players.

‘Morrison’s has now decided that it is time to revitalise the business, which will inevitably come at a cost.’

The
 reputation of Aldi and Lidl were enhanced last night as both picked up 
prizes at the Oracle Retail Week Awards. Lidl won own brand range of the
 year, while Aldi was named retailer of the year.

Success: Morrisons expanded under the watch of Sir Ken Morrison, son of the firm's founder

Morrisons is one of the country's oldest supermarkets, having started trading as a market stall in Bradford, West Yorkshire in 1899.

However, it did not become a major player on a national scale until a decade ago, when it took over the Safeway supermarket chain.

The company, whose full title is Wm Morrison, was named after its founder William Morrison, who sold egg and butter in Bradford's Rawson Market.

Its major expansion came under the founder's son, Sir Ken Morrison, who took over in 1952 at the age of 21 and remains president of the company.

He opened Bradford's first modern-style grocery store, and in 1967 floated the firm on the London Stock Exchange.

In 2004, Morrisons expanded beyond its home region by buying Safeway and taking over its stock of nearly 500 stores.

The company now operates more than 550 branches around the UK, and is the country's fourth-biggest supermarket with a market share of around 11 per cent.

However, it has run into difficulties in recent years after being crowded out by discount retailers and the rise of online shopping.
