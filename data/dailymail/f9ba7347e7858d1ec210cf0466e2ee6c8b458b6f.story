Many little girls dream of owning their very own doll's house, complete with tiny rooms and quaint model furniture.

But when one little girl asked her father for a doll's house, she was in for a long wait as the elaborate home created by her father took him more than three decades to complete.

Geoffrey Walkley, 69, from Hornchurch in Essex, took 35 years to finish the project, which is a replica of the National Trust's 18th century Rainham Hall.

Labour of love: Geoffrey Walkley and his daughter Sarah with the incredible doll's house that took 35 years to build

Weighing a whopping 200 pounds and costing more than Â£13,000 , it has 13 rooms over three storeys including five bedrooms, library, kitchen, dining room, marble hall and a utility room.

A remote controls the individually wired light switches, six of the 14 chimneys are linked to a smoke generator, both front and back doors have a doorbell, while in a modern twist, the home includes an iPad Nano which powers the speaker in the music room.

Sarah Walkley, now aged 40, was five years old when she asked her father for the doll's house on Christmas Eve 1978.

'My mum was tucking me in and I said I wanted a doll's house from Father Christmas,' explains Sarah.

'She said he had packed his sleigh and left the Arctic but she went downstairs and mentioned it to my dad and he said he was going to build one.'

Devoted father Geoffrey agreed but came up with a blueprint so ambitious, Sarah says she began to lose hope of ever seeing it finished.

'I thought it would take a few years,' says Sarah. 'Once he started it became very clear that was not going to be the case.

'By the time I got to my teenage years, it had become a bit of a running joke - I used to say, "Will it ever get finished?"

'As an adult I could see there was progress. My dad always said I was incredibly patient.'

But the years of slow progress were about to come to an end when Geoffrey retired from his job as a city lawyer in the city in 2004.

With a new role as a part-time consultant, the loving father was able to devote at least 35 hours a week to the project.

Sarah, who
 lives with her husband Mark, 38, an electric engineer, in their 
five-bedroom home in Bromley, Kent, joked: 'Once he retired he swapped 
one full time job for another full time job. He would spend every day from 10am to 4pm in his workshop'

Clever: The library is decked out in dark wood and has shelves filled with books as well as a globe

Intricate: The attic contains two servant's bedrooms complete with jugs and bowls for washing

Imposing: A tiny cat sits in the main hallway of the house, which comes complete with a tiled floor

Despite the progress he was making, Sarah says there were moments when her father's temper almost got the better of him.

'There was certainly lots of times he wanted to take a hammer to it because he was annoying him,' she revealed. 'He had to stop what he was doing and come back later.

'By
 the time he finished it he was probably sick of the sight of it. He did
 not really appreciate it until a few weeks later when he saw it again.'

The finished result, however, proved a stunning surprise. 'It's indescribable really, to spend that much of your life on one project, it's a real token of love and dedication.'

Describing her friends' reactions, she added: 'They think it's absolutely amazing and a little bit eccentric.

'They
 have never really seen a doll's house like it. Most people's 
perceptions of a dolls house is a basic wooden Sylvanian Families house. This is a real work of art.'

All there: The dining room has crystal port and wine decanters and a case of silverware waiting on the sideboard

Play: The nursery is packed with handmade toys, among them a rocking horse and a tiny Ark

She added: 'I've spent a couple of Friday nights sitting with a glass of wine and just marvelling at it.'

The 42 x 39 inch house now has pride of place in her home, although she did have to hire a van to bring it home from her father's workshop.

'It took four grown adults to lift it,' explains Sarah. 'My dad was sat in the back [directing operations] with a walkie talkie.'

After getting it home, the family threw a party to celebrate its arrival and give Geoffrey a chance to reflect on his achievement.

'I was desperately proud of it,' he revealed. 'I thought, "Wow, how stunning!"'

But while Geoffrey's doll's house has proved a hit with his daughter, it might be the last one built by a family member.

'My sister in law's husband said he started building one,' adds Sarah, 'but he said he may as well give up now.'

Pride of place: The house is now the centrepiece of Sarah's own home and has proved a hit with the whole family
