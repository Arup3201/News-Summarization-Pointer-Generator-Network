The last surviving Nazi officer to take part in the Greek island massacre that formed the backdrop to  'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' has been handed a full life sentence.

Wermacht corporal Alfred Stork was convicted of ordering the slaughter of 117 Italian officers on the Greek island of Cephalonia in 1943.

The senseless slaughter, which continued for days, was immortalised in the bestselling 1994 novel, a love story about a Greek girl and an Italian officer, which became a film starring Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz.

The killings formed part of a mass reprisal by Nazi troops after Italy changed sides during the war.

In
 Italian-occupied Cephalonia, the Italian general gave his troops three 
options, telling them to follow their conscience: fight on with Germany,
 surrender or resist.

Five 
thousand Italian prisoners were shot dead after they had surrendered and
 another 1,300 died in fighting. 3,000 drowned when a ship carrying them
 to Nazi concentration camps sank.

The
 bodies of 200 men were tossed down a well, from which they were only 
recovered and sent back home a few months before former Italian 
president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi visited the island in 2001.

Stork was not present in court for the sentence and in any case would not serve time in jail in Italy because of his age.

Tragic: The film, and book, follows the exploits of Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain with the Acqui Division which refused to surrender to the Germans, fighting for nine days before running out of ammunition. Some 1,500 Italian soldiers died in the fighting while 5,000 were massacred after surrendering

Military
 prosecutor Marco De Paolis said: 'He did not have the courage to 
maintain his admission of guilt and stayed comfortably in his home in 
Germany.'

The prosecution was barred from submitting a 2005 confession by Stork because he made it with no defence lawyer present.

In it he allegedly told German prosecutors
 he was part of two execution platoons that killed the Italians 
because they were 'considered traitors’.

De Paolis 
said: ‘All the German soldiers present in Cephalonia, and also Stork, 
were fully aware that the order received to kill the prisoners was 
illegal, an order which it was their duty not to obey.’

In his submissions the prosecutor argued that Stork’s guilt is already determined by witnesses who identified his platoon as the executioners.

But he said that the case had been a struggle because fellow officers who are still alive would not incriminate Stork.

'There is a disgusting code of silence,' he said.

Stork
 deserved the full life term, he said, 'in view of the extreme gravity 
of the crime, the cruelty with which it was carried out, the total 
disregard for the victims and the refusal of the accused to cooperate in
 any way with the courts.'

The reasons for the verdict and sentence will be published in anything up to three months.
