They are vital ingredients of a traditional Christmas dinner.

But a former school dinner lady has found an alternative festive use for Brussels sprouts, parsnips, chestnuts, carrots and cranberries, which she hopes will help her become one of the nation’s favourite bakers.

The ‘Christmas Dinner Cake’ is the latest bizarre creation of cake-making entrepreneur Allison Whitmarsh, who has gone from strength to strength after appearing on the BBC’s Dragon’s Den programme almost a year ago.

Mother-of-two Miss Whitmarsh, 46, successfully pitched her unusual cake on the Christmas show and secured £50,000 funding from Dragon Deborah Meaden in return for a 25 per cent stake in her business.

The cake, which includes almost everything on the Christmas dinner plate apart from Turkey and gravy, is now available through the online supermarket Ocado for £18.

Her Huddersfield-based company Propermaid hopes to sell 2,000 of the cakes this season.

Miss Whitmarsh said: ‘It’s gone down 
really well. People dread it at first and then there’s the look of 
surprise when they taste it. It’s a sweet cake, a bit like carrot cake.’

Other cake creations from her kitchen have included courgette & lime, beetroot & chocolate, liquorice, dandelion & burdock and chocolate chilli & fudge.

‘We do the traditional cakes too, but I think people want something different,’ she said.

Miss Whitmarsh’s transformation from dinner lady to cake entrepreneur began when she received a grant to do a Hospitality Management degree at Huddersfield University.

She formed her company as part of her degree project and then turned it into a successful business after she graduated in 2008.

When she appeared on the Dragon’s Den last December her company had a turnover of around £250,000.

With the help of the new funding – which she invested in much-needed equipment – Propermaid has doubled its turnover since.

The company now employs 22 people and produces between 200 and 300 cakes a day.

The Great British Bake Off has helped to inspire the country to have-a-go at baking and Miss Whitmarsh is doing her bit too.

‘I got taught baking at school, but it has become a lost skill,’ she said.

She honed her cake-making skills years ago by swapping recipes with other mothers after dropping her children off at school.

And seeing her Christmas Dinner Cake being sold nationwide for the first time ‘is literally a dream come true.’

Deborah Meaden said: ‘Allison is a tremendous example of how entrepreneurs with great ideas, excellent products, a sound business model and the passion and drive to succeed can quickly make a difference in business, as well as in their local communities.’
