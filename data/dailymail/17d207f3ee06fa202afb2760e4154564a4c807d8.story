Energy bills have almost  doubled since 2000, turning up the heat on Britain’s already hard-pressed families.

Households last year spent an  average of £1,339 on gas and electricity – 85 per cent more than the £710 at the turn of the century, research shows.

The figures – adjusted to 2012 prices to take inflation into account – show that gas bills went up by 119 per cent and electricity bills by 47 per cent between 2000 and last year.

British Gas are the worst offenders, with prices 8 per cent higher on average than their newer rivals

Utility firms have been accused of raking in massive profits as customers struggle to make ends meet. In the past two years alone, gas bills surged by 19 per cent and electricity by 11 per cent.

The worst offenders are British Gas and the former regional electricity monopolies, according to the study by the House of Commons Library.

More than 20 years after privatisation, they are still charging far more than their rivals, it says.

British Gas charges 8 per cent more for gas than the average bill from their newer rivals, researchers said. The figures came as it emerged the firm was planning another price rise before winter.

High energy prices are particularly devastating for older people, who often live off modest pensions. In recent years, hypothermia cases have been on the rise as the worst-off are forced to choose between heating or eating.

Experts warn that prices could rise further in coming years thanks to the Coalition’s green policies.

Last year ministers admitted electricity prices were 15 per cent higher than they should be, thanks to Government charges to fund renewable energy projects.

Tom Lyon, of the moneysaving website uSwitch.com, said last night: ‘It’s vital that everyone shops around to find the best deal.

‘With £231 between the cheapest and the most expensive deals,  consumers have the power to cut their bills in time for winter and make sure they aren’t paying more than they should be.

‘Unfortunately, consumer apathy and loyalty end up costing them, but benefiting suppliers. Consumers must vote with their feet.’

British Gas is preparing to introduce an inflation-busting price rise just before winter.

The increase could come next month even though the company pledged earlier this year to use a profits windfall from the cold weather to keep a lid on tariffs.

British Gas, which supplies 12million homes, is planning an increase that could add £100 a year to family energy bills.

The average dual fuel bill will rise from £1,232 to more than £1,300 if, as expected, the company brings in an increase of 8 per cent – almost four times the level of inflation.

It is understood that British Gas has begun preparing to print flyers to send to customers warning of the increase.

Last December the firm increased prices by 6 per cent, and benefited after gas use soared by 18 per cent during the bitterly cold winter.

In May, parent company Centrica, run by chief executive Sam Laidlaw, pledged to use its increased profits ‘to effectively hold prices for as long as possible’.

Critics branded the planned price rise a ‘slap in the face for consumers’.

All the prices in the Commons research have been converted to 2012 prices so they can be compared without being skewed by inflation.

It shows that in 2000, the average domestic gas bill was £383, when adjusted to 2012 prices, more than doubling to £839 in 2012.

It was a similar story for electricity bills, which were £341 in 2000, soaring by a half to £500 in 2012.

Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, said: ‘The Government must get behind Labour’s plans to break the dominance of the energy giants, protect the public from being ripped off and create a tough watchdog with the power to force companies to cut prices when costs fall.’

British Gas queried the report, saying it was based on figures from the energy watchdog Ofgem that do not take into account its customers’ lower-than-average energy usage.

A spokesman added: ‘Our customers’ energy consumption is much lower than that of the  average energy customer due to the steps we’ve taken to make our customers’ homes more energy efficient and help them manage their energy usage.’

A spokesman for Energy UK, which represents energy providers, said: ‘Britain’s energy prices are relatively low compared to most European countries.

‘Companies try and cushion price rises for customers, but becoming more reliant on imported gas has meant prices have become increasingly influenced by global events.’

The Department for Energy and Climate Change said the forthcoming Energy Bill would help customers, adding: ‘The Bill will ensure that all consumers are on the cheapest tariff to suit their needs.

‘This means getting people off poor-value tariffs, cutting the number of tariffs and giving consumers clear personalised information on their bills so they can compare and switch.’
