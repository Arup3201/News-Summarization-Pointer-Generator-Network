Dusty textbooks and scraps of unfinished homework are the only signs of life left inside a boarding school which was abandoned following claims of child abuse.

The corridors, classrooms and library in Crookham Court Manor School have been empty for more than 20 years.

The library is still full of books and unfinished homework assignments can be seen scattered throughout the derelict boarding school in Berkshire.

The school has been abandoned since 1989. It was shut down after it was at the centre of a series of high-profile child abuse cases.

Photographer Darren Finch, 26, entered through an open window and was careful not to disturb the dilapidated interior.

He said: 'I felt emotional as I walked around. I wondered what terrible things had happened in the rooms which are now eerily empty. It's horrible to even imagine'

The school was the subject of a 1988 BBC investigation for the television programme That's Life which led to three members of staff being convicted of sexual abuse.

In 1990 the owner of the school, Philip Cadman, was sentenced to ten years in prison after a trial at Reading Crown Court.

French teacher, William Printer, was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and one attempted serious sexual assault, and was imprisoned for 10 years at the same trial. Cadman's and Printer's sentences were both reduced to six years on appeal.

Anthony Edmonds, who taught English at the school, was jailed for six years after admitting to four charges of serious sexual assault and seven charges of indecent assault.

In 2012 a fourth member of staff was convicted of four counts of indecent assault. Mark Standish was found guilty of incidents which took place between 1988 and 1989.

The original manor, near Thatcham, was built in 1729.

The house was demolished in the early 19th century and the current buildings were built on same site in 1850.

Several copies of the New Testament left in the school. The site was originally home to a different manor, built 1729 - which was demolished in the early 19th century

The building served several purposes over the years. It was at one point a school for children of members of the armed forces serving at RAF Greenham Common.

It was abandoned for some time after the US Air Force left the area before the manor was purchased in 1961 and reopened as an independent boarding school for boys.

Mr Finch, who visited the property last April, said he tried to look past the building's troubled history and appreciate the architecture.

He said: 'If you can put the bad stuff behind you and look at the building, you can appreciate it as a very nice structure.

'The architecture is very impressive and the building looked quite peaceful when the light came through the stained glass windows.

'I had mixed feelings about the place - it was both peaceful and disturbing.'

Since 2012 there have been plans to redevelop Crookham Court Manor House and more than ten acres of land which surround it.
