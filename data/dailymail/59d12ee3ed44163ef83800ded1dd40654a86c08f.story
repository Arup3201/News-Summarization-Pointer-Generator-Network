A terrorist act in Martin Place was allegedly the plan of accused Sydney man, Omarjan Azari, who is due to make a bail application this week in Central Local Court, just  blocks away from the Lindt cafe.

It was alleged that 22-year-old Azari,who was arrested on terrorism charges in September, was planning a public beheading in Martin Place.

The alleged terror plot, mentioned in a conversation between Australian terrorism recruiter in Syria, Mohammad Ali Baryalei and Azari, involved selecting a member of the public at random, beheading them and then covering their body in an Islamic flag.

Raids were carried out all over Sydney and in Brisbane by counter terrorist police who made more than a dozen arrests of young men

The whole incident was allegedly going to be filmed, and then used as propaganda for the ISIS cause.

Azari was arrested on September 18 and charged with preparing for an act of terrorism. Police took him into custody at his parents' home in a series of raids on September 18.

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call between Azari and Baryalei - who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East - two days before the raid. 

There is only one God: the flag used in the Martin Place raid on Monday (pictured) belongs to the group Jabhat al-Nusra which is fighting the Assad government regime in Syria
