A violin handed into a lost property office by a member of the public turned out to be a multimillion-pound Stradivarius.

The owner of the instrument loaned it to a friend last week and the hapless musician left it on a train in Bern, Switzerland.

Police officers made an appeal to the public to find the valuable violin and released CCTV footage showing a passenger walking off with it at a different station.

Strings attached: The Stradivarius is one of the most expensive items ever handed into a lost property office

Luckily for the owner and his terrified friend, the violin became one of the most expensive items ever handed into a lost property office on Sunday.

The police are refusing to give a value on the violin, which is thought to be worth millions of pounds, with the Stradivarius  regarded as the 'Mona Lisa' of stringed instruments.

Antonio Stradivari, who lived from 1644 to 1737, is the world's most famous luthier [stringed instrument maker] and is thought to have made around 1,100 instruments during his career.

There are thought to be just 600 left, with the fabled violins attracting global interest on the rare occasions they come onto the market.

Last year, a 1721 Stradivarius dubbed the 'Lady Blunt' fetched a world record £9.8million with all proceeds going to victims of the Japanese tsunami.

A 1716 Stradivari known as the 'Messiah' was bequeathed to The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, on the condition it can never be played.

In 2008, US violinist Philippe Quint left a 290-year-old Stradivari worth £2.5m in the back of a New York taxi.

The honest cab driver, Mohamed Khalil, got in touch the next day to return it - and Mr Quint gave him £50 and a 30-minute private performance as a reward.

In another mishap in May, an extremely rare Stradivarius cello worth around £13million is reported to have broken while it was being handled by experts during a photoshoot at the Spanish Royal Palace in Madrid.

Scientists recently spent two years using 1,000 x-ray images and high-tech computer-aided carving tools to 'recreate' the famous instrument.

Antonio Stradivarius, history's greatest violin-maker, made around 1,000 cellos, violins lutes, mandolins, guitars and harps in 17th and 18th century Italy.

They are considered the finest instruments ever made, with a uniquely sweet sound that still sets the standard today.

The superior quality is thought to have been obtained using a specific density of wood; with shape, arching and wood thickness also important.

Today, Stradivarius instruments are prized possessions housed in museums and personal collections around the world.

About 650 still exist and they are highly prized for their beautiful form and sound.
