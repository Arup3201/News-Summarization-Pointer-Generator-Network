Vincent Kompany is almost certain to miss Manchester City’s Champions League group decider at Roma.

The skipper suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday’s 3-0 win at Southampton and missed Wednesday’s 4-1 victory at Sunderland.

He is out of this weekend’s visit of Everton and is unlikely to make the squad for the trip to the Italian capital next Wednesday.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini said: ‘Vincent is improving and maybe the injury wasn’t as serious we thought at the beginning. 

‘He needs this whole week to see what happens. I don’t think we will see him against Everton on Saturday. I don’t know if he has a chance to play against Roma, we will see.

‘Sometimes those types of injuries can be a month out, but it’s still difficult for him to recover in 10 days.’
