Beaten to death: Father-of-two James Tierney

Two drunken youths who beat an innocent father-of-two to death - simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time - have been jailed for 15 and 12 years.

James Tierney had taken a shortcut home from his girlfriend's flat when he was cornered by hooded thugs Dale Duncan and Aisar Khan.

The pair challenged the 41-year-old to a fight and, when he refused, launched a savage beating.

They repeatedly hit Mr Tierney over the head with a piece of drainpipe which had been ripped from a nearby wall and, as their victim begged for mercy, they stamped on his face before he slipped into unconsciousness and they left him to die.

Mr Tierney, a tyre fitter, suffered multiple broken bones in his face, a broken voicebox and a brain haemorrhage. He was pronounced dead later in hospital.

Tests revealed it was most likely that the brain haemorrhage that killed him, but doctors said he could also have been a heart attack induced by having his voicebox crushed, or he may have drowned in his own blood.

Khan and Duncan were today convicted of murder and jailed for life. Khan must serve a minimum 15 years whilst Duncan will serve 12 years before being considered for parole.

Mr Justice Alan Wilkie told them: 'You both attacked this man despite him pleading to go home. You pursued him and cornered him and attacked him with whatever came to hand and beat him to death.

'Your victim was vulnerable, he was alone in the streets at 5am and in no state to prevent an attack from two fired up, young men like you.'

The tragedy occurred last April after Mr Tierney had been visiting his girlfriend, Tracy Johnson, in the Farnworth area of Bolton, Greater Manchester.

He was taking a shortcut home at 5am when he accidentally bumped into Khan and Duncan who had been drinking at a nearby late night house party.

It is believed Mr Tierney has asked to be let past but the hoodies were said to have 'taken offence' at his request and launched a vicious attack.

One neighbour woken up by the noise, looked out of his bedroom window to see Duncan rip a drainpipe from the wall of a house and then use both hands to swing it repeatedly at Mr Tierney as he pleaded for mercy, shouting 'I want to go home'.

Damian Bentley, 22, told Manchester Crown Court: 'I opened the window as he was ripping the drainpipe off the wall because I was trying to stop him from ripping it off our property.

'I banged on it once to try and stop him, but he ignored me. The drainpipe broke in half as he ripped it off the wall. He then brandished it as a weapon and started swinging it.

'He tried to swing it as hard as he could to make as much impact as possible. The victim was shielding himself with his arms over his head, trying to stop the drainpipe from hitting him.'

The jury heard that patterned bruises on Mr Tierney's face matched the sole of Duncan's trainers. His head was stamped on at least four times and he was also hit with an unknown rod-like object as well as the drainpipe.

He suffered 25 injuries in total to his face, head and neck.

Khan and Duncan were arrested later. Khan intially said he was so drunk he had no recollection of the attack.

But in court he claimed in the run up to the attack he had spent the afternoon drinking and playing arcade games at the Trafford Centre before meeting Duncan then going partying with friends.

He blamed Duncan for starting the attack on Mr Tierney and also claimed the victim had racially abused him and tried to punch him.

Duncan said he only stamped on Mr Tierney's face because Khan had told him to 'do him in'.

He said: 'Aisar punched him, then he fell on the floor. Aisar punched him while he was on the floor, and stamped on him. On his face.

'Aisar told me to come and do him in. I went and copied what he did. Because Aisar told me to. I was scared because of what me and Aisar had done.'

Duncan, of Bolton Road, Farnworth who was said to have the literacy and numeracy skills of a six to eight-year-old pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but not guilty to murder.

Khan, of Devon Street, Farnworth, pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter.

In a statement Mr Tierney's sister Maureen Cassidy said: 'I am aware of when I see someone who resembles James and then all the same thoughts keep rushing back.

'This is having a massive impact on my own life. They took the life of a father from his two children. They are both devastated by the loss of their dad.'

Sharon Stone, mother of Mr Tierney's children - Bradley, now aged 18 and Elise, 16 - said: 'His presence would put smiles on the children's faces, they craved their father constantly.

'Now the children are very scared and angry with the people who have done this to him. They do not understand why this had happened. They were unable to hold their fathers hand for the last time.

'I found the funeral extremely upsetting because these children have had their father stolen from them. Having to prepare your children for their father's funeral is awful but having to prepare them for their father's murder trial is something no mother should have to do.'
