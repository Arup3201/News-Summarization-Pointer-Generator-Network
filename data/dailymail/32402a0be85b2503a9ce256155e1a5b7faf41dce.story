Obama is quietly forming a coalition to support airstrikes on ISIS in Syria after the execution of US journalist James Foley, according to a report on Wednesday. 

Obama said Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina that his Defense and State Departments are 'urging countries in the region and building an international coalition, including our closest allies, to support Iraqis as they take the fight to these barbaric terrorists.'

He did not specifically mention recruiting partners for bombing raids over Syrian air space. 

But The New York Times reported hours later, citing unnamed sources, that the U.S. was engaged in a 'diplomatic campaign to enlist allies and neighbors in the region to increase their support for Syria’s moderate opposition and, in some cases, to provide support for possible American military operations.'

Whose planes? President Obama has authorized surveillance flights over Syria, a move that could pave the way for US airstrikes against ISIS militant targets -- and for international coalition-building at the State Department

'A cancer': Obama boasted Tuesday that an international coalition of willing partners would help root out ISIS once and for all

The Times named seven countries 'likely to be enlisted': Australia, Britain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

The White House this week began facing tough questions about whether it would pursue ISIS into Syria as part of a plan that has so for focused exclusively on hamstringing its fighters in Iraq.

A knowledgeable State Department source would not confirm that any country has been asked to provide materiel, personnel or logistical support for any U.S. military mission operating in or over Syria.

International coalition-building has become the most recognizable hallmark of Obama's foreign policy. 

He warned Tuesday in his lackluster and sparsely applauded address at the America Legion's annual convention that 'history teaches us of the dangers of overreaching, and spreading ourselves too thin, and trying to go it alone without international support.'

'In times of crisis,' the president preened, 'no other nation can rally such broad coalitions to stand up for international norms and peace.'

According to the Times, Britain and Australia are the most likely nations to step up first, followed by Turkey, whose military bases near its long Syrian border would be invaluable for staging, refueling and supplies.

But Obama also branded ISIS 'a cancer,' bragging that 'tyrants and murderers before them should recognize that kind of hateful vision ultimately is no match for the strength and hopes of people who stand together for the security and dignity and freedom that is the birthright of every human being.'

That laid-on-thick rhetoric suggests either a confidence that a coalition will materialize, or a brazen acknowledgment that America will be left to bomb ISIS on its own in Syria – as it has already in Iraq.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on August 21 that ISIS 'can be contained,' but 'not in perpetuity.'

'This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,' Dempsey said.

'Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.'

The administration appears to be gearing up for airstrikes, and floated  the case of the Turkmen to the Times.

The al-Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) operates both in Iraq and in Syria (shown), and moves personnel and materiel freely across the invisible border between the two countries

About 12,000 of the Shiite ethnic group inhabit the Iraqi town of Amerli, which ISIS has been attacking for the last two months. ISIS, a Sunni group, sees the Turkmen as infidels, and its militants have indiscriminately killed countless of them.

Like the Yezidis before them on Mt. Sinjar, the group is a ready-made rationale for American humanitarian assistance and airborne offensives. And according to the World Population Review, between 750,000 and 1.5 million Turkmen live in Syria.

A State Department source said he couldn't reject the possibility that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Syria could be framed as those near Mt. Sinjar were, as an effort to protect an oppressed group.

The Pentagon has already begun to send surveillance drones on flights over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIS's positions and troop strength.

Bashar al-Assad, Syria's strong-arm dictator, has warned that the U.S. must ask permission before intruding into his country's airspace for any reason, including strikes against ISIS.  

Tensions between Washington and Damascus could worsen if the U.S. were to insert itself into Syria. 

While ISIS has taken up arms against Assad in a bloody civil war that has raged since 2011, so have the Turkmen. Weakening one while strengthening the other is likely not the dictator's idea of a good outcome.

But State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki insisted during a press conference on Tuesday that 'we're not going to ask permission from the Syrian regime.'

New York Times report suggests Obama won't go it alone if he attacks ISIS inside Syria's borders

@highlight

ISIS oppression of Shi'ite Turkmen group in Iraq could be a rationale for striking the terror group as it attacks Turkmen in Syria

@highlight

Britain, Australia and Turkey are mentioned as  allies who might 'support' the White House, but Obama has no confirmed takers

@highlight

There are no direct indications that 'coalition' partners would actually engage ISIS from the air along with Americans

The US government also won't confirm that any nation has agreed to back the White House if Obama pursues ISIS into Syria
