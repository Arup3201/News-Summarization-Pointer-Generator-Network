A furniture website has come up with the perfect solution for nosy neighbours - by offering 'virtual tours' inside its customer's homes.

Retailer MADE.COM has set up its own social networking site, designed to show off its products in real-life situations.

Visitors to the site - called Unboxed - can search with a 
postcode, by area or for a specific product to see who has purchased what
 in their neighbourhood.

Furniture website MADE.COM has come up with the perfect solution for nosy neighbours - by offering 'virtual tours' inside its customer's homes

Shoppers can also meet face to face to see how homes have been styled and to try out products for themselves.

Chloe Macintosh, MADE.COM Co-Founder and Creative Director, said the idea would show off the products without the need for costly lifestyle 
shoots or high street shops, which ultimately the customer would pay 
for.

She said:  'We tested the 
idea at Salone del Mobile in April, using four of our customer’s Milan 
apartments as exhibition space to showcase our new collections and the 
response was overwhelming.

'People not only want to see products in a 
real life situation, but more than ever we are fascinated by how others 
have decorated their homes; Unboxed taps into this property porn boom.'

The site is already live, having launched with 100 specially selected users, but any MADE customer can participate and upload their home photos.

The company plans to eventually have thousands of showrooms across the country.

One of those taking part in Unboxed is Kate Watson-Smyth, 47, who lives in north London with her husband and two sons

She said: 'We don’t all live in crumbling Venetian Palazzos or huge open plan loft conversions and, as beautiful as those shots might be, sometimes it’s good to have an idea of what that sofa might look like in your own sitting room by looking at other people’s real homes.'
