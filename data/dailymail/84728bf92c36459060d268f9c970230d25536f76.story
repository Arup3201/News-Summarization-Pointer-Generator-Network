A broadcaster has become an internet hit after he stopped two women from kissing him during a live report about the Boston Marathon bomb suspects - and then barely missed a beat as he continued to camera.

Standing in front of floral tributes, Fox
News reporter Mike Tobin was speaking about the timeline of the bombs when two women ran towards him trying to kiss his cheeks.

Mr Tobin was working for the Fox Report 
with Shepard Smith and was mid-way through a report on FBI allegations 
on how the bomb attack that left three people dead was carried out.

As they interrupted him, the reporter held out both arms to push them away.

He said 'Please don't do that' before managing to continue almost seamlessly with the rest of the report.

The reporter, who has covered wars in the Middle East and Pakistan, said the pair were 'inappropriate'.

He later tweeted: 'Heckling comes with the biz. But it's not like they would not no the sbjct. I hope their friends let thm no it wz inappropriate'.

After the interruption, viewers took to Twitter to praise the way Mr Tobin handled the situation.

Grant Friedman wrote: '@MikeTobinFox eyes on the sides of your head. Nice work!'
