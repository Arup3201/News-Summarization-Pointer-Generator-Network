More terrorists could be kicked out of the country if it was not for the Lib Dems, David Cameron suggested this morning.

The Prime Minister said the Government needed to 'restore' Britain's ability to deport extremists, but said it was crucial to overhaul the European Convention of Human Rights to do this. Nick Clegg has blocked any move to curtail the power of the Strasbourg court.

Mr Cameron also revealed he was a 'Thatcherite', attacked Mr Clegg's claim it was unpatriotic to be eurosceptic and suggested Ukip's support would collapse by the time of the next election.

Hate cleric Abu Hamza was deported from Britain in 2012 and is now facing the rest of his life behind bars in the US

David Cameron insisted the UK had a good record tackling extremism after the US convicted Abu Hamza on 11 counts of terrorism. The Islamist spent 10 years in Britain avoiding being kicked out

Mr Cameron's remarks came after he was criticised for relying on the US to convict hate preacher Abu Hamza of 11 terror offences.

The hook-handed Islamist clreic spent 10 years in Britain attacking the West - before finally being deported to American in 2012.

The PM said 'justice has been done' but insisted Britain should not 'talk ourselves down' over the failure to convict him in the UK.

But he admitted there were too many legal hurdles in the way of kicking out terrorrists - and suggested he was being blocked in his bid to cut these back by Nick Clegg. 

Hardline Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has vowed to curtail the European Convention of Human Rights. He wants the final decision to rest with the British Supreme Court in London and not in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg

He said: 'We need to look at the avenues of appeal that there are and make sure that those are gone through more quickly – and we have made changes there.

'Obviously we also need to look, as I’ve said many times, at the European Convention on Human Rights and the position we have got to get into where if someone threatens our country we should be able to deport them if they have no right to be here and that is absolutely essential, that we restore that.

'We’ve taken some big steps, but I plan to take more steps if I’m elected as a Conservative Prime Minister after the next election.' 

In a wide-ranging interview on Radio 4 this morning, ahead of Thursday's European elections, the Prime Minister also claimed he was a 'Thatcherite' and predicted that Ukip supporters would flock back to him in time for the general election.

The Tory leader said he was as committed to people buying their own home as Margaret Thatcher.

Asked if he was a Thatcherite in this regard, Mr Cameron said: 'Absolutely. I think it wasn’t just Margaret Thatcher. Since the Second World War, Conservative leaders have always believed in a property-owning democracy'

David Cameron said the desire to buy your own property was 'natural' and he wanted to help more people get their first home

The PM claimed Labour had tried to extinguish Mrs Thatcher's right to buy - and he wanted to get it going again.

He said: 'I think the introduction of the Right to Buy and those discounts Margaret Thatcher introduced were incredibly important in our country and I’ve tried to relight the Right to Buy fire, as it were.

'I want to see more people buy and own their homes. It is a very natural instinct. I think all of us – I can remember the moment I walked through the door of the first flat that I bought and the pride that you feel and you sense that it’s your own and you can develop and improve it.

'It’s a deep, natural human instinct and I fully support it.'

He claimed that he was putting 'rocket boosters' under Mrs Thatcher's 'Right to Buy' your council house scheme.

The PM added: 'Now, it’s been very challenging in recent years because we had the appalling boom and bust and crash and the banks have been taking time to recover so it’s been difficult for people to get the loans they need, but all of this, like the rest of the economy, is mending and people are now able to get those loans.'

Mr Cameron also appeared to accept that Ukip would siphon off Tory supporters in this week's election. But he insisted they would come back into the Conservative fold in time for the general election - because they would realise that only he could give them an in-out referendum on Europe.

He said: 'In many ways of course the referendum pledge will have its greatest relevance at the time of the next election when people will be choosing: "Do you want to have the Conservatives, David Cameron, continue in office with a long-term economic plan that’s turning the country around and an in/out referendum?"

'Do you want those things or do you want Labour that will tax, spend and borrow?

'Or do you want to vote for another party that could risk not having a long-term economic plan and the referendum?'

Nigel Farage is expected to win this week's European elections - but the Prime Minister this morning claimed many Ukip supporters would vote for the Tories in the next general election because of his promise to hold an in-out referendum in 2017

Mr Cameron also hit back at Nick Clegg’s claims that euroscepticism was 'unpatriotic'.

'You can be deeply patriotic and love your country and believe that its place belongs inside the European Union or you can be deeply patriotic, love your country and believe it belongs outside the European Union,' Mr Cameron said.

He added: 'Your patriotism is not defined by your position on this question; your patriotism is defined by your love of your country, its institutions, its history, what it can do in the world.'
