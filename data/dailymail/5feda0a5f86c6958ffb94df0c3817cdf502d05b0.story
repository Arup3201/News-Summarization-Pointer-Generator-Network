What did the humans enjoy drinking  - and use to get merry - 9,000 years ago?

That’s the question an ‘alcohol archaeologist’ has been attempting to answer, by tracing back some of the world’s most ancient brews.

By analysing the residues found on fragments of pottery and studying references in texts, he has managed to recreate a number of ancient beers and wines that were all but lost to history.

Dr Patrick McGovern from the University of Pennsylvania Museum has been creating ancient alcoholic drinks. He collects residues from containers to recreate the drinks. The oldest he has made so far dates back 9,000 years in China, while another called Midas Touch (shown) is believed to have been drunk by King Midas himself

The beverages were brewed by Dogfish Head Brewery in Delaware, who worked with Dr Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

To reveal what ingredients were needed, Dr McGovern analysed residues found at various archaeological sites around the world.

He detected traces of various ingredients left by the drinks - including barley, honey, herbs and spices - using a number of methods including liquid chromatography, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.

The first drink that he recreated is named the Midas Touch, and is based on molecular evidence from residues found inside a Turkish tomb, believed to have belonged to King Midas, dating back to 700 BC.

A variety of alcoholic residues have been found inside important tombs around the world - suggesting that they were drinks used during celebrations or rituals and perhaps even to wish good luck to the dead in the afterlife.

The sweet and dry Midas Touch beer is made using honey, barley malt, white muscat grapes and saffron.

The oldest beer that Dr McGovern brewed is entitled Chateau Jiahu, the ingredients for which were discovered inside a 9,000-year-old tomb in China.

Midas Touch

Somewhere between beer, wine and mead, this drink is based on molecular evidence found in a Turkish tomb believed to have belonged to King Midas, dating back to 700 BC. It’s a sweet yet dry beer made with honey, barley malt, white muscat grapes and saffron.

Chateau Jiahu

This 9,000-year-old Chinese drink is made with hawthorn fruit, Chinese wild grapes, rice and honey. It is the oldest known fermented beverage in history.

Theobroma

Found in Honduras, Theobrama is brewed with artisanal dark chocolate from the ancient cacao area of Soconusco, honey, chilies, corn and annatto or achiote (fragrant and reddish, imitating sacrificial blood). It dates back 3,400 years, based on chemical analysis of pottery fragments found in Honduras which contained the earliest chocolate beverage from the Americas..

Ta Henket

The ingredients of this drink are based on chemical and botanical analyses of Egypt's oldest known wine (about 3150 BC) and other sites dating back 18,000 years, in addition to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions and artistic depictions of brewing. It uses an ancient species of wheat (einkorn) for hearth-baked bread, with added chamomile, doum palm fruit and Middle Eastern herbs.

Birra Etrusca Bronze

This 2,800-year-old drink uses two-row malted barley and an heirloom Italian wheat. It heralds from Italy and also contains speciality ingredients such as hazelnuts, pomegranates, Italian chestnut honey and wildflower and clover honeys from Delaware, and myrrh. The Dogfish version was brewed with bronze (replicating the ancient vessels made of this metal alloy); the Italian versions were brewed in replica Etruscan pottery jars and oak barrels. 

Kvasir

Chemical, botanical and pollen evidence are the basis for this 'Nordic grog,' which is attested at sites in Sweden and Denmark from the Bronze Age to Roman times. The contents of a 3,500-year-old Danish drinking vessel exemplifies this drink. The vessel was made of birch bark and found in the tomb of a leather and woollen-clad woman, who was possibly a priestess. The ingredients are sourced from the far north: red winter wheat, lingonberries, cranberries, bog myrtle (Myrica gale), yarrow, honey, juniper, and birch syrup. Imported wine from southern and central Europe was also added to the bracing northern brew. 

It is made using hawthorn fruit, Chinese wild grapes, rice and honey, and is the oldest known fermented beverage in history - older even than wine.

While most simply involve the mixing of ingredients for fermentation, others required slightly more bizarre production methods.

For example, to make Chateau Jiahu, corn must be milled and moistened in the maker’s mouth to convert starches in the corn into fermentable sugars - before it is ‘spat’ into the beer.

‘All the drinks are centred around natural products of the regions,’ Dr McGovern told MailOnline.

‘These drinks represent speciality upper class beverages, used in kinds of ceremonies, religious rites festivals.

'But in some places and periods, such as the more democratised Neolithic, the general populace seem to have enjoyed them, too.'

The oldest drink made by Dr McGovern and Dogfish is Chateau Jiahu (shown), the ingredients for which were found in a 9,000-year-old tomb in China. It is made from hawthorn fruit, Chinese wild grapes, rice and honey, and is the oldest known fermented beverage in history - older even than wine

Dr McGovern likens them to expensive cocktails today.

In particular, in northern Europe it was not possible to make wine, so it had to be imported from central or southern Europe, making it an expensive beverage.

‘You had a great deal of social elite value to it,’ he said. ‘Just like today, you serve a fancy bottle of wine, but only certain [people] can afford it to impress the neighbours, it was the same thing in antiquity.’

With regards to finding the recipes to make the drinks, Dr McGovern has scoured texts to find out the various ingredients.

But he also gathers residues from certain ancient containers.

‘Sometimes I’m just fortunate [in finding them], sometimes it took me on a grand tour,’ he said.

The residues aren’t always visible, though; most get absorbed into pottery, and must be extracted in a complicated process using solvents.

The drink called Ta Henket relied on ingredients from Egyptian hieroglyphics. It uses an ancient species of wheat for hearth-baked bread, with added chamomile, doum palm fruit (shown) and Middle Eastern herbs

Pictured is an ancient Roman imported drinking-set, comprised of a bucket (situla), a ladle and strainer-cup nested together, and several 'sauce pans' or drinking cups, from a hoard under the floor of a settlement at Havor, Sweden in the southern part of the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea, from the first century AD

A young blond woman, believed to be a priestess, was buried in an oak trunk coffin under a mound at Egtved in Jutland, Denmark between 1500 and 1300 BC. She was found with the birch-bark bucket pictured earlier. Wrapped in a cow hide, she wears a dancer’s tasseled dress with a large bronze bronze disk

A 30-year-old woman was laid to rest in a wood coffin at Juellinge, Denmark around 200 BC, shown. Together with cosmetic items and jewelry, the woman held a long-handled bronze strainer-cup in her right hand, part of an imported Roman wine-set, including a bucket, ladle and incised glass beaker behind her head

Dr McGovern said his favourite is Chateau Jiahu, the oldest of the lot he has made, dating back 9,000 years.

‘That’s the one that I identify with most,’ he said. 'It goes well with Asian food, it has a sweet and sour profile.'

Based on botanical evidence, Dr McGovern believes there may be an even older Egyptian drink from 16,000 BC that could be made, and that it is likely humans have been making alcoholic drinks for much, much longer.

‘All animals are attracted to sugar and alcohol: insects, fruit fly, elephants,’ he said. ‘Humans would have known how to make an alcoholic beverage right from the beginning.’
