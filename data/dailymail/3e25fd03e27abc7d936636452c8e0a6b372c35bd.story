Fresh accusations are flying at two arms of Rupert Murdoch's media empire as the British Parliament accuses the media mogul of offering big bucks to U.S. soldiers in exchange for a photo of ousted Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in his underwear.

The new accusations came during a new debate over reforms suggested by the Leveson Inquiry, and how Murdoch's News Corp got their hands on the photo, taken in an Iraqi prison, that showed the dictator in nothing but his skivvies.

The image was splashed across the covers of News Corp publications The Sun and the New York Post in May 2005.

Humiliation: The photo was published in May 2005 editions of the New York Post and The Sun

The Sun headline read, 'The Tyrant's in His Pants' while the Post went with 'Butcher of Saghdad.'

Now, British lawmakers are charging that Murdoch and other News Corp senior officials are snubbing authorities as they investigate allegations of phone hacking against the firm.

'I urge the [News Corp. Management and Standards Committee] to provide all the emails from Rupert and [his son] James Murdoch to News International staff as a matter of urgency... in particular to the photo of Saddam,' Labour Party MP Chris Bryant told the UK's Parliament. He added it was 'difficult to see' how editors and the reporters involved 'could possibly pretend that they did not know' they obtained the photograph.

He demanded answers 'otherwise, people will conclude in this country that News International is still refusing to cooperate with the police.'

President George W. Bush had ordered an investigation into how The Sun and the Post obtained the photos, but never found the source of the leak.

The Sun’s former managing editor Graham Dudman said at the time that his newspaper paid ‘more than £500 (about $800)' for the photos, but Bryant he had information from 'two well-placed people inside News International' that the newspapers paid 'a substantial sum' to a serving member of the US armed forces. 

He added that 'a much larger amount was then paid via a specially set up account in the United Kingdom' to the same source. Some reports put the figure at $100,000.

Probe coming? Rupert Murdoch’s (right) media firm News Corp could be investigated over claims it obtained photos of the late Saddam Hussein (left) wearing only his underpants in an Iraq jail by bribing a U.S. official

Comment: The Sun's former managing editor Graham Dudman said at the time his newspaper paid 'more than £500' for the photos, but the Daily Beast had now claimed the 'payment was significantly greater'

Mr Dudman 
said at the time that US military sources handed over the photos to deal
 ‘a body blow to the resistance in Iraq’ and that the picture was 
obtained by ‘professional journalistic methods’.

The Daily
 
Telegraph has claimed a Sun photographer was sent to California to buy 
the pictures.

US military officials believe the photos were taken at the Camp Cropper 
prison near Baghdad at a time from January to April 2004, before Hussein
 was due to be tried for crimes against humanity.

Unsuccessful probe: Former US president George W. Bush ordered an investigation into how the Sun and New York Post newspapers obtained the photos, published in May 2005, but never found the source of the leak

Unhappy: News Corp reacted angrily to the new allegations of bribery put forward by the Daily Beast, claiming it was 'just a lame attempt to regurgitate old news' and 'all of this was widely reported on in 2005'

A spokesman for News Corp said: ‘We didn’t believe then, and certainly don’t believe now, that it
 was wrong to acquire and publish newsworthy photographs of a notorious 
war criminal.’

More than 50 people have been arrested by the Metropolian Police as they investigate alleged payments to public officials in Operation Elveden, but detectives involved with the inquiry are not thought to be probing the Hussein photo.

One of those arrested in the probe was Mr Dudman - although he has not been charged with any criminal offence in Britain.

Operation Elveden - the investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials and other information leaks - is being run alongside two other operations looking at allegations of phone hacking and accusations of computer hacking.

News Corp is already being probed in the US by the FBI and other American agencies over whether it committed any crimes under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing public officials in Britain.

The Act means US-owned companies which are proven to have bribed public officials can be fined and senior executives sent to jail. Hussein was executed 18 months after the pictures were published.
