A lifelong smoker keen to quit has taken drastic measures to kick the habit - he has locked his head in a cage which prevents him from putting a cigarette in his mouth.

Ibrahim Yücel is so unsure of his own willpower that he entrusts the keys to the bizarre contraption to his family so he is not tempted to release himself.

The Turkish man was inspired by another successful health campaign - the safety helmets worn by motorbike riders.

Desperate measures: Ibrahim Yücel wears a cage over his head in a bid to stop himself from smoking

Mr Yücel, 42, has been smoking two packets of cigarettes a day since the age of 16, according to Hürriyet.

However, since his father died of lung cancer, he has been desperate to quit for the good of his health and his family.

He has made several attempts to give up, but has always returned to the habit despite his efforts. 

Fitting: Mr Yücel's daughter attaches the cage to her father's head as she goes out to work

Outlandish: The 42-year-old was inspired by the designed of motorbike safety helmets

So Mr Yücel, from the western 
province of Kütahya, designed the helmet, similar to a birdcage, which 
prevents him from smoking a cigarette at all.

Every morning he heads off to work wearing the elaborate device - and he takes extra measures to stop himself from opening it and sneaking a smoke.

He leaves the keys to the cage with his wife and his children, meaning there is no way he can break his vow to himself.

Out and about: Mr Yücel has attracted more than his fair share of funny looks from neighbours

The family was initially dubious about his slightly ridiculous get-up, but after a few days they realised that the plan might just be the thing to help him give up at last.

However, not all Mr Yücel's neighbours have got used to the sight of his head encased in metal.

Video footage shows him walking around his local area followed by young children, entranced by the unusual spectacle.
