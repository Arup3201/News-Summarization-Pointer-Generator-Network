British metal band, The Defiled, has just made history.

They are the first-ever band to play a live gig atop a gigantic iceberg - located in the middle of the Greenland Sea.

The Defiled performed on top of a floating platform for the Jägermeister Ice Cold Gig – which sees artists put to the test as they perform in unconventional, ice-cold conditions.

And between the freezing temperatures and fast flowing ice, the rock stars did just that.

The small crowd, mostly from the nearby town of Kulusuk, ventured to the ice field to watch this once-in-a-lifetime gig from fishing boats. 

To reach their iceberg stage, the band first flew to Iceland, before transferring to Kulusuk, Greenland, and then heading by boat to the small island of Tasiilaq, which has a population of just over 2000.

It actually took several days of searching to find the 'perfect' berg - one that was large and thick enough to hold the band and all of their equipment.

Locals, who have lived and worked on the icebergs for years, helped the band to shuttle their instruments and sound equipment to the gig stage, and to thank them for their help, the group donated their equipment to the local community hall after the gig. 

Band member Stitch D said: 'This has to be one of the most insane gigs we've ever played! You see these things on TV documentaries but it's not until you get to see them in real life that you realise just how big and amazing icebergs are.

'Although it was cold, I don't think any of us noticed once we got started. The stage location literally takes your breath away.' 

To capture the footage, state-of-the-art flying drone cameras were used and controlled by nearby boats

Known for their dark and imposing on-stage outfits - which provided an incredible contrast to the all-white surroundings - The Defiled played a 30 minute set in total, featuring tracks from their latest album Daggers.

To capture the footage, Jägermeister and the band utilised state-of-the-art 'octocopter flying drone cameras,' controlled remotely by the boats nearby, which hovered above the iceberg. 

Tom Carson, Jägermeister music manager, added: 'As far as stage backdrops go, I don’t think you’ll find anything more impressive than this.'
