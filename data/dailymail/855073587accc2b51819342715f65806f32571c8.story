Boris Johnson earned just under £900,000 in freelance earnings on top of his salary as London’s Mayor during his first three years in office, it emerged yesterday.

He earned £363,000 from freelance work in the first year after he was elected  in 2008.

Over the four years to April 2011 he earned £1.7million, including his mayoral salary for the last three years of that period.

'Liar': Mr Johnson, right, has accused Mr Livingstone of concealing the fact he avoided tax by channelling media earnings through a private company

In the last 12 months Mr Johnson earned an extra £339,625 – paying £214,000 in tax – on top of his £143,911 salary.

The Conservative Mayor earns £250,000 a year from a column in a national newspaper.

A Labour source asked: ‘How can a mayor have a second job? Even David Cameron said his Cabinet ministers should not have outside interests.’

The figures were revealed as Ken Livingstone was accused of paying a lower rate of income tax than a cleaner at London’s City Hall after he refused to release full details of his tax affairs.

Labour’s candidate for Mayor had joined his main rivals on Wednesday in promising to publish his entire personal tax details. But although he published some figures yesterday, Mr Livingstone said he would give full details only if other candidates agreed to disclose information concerning their spouses and partners.

Mr Livingstone, who is fighting to win back the job he lost to Mr Johnson in 2008, has come under fire for channelling earnings through a company so that they are liable for corporation rather than income tax.

Open book: Lib Dem candidate Brian Paddick joined Mr Johnson in revealing his income, while Mr Livingstone initially refused

During a radio debate earlier this week a furious Mr Johnson accused Mr Livingstone of telling the ‘bare-faced’ lie that he has also avoided tax by channelling his media earnings through a private company.

When they later came face to face in a lift Mr Johnson reportedly called him a ‘f****** liar.

On BBC2’s Newsnight on Wednesday he refused to apologise, while Mr Livingstone said all candidates should be prepared to set out their earnings over a four-year period. He said: ‘I’m happy to publish details of everything I’ve earned in the last four years. Are you going to do the same? – and was met with an immediate ‘yes’ from Mr Johnson.

While Mr Johnson and Lib Dem candidate Brian Paddick published their tax details yesterday morning, Mr Livingstone initially refused.

He then published partial details which included the tax he pays in a personal capacity, but not that paid through his private company Silveta Ltd.

The partial information, which was not signed off by an accountant, showed that in 2010/11 he paid £22,691 in income tax and £11,970 in corporation tax.

Mr Livingstone said that was an effective tax rate of 35 per cent on ‘total income’ of £94,568 in that year.

But Matthew Hancock, a Tory MP and former adviser to George Osborne, said the effective income tax rate was in fact 14.5 per cent, if the total amount of income channelled through Silveta – more than £200,000 – is taken into account.

He said: ‘By funnelling his earnings in this way, Mr Livingstone has been paying tax at just 14.5 per cent – lower than a City Hall cleaner.’

Brian Paddick, whose income is mainly a £63,000 police pension, earned £334,146 in three years to April 2011 and paid £100,693 in income tax.
