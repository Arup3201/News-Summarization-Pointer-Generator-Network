A grandmother who was prematurely declared dead later awoke in a hospital's freezer and desperately struggled to get out before eventually freezing to death, according to court documents.

The family of Maria de Jesus Arroyo, 80, can go forward with a lawsuit against the California hospital that prematurely declared her dead in July 2010, an appeals court ruled on Wednesday.

The California 2nd District Court of 
Appeal overturned a lower court ruling that the lawsuit against Boyle Heights' White 
Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles was filed too late.

The appeals court ruled that the family had no way of knowing Arroyo, a married mother-of-eight, had later awoken and died in the freezer before a pathologist revealed his findings in 2011.

Mrs Arroyo, who had just celebrated her 80th birthday with relatives, suffered a heart attack on July 26, 2010 and was declared dead by staff at White Memorial, where she was placed in a freezer.

Morticians who received her body a few days later discovered that it was face down and that she had a broken nose and disfiguring cuts and bruises to her face, court papers said.

The injuries to her face were so bad that they could not be covered with makeup, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Arroyo's family filed a lawsuit that claimed her body was mishandled soon after.

At a hearing in December 2011, a pathologist said she had been 'frozen alive', 'eventually woke up' and caused the injuries herself as she tried to escape the 'frozen tomb,' court records said.

The family withdrew the lawsuit and in May 2012 filed a medical-malpractice lawsuit, claiming the hospital mistakenly declared her dead and froze her while she was still alive.

A judge in Los Angeles County Superior Court threw out the lawsuit, ruling that it was filed past the one-year statute of limitations after her injuries were discovered.

But the appellate court said the family had 'absolutely no reason' to suspect that the woman was alive until the pathologist gave his expert opinion. The case will now return to the lower court.

The hospital has not addressed the allegation that Arroyo was prematurely declared dead, the Times said, citing court records.

A hospital representative has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Mrs Arroyo left behind eight children and her husband, with whom she had been for 63 years.
