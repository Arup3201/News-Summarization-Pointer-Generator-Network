Hospital patients should avoid undergoing surgery at the weekend if they want the best chance of surviving, a global study has revealed.

Researchers from Tohoku University, Japan, using statistics of more than 55million patients, found that patients are 17 per cent more likely to die on a Saturday afternoon because of the 'weekend effect'.

A different publication presented at this year's Euroanaesthesia congress in Stockholm added that the highest risk of death following surgery came if it was performed during the afternoon or in February.

Shocking: A global study has revealed that patients are 17 per cent more likely to die if admitted to hospital at the weekend

In
 this study, the researchers investigated the daily, weekly, and 
seasonal variability of hospital mortality in patients after surgery.

A
 retrospective analysis was carried out on patients who underwent surgery 
between 2006 and 2011 at the two University Hospital Campuses of Charité
 Tertiary Care University Center, Berlin.

In 
this first analysis of the data, a total of 218,758 patients were 
included. Hospital mortality showed variability over the course of the 
day, during different weekdays, and different months.

Surgery conducted 
in the afternoon was associated with 21 per cent increased risk of death 
compared with surgery conducted at other times of day.

Surgery at the 
weekend was associated with a 22 per cent increased risk of death 
compared with surgery on weekdays.

February was the highest risk month 
for surgery, with surgery in February associated with a 16 per cent 
increased risk of death compared with surgery in all other months.

Further work on the data will be carried out in the coming months, 
including looking at the possible reasons behind the variations.

The
 authors say: 'Several factors may have influenced this outcome.

'For 
example, it may be that standard of care differs throughout the day and 
between weekdays and weekends.

'Although we controlled for risk factors 
including emergency surgery in our study, it may very well be that the 
patients treated in the afternoon and on the weekends were more severely
 ill.

'We need more data to draw conclusions regarding seasonal variation
 in postoperative outcome.'

They
 add: 'Despite having an accredited quality management system in place 
in our hospitals, as well as having the European Society of 
Anaesthesiology's Helsinki Declaration of Patient Safety in 
Anaesthesiology implemented, this study shows that we should seek to 
further improve patient safety.'

Concern: Scientists from Imperial College, London, said the statistics proved there was a growing global healthcare problem

In Britain patients are 
usually left under the care of junior doctors at the weekends who may only have a few 
months’ experience with one or two consultants ‘on-call’ answering their
 mobile phones from home.

Dr Paul Aylin from Imperial College said the studies showed 'powerful' evidence of a global problem in healthcare.

He told the Independent:
 'Both studies acknowledge the differences could reflect poorer care or 
simply that patients admitted at these times were more severely ill.

'More
 research is needed to find out exactly what contributes to higher 
mortality at weekends. Is it lack of clinical staff, nursing staff, 
diagnostic services, other hospital resources?'

Last October, the NHS confirmed it was moving to a seven-day operation, despite months of opposition.

The British Medical Association also agreed the 
quality of care provided in hospitals at the weekend needs to be 
improved.

Only a fifth of hospitals have specialist palliative care staff on duty on Saturdays and Sundays according to experts, despite official guidance demanding seven-day care ten years ago.

Around three-quarters offer face-to-face
 palliative care on weekdays only. However, the report found one in four
 fail to provide a decent quality of service at any time.

In December, the NHS's Medical Director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said he planned to 
impose fines of around £12million on hospitals where patients experience
 poor care at the weekends,
