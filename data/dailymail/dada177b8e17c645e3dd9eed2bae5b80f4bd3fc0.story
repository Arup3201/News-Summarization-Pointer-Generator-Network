A businessman jailed for fraud after being 'swallowed' by his addiction to online gambling has written a repentant letter to his family revealing the double life he kept from them for 30 years.

David Bradford, 58, of Waterthorpe, Sheffield, was jailed for two years in April after swindling a Welsh company out of more than £50,000 to repay private bank loans and secret gambling debts.

His wife Denise and three children had no idea he was in trouble until his sentencing - and the father recently decided to come clean to them, telling them about the 'money bug' that wrecked their family.

In a repentant letter from behind bars, the former chair of governors at a children's school, who was paid £71,000 a year in his role for a healthcare supplies company, said he was 'stung by the power of money'.

He said a love of money led to a mountain of debt which sparked his pursuit of a quick 'win'.

Bradford has appealed to anyone falling into a similar situation to seek help and support at the first sign of trouble.

In the letter, he writes: 'This is my truth. I am a fraudster. I am a gambler, maybe a compulsive gambler.

'I discovered money talked and those dreams on the horizon could be brought closer. The 'money bug' was a disease idolised by all.

'I became a keen follower. I did not have to look far to find a bank or organisation that would lend me money and it seemed this was the way one bettered oneself.

Warning: Adam Bradford, (above) who received a letter from his father from prison, has warned people about the dangers of online gambling and has started a campaign calling for tighter regulations on the industry 

'I was swallowed down this tunnel to a point where I could only borrow money to finance the repayments of earlier borrowing, a self-perpetuating and self-defeating spiral of debt. 

'I never shared the state of my debt ridden life - not with my family, not even with myself.

'This part of my life has an unknown beginning buried by me in my mind under lock and key. 

'Along this journey of deceit I took to gambling - firstly as a way of making a quick win to kill this mountain of debt and then, as it failed to live up to those expectations, it became an escape with potential to cure my money ailments.

'The atmosphere of my life was turning very sour and yet I still was not brave enough to openly admit the absolutely devastating money mess I was burying myself in.

'But the atmosphere can be sourer, more putrid and in my dark side this was the natural course to take - fraud!'

Mr Bradford said he gambled 'like it was an Olympic sport'.

'This is my truth. I am a fraudster. I am a gambler, maybe a compulsive gambler.

'I discovered money talked and those dreams on the horizon could be brought closer. 'The 'money bug' was a disease idolised by all.

'I became a keen follower. I did not have to look far to find a bank or organisation that would lend me money and it seemed this was the way one bettered oneself.

 'I was swallowed down this tunnel to a point where I could only borrow money to finance the repayments of earlier borrowing, a self-perpetuating and self-defeating spiral of debt. 

'I never shared the state of my debt ridden life - not with my family, not even with myself.

'This part of my life has an unknown beginning buried by me in my mind under lock and key.

'Along this journey of deceit I took to gambling - firstly as a way of making a quick win to kill this mountain of debt and then, as it failed to live up to those expectations, it became an escape with potential to cure my money ailments.' 

Now, the Bradford family face losing their home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and say their lives have been left in turmoil by the revelations.

He added: 'Now my family do not trust me and all my good points count for nothing. My friends have retreated and are ashamed even to call me an acquaintance. 

'My colleagues, my MP and most who know me have put a big distance between me and them. I would do the same if I was them.

'My sentence extends to a family distraught, a family set to lose everything now. My friends' views of me are tainted and I am damaged forever. 

'If anyone sees a little piece of themselves in my story may I offer them this advice - never lie. Seek help and support at the first sign of trouble.' 

His son Adam, 21, claimed after the sentencing that he 'was in absolute disbelief and disgust' at his father's actions.

The young businessman has now launched a campaign calling for tighter regulations and control of the online gambling industry to protect those suffering from compulsive behaviours. 

He said: 'We will lose everything we've got. Our house is on the line, our life is in turmoil and my father is similarly suffering from psychological problems. 

'Life will never be the same for us and my dad's letter shows for the first time how dangerous compulsive behaviour can be, made ever worse by the availability of money and gambling in the modern world. 

'I hope my father's story and honesty helps others to know this situation is not as rare as it sounds, help and support is available. Do not be afraid to reach out and access it.'

Apologetic: The fraudster sent four pages of scrawling writing to his family, in which he came clean about the double life that he had kept from them for 30 years

Confession: In the heartfelt letter Bradford writes 'I was swallowed down this tunnel to a point where I could only borrow money to finance the repayments'
