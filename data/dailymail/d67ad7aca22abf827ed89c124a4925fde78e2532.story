A retired NHS manager came within inches of death after a bullet was fired at him during a struggle with a gunman at a luxury holiday hotel.

Peter Norledge, 70, and his wife Christine were staying at Cape Town's Waterfront Victoria Junction as part of a 48-strong British tour group.

The couple were enjoying a late night cup of tea just before retiring to bed when a man knocked on their door claiming he was there to check a problem with the ventilation.

Recovery: British tourist Peter Norledge, 70, was left inches from death after battling a hotel room intruder who beat him around the head with the gun barrel

Brave: The armed robber had tricked his way into Mr Norledge's luxury hotel room in Cape Town, South Africa, where he had been staying with wife Christine

Recalling the struggle from his hospital bed, Mr Norledge, from Derby, said: 'It sounded like housekeeper who had just delivered us some milk for our tea.

'I thought he had come back for some reason. But it was a different bloke who said he had come to check the ventilation. I let him in and the next thing I knew I was looking down the barrel of a gun.

'He instructed my wife and I to lie face down on the bed but I refused. He then pushed me and demanded money. I opened the room safe and he grabbed two bags of jewellery I had just purchased.

'I wasn't prepared to let him take them so I tried to hold on to his wrist and he then grabbed my wallet. I then tried to grab that back from him and that's when we started fighting.

'I was afraid but I also didn't want him to get away with it. But he got the upper hand when he started to hit me with the barrel of his gun. Blows rained down and I covered my head with my hands.

'Then a shot went off. I don't know if it was accidental or if he fired it to scare us. The bullet hit the ceiling and ricocheted onto the floor where it was later found by police.

'While the robber was hitting me I heard Christine screaming at him to stop hurting me. I think her screaming frightened him off.'

Christine, 60, who had been screaming at the robber during the attack, called reception for help. It was only then that the gunman fled.

Drenched from head to waist in blood, Mr Norledge was later rushed to a Cape Town hospital where he underwent two hours of neurosurgery to repair a depressed fracture of his skull.

He also received sutures to a number of lacerations on his face.

The brave pensioner is still recovering in hospital and will only be discharged in the next few days.

He was attacked at around 8pm on Friday. The couple had been due to leave South Africa with the rest of the tour group on Monday but will only return to the UK once he is fully recovered.

Mr Norledge says although he was scared during the ordeal he only started to fear for his life when the shot was fired. 'That's when I thought he might kill us.'

But despite a dream holiday spoilt at the very end, he has no regrets about standing up to the robber. 'What do you do otherwise? Stand there meekly and hand everything over?'

Meanwhile Cape Town detectives are still searching for the suspect who is in his mid thirties. He stole Norledge's wallet containing about 400 South African rand (about 25 sterling) and Â£300.

Police have compiled an identikit of the suspect and have obtained hotel CCTV footage of him knocking on doors on the fifth floor before he proceeded to the fourth floor.

Security at the hotel has been stepped up since the attack.
