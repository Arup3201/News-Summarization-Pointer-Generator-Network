Queen's Park Rangers have failed to tempt midfielder Yann M'Vila away from Inter Milan. 

The France international has been deemed surplus to requirements under new manager Roberto Mancini and is keen to move.

Adel Taarabt was mentioned in discussions over a possible deal for M'Vila but the 24-year-old was not interested.

M'Vila has played 22 times for France but hasn't featured for them since 2012 after he was banned from the national team for two years for disciplinary issues, later reduced to just under 18 months

The former Rennes midfielder has made 11 appearances for Inter this season, but has only started one Serie A match since Mancini returned to the club in November.

Manager Harry Redknapp is looking to bolster his midfield options after summer signing Sandro has struggled with injury for much of the season.

QPR did complete the loan signing of Mauro Zarate on Tuesday but M'Vila will not be joining the Argentine at Loftus Road in January.
