For any homegrown tennis fan, watching Andy Murray battle his way through Wimbledon is a test of nerves - and the Duchess of Cambridge is no exception.

The 30-year-old yesterday struggled to maintain her royal composure as she cheered on Murray during his quarter-final clash with Spain's David Ferrer.

Sitting alongside her husband Prince William in the Royal Box on Centre Court amid a galaxy of tennis heavyweights, Kate looked to be thoroughly enjoying herself.

Although they watched much of the match, the couple were not there to see Murray's victory.

They had earlier watched as six-time champion Roger Federer beat Russian Mikhail Youzhny 
before seeing Murray.

They may have had to leave early as 
William will tomorrow be installed as Knight of the Thistle - the 
highest honour in Scotland - at a special service in Edinburgh with the 
Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Royal and his wife.

Kate
 recycled an outfit she wore on the couple's tour of Canada exactly a 
year ago, donning a knitted sailor dress by Alexander 
McQueen, teaming it with navy blue heels and a Jaeger clutch bag.

The couple sat on the front row of the Royal Box with All England club chairman Philip Brook and his wife Gill.

Their
 visit completes a family set - on Tuesday Kate's parents, Carole and 
Michael Middleton, were invited into the box. Last week, Mrs Middleton 
watched on Centre Court, but from the normal seats.

But the following day Kate's siblings Pippa and James enjoyed seats in the Royal Box when they put in an appearance at SW19.

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall visited last week, on Charles's first visit to the championship since 1970.

William and Kate were yesterday joined in the prime seats by famous faces 
including tennis couple Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf, television sports 
presenter Des Lynam, veteran broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson and 
England football manager Roy Hodgson.

Murray
 was also watched by his usual support team including girlfriend Kim 
Sears - spotted biting her nails during the tense match - and mother 
Judy Murray.

He roared to victory over Ferrer and booked himself a place in the semi-finals after a nail-biting tie-break.

He will now take on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in tomorrow's semi-final.

The
 British number one was given a reprieve from the rain, playing in dry 
weather apart from one brief delay, clinching victory with an ace.

He did his now-trademark 'fingers to the sky' gesture as fans celebrated the win.

In
 his post-match press conference, the 25-year-old said playing 'tough 
opponent' Tsonga would be a challenge, but he was 'trying my best to win
 the tournament for myself obviously, but also for everybody else'.

Asked
 about playing in front of William and Kate, he said: 'Obviously I was 
aware of it. We got told this morning before we went on the court, and 
obviously when I saw Roger playing I saw them sitting in the Royal Box.

'I think it's always going to make a difference when you have royalty in there.

'For
 me, also playing in front of someone like Agassi as well and Steffi 
Graf. Rod Laver was there, too. You know, it was an unbelievable 
privilege to play in front of those people.'

Earlier, six-time champion Federer revealed he met William and Kate.

He
 said: 'They were very nice, very friendly. We had a bit of a chat. What
 exactly, it's not so important I don't think. But it was a nice 
conversation.

'Royals 
coming out, I think it's inspiring, too, in some ways, believe it or 
not. It's great for the event. It's great for Wimbledon. It's great for 
the club. It's great for the players.'

Murray's latest victory is guaranteed to send 'Murray mania' into overdrive.

Monica Przygoda, 20, from London, said: 'It's exciting that he's through to the semi-final.'

Mary
 and Trevor Astell, who travelled from Liverpool with son Tom, met up 
with daughter Roisin who is working at the championships.

Mrs
 Astell, 52, said: 'It was fantastic. It was looking a bit uncertain at 
times, and we knew it would be tough, but it's so great that he's 
through.'

And the victory 
boosted Murray's odds with the bookies, with William Hill putting him at
 1/2 to beat Tsonga - the shortest odds for a Briton to make the final 
since 1938 - and 9/2 to win the grand slam.

Spokesman
 Rupert Adams said: 'Murray has the best of the semi-finals and the odds
 suggest we will have a British player in the final.'
