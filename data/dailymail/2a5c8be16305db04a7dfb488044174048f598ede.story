Michael Strahan has confirmed that he has been in talks with Good Morning America about joining the morning show team in addition to his co-hosting role on 'Live with Kelly and Michael'.

The former football star-turned-chat show host reiterated that he will keep the 9am talk show as his priority even though he is going to be brought into the GMA fold after the sudden departure of Josh Elliott.

'This is what I do. This is me. This is my home. I love you,' he said on 'Live' to Kelly Ripa.

New prospects: Michael Strahan confirmed on Wednesday that he has been in talks with executives at Good Morning America about joining the program in addition to his work on 'Live with Kelly and Michael'

What's to come: Strahan said that they had not yet figured out the details but reassured fans that the 9am talk show and Ripa were his 'number one' priorities

'So no matter what I go nowhere. This is my love. You are my love. This is my job so don't worry.'

Strahan said that he had gone for meetings with GMA executives but they had not yet finalized how he would juggle his work on the two shows- both of which air on ABC and are Disney productions. 

Strahan, who played for the New York Giants for 15 years, already pulls double duty during football season as he works as a commentator for Fox NFL Sunday.

He said that whatever they work out with GMA, they will have to be 'smart about it' when it comes to his schedule.

'This is my number one priority, you are my number one priority and I love what I do. I would never do anything to jeopardize the quality of what we do,' he said on 'Live'.   

Coinicidence? On Sunday it was announced that GMA's news anchor Josh Elliott (right) would be leaving the show for rival NBC. But sources say Strahan (left) won't be replacing any one person on the show

Welcome to the desk! Strahan will appear on a 
few segments a week before shuttling a mile north to film his other 
show. Above, the GMA cast as of St Patrick's Day. Josh Elliott (second

ABC News executives 
have reportedly been in talks with Strahan for months, and his impending
 hiring is not to replace any individual on the show. 

News of Strahan joining the show comes just as GMA's news anchor Josh Elliott announced he was leaving to join rival NBC.

NBC has scheduled a press conference for Wednesday afternoon where they will presumably announce Elliott's new role.

Elliott has been replaced as news anchor on GMA by Amy Robach.

If hired, Strahan will add a much needed male-perspective to the show since George Stephanopoulos is the only remaining man on the desk.
