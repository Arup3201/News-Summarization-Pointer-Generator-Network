Former Liverpool midfielder Vladimir Smicer is a candidate in the European elections - on a platform of fighting child obesity.

Smicer, who won the Champions League during his six-year spell at Anfield, is standing for Czech party Vize 2014 (Vision 2014).

However the ex-footballer, who scored in Liverpool's famous Champions League final comeback in Istanbul, says he doesn't expect, or even want, to become an MEP.

Comeback: Smicer scored the second of Liverpool's three second half goals in Istanbul.

Champion: Smicer's had a mixed six seasons at Anfield, but he was crucial to their Champions League triumph

He told his party's website: 'It's not my ambition to be an MEP.

'In the Czech Republic obesity rates among children have quadrupled in the last 15 years. More than half of the adult population of the EU are overweight or obese. Amongst children it's one in seven. I see it in the kids around me. Fitness isn't 'in'.

'We've got to get our kids away from their computers, tablets and smartphones and get them moving. This is something Europe needs to care about.'

National legend: Smicer won 81 caps for the Czech Republic during a distinguished playing career

Ambitions: Since retiring from playing, Smicer has worked for the Czech FA before turning to politics

However, the ex-footballer is not thought to have much of a chance of winning in the elections. Vision 2014 is a fringe party with little prospect of success.

Smicer spent six years at Liverpool between 1999 and 2006 before finishing his career with Slavia Prague in 2009.

He has worked for the Czech FA since his retirement, but recently left his role with the national team.
