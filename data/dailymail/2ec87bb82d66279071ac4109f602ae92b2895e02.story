George Osborne's budget has led experts to question the definition of bread

George Osborne's budget has left the taxman scratching his head after it prompted HM Revenue and Customs to launch a public consultation to discover the exact definition of bread. 

Last week the chancellor announced VAT of 20 per cent will be extended to all hot takeaway foods such as pasties and pies which are ‘above the ambient air temperature at the time they are provided to the customer’. 

However, as bread is considered a basic food, it is not subject to VAT whether it is warmed in the oven or served cold. 

But bakers have pointed out there is no exact definition of bread. 

For example, is a croissant considered a type of bread? Or a hot-cross bun? 

To find out, the government has launched a consultation which has even left retail experts puzzled. 

According to the consultation document: 'For a number of years, the borderline between hot takeaway food (standard-rated) and cold takeaway food (zero-rated) has been the subject of litigation, with some retailers arguing that the purpose of heating their food products is to improve their appearance or to comply with health and safety regulations, rather than to enable them to be consumed hot.

'So, although many retailers and takeaway outlets charge VAT on the sale of hot chicken products, hot pies and toasted sandwiches, some retailers and bakery chains sell similar products zero-rated.'

Use your loaf: Bread is deemed a basic food and therefore not subject to VAT

Bakeries including Subway and Ainsleys 
of Leeds have in the past appealed against charges on hot food because 
they believe the products were not necessarily designed to be eaten hot.

High street baker Greggs has already threatened to take legal action if HMRC tries to label its food as 'hot' and subject to VAT.

A spokesman told the magazine, British Baker: 'We do not believe that our freshly baked savoury products should be subject to VAT and we will be making strong representation to the Government regarding the proposed changes.'

But Mr Osborne said the extension was among a number that were necessary to end anomalies.

Confusion: Should croissants, scones and hot-cross buns be subject to VAT?

His decision will raise an extra £125million this year and £350million a year by 2016.

But it means 18p will be added to the price of a 90p hot sausage roll and 30p to a £1.49 pasty.

Greggs reported profits of more than £50million in both 2010 and 2011. 

The results were due in part to a rapid expansion that has seen the bakery chain increase its number of stores. It now boasts nearly 1,500 outlets in the UK – more than McDonalds.

In 2009, a study found that annual sales of pies nationwide had reached £941million.
