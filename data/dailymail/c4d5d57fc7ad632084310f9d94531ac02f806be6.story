'The West Ham way was beating Manchester United 4-0 on a snowy December night in 2010'... Click here to read our blogger's view on exactly what constitutes the 'West Ham way'

West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan has hit back at Sir Alex Ferguson’s claims in his updated autobiography that he doesn’t know what the "West Ham way" is.

Ferguson wrote, in updated chapters of his book, that he didn't understand the phrase, before going on to claim that the West Ham squad is 'a team of very average players' helped by Sam Allardyce.

But Sullivan has hit back by saying that the Hammers – who play Manchester City on Saturday and are fourth in the Premier League – are playing attacking football that fans want to see.

Writing in the West Ham programme, Sullivan said: 'I read an article this week in which Sir Alex Ferguson said he was not sure what the "West Ham Way" was.

'Personally I think what we are witnessing right now is exactly that. We are playing attacking football with everybody giving 100 per cent and we are getting results at the same time.

'Our strikers have scored nine times this season and given us what we sorely lacked last year - goals.' 

West Ham have won five of their first nine Premier League matches this season, beating Liverpool and Manchester City in the process, and are unlikely occupants of a top-four position.
