A father who disappeared over three months ago from a Sydney hotel after failing to return from a meeting with a business associate is reportedly feared murdered.

Police are concerned for Phuoc Minh (Paul) Nguyen's welfare after he vanished on May 1 after leaving the Hilton Hotel in Sydney's centre.

The 50-year-old, from Sydney's south-west, did not return a hire car and has not accessed his bank accounts since the day he went missing.

Police are appealing for public assistance to locate Phuoc Minh (Paul) Nguyen from Sydney's south-west, who has been missing since May

The Baker’s Delight franchise owner's brother, Tony Nguyen, said the businessman acted out of the ordinary before he went missing.

'He handed my sister-in-law's passport back to her that night and said, "I’m meeting up with someone and it could be complicated",' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.  

Mr Nguyen walked out of the hotel on George Street just before 10pm and was last seen driving from the hotel in a gold-coloured Renault Latitude hire car, with Victorian registration ZXH305.

Police said initial investigations indicated he may have travelled to Bankstown or Cabramatta in Sydney's west however, there are no confirmed sightings of him or the hire car.

Sydney City Police Detective Inspector John Maricic said:'He appeared worried and had a number of previous phone calls during the day and indicated he was concerned about something.'

Mr Nguyen is described as being of Asian appearance, 170cm tall, with a medium build, black hair and brown eyes.

On the day he disappeared he was wearing a white long-sleeved pullover and dark-coloured pants, and carrying a shopping bag from 'VOI' and black satchel over his shoulder.

He had been shopping with his sister-in-law in Sydney the same day and was meant to meet her in the lobby the following morning but never showed up.

Mr Nguyen reportedly sold two Baker's Delight bakery franchises at Carlingford, a Bread Top shop at Chatswood and a Parramatta pizzeria in the months leading up to his disappearance.
