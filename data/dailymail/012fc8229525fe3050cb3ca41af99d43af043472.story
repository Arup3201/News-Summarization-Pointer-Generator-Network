The biggest scare Mercedes have endured in Budapest this week occurred on push-bikes rather than cars.

Sitting around Lewis Hamilton was one of his bosses, Toto Wolff, with a broken wrist and shoulder, another - Paddy Lowe - with cuts and bruises, and senior performance engineer Jock Clear with three cracked ribs - all from a pile-up while riding along the Danube.

In a separate incident one fool, whose identity we will protect, could not get his feet out of the toe clips and toppled down the bank and hit a tree. He is sporting a black eye. Stick to cars, chaps.

In the four-wheel world they continue to dominate. Hamilton was quickest in both sessions in Friday's practice sessions for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix on a demanding track where he has won four times; his team-mate Nico Rosberg was second.

'It should be six wins here!' said Hamilton, whose victory here last year was his first for Mercedes. 'The fans in the UK are the greatest and then here is probably second for me, for some reason.

'From the moment I arrived at the airport this morning there were tons of people with flags and  t-shirts they had made. 

'I love the track. It's an old classic circuit. They don't make them like this anymore. There's a lot of braking and that's where I gain my time generally. You do have to throw the car around more.' 

It was the car throwing him around in qualifying for the German Grand Prix, when his brakes failed and he thudded hard into the tyre wall. Acupuncture, as well as physiotherapy, helped get him ready to race, in which he drove impressively from 20th on the grid to third.

It is the Saturdays that have been weak for Hamilton this season, surprisingly given his reputation as a phenomenal one-lap specialist. He made notable mistakes in Canada, Austria and Britain.

In his pre-race column, Hamilton admitted these failures were becoming costly, saying: 'I've had a difficult run in qualifying - I've not been on pole for five races, and that has not made things easy for me in the championship.

'I feel like I've had the pace to be on pole at all those grands prix but it just hasn't worked out. Some of that has been down to me, and some of it has not. I've made some mistakes and had some bad luck.

'I have no doubt I have the pace; I've just got to start delivering. I don't really know why it hasn't come together. 'We're now heading into a very important period of the year and that part of my game needs to be back to its best.' 

The weather in Budapest was scorchingly hot yesterday, and the sun is expected to stay out today. However, rain is forecast for the race - which would be fun if it is anything like the 2006 edition, when Jenson Button broke his long wait for a Formula One victory.

If it is a dry race, overtaking will be extremely difficult, putting an even greater premium on qualifying than at most other tracks.

Hamilton, who described his 18 months with Mercedes as the best times of his career, is in talks about a new contract. That, though, is  for his manager Simon Fuller to  negotiate while he focuses on the task of winning the world title.

Last night after stepping out of his Mercedes, Hamilton was back to the immediate business, saying: 'We have some work to do overnight to ensure we get the best setup for the weekend as we're not fully  comfortable with the car just yet, but our race pace looked OK. We'll have to look through the data to really know where we stand.' 

Rosberg, however, was pleased that Red Bull had not caught up the Silver Arrows. 'A really encouraging start to the weekend,' said the German. 'The car feels great and is super quick in the corners, so overall I'm quite happy.' 

Away from the track, Sportsmail's story that Formula One would be staging a race in Baku, Azerbaijan was confirmed. It will take place in 2016. There is a suggestion it will be called the European Grand Prix, which seems bizarre: Azerbaijan may be in the Eurovision Song  Contest, but it remains on the Asian side of the Caucuses.  What's wrong with calling it the Azerbaijan Grand Prix?
