Leeds will sign Roma midfielder Federico Viviani on loan for the 2014-15 season.

Sportsmail reported
 last week that Leeds had opened talks with the 22-year-old, and his 
club have now given the move their seal of approval.

Viviani was captain of Romaâ€™s Primavera squad before spending last season on loan at Serie B sides Pescara and Latina.

The Italy U21 international scored five goals in 27 games across the course of the season.

Leeds
 owner Massimo Cellino has signed six new players after adding Sampdoria
 right-back Gaetano Berardi on a two-year deal last week.

Berardi and Viviani join goalkeepers Marco Silvestri and Stuart Taylor, midfielder Tommaso Bianchi and striker Souleymane Doukara as new additions to Dave Hockaday's squad.
