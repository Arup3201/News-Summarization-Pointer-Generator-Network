They may have failed to win a single match at the World Cup, but at least some of the England players didn't come home from Brazil empty-handed.

Arsenal duo Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain suffered a frustrating delay on the tarmac at Luton Airport - to wait for their freebie Xbox One consoles to be removed from the plane.

While their teammates and manager Roy Hodgson disembarked, quickly collected their baggage and scurried off into the waiting fleet of cars, the Arsenal pair were hanging around.

The Xbox consoles, still in their 
distinctive green packaging and labelled with the players' names, were 
checked in as excess luggage and so took a little longer to be taken 
off.

It appears the machines, which retail at around Â£350, were a memento of their visit.

Any hours of relaxation playing on 
them failed to have a positive effect on the team's performance as they 
collected just one point from matches against Italy, Uruguay and Costa 
Rica.
