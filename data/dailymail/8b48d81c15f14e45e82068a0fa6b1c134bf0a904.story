With his seat among the golfing gods already secured, you could forgive Ernie Els for packing his clubs away for good. But when work consists of cruising on a yacht along the shoreline of a paradise island, stopping to hit a few balls into the crystal waters and admire the view, who needs retirement?

Besides, Els simply can't help but compete. Above all, he still wants to win the one major he felt he was born to win. At Augusta National next April Rory McIlroy will attempt to write himself into the history books and Tiger Woods will bid to have his picture printed on the front cover. But Els yearns to beat them both, plus all of golf's young guns, and win the Masters at long last. The green jacket is his holy grail.

'When I was young, I was very cocky and thought I was going to win all the majors by nomination,' he says. 'I thought the Masters was going to be the first one I’d win and then The Open, and then the US Open and US PGA Championship. Well, I haven’t won the Masters so far and I haven’t won the US PGA, so I’m going to try to win the Masters before I retire. This would possibly be my biggest career achievement.'

Els will be 45 when he next drives down Magnolia Lane, so it is hard not to disagree with that sentiment. Jack Nicklaus remains the oldest Masters winner, aged 46 in 1986.

Majors: 4 (US Open - 1994, 1997; The Open - 2002, 2012)

Best finishes in other majors:

Masters: 2nd - 2000, 2004

US PGA Championship: 3rd - 1995, 2007

Professional wins: 67

Other: 

7x World Match Play champion 

World Golf Hall of Fame - 2011

European Tour Order of Merit - 2003, 2004

Sunshine Tour Order of Merit - 1991, 1995

McIlroy will be chasing a career grand slam in the majors and Woods's desire to overhaul Nicklaus's record haul of 18 burns as brightly as ever, so Els will have to do it the hard way. And that's not to mention Bubba Watson's recent miracles at the Cathedral of Pines.

But Els has beaten the odds before, most recently in pipping Adam Scott at The Open in 2012. You could also say he has a score to settle. His US Open wins in 1994 and 1997 seemed to herald an era where he and Woods would share majors between them. But according to his former sports psychologist Jos Vanstiphout, Els developed 'Tigeritis' – a belief that Woods was unbeatable. To be fair his wasn't the only mind troubled by that thought as Woods collected 14 majors in 11 years.

Asked who he considers his toughest opponent, Els turns first to his old foe: 'Back in the day, it was definitely Tiger Woods; he was by far the best. 

'It was tough for me because I felt that I could really be the best player in the world and I was for a short time on paper, but Tiger was really the man to beat. He was a very difficult competitor.

'Nowadays it’s the game itself and the youngsters - Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott, we can go on and on... Jordan Speith. There are so many other really good players.'

Els fails to mention McIlroy but that is surely nothing more than an unintentional slip. Where Els was once denied majors by Woods he must now overcome the likes of the reigning Open and US PGA Champion to claim the four biggest prizes in the game. Els admits that 'the wins aren’t coming as frequently as they used to' - he hasn't won a tournament since the BMW International Open in June 2013 - but insisted 'I really enjoy my game and my time out there'.

Els is addicted to winning. No matter how many time he is knocked down by Woods, McIlroy and the rest, he can't help but haul himself back off the canvas for another pop at the champ.

'Any time you lift a trophy it’s a wonderful and memorable moment,' he admits. 'The joy is indescribable.

'I love competition. I love doing anything if its competition, if it's table tennis or tennis against my daughter, whoever, even a pool game, anything. Competition is what it’s all about. I’ve been competing since I was 10 years old in a lot of different sports, it’s in my blood. I’m still trying, I want to try and win one or two more majors before I’m totally done.'

While the fires of ambition still crackle inside Els, it will not be too many years before he is forced to rage against the dying of his golfing light. For now, however, there is too much still to achieve; most importantly, that green jacket has never been draped over the giant shoulders of the Big Easy.

Off the course, his golf course design business is flourishing following the high-profile and controversial remodelling of Wentworth's iconic West Course. It requires him to travel the globe to work on stunning projects, such as the one that sees him soaking up the sun on this yacht in Malaysia. The Els Club Teluk Datai is built amid a million-year-old rainforest on the island of Langwai in the Andaman sea. Nice work if you can get it. But it doesn't satisfy that yearning for competition.

Els once told the world he was ready to retire to the Caribbean after he'd won a major, but the bar flies of Kingston and Havana are yet to hover around any watering hole of his.

'I said that back in the early 90s. The media asked me "what will happen if you win this US Open?" I said: “Well, I’d just take the money and go to the Caribbean, open a bar and that would be that". Well, that was 21 years ago and I am still trying to win more tournaments, as well as building golf courses all over the world, so I guess that bar is gonna have to wait.'
