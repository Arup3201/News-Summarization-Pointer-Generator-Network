Retirees are returning to work in their droves as many seek to boost their pension income, figures suggest.

One in eight workers aged 65 to 74 were not in employment a decade earlier – either because they were retired, unemployed or caring for a loved one.

The Office for National Statistics study suggests thousands of so-called 'boomerang pensioners' are returning to employment for financial reasons or because they miss working.

More than a third of those who had come back to work were retired ten years previously. Women were even more likely to come out of retirement than men. 

Workers from Wales and the north of England were the most likely to return to work after not working in their late fifties and early sixties.

Lisa Harris, of over-50s specialist firm Saga, said: 'News that older people are returning to work is good, however scratch below the surface and it reveals that for some this decision isn't always entirely driven by choice.

'Many older men and women may have had to retire to care for loved ones or to help look after their grandchildren. But when these caring responsibilities subside, many find they need to return to work either for financial reasons, or simply to keep themselves busy.

'In addition there will have been relatively large numbers of people who decided to retire early, but have found that the dream of retirement has failed to live up to their expectations, either financially or socially.'

Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: 'For those that do return to work, more often than not the only jobs available are low-paid and part-time.'
