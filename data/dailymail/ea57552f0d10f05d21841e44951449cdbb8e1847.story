Jonathan Ross has returned to Radio Two - the station that sacked him over a prank phone call - despite a raft of complaints from listeners.

The chat show host is once again standing in for Steve Wright, 60, on show Steve Wright in the Afternoon - despite the BBC receiving 100 complaints since his last cover shift and criticism on social media.

It is more than six years since he disgraced himself when he and comedian Russell Brand crudely mocked Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs and his family on air.

Jonathan Ross has returned to Radio Two - the station that sacked him over a prank phone call - despite hundreds of complaints from listeners. It is more than six years since he disgraced himself when he and comedian Russell Brand crudely mocked Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs and his family on air

The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the actor’s granddaughter Georgina and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls. Brand later resigned and Ross, who had his own regular Radio 2 show, was suspended for 12 weeks

Ross had been hired to cover the afternoon show in February while Steve Wright was on holiday and was once again hosting the show today. 

But listeners have been left far from impressed.  

One posted on the Points of View message board: ‘I have read all 70 messages. Many reflect my opinion of this dreadful man. 

'I just want to put in a fervent request to the BBC. Please don’t let him back on radio or t.v. I could avoid him on THE OTHER CHANNEL. At the moment he is just spoiling my afternoons, Please make him stop.’ 

Another added: ‘I’ll find another station to listen to when I go out in the car tomorrow.’

One posted on Twitter: ‘BBC’s shown double standards over Clarkson case - Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand get away with murder!!’

In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave obscene messages on Sachs’s answering machine.

The Sachs family have refused to forgive Ross and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career

The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the actor’s granddaughter Georgina and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls.

Brand later resigned and Ross, who had his own regular Radio 2 show, was suspended for 12 weeks.

He subsequently moved to ITV, while the BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom for the shameful episode.

After last month's show listeners questioned the choice of Ross to stand-in for Wright. One wrote on Twitter: ‘All is forgiven then? Didn’t think @wossy would ever “darken” hallowed BBC premises again.’

Another posted: ‘And Jonathan Ross is on BBC Radio 2 hosting a show because? My God, just shows you can get away with anything and still asked back. Shameful!’

Others said they had switched their radios off, with one tweeting: ‘Disgrace they let this clown back on radio. Never again please.’

Although Ross – who left the BBC in 2010 after it decided not to renew his £18million contract – has said he feels ‘immense regret’, the Sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career.

Last month Sachs’s wife Melody said of Ross: ‘I think it’s dreadful that he’s back at the BBC. I don’t like it because of what he did to us. They carry on regardless. He’s never off the box now, is he?

‘He can do what he likes – walk over anybody, say what he likes. I just put it out of my mind and can’t be bothered any more.

'But I’m careful to switch the TV or radio off when he’s on. It’s not very nice, especially the way Andrew’s worked all his life for the BBC on radio and TV. It’s an absolute insult, really.’

Ross will cover another ten shows for Wright next month. The presenter, who has also been guest on Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute since his fall from grace, hosted Wright’s show for four days over the August bank holiday weekend last year, for which he was paid an estimated £4,000.

A BBC spokesman told MailOnline: 'Jonathan has stood in as holiday cover on several occasions previously and is popular with the Radio 2 audience. 

'Of the 8 million listeners who tune in each week, we've received many messages of support and only a small number of less than 100 complaints. 

'We hope the majority of listeners will continue to enjoy Jonathan’s show.'
