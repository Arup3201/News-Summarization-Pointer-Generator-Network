Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen will have to wait until after the first of December for their futures to finally be resolved.

McLaren have confirmed there will be no announcement prior to that date, leaving the duo in limbo for another fortnight.

Group chief executive Ron Dennis stated over the course of the Italian Grand Prix weekend in early September he would deliver his decision before the season's end.

At the time, Dennis said: 'As for a decision (on driver line-up), it certainly won't be in the next few days and it won't be at the end of the season, it will be something in between.'

Dennis, however, has now reneged on such comments as, via their Twitter feed, McLaren said: 'Guys, we know you're awaiting news on our driver line-up. We'll announce after Dec 1 - you'll hear it here first. All eyes now on Abu Dhabi.'

Fernando Alonso is expected to return to the Woking-based team from 2015 when Honda become power-unit partners, with this weekend's race in Abu Dhabi ending the marque's 20-season association with Mercedes-Benz.

Magnussen is on 55 points in the drivers' standings, but his team-mate Button has 106

The choice for the second seat comes down to a straight fight between veteran Button and young Dane Magnussen, now approaching the end of his first year in F1.

Racing director Eric Boullier is understood to favour Button given his experience, which in tandem with Alonso would help drive on Honda, whilst Dennis prefers Magnussen.

Via a statement, McLaren added: 'Selecting the optimal driver line-up for a Formula One team is clearly an important process, and it is therefore one that requires precise and prolonged analysis.

'That being the case, and in order to avoid distracting the race team from its primary objective during the final grand prix weekend of the season, which is to secure the best possible on-track results, we have decided to defer our final deliberations relating to our 2015 driver line-up until a date no earlier than Monday December 1st.'
