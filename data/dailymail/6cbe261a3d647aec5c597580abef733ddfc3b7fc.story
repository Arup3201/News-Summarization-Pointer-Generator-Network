A British soldier has died in hospital a day after he was injured in action in Afghanistan.

The Ministry of Defence announced this afternoon that the soldier from 1st Battalion The Mercian Regiment died after he was injured as a result of 'enemy action'.

The soldier, who has not been named, suffered his injuries while serving in the Nad 'Ali district of Helmand Province and was flown to hospital for treatment.

He was hurt in a suspected suicide bomb attack which injured at least 10 troops.

The soldier was wounded in the Helmand province of Afghanistan yesterday and died in hospital today the MoD confirmed

Spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Major Matt Allen, said: 'It is with deep regret that I must report the death of a soldier from 1st Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire) who has died as a result of wounds sustained during an insurgent attack in Nad ‘Ali in Helmand province.

'His death comes as a great loss to all serving in Task Force Helmand.

'Our thoughts and prayers are extended to his family and friends at this difficult time.'

Kingsman David Robert Shaw was the last British soldier killed in Afghanistan back in January

The soldier's family have been informed of his death the MoD confirmed.

At least ten British troops were injured after the suspected suicide bombing in the Nad 'Ali area last night.

One of the soldiers who was hurt in the attack was said to have been severely wounded and was airlifted back to Camp Bastion for treatment.

He is said to have died before he could be airlifted back to the UK for further treatment.

Five insurgents were killed in a gun battle that followed close to a patrol base.

The Nad 'Ali area had been regarded as relatively calm after troops had gradually driven insurgents into the desert and taken control of the area.

The soldier is the first British soldier to be killed in Afghanistan for more than two months and the third so far in 2013.

In all, 441 UK service personnel have been killed since fighting began in the country back in 2001.

Kingsman David Robert Shaw, 23, from 
1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, was the last British 
soldier to be killed in Helmand province back in January.

He died after he was shot when his checkpoint came under attack from insurgents in the Lashkar Gah district.

The number of British troops deployed in Afghanistan has gradually been reduced with the remainder to be removed from active duty by the end of 2014.

A few will remain in the country after that but in support roles or to train Afghan police officers in special academies.
