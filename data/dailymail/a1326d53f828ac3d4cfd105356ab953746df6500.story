A new Syrian airline plans to fly out of Damascus to destinations across the Middle East despite a three year civil war which has devastated the region. 

Esmail Sharaf, vice commercial manager, said Kinda Airlines will operate out of Damascus International Airport and the coastal city of Latakia. 

It aims to fly to more than 10 destinations within a year, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, and 'hopefully Lebanon and Jordan'.

He said the company had registered a Boeing 737-400 from Jordan Aviation and signed a contract for an Airbus 320 with Aeolus Air, a company registered in Gambia and with offices in the United Arab Emirates. 

Syria's civil war has killed more than 140,000 people since it started in 2011.

Sharaf said there had been a lot of demand for a second carrier other than the national airline Syrianair, which he said had flown out of Damascus throughout the conflict.

'Damascus (airport) has been very safe in the last six or seven months,' he said.

Kinda Airlines' debut flight was first scheduled for January. It then put back until April 1 but now wont happen until May 1 due to 'documents that are not ready and some paperwork inside Syria.'

The start-up has also had to deal with wide-ranging European Union, Arab League and U.S. sanctions on Syria.

Syrianair has had to ground planes in the past when it was unable to buy new parts for its fleet.

'(Sanctions are) making it very, very difficult. Hopefully we have passed through all these difficulties,' Sharaf said. 

Syrianair maintained a 40-year monopoly until 2008, when parliament approved the creation of Syrian Pearl Airways (SPA), a venture by Rami Makhlouf, Assad's cousin, who is under sanctions. 

SPA closed only a month after it launched when the Spanish company which leased its planes had to terminate contracts due to U.S. sanctions. 

Sharaf said Kinda Airlines' three main shareholders were all private Syrian citizens.
