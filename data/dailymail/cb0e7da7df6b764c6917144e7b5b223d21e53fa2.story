Two teenage girls died yesterday after jumping into a notoriously dangerous river.

They are thought to have leapt up to 30ft from a bridge at a spot that has become popular among teenagers for ‘tombstoning’.

A witness said the girls, aged around 14, were part of a group who were daring each other to jump into the fast-flowing Wear in Fatfield, Washington, near Sunderland.

Missing:  A desperate search is underway after Chloe Fowler, 13, left, and Toni-Beth Purvis, 15, right, went missing in the River Wear this afternoon. Police dive teams this evening recovered two female bodies

Two girls were seen in the water in the River Wear near Washington, Tyne and Wear this afternoon

But last night, police denied that the
girls had been tombstoning – a dangerous craze in which participants 
jump into water from great heights.

A spokesman said that nobody saw them jump from the bridge and it is unclear where they jumped from.

Last night police said that the bodies
of both girls had been recovered from the Wear. The girls, named 
locally as Chloe Fowler and Toni-Beth Purvis, disappeared under the 
water at 3pm after witnesses saw the younger of the two struggling for 
breath and the older one jumping in after her.

It is thought a boy jumped in to help 
them, followed by an off-duty police officer who was jogging nearby. The
officer dragged the boy to safety but was unable to find the girls.

Police said a member of the public, 
possibly the father of one of the girls, also swam across the river but 
could not reach them.

Around 100 rescue and emergency 
service personnel, backed up by a police helicopter, hunted for the 
girls, but last night the search was scaled down after two bodies were 
found.

Search teams were working on the banks of the river yesterday and recovered a body late last night

Boats were launched and emergency services staff were alerted to the incident just before 3pm yesterday

Superintendent Alan Veitch, of 
Northumbria Police, said: ‘The parents are distraught and need a lot of 
support and we are providing them with every assistance we can.’

He said the river was tidal up to a 
point upstream from where the children went missing, and that there was a
lot of debris and foliage in the water.

‘Today was one of the hottest days of 
the year, it’s the school holidays and it’s tempting to go in the 
water,’ he added.

‘There are big, strong powerful river currents and 
this is not the place to lark about.’

The bridge is over a wide stretch of 
the river, which is lower than usual after the recent heatwave.

A 
witness, who is a neighbour of one of the girls, said: ‘There was a 
group of about five older lads and they were daring the girls to jump 
into the water.

Missing: Eyewitnesses said the girls were jumping from the jetty into a relatively slow-flowing stretch of the river

‘At that point the river was very low 
which meant they were jumping from about 20 or 30 feet, about the height
of a two-storey house. It’s really murky and they just disappeared 
under.’

Locals said the currents in the river were notoriously strong and several others have drowned there.

Witnesses said they thought the member of the public who dived in may have been one of the girls’ fathers.

Paul Cronin, 63, said: ‘This gentleman came running up towards the park dressed in his boxer shorts.

‘He had just crawled out of the river and had nearly drowned himself. He was screaming at me, “Can you swim?”.’

Mr Cronin went to the river with the 
would-be rescuer, but when he got there he saw no sign of the girls. ‘By
the time I got there it was too late,’ he said. ‘Some of the kids had 
been messing around and threatening to push each other in.’
