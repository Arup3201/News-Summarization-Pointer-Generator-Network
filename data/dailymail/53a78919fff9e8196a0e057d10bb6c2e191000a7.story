Loyal: Steven Tyler, 29, was dismissed after 11 years working for the supermarket

A loyal Sainsbury’s worker who was sacked after leaving the store for just two minutes to get change for a coffee has received a £10,000 payout.

Steven Tyler, 28, had worked as a baker at the supermarket for 11 years when he was dismissed for leaving his post during a night shift.

CCTV footage captured him walking out the back of the store on August 24 last year. He was fired after his manager told him he did not have permission to leave, an offence which amounted to ‘gross misconduct’.

Mr Tyler, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, was paid out around £10,000 in lost earnings and severance pay after winning his claim for wrongful dismissal.

After winning his case on Wednesday, Mr Tyler said: ‘I will never set foot in Sainsbury’s again.

‘I had worked there for 11 years and you expect some support after working there for so long.

‘I just went out to get some money so I could get a coffee to keep me going through the night shift but they treated me like a criminal.

‘It was disgusting the way I was treated and I’m relieved they have been made to pay up.’

Mr Tyler was working at the Sainsbury’s branch in Kidderminster when he was transferred to a store in Amblecote, Stourbridge, Worcestershire while the shop underwent a refurbishment.

But half-way through his night shift he claims he asked his line manager if he could fetch his coat from his friend’s car which was parked in the store’s car park.

He said: ‘I’d got a lift with a friend but I’d left my coat with all my money in it in his car so just nipped out for less than two minutes to collect it.

‘When I walked back into the store my manager asked me where I had been and claimed he’d never given me permission to leave my post.

‘I was the subject of a disciplinary where CCTV was used showing me walking into the car park which I never disputed, but they claimed I was guilty of gross misconduct and I was sacked.

‘What is most galling is that Sainsbury’s have a policy allowing smokers to take fag breaks but when I asked and got permission to get some change for a cuppa I got fired.’

Steven, who is married with a step-daughter and two young sons, has now got a job at a vacuum packing factory in Kidderminster.

He said: ‘I’m now in this dead-end job at a vacuum-packing factory.

‘When I applied for jobs after the sacking I was asked why I had left my old job and I had to tell them. After that no one would get back to me. I became really depressed and had to be medicated. I was worried about my family as I had no idea how I could support them.

‘I got permission from my manager, but he later claimed he hadn’t done that.’

He added that some of his friends who worked with him in the bakery came to be witnesses at the tribunal.

‘Now I can get my life back on track, it was never about the money, it was always about getting what was right.

‘I have been asked by the company not to disclose the exact amount they paid me but it was close to £10,000.’

During the tribunal in Birmingham, Sainsbury’s said employees could only leave the premises during the night with official permission because of 'security and health and safety regulations'.

Sainsbury's today admitted they were wrong to sack Steven Tyler after he left the store to collect some change for a coffee. 

A spokesman said: 'To ensure that everyone who works on the night shift is safe we ask our colleagues to seek permission before they leave the store.

'However, we accept that we applied the rules too vigorously on this occasion.'
