The days of unreliable forecasts could be over - as the Met Office has started using a computer programme so powerful it can foretell the weather across every mile of the country.

It is hoped the ENDGame model will be able to accurately predict the thunderstorms, black ice, and flash floods which are caused by weather systems too severe or small to be seen by current programmes.

The breakthrough comes after the Met Office was criticised for its ‘pitiful’ forecasts last winter – thought to be the worst predictions since Michael Fish’s infamous reassurance that there was no hurricane on the way in October 1987.

The Met Office has started using a computer programme that can foretell the weather across every mile of the country. It was criticised for its 'pitiful' forecasts which predicted a dry winter, only for the country to experience some of the worst flooding since records began - including in Somerset (pictured)

ENDGame will 
work by building a virtual model of the UK. The technology will then 
enable meteorologists to pinpoint the weather at 100 metre points on the
 ground and up to 11 miles above ground.

Last winter forecasters predicted a large area of the country which includes the Somerset Levels – still under water after more than two months of flooding – would most likely see rainfall levels well below average.

Instead it was confirmed the UK had instead suffered the wettest winter since records began.

The Met Office stopped publishing its long-range forecasts for the public to see in 2010, after its disastrous prediction of a ‘barbeque summer’ in 2009 – which ended in washouts throughout July and August.

The three-month forecasts are now sent only to contingency planners, such as councils,  government departments, and insurance companies.

Until now, even powerful super-computers have been able to perform only slightly better than chance when predicting long-term weather conditions.

But the latest model, which simulates the climate on a more detailed scale, was found to be 62 per cent accurate at broad predictions of weather conditions when it was tested on 20 years of retrospective data.

Dramatic: A stormy winter this year followed wrongly-placed reassurances from the Met Office

And scientists at the Met Office claim the reliability will improve, estimating that accuracy will increase to 80 per cent.

The breakthrough is due to stronger computing power, allowing scientists to take into account much smaller changes in the gulfstream and Arctic sea ice coverage, which impact on the British climate.

Dr David Walters, manager of the Global Atmospheric Model Development group, said: This development took 10 years and in the past two years staff from across the Met Office have tested and evaluated its impact and prepared our operational systems for its implementation.

Stuff of legend: Michael Fish famously failed to predict the 1987 hurricane - but he relied on others' data

'In global models, ENDGame's improved accuracy and reduced damping produces more detail in synoptic features such as cyclones, fronts and jet stream winds. The last of these is particularly important for the aviation industry, which relies on accurate forecasts of the jet streams for planning intercontinental flights.

'ENDGame's improved scalability means that we can produce a global weather prediction as quickly as our current operational system, but with its resolution increased from 25 km to 17 km. This enhanced resolution (or higher definition) provides additional improvements to forecast accuracy. Better scalability means that we will be able to further increase the model's resolution on delivery of our next supercomputer.'

The programme was designed by Professor John Thuburn from the University of Exeter . ENDGame stands for Even Newer Dynamics for General atmospheric modelling of the environment.
