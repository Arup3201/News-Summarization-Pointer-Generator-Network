More first-year students from China have enrolled at UK universities than those from the whole of the EU put together.

Last year, 58,810 Chinese undergraduates started their study here, while students from the continent, excluding those from the UK itself, totalled 57,190.

However numbers of students from India and Pakistan have dropped by more than a thousand, official figures show, suggesting the Government's attempts to restrict student visas has put undergraduates off studying in Britain.

The number of Chinese first-years coming to the UK has increased by 59 per cent since 2009/10, when 36,950 new students enrolled, figures revealed by the Higher Educations Statistics Agency show.

There is a culture of studying abroad for Chinese students, who are often attracted to the UK because of its top universities, with nine British institutions in the world's top 100.

The number of non-EU students in the UK rose to 310,195 - up three per cent in a year - but education experts were concerned with the fall in students from India and Pakistan.

Gordon Slaven, director of higher education at the British Council, said: 'It is very pleasing that the overall figures for non-EU students coming to the UK has increased by three per cent.

'But this headline figure does disguise one worrying trend: the decrease of students coming from India by 12 per cent and Pakistan by seven per cent, while demographic trends suggest these should be sources of growth for the UK.

'While the UK sector can be pleased that the overall numbers have increased, our competitor countries such as the USA and Australia have shown much more significant increases.

The number of international students coming to the UK has risen to 310,915 - up three per cent - despite restrictions on student visas (file picture)

'This highlights the need for the UK to take a much more proactive and united approach to attracting highly talented students from around the world to reduce the risk of losing our share of the international student market.'

Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of vice-chancellors' group Universities UK, told the Independent: 'Problems remain with recruitment from India. There is growing demand for quality higher education around the world, so the UK should be capitalising on this, rather than seeing the stagnation of the past few years.' 

Total number of non-EU students: 310,195 (up three per cent).

Total number of EU students*: 125,300 (no change).

Total number of Chinese students: 87,895 (up four per cent).

First-year non-EU students: 179,390 (up four per cent).

First-year EU students*: 57,190 (up two per cent).

First year Chinese students: 58,810 (up four per cent).

The latest official figures also show that  a record numbers of students graduated with a first-class degree last summer, with one in five achieving top honours.

Around 79,440 students got a first last year, nearly 10,000 more than did so in 2013. A decade ago only one in 10 graduates left with a first.

Meanwhile 70 per cent of students graduated with a first or a 2:1, sparking concerns the classification system is out of date.

Graduate recruitment expert Martin Birchall, of High Fliers Research, said: 'With ever higher numbers of school-leavers going to university, employers are increasingly insisting that students applying for graduate jobs have at least a 2.1.

'As the proportion of candidates with these top degree classifications goes up, it's making it harder and harder for employers to distinguish between candidates.

'Most employers now look well beyond students' academic qualifications when they're assessing applications for their graduate vacancies and rather than rely on degree classifications, many resort to putting candidates through their own battery of tests to find out who are the brightest graduates.'
