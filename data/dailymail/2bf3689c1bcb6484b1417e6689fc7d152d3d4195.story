This is the dramatic moment a brazen thief persuaded a jeweller to let him try on a £8,000 Rolex watch before running out of the store and getting away.

Store manager Diane Devonshire had just placed the stainless steel watch on the man’s wrist when he turned on his heels and fled.

Mrs Devonshire, who runs David Mellor Jewellers in Eastleigh, Hampshire, said she tried not to ‘judge a book by its cover’ when she allowed him to try on one of the shop’s most expensive items.

Seconds after she placed the £8,000 watch on the man's wrist he turned on his heels and fled the store

Mrs Devonshire turned to grab the man and chased after him as he made off out of the shopping centre

The man, believed to be between 24 and 26-years-old, can be seen pacing up and down in front of the store’s entrance and looking inside several times.

The shop worker walks out and speaks to the man before he follows her inside, asking to try on the watch – a pre-owned Rolex Sea-Dweller.

She gets the valuable timepiece out from the display and slowly puts it on seconds before he makes his getaway.

The jeweller ran after him through the shopping centre and told her colleague to shut the doors and she fled, but did not want to leave the shop with one member of staff so gave up the chase.

Mrs Devonshire said: ‘He was a young lad looking at an expensive watch but I don't judge a book by its cover.

‘I put the watch on more slowly than I normally would, to keep a hold on it, and even held onto the price tags.

‘But as soon as it was done up he just fled. I chased him up to the road, then I thought he's going to have it anyway.

‘I nearly had him at the doors, though I don't know what I would have done.

‘It wasn't brave, it was a natural instinct.’

It is only the second time she has fallen victim to a snatch in 25 years.

Staff were left shaken by the incident and security has been stepped up.

Now the store is offering a £1,000 reward to catch the man, who was wearing a blue short sleeved shirt, jean shorts and Ray Ban sunglasses.

Police are hunting for a slim white man, around 5ft 9in tall with short mousey coloured hair.
