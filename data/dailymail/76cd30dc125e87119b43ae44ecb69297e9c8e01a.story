A 'jealous and controlling' teenager has been found guilty of murdering his pregnant 16-year-old girlfriend with a scarf and will serve at least 14 years in jail.

Aston Robinson, 18, repeatedly punched Kayleigh-Anne Palmer - who was 24 weeks pregnant -before strangling her so she would 'be quiet'.

Robinson lashed out at the schoolgirl after getting into an argument about boys she had spoken to, Bristol Crown Court heard.

The lifeless mother-to-be was rushed to hospital where she was placed on a ventilator and her unborn daughter died a day later 

While Kayleigh lay dying, Robinson fled the scene before calmly heading to a local bookies to check the status of a £20 bet. 

Her mother Helen Bage, father Dean Palmer and grandparents, Michael and Carole, said the verdict would help bring closure on the distressing time in their lives.

In a statement they said: 'Justice has been done for Kayleigh and we wish to thank the jury for their verdict which will help us bring closure on what has been a very distressing time.

'Kay will be remembered by her family and friends for her huge personality and radiant smile and our lives are so much richer for having known and loved her.

'She was a young girl who loved life yet always found time for others, which is why she will be remembered for being beautiful inside and out.

'To us, Lily Rose will always be the little girl who would have been welcomed into our lives and loved very much.

'While her loss of life has caused much grief and suffering, we will try to take some comfort from knowing that she rests in peace together with her mummy.'

The lifeless mother-to-be was rushed to hospital where she was placed on a ventilator and her unborn daughter died a day later.

During an interview with police Robinson told officers he grabbed her red tartan scarf from the table and wrapped it around Kayleigh's throat, pulling it tight at both ends

Kayleigh's mother, Helen Bage, issued a statement with the rest of the family saying: 'Kay will be remembered for her huge personality and radiant smile and our lives are so much richer for having known and loved her'

She tragically passed away three days after the incident.

Robinson handed himself into police and confessed to killing his girfriend, but denied her murder.

He later wrote a letter to Kayleigh's mother from prison where he insisted he had not meant to kill the 16-year-old.

Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, said: 'He said, 'I'm so sorry for your loss. I didn't want that to happen. I was hoping that when she woke up, and after my jail sentence, I would go back to her arms.

'God took her way in peace, away from my accusations and my controlling behaviour.'

Mr Quinlan added: 'But God didn't take Kayleigh away, this jealous and controlling young man murdered her.

'His senseless act of violence also destroyed the life on an unborn child.

'He said he used her own scarf and did it because he was jealous and wanted her to 'be quiet'.'

Kayleigh had reported her boyfriend to police on a number of occasions after he had punched and kicked her following fights, the court heard.

On one occasion Kayleigh even went to hospital with a bloody nose when he punched her hard to the face.

The court heard that when the schoolgirl, from Cheltenham, told Robinson she was pregnant he reacted badly, pushing her to the ground before shouting at her, 'this will stop you having a baby'.

The day before her death Robinson sent Kayleigh text messages and told her: 'Make sure my name is not on your s****y kid's birth certificate'

Just days later police were called after a distressed Kayleigh told a stranger she had been punched in the face following another argument with her boyfriend of six months, the court heard.

She was taken to accident and emergency where staff reported the abuse.

Mr Quinlan said: 'He suffered with paranoia where she was concerned. He was jealous and became jealous when he even thought that she was, or might, have lied to him.

'She said he had become jealous and accused her of looking at another boy so he punched her to the face causing the injuries.

'These episodes of violence, hostility towards the fact she was pregnant, and his jealousy manifested itself in accusations that she was seeing other boys.

'Their relationship was punctuated by his inability just to let her be.'

The day before her death Robinson sent Kayleigh text messages and told her, 'Make sure my name is not on your s****y kid's birth certificate'.

The message was swiftly followed by another, to her mother, which read, 'Make sure you tell Kayleigh I'm having nothing to do with her or the baby'.

Robinson, also from Cheltenham, then turned up to Kayleigh's house where the pair rowed once more before he left.

The following day Kayleigh got ready for school, kissed her mum goodbye and left for Robinson's house.

Another argument developed there over boys Kayleigh had been talking to, and when she said 'how would you like it if I had met some boys?' Robinson lashed out.

During an interview with police he told officers he grabbed her red tartan scarf from the table and wrapped it around Kayleigh's throat, pulling it tight at both ends.

He said she offered no resistance and did not struggle, and he dragged her from the sofa to the floor.

When she stopped moving he rolled her over and, after discovering she was blue, immediately bolted from the property at 11.45am.

He ran into his sister, Michaela, who discovered Kayleigh lying face down on the living room floor and attempted to resuscitate her.

Robinson later handed himself in at Cheltenham police station.

Handwritten letter Robinson sent to Kayleigh's mother Helen Bage

'Helen I can't get over the fact that Kay is gone, my Kay is gone. It's hurting me so much. I haven't slept for days, all I can think of is Kay. My mind keeps replaying the day when it happened.

'I know that she loved me. She used to cry loads when we'd argue and I'd say let's have space for a while, she always used to say 'I can't Ast, I need you all the time, FOREVER, she used to say that I made her complete, and happy.

'I know that she had changed since with me, but it wasn't all bad, she would always have a smile on her beautiful face when she saw me.

'She trusted me with everything and I ruined it all. I just can't get my head around her lying about saying she had chucked her phone when I knew that she didn't.

'I blame myself of that because I never let her say negative things about herself and she obviously needed someone to talk to.

'Our 14 months together were absolute perfect, from when we first started talking we both knew we was going to be together, the way we looked at each other was just love glistening in our eyes.

'Helen I am wordless for the pain I have caused to your family. Just forgive me one day would you please.

'I'll always remember Kay, from when we went to Birmingham and tried to runaway, and the hotel wanted I.D. and neither had any so we got the train back and snuck into my house lol x all the sleepovers we had, the nights when we just used to lay there and stare at the stars with her in my arms, I used to pick her up in my shoulders.

'She used to scream when we walked up Leckhampton Hill at night to get over her fears, she would squeeze my hand hard as she could.

'Look, what I'm trying to get at is I will always love Kayleigh there's no-one out there what will ever replace her in my heart - single forever me...

'I'm so sorry for the loss I didn't want that to happen - I was hoping that when she waked up and after my jail sentence, I would get back into Kay's arms, but God took her away in peace, away from my accusations and my controlling behaviour...

'All that because I loved + adored her. R.I.P Snay.'
