A 41-year-old man was arrested today on suspicion of attempting to steal a large painting from an art gallery, after CCTV of the bungled art heist went viral online.

Footage released by West Midlands Police showed a thief repeatedly try to stuff a large framed piece of art down his grey hoodie before giving up and brazenly walking out with it under his arm.

The incident last month at Castle Fine Art Gallery in Birmingham saw the attempted theft of a £700 commemorative First World War sculpture by artist Nic Joly called Never Forgotten.

CCTV footage has caught the moment a would-be art thief walked into a gallery in Birmingham, before casually plucking a piece of valuable First World War art from the wall

The footage shows him walking around the gallery before casually pulling at a painting to see if it is attached to the wall

The video shows him trying to stuff the large painting under his hooded jumper

CCTV showed a man having a look around the gallery on August 17 before taking the work off the wall and attempting to conceal it under his clothes.

But
 he allegedly soon realised the 17in frame was too big to hide - and the
 film showed him stroll out the main doors with it tucked under his left
 arm. He was immediately spotted by staff.

The
 man then allegedly returned the piece when challenged, before fleeing 
the scene. The 55-second clip was released on Wednesday and attracted 
more than 200,000 views on YouTube.

A
 force spokesman said: ‘The footage was released in a bid to trace the 
offender and as a result the 41-year-old arrested from his home address 
in Small Heath on suspicion of the theft.

The would-be thief then tries the painting another way, again, with no success

He then gives up and tucks it under his arm. The attempted theft happened just before 5pm on Sunday 17 August in Castle Fine Art Gallery on Broad Street

Unfortunately for him staff spotted the large frame under his arms has he tried to make his way out of the museum doors

The artwork which the crook attempted to steal was entitled 'Never Forgotten' by Nic Joly.
The sculpture, depicting two soldiers raising a red poppy, was mounted in a frame

‘He is currently assisting officers with their inquiries.’

Before
 the arrest, a spokesman for Castle Galleries said: 'On Sunday August 
17, during our trading hours, a man made an attempt to steal a piece of 
artwork from our Castle Fine Art, ICC gallery.

'We
 were saddened at this attempted theft most particularly because the 
piece in question, “Never Forgotten” by British sculptor Nic Joly, was 
created as a limited edition to commemorate the recent First World War 
centenary.

'One hundred 
pounds from each sale will be donated to The Royal British Legion in 
support of the excellent work they do for the British Armed Forces past 
and present.

'This gallery, 
and all of our galleries, are fitted with the latest CCTV technology and
 our staff are fully trained to deal with many types of situation, such 
as theft, safely, without putting themselves at risk.’
