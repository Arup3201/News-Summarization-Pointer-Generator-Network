Disgraced: Dave Lee Travis leaves Southwark Crown Court in central London yesterday after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a young TV researcher

Dave Lee Travis is facing fresh accusations of sexually abusing a primary school pupil, just a day after he was found guilty of groping a woman behind the scenes of a television show.

The alleged victim is understood to be preparing to bring a civil action against the former Top Of The Pops host, 69, claiming his abuse had caused her 'life-long consequences'.

Her claim, dating back to the 1970s, is believed to be one of seven separate allegations against Travis that prosecutors chose not to pursue, but her lawyer says she is determined to take her case to the civil courts.

Alan Collins of Slater & Gordon told the Daily Mirror: 'One of the victims we represent alleges extremely serious abuse by Travis when she was a child.

'She was particularly vulnerable at the time and the abuse has had lifelong consequences.

'She complained to the police and DLT denies the assault, but she wants this man's actions to be brought to light and for him to answer for them.'

Travis has denied the allegation. He has also previously insisted to police that he 'didn't mess with young girls.' 

Details of the allegation emerged as a mother-of-two came forward with claims that Travis had groped her when she was just 18 years old.

Jayne Bird, now 46, claimed the shamed broadcaster pressed her against his car and groped her breasts after he asked her to help him carry his bags.

Ms Bird added her voice to calls that Travis be jailed after his conviction yesterday for indecently assaulting a young researcher in her early 20s on the Mrs Merton show in 1995.

He was cleared of another charge and the jury could not make their mind up on a third, which was recorded as not guilty since it was the second time the facts had proved inconclusive.

Ms Bird said she never went to police over her alleged encounter with Travis. She said she and some friends had caught up with the veteran DJ in a pub after he had performed in a pantomime in Catford, south east London.

'He kept watching me the whole time,' she told The Sun. 'Then he came up and asked me to help him with some bags.' She says she agreed and walked out with him to his car.

'Then he said, "Can I have a hug?" I kind of agreed. But he didn't hug me, he groped me. He grabbed me and pushed me against the car and kissed me and grabbed my breasts,' said Ms Bird.

She told how she pushed Travis away and fended off his advances a second time. Nevertheless, she said, he tried to coax her into his car to go 'for a drive'.

Ms Bird said she never thought of going to the police, but has come forward since his conviction to because she wants people to know the attack on a TV researcher was not a one-off.

That victim has told how Travis groped her for a ‘weird sexual thrill’ when she was a young researcher on the Mrs Merton Show.

She fled to her boss, BBC producer Peter Kessler, and told him: ‘Oh my God, Dave Lee Travis just grabbed my t**s.’

But the allegation was not pursued by the corporation. The woman has since become a successful entertainer in her own right, and admitted in court that she has spoken publicly about Travis’s wandering hands.

She said she had added humour to make it ‘palatable for the audience’, and defended her choice, saying it was a ‘positive and healthy’ way for her to cope with the assault.

Despite speaking publicly about the assault in the past, the woman has not waived her legal right to anonymity as a victim of sexual assault. Last night her agent said she did not wish to say anything. No official complaint was ever lodged at the corporation, which has come under fire for turning a blind eye to Jimmy Savile’s abuse of girls and boys on its premises.

At the time of the assault, in January 1995, the victim was in her early 20s. Travis cornered her in a corridor and chastised her for smoking.

He told her: ‘You shouldn’t be smoking – think about what it is doing to your poor little lungs.’

Travis then touched her ribcage before sliding his hands up to her breasts in a ‘squeezing grope’. She said the assault ‘felt like ages’ but lasted about ten to 15 seconds before she escaped his clutches. ‘It was the weirdest thing that had happened to me,’ said the woman, who gave evidence without a screen, in view of Travis in the dock.

‘One minute I am meeting this radio DJ and the next minute I am being sexually assaulted by him.’

In his police interview, Travis accused the woman of ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ in a bid to boost her career.

‘It’s just good PR for her to have comments saying, “You know what? DLT groped her”,’ he told detectives.

‘I remember the days when people touched other people and you kick them in the b***s and say “don’t be silly”. You don’t take them to bloody court.’

The victim came forward during Travis’s first trial, but was too late to be added to the charges.

Travis has always insisted he is an 'easy target' since the beginning of investigations into historic abuse by celebrities. Conceding in evidence that he was 'not an angel', he nevertheless denounced his accusers as fantasists who came forward to make money from the media.
