Melbourne could be a contender to host another Olympic Games with Victorian Premier Denis Napthine admitting the city 'ticks many of the boxes'.

But he says a lot of work is required before deciding on a formal bid.

The Committee for Melbourne has called for the city to bid for the 2028 Games, but Dr Napthine is less sold on the idea.

Victorian Premier Denis Napthine says Melbourne had the right facilities in place to host another Olympic Games

'We are a sporting city. We've got fantastic facilities. We are well-placed to deliver a major sporting event like the Olympic Games,' he told reporters on Thursday.

But Dr Napthine said any bid would need the support of state and federal governments.

'We tick many of the boxes, but you'd certainly need to do a lot of work before you went into a formal bidding process,' he said.

Dr Napthine said it would be expensive to bid for the Games so work would have to be done to see if there was a genuine prospect of success.

The last time an Australian city hosted a games was Sydney in 2000

Dr Napthine says Melbourne ticked 'many of the right boxes' with sporting facilities, such as the MCG

'We would want to make sure that there is broad support across the world community and the Olympic community before you went and spent large amounts of money,' he said.

Dr Napthine said Melbourne already had most of the infrastructure in place, but given it had already hosted the Games in 1956, as did Sydney in 2000, other cities could be ahead of it in the queue.

The next Olympic Games will be held in Brazil's Rio de Janiero in 2016, following its hosting of the FIFA World Cup earlier this year in July.

But Dr Napthine says if Melbourne wanted to make a bid, a lot of work still had to be done
