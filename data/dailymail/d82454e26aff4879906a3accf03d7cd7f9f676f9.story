Sheffield United continued to pay Ched Evans after he was convicted of rape.

Football clubs can terminate a player’s contract, sacking them on the grounds of gross misconduct if they are found guilty of a criminal offence. 

But Sportsmail understands that officials at Bramall Lane honoured the remaining few months of Evans’ £20,000-per-week contract after he was imprisoned in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old girl.

Evans’ contract ran out at the end of June that year and the club announced he had been released with a number of other players that summer. 

But the Welsh international forward actually received his July salary too; something that a club is contractually obliged to do when releasing a player who has not, at that stage, found another club.

When asked on Thursday night why Sheffield United did not immediately respond to his rape conviction by sacking Evans, a spokesman for the League One club refused to comment.

Blades boss Nigel Clough says it is up to his employers to decide whether Evans can return to the club 

But the stance the club took over their former striker perhaps gives the best indication yet that they are prepared to welcome him back to Bramall Lane once he is released, as expected, from jail on Friday.

Publicly the club have not revealed their position on the future of Evans, insisting they have not yet made a decision. Earlier this week manager Nigel Clough said it was up to his employers to decide.

It is a situation that continues to divide opinion. While Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor insists Evans, now 25, should be allowed to return to work, Sheffield United came under yet more pressure to reject Evans on Thursday when deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, joined the debate.

In an interview with LBC Radio Mr Clegg, who is a Sheffield MP, said: ‘I think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days, you are also taking on a role model.

‘You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that, and he has committed a very serious crime.

‘It is for the football club to decide, but I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people.

‘I’m sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of Sheffield United. Rape is an incredibly serious offence, an unbelievably serious offence. 

'He has done his time but I just don’t believe that the owners of a football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened.’
