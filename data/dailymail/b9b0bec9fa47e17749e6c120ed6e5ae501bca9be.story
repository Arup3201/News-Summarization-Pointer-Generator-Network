News today that Jennifer Aniston cut her hair short because it was damaged by a Brazilian-style blowdry has not come as much surprise to industry experts.

The controversial treatment, which uses a combination of formaldehyde and keratin to keep locks straight for up to three months, is considered the answer to a frizzy-haired girl's prayers.

But top New York hairstylist Oscar Blandi, who counts Julianne Moore, Uma Thurman and the Olsen Twins among his clients, warns that one should proceed with caution if considering it.

Proceed with caution: Top hairstylist Oscar Blandi wouldn't recommend a Brazilian blowdry to a client who is constantly coloring her hair because the hair might not be strong enough to bear the intensity of the treatment

Cautionary tale: Jennifer Aniston was forced to cut her hair short (right) after damage from a Brazilian blowdry

'I think the treatment on its own is generally effective, but you have to make sure the condition of the hair is right for it,' he told MailOnline.

'I usually wouldn’t recommend it to a client who is constantly coloring her hair because the hair might not be strong enough to bear the intensity of the treatment. I think the key is testing a small part of the hair first, before doing the whole head.'

For celebrity make-up artist and hair 
stylist Rachel Wood, who works with Vanessa Hudgens, Rosario Dawson and Louise Roe, the Brazilian blowdry is more trouble than it is 
worth - indeed she was not impressed by her own experience of it.

The Brazilian blowdry began in Brazil in 2005 and usually uses a solution containing formaldehyde to straighten hair.

The treatment involves washing the hair with a special shampoo that opens up the hair cuticles in preparation for the straightening solution which is applied, combed through, then left on the hair for 30 minutes.

Next, straighteners are applied to ‘lock-in’ the formula and set the blowdry. Combining heat and formaldehyde prevents hair from curling, creating a long-term straightening effect.

But when heated, formaldehyde emits a vapor which can cause symptoms including difficulty breathing and nosebleeds. Formaldehyde has also been linked to a raised risk of cancer.

There is additional concern that if formaldehyde comes into direct contact with the scalp it can penetrate the hair follicle and permanently damage cells responsible for hair growth. The result would be that when hairs fall out, new ones will not grow in their place.

'Not
 all Brazilian treatments are created equal,' she said. 'Many have 
chemicals which can eventually damage hair so I'm not surprised Jens 
doing the chop.

'I personally have naturally bushy hair and had the treatment done one summer but I found it left my bouncy locks a little flat,' she admitted.

'I would have been better off just spending extra time using straighteners or just going with the curly flow of my natural texture.'

Ms Wood added that the maintenance was a frustrating extra expense too - especially given that the treatment itself can cost upwards of $300. Those with keratin-treated hair must invest in sulphate-free shampoo in order to maintain it.

'There are so many amazing hair products and tools on the market that I find this one beauty treatment that you can pass on,' she concluded.

Ms Aniston had her hair cut last week by Chris McMillan - her longtime hairstylist who gave her the 'Rachel' cut in the Nineties.

'It wasn’t for a role. My hair went through a phase,' she admitted to Elle UK. 'I did this thing called a Brazilian and my hair did not react really well to it.'

A study earlier this year from the University of California, Berkeley, found
 that formaldehyde concentrations in the air around hairstylists and 
customers exceeded limits set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
 Administration, the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and
 Health, and the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health.

It is recommended that hairdressers use 
products containing no more than 0.1 per cent formaldehyde, but researchers found that the popular Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Hair Solution contained 12per cent formaldehyde.

Study author Michelle Stewart said that 'without proper engineering controls like local exhaust ventilation [the product] could expose hairdressers and their clients to formaldehyde at levels above the short-term occupational exposure limits.'
