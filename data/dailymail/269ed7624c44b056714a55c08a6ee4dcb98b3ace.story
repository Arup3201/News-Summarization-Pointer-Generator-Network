Gareth Bale should stay at Real Madrid and forget about returning to the Premier League says his international manager Chris Coleman.

Bale's future has been the subject of much debate since Real fans began booing the world's most expensive player at the Bernabeu, while the Madrid media have accused him of being 'lazy' and a 'ball hog' in trying to shoot for goal rather than pass to colleagues.

Team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has also shown his displeasure over the Welshman's supposed selfishness and the Portuguese forward reacted petulantly when Bale scored last weekend - his double in a 2-0 win over Levante as he netted his first goals in 10 games.

Bale responded to his first goal by covering his ears with his hands - seen as a sign that he was not listening to the criticism - and kicking the corner flag, and it has led to fevered speculation that he could return home to the Barclays Premier League this summer.

Jose Mourinho's Chelsea have been linked with bringing the former Tottenham player back to London and it has been suggested that Manchester United could swap him for their Madrid-born goalkeeper David de Gea.

But Wales manager Coleman said: 'He should stay where he is.

'Chelsea are a huge club and have been successful as are Manchester United - but Real Madrid is Real Madrid.

'Gareth's good enough to win the big trophies, play on the big stage and play with the biggest club.

'It is different from Manchester United or Chelsea because while there is pressure on them to perform in every game, at Madrid it is almost like a show and there has to be entertainment.

'You have to be one of the best to play for them and, in my opinion, Gareth is good enough to win trophies and entertain at Real Madrid at the highest level.'

Despite Bale's difficult start to 2015, Coleman insists his talismanic forward is in good spirits ahead of Wales' table-topping Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel on Saturday week.

Surprise front-runners Israel have won their opening three matches but Wales are unbeaten after four games and have taken points off the top two seeds, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Belgium.

'I spoke to his agent three days ago, he is absolutely fine and there are no problems,' Coleman said.

'Baley is the most expensive player in the world and there is politics to all this.

'He's been caught up in a bit of a storm but, knowing Gareth as I do, I'd be really surprised if he said, 'I've had enough, I'm not accepting that and I'm coming home'.

'Everyone has good and bad periods and you just have to get through it and, saying that, he scored a couple of goals at the weekend.'

But Coleman admits that he has been taken aback by nature of the criticism aimed at the 25-year-old from Cardiff

'It's just not people venting their anger. some of the attacks have been quite personal,' Coleman said.

'You can't say Madrid have lost two or three games because of Gareth.

'That's not the truth, but he has been personally attacked.

'I don't know what the future will be for him, but all I can say is when he comes with us then it's not a problem.

'He works hard for us and fits into the system whether we play him down the middle or wide, as a nine or a 10.

'We may go to Haifa next week and he has a bad game, but he can still score us a goal that will win us the game out of nothing.

'The pressure is on but he has shown he can handle that in big games.

'He likes being in that environment where there is everything on it and he deserves to play in a major tournament.'
