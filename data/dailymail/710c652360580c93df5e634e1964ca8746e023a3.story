A teenage girl injured after she got trapped under an elevator at her Oklahoma school in November 2011 is claiming that she has been left disfigured and in need of continuing medical treatment by the incident.

Ambri Tygard, now aged 14, and her father have filed a lawsuit against Oklahoma City Public Schools seeking at least $100,000 in damages on a negligence claim.

She was one of three teenage girls, along with Liz Smith and Savanna Gable, who became trapped under an elevator at the Classen School for Advanced Studies, but is the only one to have filed a lawsuit in connection with the incident.

Oklahoma City attorney Thomas Steece, who is representing Tygard, wrote in the petition that his client ‘has suffered permanent, progressive and painful injuries’ due to the elevator incident.

Tygard ‘has suffered and will suffer physical and emotional pain and suffering ... as a result of the subject negligence,’ he wrote. She ‘has suffered disfigurement ... and will sustain loss of enjoyment of life as a result of injuries and damages sustained.’

Steece would not provide a description 
of his client's physical condition or say exactly how it is that she is 
disfigured. The case is pending in Oklahoma County District Court.

Since Tygard filed her lawsuit against the school district last June, it appears to have dramatically changed its stance over the issue, reports Newsok.com.

Ambri Tygard was one of three girls who got trapped under an elevator at an Oklahoma school in November 2011

At the time district Superintendent Karl
Springer admitted that the door to the older, lift-style elevator 
should've been locked. ‘It's not their fault,’ he said at the time.

Now the school district's attorney, Andy Fugitt, is denying nearly all of the allegations made by the girl's lawyers.

'Plaintiff's own negligence was the sole cause of her injuries,' Fugitt wrote. 'Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, and her comparative negligence is in sufficient percentage to reduce or bar any recovery herein.'

Despite the apparent contradiction, Fugitt told Newsok.com on Monday that the district's stance on the incident was unchanged.

'Superintendent Springer was speaking out of great concern for the students involved and based upon the information then available to him,' he said.

The three girls spent 40 minutes trapped underneath an elevator at Classen School of Advance Studies

Of the three girls trapped under the 
elevator, Tygard, a seventh-grader at the time, was the most seriously injured.

She suffered pressure on her lower body that left her legs numb and
stayed in the hospital for two days.

Speaking to ABC News’ Oklahoma City affiliate KOCO at time of the ordeal she said that she and her friends were on the first floor of their school when they decided to take the elevator.

'I didn’t think it was unsafe or 
anything. I just thought it was normal, until I looked up [and] 
realized, ‘This isn’t the elevator. This is the shaft room,''

But it was too late, her friend had already closed the door and they were locked inside.

Ambri said that within 30 seconds, the elevator that was three floors above, suddenly dropped, stopping just inches above them.

'I was like, "We’re going to die. We have to find a way out. There must be some way out,"' she said.

'I couldn't breathe because it was such a tiny space. My whole leg area was numb, I couldn't feel anything.'

The girls were rescued 40 minutes later and were taken to hospital on stretchers by paramedics.

Ambri credited her friend’s combat boots with saving their lives.

'[The elevator] came down right on her boot and stopped it,' she told KOCO.
