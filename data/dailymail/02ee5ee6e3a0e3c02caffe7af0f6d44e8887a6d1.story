Rafael Benitez is considering rescuing Fernando Torres again and taking him to Napoli, with AC Milan willing to let the on-loan striker leave in the January window.

Torres, 30, has scored just once in 11 games for AC Milan with his time at the Serie A club beginning to mimic his desperately poor start at Chelsea.

Benitez would need assurances from Torres that he was willing to be committed for the remaining months of the season and buckle down at Napoli.

Torres moved to Milan on a two-year loan deal after a frustrating spell at Stamford Bridge 

Napoli boss Rafael Benitez may bring Torres to the Stadio San Paolo on an initial six-month deal 

But Napoli need a back-up striker for Gonzalo Higuain and Torres will be available on a free transfer – despite having been worth £50m when he joined Chelsea almost four years ago.

Torres is on a two-year loan from Chelsea to AC Milan but is not expected back at Stamford Bridge and Milan have come to the conclusion that the striker is not going to fit in at the San Siro. Napoli would consider taking him for an initial six months.

Benitez signed Torres for £26m at Liverpool and was his manager during his golden period at the club, during which he scored 81 goals in 142 appearances.

He then managed him at Chelsea for six months in 2013, during which Torres produced some of his better form for the club, scoring 16 goals in 44 games, including the first in their victory in the Europa League Cup final win against Benfica.

Napoli are currently fifth in Serie A and are in the last 32 of the Europa League.

Benitez lured Torres away from Atletico Madrid to sign a £26m with Liverpool in 2007
