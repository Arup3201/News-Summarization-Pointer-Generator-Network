A woman murdered her two-year-old son after social services allowed unqualified workers and students to conduct key reviews into his safety.

A serious case review into two-year-old Keanu Williams’s death found authorities failed at ‘fundamental levels of care’, missing ‘horrifying’ cruelty.

Last night Peter Hay, the acting strategic director for children, young people and families at  Birmingham City Council, admitted the city’s children could still be at risk.

Brutal: Rebecca Shuttleworth was found guilty of murdering her two-year-old child Keanu Williams, who had more than 30 separate visible bruises and burns to his tiny body, yet was 'invisible' to the authorities

June 2010: Keanu taken to A&E with a cut above the left eye but Rebecca Shuttleworth’s explanation that it was an accident was accepted by hospital staff.

September 2010:  Shuttleworth takes son to hospital with head injuries claiming he fell onto a metal bench in the park. She also said Keanu had been kicked in the chest by a child on a swing. The doctor considered it to be non-accidental injury initially, and then, changed his mind it after consultation with the supervising registrar.

November 2010:  Keanu was seen at the A&E department at the hospital with a head injury, swelling and hair loss. Keanu was referred to a paediatrician due to concerns about frequent falls. Keanu was described as a ‘well cared for child’. A history of 'frequent falls' was noted. Keanu was discharged.

December 2010: Three days after the last incident Keanu was in hospital with bruising to his forehead, arms,back, feet, eyes and burns to the right foot.  According to Rebecca Shuttleworth it was a ‘hot radiator’ at her partner’s flat which had burnt Keanu’s foot while sleeping. The radiator and site was examined by a police officer and a social worker who found ‘there were no concerns’.

He said: ‘We can’t guarantee the safety of children because we don’t have enough staff.

'The position facing the city’s children remains frail.

‘We do not have enough social workers able to do enough great social work and that means  we are not able to adequately guarantee the standard of the safeguarding work.’

The little boy was found at the Birmingham home of his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth in January 2011 with 37 injuries, including a  fractured skull and a ‘fist-sized’ tear in his stomach.

He had been to A&E and his GP with signs of abuse – including head injury, hair loss, swelling and cuts – on at least 12 occasions.

Nursery staff were made aware of signs of neglect and abuse.

But agencies took his mother’s claims that they were simply bumps and bruises ‘at face value’.

Review author Jane Held said they were too often ‘unwilling to challenge’ or show ‘professional curiosity’.

She added: ‘No one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother’s needs rather than the child’s.’

At least three untrained workers – including a student who was on work placement – were put in charge of vital reviews of Keanu’s situation.

They included an assessment of Shuttleworth’s fitness to be a mother, carried out while she was pregnant in 2008 and living in Torbay, Devon.

The killer, who is serving a minimum term of 18 years for murder, told the review’s authors even she expected social services to take her child away.

A section on the 25-year-old’s background states: ‘She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born.’

Friends said she would leave Keanu with anyone she could find and left him in wet nappies for up to six hours.

Labour-run Birmingham City Council has been rated ‘inadequate’ since 2009 after deaths of children known to care workers, such as Khyra Ishaq, 7, who starved to death in 2008.

The new case echoes that of Coventry four-year-old Daniel Pelka, who was tortured to death by his mother despite warnings from care workers.

The report on Keanu’s death found agencies were guilty of a ‘loss of focus’ after an important assessment shortly before his first birthday.

It stated that: ‘Professionals in the  various agencies involved . . . did not meet the standards of basic good practice when they should have reported their concerns, shared and analysed information and followed established procedures.’

The 182-page report said Keanu’s death could not have been predicted, but agencies could have seen that he was ‘likely to suffer significant harm’.

Ten employees, including council staff, were sacked or have resigned  as a result, and a further five were subject to disciplinary hearings.

Catalogue of injuries: Rebecca Shuttleworth was convicted of murdering her two-year-old son after subjecting him to savage and sustained abuse, the injuries resulting from which where detailed at Birmingham Crown Court

Sustained abuse: Keanu was taken to hospital with burns and blisters on his foot, but his mother said it was from a radiator he slept near, which was accepted by police and health workers

Convicted: Shuttleworth's partner Luke Southerton was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter but convicted of child cruelty

Mr Hay, who is tasked with improving Birmingham children’s services, also said the city is ‘still a risky place for children’.

He said of the case: ‘We have failed to meet the basic expectation that our children are safe. For this we are unequivocally sorry.

‘We accept too that given our record in failing to improve children’s services, our apology may ring hollow.

‘We want today’s report to be a point of real change in children’s services.’

The Government has threatened further action unless it sees rapid improvements in care.

Edward Timpson, the minister for children and families, said: ‘This is an awful case and the serious case review shows that improvements are urgently needed.

'Birmingham’s problems are complex and we’re  taking action to secure properly embedded and sustained improvement to children’s social care.’

He added: ‘Special performance measures are in place and I have issued the council with a final warning – Ofsted will return to Birmingham this autumn to determine what progress has been made.’

The Government has threatened Birmingham's under-fire childcare agencies with further action unless it sees rapid improvements in services.

Commenting on the findings of the report into Keanu Williams's murder, Edward Timpson, the minister for children and families, said: 'This is an awful case and the serious case review (SCR) shows that improvements are urgently needed.'

Birmingham City Council's child safeguarding procedures, which were judged inadequate in June 2010, are due to be reviewed by Ofsted next month.

The city's children's services department was also served with an improvement notice by the Government in September 2010 after a serious of high-profile child deaths, including the starvation of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq in 2008.

Mr Timpson said: 'Birmingham's problems are complex and we're taking action to secure properly embedded and sustained improvement to children's social care.

'Special performance measures are in place and I have issued the council with a final warning - Ofsted will return to Birmingham this autumn to determine what progress has been made.

'There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow.

'The increasing number of SCRs being published nationally is beginning to give us a deeper and clearer understanding of what goes wrong, and why, when child protection services fail.'
