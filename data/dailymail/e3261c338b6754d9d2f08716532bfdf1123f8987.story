Former triathlon world champion Helen Jenkins has been ruled out of the Commonwealth Games through injury in a huge blow to Team Wales.

Wales had hoped triathlon might provide two medals with Jenkins and reigning world champion Non Stanford in line to compete in Glasgow but both have been forced out.

Stanford has not raced at all this season and her hopes of making the startline in Strathclyde Country Park next Thursday were ended in June when she sustained a stress fracture in her ankle as she tried to recover from a foot problem.

Tuesday's news is particularly cruel for Jenkins, the world champion in 2008 and 2011, after her hopes of Olympic gold in London were ruined by a knee injury.

She raced and finished fifth but did not compete again until earlier this season and even contemplated retirement before finally getting to the bottom of the knee problem.

Jenkins' comeback had been very encouraging, the 30-year-old finishing on the podium in the World Triathlon Series races in Cape Town, Chicago and Auckland to put her second in the world rankings.

But she pulled out of last Saturday's race in Hamburg during the run because of a foot problem.

The decision was described as precautionary but further tests have shown the injury is likely to end Jenkins' season.

She said: 'I'm obviously devastated. I was very proud to be selected to represent Wales and was looking forward to racing on a tough, honest triathlon course in Strathclyde.

'I will get more information from the specialist this week but with a grade two tear of my Plantar Fascia, it's almost certain that I won't be racing again this season.

'I particularly want to thank my support team who have worked so hard to get me back racing after such a difficult 18 months after the Olympics.'

The women's race had looked set to be a mouthwatering duel between Wales and England, who will be represented by world number three Jodie Stimpson, Vicky Holland and Lucy Hall.

The remaining Welsh triathletes are not medal contenders, and Brian Davies, chef de mission of Team Wales, said: 'It's undoubtedly a huge blow to the team and she'll be sorely missed but first and foremost our thoughts are with Helen.

'We wish her a speedy recovery and look forward to seeing her in action again in the near future.'

Stimpson will go into the race as the gold medal favourite with her main challenge now likely to come from Australia and New Zealand.
