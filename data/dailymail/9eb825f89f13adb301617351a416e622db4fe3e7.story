 A female police officer is being hailed as Britain’s shortest female copper - standing at just 5ft 1in tall.

PC Ellie Murphy, 21, spent two years volunteering as a special constable before joining the full-time force.

She graduated from Hendon Police College on January 17 and is now a Met Police officer - where one of her colleagues is 6ft 7in.

The minimum height requirement for police, which stood in place for years in the UK, has been scrapped.

Ellie Murphy and Martyn Evans are two of the Metropolitan Police's latest recruits. She is the smallest officer in the UK's largest force, towered over by fellow new officer Martyn Evans who is 18 inches taller.

Britain’s shortest copper is PC Robin Port, 29, of Devon and Cornwall Police, who stands at 5ft.

A spokesperson for the Met police said: 'PC Ellie Murphy is attached to Twickenham Borough, aged 21 - she is 5ft 1in tall.

'She joined the police after two years as a Special in Kingston.'

Martyn Evans is attached to Enfield Borough - he's 30 and 6ft 7 in tall.

In the past, male recruits had to be 
at least 5ft 10in and women 5ft 4in to join many forces. But from the 
early 1990s, height restrictions have gradually been removed.

Now, there are no British forces which still operate a minimum height requirement.

It has been made illegal to discriminate against - or reject - applicants on the basis of their height.

Police
 say the stringent assessment procedures used during recruitment of 
police officers tests many skills, including a physical ability to do 
the job.

It is the same 
across the Channel, where the country of Napoleon once imposed minimum 
height requirements for police centuries ago, raising them over the 
decades as the average size of Frenchmen rose.
