A teenager has died after falling from the window of a moving SUV following a night of drinking, friends have said.

Lelys Leyva-Monreal, 17, was returning home to Arlington, Texas after clubbing in Dallas with four other people when she climbed over her boyfriend and began hanging out of the window, police said.

Her friends desperately tried to pull her back inside the car, but she fell out and landed on the ground - before being hit by the vehicle at around 2.45am on Saturday, police said.

Tragic: Lelys Leyva-Monreal, 17, (pictured with her parents) was killed after falling from an SUV on Saturday morning. Her friends told police that they tried to pull her back inside but she fell anyway

'Based on initial interviews, it is believed that one of her friends tried unsuccessfully to pull her back inside,' police spokeswoman Tiara Richard said. 'But for an unknown reason she exited through the window while the car was still in motion.'

Three of her friends jumped from the car and tried to save her, while the 18-year-old driver fled - although she was later tracked down by police.

Levya-Monreal was rushed to Medical Center of Arlington but was pronounced dead shortly after.

'That was my little girl. She was going to do a lot of things and she was just 17,' the girl's crying mother, Levya, told WFAA.

Her devastated parents said that they have not heard from the driver or their daughter's boyfriend since the accident, but have spoken to two of the other passengers.

The friends said all of them were drinking and doing drugs before the tragedy, MyFoxDFW reported.

'Although it is still early in the investigation, alcohol is being investigated as a possible factor in this incident,' police spokesperson Tiara Richard said in a statement.

The 18-year-old driver has not been charged and is now cooperating with police. Authorities are also looking into the drug-use claims and who might have provided them.

On Saturday night, friends, and family gathered for a candlelight vigil near to where the accident happened.

Among the mourners was Levya-Monreal's mother, who said she wants to know more about the accident that claimed her daughter's life.

'There are a lot of versions of what happened that night. What I want to know is the truth,' she said.

Many of the girl's friends said they learned of her death from social media. Grief counselors are on hand at Arlington High School to help classmates cope with her death.
