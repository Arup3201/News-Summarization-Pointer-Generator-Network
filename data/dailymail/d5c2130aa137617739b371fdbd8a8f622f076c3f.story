Road to recovery: Matthew Parks, 13, works on core strengthening physical therapy for his Chance spinal fracture at Select Physical Therapy in Slidell, Louisiana

A 13-year-old boy from Louisiana is still in the process of recovering from his injuries nearly two months after he cracked his spine due to an improperly fastened seat belt.

In August, Matthew Parks, of Slidell, was on his way to church with his mother and two sisters when the vehicle they were riding in was involved in an accident.

Before the family hit the road, the teenager buckled up, but tucked the crossover shoulder strap of his seat belt under his arm.

His older sister, Katie, who was behind the wheel, got distracted and briefly lost control of the car, which ended up in a ditch. The impact of the collision sent Matthew’s upper body forward, causing his spine to snap and leaving him on the brink of paralysis, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported.

Luckily, the 13-year-old was able to regain his ability to walk and has spent the past two months attending physical therapy sessions to strengthen his core.

Besides rehabilitation, the 13-year-old has been busy playing catch-up in school after missing the first three weeks of his first year in junior high school.

Matthew Parks’ life changed on August 11, when the Slidell teen, his mother Terri, and sisters Jennifer and Katie piled into the family's 2010 Buick LaCrosse and headed to church.

Impact: Matthew snapped his spine in a car crash after tucking the crossover shoulder strap of his seat belt under his arm

Katie Parks was driving that Sunday with Matthew riding on the backseat. Although the boy has been taught by his parents to always wear a seat belt, Terri Parks sometimes would allow her kids to tuck the shoulder strap under their arms for comfort.

That is what Matthew did on that Sunday without giving it a second thought - a decision that nearly cost him his ability to walk.

When Katie Parks took her eyes off the road for a moment to change the song on her iPod, she lost control of the car and crashed it into a culvert in St Tammany Parish.

Because the boy's restraint was not properly secured, the impact of the crash caused his upper half to snap forward while his lower half remained secured by the lap belt.

Matthew was rushed to North Shore's Ochser Medical Center, where a CT scan revealed that the teen suffered what is known as a Chance fracture - a break that went through the middle of his back, injuring his liver, spleen, pancreas and kidneys.

Major trauma: Chance fracture was first described in 1948 by British radiologist G.Q. Chance as a flexion injury of the spine

‘The doctors compared the fracture in his back to cutting a loaf of bread in half - a clean break,’ Mrs Parks told the newspaper.

The traumatic spinal fracture is named after G.Q. Chance, a British radiologist who was the first to describe this type of lumbar injury in 1948.

After three days of medical treatments, doctors were able to perform a surgery to mend Matthew's Chance fracture by inserting a rod and four screws in his back to stabilize the spine.   

Matthew is now able to walk, but has to wear a body brace and attend regular physical therapy sessions to strengthen his back muscles.

Although he is allowed to do some physical activities, he still cannot run or perform simple everyday tasks like tie his own shoes.

Since the accident, Teri Parks has been on a mission to share her son's story in order to raise awareness of seat belt safety.

‘I truly hope it encourages everyone not to wear their seat belt like that and to keep an eye on their kids when they buckle up, too,’ Parks said.
