The popular blogger behind Instagram handle The Blonde Vegan has opened up about how her obsession with following a plant-based diet has led to a dangerous eating disorder.

After launching her Instagram account in June 2013, New Yorker Jordan Younger, now 23, quickly amassed 70,000 followers who turned to her for inspiration, recipes and diet advice.

But a year later, after she stopped getting her period and began constantly feeling lethargic, Jordan realized her passion for veganism and healthy eating had turned into an unhealthy obsession.

Dangerous habits: Jordan Younger, the popular blogger behind Instagram handle The Blonde Vegan, has opened up about how her obsession with following a plant-based diet led to a dangerous eating disorder

'Food was not enjoyable anymore,' 5ft 4in Jordan, who weighed just 105lbs at her lowest point, told People.

'I was spending the entire day obsessing about eating 
only vegetables, green juices, fruits and occasionally nuts and grains,' she added. 'I was following thousands of rules in my head that were making me sick.'

Jordan was suffering from what doctors call 'orthorexia' - a 'fixation on righteous eating' which causes people to 'become consumed with what and how much to eat, and how to deal with "slip-ups,"' according to the National Eating Disorders Association.

While she 
says that Instagram isn't wholly to blame, Jordan acknowledges that she 
might have come to terms with her problem more easily if it weren't for her 
internet presence as a vegan.

Restrictive eating: But her passion soon became an unhealthy obsession. 'I was spending the entire day obsessing,' she said. 'I was following thousands of rules in my head that were making me sick'

'My blog 
made it hard for me to see that I had an eating disorder,' she said. 'If I wasn't so
 closely tied to the vegan identity I'd given myself, I would have 
realized it a lot sooner.'

She added: 'I think labels - as far as diet choices - are very, very dangerous. I'm a prime example of that.'

As it was, it took bad skin, low energy levels and the loss of her period for Jordan to finally seek advice.

And after speaking to a friend who was recovering from an eating disorder, she saw too many similarities to ignore.

Label: 'My blog made it hard for me to see that I had an eating disorder,' she said. 'If I wasn't so closely tied to the vegan identity I'd given myself, I would have realized it a lot sooner'

Red flags: She suffered low energy, bad skin and vitamin and protein deficiency. What's more, she stopped having her period for several months

Jordan's fears that her strict vegan lifestyle may have done more harm than good were confirmed when she decided to try eating a wild salmon - her first taste of fish in a year and a half.

Two days later, her period returned - sure sign that the fish had been what her body needed.

So on June 23 of this year, Jordan posted a blog entry called Why I Am Transitioning Away From Veganism, explaining to her fans that she had become deficient in vitamins and protein, and would have to start eating eggs and fish to get her hormones back in balance.

She explained that she did not blame veganism for the disordered eating habits she developed, writing: 'Those who read this blog know that I have a very extreme personality, and the combination of my personality with the restriction of an entirely plant-based diet pushed me over the edge.'

New lifestyle: 'Plants are amazing!' wrote Jordon, who now goes by 'The Balanced Blonde'. 'But that's not ALL that is out there. Some of us need more... especially those of us with extreme "all or nothing" personalities'

Despite her honest approach, Jordan lost thousands of 'hardcore vegan' followers and even received death threats for changing her dietary ways.

'If I wasn't so closely tied to the vegan identity, I would have realized a lot sooner that I had an eating disorder'

Nevertheless, she decided to continue posting under the new username 'The Balanced Blonde'.

'Plants are amazing!' she wrote. 'Vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts and legumes are beautiful foods from the earth and should be incorporated into as many meals as possible throughout the day.

'But that's not ALL that is out there. Some of us need more in order to fuel or bodies properly - especially those of us with extreme "all or nothing" personalities like my own.'
