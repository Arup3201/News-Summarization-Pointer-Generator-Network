It's a new $25.9 million bridge that only opened in November - and to a thrill-seeking BMX stunt rider like Mat Olson, it was just begging to be 'christened'.

Cycling straight past the bike lane, the death-defying 25-year-old - who has knocked out his front teeth and their replacements seven times - managed to traverse the 24-foot tall arches of the Seventh Street bridge in the Textas city of Fort Worth on Saturday.

Shocked passers-by were stopped in their tracks by the sight of the professional rolling up and down the giant beams, while drivers continued along their journeys below, most of them oblivious to the action happening overhead.

'It seemed like I was on top of a mountain,' Olson told The Star Telegram.

Almost there: Mat Olson, 25, conquers the fouth of five arches of the Seventh Street bridge during a stunt on Saturday

This is the hard part: Mat Olson said the most difficult section of the stunt was pedaling up the arches, because if she started shaking he could fall

That's a wrap: Mat Olson exits the final arch of the Seventh Street as his friends on the ground cheer. The stunt was incident-free

'It was all windy and crazy when I was up there.

'It was pretty exhilarating, that’s for sure.'

The stunt was also illegal.

A police car patrolling the area pulled up when they noticed the groups of people that had congregated to watch the crazy ride unfold.

'By the time they got out of their cars, I was already halfway across (the bridge)' Olson said.

'They were more astonished than anything: ‘'I can’t believe you’re alive right now. Are you kidding? Why are you doing this?''.'

Olson had spoken with an attorney before the stunt to research any possible legal ramifications.

The cops ran his ran, questioned his motives and listed the citations they could have charged him with, such as criminal trespassing, improper use of a vehicle and destruction property.

Woops: Mat Olson has knocked out his front - and their replacements - seven times. He has also suffered 13 concussions, had three knee surgeries and ruptured his spleen

However in the end they let him off with a warning.

'I think I kind of smoothed them over,' Olson said.

'They said: '‘To be honest, we’re glad you’re alive. We don’t want to see that on our watch. Tell your friends we’ll be watching out for this and we won’t be lenient the next time.'' '

 Olson, who splits his time between Arizona and Fort Worth and dreams of competing in The X Games, has entertained crowds at Dallas Mavericks halftime shows and the State Fair of Texas.

He had planned to do the stunt ever since the bridge started construction.

'You can turn anything into an obstacle with a little bit of an imagination,' Olson said.

Right before the ride, his helpers placed support planks Olson had made from plywood and 2-by-4s over the meeting points of the bridge’s six north-side arches.

Mat Olson, 25, hired a film crew and consulted with a lawyer before doing the stunt

The south-side arches couldn’t be used because modifications had already been completed to prevent such access, perhaps because skateboarders and pedestrians tried to scale or ride down portions of the bridge, Olson said.

Olson's wild lifestyle comes riddled with injuries.

He’s suffered 13 concussions, had three knee surgeries, a ruptured spleen and had his front teeth - and their replacements - knocked out seven times.
