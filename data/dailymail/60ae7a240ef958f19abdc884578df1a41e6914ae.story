A compensation payout should cover future medical costs and living expenses, not go towards paying for four TV sets, a pool table, a ride-on mower, a gaming machine, model cars, and fishing gear.

This never dawned on a Canberra man who was awarded more than $1 million in worker's compensation and spent almost all of it on these luxury items in just four months. But now after blowing the cash he wants welfare too.

9 News' A Current Affair programme told the tale of Jason Cooper a former tiler who was placed on a Disability Support Pension and eventually awarded damages totalling $1,025,000.

An elaborate gaming machine is one of the luxury gifts Jason Cooper bought himself

The Canberra man bought a beachfront house near Bateman's Bay on the NSW south coast for $410,000

It all began at an NRL footy match in 2006, where the Canberra Raiders were leading the Brisbane Broncos 14-6 at the break. But things took a turn for the worse at Canberra Stadium during a half-time promotional competition.

Mr Cooper was one of a few spectators chosen to take part in a competition where they had to catch a ball in a milk crate to win a prize, however he received spinal injuries during the event that he said prevented him from ever working again.

He received a payout of $1.025 million. After receiving his payout, Mr Cooper bought a three bedroom house near Bateman's Bay on the NSW south coast worth more than $400,000.

A large selection of classic model cars was another expense that Mr Cooper splashed out on

Centrelink said he could not access welfare until late 2017 because of his huge payout 

The main problem was that he blew the rest in four months on a variety of personal items, and now believes he's now entitled to welfare.

 A Current Affair confronted Mr Cooper about his purchases, and he denied any wrongdoing. 

'"So I bought a house for $410,000. You want me to go spend it on alcohol or drugs or gamble it away?' he told the interviewer. 'A bloke got $3 million, mate, and blew it all away.'

As well as substantial legal fees that were taken out of his payment he also blames his financial mismanagement on not being able to access internet banking to monitor his spending.

After receiving his massive payout Centrelink said he could not access welfare until late 2017, but Mr Cooper wanted it now because he had run out of money.

He went to the administrative appeals tribunal to have the ruling overturned but they told him his purchases were ‘unwise, irresponsible and unnecessary decisions’.

Lawyer Sam Macedoni told A Current Affair that Mr Cooper failed to structure his compensation payout to provide for his future needs.

'Some of it is for medical expenses, some of it is for income you won't be able to earn and some for other reasons, so you just can't go and blow it,' Mr Macedoni said.

A Current Affair's grilling of Mr Cooper took a comedic turn when the camera man was nearly run over by a car as he followed Mr Cooper across the road.  

Mr Cooper was placed on a Disability Support Pension and eventually awarded damages totalling $1,025,000

Mr Cooper made it very clear to A Current Affair that he was hard done by because he could not receive any welfare

'Come on mate you missed out on that. I was hoping you’d get run over,’ chirped Mr Cooper. 

To which the interviewer responded: ‘Jeez, it might be another payout.'

‘Not for me – for you! … If you don’t f****** watch where you’re going!’ shouted back Mr Cooper.

The Canberra Raiders have since stopped all half-time entertainment involving crowd participation.
