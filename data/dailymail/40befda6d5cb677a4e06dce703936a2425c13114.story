A serial burglar who stole money a mother-of-two had been saving for a holiday has avoided prison weeks after vigilantes who kidnapped him in a bid to retrieve the cash were jailed.

Michael Price-Rutherford took £280 from Kelly Hilton, 32, who had saved the cash for a trip to Lanzarote when he broke into her home in Blackburn, Lancashire.

A short time later, the 22-year-old was then bundled into a van by her boyfriend and another man, punched in the face and humiliated in an act of revenge.

He was eventually dumped half naked and crying in the road nursing a chipped tooth after being held prisoner by Daniel Finn, 27, and Daniel Howarth, 23, for five hours.

The two men were jailed for a total of five years in March after a judge said they had 'crossed the law'.

However Price-Rutherford escaped with a suspended sentence, despite having 12 convictions to his name, claiming he was a 'shy un-forceful character'.

Preston Crown Court in Lancashire heard he had been on bail for another break in at the time, and had ignored previous curfew orders.

But the defence said he was 'put up to the crime' by other people, and only acted as a look out.

After the sentencing Miss 
Hilton, a golf club waitress said: 'I can’t believe this lad has escaped
 jail after what he did. I’m just shocked and upset.

'I
 was due to go to Lanzarote with my parents, Danny and family and had 
been saving up for months.

'The tin was hidden behind my bed and I was 
also collecting coins for the trip. All of it went in the raid.

Vigilantes: In March, Daniel Finn, 27, and Daniel Howarth, 23, were jailed for a total of five years following the act of revenge where they bundled Price-Rutherford in the back of a van, stripped him naked and punched him

'I know Danny did wrong and he got a really tough judge on the day - but I don’t understand why the burglar should go free.

'I
 thought he’d be going down especially with his track record. I don’t 
think this will be the last time the courts will be seeing him again. 
He’s got away with it.'

The
 incident occurred last June last year when Price-Rutherford and an 
accomplice Timothy Hartley, 29, were seen breaking into the house by a 
neighbour who took pictures on her mobile phone.

Hartley was seen climbing between a gate and up to a window where he forced it open with a hammer.

Price-Rutherford
 acted as a look out and was handed a tin from an upstairs bedroom where
 up to £250 was kept. The burglars also snatched a bottle containing £30
 in change.

That evening, Miss Hilton returned home from work to be met by the 
neighbour who warned her she had been burgled and showed her the 
pictures.

Miss Hilton felt so 'violated' by the raid she was afraid to bring her two children home as she didn’t feel safe.

Both burglars were identified in the photos and shortly afterwards Finn, her boyfriend, turned up at a house where Price-Rutherford was staying.

He grabbed him by the right arm and pulled him towards the side door of the van demanding the return of the stolen money.

The
 thief tried to resist, but Howarth appeared and took hold of the 
burglar’s other arm and both men forced him into the van. Finn then 
turned to the victim and punched him in the face chipping his tooth.

The vehicle then set off, but when 
the men realised Price-Rutherford could not tell them where the stolen 
money was, he was punched another seven or eight times.

The
 shutters were pulled down and the van was driven around for another 
five hours and when he was eventually ejected from the van.

The
 men had a pit bull type dog with them and Price-Rutherford was made 
to made to take off his jacket, t-shirt, socks and shoes before being 
kicked to the ground.

Price-Rutherford was eventually let go and staggered to a nearby a house where he raised the alarm. In a victim impact statement he said: 'Throughout this time I was so scared I started crying. I honestly thought they were going to kill me.'

He was arrested over the burglary but whilst he accepted being present he initially denied keeping watch.

On March 28, Howarth, of Blackburn, 
was jailed for 44 months whilst Finn, from Blackpool, got 27 months 
after they admitted kidnap.

At the time Judge Graham Knowles QC told them: 'You decided to punish this man for what you were convinced he had done.

'Your
 message was "cross us and you will pay the price". If the courts were 
to allow that kind of message without severe punishment, the result 
would be anarchy. If you cross the law, you must pay the price.'

At
 Price-Rutherford’s hearing on Thursday no mention was made of the 
vigilante attack. He admitted two charges of burglary and was sentenced 
to 12 months in prison suspended for 18 months with an 18 month 
supervision order.

His lawyer David Farley said Price-Rutherford’s father had been diagnosed with cancer.

He said: 'That’s encouraged and proved his attitude to his own life. His antecedents started in 2012 borne out of the fact he didn’t have a fixed address.

'He would drift around with his friends motivated to commit offences. He was with people who he didn’t have the strength to stand up to or walk away.

'He was put up by people determined to commit crime. He wouldn’t mind me describing him as a shy un-forceful character.'

Sentencing Price-Rutherford, the judge Mr Recorder Michael Blakey told him the burglary was 'serious' but added: 'If Mr Farley is right and you recognise you are going down the right road it is all well and good.'

Hartley of Blackburn, Lancashire, was given a suspended sentence of 18 months in prison suspended for two years - despite having a record of 30 offences including 16 for theft as well as shoplifting, drug handling and burglary.
