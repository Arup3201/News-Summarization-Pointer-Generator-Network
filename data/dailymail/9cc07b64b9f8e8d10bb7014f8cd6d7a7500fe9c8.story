Thieves are cashing in on the devastating floods by stealing warning signs to sell for scrap metal, it has been claimed.

The theft of the signs in the past month has led to dozens of motorists driving into flooded areas unaware and getting stuck in their cars after their engines conked out.

One car which may have been a victim was a £60,000 Audi which was stripped bare by thieves after the driver abandoned it after driving into floodwater in Chertsey, Surrey, last month.

Council chiefs in Surrey said the 600 signs - stolen from all over the county, but particularly in Spelthorne and Runnymede - would cost £23,000 to replace.

Local Grant Garvey, 36, said: 'Whoever is taking the signs should know they are the worst kind of thieves.

'They are removing important safety signs to sell on for just a few quid in scrap metal - they have no thought at all for other people.'

A Surrey County Council spokesman said: 
'We have been appalled during the flooding by the theft of warning 
signs, which are there for the safety of our residents and motorists.

Vanished: All of the car's plush fittings have been taken and its remains have been left to rust on the roadside

'In Spelthorne and Runnymede, about 600 signs have disappeared at a total cost to our contractor of about £23,000.

'This theft is a cynical and dangerous act at a time when many people are in difficult and distressing circumstances.'

In the flood-stricken Somerset Levels meanwhile, three more alleged fuel thieves have been arrested.

Police stopped the trio at 4am today near the flooded village Muchelney and found drums and an electric pump in their 4x4.

The men, aged 51, 35 and 24, are now being held at Yeovil police station.

Two fire service quad bikes were also taken from Burrowbridge on the same night.

Avon and Somerset Police said: 'We arrested three men overnight on suspicion of going equipped to steal fuel on the Somerset Levels.

'Officers stopped their 4x4 vehicle, containing large drums and an electric pump, at 4am in Kingsdown, just to the east of the flooded village of Muchelney.'
