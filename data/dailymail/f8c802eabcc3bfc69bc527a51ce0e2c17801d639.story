A referee has been charged after FA computers were allegedly hacked.

Dean Mohareb has been charged with perverting the course of justice and unauthorised access to computer data.

Mohareb, a senior member of the Football Association’s referee department and a football league official, was due to take charge of Barnsley against Peterborough on Tuesday night.

But the 29-year-old was stood down from the match following his arrest at home on Sunday.

Mohareb was first arrested over allegations that he hacked into a colleague's email account in October last year.

Police seized a number of electrical items from his home on that occasion.

Mohareb was suspended by the FA in February. It is understood that the other two men are not FA employees.

The FA has declined to comment on the matter while legal proceedings are going on.

Liam Cliff, 18, of Manchester, and Vincent Rossi, 46, of Wilmslow have been charged with perverting the course of justice.

They will appear at Stockport Magistrates' Court on December 5, Greater Manchester Police said.

A statement from Greater Manchester Police said: ‘On Sunday 30 September 2012 police seized a number of electrical items as part of an investigation into computer hacking and the dissemination of private information.

‘A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of unauthorised access to computer material/data, under section 1 of the Misuse of Computers Act 1990.

'The man has since been bailed until 26 November 2012.’
