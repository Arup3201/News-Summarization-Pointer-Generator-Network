Charged: Teacher Megan Connors is charged with having sex with a student, 15, during school hours

A 30-year-old math teacher employed at a middle school in Plant, City Florida is accused of having sex with one of her 15-year-old students on numerous occasions.

Megan Connors, 30, had sex 'multiple times' with her 15-year-old pupil at Turkey Creek Middle School, says the Hillsborough County Sheriff's office.

Connors is charged with sexual battery along with lewd and lascivious battery and lewd conduct, reports The Tampa Tribune.

Police say that Connors began an inappropriate relationship with the boy in January that began with kissing and later led to fondling.

As the relationship progressed Connors and her student allegedly began having sex during school hours in classrooms.

Connors is said to have used administrative powers to have the boy removed from his classes so that the two could rendezvous.

Police say that Connors once drove the student from the school to his house where they had sex in his bedroom.

An investigation is ongoing and as of now no other students are believed to be involved.

Connors, who began working at the school in August, was removed from her classroom about a week ago after the school suspected she might be having sexual relations with a student half her age.

Connors will be fired from her school and may also lose her teaching certificate.

'We are disappointed. We have so many teachers who are doing a great job. This teacher had nothing in her background that indicated any problems. It's shocking and disappointing,' said the school in a statement on Friday night.
