TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has sparked outrage after claiming eating puppy meat is no worse than eating a pork chop.

The River Cottage star, who regards himself as a ‘real food campaigner’, suggested that society has unfairly dictated which animals can be farmed and which can be kept as pets.

His comments were criticised by animal charities as ‘wholly unacceptable’.

'Gimmicky'? The TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall - star of River Cottage - admitted he would only eat cats and dogs if he was 'on the point of starvation'

Fearnley-Whittingstall told the Radio Times: ‘In principle, but not in practice, I have no objection to a high-welfare organic puppy farm.

‘You can’t object, unless you also object to the farming of pigs.

‘It’s an artificial construct of our society, a cultural decision, to make pets out of dogs and meat out of pigs.

‘Both animals could be used the other way round – although pigs probably do make better meat than dogs and dogs better pets than pigs. But it’s not a foregone conclusion.’

However, the 46-year-old did admit he would only eat loin of labrador or cat liver if ‘I was on the point of starvation’.

Last night a Dogs Trust spokesman said: ‘We believe that the concept of breeding dogs for food in any conditions, high welfare or not, is wholly unacceptable.

‘Dogs are companion animals and as man’s best friend they provide immeasurable love, comfort and support to owners all over the world.

‘They have an innate ability to form real bonds with humans and their loyalty is unquestionable.

‘They also contribute so much to society through their vital roles with our armed forces and the police, and they help people in need such as those who are sight and hearing impaired or otherwise disabled.’

An RSPCA spokesman said the chef’s comments ‘were made in a crude way’, adding: ‘Our concerns are with the farming of any animal, dog or otherwise, and his comments may seem sensible but are actually quite controversial – especially when dogs are our most popular and loved pet.’

Fearnley-Whittingstall has spent the past five months not eating meat for his latest TV series and for a vegetarian cookbook.

When asked if his new-found vegetarianism was a gimmick for the £1.9million publishing deal, he said: ‘That money is for a series of eight or nine River Cottage handbooks, which I don’t write so the money is shared. But I don’t think we’re gimmicky.

‘I started by looking at where food came from, rearing our animals and growing our food.’

It is not the first time Fearnley-Whittingstall  has caused controversy over his food ideas. He has eaten curried fruit bat, giraffe and calf testicles in the past.

In 1998 he fell foul of broadcasting rules when his show TV Dinners saw people cooking and eating human placenta.

He said at the time: ‘People need to be shocked to make them think about the issues in eating food.’
