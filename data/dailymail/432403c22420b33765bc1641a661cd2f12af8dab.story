The body of a man who had been missing for a week has been found stuffed in an esky at a bloody bushland crime scene in far north Queensland.

David Leslie Hickson, 32, was charged with murder and interference with a corpse after police discovered the large esky in bushland at Edmonton, just outside of Cairns, on Thursday.

The victim, whose identity has not yet been released, had not been reported missing but police went looking for him seven days ago following a tip-off from the public, the Cairns Post reports.

'We believed there were some suspicious circumstances around the potential this guy might be missing and we've launched it from there,' Det Insp Bruno Asnicar said.

'It really started as something really minor.'

The pair were known to each other and often associated together in Cairns, even though the victim is believed to have only recently moved there. 

Police have established a crime scene around the bushland and are searching a single-storey house on Lord Close in Edmonton where they believe the alleged killing took place.

They are still investigating the man's cause of death and when he may have been killed. 

Mr Hickson appeared at Cairns Magistrates Court to face the charges on Thursday.

The court heard there was a warrant out for his arrest following a failure to sign a bail document during a previous court appearance on an unrelated matter.

He was remanded in custody and is due to reappear on December 17.
