It's a crucial question in the Lord Lucan saga that has remained  unanswered for nearly 40 years: What caused the murderous rage that led him to kill the family nanny, batter his pretty young wife and then flee, never to return?

Now dramatic new evidence can be revealed that throws fresh light on what may have driven Lucan   into such a violent fury before he killed Sandra Rivett with a lead  pipe and left Lady Lucan with serious head wounds.

It comes in a remarkable testimony from former croupier Barri Hitchin, who claims to be one of the last people to have seen Lucan before he vanished, and who has finally broken his silence on the tragic events of November 7, 1974.

Croupier Barri Hitchin tells how peer gambled away equivalent of £50K in an hour

Mr Hitchin said he watched in astonishment that night at the  Ladbroke Club in Mayfair as so-called Lucky Lucan, a notorious gambler, lost £8,000  – roughly equivalent to £50,000 today – in just over an hour playing blackjack, before exploding with rage and attempting to overturn the card table.

The game started at 7.40pm and Lucan left in a fury at 8.50pm – ten minutes before detectives believe  29-year-old Mrs Rivett was killed at Lucan’s Belgravia home, an eight-minute drive away.

Mr Hitchin added: ‘When the papers came out with the story of the nanny’s murder, I did wonder whether it was us that tipped him over the edge.’

Mr Hitchin, 61, who now lives in the West Country, had been working at the Ladbroke Club after qualifying as a croupier and was making ends meet while he saved up for  acting school. He recalled how he first set eyes on Lucan, wearing full evening dress, at 7.40pm on the night of the murder.

He said: ‘I am very sure of his arrival time because I had just begun my 7.30pm break. I was ten minutes into it when I was asked to come down and set up a private blackjack table. Lucan came to the table with four £1,000 blue plaques which I would exchange for £25 chips as and when he required.

‘I took that £4,000 off him pretty quickly, maybe 30 to 35 minutes.’

Mr Hitchin remembered Lucan going to the cash desk and returning with another £4,000. ‘This time, I took the money off him even quicker – inside 25 minutes. At the end, he was down to his last £25 chip.

‘He looked at me, waiting for the deal. I politely reminded him of the terms of the game – minimum two hands; minimum £25 stake on each. His face went white, he became extremely aggressive and he barked at me, “Listen boy, when I tell you to deal, you deal.” I dealt the hand and Lord Lucan lost again.

‘In that moment, he exploded with rage. He clenched his fists and brought them down with a huge bang on the table. His face was contorted; he was absolutely furious.

‘My entire year’s salary was £4,000 and he had lost twice that inside an hour. He tried to tip the blackjack table over and David [a casino supervisor] and I threw ourselves on top of it to stop him.  He stormed out and that was the last we saw of him.’

Mr Hitchin said he never told his story at the time out of a sense of loyalty to his employers at the casino, and also because he feared his account would never be believed in the face of what he insists was an Establishment cover-up. He eventually gave a statement to a Metropolitan Police officer by telephone earlier this year, following claims that Lucan was living secretly in Africa.

After the nanny was killed and Lady Lucan attacked, Lucan fled in a Ford Corsair borrowed from one of his gambling friends. It was found abandoned at Newhaven on the  Sussex coast. There were bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping, wrapped in bandages, in the boot. It matched a similar weapon found at the murder scene.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police would not discuss Mr  Hitchin’s statement but added: ‘The inquiry has never been closed. Any significant new information will  be considered.’

The Ladbroke Club enjoyed a short but chequered history. In 1979, it was mired in scandal over how it lured well-heeled new customers.  Profits soared after the club paid a network of private eyes to note the number plates of expensive cars arriving at rival casinos and a corrupt policeman was allegedly paid to supply the owners’ addresses.

They were then targeted with flowers and champagne, and hostesses would call them with offers of free dinners. Licensing magistrates closed the place down. The Hill Street building is now offices but lies empty pending refurbishment.
