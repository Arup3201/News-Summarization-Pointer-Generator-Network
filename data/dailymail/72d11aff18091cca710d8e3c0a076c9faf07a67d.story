Victim: Catherine Wynter was stabbed to death

A teenage babysitter was stabbed to death while looking after her three-year-old nephew and four-year-old niece on  Boxing Day.

Catherine Wynter, 19, was knifed multiple times at her sister’s house where she was staying overnight with the two children.

She was found dead in a pool of blood
the next morning by her distraught mother when she came to pick up her 
grandchildren at 8am.

The children were found in the house with the body. Neither of the terrified toddlers had been harmed.

Yesterday police were interviewing the children to find out whether they witnessed the brutal murder.

Miss Wynter was last heard from at 7.30pm on Boxing Day when she made a last phone call.

Neighbours told how they heard 
screams coming from the £200,000 terraced home in Borehamwood, 
Hertfordshire, late at night. But no one raised the alarm.

Police believe the art student was 
attacked by someone who knew her. 

Detectives were today given a further 26 hours to question an 18-year-old man from Borehamwood over the murder.

They also arrested a 26-year-old man from Islington, North London, but he was later released.

Both suspects were known to Miss Wynter, but they were not direct relatives, police said.

Yesterday her distraught family paid 
tribute to the ‘loving auntie’, who regularly babysat the children as a 
favour to her sister who worked long hours on night shifts.

In a statement, they paid tribute to 
the talented artist, who was known as Katie, saying: ‘Katie was a quiet 
girl who enjoyed life. She was a loving auntie to her niece and nephew.’

Friends of the teenager laid flowers 
in the street where she was killed, just a short distance from her 
family home in Borehamwood.

Tragedy: Catherine Wynter was found stabbed to death at her sister's house in Beech Drive, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, by her mother on Tuesday morning

Family friend Doreen Foster, 76, described her as a ‘ray of sunshine’ who had a ‘wicked sense of humour’.

Mrs Foster said: ‘She was always happy. I never saw her sad or upset.

‘She was a lovely girl. She had a bubbly personality and was never in a bad mood.’

Miss Wynter, who was due to graduate 
from an art course at West Hertfordshire College in Watford next summer,
spent most of her time with three friends.

They were known as the ‘four musketeers’ because they were inseparable.

The four were due to travel to London next month to visit the Dr Who exhibition.

Yesterday the mother of her best friend Aimee said her daughter was ‘in bits’.

Sarah Foster said: ‘I got home last 
night and my daughter was in floods of tears. The emotion is still raw. 
She has been up all night crying.

‘No one can believe what has 
happened. I keep expecting Katie to walk down the road saying: “It’s 
me”. It is hard to think that your daughter’s best friend of 16 years is
not going to be walking through the door.

‘It is hard for all three girls. They are never going to be able to phone her again.’ 
Aimee wrote on Facebook: ‘My life will never be the same without you – the best 16 years friendship ever.’

Friends from Queens’ School in Bushey, Hertfordshire posted dozens of messages on Facebook and Twitter.

Tributes: Friends and neighbours started leaving flowers with police officers at the scene of the stabbing

Yesterday specially-trained officers 
from Hertfordshire Police began the difficult process of interviewing 
the traumatised children who could prove to be key witnesses.

Detective Superintendent Mick Hanlon 
appealed for witnesses, saying: ‘We have a team of detectives currently 
working on the case who are looking at a number of lines of inquiry to 
establish exactly what happened.

‘However I would like to appeal to the communities of Borehamwood to help us.’

Gathering evidence: Police closed part of Beech Drive to preserve the scene from potential contamination
