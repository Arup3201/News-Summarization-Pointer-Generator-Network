By the end of her life, there was a chasm between me and my adored mother that was really rather sad. We visited each other’s worlds, bewildered tourists both, before scuttling back to what each believed to be the ‘sanity’ of her own.

And no wonder. For worlds apart is what we were. My mother was clever, no doubt about it; at 14 she won a scholarship for a further education that her family could neither afford her to take nor imagine to be useful.

So she worked - courageously, too: as operator of the Swansea air raid sirens, she could not take shelter as the bombs rained down. But she stopped work altogether when she married, kept kith and kin together and dallied with women of similarly mundane lives over coffee mornings and afternoon teas.

Rings true: Carol can identify with the points made in the book The XX Factor

For me, just one generation later, further education was a birthright. Nobody was surprised that my sister and I went to university in the Seventies, then into law and the media respectively.

Which places us, we now learn, in a history-making elite: the XX women.

The title comes from a groundbreaking new book by Alison Wolf, The XX Factor — How Working Women Are Creating A New Society, in which she describes this elite as the 15 per cent of women who are graduate professionals, high achievers and top earners; the women who live to work against the 85 per cent who work to live, if they work at all.

And these ‘alpha women’ are finding more in common with men like themselves than with less accomplished members of their own sex — thus creating a yawning gap between two different classes of women.

To which I can only say to Alison Wolf: what took you so long?

More than a mother: Carol is proud to be a grandmother to Milly, pictured, but she doesn't let these roles define her

At last, somebody has noticed what I have felt all along: that there are easily 85  per cent of women in this country with whom I have nothing in common — and I count my mother among them.

This book explains what I have always known — that, to women like me, most other women’s lives and conversational topics are dreary, cliched and uninteresting.

Even as a teenager, I never understood the bonding girl thing. The sleepovers, where you spent the evening painting each other’s toenails in somebody’s (usually pink) bedroom.

So instead, I hung around with boys who would become alpha men. Together we smoked and argued about Vietnam.

When the boys became young men, I still sought their company. Not because I wanted to be a man, but because I wanted what men had. And, by and large, I got it.

Time in male company taught me that my intellect and abilities were as good as theirs. So it figured that if I put in the hours that they did, I was entitled to the same rewards.

And if others were too stupid or too idle, well, lock them in their pink bedrooms.

'For us XX women, children do not define you in the way that other achievements do'

Kind? No. Honest? Yes. But I’ve largely kept my opinions to myself since then.

Why? Because the Seventies brought the myth of ‘sisterhood’: that we women all had more in common with each other than with men. That we were victims, standing united against the male oppressor.

The movement believed itself progressive. In fact, it harked back to my mother’s coffee mornings and afternoon teas when it didn’t really matter who attended, for what they had in common (home, husbands, wombs, children, boredom) outranked all else.

It was a silly, insidious notion that grew to a corralling of women that has continued since: ‘sisters under the skin’, we are basically all the same. How often do you hear phrases that lump us all together, like ‘from a woman’s point of view’?

We similarly lump together ‘women’s forums’, the most renowned being Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: woe betide she (i.e., me) who admits to finding much of it utterly alien.

I might feel vaguely sorry for the plight of a woman from the low-achieving 85 per cent. But you cannot possibly expect me to feel closer to a migrant Bulgarian charlady of 30 just because we both have mammary bumps on our chests, than I do to a man of my own age, education, income and class. I do, of course, have many female friends. But I have none who is not an XX woman; not a graduate and not in paid work.

Many of my friends have children, but for us XX women, children do not define you in the way that other achievements do.

For example, without question, I take greater pride and joy in my daughter and my granddaughter than in anything I have achieved professionally.

Outside the sisterhood: Carol has never understood how women bond over coffee mornings and make-up

And yet I would be astonished to be introduced as, ‘Carol — she has a daughter, you know,’ rather than, ‘Carol — she’s a writer,  you know’.

I have met women from the other side of the yawning gap who attempt to define themselves by their domestic skills but, for me at least, it simply doesn’t work.

One, Joanne, is so proud of her blessed fruit cake that she speaks of it as her signature achievement. Once, she tried to teach me how to make it. First, apparently,  you soak the raisins in brandy for six weeks …

But I quickly lost track. I’m simply not interested.

Much like my teenage conviction that make-up is a small pleasure not a night out, so I think that cake is a sweetmeat, not a conversation.

'I believe I am a woman with a life fully lived, who has never, ever wasted time on a coffee morning'

All of this, and much more, is the stuff of Alison Wolf’s liberating book: at last, ruthlessly exposing the feminist myth of ‘sisterhood’, here is a woman who says that, yes, these days, there are two kinds of women.

Furthermore, you don’t have to feel guilty if you’ve made it to XX factor status; there’s a lot that we XX women get right.

We lose our virginity later than the 85 per cent — research shows that British girls who go on to become graduates are less than half as likely to have underage sex as those who do not.

We marry and we marry for keeps; our divorce rate is the lowest among women. We marry our own: contrary to popular belief, XX women do not marry men who become ‘house husbands’. Such creatures are few and the arrangements usually unsuccessful.

XX women have fewer children, with 40 per cent choosing to have none. But when they do have them, they spend more time with their children than the women who work less.

Astounding? Only at first thought. Wolf’s findings are that although non-XX women spend more time under the same roof as their children, that includes time while the children are left playing video games in another room.

And before we all burst into a chorus of ‘I don’t know how she does it’, there are clues: XX woman pays for housework to be done and is much more likely to take the family out to eat, so saving valuable time. She also watches only a third as much television and sleeps an hour less, every night, than the low-achieving 85 per cent.

So I’m proud to be an XX woman. Unlike the majority of my sex, I believe I am a woman with a life fully lived, who has never, ever wasted time on a coffee morning.

In fact, if you visit my home, you’ll not find tea or coffee there at all. I don’t keep it, I don’t drink it and never have; even the smell makes me queasy.

I think it must remind me of something. Sorry, Mum.
