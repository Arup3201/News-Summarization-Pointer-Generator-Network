Tommy Robredo ended the run of 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios with a masterclass of experience versus youth in the third round of the US Open.

Australian Kyrgios is made for a stage like Arthur Ashe Stadium under the lights and powered his way into a 5-0 lead.

But 32-year-old Robredo is one of the canniest players around and he worked away at Kyrgios' raw edges to turn the match in his favour and win 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.

Robredo beat Roger Federer in the fourth round last year and will attempt to upset another Swiss, third seed Stan Wawrinka, in the last 16 this time.

Wawrinka did not even have to take to the court against Blaz Kavcic, the Slovenian pulling out of their clash before the start with a foot injury.

Wawrinka will hope it is a good omen because he was also given a walkover in the third round of the Australian Open, which he went on to win.

Fifth seed Milos Raonic ended the run of Victor Estrella Burgos in a tight match that was decided by three tie-breaks.
