Temperatures will soar into the eighties across much of England today on what is forecast to be the hottest day of the year so far.

It will hit around 27C (80.6F) in the South East, a full 4C hotter than Madrid and matching the top UK temperature this summer, 27C in Cupar, Fife, on June 18.

The average for July is 19.4C (67F) but the Met Office’s Nicola Maxey said: ‘Temperatures will be warm, in the mid-twenties in the rest of England.’

The hot conditions are expected to 
continue into tomorrow, but a band of rain will begin sweeping across 
Britain, bringing showers to much of England on Saturday.

It means cyclists taking part in the first stages of the Tour de France 
in Yorkshire this weekend will get a real taste of the British summer 
with a mixture of sunshine and showers.

John Griffiths, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: ‘It’s going to be a very wet start. Rain is expected to move in on Friday night and Saturday morning will see rain across pretty much the entirety of the UK.’

Monday will bring a mixture of patchy cloud and sunny periods with a 
maximum of 21C (69.8F) as Tour de France cyclists head towards the 
capital, he added.

On Wednesday, the mercury hit 24.6C 
in London and Essex. The
 warm weather and lack of rain was welcome news for tennis players and 
spectators at the Wimbledon Championships in South-West London.

The weather was also enjoyed by visitors to beaches across Britain and the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

At
 the Regatta on Wednesday afternoon, a sea of colourful club jackets, ties, long floral dresses 
and straw hats stretched out along the iconic stretch of the River 
Thames.

However, the 
upmarket attire was bordering on the uncomfortable for many of the 
15,000 fans as temperatures soared.

Some spectators were denied entrance to the Stewards’ Enclosure for not abiding by the Regatta’s ultra-strict dress code.

A
 hemline above the knee or too much cleavage was enough for officious 
blue-blazered officials to give a shake of the head to a few young 
women.

For those who got
 into the members-only club, they were banned from using a mobile phone 
and men were not allowed to have a bag with them.

Organisers said that this was to 
maintain the atmosphere of an Edwardian-era English garden party and is 
not a sign of the event’s elitist reputation.

A
 total of 494 crews have entered this year’s milestone Regatta, 
including 107 crews from 22 overseas countries, who will compete until 
Sunday.

Weather-wise, late this week 
there will be a North-South divide with patchy rain expected across 
Wales as well as northern and western England.

The top temperature recorded on Wednesday was 24.6C at both 
Northolt in North-west London and Writtle in Essex, at 3pm.

The Environment Agency has a single flood alert out for England and Wales, in place for the Upper River Loddon near Basingstoke, Hampshire.
