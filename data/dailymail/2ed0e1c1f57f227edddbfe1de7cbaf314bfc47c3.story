Expat pensioners living in the hottest parts of Europe like the Costa del Sol are finally going to lose taxpayer-funded help with their heating bills, it can be revealed.

Britain is spending £22million-a-year on winter fuel allowances for people living elsewhere in Europe, despite more than a third living in sunnier climes.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today condemns the 'absurd' handouts and vows to change the rules which have cost the UK taxpayer £130million in a decade.

People living in Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Malta, Gibraltar and France will lose out, but the taxpayer still faces a bill for pensioners in 25 countries including Poland, Bulgaria and Finland.

Last year Britain sent £8.7million in winter fuel payments to Spain, which enjoys much warmer winters than pensioners in the UK

The winter fuel allowance is worth at least £200 for the over-62s, rising to £300 for the over-80s.

Official guidance says it is supposed 'to help pay your heating bills' and is designed as a flat sum for all pensioners to put towards the costs of keeping warm during the icy winter months. 

But EU rules mean it can be paid to expats if they can show they have a 'genuine link with the UK', and the money does not necessarily have to be spent on energy bills.

As a result thousands of people living in warm European countries are able to receive the money, and spend it how they like.

In 2002-03, just 8,000 people in 16 countries claimed at a total cost of £1million.

But huge growth in take-up and EU expansion means that in 2013-14 a total of 135,285 people in 30 countries received £133million.

It includes 50,000 people in Spain, 30,000 in France, 3,300 in Portugal, 8,000 in Cyprus and 2,000 in Greece.

Now ministers plan to introduce a new 'temperature test' to stop payments being made to countries where the average annual temperature is higher than the warmest region of the UK – the South West at 5.6C (42F).

People in Portugal, Spain, Greece, France, Malta and Cyprus will all lose the right to claim from September 2015. The Department for Work and Pensions today confirmed pensioners in Gibraltar will also miss out.

But the handouts will still be available to people in 25 countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland.

The cost of paying winter fuel allowances to pensioners living outside the UK has rocketed from £1million in 2002-03 to £133million in 2013-14, official figures show

If the rules had been in place last winter it would have cut the bill from £23million to just £7million. 

Mr Duncan Smith told MailOnline: 'Winter fuel payments exist to help Britain's pensioners keep themselves warm.

'It's absurd and offensive that taxpayers are funding these payments for people who have retired to the Mediterranean and enjoy warmer weather.'

Legislation to introduce the temperature test has now been laid in Parliament and will come into force for next winter, 2015-16.

Mr Duncan Smith added: 'The European Union has frustrated our attempts to address this issue in the past, but with our new temperature-based eligibility criteria we're able to satisfy EU rules as well as prevent this obscene waste of taxpayers' money.'

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the new temperature test would 'prevent this obscene waste of taxpayers' money'

The average temperature in Spain in December and January is 13C, almost double the average in the South West of England.

David Cameron vowed at the last election to protect the winter fuel allowance from cuts, despite complaints that the payments were not needed by wealthy pensioners.

However, both the Lib Dems and Labour have said it is wrong to pay the money to rich pensioners who do not need it.

Labour leader Ed Miliband used a speech earlier this month to set out his plan for 'common sense spending reductions, not slash and burn'.

He said: 'We have already set out ways in which we can save money [including] an end to the winter fuel allowance for the wealthiest pensioners.'

Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg has also warned the system is unfair. He said last year: 'The fact that we're asking people on low incomes to pay through their taxes to basically pay the fuel bills of people who don't need to heat their homes because they live in sunny parts of Europe and maybe didn't even work here before they retired, I think that lifts the lid on a wider problem in our welfare system.'
