Four men charged in the fatal carjacking of a young lawyer outside an upscale New Jersey mall last year have pleaded not guilty to felony murder and other charges.

The suspects entered their pleas Wednesday during brief hearings in state Superior Court in Essex County.

Hanif Thompson, 30, of Irvington, and Newark residents Karif Ford, 32, Basim Henry, 33, and Kevin Roberts, 36, are accused in the December 15th carjacking and killing of Dustin Friedland outside The Mall at Short Hills.

Authorities have said Friedland, a 30-year-old lawyer from Hoboken, was killed by a gunshot to his head while returning to his car in the mall parking garage with his wife, Jamie Schare Friedland. 

Two men approached him and his wife after an evening of Christmas shopping and demanded the keys to his 2012 silver Range Rover at gunpoint. 

The carjackers confronted the couple and Friedland was shot in the head, but his wife was unharmed. 

He died hours later at the Morristown Medical Center. 

Authorities have not said which defendant allegedly fired the fatal shots.

Tragedy: Friedland and his wife Jamie, who married in 2011, had been looking forward to starting a family together in the near future

Terror: One of the attackers entered the vehicle and ordered Friedland's wife out of the car at gunpoint

Friedman's silver Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack on December 15

The assailants drove off in the couple's silver Range Rover, which was found the next morning in Newark, about 10 miles from Short Hills.

Prosecutors have said the couple was targeted solely because of the make of their vehicle.

Jamie Schare Friedland filed a wrongful death lawsuit earlier this year, seeking unspecified damages. 

The suit claims the mall owners reduced security to increase profits and first responders mishandled a call for help, allegations those parties deny.

Millburn Police Chief Gregory Weber has said the ambulance actually arrived at the mall 18 minutes after the shooting, but the vehicle had trouble getting to the crime scene because it could not fit below a low ceiling at the entrance to the parking deck.

Eventually, emergency crews wheeled a stretcher up the entrance ramp to the level of the parking deck where Friedland was shot, Weber said.

Grieving widow Jamie Schare Friedland buried her husband just days after he was fatally shot in front of her

At her husband's funeral three days after his shooting, his 27-year-old wife remembered Friedland as a man full of integrity and chivalry, who always insisted on carrying packages and heavy things for her.

‘Dustin was the most chivalrous person. He would run to make sure he opened for car door for me. There wasn’t a bag anyone ever carried that Dustin didn’t help with.’

‘Dustin always did the right thing,’ she added.

The last of six speakers during the service, Jamie told mourners that despite her loss, ‘I’m truly the luckiest person I know, and I still believe that because I married the best man in the entire world.’

‘I was lucky enough to be with him in the time we had,’ she said. The couple, who married in 2011, had been hoping to start a family before the tragic incident.

‘There was not a better person, a better soul, in the entire world. He was my entire world and my happiness was the most important thing to him, always.’

‘He was kind, generous, giving, smart, loving, loyal, just the best person you ever met,’ she added.
