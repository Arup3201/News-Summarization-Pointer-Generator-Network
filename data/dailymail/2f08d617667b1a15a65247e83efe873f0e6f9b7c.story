Michael Gove faces another dressing-down from David Cameron after appearing to take a sideswipe at him, Boris Johnson and George Osborne for their antics in the riotous Bullingdon Club.

In an interview in today’s Mail on Sunday Event magazine, Education Secretary Mr Gove sings the praises of a rap singer who has mocked the Prime Minister, London Mayor and Chancellor for being members of the upper-crust Oxford group known for its drunken high jinks.

One song says Mr Cameron is a ‘dud’ leader who treats people like ‘serfs’ and makes people want to ‘punch him in the dimples’, and ridicules his claim to like the The Smiths pop group.

Another line says Mr Johnson is ‘simple’ and ‘spouts utter tripe', while Mr Osborne is ‘little Georgie who never bought a round’.

Mr Gove’s favourite rapper – Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer, real name Jim Burke – has also written a song about cocaine and another called More Kissing In Porn.

The Minister’s praise for Mr B comes 
days after he was rebuked by Mr Cameron for claiming there is a 
‘ridiculous’ number of Old Etonians in Downing Street.

From: THEY DON’T  ALLOW RAPPERS IN  THE BULLINGDON CLUBI chanced upon a blond scruffSpouting utter tripe‘Boris DePfeffel’ said he By way of introduction‘Want to join the chaps and I at a private function?’Now Boris knew his classics, But clearly was simpleDave inspired desireBut just to punch him in his dimplesHs gait was airy-fairyAnd his plans unsound And little Georgie never bought a roundCome to think of it, I didn’t want their jobsAnd why would Mr B hang around with such nobs?You can listen to the Smiths, But that’s far from the pithI’m heading for a snubAnd they don’t allow rappers in the Bullingdon Club

The remark was seen by some as an attempt by Mr Gove to highlight his humble roots as the adopted son of an Aberdeen fishmonger – in marked contrast to Old Etonians Mr Cameron and Mr Gove’s potential Tory leadership rival Mr Johnson.

Mr Cameron, Mr Johnson and baronet’s son Mr Osborne were all in the Bullingdon Club in their student days, but not Mr Gove, who went to Oxford after winning a scholarship to a fee-paying school.

Mr Gove says in Event: ‘I am strangely addicted to “chap hop” rapper Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer.’ ‘Chap hop’ is a quirky English form of American ‘hip hop’ that parodies English culture. Pipe-smoking, self-styled English gent  Mr B raps about high society, cricket, drugs, politics, tea, sex and the weather. He plays the ‘banjolele’, a cross between a banjo and a ukulele.

Mr B’s sideswipe at the Tory Oxford brigade is called They Don’t Allow Rappers In The Bullingdon Club, while Mr B’s Bullingdon Breakdown rap says: ‘Ra, ra, ra! We’re going to smash the oiks. Mr Major was dull to the untrained eye, but at least he liked cricket and wore a tie. It’s more than I can say for Dave, who thinks the serfs should behave.’

His The Crack Song lampoons rock stars for using cocaine to achieve fame and More Kissing In Porn asks: ‘So a crusade I’m going to start: Why can’t there be more kissing in porn?’

In the article, Mr Gove says: ‘I have a soft spot for contemporary English “eccentric” music. I liked Neil Innes and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band .  .  . and am strangely addicted to “chap hop” rappers Professor Elemental, Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer and Mr Bruce And The Correspondents.’
