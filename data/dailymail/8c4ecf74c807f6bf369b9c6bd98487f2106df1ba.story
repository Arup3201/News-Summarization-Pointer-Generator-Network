A wearable drone that is worn on the wrist has won a prestigious wearable contest run by chip giant Intel. 

Called Nixie, the drone folds up and attaches to a wrist strap, and is the world's first wearable drone. 

When the wearer wants it to start filming, they press a button and the drone unfolds and flies overhead, tracking their movements using motion sensors.

The Nixie wearable drone was created by researchers at Stanford University and is a finalist in Intel's annual Make It Wearable competition. Nixie is a drone, worn on the wrist (concept illustrated) and expands at the touch of a button. The team has created a prototype version and recently received $50,000 (£30,700) in funding

Last week, Polaroid and HTC both released details about handheld devices set to rival GoPro.

The former is planning to release the Polaroid Cube - a tiny action camera with a square design.

And a teaser video and leaked images reveal that HTC is planning to release a similar device of its own, in the shape of a toy periscope.

The Polaroid Cube will be available for £89 ($99.99) from 1 October. 

 HTC's camera is due to launch next month.

The drone then returns to the wearer's wrist, which could be controlled using a timer, or summoned using gestures.

It was developed by Dr Christoph Kohstall, a physics researcher at Stanford University, with colleagues Jelena Jovanovic and Michael Niedermayr.

Today, the drone won Intel's annual Make It Wearable competition.

As a result, the team has been awarded $500,000  to help make it a reality.

'We are very happy, humbled and really honoured,' Jelena Jovanovic of Nixie told MailOnline.

'We have all the core functionality of the drone - we've solved all of the hardest challenges, we have stable wristbands that can unfold and are stable in flight, and navigation is solved.

'The next stage is that we have half a million dollars, and we want to make it real.'

Jovanovic said the final product will be 'safe, beautiful and intuitive'

'Ww will target people who do adventure sports like rock climbers, we are offering a lot of value - and we think will be a bit more expensive that a GoPro.

'Ultimately we want to target the point and shoot camera market, and we want to be in than range.

'We hope we can revive the camera market.'

In addition to the prize money, all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the Santa Clara-based tech giant.

Dr Christoph Kohstall has also created an early prototype, which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year.  

'Nixie is a tiny wearable camera on a wrist band,' the firm said.

'The wrist straps unfold to create a quadcopter that flies, takes photos or video, then comes back to you.

'Nixie is in development. Stay tuned!'

Second prize winner, Open Bionics was awarded $200,000, using low cost, high efficiency 3-D printing and scanning to bring customized products to amputees for less than $1,000. 

Third prize winner and recipient of $100,000, ProGlove is offering an enterprise invention that seeks to reduce physical work stress, improve ergonomics and reduce costly workplace mistakes

Other finalists include the Vumbl sports and activity necklace, a wrist-worn air conditioning unit, and a production glove.

Make It Wearable is a year-long contest, open to students over the age of 13, designers, engineers, and makers.

CEO Brian Krzanich in January launched the 'Make it Wearable' contest to encourage entrepreneurs and hobbyists to use Intel's chips to develop new kinds of wearable technology. 

The prize money is meant to help the winners bring their prototype to market.

'This was an experiment to see what we could do in this space and see what kind of creativity we could spawn,' Krzanich said at an award event on Monday.

 'The real value in this was the diversity of the teams and ideas.'

Finalists included a pad that lets premature babies in incubators feel the heartbeat of their mothers, and a necklace that uses patterns of pulses felt on the chest to give cyclists turn-by-turn directions so they don't need to look at their smartphones.

Stanford University and physics researcher Dr Christoph Kohstall has also created an early prototype, (pictured) which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year. It is unknown when the Nixie will go on sale, and how much it will retail for, but MailOnline has contacted the firm for more information

Samsung Electronics, Motorola and other technology companies are rolling out growing numbers of smart watches and fitness bands, but the wearable category has yet to gain major traction with consumers. Apple plans to roll out a smartwatch in 2015.

Intel, whose chips are ubiquitous in personal computers and servers, this year bought health tracker startup Basis. It also has teamed up on other wrist-worn gadgets with Fossil and Opening Ceremony.

Krzanich, a weekend tinkerer who restored a 1974 Land Cruiser in his free time, is betting that other hobbyists have as much chance as major technology companies of dreaming up compelling wearable computing gadgets.

In addition to the prize money, all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the Santa Clara-based tech giant. The winner of Intel's competition will be announced on 3 November. This illustration reveals where the camera on the Nixie drone is positioned

To that end, Intel launched Edison, a tiny computer packaged in an SD-card form factor aimed at making it easy for clothing and gadget makers to integrate the platform into wearable products.

Earlier this year, Helio Aerospace Industries unveiled the first 'pet' drone that automatically follows its owner - and could change the way sports are filmed.

It is not wearable, like Nixie, but the Airdog drone can be fitted with a GoPro camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports, tracking everything from skateboarders to BMX riders.

AirDog tracks and follow users and their trajectory, and has a flight time of up to 15 minutes. It can also reach speeds of 40mph (64km/h).

To use AirDog, a programmable remote is strapped to the wrist or helmet, and it is likely to retail for $995 (£612).
