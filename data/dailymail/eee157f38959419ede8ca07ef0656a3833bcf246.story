The shocking New York ‘catcalling’ video which went viral internationally last week has been recreated in New Zealand with extremely different 

In a stark contrast, the model is mostly ignored by passers-by during her five hour experiment. 

In the original video, aspiring actress Shoshana Roberts was filmed walking through New York city for 10 hours, and was subjected to 108 catcalls and even followed by several overly-persistent men.

She was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments, including: 'What's up beautiful?', 'Hey baby', 'sexy' and ‘damn, girl!’. 

It appears that Kiwis are far more polite, as model and yoga instructor Nicola Simpson was treated respectfully during her five-hour experiment on the streets of Auckland.

Although she did received glances from admiring passers-by, who stopped or turned around to watch her, she was not confronted or harassed nearly as severely as the original video.

In her social experiment, Ms Simpson did not receive the same wolf-whistles, nor were suggestive comments yelled at her, and she was only approached twice which were both in polite circumstances.

Model Nicola Simpson recreated the New York experiment by walking through the streets of Auckland, New Zealand for five hours behind a hidden camera

Although the camera did capture people stopping to look at her, she did not receive the same contronting harassment that Ms Roberts was subjected to in New York

The New York video was filmed as part of a campaign for ‘Hollaback!’, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to ending street harassment.

Whilst Ms Roberts, 24, had suggestive comments yelled at her while she walked around New York City, dressed modestly in jeans and a high-neck t-shirt, Ms Simpson, dressed in a tracksuit, was left to her own devices.

New Zealand Herald were behind the latest experiment, filming Ms Simpson’s journey discreetly with a Go-Pro.

Although she does attract glances, she is only disturbed twice; once by a man asking for directions and the second time by a man who apologises for interrupting her.

The man who interrupts Ms Simpson is clearly taken with her, walking past her before turning around to introduce himself.

The man, who ‘sounds European’ according to the subtitles, jogs down the street to tell Roberts that she ‘looks nice’.

It may be interpreted as sinister, but the video makes it clear that he apologises for stopping her.

In a stark contrast, Ms Roberts is followed down the street by a man for more than five minutes, pestering her with comments like ‘you don’t want to talk?’, ‘if I give you my number will you talk to me?’

When the video was posted, NY-based Roberts explained her involvement in the awareness campaign by saying, ‘everyone has a right to feel safe.’

'This happens daily to so many people. We don't put up with harassment in school, at home, or at work, so why should we have to put up with it on the street?' The Herald explain that they shot the footage to try and measure the level of street harassment that women experience in Auckland.

They define street harassment as ‘sexual comments, catcalls and whistles from male strangers’.

Ms Simpson says that she found New Zealand men to be polite and that it was a refreshing change after her experiences living in New York for five years.

"It was nice, it was a change from New York. People were actually quite polite," she told New Zealand Herald.

"I didn't feel uncomfortable at all."

The New York experiment has received more than 33 million views.

The New Zealand appropriation has had more than 600 thousand clicks in three days.

The set off a storm of outrage since it was released Tuesday. 

Rape threats have since been directed toward Shosana Roberts, the woman in the video, according to multiple reports. 

The footage, which was shot and edited by Rob Bliss, was captured by a camera Bliss had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of Roberts, who was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and walked silently along. 

Unwanted attention: Shoshana Roberts appeared in the original video, which showed the catcalling she experienced over a ten-hour period on the streets of New York

Speaking about the experience of making the video, Roberts told The Post 'I felt like crying and I have occurrences in my past of sexual assault, so I wasn’t even aware necessarily of all the times people were saying things to me. I was just going over in my head and reliving, unfortunately, these memories while I was walking. I wanted to break down in tears.'  

Emily May, executive director of Hollaback!, the anti-street harassment organization that put out the video, told The Washington Post 'It’s hitting a nerve. Certainly, people are coming out of the woodwork and saying some really offensive and misogynist things.

'We’ve had a number of rape threats and violent threats against Shoshana and we’re pulling those down as quickly as possible, but they exist. That’s scary and I think what they’re trying to do is scare her and scare us into not speaking out about this. And both of us are saying no, we need to talk about this because if we don’t talk about this, if we don’t get this story out, then none of this is going to change.'

Hidden camera: The footage was captured by a camera Rob Bliss had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of Roberts, who walked silently along

Bliss told The Post 'I’m getting some blowback, but not nearly as bad as Shoshana. Right now she’s getting a lot of threats and things like that and it’s just so sad. It’s like the video is now being echoed in real life.'

At no point did Roberts make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them. That didn't stop the comments from coming. 

When she didn't respond, one man told her, 'Somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful. You should say thank you more!' 

Stalked: One man walked next to Roberts for five minutes as she walked through New York City

Another criticism was that some men's comments seemed innocuous: 'Good morning,' 'Have a nice day.'

'Some men could have been 'genuinely being nice,' Gerard Burke, a Brooklyn resident who readily acknowledged street harassment exists and has seen it happen to women in his family, told the AP. He said he thought the video shed light on a bigger problem, 'but some people just genuinely want to say hello.'

That's the problem with street harassment, May told the wire service, because when there's a fear that a simple good morning could escalate into sexual comments or actions, there's a reluctance to engage at all.

Everyday: Roberts said the number of comments she received on the streets the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her
