Showdown: Chief whip Andrew Mitchell will face the backbench 1922 Committee on Wednesday

Senior Tory backbenchers will warn Andrew Mitchell that his foul-mouthed outburst at police has damaged the party and undermined support among MPs.

The Tory Chief whip will get the message when he meets the six members of the executive of the influential backbench 1922 Committee on Wednesday.

The meeting is one of three hurdles Mr Mitchell has to clear if he wants to hold on to his job, senior Tories have said.

The Chief Whip is facing calls to quit after allegedly calling police officers ‘f******* plebs’ after they refused to let him cycle through the main gate of Downing Street.

Mr Mitchell says he will sit next to David Cameron during Prime Minister’s Questions at noon on Wednesday.

Labour MPs have launched a ‘Get Mitchell’ operation and are planning to cause mayhem by shouting abuse at Mr Mitchell and at Mr Cameron for refusing to sack him.

Later that afternoon Tory MPs with a grievance will be able to state their views at a meeting of the 1922 committee. There will be a slot in the agenda when MPs can raise any issues of concern.

Chairman Graham Brady will then lead a six strong delegation for a regular meeting with the Chief Whip.

Allies of Mr Mitchell say he has the backing of the majority of ministers and MPs. But many have privately said they think he should resign.

‘It is the 1922 Committee’s role to communicate the views of MPs to the Chief Whip. You can be sure they will do that,’ one member of the committee hierarchy said.

Mr Mitchell will come under further pressure because Labour will challenge Tory candidates for crime commissioner to say whether they think he should resign.

Labour candidates for the new posts, who are elected next month, will today receive letters putting them on the spot.

A Labour source said: ‘The letters will challenge the Tory candidates to say whether or not they agree that Andrew Mitchell should resign.’

Mr Mitchell won growing public support from the Cabinet yesterday, as a series of ministers took aim at the Police Federation for using the incident as a stick with which to beat the government in their row over cuts.

They are angry the Police Federation of West Mercia called for Mr Mitchell to quit after a meeting on Friday, even though the Met officers concerned have accepted the Chief Whip’s apology.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘His conduct was unacceptable, he’s accepted that. He’s apologised.

'I think really the matter should be left there. He’s issued a full, public apology. He’s apologised to the person, to the police officer concerned.

‘I think it’s a mistake for the Police Federation to be trying to use this in the way that they are.

'I think frankly we need to get on with sorting out issues and challenges related to policing.’

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Clearly these instances aren’t helpful and you should never be rude to a policeman.’

But asked how many MPs had come up to him and said Mr Mitchell should go, Mr Shapps replied: ‘I cannot recall a single MP who has come to me.’
