The Duchess of Cambridge proved one again that she's a high street princess as she swapped yesterday's Alexander McQueen for blue L.K Bennett for a visit to the Tower of London.

Laughing with one of the Beefeater guards and with General the Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower as she arrived at the fortress, the Duchess looked stylishly sober in her blue dress and conservative navy suede court shoes.

Like yesterday's cream Alexander McQueen, the blue colour of the dress was a nod towards the peace that was shattered 100 years ago yesterday.

And the catastrophic effect on the people of Britain and the Commonwealth of the end of peace was made plain by the poppy field the Duchess, Prince William and Prince Harry had come to see.

Brushing a tear from her eye as she toured the installation, the Duchess appeared deeply moved by the sight, as did Prince William and Prince Harry.

Entitled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the installation will eventually see 888,246 ceramic poppies planted in the moat - one for every soldier from the UK, Australia and the Commonwealth killed during the Great War.

Sweeping down through a window and down into the moat, the first poppy in the installation was planted by a yeoman warder on the 17th July and the last will be put in place on the 11th November to coincide with Armistice Day.

The Tower, long a critical part of 
London's defences, also had a role to play during the Great War, first 
as a recruitment station and later as a prison.

By the end of August 1914, more than 1,600 men had enlisted at the Tower, forming the 10th Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, the so called 'Stockbrokers Battalion', which fought on until the end of the war.

It was also during World War One that the last executions at the Tower took place, with 11 German spies meeting their end courtesy of a firing squad stationed on Tower Green.

Today, however, was all about the British men who went off to war and never came back, with Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge all planting poppies during their visit.

The three, who last night represented the Queen at a service at St Symphorien cemetery in the Belgian town of Mons, were also given a tour of the installation and wandered through the massed poppies in silence.

While the installation can do little other than jog memories for the men of the Stockbroker's Battalion, visitors to the poppy field will be asked to donate to one of six service charities.

Among them are Combat Stress, which helps veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,  Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.
