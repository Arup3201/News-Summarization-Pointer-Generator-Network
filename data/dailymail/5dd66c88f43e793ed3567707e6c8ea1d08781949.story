A veterinary technician tragically died after falling down a steep cliff in a Philadelphia nature park as she desperately searched for her missing dog on Wednesday - not long before the canine was found nearby.

Deborah Tobin, 48, was looking for her runaway brown Labrador mix in Eco Valley Nature parkin the Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania, before 7pm when she slipped.

The body of the Bala Cynwd woman was found in a car park at the base of the cliff about three hours after her family reported her missing.

Family members called police about 7pm, according to philly.com.

After an extensive search, Tobin's body was 
found in a parking lot on the 100 block of Rock Hill Road about 11.45pm

Police said an accidental misstep on the steep mountain led to her tragic death.

The missing canine was found nearby.

Tobin's devastated brother said his sister was a dog lover who always surrounded herself with pets.

He told Fox 29 Tobin returned to her hometown of Bala Cynwd last month after living in Florida for years.

After her dad died in May, she wanted to return home to care for her mother.

According to her profile on the website of the Miami Veterinary Internist where
she had worked, Tobin was employed at The University of Pennsylvania 
Veterinary Hospital for 10 years before moving to Florida.

She had spent 12 years working as an internal medicine technician.

The animal lover was a fan of the New England Patriots football team and loved walking on the beach with her two dogs Abbey and Stewart.

Tobin's friend of 25 years Karen Ebberts told Fox 29 Tobin had a huge heart.

'It's sad. It's a life. It's a life that's not here,' she said.

'I just feel really bad for her mom. Really bad. She was very good daughter.'
