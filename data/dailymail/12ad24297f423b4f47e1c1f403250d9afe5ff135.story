This is the shocking moment two men chained up and abandoned a pit bull outside a supermarket in freezing temperatures - prompting her to chew off her own paw in a desperate bid to escape.

The fugitive suspects, who are yet to be identified, were captured on surveillance video dumping the mixed-breed dog, named by rescuers as Courtney, outside a Wal-Mart in Detroit, Michigan.

They then drove off, leaving the animal alone in the frigid weather, with a thick cable around her leg. As she grew colder, it is believed Courtney chewed off and ate her numb paw to try to escape.

Fortunately, the two-year-old dog was later rescued by a horrified store employee, who stumbled across her in a bloodied state and called the police. Officers then notified Animal Control.

Horrific: The pair then grab hold of a pit bull, named by rescuers as Courtney, and dump her on the ground

Ready to go: They then drive off, leaving the animal alone in the frigid weather, with a cable around her leg

Saved: As she grew colder, it is believed Courtney chewed off and ate her numb paw to try to escape. Above, the pit bull is pictured at the offices of the rescue charity 4 Paws 1 Heart following her rescue last Sunday

During an examination, vets found part of Courtney's paw in her stomach. They believe the cord was wrapped around her leg so tightly it may have stopped blood gushing from the wound.

Although Courtney did not chew off her entire paw during her ordeal last Sunday, vets decided to amputate her leg, deeming it the most humane course of action to avoid the risk of infection.

Diana Rascano, the president and co-founder of rescue charity 4 Paws 1 Heart told the Detroit Free Press: 'They thought the toxins could have easily gotten into her blood system.' 

She added that following the amputation, vets examined Courtney's stomach. 'They felt a lump in her stomach and saw there were shards of bones, which were her paw,' she said.

'She had not only chewed it but eaten it. They had to do surgery because the shards from the bone could have caused issues with her intestine.'

Incredibly, Courtney is now recuperating from her injuries and is expected to make a full recovery.

The pit bull is currently being looked after at Wittner's Hopeful Heart Rescue home. After she has completely recovered, she will be adopted via the home, Click On Detroit reported.

On Saturday, the surveillance footage of the local Wal-Mart's exterior was released in a bid to help Roseville Police track down the two men who apparently left Courtney to die in the cold.

Speaking of the horrific footage, Ms Rascano said: 'The leash, it was like a cable, it was very thick and had tied around her leg and actually acted as a tourniquet.

'The vet said what saved her was the tourniquet that caused the blood flow to stop. And the subfreezing weather may have frozen some of the wound so that she didn't bleed to death.'

She added that Courtney is a 'sweetheart' who has not let her traumatic experience impact her friendly demeanor. 'She's been walking around licking everyone. She's just the sweetest dog,' she said. 

A police investigation is ongoing.
