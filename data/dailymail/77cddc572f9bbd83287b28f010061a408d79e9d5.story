'Murdered': The sister of Shafilea Ahmed (pictured) broke down in tears as she described the moment she witnessed her parents allegedly killing her sister

The sister of Shafilea Ahmed told a jury yesterday that she had been ‘haunted’ by the memory of the 17-year-old’s murder at the hands of their strict Muslim parents.

Alesha Ahmed, who was 15 at the time, kept quiet about what she claims to have witnessed for seven years before she finally ‘snapped’, she said.

Facing the prospect of an arranged marriage and being sent to Pakistan – the same destiny which allegedly provoked Shafilea’s ill-fated rebellion – she said she too defied their parents, going to university and drinking alcohol.

‘I was living between two cultures and trying to please everyone,’ she told Chester Crown Court. ‘It had haunted me for a long time, what happened to my sister.

‘I felt like I was going down the same path as my sister had gone down in terms of going to Pakistan, in terms of being 21 years old and supposed to be married. It was just a lot of pressure.’

Her father Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and mother Farzana, 49, deny Shafilea’s murder.

The trial has been told that Alesha’s ‘bombshell’ description of the couple allegedly suffocating Shafilea came after she organised a robbery at her parents’ home in Warrington.

Alesha told the court she had moved back to the town and was struggling for money, but her parents refused to help out.

‘I think I just absolutely snapped,’ she told the court.

‘It was either living the way they wanted me to or living on my own, and both were a struggle.’

However, she said, the gang ‘turned’ on her, and after hearing them saying her name, her mother and brother became suspicious and told police.

It was following the raid that she finally gave an account of how she says her parents killed Shafilea seven years earlier.

‘It all got too much and it was a relief to be able to tell someone finally,’ she said.

The trial has heard that Shafilea wanted to lead a ‘westernised’ lifestyle, wearing the same clothes as other girls her age and having boyfriends.

This brought her into conflict with her parents’ traditional Pakistani culture and their ‘concept of shame and honour’.

A row which began over a T-shirt she had worn to work, plus money found in her bags, escalated into both parents suffocating her with a plastic bag in front of all  her siblings, Alesha has claimed. Shafilea was reported missing a week after the alleged attack in September 2003 after a former teacher heard rumours that Alesha had told schoolfriends their father had killed her.

But Alesha denied it when police spoke to her at the time.

She now says she was fearful of suffering the same fate as her sister if she told of what she had seen.

Five months later Shafilea’s body was found dumped beside a river  in Cumbria.

Giving evidence for a third day hidden by a screen from her  parents and the public, Alesha, now 23, said it was only when she went away to university that her effort to live with a terrible secret began to unravel. ‘When you get used to something, it becomes  normal,’ she said.

‘But that is when I saw that it is not normal and what happened to my sister was wrong.

‘When it’s your own parents you don’t see things like that because you still love them.’

She added that her parents had been trying to set up an arranged marriage for her, with one suitor coming to the family home.

‘I did not want to get married – I didn’t even know the person,’ she said.

‘I was told I would have to go to Pakistan but I absolutely didn’t want to. I was told constantly.’

Alesha said she later moved back to live in Warrington, but not with her parents, and the pressure of making ends meet led to her organising the robbery.

She refused to name the three or four men involved in the robbery but admitted: ‘I contacted them, it was my responsibility.’

Shortly afterwards she came  forward with her account of Shafilea’s murder at the hands of their parents.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC  has told the jury they will have  to decide whether or not Alesha’s account of her sister’s death is  true or if it is ‘a wicked lie made up to help herself’.

The trial was adjourned.

A desperate Shafilea swallowed bleach during a trip to Pakistan after her mother told her she was to stay there permanently, her sister said.

Alesha said Shafilea – then 16 – went straight to the bathroom, then moments later 'everyone just heard her screaming and she was holding her stomach'.

Next to her was an industrial-sized bottle of bleach with the lid off.

The incident, in March 2003 during a power cut at her grandparents' house in rural Pakistan, badly damaged Shafilea's throat.

Their grandmother said she needed to go to hospital, but the girls' mother reacted differently, Alesha told the jury. 'I'm sure she said she was okay when it was very clear she wasn't,' she said. 

In hospital, Alesha said, her mother told Shafilea to say it was a mistake and she was 'supposed to drink mouthwash but because it was dark she drank bleach instead'.

The prosecution say Shafilea had been drugged and put on a one-way flight to Pakistan after trying to cut her ties with her parents.

While she was in the village where both her parents were born, several local families proposed that Shafilea should marry their sons, said Alesha, giving her photographs of men with moustaches and oiled hair. 'She was just not interested at all.'

After the bleach incident, Shafilea returned to England for hospital treatment. She lost more than two stone because she could not swallow food.

One side effect was that she needed saliva to be wiped from her face regularly when her family visited her, said Alesha. 'Mum just made a face about not wanting to wipe it up', so one of the sisters or their father did it instead.
