Turkey yesterday launched retaliatory strikes against Syria for the fourth consecutive day.

They were ordered after mortar bombs fired from Syria landed in a field in southern Turkey earlier in the day.

The Turkish response followed Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan’s warning to the Syrian regime that his country would not shy away from war if provoked.

Five Turkish civilians were killed by Syrian shelling on Wednesday.

The strikes and counter-strikes are the most serious cross-border violence in Syria’s conflict, which began as a uprising against the Assad regime but has evolved into a civil war.

Fears are now growing that the entire region could be destabilised.

Warning: Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would not shy away from war if provoked

Erdogan said on Friday his country did not want war but warned Syria not to make a ‘fatal mistake’ by testing its resolve.

Syria has said its mortar shells hit Turkey accidentally.

A local governor in Turkey said the two rounds fired from Syria appeared to have been aimed by government forces at rebels along the border.

There were no casualties.

A Turkish border post retaliated with six rounds of mortars. 

Turkish artillery bombarded Syrian military targets on Wednesday and Thursday, killing several Syrian soldiers. 

The United Nations Security Council condemned the original Syrian attack and demanded that such violations of international law stop immediately.

Syria has ordered its warplanes and helicopters not to enter an area within six miles of the Turkish border and told its artillery units not to fire shells in areas close to the border, according to Turkish broadcaster NTV.

Syrian authorities have not confirmed this.

The United States has said it stands by Nato ally Turkey’s right to defend itself against aggression spilling over from Syria’s war, while Russia appealed to Turkey to stay calm.

NATO member Turkey was once an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad but turned against him after his violent response to an uprising in which, according to the United Nations, more than 30,000 people have died.

Turkey has nearly 100,000 Syrian refugees in camps on its territory, has allowed rebel leaders sanctuary and has led calls for Assad to quit.

Its armed forces are far larger than Syria's.

On Friday Erdogan his country did not want war but warned Syria not to make a "fatal mistake" by testing its resolve.

Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Saturday that parliament's authorisation of possible cross-border military action was designed as a deterrent.

'From now on, if there is an attack on Turkey it will be silenced,' he said in an interview with state broadcaster TRT.

Western powers have backed fellow NATO member Turkey over Syria but have shown little appetite for the kind of intervention that helped topple Libya's Muammar Gaddafi.

Turkish calls for a safe zone in Syria would require a no-fly zone that NATO states are unwilling to police.
