An NHS trust accused of making a woman infertile after a botched appendix operation is  trying to cut compensation for the mistake because they say she would not have been earning as much if she'd had a baby. 

Sarah Marquis claims she was 'rendered infertile' by doctors at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London, after her appendix burst in 2008.

The 41-year-old lawyer is suing Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for £1.5million in the belief that it is to blame for her infertility. 

Sarah Marquis, 41, is suing Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust after a botched operation left her infertile 

But while the trust admits causing her injuries, it claims it does not owe her so much money in compensation as if she had been able to give birth she would not be earning as much. 

Instead it believes she is entitled to £300,000, with lawyers acting on its behalf telling the High Court that Ms Marquis's career would have been hampered if she'd ever given birth. 

The Court heard how the woman was admitted to hospital in 2008 after complaining of abdominal pains at her GP. 

She was treated with painkillers for three days before surgeons decided to remove the inflamed organ. 

But by the time they got round to operating, Ms Marquis's appendix had burst and an abdominal infection had set in. 

As a result she lost her ability to have children naturally. 

Describing the hospital's role in her ordeal, Ms Marquis's counsel Cara Guthrie said: 'Had it not been for the negligence of the defendants, Ms Marquis’ appendix would not have perforated.

'She would have made a rapid and uncomplicated recovery, avoiding an extended hospital stay, and she would not have been rendered infertile.'

As a result of the botched operation Ms Marquis had to take time off from her £85,000 a year job and missed out on promotions abroad, she added.  

While the Trust's barrister admitted it was to blame for the complications, he denied her claim that she was entitled to £1.5million.

Lawyers acting on behalf of the trust said Ms Marquis, who is also a Labour councillor, would not have been earning as much money if she had a baby. The hearing at the High Court (above) continues

He argued that rather than move up the career ladder her earnings would have slowed down as a result of giving birth. 

'The Trust acknowledges the fault on its part that caused your injuries and it is sorry for that,' said Bradley Martin. 

'(But) the possibilities are that you would have got pregnant naturally in the six months you and your partner decided to really try for a baby after the negligence.

Speaking of her long term partner who she began living with shortly after the surgery he added: 'You moved in together in order to have a baby.'

He rejected her earlier claim that had it not been for the operation she would have been selected to work in the company's American offices as he said she would have been pregnant.  

Ms Marquis rejected his accusations. The 41-year-old had undergone IVF treatment in the past to become pregnant. 

'If that was my only time to have a child then I would have done so...(but) I do value my career at the same time.

'I wanted to get my life back to normal. I had been off work effectively for three and a half years.'  

The hearing continues.
