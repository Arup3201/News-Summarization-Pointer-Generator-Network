Controversial: German chancellor Angela Merkel has said unemployed youngsters in the Eurozone should be prepared to move for work

German chancellor Angela Merkel has risked incurring the wrath of struggling eurozone countries by saying unemployed youngsters should be prepared to move for work.

Describing the current levels of unemployment across the eurozone as a 'huge crisis', Merkel said there would need to be more mobility among its workforce.

Her comments come after recent figures showed unemployment had soared to a record high of close to 20million.

The figures showed youth unemployment had surged to a devastating 24.4 per cent – meaning one 
in four Europeans under the age of 25 who want work cannot find a job.

Speaking to the BBC, Merkel said that when unemployment among young people in her own area of East 
Germany had risen 'many young people... only had jobs because they 
moved to the south'.

She added: 'I think it's unfair that it is the young people especially who have to pay the bill for something they didn't do.

'But there's no way around it. We have to manufacture products or offer services in Europe that we can sell.'

Her comments are likely to prove controversial in countries such as Spain and Greece which have previously criticised Merkel as they struggle against rising unemployment.

During her interview, Merkel also maintained that the policy with trying to drag Europe out of the crisis was correct.

She told how the issue is not austerity but how to get back to growth. She also 
defended the policy of tight controls on spending.

Speaking following the latest unemployment figures released last month, Anatoli Annenkov, senior European economist at French bank Societe Generale, said the worst-hit countries are at risk of a ‘lost generation’ who will never find work.

It is feared that rocketing unemployment
– particularly among the young – will fuel resentment against the euro 
and trigger a break-up of the single currency bloc.

Worrying: Chancellor Merkel's comments come after recent figures showed unemployment had soared to a record high of close to 20million

The European Commission warned that unemployment across the region is ‘unacceptably high’ and threatens ‘grave social consequences’.

French president Francois Hollande said it could lead to the breakdown of Europe. ‘Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project,’ he said. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said European ‘unity’ was at risk.

Italian labour minister Enrico Giovannini said: ‘We have to rescue an entire generation of young people who are scared.’
