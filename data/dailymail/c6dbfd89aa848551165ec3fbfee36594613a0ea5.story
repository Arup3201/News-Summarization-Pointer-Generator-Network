Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham yesterday in a wheelchair.

The twin girls, Melody and Rose Clarke (pictured above in images released by the family), died from multi-organ failure on November 4

Wearing her favourite colour red, she was wheeled behind the twins' tiny coffins as they were carried to the crematorium in a white horse-drawn princess carriage.

White teddy bears were placed inside the carriage along with matching floral tributes.

A card showing a picture of Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin, 31, cradling their tragic twins simply read: 'God Bless you Melody and Rose.'

Reverend Denise Jones, who led the service, paid tribute to Melody and Rose saying they were two 'very very special baby girls'.

She told the 50-strong congregation: 'They were much loved and wanted twin girls and baby sisters to little Slater.

'The last few weeks have been a journey of great courage, determination and faith. The loss of our children is the most painful thing to ever have to experience in our lives.

'Melody and Rose touched the hearts of all of us here today as well as the community and world and they have left behind a beautiful legacy of love.' 

Hymns 'All Things Bright and Beautiful' and 'Lord of the Dance' were sang by the congregation who all dressed in bright colours on the request of Ms Bennett.

Mourners were played 'Somewhere over the rainbow' at the end of the 40-minute ceremony.

The babies were delivered by emergency caesarean while Ms Bennett fought for life after collapsing at her home in Druids Heath, Birmingham.

She was 32 weeks pregnant when she called 999 early in the morning of October 29 after suffering suffered a placental abruption.

When paramedics arrived 12 minutes later at 5.51am, she was in such pain that she could not press the door buzzer to let them in.

Funeral of Melody and Rose at Lodge Hill Crematorium, Birmingham.

Tragically, her neighbours refused to buzz the ambulance crew into the council-run tower block because they thought the blue flashing lights were from police vans about to raid the flats.

When police finally arrived to let the paramedics in, they found Ms Bennett lying unconscious on the floor of flat - 30 minutes after her initial 999 call.

She was rushed to hospital where 4lb 1oz Melody and 3lb Rose were born by emergency caesarean.

Tragically, while Ms Bennett slipped into a coma, her baby daughters suffered multi-organ failure and their life support was switched off. They passed away on November 4.

The devastated father of Ms Bennett, Joe, 54, said yesterday: 'This has been a tragic time for Jocelyn and everybody in the family.

'We are grateful for all the support and glad Jocelyn was able to attend the service.

'There are still questions which need answering as to why the paramedics were unable to get to Jocelyn sooner but today is about saying goodbye to Rose and Melody.'

Following their deaths, Mr Bennett wrote a poem for each of the girls. 

He previously told how neighbours in the block of flats refused to answer their buzzers to police following a recent raid.

'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid.

'No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them.

'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place.' 

Birmingham City Council is investigating why paramedics were unable to gain access to Ms Bennett's home in Pleck House. 

A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and an urgent investigation was commissioned as soon as we were made aware of the matter.' 

Tributes placed with the coffins from relatives of Ms Bennett offered condolences and love to the family

Prior to their deaths, the Bennett family held a 'Christmas' party for the twin girls and had them christened.  

Ms Bennett's father, his wife Lorraine, and the girls' father Mr Clarke held a small party in hospital for the twins.

Mr Bennett said they documented the party, in which they dressed up in Christmas hats and jumpers, so that they could show Ms Bennett photographs when she awoke from her coma. She came round on November 16. 

At the time of the party, Mr Bennett said: 'It was all for Joyce for when she comes round. We can show her the children were loved and that they brought love into our lives.

'I don't want her to see sad pictures. They were baptised on the day they were born as we knew that was what Joyce had wanted.'

After the party, Mr Bennett and his wife dressed the babies in the clothes their mother had chosen to take them home in.

On the day they passed away, the hospital chaplain performed a touching service before the babies were placed in their father's arms for one last cuddle.

Mr Bennett and his family held the babies and celebrated an early Christmas with them before their deaths
