Floyd Mayweather has revealed that his rematch with Marcos Maidana could be one of the final times fans can see him in the ring - after announcing his plan to retire in 2015.

The 37-year-old stated ahead of the bout that he sees himself fighting twice more - against 'exciting' opponents - next year before hanging up his gloves for good.

With a split-decision victory in the original fight against Maidana in May, the American extended his undefeated professional record to 46 bouts.

And, in the press conference on Tuesday ahead of the rematch, Mayweather said: 'I only got two more fights left (after Maidana) and after the next two fights I just want to build the Mayweather Promotions brand.

'As of right now, my focus is on Maidana. I can't focus on the other two fights after that. I have to focus on Maidana.

'After that we can't say who the next two are going to be but I'm pretty sure the next two will be exciting fights.' 

Despite insisting he is planning two 'exciting' bouts for 2015, Mayweather refused to be drawn on speculation that the much-anticipated Manny Pacquiao-Mayweather superfight could happen.

Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum had suggested there were on-going talks between the camps but Mayweather watered down the speculation. He also suggested Arum was merely trying to promote Pacquiao's upcoming fight with Chris Algieri, which takes place on November 22.

When asked about the possibility, Mayweather responded: 'Not true. I can't say what the future holds.

'But Arum and Pacquiao are trying to sell tickets for the (bout with the) guy named Algieri. Trying to sell tickets for that fight.'

In the short-term, however, Mayweather is focusing all his attention on beating his dangerous Argentinian opponent Maidana for a second time.

The first bout saw Mayweather win on a split decision - with the judges scoring the fight 116-112, 117-111 and 114-114 - but Maidana has an impressive record himself.

With 35 victories and just three losses in 38 professional match-ups, the 31-year-old poses a serious threat to Mayweather's unbeaten record and could scupper his plans for two final bouts before he signs off next year.
