Last week, in the company of a Manchester United great, David Beckham spoke passionately about the spirit and soul of the club. He is fiercely protective.

As a nervous, young apprentice, he recalled the cigar smoke from Sir Matt Busby’s office wafting through the corridors at Old Trafford.

There was a sense of belonging about the place, and he felt the history of the club when he walked out of the tunnel at Old Trafford for the first time.

That stuff makes the hairs on your neck stand on end.

It was at the stadium, after the extensive redevelopment of the Stretford End, Scoreboard End and North Stand in the Nineties, that Beckham became a modern, matchday idol.

‘Like having 75,000 parents watching you,’ he recalled during an instructive half hour with the former United and England midfielder.

In many ways it was a nostalgic trip for Beckham, winding the clock back to a time when he first trained with United after winning the Bobby Charlton Soccer School one summer.

Pastures new: The former United academy graduate has now moved on to Arsenal for £16m

Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes, the Neville brothers and Beckham were brought up at The Cliff, making their way through the academy before they went on to win the FA Youth Cup in 1992.

This is all part of the club’s grand and illustrious past, but as Louis van Gaal looks to the future he must keep the spirit and soul of this club alive.

This coming Friday, the United manager will speak for the first time about his decision to sell Danny Welbeck to Arsenal on transfer deadline day for £16million.

On paper, with Radamel Falcao being added to a list of forwards that includes captain Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Adnan Januzaj, it was a straightforward decision.

Welbeck’s finest moment in a United shirt was his header at the Bernabeu in a Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid in February 2013. All in all, there were not enough of them.

What cannot be ignored is his affinity to the club, joining United’s academy at the age of eight, having his picture taken with Giggs and making his way through the club’s junior teams.

It is a rich tradition at United and it is possible that Van Gaal isn't even aware that they have included a homegrown player in every matchday squad since 1937. It is 3,704 games and counting.

In their last Barclays Premier League game, at Burnley prior to the international break, United started with three graduates from the youth team. Five more were on the bench.

That powerful statistic is not in danger yet, but a return to the days when Sir Alex Ferguson organised trials for every kid in the north west after his arrival in November 1986 are long gone.

Those trials, supervised by the former youth coach Eric Harrison, harvested the Class of 92. They will never see the like again.

Instead, United are operating in an era of rampant commercialisation. Every square inch of this club is for sale.

Every quarter brings another outstanding set of financial results and with it the news of another sponsorship deal with a food or soda supplier from south-east Asia.

To keep pace with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona in the annual Deloitte Money League, that is what they have to do.

Next season they will revert to adidas, switching kit manufacturer after striking a deal that is thought to be worth £750m over the next 10 years.

These glorified announcements are a modern trend, a flag-waving exercise designed to pacify those restless supporters who are concerned about the direction of this institution.

They have entered the messy world of third-party ownership after bringing Falcao on loan from Monaco for a season, with an option to sign the striker permanently next summer.

He is a first-class forward, but you have to question the influence of those in his inner circle when he opted to join Monaco, a team who were not in the Champions League at the time, instead of a European superpower in 2013.

Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester City all turned down the chance to sign one of the world’s best forwards this summer. There has to be good reason for that.

Van Gaal has not had a break since the World Cup, charging straight into his new role at United and the American tour that he complained about so bitterly. Much of that was down to his own mental fatigue.

The recruitment strategy is incoherent, throwing money at the problem by signing Luke Shaw, Angel di Maria and Falcao.

It is to be hoped that they all come good, particularly given the sense of urgency that has prevailed since David Moyes was fired last April.

Moyes got it wrong, of course, misjudging the mood of the place after Ferguson retired after winning his 11th Premier League title in 2013.

Van Gaal has promised glory eventually, committing himself to various targets over the past few weeks.

Along the way, he will have to take a bit of history with him.
