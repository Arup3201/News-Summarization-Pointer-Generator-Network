Scottish police have apologised after its official Twitter account was used to brand journalist Toby Young ‘a right t*t’.

The Police Scotland feed posted the insult during a debate on Twitter abuse on BBC2’s Newsnight.

The force is now reviewing who has access to its official account.

Gaffe: The official Police Scotland account posted this message aimed at journalist Toby Young

Mr Young was a panellist on the BBC show last night, debating rape threats posted online with Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has been the target of abuse.

He has been an outspoken opponent of details anti-harassment rules being imposed on Twitter.

During the discussed the @policescotland account: ‘A revelation for #newsnight (UK) viewing tonight seeing @toadmeister make a right t*t of it with @stellacreasy #longwaytogoladies.’

But today Police Scotland had deleted the message and issued an online apology.

It said: ‘We apologise for the tweet sent to @toadmeister & for any upset caused. The matter is being investigated & we're reviewing Twitter access.’

In response, Mr Young said that he told police he hopes ‘the poor, overworked drudge who probably confused his/her personal Twitter feed with the official one he/she is responsible for, wouldn't get into trouble’.

Clash: Labour MP Stella Creasy has been targeted by Twitter trolls and was discussing how to report abusive messages with journalist Toby Young on Newsnight

The journalist said he does not intend to lodge a complaint. Writing in a Daily Telegraph blog today, Mr Young said: ‘I'm on Stella Creasy's side when it comes to the police needing to follow up genuine threats of rape and murder on Twitter, whether directed against men or women.

‘But the police shouldn't bother to investigate run-of-the-mill troll gibberish - and I hope this silly mistake deters them from doing so in future.

‘Sometimes, when someone says something you disagree with on television, it's hard not to get overexcited and tweet something you later regret, as @policescotland demonstrated.’

Earlier this week Miss Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, was the target of abusive messages on twitter threatening her with rape.

She was told on Twitter she would be tracked down and raped, with the terrifying threat: ‘Shall we meet near your house?’

Ms Creasy was targeted because she had backed feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez who suffered similarly vile online messages - leading one alleged abuser to be arrested and bailed.

The MP has also been subjected to abusive messages on YouTube.
