Some people think pit bulls have a bad reputation, but a pair of former shelter workers in New York formed such a deep bond with one such stray they're scouring the internet to find him again.

Since pit Marco Polo left their care at Animal Care & Control of New York City, his adorable face has gone viral in posts on the often misunderstood breed at The Huffington Post and Buzzfeed.

Now his old friends want to know how he's doing and are searching on Craigslist.

Pit Marco Polo touched shelter workers so deeply that years later they wonder how he's doing

Marco Polo's former guardians set up a Craiglist ad looking for information about the pooch after seeing his adorable face in several viral stories on pits

The post reads: 'Is this your dog??? We are two former volunteers from Manhattan Animal 
Care & Control - one of us took these pictures, the other is posing 
in them, we think about your dog almost every week as we loved him at 
the shelter and these photos of him went somewhat viral and often appear
 in news stories about pitbulls. We know he was adopted around June 
15th, 2011 but never saw him leave, we'd love to know how he's doing and
 perhaps get a few recent photos! We're not stalkers - I swear! :) 
Thanks so much!'

Sabrina Paige, the former volunteer who took the pics accompanying the ad, has fond memories of Marco Polo.

'I remember him being really 
sweet. I see the pictures of him all the time, but never really knew 
what happened to him,' she told The Huffington Post.

Former volunteer Sabrina Paige said she remembers the dog as 'being really sweet'

Paige said it's not uncommon for shelter workers to develop deep bonds with dogs they only briefly meet

Paige said she's yet to get a lead on Marco, but is certain he's found a loving family.

'At the shelter, they come in and receive a six or seven 
digit number and are one of thousands of dogs,' she said. 'It's always 
really nice to see them adopted and find out how they're doing. It's 
amazing how much they impact the volunteers' lives. You definitely get 
attached. '

If you recognize Marco, let Paige know how he's doing.
