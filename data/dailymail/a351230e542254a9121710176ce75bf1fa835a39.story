A toddler born with a rare defect has made a miraculous recovery after surgeons were forced to break open her skull and piece it back together like a jigsaw.

Laurie Jones was born with craniosynostosis, a condition which causes the skull plates to fuse together in the womb.

It caused Laurie to have a twisted head, with one side bulging.

And as well as causing the deformity, the condition threatened to create fatal pressure on her developing brain.

Laurie Jones was born with craniosynostosis, a condition which causes the skull plates to fuse together in the womb. It left the newborn with a twisted head, one side bulging and her parents were warned it could cause pressure on her developing brain

But after a nine-hour life-saving operation at Birmingham's Children's Hospital the now two-year-old is back at home with her parents Sadie Roberts and Steve Jones, and her sisters Hollie and Jess

But, after a nine-hour life-saving operation, which involved a full blood transfusion, Laurie, now two, is back home with her parents Sadie Roberts and Steve Jones, and her sisters Hollie and Jess. 

Her mother Ms Roberts, 38, said: 'Laurie really is our jigsaw baby.

'The front of her skull was taken off, broken into pieces and then put back together.

'She was cut from ear to ear across the top of her head - it was really difficult to see.

'She had a full head-bandage and her eyes were swollen - she was very poorly.

'We were told at any time it could put pressure on her brain.

'One doctor was concerned there was not enough room for her brain to grow and it could have ended with us losing her.'

Craniosynostosis is a rare condition affecting affects one in 2,500 babies. It causes babies to develop an irregularly shaped skull. 

It caused Laurie's head to grow abnormally, and meant she didn't have an eyebrow on one side.

After the live-saving surgery at Birmingham Children's Hospital, she is just like a normal two-year-old, but she may need further surgery on her eye in later life.

Craniosynostosis is a rare condition affecting affects one in 2,500 babies. It causes babies to develop an irregularly shaped skull. Laurie has been left with a large 'jigsaw' scar stretching from ear to ear, right

She will have checks on her head for the next 10 years, but her mother Ms Roberts added: 'It will take two years for her head to completely enclose and be like a normal child's, so we will have to be careful with her'

Craniosynostosis is a rare condition, which causes babies to develop an irregularly shaped skull.

The abnormal shape of a child's head can cause persistent headaches, learning difficulties, problems with vision.

Symptoms of craniosynostosis result from increased pressure in the skull, called intracranial pressure.

The condition causes a baby's skull to prematurely fuse, leaving it unable to grow in certain areas.

Where one area is fused the skull is prevented from growing.

It causes other parts of the skull to 'overgrow' to compensate and limit the pressure devleoping around the brain.

The lack of growth in some areas, and 'overgrowth' in others causes the irregular head shape.

Saggital synostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis, accounting for around half of all cases.

It occurs when the suture - the elastic tissues connecting the plates of bone in the skull - at the top of the head fuses.

It leads to a lack of growth in width and compensatory growth in length, resulting in a long, narrow skull.

Ms Roberts, from Richards Castle, Shropshire, said: 'Laurie is incredibly bright and mischievous as you'd expect a two-year-old to be, but it has been really hard.

'We always said if it was just for cosmetic reasons we wouldn't put ourselves through that, but if her condition compromised her future we'd have to go ahead.

'It's been really stressful on all of us, really.

'It will take two years for her head to completely enclose and be like a normal child's, so we will have to be careful with her.'

Laurie will continue to have checks on her head for the next 10 years, but now she has recovered from her life-changing operation, the family have agreed to speak out to raise awareness of the condition.

Ms Roberts said she is indebted to Cranio Ribbons, a support network of parents who have seen their children go through similar operations, who have a Facebook page.

She said: 'I want to show other families going through the same thing there is light at the end of the tunnel, to show what it's like on the other side.

'The parents on there have been an absolute Godsend.

'You can go on there and vent any feelings you've got and there are people there who know exactly how you feel.'

She said another Facebook group called Lucy's Head Start aimed to raise money for parents whose children need craniosynostosis operations.
