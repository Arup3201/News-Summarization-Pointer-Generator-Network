Pen pal: Former Penn State coach and convicted child rapist Jerry Sandusky wrote two letters from prison to friends, revealing that his time behind bars has been 'very challenging'

For convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky, adjusting to a life in prison has not been easy, according to his jailhouse letters made public this week.

Sandusky is currently serving a 30 to 60 year prison term for raping and sexually abusing between 10 and 15 young boys.

The correspondence between Sandusky and his pen pals has been obtained by the site TMZ, shedding light on his experience behind bars, which the  69-year-old described in one of the letters as 'very challenging.'

In the handwritten missives sent by Sandusky from Greene State Correctional Institute in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, he continued to present himself as a victim while noting that he is trying to ‘get better.’

The disgraced former Penn State coach called his conviction a ‘grave injustice’ and vowed to continue to battle the case 'until the last whistle.'

In a letter dated May 19, Sandusky wrote to an unnamed friend that 'coaching at Penn State was an act of love and the many wonderful experiences have been a great reward in themselves.'

Describing his time behind bars, Sandusky wrote, 'it is very challenging,' adding that he spends his days exercising, reading, mediating and doing a lot of writing, mostly about his case.

'For now, my main purpose is to endure, learn from, and grow from this experience,' he stated.

The convicted rapist went on to talk about God and his reliance on his faith before concluding, 'I'm hanging in there.'

In a second letter from June 16, Sandusky took a more defiant stance, talking wistfully about his desire to reveal 'all the information and unfairness.'

After a brief aside about a childhood memory of playing baseball with his father, Sandusky went on to talk about 'an excellent' summary of the case against him that has been written by 'a lady from Oregon.'

The inmate wrote that the woman ‘suspected injustice’ and has been trying to get the support of some 'knowledgeable people' who, Sandusky hopes, might help his appeals process.

The convicted rapist concluded his missive on a note of self-reflection, writing: 'I'm trying to get better.'
