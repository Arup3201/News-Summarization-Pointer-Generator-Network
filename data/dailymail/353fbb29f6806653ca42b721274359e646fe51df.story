 

The former Romanian tourism minister and presidential candidate, Elena Udrea, is being held on charges of money laundering and influence peddling.

The glamorous MP, who finished fourth in November's presidential election, was detained for 24 hours late on Tuesday after she entered the anti-corruption prosecutor's office to answer charges.

A court will now decide whether to arrest her for 30 days.

Prosecutors said she is charged with influence peddling in the illegal licensing of software in schools and money laundering. 

She is also accused of asking for a £370,000 bribe to give preferential contracts while organizing the 'Gala Bute' event as a minister of tourism, an event to promote the Romanian boxing champion Lucian Bute.

Lawmakers voted to approve her arrest Monday on three charges. Udrea, who founded the Popular Movement Party last year, denies wrongdoing.

The 41-year-old gained notoriety due to her close relationship with Traian Basescu, Romania's president from 2004 to 2014. 

She participated in several controversial pictorials and is known for wearing expensive clothes and buying international designer purses.

The investigation is part of a case involving nine ex-ministers and several businessmen accused of facilitating contracts for preferred companies that sold Microsoft software licenses to the state.

The total value of the contract was £35.5 million, out of which the defendants allegedly claimed £13.1 million as a bribe. 

Udrea's ex-husband, businessman Dorin Cocos, has also been arrested.

The minister has vowed to fight the charges, accusing officials of orchestrating her arrest. She said: 'They can handcuff Elena Udrea, but they cannot handcuff the truth.'

She accused General Florian Coldea, interim president of the Romanian Internal Intelligence, of setting up her arrest, claiming he is involved in major corruption cases and wants her silenced.

A parliamentary commission organised a hearing for General Coldea but found no proof that her claims are true.

Udrea was the minister of tourism between 2008 and 2009 and also the minister of regional development and tourism between 2009 and 2012.

In her last position, she administered a yearly budget of £2.37 billion.
