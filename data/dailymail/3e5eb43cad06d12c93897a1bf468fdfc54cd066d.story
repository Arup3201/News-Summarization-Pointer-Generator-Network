The wife and daughter of a Chicago lottery winner who was poisoned with cyanide after winning $425,000 in Illinois have settled his estate..

Urooj Khan, 46, died in July 2012, days before he was to collect his in winnings. His brother raised suspicions that prompted authorities to exhume Khan's body to gather evidence in case prosecutors decide to file charges.

Khan died without a will, leading to a court battle - his widow, Shabana Ansari, 32, hired an attorney and will receive one-third of the winnings, their house and business.

Khan's daughter from another marriage, Jasmeen, 17, will get two-thirds the lottery proceeds and some investments.

The
settlement approved yesterday also prevents either party from filing a 
wrongful death lawsuit against the other unless new evidence surfaces in
a criminal investigation.

In March 2013 the coroner investigating the cyanide death revealed he couldn't say if his final meal killed him.

Stephen
Cina, the chief medical examiner of Cook County in Chicago, said that 
an autopsy revealed no trace of the poison whatsoever in the body of 
Urooj Khan, including his stomach.

Dr Cina said that too much time had passed and the body was so decomposed that any cyanide would have evaporated by now.

At a press conference Dr Cina also revealed that Urooj had a blockage in one of his arteries that ‘wouldn’t have helped’ but said that it was the poison that ultimately killed him.

Urooj’s widow is said to have served 
Urooj his last meal of a traditional Indian Kofta curry just hours 
before he collapsed at their Chicago home.

He would have died an agonising, horrific death as the cyanide suffocated him cell by cell.

Urooj, who ran a successful dry cleaning 
business, died on July 20 last year, the day after he collected the 
oversized cheque from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven 
where he bought the winning scratchcard.

After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum.

His initial toxicology tests did not find anything suspicious and it was not until a relative asked the Cook County Medical Examiner to take another look that the cyanide was found and the death was ruled a homicide.

His body was exhumed but in a press conference Dr Cina said that the results were not conclusive.

He said that a ‘lethal’ level of cyanide was detected in a sample taken from Urooj’s body on July 21, the day after his death.

However, when tests were carried out on the body which was exhumed in January, ‘no cyanide was detected in the tissues or the small amount of gastric contents’.

This is because cyanide has a short half-life and would naturally have evaporated out of the body, he said.

Dr Cina said: We couldn’t detect cyanide. That doesn’t mean that it wasn’t present at some point.’

He added that ‘the route of administration could not be confirmed’, which means that it will likely never be known whether Urooj ingested or inhaled the poison or if it was injected into him.

There was also ‘severe, about 75 per cent blockage of one of the major coronary arteries’ which made Urooj ‘particularly susceptible to this type of toxin’.

The cause of death however was still cyanide poisoning and it is still being treated as a homicide, he added.

Urooj’s death has united his family against Shabana, who they make no secret of blaming for his untimely demise.

His brother ImTiaz Khan has alleged in probate documents that Shabana attempted to claim the windfall ‘shortly’ after he died but for some reason was unable to.

His sister Meraj Khan successfully won custody of Urooj’s 17-year-old daughter Jasmeen even though she appears to have lived with Shabana, her stepmother, most of her life.

In another twist, the Chicago Tribune has reported that Fareedun owed $124,000 in unpaid taxes because of a small business he owned that appears to have failed.
