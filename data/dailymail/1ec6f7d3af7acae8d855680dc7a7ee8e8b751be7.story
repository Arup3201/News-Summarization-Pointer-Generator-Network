Andy Murray said it was impossible to choose between brother Jamie, and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier as best men, so will invite all three

Andy Murray has announced he will have three best men at his wedding when he marries to long-term girlfriend Kim Sears next month.

The British tennis star says the honour will be shared between his brother Jamie, close friend and fellow tennis player Ross Hutchins, and former training partner Carlos Mier.

Murray, 27, is due to marry Miss Sears, who he has been dating for nine years, in a ceremony at his luxurious Comlix House Hotel in Dunblane on April 11.

The Wimbledon champion has previously played best man at brother Jamie's wedding when he married Alejandra Gutierrez at Cromlix House in 2010, and when Ross Hutchins got hitched to Lindsay Wood last year.

Murray told how he was not feeling nervous about the wedding but would be more apprehensive about starting a family.

He said he couldn't choose who should be his best man and so decided on asking all three to keep up with Kim, who is having four bridesmaids.

He said: 'I'm actually not nervous about getting married to be honest, we've been together about nine and a half years so, we've lived together for six, seven years as well so I don't think a whole lots going to change.

'I think I'll be more nervous about starting a family because I feel like for me, that would be more life changing, in a good way but, I kind of feel we have been married already in the way we spend our lives together and live together so I'm not that nervous about the day at all.

'I'm going to have a couple of best men. Jamie's going to be one of them, Ross is also going to be a best man.

'Hopefully my good friend Carlos from Spain, in Barcelona.

'The thing for me is it's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because Kim has four bridesmaids and I was saying well, 'why is that fine for you?'

'Imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you've had since you were at school. it's very difficult to chose one.

Murray said it was unfair that Kim was allowed to name four bridesmaids, while he was only allowed one best man, so picked three including his brother (pictured, the pair play together during the 2012 Olympics)

'She was like, "Come on, come on, pick one". I said, "No, it's difficult, so I think I'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come".'

Murray and Hutchins are former roommates and known to be very close. When Murray won the Brisbane International in 2012, he dedicated the win to Hutchins.

In a post-match speech he paid tribute to a 'friend' who was watching back home, adding 'you're going to get through', a reference to Hutchins diagnosis with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer.

Murray has since revealed that his double-handed victory salute, in which he points both index fingers at the sky, was a sign to Hutchins to show he was thinking of him.

Mier, meanwhile, was Murray's roommate and hitting partner while he was at Academia Sánchez-Casal in Spain.

The Peruvian has continued his friendship with Murray over the years, and still joins the Scot for the occasional practice. 

Speaking about his choice of best men, Murray added: 'I didn't spend loads of time with my brother when we were 15-20, he was training in France.

The hotel underwent an extensive redevelopment after it was bought by the tennis ace and re-opened last year where suites can go for up to £600 per night

'I was training in Spain, and my friend Carlos, he was my best friend during that time, which were very important years of my life when I moved away from my family and my friends and he was the guy who was always there for me, he was my best friend though that period.

'I feel like he knows extremely well from then, my brother knows me obviously since I was a child, and Ross over the last six or seven years, we've become extremely close and we've been through a lot together as well.

'So, picking one was for me, a very, very difficult thing to do because I had three guys who were clearly my three best friends and I would like all of them to be involved in some way.'

Murray said he had no firm plans for a honeymoon yet but added: 'We will probably do it later in the year, probably in the off season. I'm not sure where we're going to go yet but there's a few ideas.'
