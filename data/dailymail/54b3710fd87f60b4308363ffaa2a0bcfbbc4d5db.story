A middle school teacher in Atlanta, Georgia, has been caught on video delivering an expletive-laden rant to a classroom full of student.

The cell phone footage shows the Crawford Long Middle School teacher unleash on a male student because he fails to shut the door behind him when he enters class.

'I'm trying to do something, and I can't keep babysitting you. Close the door!' the unidentified teacher screams.

But the boy ignores her and walks towards his seat. Angry, she yells: 'Stop! I ain't f***ing playing with you. You want to play? Stay home with your mama.'

Rant: A middle school teacher, pictured, in Atlanta, Georgia, has been caught on video delivering an expletive-laden rant to a classroom full of student

The video was shot by a female student who had complained about the teacher a couple of months ago to her aunt, whom she lives with.

'Two months ago, Yvette came home and said the teacher had said "f you" to her and to sit down," Santosha Manuel told WSBTV.com.Â 

'I told her, if it happened again, to get proof, and that's what her cellphone was for and to record it so that I would have proof this time.'

Manuel said she was particularly angry that the teacher, during the tirade, attacked the students' mothers.

'I have a f***ing job, half your mothers don't,' the teacher says in the tape.

'You are talking down to them, you are talking bad about their parents,' Manuel said, disapprovingly.

After Manuel handed Yvette's video to school officials, the teacher was almost immediately yanked from her classroom.

The Atlanta Public Schools school district confirmed the teacher in the video works at Crawford Long Middle School in southwest Atlanta.

They said she is on administrative leave while an investigation is undertaken.

'Atlanta Public Schools promotes a culture of ethics to which all employees are expected to adhere,' APS told WSBTV in a statement.

'This is a personnel matter that is currently being investigated. However, APS can confirm that the teacher is not currently assigned to work directly with students.'
