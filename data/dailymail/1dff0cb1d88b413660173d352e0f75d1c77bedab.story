Scott Disick has checked into a luxury rehab center in Costa Rica.

The reality star was pictured jetting off via helicopter to start his stay at the Rythmia Life Advancement Center on Monday.

In a statement released via the center, he explained: 'I realise my issues are bigger than me and I'm ready to truly remedy this struggle I continue to battle.'

It later emerged that Scott first visited the center back in February, but kept that spell in treatment confidential.

Scott's latest rehab stay came as it was revealed that he was found shoeless and drunk stumbling around his hotel lobby on Sunday morning after a paid appearance at an Atlantic City club.

The previous evening he had been openly downing shots of tequila before taking the microphone to rant onstage. 

A hotel source told TMZ that the reality star had to be escorted back to his room by a supervisor.  

The club promoter had already made headlines by cancelling three club appearances while in the UK earlier this month, only letting fans know at the last minute via Twitter.

Scott did not mention his recent troubles in his statement, instead explaining why he chose the center.

'While I have been unconvinced in the past of treatment and therapy methods, Rythmia's rehab approach puts my worries at ease,' he said.

'The fact that there is a money back guarantee that has never been called upon gives me even more confidence. I am looking forward to starting my therapy and iboga treatment there.' 

Scott will be treated with the controversial drug Ibogaine, which is made from the psychedelic African rainforest shrub iboga. Ibogaine reputedly causes hallucinations similar to LSD - it is banned in the U.S.

Perhaps not the perfect job: Despite difficulties controlling his drinking, Scott continues to promote clubs; he is seen on Saturday at Harrah's Resort in Atlantic City - where he was later found wandering shoeless around his hotel lobby

And the center even offers 'shaman-supervised flights' while patients are taking the drug.

While not undergoing treatment, Scott will certainly not be deprived.

The boutique rehab center is located in tropical Guanacaste, Costa Rica, on a private estate only minutes from the beach.

According to a press release it 'affords guests a secluded and serene environment with the utmost privacy.'

As well as undergoing 'intensive' rehab the 31-year-old can also make use of the fitness center, five-star restaurant and full-service spa with mud bath.

And indeed Scott knows exactly what he is committing to - having secretly visited the center in February.

'Scott was here last month,' Charles Johnston, director of addiction treatment at Rythmia told the magazine In Touch.

And he added: 'It’s just getting him to the place where he’s ready to give up that lifestyle and hopefully that will happen soon.'

This is certainly not Scott's first spell in rehab - just last summer he spent time in a treatment facility, as fans saw on Kourtney and Khloe Take the Hamptons.

It came after he was hospitalised for alcohol poisoning. 

The father-of-three's struggles to control his drinking have been a recurrent theme on the Kardashian reality shows, with viewers watching as Kourtney tries to support her long-term partner.

And following the death of both Scott's parents within months of one another, he has spoken openly of his unhappiness and anxiety.

Scott's mother Bonnie Disick, 63, passed away in October 2013 following a lengthy illness. His father, Jeffrey, died a few months later in January.

'I literally just want to jump out of my skin it's that bad,' he said of his anxiety on KAKTTH, admitting he was taking medication.

Scott and Kourtney welcomed their youngest son in December, with little Reign Aston joining big brother Mason, five, and sister Penelope, two.

A spokesperson for the family did not respond to requests for comment.
