Fed up of an mounting unpaid tab racked up by a government official, restaurateur Geng Weijie decided to take matters into his own hands.

Mr Geng, the owner of a braised pork-leg restaurant in central China's Henan province was owed a staggering £70,000 by a local government official, who had not paid for food for more than three years.

The frustrated 47-year-old hung two seven-metre-long banners reading 'Secretary Han Junhong owes me 700,000 yuan in unpaid dinner bills for the past three years' outside his restaurant in the town of Wangluo.

Geng said that for years local officials have been feasting in his restaurant without paying, reports ECNS.

'The officials just gave me IOUs,' said Geng, who produced two of them, both bearing local government seals.

His bold move paid off. A photograph of the signs found its way onto the internet and Chinese bloggers latched onto the case as another example of how politicos were abusing public cash.

Geng said he opened the restaurant in 1995 and that it eventually became an official canteen for the local government.

Officials always chose the restaurant to host guests, but not paying their bills put a huge economic burden on Geng and his family.

'I chose to hang the banners because I am now in poor health, and badly in need of money,' said Geng.

After the case was exposed online, the local government launched an investigation and admitted that Geng was telling the truth. He has since been paid in full.

The Global Times reported Han Junhong made a grovelling apology and has now been suspended.

'The money has been used to serve guests of the government,' said an official surnamed Zhao.

'The government has been experiencing financial stress, so the debt was paid off as soon as possible.'
