Al-Shabaab rebels have murdered at least 36 Kenyan quarry workers near the country's northern border with Somalia, police have confirmed. 

The gunmen crossed over the border and divided the Muslim and non-Muslim workers into two groups before opening fire.

Kenyan police chief David Kimaiyo confirmed the massacre took place early on Tuesday in Mandera County.

Al-Shabaab have been raiding Mandera County on the Somali-Kenyan border killing non-Muslims 

He has now been removed from his post, along with the Kenyan interior minister.

President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a televised address to the nation that he had replaced interior minister Joseph Ole Lenku, and accepted a 'retirement request' from Kimaiyo. 

Kenyatta named opposition politician and retired army general Joseph Nkaissery to be the new Interior Minister. 

Police sources said the workers were ambushed as they slept in the camp at the Korome quarry. The non-Muslim workers were singled-out and killed. 

Eyewitnesses claimed that 32 of the victims had been shot while the final four had been decapitated.  

Mandera county governor Ali Roba said: 'It is sad that we have another 36 people who were attacked and killed late last night in the same manner it happened on a bus recently. It happened at a quarry about 10 miles from Mandera town.'

Some 28 people were killed in the area last month when al
Shabaab militants hijacked a Nairobi-bound bus, causing
widespread anger. Kenya has suffered a string of gun and grenade
attacks since it sent troops into Somalia to fight al Shabaab in
late 2011.
