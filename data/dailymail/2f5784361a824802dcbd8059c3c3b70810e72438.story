FIFA have concluded there is insufficient evidence to open disciplinary proceedings against Croatian side HNK Rijeka over an alleged incident of racial abuse towards young Manchester City midfielder Seko Fofana during pre-season.

The club's Elite Development Side, managed by French World Cup winner Patrick Vieira, were playing their final pre-season game of a tour in Novigrad in July.

Fofana, 19, was sent off by the referee after being seen to kick out at his opponent but the club subsequently revealed their belief that Fofana, usually a level-headed young man, was racially abused by opposition players moments before he lashed out.

Elite Development Squad manager Patrick Vieira, once alerted to Fofana's complaint, immediately entered the pitch and after holding discussions with the referee and the City officials present, the decision was taken for his players to leave the field.

The news reverberated around Europe but five months on, Sportsmail can reveal that FIFA will take no action against the Croatian team.

A FIFA spokesman confirmed: 'The chairman of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee considered that, based on the information at his disposal, there were not enough elements to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings. Also in relation to this matter, the chairman was pleased to observe that Mr Davor Suker and Mr Patrick Viera engage positively to work through the issue.

'The relevant parties were notified on Friday, 5 December in the form of a letter, which also emphasised FIFA's zero-tolerance stance against any form of discrimination.'

City have become increasingly disillusioned by what they perceive to be the weak approach of UEFA towards racism in the game and this latest decision by FIFA will rankle wtihin the walls of power at the Etihad Stadium.

For the fifth time in just over two years, one of their players has allegedly become the victim of racial abuse.

Previous incidents include the subjection of Mario Balotelli and Yaya Toure to monkey noises in European competition, a banana being launched at Gael Clichy in a friendly at Limerick and Devante Cole, a young talent, receiving relentless abuse in a youth tournament in Madrid.

Vieira was praised in the summer by anti-racism groups but the Croatian side accused Vieira and his staff of an 'illogical decision.'

Ranko Buketa, the sport co-ordinator of HNK Rijeka, said: 'It seems that this is the way in which they are trying to hide a very hard tackle from a Manchester City player that resulted in an exclusion, followed by a hasty and illogical decision of the Manchester City coaching staff on the withdrawal of the team from the field. The game was most of all within the limits of fair play.'

He added that the fact they had six Nigerian players was evidence of their commitment to challenging racial prejudice.
