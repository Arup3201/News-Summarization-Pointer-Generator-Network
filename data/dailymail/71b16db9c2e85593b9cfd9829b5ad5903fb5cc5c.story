Train
 services between Bristol and Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, were delayed 
between 7am and 9am yesterday while workers tried to catch the animal.

Aimee Ramsay, who caught the cow walking through the station on camera, wrote on Twitter: 'Trains are delayed. Kamikaze cows everywhere #yolo.'

She added later: 'It's not so funny when you have to be in work! It's a real life Country File here.'

Twitter user Bea Lilley added: 'Reason I am late into work this morning!'

Trot along: The cow later wanders off along the track - oblivious to the railway chaos it was causing in Somerset yesterday

One witness, who was standing on the 
platform at Nailsea and Backwell station, described the chaos caused by 
the cow on the train tracks.

Plasterer
 Jack Wait, 18, from Backwell, said: 'I got to the train station to 
catch the train to work and there was just a cow wandering down the 
middle of the tracks.

'I
 couldn't believe it - it was huge. What it was doing on the train 
tracks, I'll never know. Maybe it wanted to go to the seaside.

'We were waiting for ages and all the trains were forced to stop.

'The
 cow ran off down the line to greener pastures and the train was 
eventually able to get to the platform, but by then there were so many 
people waiting that not everyone could fit on the train.

'I
 was late for work, but I feel a cow being on the train tracks is a good
 enough excuse. It's certainly an excuse my boss had never heard 
before.'
