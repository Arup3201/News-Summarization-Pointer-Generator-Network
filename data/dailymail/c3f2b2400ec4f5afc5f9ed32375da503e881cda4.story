Gina Rinehart recently hit headlines after she threatened to sue the Nine Network over it's portrayal of her in their recent TV mini-series 'House Of Hancock'. 

The two-part series drew attention from the mining magnate and she demanded to see the second episode before it went to air.

Ms Rinehart's solicitor Mark Wilks said after the program that Nine had been aware of glaring errors in the second episode that were misleading and 'twisted'.

Despite the network's disclaimer the show was a 'drama, not a documentary', it remained devoid of factual accuracy, he told AAP. 

There are four bathrooms in the home, two of which are ensuites
