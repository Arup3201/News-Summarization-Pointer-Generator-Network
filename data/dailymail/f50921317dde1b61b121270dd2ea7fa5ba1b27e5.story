Two teenage gang members have been jailed for a total of more than ten years after a 15-year-old schoolboy was repeatedly stabbed for his Beats headphones.

James Rawlinson, 18, from Liverpool, knifed the schoolboy repeatedly while his fellow 'Fernhill Gang' member Stephen Martin, 19, stole the victim's headphones, which are worth more than £200.

The youngster was making his way to his gradmother's house along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, an area controlled by the 'Lineacre Gang', when he came across three thugs who then called their friends for support.

Nine gang members then surrounded the helpless boy and asked him whether he was associated with their rivals.

Martin demanded that he hand over his headphones or he would stab him.

He tried to escape but Rawlinson, who was 17 at the time, stabbed him in the chest and back, while another gang member threw a brick which hit him in the face.

The boy staggered to his grandmother's house leaving a trail of blood, and was rushed to Alder Hey children's hospital.

Rawlinson continued to punch the boy until someone shouted that they knew the victim was no longer a member of their rival gang.

Simon Driver, prosecuting, said: 'In the months before these events, the south Sefton area was blighted by several incidents of violence involving feuding gangs.

Martin admitted robbery and Rawlinson pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent on the second day of their trial at Liverpool Crown Court.

'He did not align himself with either party but had friends in both geographical areas.'

Rawlinson was jailed for eight years as a result of the attack in November 2012 and was branded a dangerous offender after carrying out the brutal attack which left the schoolboy with a punctured lung.

Sentencing the pair at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge Robert Trevor Jones said: 'The incident overall was very disturbing and shocking indeed'

And Martin was sent to a young offenders' institution for two years and three months after stealing the boy's headphones.

Judge Robert Trevor Jones said: 'The incident overall was very disturbing and shocking indeed.

'And, I hardly need to add, utterly terrifying for your victim.

'He was just 15, going about his business of visiting family, but was unfortunate enough to walk into an area where both of you - forming part of a gang - felt he had no business being.

'Nine of you against one 15-year-old lad.'

The judge also said that Rawlinson represented a danger and added a four-year extended licence to his sentence.
