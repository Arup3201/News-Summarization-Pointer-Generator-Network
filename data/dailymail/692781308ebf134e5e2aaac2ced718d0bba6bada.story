As Londoners are no doubt all too aware, £25 won’t get you very far in the city these days.

In fact, it’s barely enough to cover a round of drinks.

SoHostel on the edge of London’s thriving SoHo district is charging travellers £25-a-night for a dormitory bed

The SoHostel on the edge of London’s thriving SoHo district are charging travellers the princely sum for a dormitory bed.

In fact, the cost is so cheap that it is even expected to appeal to locals who don’t fancy stumping up the often expensive cab fare home once the underground trains have stopped running.

The hostel is situated on Dean Street, W1, which is minutes away from Oxford Street, Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square.

It has room for 150 guests and also offers double rooms for £55-a-night.
