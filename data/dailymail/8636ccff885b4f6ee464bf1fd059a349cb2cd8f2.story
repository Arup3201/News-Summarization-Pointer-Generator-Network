Remains discovered in mass grave under Pentridge Prison and identified by DNA tests

Bushranger was shot by police in Glenrowan in 1880

Notorious: The body of Ned Kelly, Australia's most infamous criminal, is to be returned to his family for burial after more than a century

Australian outlaw Ned Kelly is to have his body returned to his family at last, after 130 years.

Authorities have agreed to give the notorious bushranger's descendants his remains for burial, more than a century after he was  hanged for murder and dumped in a mass grave.

His body was later exhumed from the grave at the Old Melbourne Jail and 
buried in another mass grave at the city's Pentridge Prison.

But it might not be third time lucky for the rogue, who was hanged for killing three policemen while on the run in the hills of Victoria.

Historians say that his new resting place could become a target for grave robbers.

Kelly's descendants have not yet chosen a cemetery for their infamous ancestor, but they have been warned to pick in a private place.

It will be 131 years ago this Friday that 25-year-old Kelly was executed in Old Melbourne Jail in 1880.

What were believed to be his remains were exhumed from Pentridge Prison in 2009 and DNA tests later proved the bones were those of the bushranger.

'From a family perspective, we want what every family wants - just a dignified family burial,' said Mr Anthony Griffiths, Kelly's great-great nephew, after Victoria's Attorney General, Mr Robert Clark, agreed this week to approve the return of the remains to the family.

Kelly's family were horrified last month when the Victorian authorities 
said they wanted to put the outlaw's bones on public display.

Mr Jeremy Smith, senior archaeologist at Heritage Victoria, who led the team that uncovered the remains, said: 'They were just about the best preserved of all the remains at Pentridge, so they were about 95 per cent complete.

'To get that definitive identification of the remains of Ned Kellyâ€¦ I really never thought that was possible.'

Mr Smith told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the majority of the skull was missing from the skeleton, which was found jammed into an old axe box.

Kelly was hit in the legs when he confronted police in his crude body armour made out of farm machine parts in the small town of Glenrowan in 1880.

Mr Smith said the skeleton showed damage from the bullet wounds.

Headless: Kelly's remains were identified after forensic examination

'There are a few elements, I guess 
his battle wounds from Glenrowan... there's damage to the toes on one of
 the feet where we know he was injured at Glenrowan, but largely other 
than those elements the skeleton is almost complete.'

Mr
 Griffith said one option for the burial place was the small town of 
Greta, south of Glenrowan, where Kelly's mother Ellen and several of his
 brothers and sisters and other relatives are buried.

But
 Kelly biographer Mr Ian Jones said graves of other family members have 
been interfered with and unless the master criminal's grave was 'an absolute bunker, a 
vault of some kind, I think his remains would not be safe.'

He
 added: 'Ned, you know, brings out the worst in some people. Even a 
headstone, you know, Ned Kelly's headstone, would be incredibly 
vulnerable to vandalism and theft.'

Ned Kelly as the Australian-born son of an Irishman, John 'Red' Kelly, who was sent to Tasmania for stealing two pigs.

His father died when he was 11-years-old, meaning he had to leave school and work on his grandfather's cattle farm to support his family.

As a teenager, Kelly was already having run-ins with the law and was repeatedly accused of stealing livestock. He was first arrested, aged 14, for assaulting a Chinese man.

He was also arrested for receiving stolen property and assault offences, and served three years hard labour while still in his teens. The family felt they were unfairly targeted by police.

Kelly later shot a policeman who came to visit in the wrist because he was trying to get friendly with his sister, Kate.

The officer vowed to pay the family back and made a false report which led to Kelly's mother being jailed for three years.

Kelly and his brother went into hiding, fearing more repercussions. Three officers were then killed in a struggle after trailing them and they became outlaws.

Over two years, the gang laid low in the bushlands of north-eastern Victoria - emerging to rob banks and the rich. During this time, they became folk heroes and symbols of Irish Australian resistance.

They were eventually cornered at the Glenrowan Hotel where, after a nine-hour siege, Kelly emerged in a full suit of armour but he was captured after being shot in the legs and charged with murder. He was later hanged but his name became one of legend because of tales about his daring and he is not an iconic Australian figure.
