This is the stunning moment a fearless diver came face to face with a 50ft whale.

The extraordinary encounter happened as diver Reinhard Mink swam in the sea near the Azores Islands in Portugal.

He suddenly found himself just inches away from the Sei whale - one of the fastest whales on the planet, with speeds of up to 40mph.

But instead of panicking and darting away, Mr Mink looked directly into the whale's eyes and posed for the camera.

The experienced diver, from Darmstadt, Germany, described the encounter as 'special' and 'exciting'.

'To get close enough to meet one of the biggest, fastest whales in the water doesn't happen very often,' he said. 'Even if you're lucky enough to see one, it's very rare to get so close.

'I
 looked directly into his eye and that's something I will never forget. 
That feeling of two species trying to understand each other was 
remarkable. It was a very special moment.'

Mr Mink had been working on a 
documentary about Sperm whales with cameraman Kai Matthes, scientist Rui
 Prieto and their skipper Emanuel when they were told a Sei whale had 
been spotted in the area.

With permission from the Azores government, they then dived into the water between the islands of Pico and Faial.

They were stunned to come within inches of the massive whale, which is part of the Baleen species.

'We tried to stay as calm as we could and not make any sudden or surprising movements,' said Mr Mink.

'The biggest surprise was that the whale showed an interest in us and chose to come very close.

Trip: Mr Mink and fellow crew members Kai Matthes, Rui Prieto and Emanuel tracked the whale for six hours by boat - a trip that spanned 35 nautical miles. Above, the massive creature surfaces near the diving boat

'At some points, we were face to face and eye to eye, with just a few centimetres in between.'

The crew then tracked the whale for six hours by boat - a trip that spanned 35 nautical miles from the south coast of Pico to the west coast of Faial.

'We had to jump each time from the diving boat and into the water near the whale. We went down approximately 12 metres each time,' said Mr Mink.

'We never expected anything like this to happen. Underwater pictures of Sei whales are extremely difficult to get because they are so shy and so fast.

'These pictures are very unique - it really was a once in a lifetime experience.'

Feeding time: Wildlife photographer Richard Dirscherl and his wife swam among the 26ft creatures as they were fed thousands of tiny fish by local fisherman off the West Papua coast in Cenderawasih Bay

Mr Mink and his crew are not the only divers to have come within touching distance of a large sea predator recently.

Wildlife photographer Reinhard Dirscherl and his wife Daniela were nearly swallowed up by feeding whale sharks as they dived off the West Papua coast in Cenderawasih Bay, Indonesia.

The pair had jumped into the water as the 26ft sharks - who can dive up to 1.2 miles deep - were fed thousands of tiny fish by local fisherman. 

They then swam with the predators as they drifted through the water at about five miles an hour - gobbling up the colourful fish in one go.

Mr Dirscherl, from Munich, Germany, said it was an opportunity he 'couldn't afford to miss'.

'With its mouth wide open, the shark plowed the sea and sucked hundreds of colorful fish down its throat,' he said.

'It came so close to me that I had to nudge it gently so it did not push me into one the nets.

'Then two more whale sharks joined in and I had to catch my breath as the greater of the two approached.

Opportunity: Mr Dirscherl, from Munich, Germany, said it was 'amazing' to be so close to the feeding sharks

'It was amazing to watch and to be that close to them.'

Indonesian fishermen, who work through the day and night, use high-pressure sodium vapor lamps to illuminate the surface of the water - luring in plankton and other small fish.

Once thousands of fish have gathered in the water, the lights are then switched off and the harvest begins.

Whale sharks usually wait until the nets are full of fish to pounce because, according to Mr Dirscherl, they prefer prey that they can catch with minimal effort.
