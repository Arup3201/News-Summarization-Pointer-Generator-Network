It may not be the smartest phone on the market, but Nokia's latest handset has one huge advantage - a battery that can last for a month between charges.

Called the Nokia 215, the handset is set to go on sale for just $29, and Microsoft says it is 'our most affordable Internet-ready entry-level phone yet, perfectly suited for first-time mobile phone buyers or as a secondary phone for just about anyone.'

However, - the firm has not yet revealed when - or even if - it will be available in the US.

The handset also boasts Bluetooth, so can be connected to a headset or speaker.

'With a built-in MP3 player and FM radio, Nokia 215 keeps you entertained for up to 50 or 45 hours playback respectively,' the firm says.

It also features Nokia's SLAM technology, which allows people to simply bring two SLAM-enabled devices together to send or receive files.

It will be available in green, black and white versions, and will initially go on sale in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe in the first quarter of 2015.

It will initially be aimed at emerging markets - and even includes a flashlight 

'A built-in torchlight provides convenience, whether it's late at night or after you've turned off the lights,' says Nokia.

'Or, for those who have no access to electricity (in 2014, that's still almost 20% of the world's population), the torch is a necessity.'

The handset also boasts Bluetooth, so can be connected to a headset or speaker.

Late last year Microsoft marked the end of an era in the smartphone world by launching the first Lumia handset without the Nokia branding, the 525.

The Windows maker bought the Finnish technology firm in a £4.4 billion deal in April, and has now shifted its Lumia brand of phones into its own Windows Phone range. 

Mobiles expert Rob Kerr from comparison site uSwitch says that this new smartphone shows there is no sentiment in the dog-eat-dog world of smartphones.

'By laying the Nokia brand name to rest, Microsoft is sending the message there's no room for nostalgia in the fast-moving mobile market.

'The path of least resistance would have been to use the Nokia name as a crutch, but Microsoft has loftier visions.

'And it's a tactic we've seen before when Sony dropped the Ericsson brand. 

Microsoft says the Lumia 535 will begin to ship in the UK some time in early 2015, with the price quoted only as 110 euros (£86) for now, but will begin to surface in the US later this month.
