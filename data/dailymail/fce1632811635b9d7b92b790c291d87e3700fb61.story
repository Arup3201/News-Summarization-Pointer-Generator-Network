It was February 1962 and a breathless Beatles fan had just been to see the Fab Four in concert.Setting the seal on her euphoria, she managed to get every member of the band to sign her ticket with love and kisses.

Later, in the ultimate act of friendship, she shared the prized ticket with a schoolmate, tearing it in two and giving up the piece signed by John Lennon, George Harrison and Pete Best, the band’s original drummer, while keeping the section autographed by her heart-throb Paul McCartney.

Fast forward to today, and that lucky friend, Susan Popland, now 61, is on a mission to make contact with the  concert-goer and reunite the tattered fragments.

Ticket to ride: Susan Popland wants to get in contact with her childhood friend Maureen Bradley in the hope she still has the other half of a signed ticket to a Beatles concert in 1962

She is selling her half of the ticket  
at auction today – but it would  more than double in value if it was 
sold with the all-important McCartney signature.

She doesn’t have a clue if the friend, Maureen Bradley, will still have 
the crucial item... as they have not seen each other for 40 years.

Mrs Popland was best friends with Maureen’s older sister Vivian, but it 
was Maureen who went to the concert in Birkenhead, near Liverpool and 
shared her ticket. The three girls drifted apart as they grew older.

Worth a fortune: The ticket is signed by John Lennon, George Harrison and original drummer Pete Best

Mrs Popland, from Stretford, Manchester, said: ‘I was a huge fan of  The
Beatles. I used to collect all of their memorabilia. But I had no idea 
back then that this ticket would be worth so much.

‘I’d like to find Maureen and Vivian, but I don’t know how to go about 
it. It’s been over 40 years since I last saw them. It’s just a shame as 
the ticket would be worth so much more as a whole.’

The ticket is due to be auctioned today at Omega Auctions in Stockport.

Mrs Popland’s half of the ticket is valued at between £1,500 and £2,000.
If it were reunited with the missing  signature, its value would rocket
to upwards of £5,000.

Starting out: McCartney, Lennon, Best and Harrison in 1962

Maureen went to see The Beatles just months before the band’s original 
drummer Best left the group to make way for Ringo Starr in August 1962.

The auction coincides with the 50th anniversary of the first Beatles album release, Please Please Me.

Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: ‘If the ticket was complete and 
included Paul McCartney then I am confident that this would sell for 
more than £5,000.

‘If the owner of the other half is out there and still has it, now is the time to dig it out.’
