Binmen could refuse to empty rubbish bins if their lids aren't fully closed under a city's controversial new regulations.

Residents could also be hit with £100 fines if they don't take their bins back to their home by the end of collection day, tough policy rules state.

Critics have slammed the strict new waste management regulations from Labour council chiefs at Southampton City Council, Hampshire, as 'farcical'.

Binmen in Southampton can refuse empty a bin if the lid won't close under new Labour proposals

Binmen will pick up any rubbish left next to the bin, but only to put it in the bin for collection a week later.

Any bin containing incorrect items will be left on the street until the offending waste is removed.

And repeat offenders could be fined or receive an 'education visit' from council officials to help them follow the rules.

Labour bosses have signed off a draft of the stringent terms, due to come into force next year.

But opposition councillors have hit out at the regulations and branded the scheme 'a load of rubbish'.

Conservative opposition deputy leader Councillor Jeremy Moulton disapproves of rules on rubbish that won't fit in the bin.

Known as 'side waste', it covers any rubbish not contained in the bin with the lid closed.

Cllr Moulton said: 'I think it's ridiculous. If people have more rubbish than they can fit in the bin, then it should be picked up if it's bagged up properly. That's what people pay taxes for.'

And Councillor Don Thomas, from Labour Councillors Against the Cuts, said: 'What a load of rubbish.

'You really could not make this sort of stuff up. It is farcical, it's more time-wasting and putting yet more work load on our bin men.'

Workers can pick up extra rubbish, but only to put it into the empty bin for collection the next week

But environment chief Councillor Jacqui Rayment, who is set to sign off the directives in the spring, says sanctions would be imposed as a 'last resort'.

Cllr Rayment said: 'We only want to enforce as a last resort. We want to educate so that people use their bins properly.'

The council says its binmen would 'operate flexibly' to take circumstances such as Christmas and New Year into account.

A council spokesman said: 'The council has targets to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill and to increase recycling.

'Disposing of additional side waste that is not recycleable costs the city more money.'

Crews will collect bins with lids that are not fully closed but in some cases it may not be 'possible or safe' to do so, he added.

Residents criticised the plans, which include bins containing garden waste being left uncollected.

Pearl Fletcher, a 58-year-old nurse from Southampton, Hants, said: 'I think this is ridiculous. If the binmen are going to take the rubbish away, they might as well take it all if it's there.'
