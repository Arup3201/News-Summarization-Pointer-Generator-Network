They are among the most famous trainers in film history - and according to Back to the Future, are available in 2015.

During Back To The Future II, Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, puts on a pair of Nike High Tops that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet - using so-called power laces.

Now, Nike has confirmed it plans to release the real thing this year.

One of the most coveted pieces of futuristic tech seen in the Back To The Future franchise was the hoverboard - a skateboard-style device that can levitate.

Inspired by this board, a team of Australian inventors designed the Baja board - a four-wheel drive motorised skateboard capable of reaching 31mph (50kmh).

Elsewhere, California-based Future Motion created a self balancing, one wheeled skateboard.

Called the Onewheel, the $1300 gadget can reach speeds on 12mph, and turn 360 degrees within the length of the board.

Aside from the time travelling Delorean and coveted hoverboard, the Back To The Future franchise featured another simpler, yet equally futuristic design - self-tying laces.

Nike released a limited range of McFly's Nike MAGs with manual laces in 2011, and now designer Tinker Hatfield has revealed the power laces will arrive in 2015.   

Hatfield made these comments because 2015 was the year Back To the Future II was set in. 

Without giving a release date, Tinker confirmed that his team is working as hard as possible to deliver the Nike MAG in 2015 with Power Laces, but also reminded us all that we still have '11 and two-thirds months left in 2015″, according to Nice Kicks.

'Are we going to see power laces in 2015? To that, I say yes.'

Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010 when Nike applied for a patent for 'automatically lacing trainers.'

It said: 'The automatic lacing
 system provides a set of straps that can be automatically opened and 
closed to switch between a loosened and tightened position of the upper.

'The
 article further includes an automatic ankle cinching system that is 
configured to automatically adjust an ankle portion of the upper.'

The Back To The Future-inspired Nike MAG range was then launched in 2011.

Only 1,500 models of the High Tops were made, and every pair was auctioned off on eBay.

A total of $6million (£3.5million) was raised from the sales of these shoes, and all the proceeds went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.

San Francisco-based inventor Blake Bevin has already created her own self-tying laces, a prototype which she says will 'tide you over until Nike comes out with something more polished.'

Self-lacing shoes EXIST: A Canadian Kickstarter campaign created Powerlace, the athletic shoes that automatically tighten to the wearer's foot. And Nike in 2011 created mock-ups of the cinematic shoes to be auctioned for charity. For 2015, the company has said it intends to create a version that actually lace themselves

Using an Arduino microcontroller, Bevin fitted a sensor to a Nike High Top.

When a person steps into the shoe, a force sensor reads the pressure of their foot and activates two servo motors, which apply tension to the laces, tightening the shoe.

A touch switch can be used to reverse the servos.

Nike also plans on selling power laces next year, according to designer Tinker Hatfield, which will be the same year in which the much loved film is set Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010, after which Nike released a range of Back To The Future-inspired High Tops, (pictured)
