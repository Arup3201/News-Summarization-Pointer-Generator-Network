Former Chelsea striker Kerry Dixon will stand trial charged with possessing cocaine.

Dixon, 53, pleaded not guilty to possession of the Class A drug when he appeared at Luton magistrates’ court.

Dixon, who scored 193 goals for the Stamford Bridge club, frequently appeared on the club’s in-house station, Chelsea TV, as a pundit.

Court appearance: Former Chelsea and England footballer Kerry Dixon arrives at Luton Magistrates Court, where he pleaded not guilty to possession of Class A drug cocaine 

On target: Dixon is Chelsea's third highest all-time goalscorer 

He is a popular figure at Stamford Bridge and began his career at non-League Chesham United, before he got his big break with Reading in 1980.

He went on to play for the Blues, Southampton, Luton, Millwall, Watford and Doncaster.

Dixon played eight times for England and scored twice in a 3-0 win over West Germany in 1985 when Bobby Robson’s squad were acclimatising to the conditions in Mexico ahead of the following year’s World Cup.

He will be at Luton crown court next month for a preliminary hearing.
