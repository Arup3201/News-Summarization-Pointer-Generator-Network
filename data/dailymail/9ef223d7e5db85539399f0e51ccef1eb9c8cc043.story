The ‘Great British Revival’ is at stake in the general election a year today, David Cameron warned last night.

With a poll showing Ukip doing the Tories serious damage, the Prime Minister urged supporters to stick with the Government’s economic plans.

Otherwise, he said, the Labour Party would take charge and spend and borrow more.

Tory strategists accept that many of their supporters will back Ukip as a protest in this month’s European poll – and must be brought back into the fold before the general election.

An analysis by YouGov showed that 42 per cent of those who voted Conservative in 2010 plan to back Ukip in the European elections this month.

Of 9,000 people questioned by the polling group, almost 2,000 said they would vote for the anti-European party if a general election were held now. Tory defectors outnumbered by three to two the Labour and Lib Dem defectors together.

YouGov’s Peter Kellner said: ‘Farage should not claim that his party is winning votes from Labour on anything like the scale that it is taking them from the Conservatives.’

The Prime Minister has told his MPs to brag about the success of policies aimed  at women.

At a private party meeting, David Cameron said the  Government had been ‘underselling’ its policies directed  at helping women. Since 2010, the number of women on

FTSE100 company boards had increased to 20.7 per cent and the gender pay gap was ‘almost eliminated for full-time workers under 40’, Women’s Minister Nicky Morgan told MPs.

The number of women  running small businesses had risen from 14 per cent to 20 per cent under the Coalition, Miss Morgan added. 

Yet despite the progress made, Mr Cameron told MPs and peers that ‘we have been underselling this ourselves’ in terms of women’s policies.

Former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, now a leading pollster, says Mr Cameron remains his party’s ‘biggest electoral asset’ but time is running out to persuade voters that he and his colleagues are on their side.

He argues that Ukip is ‘an ideal conduit for the blowing of mid-term raspberries’ but those who want their vote to count in 2015 will have to choose between the main parties.

Mr Cameron, who addressed MPs and peers with his chief election strategist Lynton Crosby last night, said: ‘The general election is one year away. For each of those 365 days, the Conservatives have one clear message: we are the team that is turning Britain around.

‘We have set out a serious, long-term economic plan: reducing the deficit, cutting income taxes, backing business, capping welfare, reducing immigration, delivering the best schools and skills – and that plan is working for families across our country.’

He said the deficit had been cut by over a third, the economy was one of the fastest growing in the developed world and 1.5million more people were in work.

He added: ‘Immigration is down. Welfare has been capped. And something I’m very proud of: today 250,000 fewer children are being taught in failing schools. All this means more peace of mind for families, more young people with the chance to get on in life, and more financial security.

‘From the ashes of the Great Recession we are building a Great British Revival. All this is at stake a year from now. Labour’s only plans are for more spending, more borrowing, more debt – more of the same that got us into the mess.’

Toward the end of the last parliament a cartoon showed a lady asking her husband: ‘Is it possible to be sick of an election before it’s started?’

Many will have the same thought long before we choose our next government, 365 days from today.For David Cameron, though, the year will feel terrifyingly short.

Last night the PM reassured his troops that they can take on Ukip – the biggest worry for many in the party – by reminding voters that only the Conservatives can deliver a referendum and real change.

Grumpy though some Tories are, they know Cameron remains their biggest electoral asset.

They also know there is no alternative; as my polling has shown, Boris is popular but no silver bullet.Cameron remains more popular than Ed Miliband and the Conservatives are more trusted than Labour to run the economy.

The Tories hope these things will matter more to voters as the decision gets closer. Meanwhile, jitters will grow if Labour’s lead persists.

It will take more than 12 months to change many voters’ view that the Tories are not on their side.

In the meantime, they must show more clearly what a national recovery could mean. My polling has found people are more likely to think a Tory government would benefit Britain than to believe it would be good for them.

Nick Clegg will also feel the year rushing by. To most voters the Lib Dems have betrayed their principles, or sunk without trace, or both. Achieving office has also cost them the votes of the none-of-the-above brigade, probably for good.

That means the Lib Dems must define a national purpose for themselves. This – though Tories blame them for thwarting their most beloved schemes – is proving a struggle.

They must hold on to as many as they can of the 57 seats they won in 2010 on perhaps half their former national vote share; perhaps more than any other party, their fate lies in the marginals.

Miliband will be counting down the days more impatiently. Labour’s current lead would see him comfortably into Downing Street. But he knows governing parties tend to recover ground in the months before an election.

He needs to show Labour have learned their lessons on the economy and that he has more to offer than complaints about how expensive everything is.

Labour have done little to allay the fear that they would spend more than the country can afford and undo what progress the coalition has made on things like tackling benefit dependency.

For Nigel Farage, too, May 7, 2015, cannot come soon enough. For Ukip, European elections bring attention by the truckload, but they have always marked the high points of success.

Though an ideal conduit for the blowing of mid-term raspberries, Farage will need to explain why Ukip are worth voting for when more is at stake.

Stickers are already printed bearing the legend ‘Don’t blame me, I voted UKIP’. Fine, for those who want to opt out of the decision. But what to say to people who want their vote to count?

All the parties have to contend with public weariness and cynicism – not just about the behaviour of politicians but over whether politics itself can do much to change things.

This threatens the established parties: in a world where governments seem to have so little power to solve problems and improve our lot, what does it matter who is in charge?

Conservative supporters know Cameron remains their 'biggest electoral asset' and they also know there is no alternative. Lord Ashcroft's polling suggests that despite the popularity of Boris Johnson, pictured, he is 'no silver bullet'.

How should the parties react to this attitude? Like this: show a bit of humility, keep things in proportion and treat the voters as grown-ups. Don’t overclaim, either about what you have done or what you can do.

Don’t tell people you’re going to change their world or that your opponents would shatter it.

Talk to people about the things they care about, rather than repeating what you hope they can be made to care about.

For the voters, it is going to be a long year. The first thing they will need persuading of is that it matters who wins.
