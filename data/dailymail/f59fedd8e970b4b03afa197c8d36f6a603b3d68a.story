Arsene Wenger lost the plot after Jose Mourinho’s unbeaten run against Arsenal increased to 12 games after Chelsea’s 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge.

The Arsenal manager insisted he had no regrets for the shove on Mourinho when his incredible Barclays Premier League clash erupted after just 20 minutes.

Wenger said: ‘I don’t regret it, what is there to regret? I want to go from A to B and someone (Mourinho) confronted me before I got to B without any sign of a welcome.’

It's the longest-running feud in the Premier League... but where did it start?  

Chelsea took the lead when Eden Hazard scored with a penalty and former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa for his ninth goal this season.

Wenger claimed Gary Cahill should have already been sent off for the foul on Alexis Sanchez that provoked the flare-up between the two technical areas.

The Arsenal chief, whose side are now a staggering nine points behind league leaders Chelsea, also claimed Oscar and Branislav Ivanovic should have been sent off.

Wenger will face no further action from the FA because it was dealt with at the time by referee Martin Atkinson and fourth official Jonathan Moss.

Wenger will also have to deal with an open show of dissent from Santi Cazorla and Jack Wilshere when they were substituted on Sunday.

Both shook their heads repeatedly at the decision when they walked off the pitch and again when they sat on the substitutes’ bench in the second half.

He said: ‘A red card for Cahill wouldn’t surprise you if you watched it again. I went to Sanchez to see how badly he was injured.

A one-man team? Chelsea are so much more than that this season. Those who believe the title race rests on the hamstrings of Diego Costa may have to reconsider after this.

For a good 75 minutes, Arsenal snuffed out Costa’s threat. It did not matter. Chelsea were still on course for victory, through the quite brilliant Eden Hazard.

‘Oscar was lucky to stay on the pitch with his repeated fouling and he was only booked in the 88th minute. He was purposely fouling. Then there is Ivanovic as well with bad fouls, but it’s down to the referee, not to me.

‘I trust you will all teach me the moral lessons over the next two weeks and I can accept that. I am long enough in the game to see things the right way. I don’t listen to what Mourinho says.

‘You would see if I really tried to push you, come on.’ 

On Sunday night, Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was undergoing neurological tests in a local hospital after he was forced off with concussion.

Courtois suffered the injury when he was caught accidentally in the head by Sanchez’s knee when he was clean through on goal in the tenth minute.

He continued but was substituted with blood pouring from his ear 14 minutes later and replaced by former Chelsea No 1 Petr Cech.

Courtois is in the Belgian squad for Euro 2016 qualifiers with Andorra on Friday and Bosnia the following week, but it seems unlikely that he will take part.

Mourinho said: ‘He has gone to hospital for a precaution, but we think nothing special will happen. 

‘On the bench I don't communicate with the doctors. I just get decisions. Can he stay? Yes. He has to leave? Okay. First they said yes he could continue, then no. I was just worried for the kid. 

‘I was not worried about the game or the performance: we have two of the three best keepers in the world, so when one is injured and comes off, no problem, no change in the team. I was confident that Petr would do a fantastic job for us.

‘We have Dr Biovksa, the head of the medical department, and he has his people. I always tell them that, when I'm on the bench, I don't want to communicate with them. I just want them to give me a decision. 

‘They gave me their decision. For me, that's correct. The club doctor or medical department should take control and responsibility.’ 

Mourinho, who failed to shake hands with Wenger at the final whistle, claimed there is no issue with the Arsenal manager after their latest heated skirmish.

The Chelsea manager said: ‘It becomes heated because it's a big game, big clubs, big rivals, an important match for both teams. ‘I think these conditions make a game of emotions. After that, there are two technical areas. One for me, one for him.

‘He was coming into my technical area and not for the right reasons, to give some technical instructions. He was coming to push the referee for a red card, and I didn't like that. But I think Moss did a good job.

‘A football pitch is a football pitch. Yes. He did well, Jonathan Moss. And Atkinson did well too. ‘But, to be fair, I do so many wrong things in football, sometimes you lose emotion, but not this time. This time I was just in my technical area and it was not my problem. Game over, story over.’
