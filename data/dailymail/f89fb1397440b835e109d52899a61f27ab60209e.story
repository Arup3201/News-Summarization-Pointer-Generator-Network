According to TMZ, Sugar Bear, also known as Mike Thompson, will be traveling the 90 minutes from his home in McIntyre to visit his daughter.

The photos from inside Mama June's new home reveal a bunk-bed with plenty of pink for Alana's new bedroom. 

There is also a self-portrait of the former beauty pageant star above the bed and posters from their reality show which was canceled in October. 

Cartoon owls adorn one bathroom while furniture still appears to be sparse throughout the rest of the house.

Mama June also revealed she will have strict new cleaning rules - no shoes inside and all the girls will have chores to keep the home in tip-top condition.

June and Mike were never technically married, but they did have a camouflage-clad commitment ceremony on May 5, 2013.

Shannon's four daughters - Anna aka 'Chickadee,' 20, Jessica aka 'Chubbs,' 18, Lauryn aka 'Pumpkin,' 15, and Alana aka 'Honey Boo Boo,' 9 - all have different fathers. 

Thompson lives in a mobile home with his brother while the mom and daughters new home cost $149,000.

After four seasons, TLC canceled Here Comes Honey Boo Boo on October 24 following reports that June had been involved with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel.
