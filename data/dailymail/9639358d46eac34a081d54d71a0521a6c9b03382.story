A mother branded a 'tramp' for breastfeeding her daughter in public has hit back at critics, arguing she was showing no more flesh than many scantily-clad women.

Emily Slough, 27, was horrified when a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter Matilda and uploaded it to Facebook, calling her a 'tramp'.

She had been out shopping last Friday when she stopped
 to feed the eight-month-old on the steps of a restaurant and 
have some lunch.

Emily Slough was out shopping last Friday when she stopped to feed her eight-month-old daughter Matilda on the steps of a restaurant and have some lunch. Unbeknown to her, a stranger had spotted her, taken a photo of her and posted it on Facebook, saying: 'I know the sun is out n all that but there's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town!!! Tramp'

Defiant: Emily Slough appeared on ITV's Daybreak to hit back at critics, arguing she was showing no more flesh than many scantily-clad women

Unbeknown to her, a stranger had spotted
 her, taken a photo of her and posted it on Facebook, saying: 'I know 
the sun is out n all that but there's no need to let your kid feast on 
your nipple in town!!! Tramp.'

Her story caused a storm online and she was even branded a 'peasant' by an 'etiquette expert' on a local radio show.

Mrs Slough, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, said she was 'shocked' when she discovered what had been said about her.

Appearing on ITV's Daybreak this morning, she hit back at critics, saying: 'I was showing a lot less flesh than a lot of people do - I wasn't sitting there with my breast out.

'Breastfeeding mums aren't doing it to antagonise people or gain attention - they are doing it to meet their babies' needs.

Mrs Slough said: 'Breastfeeding mums aren't doing it to gain attention - they are doing it to meet their babies' needs'

Hungry: Mrs Slough's eight-month-old daughter, Matilda. Her mother said: 'I was just out shopping and on my way home, my baby needed feeding - and breast fed babies are fed on demand'

'I was just out shopping on and on my way home, my baby needed feeding - and breast fed babies are fed on demand, obviously.'

When asked by the presenters if she 
would do what some people suggest and feed Matilda in public toilets, 
she replied 'definitely not'.

She
 added: 'I have had some some people say they think breastfeeding in public is undignified, but I
 think it's very undignified to go into the toilet to feed your baby.'

Earlier this week, she said: 'Why
 should mothers who are doing the best by their children feel that they 
should be confined to a toilet or changing room to provide their baby 
with nutrients?

'Would you eat in a toilet or with a blanket draped over your face?'

Anger: When asked by the presenters if she would do what some people suggest and feed Matilda in public toilets, she replied 'definitely not'

And regarding comments about her sitting on a pub step to breastfeed, she said today: 'Where I was sitting was pretty private - it was quite out of the way. you had to look pretty hard to notice - it was pretty discreet.'

Despite this, a stranger still managed to take a picture of her - and by the time she got home, a friend had alerted her to the fact it had been posted on the local Spotted Rugeley website.

When asked how she felt to be called a tramp, she said: 'I think when things are anonymous people get brave, and can put what they like with no repercussions.'

In response to the stinging attack, Mrs Slough has organised a peaceful breastfeeding protest in the town this Saturday.

The hashtag #rugeleymassfeed has hundreds of posts on Twitter and similar events by other supporters are 
planned to take place in York and Swansea.

Sympathetic: Her campaign to support mothers has garnered huge public support under the hashtag #rugeleymassfeed

Her campaign to support mothers 
has garnered huge public support and the Facebook event to publicise the
 breastfeeding meet-up, at 12pm on Market Street on Saturday, now has 
more than 1,200 listed as attending.

She said earlier this week: 'I am very confident and comfortable with my breastfeeding, but I know plenty who aren't and don't even humour the idea of nursing because of some ridiculous stigma attached to it and fear of embarrassment, humiliation and non-acceptance.'

Upon announcing the protest, she wrote on
 Facebook: 'I was initially going to ignore the post and laugh it off, 
but then I realised that this is a perfect example of what needs to be 
erased in modern day society.'

Mrs Slough said: 'The mentality of the individual that attempted to shame me for feeding my daughter makes me so angry'

She added: 'I'd like to personally 
thank whoever took the photograph and allowing those in support of 
breastfeeding mothers whenever and wherever to make a stand and unite 
against this kind of discrimination.'

The National Childbirth Trust condemned the picture and comments. CEO Belinda Phipps said: 'This 
behaviour is dreadful. For good reason, mothers feeding their babies are
 protected by law.

'The
 Equality Act, of October 2010, states that it is unlawful for mums to 
be discriminated against or treated unfavourably because they are 
breastfeeding in England, Wales or Scotland.

'Whether
 formula feeding or breastfeeding, it is important that mums are able to
 feed their baby whenever and wherever they need it.

'Any mother who chooses to breastfeed her baby should have the right to do so without harassment.'
