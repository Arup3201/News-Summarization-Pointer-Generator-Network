The parents of an American aid worker who has been captured by ISIS and threatened with beheading have released an emotional letter he wrote them while captured by the extremists.

Abdul-Raham Kassig, from Indianapolis, was seized by the terror group a year ago while giving aid to Syrians - and was singled out in their latest gory execution video as their next victim.

Paula and Ed Kassig, the 26-year-old's mother and father,  today revealed parts of a letter they received from him which speaks of his fear at the prospect of becoming ISIS's next victim.

Emotional plea: Ed and Paula Kassig (above) released parts of the heartfelt letter they received from their son on June 2 this year

Kassig, a former U.S. Army Ranger, converted to Islam in captivity. He was formerly known as Peter, but his family have asked media outlets to refer to him by his Islamic name, Abdul-Rahman. 

But it also implores his parents to 'take comfort' in the fact that it was his commitment to helping other people that led to him being captured.

In the message he says: 'I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all.

'I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through. If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.'

'I wish this paper would go on forever and never run out and I could just keep talking to you. Just know I’m with you.'

The Kassig family received the letter on June 2, but have only just made parts of it public, along with two photographs of him growing up.

They also issued a statement explaining how he converted to Islam, a process which they say had already begun when he was taken hostage.

They say he had come to 'admire and respect' the Syrian Muslims he was helping, and had fasted during Ramadan in July and August 2013.

A former hostage told them he had converted fully by December 2013, at which point he took on a new name and began praying five times a day.

In his letter he wrote: 'In terms of my faith, I pray everyday and I am not angry about my situation in that sense. I am in a dogmatically complicated situation here, but I am at peace with my belief.'

His parents, who have already released a video pleading for mercy from ISIS, then repeated their message, and also said that they disagree with the U.S. government's actions against the group.

They wrote: 'We ask the world to continue to pray for him and for all innocent people harmed by violence and war. We continue to pressure the government to stop its actions and continue to call on his captors to have mercy and release him.'

Kassig first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier before returning as a medical worker to help victims of war.

While in Turkey, he founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a medically-oriented emergency relief group that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons.

It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, when he was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria.

On Friday he was threatened with death in a chilling video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning.

He was shown kneeling in the desert at the end of the footage, which saw a masked militant tell President Barack Obama that U.S. 'aerial bombardments' are putting them under strain.

The militant added: 'It's only right we continue to strike the necks of your people.

The beheading of Henning yesterday followed the murders of three other hostages in similar circumstance: U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.

U.S. officials have confirmed that Mr Kassig is being held by Islamic State militants, but have declined to give any more details of his capture.

After the video surfaced, President Obama strongly condemned the killing and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice.

'Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family and the people of the United Kingdom,' he said in a statement.

'Standing together with our U.K. friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice.'

The President added that the U.S. and other nations will continue to take action to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the Islamic State group.

This is the letter that Paula and Ed Kassig received from their son in captivity. Before it was released the text was edited for length and sensitive information redacted:

'The first thing I want to say is thank you. Both to you and mom for everything you have both done for me as parents; for everything you have taught me, shown me, and experienced with me.

'I cannot imagine the strength and commitment it has taken to raise a son like me but your love and patience are things I am so deeply grateful for.

'I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all.

'I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through.

'If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.

'In terms of my faith, I pray everyday and I am not angry about my situation in that sense. I am in a dogmatically complicated situation here, but I am at peace with my belief.

'I wish this paper would go on forever and never run out and I could just keep talking to you. Just know I’m with you.

'Every stream, every lake, every field and river. In the woods and in the hills, in all the places you showed me. I love you.'
