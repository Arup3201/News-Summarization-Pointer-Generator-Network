Cait Reilly, pictured, yesterday asked the High Court to declare the Government¿s back-to-work programme unlawful

A graduate made to work for her jobless benefits as a shelf stacker in Poundland yesterday claimed the scheme amounted to ‘forced labour’ which breached her human rights.

Cait Reilly yesterday asked the High Court to declare the Government’s back-to-work programme unlawful after she was required to work in the budget store or risk losing her £53.45-a-week jobseeker’s allowance.

The 23-year-old said she had to give up a voluntary post in a museum to take the placement but was promised a job interview if she completed two weeks training at Poundland. However, she says, that never materialised.

The Government is fighting her claim 
and strongly denies that its flagship work programme, which has placed 
thousands of jobseekers on unpaid placements since its launch last year,
is equivalent to ‘slave labour’.

Unemployed
mechanic Jamieson Wilson, 41, is also challenging the legality of 
another Government work scheme that compels the jobless to take unpaid 
work.

Lawyers for the pair 
are seeking a judicial review into the Department for Work and Pensions 
programme, saying it violates Article 4 of the European Convention on 
Human Rights, which prohibits forced labour and slavery.

The
schemes, championed by Employment Minister Chris Grayling, aim to help 
250,000 young people over the next two years through training and unpaid
experience in the public, private and charity sectors. 
Placement-providers include chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Argos and
Asda.

Miss Reilly, who graduated in geology 
from Birmingham University in 2010, was placed on the scheme after 
attending a retail jobs ‘open day’ in October last year at the 
suggestion of her Jobcentre Plus adviser. 

Legal challenge: Cait Reilly, pictured, was 'forced' to leave her voluntary work at a museum to stack shelves at Poundland or risk losing her benefits

Only after attending was she told she had to undertake a period of training or risk losing her benefits.

Nathalie Lieven, QC, appearing for 
Miss Reilly, said her placement at Poundland, near her home in Kings 
Heath, Birmingham, involved carrying out ‘menial’ tasks, adding: ‘Such 
work did not contribute to (Miss Reilly’s) search for work to any 
extent.’

Miss Reilly had undertaken the work under ‘menace of penalty’ in breach of her human rights, she added.

The court was told Poundland is a successful firm with a net turnover of £500million, and her placement did not contribute to the public interest.

Miss Lieven told Mr Justice Foskett the way in which the back-to-work programme was administered was ‘blatantly unlawful’, and had put thousands at risk of unfairly losing their benefits.

She also accused the Government of ‘seemingly sub-delegating to private sector providers’ how the schemes were run, including whether those who refused unpaid work should lose benefits.

Miss Lieven added: ‘These claimants have an entitlement to subsistence-level benefits.

'Taking away these subsistence-level benefits for up to six months is in many ways just as fundamental as being detained as an immigrant in prison.’

The court heard that Mr Wilson, also from the Midlands, had been unemployed since 2008.

He was told last November he would be required to undertake up to six months of unpaid work cleaning furniture.

After refusing, he had his benefits cut, and now faces the loss of his jobseeker’s allowance for six months.

Paul Nicholls, QC, appearing for the DWP, argued that both legal challenges were ‘wrong in law’.

He said the purpose of the schemes was to assist the long-term jobless to better equip themselves for work, and thousands of people in different situations had benefited.

The case continues.
