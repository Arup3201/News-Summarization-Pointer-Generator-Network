Rio Ferdinand will return to training on Tuesday after missing QPR’s defeat at Burnley because of a tight groin.

The Rangers centre back was forced to pull out of the clash at Turf Moor just before the players boarded a train on Friday afternoon with the niggling injury.

Ferdinand played in last week’s FA Cup defeat by Sheffield United but was forced out of the 2-1 loss to Sean Dyche’s team.

Although the injury isn’t serious he was advised to stay at home to or rest over the weekend.

He will return to training on Tuesday and will be in contention for Saturday’s clash at Loftus Road in the Barclays Premier League against Manchester United.

Harry Redknapp's side currently occupy 19th place in the Premier League standings.
