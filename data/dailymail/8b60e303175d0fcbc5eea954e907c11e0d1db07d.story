Razor blades planted in the grass at a San Diego playground have injured two brothers who played barefoot, sparking fears of copycat pranks.

Cassie Padilla called police when her seven-year-old son Tristen stepped on a blade and her 15-year-old son Daniel was grazed by another, at Bonita Cove Park on Mariners Way about 7pm last night.

As paramedics pulled the razor out of Tristen's foot, police officers scoured the park with metal detectors and found 19 blades sticking out of the grass - many around a picnic table and bench.

San Diego Police Department Lt. Paul Phillips said officers are hunting the 'sick' vandals who deliberately planted the blades, in what is becoming an increasingly common prank.

'The first thing that would come to mind is sickness and frustration,' Lt. Phillips told CBS News 8. 'Can you imagine with children around here? This is not a prank this is a sickness or someone who has an evil mind.'

The Padilla family were enjoying a picnic with relatives at the park last night when the boys were injured.

'It's pretty crazy. His (Tristen's razor blade) was probably sticking up. It's really bad,' mom-of-two Cassie Padilla told ABC 10 News.

She said after Tristen's accident, her older son Daniel stepped on a blade but the nick wasn't serious.

Paramedics bandaged Danie's foot at the scene before his mother took him to UCSD Medical Center for stitches.

'I think that's crazy that anyone would do that,' Cassie Padilla said.

Lt. Phillips said police will analyze the razor blades to find any evidence and vowed to catch copycats.

Collecting evidence: Police meticulously scoured Bonita Cove Park for razor blades pushed in the grass, placing markers at the spots where they were found

CBS News 8 reported police were 
called to Bonita Cove Park three times last year to find razor blades 
purposely planted in the grass, the playground and sandbox.

According to UT San Diego, a woman cut her foot on a razor blade while walking through grass near one of the playgrounds last August. Eight blades were found in the area.

Several
 weeks later, about 20 razor blades were found in a park area across the
 street from the first location, but no one was injured.

Scene: Most of the blades were planted around this table at Bonita Cove Park, where the Padilla family were enjoying a picnic

Copycat offense: Police were called to San Diego's Bonita Cove Park at least three times last year following reports vandals had left razor blades near the playground, sand box and in the grass

Reports of vandals planting blades around playgrounds and parks across America have become increasingly common, with authorities urging families to keep a close eye on where their children are playing.Â 

In Illinois last month, a two-year-old boy cut himself on blades which vandals had glued to the playground monkey bars, slide and ground. Authorities found a dozen blades stuck to the equipment with a putty-like adhesive.

Earlier this month, razor blades were found duct-taped to playground equipment at Eaton Park, outside Philadelphia.
