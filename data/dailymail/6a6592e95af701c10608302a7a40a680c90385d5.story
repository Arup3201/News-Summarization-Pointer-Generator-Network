Louis van Gaal has admitted it would be a 'miracle' if Manchester United won the Barclays Premier League this season.

The Dutchman compared the current situation at Old Trafford to when he took over an imbalanced squad at Bayern Munich in 2009.

But while Van Gaal did go on an win the Bundesliga during his first campaign with the German giants, he concedes it is unlikely he'll be able to repeat the trick at United.

Long way off: Louis van Gaal has admitted it would take a 'miracle' for Manchester United to win the title

Poor start: United lost 2-1 at home to Swansea City on the opening weekend 

No repeat: Van Gaal won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich in his first season with the club but he doesn't believe the same thing will happen at United

The scale of his task was underlined last weekend when United were beaten at home by Swansea City on the opening day and they travel to Sunderland on Sunday in desperate need of a win.

Asked whether he should be judged on his second season in Manchester as opposed to his first, Van Gaal replied: 'That is always the case.

'What I have experienced is that I was champion in Barcelona and in Germany, so it is possible but it is very difficult.

'When I got to Bayern Munich the [squad] selection was not stable. What we did was a miracle.

'Now here the selection is not in balance. There are five No 9s and six No 10s and so on. And we don't have defenders.'

Positive start: Ander Herrera has impressed since his move from Bilbao but is out injured for Sunderland

Incoming: United signed Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo this week for £16m 

Transfer target: United are close to a deal for the Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria

When asked directly if it would take a 'miracle' to win the Premier League this season, he said: 'Yes I think so. It is always possible but it shall be very difficult.'

Van Gaal will be with the injured Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw for the trip to the Stadium of Light, while Rafael and Danny Welbeck are doubtful.

New £16m signing Marcos Rojo has yet to receive his work permit following his move from Sporting Lisbon and so is unavailable.

United are inching closer to the £60m signing of Angel Di Maria from Real Madrid, with further progress expected on Sunday.
