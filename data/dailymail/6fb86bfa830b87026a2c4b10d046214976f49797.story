The NBA wants the Sterling name scrubbed from Clippers ownership, at least according to superstar LeBron James.

The Miami Heat forward said Sunday that no players want to play for either Donald Sterling, estranged wife Shelley Sterling, or any other member of the family.

‘As players, we want what's right and we don't feel like no one in his family should be able to own the team,’ he told the Miami Herald following an afternoon practice.

James’ comments came at about the same time an interview aired on ABC News with Shelley Sterling saying she’d fight to keep her ownership stake in the Clippers intact even if Donald Sterling is forced by the league to sell his half.

‘I will fight,’ she told Barbara Walters. ‘To be honest with you, I'm wondering if a wife of one of the owners, and there's 30 owners, did something like that, said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband? Or would they leave the husband in?’

James strongly criticized Sterling after the now-infamous recordings of him ranting racial slurs at V Stiviano were made public last month by TMZ and Deadspin.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver last week banned Donald Sterling from the NBA for life and suggested he sell the team, but wife Shelley Sterling has been an outsized presence at the team’s home playoff games since.

An owner’s committee voted only two days later to expedite the sale of the team and the league appointed former General Motors executive Dick parsons to run the team until it is sold.

Donald Sterling has said he would fight any attempt to sell his interest in the team, and James said the league is up to the challenge.

‘At the end of the day, this is going to be a long litigation when it comes to that,’ James said. ‘This guy who's owned the team since the '80s is not going to just give the team up in a day. So we understand it's going to be long, but we want what's right.’

Donald Sterling bought the Clippers in 1981, he is the league’s longest-tenured owner.
