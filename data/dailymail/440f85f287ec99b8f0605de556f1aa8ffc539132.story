A family was killed when  a crisp packet blocked a chimney and deadly fumes filled their lounge, an inquest has heard.

Trevor Wallwork, 50, and his children Kimberley, 12, and Harry, nine, were watching TV when an empty crisp packet was thrown on to the coal fire.

It rose up ‘like a hot air balloon’ and then blocked the chimney, which prevented fumes from the coal fire from escaping.

Lethal gases seeped back into the living room and the family was slowly overcome by carbon monoxide as they watched television.

Family: Mr Wallwork, from Swinton, near Salford and second wife Susan Wallwork, 52, left England in 2004 to move to a bungalow known as Forget Me Not Cottage in Gurteen in County Sligo, Ireland

Their bodies were discovered the next 
day after Mr Wallwork failed to drop off the children ahead of a planned
visit to his terminally ill wife Susan, 52, in hospital.

At a Bolton inquest into their deaths a
coroner said the accident was ‘unimaginable and unexpected’ and was one
of the worst tragedies he had come across.

Mr Wallwork, who was 
originally from Swinton in Salford, was married to his second wife Susan
for six years before the tragedy unfolded in Co. Sligo, Ireland, in 
December 2011.

The family moved there about six or 
seven years ago, after Mr Wallwork divorced his first wife Donna 
Farrimond, the children’s mother, who is disabled and lives in Wigan.

Chief Fire Officer for Sligo Paul 
Coyle said an investigation of the property discovered a blockage close 
to the top of the chimney.

He told the court through a statement 
that he concluded a ‘coincidental and incredible’ set of circumstances 
were responsible for the deaths.

The amount of carbon monoxide in the 
room would have risen quickly to ‘very dangerous’ levels as the family 
sat there unaware.

The bodies of Mr Wallwork and his 
children were found the next day when his step-daughter, Vicky, arrived 
after failing to get any response by phone.

After repeatedly banging on doors and 
windows of the bungalow in Gurteen, she saw Mr Wallwork unresponsive in 
an armchair with the children on the floor and the television and 
Christmas lights still on.

Mrs Wallwork, who was in hospital being 
treated for cancer at the time, died about six months later. Pathologist
Dr Michael Curtis said the cause of all three deaths was carbon 
monoxide poisoning with high levels detected in the blood.

Coroner Alan Walsh recorded verdicts 
of accidental death and added: ‘I have found it to be one of the most 
tragic cases I have heard in the court after sitting here for 12 years.’

After the hearing, Mr Wallwork’s brother-in-law Arthur Flather said: 
‘Trevor was a devoted dad, brother, son and uncle.

‘He was much-loved and the children 
were gorgeous and their teachers both in Ireland and England said how 
well-behaved they were. As a family we want to encourage people to fit 
carbon monoxide poisoning detectors.’

Hearing: Donna Farrimond, ex-wife of Trevor Wallwork, and mother of their children Kimberley and Harry Wallwork, outside Bolton Coroner's Court

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, poisonous gas produced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal.

When CO enters the body, it prevents the blood from bringing oxygen to cells, tissues, and organs.

Around 11 people die from CO poisoning each year in the UK - according to the Heath Safety Executive.

Symptoms include headaches or dizziness, breathlessness, nausea, loss of consciousness and tiredness.

Carbon Monoxide can be produced by any combustion appliance, including those that burn fossil fuels such as oil, wood and coal.

If you have one of these appliances you should make sure that it is serviced and maintained by a competent person and the chimney is regularly swept.
