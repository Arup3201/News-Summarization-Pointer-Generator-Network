Evans, who first found fame with his energetic, slapstick stage shows, has appeared in the theatre and films including There's Something About Mary.

On the show, which will air tomorrow, he told Ross the death of his manager, Addison Cresswell, had 'put things in perspective'. 

He said: 'I don't know, I've come to a junction in my life where - please forgive me it sounds very narcissistic - I've done musicals and plays and films and stand up and you sort of get to a point where you go "I don't know what else to do next".'

He added: 'I want to go and see my wife, she deserves my time, I've been working solidly.'  

Ross asked how long the planned to carry on in his job, to which he replied: 'I am knackered. This is it. Finished. This is the end. I am not doing anything.'

He said another reason for his departure was the death of his manager Addison Creswell, who died after suffering a heart attack last year.

'All I have ever done is work and Addison always used to put his arm around me and say, "Don't worry, I will look after you. It is okay",' he said.

 'My dad always said to me, "You have got to work" so I constantly worked and did comedy tours.

'I think I have ignored for far too long my missus, and I want to spend a lot more time with her.'
