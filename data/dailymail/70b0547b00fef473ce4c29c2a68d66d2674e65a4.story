Kit Symons is expected to be confirmed as Fulham manager this week.

The caretaker boss has overseen five wins in eight games to lift Fulham out of the relegation zone and chairman Shahid Khan is due to fly in from America next week to make the appointment official.

Symons said: 'I'm very confident I'll get it, it has to be getting more difficult, with the team winning games, for the five-man panel not to see the obvious thing to do for this football club.

'The owner [Shahid Khan] is over the week after next. 

'I don't know when a decision will be made or how it will come about. Hopefully we'll find out sooner rather than later.'

Fulham moved away from the relegation zone with a 3-0 win over Charlton on Friday night.
