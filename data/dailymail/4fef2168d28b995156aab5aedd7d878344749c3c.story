Bridget Jones fans reacted with sadness and fury when it was revealed that the beloved character  Mr Darcy had been killed off in Helen Fielding's latest novel, Mad About The Boy.

Now the author has revealed why she felt her heroine had to find herself suddenly single again at the age of 51 with two children.

She explains in a video you can watch below: 'I
 wrote this book from the inside out, that is what happened, Mark died. No-one gets to Bridget's age without suffering some sort of loss, life 
doesn't turn out as you expect.'

'Life doesn't turn out as you expect': Author Helen Fielding explains why character Mark Darcy is dead in her latest Bridget Jones novel

No happy ending: Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger, is a widow following the loss of Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth

The 55-year-old British writer said she also had to do something to make the book sufficiently different from the previous two novels in which hapless Bridget finally found love with the dashing lawyer. 

'I didn't want this book to be a 
weak copy of the other books,' she said.

And despite the sad subject matter of Bridget becoming a widow, Fielding said the book is still funny and uplifting.

Daniel is back: Fielding said she kept the character played by Hugh Grant, right, because 'an ex can become a friend'

'The thing about Bridget is the comedy
 has always come from something real,' she explained. 'Tough things happen in life and she gets 
through and she survives, she had her friends, she deals with it and she
 comes through the other side and she's still finding things funny.

'It 
hurts but she's still laughing, that was something important that I 
wanted to say.'

But while Mr Darcy - who was played by Colin Firth - in the films will only be referred to in flashbacks in the new book, Fielding was keen to ensure the character Daniel Cleaver still had a starring role.

He was the lovable rogue who cheated on Bridget and almost cost her her happy relationship with Darcy. So it is plausible they would still be friends decades later?

Fielding believes so. 'The
 thing about Daniel is, people do stay in people's lives, old boyfriends
 do become friends.

Not all sad: Fielding said the new novel still has humour despite the loss of Bridget's husband

Still mad about Bridget: The book has been selling well despite poor reviews

'He's still Daniel saying "what colour are your 
panties" and having a crack at seduction but he's still in her life and
 they accept each other as they are.'

Fielding concedes his inclusion is also because she has a soft spot for the character - which was increased after Hugh Grant played him so charmingly in the film adaptations, adding his own improvised lines to the script.

She said: 'I love Daniel as a character and I 
love Hugh as a character. Hugh contributed a huge amount to the funny 
lines in the movie.

'For example when he's seducing Bridget and she's 
wearing the big pants, and he says "don't worry, I'm wearing something 
similar myself" and "oh mummy!" that came from him.

'So I really wanted to 
keep him present and he's now godfather to Bridget's children.'

Despite some mediocre reviews and the loss of Mr Darcy, Mad About The Boy has still been snapped up by readers, topping the hardback chart the week it went on sale.
