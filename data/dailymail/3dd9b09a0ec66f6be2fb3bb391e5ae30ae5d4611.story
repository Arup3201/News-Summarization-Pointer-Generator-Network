A missing Wisconsin woman whom it was feared had been kidnapped - and was scheduled to graduate from college just days after her disappearance - is now a suspect in the May 7 robbery of the bank at which she worked, authorities now say.

Jessica Benson, 22, and her boyfriend, Nathaniel Robinson, have been missing since May 11, when she called in sick to her job at a Milwaukee Educator's Credit Union bank, which was the target of the robbery just days earlier - while Benson was working.

The couple hasn't been heard from since.

The robbery occurred at the bank's drive-thru teller. Authorities say the suspects passed the teller a note demanding cash. The note, authorities say, contained terminology used internally by the bank, which is why authorities suspect an employee had some role in planning the heist.

Two men, 25-year-old Kevin Blackburn and 31-year-old Ricardo Perkins, already have been arrested in connection with the robbery.

According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, authorities conducted a welfare check of an apartment Benson shared with Robinson on May 14, and found it to be empty. When Robinson's parole officer had visited the apartment on May 3, it was fully furnished.

Neighbors told police they had seen the couple moving things into a U-Haul truck in the days prior - or the days after - the robbery.

During the week of the robbery, authorities say Benson had been using a rental car for daily tasks. Surveillance footage shows her returning the car - while being followed by a U-Haul truck and another vehicle - on May 13.

A search warrant for the rental car revealed that a witness told authorities 'Jessica Benson and Nathaniel Robinson planned the robbery of the Educators Credit Union.'

Benson's sister, Judith Beyer, isn't sure what to believe.

'Is there a possibly that he (Benson’s boyfriend) does have something to
do with it?' Beyer told Milwaukee's Fox6Now.com. 'Yes, and I believe that he did influence her 
to do something that would be outside of his characteristics and she’s 
still being held against her will.'

Police say the investigation into the robbery - and Benson's disappearance - is ongoing. The 22-year-old's family says it plans to continue holding vigils for her safe return.
