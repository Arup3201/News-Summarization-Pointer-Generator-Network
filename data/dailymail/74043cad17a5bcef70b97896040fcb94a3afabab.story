Andrew Sadler - who taught French at Rurik Jutting's £6,600-a-term boarding school in Worcestershire in the 1990s - is today revealed by the Mail as a convicted sex offender who was caught in bed with two child prostitutes in Romania

A teacher at 'psycho' banker Rurik Jutting’s prep school is a convicted sex offender who was caught in bed with two child prostitutes, it can be revealed today.

Andrew Sadler, who taught French at £6,600-a-term Abberley Hall in Worcestershire when Jutting was a pupil there in the early 1990s, was also a key member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE). 

Jutting is accused of slaughtering two prostitutes in Hong Kong last week in an unexplained act of savagery.

Later jailed in Romania for sexually assaulting boys, Sadler was described as the ‘quartermaster’ of PIE – the vile web of paedophiles that at one stage was linked to three of Labour’s most senior figures, including deputy leader Harriet Harman.

It was his ‘job’ within PIE to help co-ordinate other abusers in their ceaseless search for the world’s most vulnerable children. 

Sadler – who was caught in bed with two child prostitutes in Romania - also ran the Colts football team at Abberley.

Police believe Sadler – who confessed to a colleague of having ‘sex with hundreds and hundreds’ of boys – was an associate of PIE leaders including its treasurer Charles Napier and founder-member Morris Fraser.

PIE, which in the 1970s lobbied for sex between adults and children to be decriminalised, helped paedophiles to secretly pass around their young victims.

By the time Sadler quit teaching in 1995, Jutting, then aged ten, had been a boarder at Abberley for two years.

Sadler was never charged with abusing any children at Abberley and there has been no suggestion that Jutting was among his victims.

Sadler was reported to police in 1995 and took ‘early retirement’ from the historic school, which counts Lord (Geoffrey) Howe among its former pupils.

In 2000, when Sadler was imprisoned for four years in Romania, his sickening double-life was finally exposed.

British police who helped the Romanians convict him described Sadler as a key member of a network of public school paedophiles.

Blue-eyed Sadler, 64, who now lives 100 yards from another prep school, told the Mail last night: ‘Yes, I was a teacher at Abberley, but I don’t know [Jutting]. I didn’t teach him and I don’t recognise him from the photograph.’  

Asked about his paedophile activities, he said: ‘It has all been a terrible misunderstanding. I have been fighting to clear my name for 14 years. 

'I am the subject of a SOPO [Sexual Offences Prevention Order] which prevents me from associating with boys under 18 and I have to notify the police if I leave the country.’

He said he had previously visited other countries including Hong Kong, adding: ‘I have been to all over that part of the world as a teacher.

'There is a lot of poverty, which is why a lot of these girls go into prostitution - I have to say with their parents’ knowledge.’ 

Sadler was convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old boy and engaging in an obscene act in the presence of a juvenile at a court in Bucharest in 2000.

He spent 16 months of a four-year sentence in jail in Romania before being deported back to Britain on medical grounds.

In 2007, he then breached an interim court order not to have children under 18 at his home after he allowed a 15-year-old to smoke cannabis, drink beer and stay overnight.

Worcester Crown Court heard Sadler had employed an 18-year-old gardener who brought the youth along to his house.

In a failed attempt to appeal the ban, Sadler maintained he was only 'helping' a vulnerable boy who was having problems with his parents, it was reported by Worcester News at the time.

Sadler had claimed the order was 'unjust' telling the court: 'I have never gone near a child in my life.

'I’m not a paedophile and think the whole subject is abhorrent. I was helping the boy purely out of compassion.'

Quashing his appeal, Judge Andrew Geddes said: 'It is highly probable the boy was at his home to be groomed for sexual ventures. It is a very similar situation to the one in Romania.'

Sadler was subsequently given a full SOPO that also banned him from working with children under 16.

Speaking to the Mail yesterday, Michael Haggard, former headmaster of Abberley Hall school, said: ‘There was never any suggestion that Sadler had done anything wrong while at the school. 

'I have no reason to think that anything happened.’  

He described Jutting as ‘a highly intelligent and respected chap’, adding: ‘He excelled in academics but he also did a lot of other things. 

'He played musical instruments and was in lots of sport teams. He got on well with his peers and teachers. 

'He was very intelligent and got a scholarship to Winchester College, which is not a terribly easy thing to do.’

Police in Hong Kong are expected to carry out a video reconstruction of the alleged murders at Cambridge-educated Jutting’s high-rise apartment in the near future.

The former Merrill Lynch banker has been asked to take part in the exercise, ahead of his next court appearance on Monday.

Yesterday, it was claimed that just hours after allegedly butchering his first victim, Jutting went for a pint of beer at a local pub where he had previously told staff and drinkers he was ‘a psychopath’.

Police believe he chopped up Sumarti Ningshi, a 25-year-old mother-of-one from Indonesia, on October 27 before stuffing her ‘almost decapitated’ body into a suitcase.

Jutting is then said to have arrived at the Old China Hand pub in the Wan Chai red light district between 10pm and midnight that day.   

A member of staff said he came in and ordered a pint of Tetley’s.

He added Jutting – whose email out-of-office reply read: ‘Please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath’ – revealed he had just quit his job at Merrill Lynch but said little else.

Previously, Jutting had told people in the pub he liked ‘wild Indonesian girls’.

‘He kept telling everybody he was a psychopath - psychopathic. I didn’t take it seriously,’ the pub employee told the Telegraph.

Miss Ningshi’s decomposing corpse was found five days later when Jutting called police after allegedly killing a second sex worker, 32-year-old Seneng Mujiasih, known as Jesse.

Seneng’s 55-year-old mother Juminem told the Mail yesterday her daughter’s killer ‘must die the same way that Seneng died'. 

She added: 'He must die with the knife. It must be plunged into him time and again, so that he suffers and then dies. An eye for an eye.’
