Australian shoppers will splurge more than $2 billion on retail therapy if Boxing Day sale predictions pan out.

Retailers expect shops around the country will take in more than $16 billion over the next three weeks, including a $2.072 billion boon on Boxing Day alone.

If so, it would be the first time Australian shoppers have spent more than $2 billion in a single day.

Victorian consumers will lead the post-Christmas shopping binge according to the Australian Retailers Association, spending about $682 million on Boxing Day while NSW is expected to fork out $584 million.

ARA executive director Russell Zimmerman slammed 'ludicrous' retail regulations in New South Wales (NSW) preventing shops outside the city's CBD from opening their doors early on Boxing Day.

'NSW is Australia's most populous state, and yet Victoria easily takes the cake when it comes to expected Boxing Day sales,' Mr Zimmerman said on Thursday.

'This equals a $98 million loss of trade to NSW retailers, with absurd and outdated trading restrictions largely to blame.'
