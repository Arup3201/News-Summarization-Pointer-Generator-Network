Domino's has combined two fast food favorites into an indulgent and mouth-watering new dish: chicken crust pizza.

'Specialty Chicken' is made with 12 pieces of breaded, boneless chicken as a base and topped with pizza add-ons like cheese, sauces, vegetables and meats.

MailOnline gamely sampled each of the four different flavors - crispy bacon and tomato, classic hot buffalo, spicy jalapeno-pineapple and sweet barbecue bacon - ahead of its April 21 release, and the verdicts were overwhelmingly positive.

The ultimate combination: Domino's has combined two fast food favorites into an indulgent new dish called Specialty Chicken, which consists of breaded chicken bites with pizza cheese and toppings

'I think their focus group is a brilliant bunch of college kids,' surmised U.S. editor Katherine. 'I want to order this at 2am after a night of drinking. It would be heaven.'

She added that the standout 'by far' was the jalapeno and pineapple flavor. 'It's sweet and spicy and I would eat three boxes of it.'

Femail editor Tamara agreed. 'Not much can fail to be improved by melted cheese, and this rule is true of breaded chicken,' she said.

'The buffalo flavor was an easy favorite, ditto the barbecue sauce version. The pineapple jalapeno was a surprise hit though. It's so retro, but somehow it works.'

Indeed, spicy jalapeno-pineapple was the flavor that really won over the office, followed by the sweet barbecue bacon, although some complained that this one could use some improvement.

'The barbeque chicken was really good and I would happily order it and eat it,' said Katherine. 'But it is a bit messier, since it's saucier, and could benefit from more cheese.'

On the menu: It comes in four different flavors - crispy bacon and tomato, classic hot buffalo, spicy jalapeno-pineapple and sweet barbecue bacon

She also noted that Domino's could venture even further into chicken menu items by producing more varieties of this new dish.

'They should offer a grilled option as well,' she said. 'The breading wasn't that integral. And I'm sure people cutting carbs or allergic to gluten will celebrate this alternative way to pig out on pizza flavors.'

Photo editor Robert also suggested toning down the bread crumbs, which 'could help the flavor of the sauce and chicken come through'.

More like a box of chicken fingers than a pizza pie, Specialty Chicken is 'one of the most creative, innovative menu items we have ever had,' said Russell Weiner, Domino's Pizza chief marketing officer.

'Our pizza chefs have taken chicken to a whole new level, using our unique ingredients to create these four bold flavors. There's nothing quite like Domino's Specialty Chicken on the market today.'

Specialty Chicken, will be part of the pizza chain's $5.99 mix and match deal, which lets you order one of the four flavors as well as another item from the menu.

According to Bob Golden, executive 
vice president at restaurant research firm Technomic, this move by 
Domino's to create more innovative chicken dishes may well be a smart 
one.

'[Chicken] has a 
little bit more halo than red meats,' he told USA Today, explaining that
 consumers tend to see it as a 'healthier' option (though the calorie count for Specialty Chicken has yet to be released).

But, he added, it's also a risky move. 'Every time a pizza chain tries to diversity, it usually doesn't work so well,' he said.

Judging by the ad for Specialty Chicken, Domino's is fully aware that it is something of a gamble.

Get ready: Specialty Chicken will be part of the chain's $5.99 mix and match deal and will launch officially on April 21

'You know, at Domino's, failure is an option,' says a man in the commercial.

And Domino's 'chicken chef' Tate Dillow explains: 'If we gave up after every mistake, we wouldn't come up with something really special like our new Specialty Chicken.'

In related fast food news, it was revealed today that KFC will be relaunching its Double Down meal, a bacon and cheese sandwich with fried chicken filets instead of bread.

According to USA Today, the sandwich will be available starting April 21 - coincidentally, the same day as Domino's Specialty Chicken - for a limited time only.
