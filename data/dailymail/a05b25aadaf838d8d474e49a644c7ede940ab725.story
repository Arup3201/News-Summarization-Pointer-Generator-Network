A fraudster who forged the signatures of notable British figures scammed more than £33,000 out of collectors and enthusiasts by claiming they were real.

Allan Formhals, 68, lived a 'criminal lifestyle' by selling books that he said were signed by top historical and literary names such as Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Winston Churchill, Southampton Crown Court heard.

Other signatures he faked included those of the former Lord Protector of England, Oliver Cromwell, author Joseph Conrad and The Hobbit Lord of the Rings author J.R.R. Tolkien.

Original: Pablo's Picasso's signature, one of a number that Formhals forged in order to con collectors and enthusiasts out of more than £33,000 - which the court has given him six months to pay back

In 2012 Formhals, from Milford-on-Sea, Hampshire, was sentenced to 10 months in prison after a jury at Southampton Crown Court found him guilty of 10 counts of fraud.

At a confiscation hearing yesterday, Judge Peter Henry ordered the 68-year-old to pay the money he earned during the scam.

The court heard he lived off his criminal activity for nearly nine months before being caught with money going to accounts in his name.

Judge Peter Henry told Formhals that his 'property is going to have to be sold' to fund him paying back the £33,384.49 set out by prosecutors.

Judge Henry said: 'I find that Formhals had a criminal lifestyle and that he had benefitted from that criminal lifestyle of the total sum set out by the prosecution in their statement, namely £33,384.49.'

Another victim, Corinna Honan, bought signed books from Formhals with 'autographs' by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.

Fraud: The signature of author Joseph Conrad (bottom) is among those that Formhals forged (top) during his scam, which allowed him to live a 'criminal lifestyle' for nearly nine months, Southampton Crown Court heard

In 2012, Formhals denied 15 charges of 
fraud from 2009 to 2011 and was found guilty of 10 counts, acquitted of 
two and jurors could not decide on a further three charges.

Two of the charges he was convicted of included being in possession of articles for the use in fraud included forged autographs.

More than £6,430 of the total will be divided among the victims of his crimes. Formhals has six months to pay or will face a 15-month jail sentence.
