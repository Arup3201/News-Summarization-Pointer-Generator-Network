Tragedy: Ana Hernandez, 32, fell in love with Darren Stott, 42, in Gran Canaria, and moved to South Yorkshire with him.

A pregnant lawyer who died from an apparent overdose had told friends she feared her fiancé was trying to kill her, an inquest heard.

Ana Hernandez, 32, was found dead on her bed at the home she shared with Darren Stott.

A post-mortem examination revealed a cocktail of drugs – none of which had been prescribed to her – in her system.

Tests also revealed the drugs may have been mixed into a spicy stew which she had eaten.

Police initially concluded there was nothing suspicious about the death as she had been given paracetamol for a headache despite her strong opposition to the idea.

But now a coroner has dramatically adjourned the hearing into her death so that police can look into ‘very important’ claims that she believed she was being poisoned by her university lecturer fiancé, who was described as a ‘control freak’.

The coroner’s office was recently unable to contact Mr Stott, 42, who moved to the Canary Islands – where the couple originally met – after her death in June and he did not attend the inquest on Thursday.

Friends and relatives of the Spaniard, who was four months pregnant, were stunned by her sudden death as she was a fitness fanatic and vehemently opposed to taking medication during pregnancy.

Her family insisted the staunch Roman Catholic would never have taken her life. 

The inquest heard Mr Stott, who lectured at Leeds Metropolitan University, met Miss Hernandez in April 2011.

She proposed to him on February 29 and moved in March to live with him in the village of Barnburgh, near Doncaster.

A statement from Mr Stott said said when she found out she was pregnant ‘I was extremely happy and so was Ana’.

In early June the couple visited the home of local friends, Geoff and Carolyn Telford, for a drink.

Mr Telford said: ‘She told me, “Darren is trying to kill me. He’s trying to make me take drugs.” She wasn’t very happy.’

Mrs Telford said Miss Hernandez complained of a headache and said: ‘He’s trying to kill me with these drugs.’

The inquest was told Mr Stott travelled to Berkshire to attend a course on June 26.

His fiancee’s body was found two days later at their three-bedroom bungalow after Mr Stott asked the Telfords to check on her.

Pathologist Dr Kim Suvarna said ‘very high’ levels of paracetamol, tramadol, codeine and cyclizine  were found in her stomach.

Each of the drugs on their own would have been enough to kill her. She had died after eating a highly-spiced stew and the pathologist said there was evidence to suggest the tablets could have been ground down.

The coroner has ordered further 
toxicology tests to shed more light on how she died.

The inquest heard 
tablets were found in every room in the house, all prescribed to Mr 
Stott for a variety of ailments.

Asked about Mr Stott, Detective Sergeant
David Roberts told the inquest: ‘There was just something about him 
that made me feel uncomfortable.’

Miss Hernandez’s brother Rafael, 42, 
who lives in the Doncaster area, said Mr Stott was a ‘control freak’ who
wanted to know her every movement.

Coroner Nicola Mundy adjourned the 
inquest in Doncaster and said: ‘I am far from satisfied with what I have
heard. Very important matters have come out which need to be pursued.’

She said there were ‘glaring inconsistencies’ in Mr Stott’s account.

New life: Ms Hernandez moved to the village of Barnburgh (pictured), South Yorkshire, to live with Mr Stott who she met in Gran Canaria. She was studying English at Doncaster College and hoped to resume her legal career in the UK or back in Gran Canaria
