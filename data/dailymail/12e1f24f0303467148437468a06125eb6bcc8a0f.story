Tragic: Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in her own home in Valley Springs, California, last month

Police have arrested the 12-year-old brother of an 8-year-old girl who was mysteriously stabbed at her home in a rural Northern California community last month.

The boy, who has not been identified, will be charged with homicide, Calaveras County Sheriff Gary Kuntz told reporters on Saturday.

The April 27 attack on Leila Fowler shook the tightknit Valley Springs community of about 7,400 people and set off a massive manhunt.

The boy had told police he found his sister's body and encountered an intruder in the home while their parents were at a Little League game.

He described the man as being tall with long gray hair.

Police have said there was no sign of a burglary or robbery at the house.

Investigators did a door-to-door sweep of homes, storage sheds and horse stables scattered across the oak-studded hills foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Divers also searched two nearby reservoirs in search of clues.

As part of the investigation, authorities seized several knives from the home Leila shared with her father, stepmother and siblings to determine if one could have inflicted the fatal wounds.

A neighbor who told detectives she saw a man flee the Fowler home later recanted the story and was discredited by police.

Horrifying: Leila Fowler's 12-year-old brother was at their home with her in Valley Springs around noon on Saturday when he claimed he had encountered the intruder, who immediately fled

Leila's brother was taken into custody at 5:10 p.m. Saturday and police hastily called a news conference to announce the arrest.

‘Citizens of Calaveras County, you can sleep a little better tonight,’ Kuntz said.

Authorities spent over 2,000 hours on
the investigation ‘to provide Leila Fowler's family answers to her 
death,’ the sheriff said.

Kuntz said the investigation was ongoing. He declined to provide further details.

Several days after the killing, 
hundreds of people gathered at Jenny Lind Elementary School where Leila 
was a popular 3rd grader. Her mother, Krystal Walters, tearfully thanked
the crowd for the support.

‘I just want to thank the entire 
community and all of our family and friends for all the overwhelming 
amount of support you've given our family,’ Walters said at the time. 
‘It will never be forgotten. Thank you.’

Calaveras County Deputy Coroner Steve
Moore said the girl died from multiple stab wounds. They have not 
revealed how many times she was stabbed or where.

Violent crime is so rare in the 
community of 7,400 people that even law enforcement officers have to 
stop and think when asked about the last time there was a stranger 
killing in the area.

'Probably five years ago was the last one I can remember,' said Officer 
Rebecca Myers of the California Highway Patrol, who was assigned to 
block access to the neighborhood of one-acre ranchettes.
