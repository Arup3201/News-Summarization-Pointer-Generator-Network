Most women who socialise in pubs or clubs will have experienced some kind of unwanted attention on a night out whether it's heavy breathing down their neck at the bar, a grope on the dance floor,  crass comments, bum pinching or aggressive 'banter'.

Sadly, being hassled on a night out is now seen as the norm and as such often goes unchallenged and unreported.

But one London council is taking a stand against harassment by working with local pubs, clubs, bars and restaurants to introduce a Women's Safety Charter.

Southwark council have introduced a Women's Safety Charter in a bid to help women feel secure on a night out and  stamp out harassment in the area

Southwark council is asking local businesses to sign up to a set of commitments designed to give women the confidence to report incidents to venue managers.

The borough in south east London is home to almost 500 licensed venues and wants to send a clear message to customers that any level of harassment will not be tolerated. 

Thirty venues, including the famous Ministry of Sound nightclub and Elephant and Castle’s The Coronet, had already signed up when the charter was launched on Tuesday.

They say: 'Southwark Council takes this type of harassment seriously and believes it is an issue that reduces women’s quality of life.

'So, we carried out a large scale consultation with the public, council and partner officers, elected members and licensees to hear about their experiences and understand what can be done keep women safe from harassment on a night out. 

'We are proud to be launching the Women's Safety Charter, developed with venues in the borough. 

'The charter is based on a number of key principles which ensure that all staff working at licensed premises act in a responsible and supportive manner, taking all reports seriously. The intention is that the WSC will send out a clear message that female harassment in these premises will not be tolerated.'

Councillor Radha Burgess, the country's first deputy cabinet member for women's safety said: 'Typically, harassment is seen as "normal" and goes without being reported or even spoken about.'

Championing the campaign is Councillor Radha Burgess, the country's first deputy cabinet member for women's safety. 

She said: 'Typically, harassment is seen as "normal" and goes without being reported or even spoken about. As a council we believe it is time this trend was reversed and that women are made to feel confident enough to speak out against incidents that make them feel uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened. 

'Everyone deserves to enjoy a night out without the fear of harassment or intimidation. We want to show harassment to women and girls isn’t acceptable.'

The charter was created after speaking to female Southwark residents, and Radha told The Telegraph: 'There’s a kind of ubiquity of harassment and groping that happens in clubs. We need to help women get home safely. Women in nightclubs still feel men are quite predatory. 

'I think harassment of women is all about the idea that women are occupying men’s spaces. They’re either not welcome or need to be controlled in some way. That kind of feeling underpins how women feel in public spaces and nightclubs.'

The five point charter aims to encourage women to speak out about incidents that make them feel uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened  

Venues who have signed up to the scheme promise to...

1. Prominently display high visibility posters in the venue which discourage harassment and encourage reporting

2. Take every report of harassment and sexual intimidation seriously and take appropriate action

3. Take active steps to support persons who report harassment or sexual intimidation which might take place in their premises

4. Train all front of house staff to address women’s safety and harassment

5. Take active steps to ensure women leave the venue safely
