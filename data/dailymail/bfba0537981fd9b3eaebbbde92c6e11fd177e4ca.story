Whether its the romance of Rapunzel or the magic of Jack and the Beanstalk, classic children's tales have long held appeal for both parents and their offspring alike.

Now publisher Ladybird has now announced plans to make all of its books gender-neutral in a bid to ensure that children aren't swayed by their sex when choosing reading material.

Gendered titles include Favourite Fairy Tales for Girls, Sleeping Beauty and Favourite Stories for Boys, which along with Jack, includes classic yarn, Three Little Pigs.

Gender-neutral: Publisher Ladybird will no longer include 'girls' or 'boys' branding on its books

The publishing house, which is famous for its much-loved Peter and Jane primary reading books, said the re-brand, which will only affect six titles, came about after a petition was delivered by campaigners.

Speaking to activists from Let Books Be Books, a spokesman for the company said: 'At Ladybird, we certainly don’t want to be seen to be limiting children in any way.

'Out of literally hundreds of titles currently in print, we actually only have the six [gendered] titles you cite … so we offer a vast range for children and their parents.'

Let Books Be Books is an off-shoot of the larger Let Toys Be Toys campaign, which lobbies to have gendered branding removed from playthings.

Targets include anything branded with 'boys' or 'girls' such as M&S's 'Little Miss' and 'Boys' Stuff' ranges or Hobbycraft's 'Craft Kit for Girls' offering.

Several publishing houses have already responded to the campaign, among them Ladybird's parent company Penguin Random House which has promised to follow suit.

The parent-led group, which grew out of a thread on Mumsnet, has already enjoyed a series of successes, and has persuaded toy retailers M&S, Morrison's and Tesco, among others, to rethink their branding.

'We’re asking children’s publishers to take the ‘Boys’ and ‘Girls’ labels off books and allow children to choose freely what kinds of stories and activity books interest them,' say campaigners on their website.

Change: Ladybird agreed to change its ways following an approach from the Let Books Be Books campaign

'These books send out very limiting messages to children about what kinds of things are appropriate for girls or for boys. 

'Blue covers, with themes of action and adventure, robots, space, trucks and pirates contrast with a riot of pink sparkles, fairies, princesses, flowers and butterflies. 

'But real children’s interests are a lot more diverse, and more interesting, than that.'
