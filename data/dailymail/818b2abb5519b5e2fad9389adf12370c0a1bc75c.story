Every 13 year old boy dreams of scoring that one goal that will go down in the history books.  

Ipswich Town's Under 14 team achieved something very close to that when they crafted a beautiful goal that looked like it had come straight from Barcelona's famed La Masia academy.

With some wonderfully choreographed movement, the young Tractor Boys swagged their way up field with some controlled one-touch passing and finished it all off with a goal.

Some neat tiki-taka style football gets the young Tractor Boys out of a tight spot and they're on their way

It's all about the triangles as they head at full steam towards the halfway line with some neat passing

The strike came in a recent clash against Millwall U14s and was started off when the goalkeeper received the ball from one of his defenders.

Just like the tiki-taka style of play employed by Pep Guardiola's famous Barcelona side - who won three La Liga titles and two Champions League trophies in three years - the youngsters showed great control as they worked their way towards goal.

From start to finish, the ball was in the opposition net after just 30 seconds following a fine thirteen-pass combination.

The memorable masterpiece was rounded off with an inch-perfect through ball and an equally precise finish and will surely have caught the attention of first team boss Mick McCarthy.
