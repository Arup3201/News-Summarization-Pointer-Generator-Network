The U.S. State Department is evacuating diplomatic personnel out of Lebanon and Turkey as the Obama administration and Congress debate military strikes on neighboring Syria.

U.S. citizens are also being warned against traveling in 
Lebanon and southeastern Turkey, and Americans in the rest of 
Turkey are being urged to 'to be alert to the potential for violence.'

In Beirut, police used barbed wire to close off roads leading to the U.S. consulate building as Lebanese supporters of the Syrian regime staged a demonstration against the proposed U.S. strikes.

In Turkey, U.S. officials offered voluntary evacuation to reduce its diplomatic presence at the consulate in Adana, Turkey, 'because of threats against U.S. government facilities and personnel'

Officials did not offer specifics about 
the threats, which were revealed less than a week before the 12th 
anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and amid an intensifying U.S. debate
 over plans to strike Syria.

'Given the current tensions the 
region, as well as potential threats to U.S. government facilities and 
personnel, we are taking these steps out of an abundance of caution to 
protect our employees and their families, and local employees and 
visitors to our facilities,' said State Department spokeswoman Marie 
Harf.

The statements did not
 mention Syria, where Washington says troops loyal to Syrian President 
Bashar al-Assad carried out a poison gas attack that killed more than 
1,400 people in rebel-held suburbs of Damascus on Aug. 21.

In
 Lebanon, officials ordered non-emergency personnel and their family 
members out of the country 'due to threats,' the U.S. Embassy in Beirut 
said in statement.

The State Department urged 'U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to Lebanon because of current safety and security concerns.'

In
 Turkey, U.S. officials offered voluntary evacuation to reduce its 
diplomatic presence at the consulate in Adana, Turkey, 'because of 
threats against U.S. government facilities and personnel.'

'The
 Consulate General in Adana has been authorized to draw down its 
non-emergency staff and family members,' the State Department said in a 
statement.

It also recommended 'that U.S. citizens defer non-essential travel to southeastern Turkey.'

Strained relations: Vladimir Putin reaches out to shake hands with President Obama. A spokesman for the Russian presidency said a US strike on Syria would 'drive another nail into the coffin of international law'

Mounting pressure: Syrian refugees wait to be transferred to a camp at the border in Yayladagi Hatay, Turkey

The U.S. government will pay to fly out those who wish to leave Adana, a U.S. official said.

Americans
 who remain in Lebanon or southeastern Turkey should remain vigilant and
 make their own emergency plans, officials said.

Early
 last month, nearly 20 U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East 
and Africa were closed when the United States said it had picked up 
unspecified terrorism threats. The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, was 
closed for more than two weeks.
