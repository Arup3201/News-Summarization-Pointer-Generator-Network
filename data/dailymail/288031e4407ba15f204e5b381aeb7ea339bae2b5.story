Ski companies let out a collective sigh of relief as up to 30cm of snow finally fell across France, Switzerland and Austria today after what had been a worryingly mild start to the season.

In France, Val Thorens, Tignes and Courchevel all received fresh dumps of snow with Val D’Isere reporting a fall of 20cm.

And it is hoped that the snow will continue to fall with a number of French resorts expecting to receive anything between 10cm to 40cm of snowfall later this week.

At last! A thick blanket of snow covers the slopes of French ski resort Val D'Isere today which reported a fall of as much as 20cm

In Switzerland, it was snowing in both Andermatt and Arosa, which allowed riders on their slopes for the first time last weekend. Davos had 5cm of fresh snow and Zermatt received 10cm of fresh snow.

Samnaun also had a good day on Monday, and received one of the highest amounts of fresh snow in Switzerland with around 30cm.

In Austria, Obergurgl reported a fall of 10cm of fresh snow today and has 15 out of 24 ski lifts open.

Lech fared less well with 5cm of snow and only four out of its 84 lifts open and St Anton had just 3cm of snow with only two out of its 84 lifts open.

Resorts in Germany, Bulgaria and Scotland are yet to open for the season.

Vicky Norman of the Ski Club of Great Britain told MailOnline: ‘There’s great news in numerous European resorts who finally, after weeks of dry, warm conditions, have received anything between a light dusting and 30cm of the white stuff.

‘Resort villages have been transformed 
from green to white overnight and the forecast implies more snow is on 
the way.

'This has been a great confidence booster and could be the first
signs of what could turn out to be a fantastic winter season.’

Europe has been experiencing its warmest and driest autumn since 1864, meaning many European ski resorts had been forced to delay openings due to a shortage of snow, which was threatening to ruin 
pre-Christmas skiing holidays for thousands of Britons.

Resorts in France and Switzerland had been particularly badly hit.

Nine out of 12 French ski resorts had to delay their openings, including the Grands-Montets at Chamonix, Meribel and Megeve.

In the French Pyrenees, only two out of 36 resorts - Puigmal and Vallnord – had opened by the end of last week.

Val d’Isère and Tignes in France, along with Zermatt in Switzerland and Ischgl in Austria, had managed to open on schedule with around 20 per cent of their pistes, but others had to postpone their opening days.

World Cup races scheduled for Val d’Isère that normally mark the beginning of the European ski season had to be moved to Beaver Creek in Colorado.

This time last year, pistes across France - where most UK Alpine sports enthusiasts go - were almost all open.

Of the 36 resorts on the other side of France - in the Pyrenees - only two, Puigmal and Vallnord, is open. 

It
is the same in Switzerland, where canons are working overtime to 
produce fake snow at Klosters, where only a handful of runs on two out 
of five mountains have opened.

Last
week the French resort of Val d'Isere was forced to abandon the event, 
due to take place on December 10 and 11, because of the balmy autumn 
which has this year beleaguered the continent.

Markus
Unterfinger, a spokesman for the resort, which is popular with both 
Prince Charles and Chancellor George Osborne, said: 'It was the driest 
November here for 150 years, since records began.'

World Cup alpine races at Courchevel Alps ski resort are scheduled for later this month but may still be cancelled due to lack of snow

Although
snowfalls and lower temperatures are expected later this week, a 
spokesman for weather institute Meteo France said an 'exceptionally warm
and extremely dry' November included temperatures 2.5C above normal.  

This
has meant that December - traditionally a busy period on the slopes 
when many families try and use the holidays to ski and snowboard - could
be a wipe out.  

Snow joke: Just nine out of 12 resorts in France have currently yet to even start their season.

With government austerity measures 
biting in the UK, the French fear a lack of spare cash will combine with
the poor weather to stop people travelling for last-minute breaks too.

In
the meantime, those who have already booked will be checking travel 
insurance policies to see if they are entitled to compensation because 
of the lack of snow.

Most policies pay out nominal fee if 
there is no snow, but only if every ski lift is shut down. Resorts are 
known to keep one lift open at all times, no matter how poor the snow 
cover, to stop this happening.  

Some 400,000 British people travel to France to ski every season, with 250,000 heading for Austria, and 150,000 to Italy.  

Only around 75,000 go to Switzerland, but these tend to be richer holidaymakers, making the market an extremely lucrative one.  

If
conditions stay as they are, then many of them are expected to switch 
to skiing holidays in the USA, where conditions are currently far better
than in Europe.  

Despite 
the gloom, a spokeswoman for the Ski Club of Great Britain, said: 'There
is a lack of snow cover lower down in the Alps but snow is forecast 
over the coming weeks and this should dramatically improve conditions.
