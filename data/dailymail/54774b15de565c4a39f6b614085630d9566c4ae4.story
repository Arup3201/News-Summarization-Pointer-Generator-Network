Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt has been ticked off after his new history book was found to be riddled with errors - by his Tory rival Michael Gove.

Mr Hunt, a professional historian, has boasted of his 'deep and sustained reading' of history compared to the Education Secretary's ‘superficial understanding of the past’.

But the Labour MP, whose latest work - Ten Cities that Made an Empire - is set to be published next week, made at least 14 basic errors on dates, names and events according to a review of the book written by Mr Gove.

Historian and Labour shadow education spokesman Tristram Hunt has written a new book on the British Empire. But his Tory rival Michael Gove claims it is riddled with errors

The embarrassing errors include calling the Viscount Powerscourt the “Viscount Powerhouse”, and getting the date of the repeal of the Corn Laws wrong

Despite the string of errors in the book - for which Mr Hunt was paid £8,200 for writing according to the Register of Members’ Interests - Mr Gove praises it in a review to be published in The Times tomorrow.

He says the book stands comparison with 'works by some of our finest historians' and praises his rival’s writing.

'The author, who is my opposite number in the House of Commons, has produced a work of the very high standard I would have expected.'

But Mr Gove adds: 'It is not the case that the Nine Years’ War and the War of the Spanish Succession began in the late 1730s. They began in 1688 and 1701 respectively.

'And the Corn Laws were repealed in 1846 not 1844. It is to be hoped that these, and any other errors, can be corrected for what will no doubt be a highly successful paperback version of this otherwise exemplary read.'

Education Secretary Michael Gove praised his opposite number's new work - but picked out 14 errors that could be corrected for the paperback version

Several other mistakes have been spotted by Mr Gove. The book makes a reference to England as 'perfidious Albion' in 1744 - when the phrase did not become current for another 50 years.

Mr Hunt also writes of a British general election in 1888, yet there was no election that year. He claims that Lord Rosebery, a Liberal, expressed scepticism about whether the people of London would elect a black man, but this remark should have been attributed to the Conservative Lord Salisbury.

The Labour shadow education secretary  joked: 'Once again Michael Gove's sub-editing skills can be put to good use.'

According to the publishers, Penguin, Mr Hunt's book details 'the final embers of the British Empire' through the legacy it has left behind 'in the lives and structures of the cities which it shaped'.

'Here Tristram Hunt examines the stories and defining ideas of ten of the most important: Boston; Bridgetown; Dublin; Cape Town; Calcutta; Hong Kong; Bombay; Melbourne; New Delhi; and twentieth-century Liverpool.'

Mr Hunt apparently rejects 'standard binary views of the British Empire as "very good" or "very bad".'

Instead he 'describes the complex processes of exchange and adaptation that collectively shaped the colonial experience - and transformed the culture, economy and identity of the British Isles'.

But a Tory source warned potential readers not to judge the book by its cover.

He said: 'Just like Labour’s education policy, Tristram is all style and no substance. He can boast all he likes about his "deep and sustained reading" of history, but none of that matters if he can’t get his facts right.

'Let’s hope his publishers don’t rub salt into his wounds by asking for a refund. It will come as no surprise, except perhaps to Tristram himself, that polling shows he’s the only Labour politician less appealing than Ed Miliband.'

ONE 

Claim: 'A rolling succession of conflicts, beginning in the late 1730s, variously known as King William’s War (or the Nine Years’ War), Queen Anne’s War (War of the Spanish Succession)…'

Fact: It is not the case that the Nine Years’ War and the War of the Spanish Succession began in the late 1730s. They began in 1688 and 1701 respectively.

TWO 

Claim: 'In March 1744, France had joined Spain in the War of the Austrian Succession against the nation they had come to call perfidious Albion.'

Fact: England was not known as Perfidious Albion in 1744 – the phrase became current after 1793.

THREE

Claim: 'In 1792, the Dublin-born politician and philosopher Edmund Burke, who would prove such a glittering critic of imperialism in the British Houses of Parliament…'

Fact: Edward Burke was well-known as a critic of imperialism well before 1792 – as he showed with his opening speech at the impeachment of Warren Hastings in 1788.

FOUR 

Claim: 'The eponymous Powerscourt House on South William Street (designed by Richard Cassels for the third Viscount Powerhouse)…'

Fact: Richard Cassels was the architect for the third Viscount Powerscourt, not the Viscount Powerhouse.

FIVE 

Claim: 'In 1844 the Corn Laws would be repealed as a defining symbol of the abandonment of the protectionist past and the triumph of Manchester liberalism,…'

Fact: The Corn Laws were repealed in 1846 not 1844.

SIX 

Claim: 'But before Hong Kong came Singapore – the first of those rays of light dispelling the mercantilist gloom from the British Empire. In 1819 the East India Company writer Stamford Raffles began negotiations with Sultan Hussein Shah to secure the island, which was located in a prime position on the trading route between India and China. Sat between the Malay peninsula and the Indonesian archipelago, Singapore was historically part of the Dutch sphere of influence. Raffles’s achievement was to snatch it from under their nose in 1824, declare it a British possession and then institute a new model of colonialism predicated on the virtuous effects of free trade.'

Fact: Sir Stamford Raffles did not just begin negotiations with Sultan Hussein Shah for Singapore in 1819, he concluded them in February of that year and the territory was secure in British hands from then, with its own constitution in 1823 – it was not snatched “from under the nose” of the Dutch in 1824.

SEVEN 

Claim: 'In 1827, James Matheson, who had ordered the works of Adam Smith and David Ricardo to be sent out to him in China, attempted to change the culture with a weekly paper, the Canton Register, in order to "disseminate the principles of free trade".'

Fact: The Canton Register was not a weekly paper, it was published every two weeks.

EIGHT 

Claim: 'Despatched to China as lord superintendent of trade in the aftermath of the abolition of the East India Company monopoly in 1833,…'

Fact: The East India Company’s trade monopoly (save for trade in tea and trade with China) was ended in 1813, not 1833.

NINE 

Claim: 'In Britain, the entrepreneur and inventor Richard Arkwright – who had pioneered cotton production at his Cromford mills along Derbyshire’s Derwent Valley – was the first to use steam-power for the purposes of cotton-spinning in Manchester in the late 1780s.'

Fact: Richard Arkwright did not use steam power for the first time for the purposes of cotton spinning in Manchester in the late 1780s but in Derbyshire in 1777.

TEN 

Claim: 'Dadabhai progressed from the Corporation to the Bombay legislative council, thence to the Indian National Congress, before fighting seats in the British General Elections of 1886 and 1888.'

Fact: There was no British General Election in 1888 so Naoroji Dadabhai could not have stood in it.

ELEVEN 

Claim: 'Spectacularly disproving the future Liberal prime minister Lord Rosebery’s prediction that the people of London would never elect a ‘black man’,…'

Fact: It was the Conservative Lord Salisbury not the Liberal Lord Rosebery who expressed scepticism about the electoral fortunes of a “black man”.

TWELVE 

Claim: '"I believe in this race, the greatest governing race the world has ever seen," exclaimed the Liberal MP and colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain,…'

Fact: On the subject of Lord Salisbury, Joseph Chamberlain was not a Liberal MP any more when he was serving as Colonial Secretary in the Marquess’s Unionist administration.

THIRTEEN 

Claim: 'The roots of Britain’s suburban efflorescence were variously cultural, economic and technological. Its origins could be traced back to the Protestant evangelical revival of the late eighteenth century…'

Fact: Britain’s post-Augustan Protestant Evangelical revival did not occur in the “late eighteenth century” – the two principal preachers of the 'Great Awakening' – George Whitefield and John Wesley – established themselves in the 1730s and 1740s.

FOURTEEN 

Claim: 'Benjamin Disraeli’s Imperial Act of 1876 signaled the new approach in anointing Queen Victoria as empress of India.'

Fact: Victoria was made Empress of India by the Royal Titles Act of 1876 not the 'Imperial Act'.
