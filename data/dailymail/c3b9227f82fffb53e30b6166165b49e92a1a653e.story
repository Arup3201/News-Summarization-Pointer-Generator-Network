Bubba Watson has been known to give it a fair old whack on the course but the two-time Masters champion could be about to enjoy his biggest hit yet after releasing a song for Christmas.

Watson is no stranger to the music world after putting out a couple of videos with Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan as the Golf Boys.

Now he's going solo with, wait for it....  Bubba Claus The Single.

Cool as you like, Bubba Watson wears shades with his Santa suit as he sits on a tractor in his video

Bubba had company as Taylor Fulbright played the elf and Gumby put in an appearance

Watson has given himself the name for the past few years and dished out presents via a Twitter competition. And the American Ryder Cup star has found a fresh way to spread the joy this festive season.

What's his name who won X Factor might not have too much to worry about in the race for Christmas No 1 but Bubba's rap is certainly a grower.

All the cool kids will be singing lines like 'I just touched down on a hovercraft/I bet you want to know what’s in my bag/Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys? It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Bubba Claus.'

Or how about: 'Kids in the room they can’t even go to sleep/because they know I’m coming through putting gifts on a tree.'

It's a solo effort as far as the lyrics go but Bubba, who plays basketball and drives a tractor and golf buggy in the video, has a couple of co-stars.

Gumby is a green humanoid character made of clay, an American Morph if you like, and like every good Santa, Watson had an elf.

Watch the video here and scroll down for Watson's earlier releases with the Golf Boys. 

It's hard work making a music video as Watson has a lie down

Watson wouldn't let on who was in the Gumby costume

Santa's sack was replace by Bubba's golf bag in the video for his Christmas song

Every rapper should have a cool set of wheels - and Watson's golf buggy certainly oozes class

Christmas is also a time for shooting a few hoops on the basketball court if Bubba's video is anything to go by

Co-stars Gumby and the elf helped Bubba make his Christmas video

Bubba lets rip with a swing from the roof of his buggy - don't try that at home kids

I just touched down on a hovercraft

I bet you want to know what’s in my bag

Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys?

It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Bubba Claus

I remember Christmas growing up in Bagdad

Chillin in the living room with my dad

Mama in the kitchen got food in the stove

Sister in the living room playing on the floor

I used to hit the golf course take me a swing

Got my first clubs this boy was a teen

Kids in their room can't even go to sleep

Cos they know I'm coming through putting gifts on a tree

No sled, no beard, no reindeer

I might come deliver gifts on a John Deere

KD asked me to bring him a new ball

But I'm checking ma list it's Bubba Claus

I just touched down on a hovercraft

I bet you want to know what’s in my bag

Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys?

It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Bubba Claus

I gotta big guy he's the reason I made it

I thank him every day for the moves that I make

Baby Jesus he was born in a manger

Cos he knew when I was born I was gonna be the saviour

Thank you for my clothes and the shoes on my feet

Thank you for my kids and the food that they eat

Thank you for my house and the house where we sleep

I wake up every day and put it on repeat

I just touched down on a hovercraft

I bet you want to know what’s in my bag

Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys?

It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Bubba Claus

 

If the music doesn't take off Watson, winning his second Green Jacket last April, always has the day job
