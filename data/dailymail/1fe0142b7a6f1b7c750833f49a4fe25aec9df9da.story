A benefits cheat pocketed almost £40,000 of Disability Living Allowance by claiming he could only walk with a stick - despite teaching martial arts across the country.

Mark Kemp, 58, claimed £35,000 worth of the benefit over 15 years - during which time he became an expert in Ju-Jitsu.

Kemp of Oldham, Greater Manchester, was even credited with helping to invent a discipline called Shin Ga Do.

Mark Kemp pocketed £35,000 in Disability Living Allowance over 15 years despite being a martial arts teacher. He told the Department of Work and Pensions he would only walk with a stick

DWP investigators infiltrated the teacher's lessons and found him throwing kicks and blocking punches

He led classes in the sport at the Tameside Kempo Ju-Jitsu Club in the city. A picture of the man even appeared on the club's website.

But the black belt cheat was exposed when investigators infiltrated his sessions and saw the father- of-two throwing kicks and blocking punches.

Kemp was even filmed playing golf and enjoying a family day out at Southport Pleasure Beach during the Department for Work and Pensions probe.

Kemp had originally started claiming DSA legitimately in 1992 after being injured in a car accident - but failed to tell the authorities when his health improved, a court heard

Kemp was handed a six-month sentence, suspended for one year at Manchester Crown Square

He had claimed to the DWP he could not walk without a stick.

Kemp has narrowly avoided jail after pleading guilty to two charges of falsely claiming benefits at Manchester Crown Square.

The court heard Kemp had originally started claiming DSA legitimately in 1992 after being injured in a car accident - but failed to tell the authorities when his health improved.

For four years while he was wrongly claiming benefits, Kemp also worked as a driver for a mobility company - taking people who were genuinely disabled to medical appointments and lifting them in and out of ambulances.

Nicola Daley, prosecuting, said: 'It was apparent to investigators that by 2012 Mr Kemp's health had significantly improved which had not been reported.

'Statements were taken from friends or associates and they described how he has been capable of taking martial arts classes for a number of years and had no difficulty being on his feet for over two hours.'

When interviewed by investigators in 2012, Kemp said his health hadn't improved - but later pleaded guilty to the two charges at court.

Defending, Paul Bryning said his client had no previous relevant convictions and was otherwise of good character.

Kemp was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year and a curfew to stay in his home between 9pm and 7am for four months.

Speaking after the case, Roy Paul, DWP north west fraud manager, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system.'
