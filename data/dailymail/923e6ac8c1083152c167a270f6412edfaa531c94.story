A California store that looked as if it was selling chairs and couches was actually in the business of peddling pot.

Police believe the Bay Area furniture store opened by Phuc Nguyen, 39, was really a front for his illegal indoor marijuana growing operation.

The front of the Gilroy Furniture & More store, which never even opened for business, was  filled with furniture that wasn't even for sale.

Police found more than 1,000 marijuana plants and more than 50 pounds of processed marijuana in the back room of the alleged furniture store

Phuc Nguyen, 39, was charged with theft of utilities and illegal cultivation of marijuana for sale

However, the store's back room contained more than 1,000 marijuana plants  and more than 50 pounds of processed marijuana. 

The street value of that amount of cannabis is about $2million.

Officers from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office obtained a search warrant and raided the store after a month-long investigation. 

After finding the marijuana, they also discovered that Nguyen had 'bypassed the electrical meter and had stolen an estimated $80,000 worth of electricity.'

Nguyen was arrested in the store and booked on charges of theft of utilities and illegal cultivation of marijuana for sale.

Santa Clara County Sheriff's Sgt. Kurtis Stenderup told NBC Bay Area: 'We don't see a lot of storefront operations with a large-scale illegal enterprise going on in the back. 

'I think in the movies and on TV they like to think it happens all the time, but in reality, we just don't see that level of sophistication.'

Last year, the Santa Clara Sheriff’s Office Marijuana Enforcement Team seized more than 104,000 pot plants and more than 250 pounds of processed marijuana.

The team also arrested 20 people and seized three firearms. Nguyen is being held on $200,000 bail.
