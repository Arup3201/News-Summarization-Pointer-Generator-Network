A theatre has been forced to apologise after sending more than 100 'disgusting' porn DVDs to children as young as 10 after a duplication blunder.

Families were expecting to receive recordings of summer school performances from the Edinburgh Playhouse, but a collection of hardcore movies called The Bondage Mistress were sent instead.

Theatre bosses said the 'horrifying' error was made by production company Edithouse – which has also apologised for the mistake.

Edinburgh Playhouse has been forced to apologise after sending out more than 100 'disgusting' porn DVDs to children as young as 10 after a duplication blunder

A 10-year-old girl from Midlothian, who had attended a summer stage school at the Playhouse earlier this year, was reported to have been sent the DVD.

Her father described the film as 'absolutely disgusting filth' and said he would be taking legal action.

'Someone has broken the law somewhere here, to send that sort of thing out to a child,' he told the Edinburgh Evening News.

'This is sexual exploitation-type stuff. I'm going to have to phone my solicitor. It's absolutely ridiculous.

'We haven't watched right through it, but it's not just amateur porn – this is the proper thing. It's unbelievable.

'It was absolutely disgusting filth. I spoke to the Playhouse and they said all they can do is apologise. Apologise? They have just sent this out to a minor.'

The theatre discovered the mistake within 48 hours of the DVDs being posted and has since recalled around 100 DVDs.

But furious parents, many of whom were waiting for the DVDs for months, posted messages on social media demanding further action.

A spokeswoman for Edinburgh Playhouse said: 'We discovered what had happened within 48 hours of the DVDs being posted and took immediate emergency measures to recall all of the DVDs, sought the advice of the police and notified customers as a matter of urgency.

'The Edinburgh Playhouse apologises unequivocally for any distress caused to the families affected by this totally unacceptable and unseemly mistake.'

Production-company Edithouse said it takes 'full responsibility' for the mistake, which was made while the DVDs were being duplicated.

He added: 'We would like to apologise sincerely to the Playhouse for the inconvenience and most importantly to the children and parents affected by this terrible error. We are sorry for any distress caused.'
