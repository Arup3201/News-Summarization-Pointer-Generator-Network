Angela Cobbina, 41, who was Dutch banking giant ABN Amro's top lawyer in Britain, has claimed she suffered a miscarriage due to the stress of being hounded out of her job and subjected to a string of racist remarks

A senior lawyer at a global banking firm has claimed she suffered a miscarriage due to the stress of being hounded out of her job and subjected to a string of racist remarks.

Angela Cobbina, 41, who was Dutch banking giant ABN Amro’s top lawyer in Britain, claims the firm’s UK chief executive Paul Schuilwerve made repeated racist comments at her expense and that led to her being 'systematically frozen out'.

And she fears the stress of her ordeal could have contributed to her suffering a miscarriage early last year.

Now Ms Cobbina is suing the bank for a reported £300,000 for sex, race and religious discrimination over claims she was a victim of a 'campaign' of harassment.

A hearing at Central London Employment Tribunals today heard how Mr Schuilwerve strongly denies allegations of racism.

However, the tribunal heard he threw his support behind the controversial Dutch tradition of ‘Black Pete’.

The tradition, part of the annual Christmas St Nicholas parade, involves white people ‘blacking up’ and parading through the streets, has been condemned as racist by the UN.

In documents presented to the tribunal, Ms Cobbina said Mr Schuilwerve began his racist abuse the first time he met her in September 2012.

During the meeting in London he looked at a colour picture of the lawyer and remarked: 'We cannot even see you in the picture.' The lawyer claimed the remark was clearly a reference to her skin colour.

'I felt upset, humiliated and belittled by Mr Schuilwerve’s comment about my photo,' she said in her witness statement.

'I did not make a complaint about Mr Schuilwerve’s comment at the time because he had been my line manager for less than 2 weeks and I did not wish to be seen as a trouble maker or deemed "sensitive".'

Ms Cobbina, of Streatham, south London, claims that over the next 12 months she was the 'target of a campaign designed to remove or drive me from the business.'

She added: 'I was variously excluded, overlooked, targeted for undue criticism (including in connection with my performance, conduct, appearance and personal belief) and otherwise treated differently from my colleagues.'

At a meeting the following June she claims Mr Schuilwerze again 'taunted' her about her race after one of their colleagues described himself as the ‘black sheep of the family’.

The tribunal heard that the Dutch executive had said: ‘Speaking of that, what about Blackfriars? Let’s talk about all things black. Is Blackfriars the same as Blackadder?’

Ms Cobbina accused her boss of singling her out, and said: 'Mr Schuilwerve’s exaggerated enunciation whenever he mentioned the word "black".

'I felt this emphasis was unusual. I was and am clear that his words were connected to my presence.

'This is endorsed by the fact there is no logic to this remark. It is simply a series of unconnected words the incorporate the word black.'

In the midst of the alleged racist campaign against her, Ms Cobbina discovered she was pregnant during the Christmas break 2012.

She said she was 'ecstatic' at the prospect of becoming a mother for the first time, but claims Mr Schuilwerve bullied and intimidated her at a meeting on January 30 last year.

She said: 'That night I experienced severe stomach pain and miscarried my baby.

'I will never know for certain whether these two events are related. But I connected them in my mind at the time and still do.'

Despite the misscarriage she 'did not dare take the day off sick', the tribunal was told in Ms Cobbina's written statement.

She said: 'I was devastated as was my partner. I could not believe that we had lost our child and even as I am putting together my witness statement I still feel numb.

'Instead of becoming a mother, I have been through an elongated grievance and appeal process at the same time as consulting with the bank about the ending of my employment for a period of almost seven months, before being dismissed from my job at a time when I should have given birth.'

When she complained about Mr Schuilwerve’s behaviour the firm 'made great show of conducting a confidential internal procedure' but he was 'kept abreast of developments' and was pushing for her dismissal.

She was told in February 2013 the bank was considering axing her position as part of restructuring, and in September 2013 informed she being made redundant.

Giving evidence today, Mr Schuilwerve was quizzed about his attitude to race after it emerged he ‘liked’ a petition to keep the ‘black Pete’ Christmas parades on his Facebook page.

The father-of-three defended the petition, which was signed by more than one million Dutch people. He said was to protect the St Nicholas parade, a popular childrens’ event and had nothing to do with race.

He told the hearing: 'There were certain individuals at the time who wanted to stop the tradition of the parade of St Nicholas and Black Pete conducted in the city of Amsterdam.

'This was a petition to support that tradition - it is a children’s festival.

'I have three children, and this is a very traditional event. There is nothing wrong with it.

'I’m also aware of the debate around the UN, I’ve said there is nothing wrong with this tradition. You have to see it in the context of Dutch tradition.

'And 91 per cent of the population support the tradition.'

Challenged over his support of the festival, Jack Feeny, representing Ms Cobbina, said: 'Some people consider that to be racist.'

Mr Schuilwerze said he was aware of this, but said 'racism doesn’t come into it'.

In his witness statement, he said he has a 'zero tolerance attitude to discrimination and harassment issues' and found the allegations 'deeply hurtful'.

Mr Feeny told the Dutch-born banker: 'You have prejudice against people of black descent.'

However, Mr Schuilwerze replied: 'I do not.'

The bank strongly denies all the allegations.

The tribunal continues.
