UFC title shots don't come around all too often. They are rarely earned without sacrifice and can serve as a fighter's career-defining accomplishment. But as difficult as it is to cement a shot at promotional gold, it's even tougher to take advantage of the opportunity. 

And for those challengers who taste defeat only to feel their time in the spotlight slip away, forging a divisional comeback is the only way to patch the wound. Here are three recently vanquished title threats who may be close to earning another shot at gold.

Joseph Benavidez

Team Alpha Male standout Joseph Benavidez resides in a division dictated by arguably the most dominant champion around in Demetrious Johnson. 

But considering Benavidez is the flyweight version of Urijah Faber, meaning he doesn't lose outside of a title fight, the two men should cross paths once more.

Expected to take on fellow Mighty Mouse leftover John Moraga at UFC 187, the 30-year-old has a chance to extend his current win streak to three. And in a weight class as shallow as a glass of water, Benavidez could once again find himself fighting for a title by the end of 2015 (if not early next year). 

He's a premier draw at 125 pounds, and one of only a few contenders who can actually instil some doubt about the champ's unheralded reign.

Benson Henderson 

Despite a recent jump up to welterweight and an impressive finish over rising contender Brandon Thatch, former lightweight champ Benson Henderson is still in the mix at 155 pounds. 

Add in the fact that Anthony Pettis just handed his title over to Rafael Dos Anjos at UFC 185, and Henderson should have an easier track back to contention considering Showtime had beaten him twice.

While RDA also defeated Smooth via knockout less than one year ago, it was a close contest before the Brazilian landed on unforeseen uppercut that shortly put Henderson on another planet. 

Needless to say, the 31-year-old is still in the pinnacle of his career and remains one of the most dangerous entities in the deepest division in MMA. He'll be able to log two more Octagon appearances by the end of the year and will have enough momentum to earn a shot should he win both outings.

Ricardo Lamas

With an epic showdown between featherweight kingpin Jose Aldo and Irish sensation Conor McGregor looming in the distance, guys like Ricardo Lamas are being drastically overlooked.

While Aldo swiftly defended his title opposite The Bully at UFC 169, Lamas did enough in the championships rounds to suggest an upset could happen should he dominate early.

But in order to get back into the mix in a division ruled by two international dynamos, the 32-year-old Chicagoan must debunk the evolving arsenal of former title contender Chad "Money" Mendes when the two collide at UFC Fight Night 63. 

Mendes is another name that could easily make this list, but he is at least two impressive victories away from a trilogy fight with the champion. Of course, if McGregor captures the title from Aldo in July at UFC 189, then all slates will be wiped clean.
