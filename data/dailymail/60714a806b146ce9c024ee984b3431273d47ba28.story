Disgraced Lib Dem Chris Huhne was warned to expect a tough start to prison life.

But, according to his girlfriend Carina Trimingham who visited him in Wandsworth jail yesterday, the former Cabinet minister is ‘absolutely fine and in good spirits’.

That may have something to do with the fact that they were able to spend two and a half hours sitting hand-in-hand, laughing and joking, according to witnesses.

Saying hello: Carina Trimingham visited Chris Huhne at Wandsworth Prison

Driving away: Carina Trimingham managed to get a penalty notice outside Wandsworth Prison in south-west London today after parking her Toyota in a residents' parking bay while visiting Chris Huhne

On leaving the prison in South West 
London, Miss Trimingham said claims that the 58-year-old 
multi-millionaire was ridiculed and bullied on his first day inside were
‘utter nonsense’.

Miss Trimingham said: ‘He is getting on well both with inmates and officers.’

The former Energy Secretary and his 
ex-wife Vicky Pryce, 60, were each jailed for eight months on Monday for
perverting the course of justice after swapping speeding points 10 
years ago.

Ironically, Miss Trimingham’s visit was beset by a motoring offence.

After driving from the couple’s 
£1.25m flat in Clerkenwell, central London, she left their eco-friendly 
Toyota Prius in a residents’ parking bay ... and returned later to find a
penalty ticket on the windscreen.

Miss Trimingham said this was because
she was allowed an extra 90 minutes with Huhne as it was her first 
visit, something she did not know.

She said: ‘I arrived at 7am, got to 
see him at 8am, and didn’t leave until after 10.30am. You can’t park 
there between 10 and 11 so I got a ticket.’

Fellow inmates looked on bemused as Miss Trimingham and Huhne sat hand-in-hand when they were reunited yesterday.

One woman, who was visiting her son, 
said: ‘I was sitting right beside him. He was laughing and joking, he 
looked fine to me. He was with his girlfriend. I couldn’t hear what they
were saying, but they were holding hands and staring into each other’s 
eyes. They didn’t seem upset to me.’

Miss Trimingham denied claims her partner has been mocked and bullied in jail. ‘There’s not a grain of truth in it,’ she said.

Vicky Pryce is 'actively considering' launching an appeal against her conviction, her lawyer said today.

Robert Brown said the case 'may be subject to appeal' and he would review transcripts of evidence given in court.

But he questioned whether Ms Pryce should have been charged with perverting the course of justice at all.

'More careful consideration could have been given to whether or not she should have been tried or whether she should have been treated as a potential victim or a potential witness,' he told BBC Radio 4.

Ms Pryce was sentenced to eight months in prison for her role in taking three penalty points for ex-husband Chris Huhne.

Asked if she would launch an appeal, he added: 'That is something we will actively consider.'

The 46-year-old said she had asked 
the former Liberal Democrat MP about the rumours and he had told her: ‘I
can’t believe it, nothing could be further from the truth.’

Miss Trimingham said her partner had 
been moved to the regular wing of the prison on Tuesday and is passing 
the time by reading, mainly novels.

She said: ‘The first night you are 
all watched for your first night and then you get moved, if you’re OK, 
to the regular wing. That’s where he is going to stay. He has got no 
desire to move to another wing.

‘He has not been bullied or ridiculed by any prisoners or officers and no-one has asked him for any money.’

Meanwhile, Pryce has been moved to a 
dormitory at Holloway Prison which she must share with three other 
women, a former inmate claimed.

The 27-year-old, who was freed 
yesterday, said there had been an ‘excited buzz’ among prisoners when 
they learned Huhne’s ex-wife was on her way there.

She said: ‘If she keeps her head down she’ll be fine. As far as I know, no one’s threatened her or anything.’

Yesterday it emerged that the 
Attorney General is considering whether the sentences handed to Huhne 
and Pryce were ‘unduly lenient’. Tory MP David Burrowes wrote to Dominic
Grieve asking him to refer the sentences to the Court of Appeal.

He said defendants in similar cases 
had received jail terms of a year or more and Huhne and Pryce’s conduct 
had many aggravating features.

Meanwhile Pryce’s lawyer Robert Brown
said they are considering appealing against her conviction, but will 
not make a decision until they have studied court transcripts.
