Vladimir Putin cancelled his government's festive holiday yesterday, calling politicians back to the Kremlin to try to save the ailing economy. 

The Russian president told subordinates they could not afford a long break this year as the country's financial climate was in such a dire state.

Last week Barack Obama warned the country's currency was on the brink of collapse after a series of punitive trade sanctions were imposed as a result of the Ukraine conflict. 

Putin warned the government 'could not afford' to take a long festive break and that they must try to save the flailing economy

Putin is reported to have told ministers via state television that they 'could not afford such extensive holidays, at least not this year.'

'You know what I am talking about,' he said, before insisting he had been 'making efforts to change the structure of our economy.'

'Quite a lot has been done in this direction, however, recent events show that this is not enough,' CNN reports him as saying. 

Earlier this week the leader discouraged politicians from increasing the price of vodka despite the country's economic woes.

He warned colleagues that hiking the prices of strong spirits would provoke bootleg businesses to brew cheap liquor that would be dangerous to the country's health. 

Meanwhile Siberian senator told women not to indulge in buying expensive, foreign cosmetics to save money. 

Igor Chernishev suggested women who could not afford expensive imported lipstick could opt for the ‘natural look’ or even use beetroot as an alternative to make-up.

American President Barack Obama warned Vladimir Putin that Russia was at the centre of of 'huge economic contraction' following the conflict with Ukraine

Mr Chernishev, who represents the city of Tomsk, wrote on a Russian website: ‘Women can live without imported lipstick, men like a natural look.

‘And if they really must use make-up on the lips – there’s no problem, they can use beetroot. It’s natural and chemicals don’t enter the body.’

The Russian economy is the most damaged it has been since 1998 when the country devalued the rouble and defaulted on its debt.

Sanctions imposed by the West and the falling price of oil is likely to push the country into recession in 2015.
