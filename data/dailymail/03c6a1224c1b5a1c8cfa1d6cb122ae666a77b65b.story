Bayern Munich duo Manuel Neuer and Arjen Robben arrived in style at the FIFA Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich after flying in by private jet.

They travelled from the German champions' winter training camp in Doha, Qatar to Switzerland early on Monday in time for the gala event at the Kongresshaus.

Neuer, their 28-year-old goalkeeper, will go head-to-head with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the main prize, the Ballon d'Or.

Meanwhile, 30-year-old Dutch winger Robben is hoping to take his place in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for 2014.

Robben and Neuer were pictured outside the team hotel in Doha as they prepared to jump into a car to the airport, before a later tweet showed them aboard the private jet bound for Zurich.

It was accompanied by the message: 'Good flight and good luck, boys! #NeuerForBallonDor'

Bayern's Philipp Lahm, who captained Germany to World Cup glory, will also attend the Zurich ceremony

Defender Philipp Lahm, who captained Germany to World Cup success back in the summer, was also on board the flight.

The past 12 months brought more success for Bayern, who won a Bundesliga and German Cup double and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League.

And their team formed the backbone of the Germany side that lifted the World Cup in Brazil during the summer.
