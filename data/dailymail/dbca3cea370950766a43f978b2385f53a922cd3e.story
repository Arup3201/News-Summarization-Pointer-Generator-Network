A man has successfully sued the police after they made off with his car.

James Ferrari of Manhattan was charged with a DUI in 2009 when he was pulled over for speeding while driving near his weekend home in Bellport, and the arresting officers seized his vehicle, a 2003 Ferrari Modena.

Then, after a Suffolk County judge ruled the car belonged to the police, they auctioned the vehicle off.

James Ferrari (above with Kanye West) was awarded $95,000 after police seized his car and then auctioned it after pulling him over for a DUI during a 2009 stop

Ferrari, 61, had initially claimed the car, a 2003 Ferrari Modena (new model above), was worth $110,000

Ferrari sued however, and now, a few years later, he has been awarded $95,000 by a jury after claiming the car was worth $110,000. 

'I’m very happy that it’s done with,' Ferrari, 61, told the New York Post. 

'The government taking people’s property isn’t right.'

As for the coincidence between his vehicle and surname, he told the paper; 'There’s no relation . . . It was just a car.'
