Sunderland have made further enquiries about Cardiff's Jordon Mutch and hope to agree terms with Fiorentina for Marcos Alonso despite interest from West Ham.

Sunderland were reported to have agreed a £1.5million deal for the Bluebirds midfielder in June. The 22-year-old was Cardiff's top goalscorer last season and was not keen to drop back down to the Championship.

The club are looking to wrap up many deals early on, with Billy Jones and Jordi Gomez already signed.

The Black Cats had also mooted a swap deal for Alonso, who made 20 appearances at the Stadium of Light last season, with Modibo Diakite moving in the opposite direction.

However, Fiorentina are more interested in a swap plus £2million cash after French defender Diakite spent part of the campaign on loan there.

West Ham and Swansea have also shown interest in 23-year-old defender Alonso, especially if the Hammers  fail in their bid to land Nice left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak.
