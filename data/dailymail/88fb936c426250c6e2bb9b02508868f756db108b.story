Richie Benaud has put his dulcet tones to good use, inviting icons past and present to an Australia Day lamb barbecue at his house.

The voice of Australian cricket calls on the likes of Captain Cook, Ned Kelly and Don Bradman to join him for a knees up at his waterfront home as part of a campaign for Meat and Livestock Australia.

The 84-year-old has not returned to the microphone at the Nine Network's cricket commentary team this summer as he continues to battle skin cancer.

Journalist and businesswoman Ita Buttrose (left) was more than happy to accept the invite from the back of her limousine, and explorers Burke (pictured bottom, in right side image) and Wills (pictured top, in right side image) agreed to attend from what looks like the Aussie outback

But the national treasure has taken on a new role in the annual Australia Day lamb campaign - capturing the spirits by doing what we believe every Aussies should be doing - organising a big lamb BBQ and a game of backyard cricket.

Benaud has joined with 'Lambassador' Sam Kekovich as well as a host of national and historical icons to join him in bringing everyone together to share the most-loved chops and cutlets.

The advertisement opens on an open sea, with Captain Cook aboard his ship as he approaches the Australian shore line. 

His steely focus on the path ahead is interrupted by a phone call from Benaud inviting him to a 'barbie' at his place on Australia Day.

'Cooky' agrees, and asks if fellow explorers Burke and Wills are also on the guest list – they're keen, despite their death-bed-dire situation in a baking hot desert.

Benaud later looks worried when legendary outlaw Ned Kelly offers to 'round up the guys' for the occasion, although this is less worrying than the rumour that Kelly has gone 'veggo' (in fact he is just gluten intolerant). 

Other iconic Australians invited to Benaud's barbie include iconic cricketer Don Bradman, media giant Ita Buttrose, and of course Sam Kekovich.

Lamb-lovers can also score a once in a lifetime opportunity to spend their Australia Day with Richie Benaud himself. 

Ten Aussies (and two of their mates) are being given the opportunity to attend a BBQ to meet Benaud. 

To secure this exclusive invite people simply have to upload an impersonation of Benaud's lamb BBQ call 'Top Lamb Chop That!' to the We Love Our Lamb Facebook page.

But when Billy Birmingham – famous for impersonating Benaud as the 12th Man – gets wind of the lamb feast, he's bluntly told by Benaud that there's nothing on. 

Benaud said: 'In addition to my love of cricket on Australia Day, I wanted to be involved in another key part of our national day, the iconic lamb campaign.

'For me, this year's campaign encapsulates what Australia Day is all about; Australians getting together for a lamb BBQ.'

General Manager Global Marketing at Meat & Livestock Australia Michael Edmonds said: 'As a nation we love our lamb, and it's our belief that you never lamb alone. 

'That goes double on Australia Day. Benaud might not be at the cricket surrounded by his army of fans this year, but he's still making the most of the day and spending it with this pantheon of notable Australians.'
