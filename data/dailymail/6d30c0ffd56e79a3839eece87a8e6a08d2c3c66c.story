Secret justice – of the kind that kept Rolf Harris’s name out of the media for weeks after his arrest and could have undermined the case against him – has become the norm across England and Wales, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Not one of the 43 police forces will issue the name of an arrested person to the press, while only a small minority will even confirm a suspect’s name when it is put to them by journalists, our survey showed.

Anti-secrecy campaigners have repeatedly warned that many historical abuse cases may never come to court or be successfully prosecuted unless names are issued on arrest. Failing to name suspects also stops other victims from coming forward.

Rolf Harris's lawyers battled to stop The Mail On Sunday reporting that the paedophile had been questioned by police on sex charges

Yesterday it emerged that more women came forward yesterday to claim they were also indecently assaulted by Harris. One of the alleged victims, all from New Zealand, was aged nine at the time.

Many of the women say they had been encouraged to come forward after Maggie Barry, a New Zealand MP, revealed on Friday that she was touched by Harris when she was interviewing him in the 1980s.

She told him he was a ‘sleazy creep’ after his hand slid up her thigh.

Since the revelation, her office has received eight emails and four phone calls from those with similar stories.

The Mail on Sunday found that only six forces – or 14 per cent – will give confirmation or guidance to journalists when a suspect’s name is put to them. After Harris was arrested in March 2013, his lawyers, Harbottle & Lewis, initially threatened the press with ‘consequences’ if he was named, claiming the public interest would not be served by doing so.

Yet after he was named the following month, a dozen witnesses came forward with their own stories of abuse, which helped to convict  Harris, 84, on 12 counts of indecent assault last week at Southwark  Crown Court.

Peter Watt, NSPCC director of national services, said: ‘If a suspect’s name is not known, the case against them may collapse through lack of witnesses, potentially putting children at risk of harm.’

One of the Leveson Report’s most controversial recommendations on press reform was that the names of arrested suspects should ‘not be released to the press or public’.

In May 2013, the College of Policing and the Association of Chief Police Officers issued guidelines to forces that enshrined these proposals.

Jodie Ginsberg, of campaigning group Index on Censorship, said this newspaper’s findings raised serious concerns. ‘Such sweeping powers  are maybe appropriate in rare cases but should not be the norm. De facto anonymity in arrests is completely against the principle of open justice in the UK,’ she said.

We asked all 43 police forces in England and Wales and received 33 responses. Some said their policy on naming suspects had not changed since Leveson; others that it had been reviewed. For most, a suspect will only be named in ‘exceptional circumstances’. 

Six forces – Derbyshire, Humberside, Kent, Merseyside, South Yorkshire and Wiltshire – said they would sometimes confirm a suspect’s name or reveal if a name was wrong.
