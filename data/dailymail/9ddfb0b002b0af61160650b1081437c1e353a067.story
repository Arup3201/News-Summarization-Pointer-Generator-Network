A  woman could face the death penalty after she was charged with murder for allegedly luring a young mother from Georgia to her death in a plot to kidnap her two children and claim them as her own.

Catherine Goins, 37, is accused of shooting dead Natalia Roberts, 30, last year, and if convicted, would be only the second woman on Georgia's death row.

Goins, of Hixson, Tennessee, had pretended she was pregnant and called police claiming she had shot an intruder inside her ex-boyfriend's home.

Lured to her death: Officials say Goins brought Roberts to her ex-boyfriend's house in La Fayette, Georgia, under the pretense of wanting to give her some baby clothes 

Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit District Attorney Herbert 'Buzz' Franklin filed a motion Thursday to seek the death penalty against Goins. 

But an investigation has revealed that Goins' home invasion story was nothing but a lie concocted to cover up a disturbing abduction plan, Catoosa County Sherif Gary Sisk told reporters, according to the station WRCB.

Investigators say Goins met Natalia Roberts, a mother of two, last September and lured her to the La Fayette home of her former paramour, Tony Richards, claiming she had some baby clothes for her.

When Roberts showed up at 227 Smoketree Circle sometime between 11am and 1pm, Goins allegedly shot her in the back of the head from a .380 caliber handgun as they were walking down a flight of stairs.

Before fleeing the crime scene with the victim's two young children in tow, Goins allegedly tried to cover up her tracks and called her ex-boyfriend, Tony Richards, telling him she had shot someone inside his residence.

Now, prosecutors are keen to seen the maximum penalty for her crime. However, the move is fairly rare, as prosecutors rarely pursue the death penalty against women.  

According to the Department of Corrections, out of the 85 inmates on death row in Georgia at the beginning of last year, only one inmate was a woman.  

Goins' attorney, Public Defender David Dunn, said the judicial circuit's four judges are deciding which one of them will preside over the case, according to The Times Free Press.

In cold blood: Sheriff's officials say Goins shot the woman (pictured) in the back of the head and then took off in her car with the victim's two children 

After a decision is made, that judge will hold  pretrial hearings to decide whether prosecutors can seek the death penalty. 

'We're calling it murder because that's what it is,' Sheriff Sisks told reporters. 'She flat-out murdered her.'

In murder trials, lawyers typically choose between two routes of defense: Either the police mistook the defendant for the real killer, or the defendant killed the victim in self-defense. 

Dunn has not discussed which he will pursue. 

Gruesome sight: When the owner of the house returned home, he found Roberts' lifeless body 

The sheriff added that Goins' most recent boyfriend broke up with her after discovering that she had been lying to him about being pregnant, so she decided to present Roberts' three-week-old baby as her own.

When Tony Richards returned home, he discovered a woman's lifeless body on his property and called 911. 

He then contacted Goins, who was fleeing with Roberts' two children, and convinced to return.

By the time police officers responded to the crime scene, the 37-year-old suspect made her way back to the La Fayette home.

When interviewed by police, Goins reportedly said she was at Richards' house when she heard a noise. 

She ran to the bedroom, grabbed a gun and shot at a 'darkened shadow' in the hallway, according to Northwest Georgia News.

Catherine Goins was arrested on September 23  on charges of malice murder; felony murder; tampering with evidence, and possessions of a firearm during the commission of a crime.

Natalia Roberts' two children, a 3-year-old and a 3-week old, are currently staying with family members.
