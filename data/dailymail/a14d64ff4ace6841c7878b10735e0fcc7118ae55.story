Presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich has promised to return to the glory days of the U.S. space programme and establish a permanent base on the moon by 2020... if he's elected president.

The former House speaker told a Florida audience he wanted to develop a commercial space industry similar to the airline boom of the 1930s.

And channeling the spirit of JFK - who threw his support behind the space programme to ensure the U.S. was first to land a man on the moon in 1969 - he insisted Russia and now China must 'not come close' to beating American space exploration.

Gingrich, the former House speaker, said that he wanted to develop a robust commercial space industry in line with the airline boom of the 1930s, leading to a permanent base on the moon

Nasa already has highly detailed plans for a proposed lunar outpost - following a plan put foward under George W. Bush.

Rocket landers will shuttle astronauts back and forth as they build a permanent base.

Minibus-sized vehicles will allow astronauts to navigate, while spider-like robots will help lift gear.

The astronauts will live in pressurised rooms.

'Week long visits to the lunar surface will be followed by increasingly longer stays as the outpost takes shape,' says the agency.

'The Altair lunar lander will be capable of landing four astronauts on the moon, and returning the crew to the Orion spacecraft that will bring them home to Earth.'

In front of a crowd of around 2,000 people at a hotel in Cocoa, Florida, he said: 'This will be the second great launch of the adventure John F. Kennedy started.

'I grew up with a romantic belief that space is our destiny.'

Gingrich said he wanted a competitive space programme based on 'prize money' incentives, with multiple launches possible at a time 'like an airport'.

A long-time space enthusiast, the 69-year-old also said he wanted to expand exploration of Mars, saying NASA could pay for ambitious plans by teaming up with the private sector.

The plans are a vote-winner in Florida, a region well known for the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Base but one that is still suffering from a round of federal cuts to the space programme last year.

The idea of a moon base was an element of George W. Bush's policy and Nasa has detailed plans for a base which was to be constructed by 2024.

Those plans were cancelled by Barack Obama's administration.

But it is largely JFK who remembered for pushing funding to allow Neil Armstrong to become the first man to walk on the moon, despite initially being reticent about the space programme.

After twice attempting to secure a joint deal with Soviet Russia, John F. Kennedy made the decision after Yuri Gargarin became the first man into space that America would have to win the race.

Gingrich called the current state of the space programme 'a total mess, an embarrassment' at the Florida event.

Nasa's conceptual designs for a planned 'lunar outpost': The agency says that vehicles carrying four astronauts would shuttle to and forth to the moon, building permanent structures

The Lunar Electric Rover is a small pressurized concept rover about the size of a pickup truck (with 12 wheels) and can house two astronauts for up to 14 days with sleeping and sanitary facilities

He said: 'By the end of my second term, we need to have the first permanent base on the moon, and it will be American.

'We will have commercial near-Earth 
activities that include science, tourism and manufacturing and are 
designed to create a robust industry precisely on the model of the 
development of the airlines in the 1930s.

'Because it is in our interest to 
acquire so much experience in space that we clearly have a capacity that
the Chinese and Russians will never come anywhere close to matching.'

He said it would take $450billion to 
get a man on Mars and called for 10 per cent of Nasa's budget to be set 
aside to encourage competition.

The Altair lunar lander will be capable of landing four astronauts on the moon, providing life support and a base for weeklong initial surface exploration missions, and returning the crew to the Orion spacecraft that will bring them home to Earth

Responding to criticism that he was 
being 'grandiose', Gingrich told the Washington Post: 'The Wright 
Brothers standing at Kitty Hawk were grandiose. John F. Kennedy was 
grandiose.

'I accept the charge that I am grandiose and that Americans are instinctively grandiose.'

It comes as Gingrich and rival Mitt Romney neck-and-neck in polls in Florida ahead of the fourth Republican primary on Tuesday.

Gingrich had been lagging behind, but has closed the gap on Romney after winning the primary in South Carolina.
