The mother of a British soldier who is returning home after going to  fight  ISIS in Syria says she is relieved that her 'Rambo' is safe - but admits he has been 'bloody stupid'.

The 19-year-old private, who is serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was being flown home last night after being found near the border between Syria and Iraq. 

Last night, his mother said she was 'extremely angry' with her son, but dubbed him 'Rambo' after saying he was brave.

Rambo is a film series about a troubled Vietnam War veteran, played by Sylvester Stallone.

She said: 'Rambo is coming home. I've asked them to leave me in a room with him for two minutes. It's the same scenario as when your child runs in the road and you grab them and smack them for doing something so bloody stupid.

'I'm extremely angry with him, but for someone to do that shows they have balls.'  

It was reported on Thursday that the teenager had left his base after telling his family he was joining the Kurdish Peshmerga in their battle against the extremist group because 'these guys need our help'.

The soldier, from East Sussex, was in Dubai on leave from his base in Cyprus when he decided to travel to the war-torn country.   

He was the first British soldier to have gone to fight against the terror group and his disappearance fuelled fears that he could have been a prime beheading target for Islamist jihadists.

But he was reportedly found 'safe and well' near the front line in Kurdistan after his fellow rebel fighters revealed his location.

Diplomats then got in touch with Peshmerga forces, who arranged for him to be dropped off at the British Consul in Erbil, where an officer from his regiment was waiting.

It is not known whether or not he will face formal disciplinary action, as he was on leave at the time of his disappearance, but if he is charged with going AWOL or desertion he could be sentenced to detention or imprisonment.

Desertion carries a maximum sentence of life in prison if the serviceman involved is judged to have been avoiding active service, while going AWOL or failing to attend for duty can bring a two-year sentence.

However, hundreds of troops go AWOL each year without facing any disciplinary action, and according to the latest available figures the most severe sentence handed out for desertion in recent years was 18 months at the military detention centre in Colchester. 

The private, who disappeared last week, is serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon had yesterday told the Commons that the serving soldier, who has not been identified, had been found and was being returned to his unit.

He said: 'The House may also want to know the soldier reported as missing last week has now been located and is being returned to his unit.' 

The MoD had previously said they would not send police to the Middle East looking for him. Yesterday, a defence source said: 'We are just grateful to have him back at the moment.' 

The soldier left his base after sending a message to his family saying: 'I'm with other British people and a Canadian at the moment. I don't know how to explain it to you but I really want and need to do this and I will be safe.

He added: 'I have good skills and I can speak the language, I can help these people and help with this fight. I will get in trouble for being AWOL, but it's minor and no prison sentence.'  

The private joined up at the age of 16 after leaving school and had reportedly been learning Arabic.

He was said to have once shared a barracks with murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby.

He is understood to have visited the area with the military for a training exercise before he decided to return to fight. 

The serviceman, who has not been named for security reasons, was stationed in Cyprus and travelled to the region via Dubai while on annual leave

He is thought to have been fighting alongside a group called Lions Of Rojava, who have Americans, Canadians and other Britons among their number. 

The soldier reportedly posted a picture online over the weekend showing him standing next to Canadian ex-serviceman Brandon Glossop.

In the post, he referred to Glossop as his 'wingman' and, in a message to his family, added: 'I'm all safe guys.' 

The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment are based at the Tower of London, where the soldier will return to find out whether he faces a court martial.  

In December it emerged that two former British soldiers had travelled to Syria to fight against ISIS after feeling 'compelled' to take up arms following the murder of aid volunteer Alan Henning.

News of the soldier came as the Defence Secretary was urged to clarify exactly what Britain's plan is for the campaign against ISIS in Iraq.

Labour MP John Woodcock said it was troubling defence chiefs had failed to outline the objectives for the campaign against ISIS, also known as Isil, in recent evidence to a Commons committee.

Speaking at Commons defence questions, the Barrow and Furness MP Mr Woodcock said: 'Do you think it is acceptable none of the service chiefs who gave evidence to the defence committee's recent inquiry was willing or able to articulate the UK's objective or strategic plan in Iraq? What is our plan exactly?'

Mr Fallon replied: 'Our plan in Iraq is very simple - it is to disrupt threats to the UK mainland and our interests overseas, secondly it is as part of an international coalition to defeat Isil, including discrediting its violent ideology.

'It is thirdly to mitigate the impact of Isil and other violent extremist groups on the stability of the region as a whole.'  

It is understood the British soldier joined a group called the Lions Of Rojava, who boast, 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.'

They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists.

Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds.

Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight.

Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora.

Last August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. 

Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance.

But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava.

Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities. 

Last October it was reported that a currently serving British Royal Marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave.

The 22-year-old Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups.

Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists.

It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict.

There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance.

Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons.

The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.
