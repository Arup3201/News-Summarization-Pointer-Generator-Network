A teacher who was a finalist for the Challenger space mission has spoken of her devastation as she watched the rocket explode in the sky, on the 27th anniversary of the disaster today.

Gloria Mrs McMillan, 68, was among crowds at Cape Canaveral on January 28, 1986 who watched in horror at the space shuttle burst into flames, killing everyone on board - including teacher Christa McAuliffe who was taking part in a first-of-its-kind program.

Mrs McMillan, who has retired from 
teaching high school in La Jolla, California, said that Christa had the 
short-lived joy of fulfilling all of their hopes - being the 
first teacher in space.

Escape: Gloria McMillan, 69, was one of the finalists for the teacher-in-space program in 1986. She watched in horror as the space shuttle Challenger crashed seconds after take-off from Cape Canaveral

Tragedy: It is the 27th anniversary of the Challenger explosion which killed all crew (l-r) 'teacher-in-space' Christa McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik, Francis Scobee, Ronald McNair, Mike Smith and Ellison Onizuka

The married mother-of-two told U-T San Diego that she returned to her classroom the day after the tragedy, feeling that it was important to comfort students who had followed every step of her adventure.

Waiting for her at home was a letter from Christa McAuliffe, from New Hampshire, filled with excitement about her space voyage and wishing her love.

McAuliffe's unique trip, where she had planned to teach American students from space, gained the space program much publicity particularly because Mrs McAuliffe had an immediate rapport with the media. She beat 11,000 others to the opportunity.

Part of the craze surrounding the 'citizen astronaut' was the reason why so many people watched the launch first-hand - including many school children who had followed the teachers' journey.

Mrs McMillan said: 'It was important for me to be in the
classroom and to be able to deal with the students who were grieving. It was my responsibility to help the students understand that
you don’t give up.

'As soon as I came in, there were hugs all around for me.'

Trip of a lifetime: One teacher Christa McAuliffe joined six astronauts on the 1986 voyage

Horror: Picture taken by NASA showing the solid fuel rocket booster of the space shuttle Challenger starting to explode over Kennedy Space Center

Explosion: The Space Shuttle orbiter Challenger is destroyed shortly after it lifted off from Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida on January 28, 1986

Tragedy: A thick cloud of engine exhaust, solid rocket booster plume, and expanding gas fill the sky above the Kennedy Space Center as thousands gathered to watch the historic space mission raised their eyes in dread

She said that her students were essential in helping her come to terms with the tragedy as they made posters, wrote poems and essays to honor the Challenger seven.

The 68-year-old, like many others involved in the program, has for years been struck by the thought 'what if it were me' - every time that the anniversary of the Challenger disaster rolls around.

One teacher who spoke to the San Diego paper said that she 'almost wish it had been me'  - as McAuliffe was the only finalist who had children.

Excitement: The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger make their way to the launchpad for the doomed voyage

More than 100 of those finalists who applied for the teacher-in-space program watched from grandstands three miles from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida as the shuttle exploded.

All seven Challenger crewmembers - McAuliffe, Michael J. Smith, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Judith Resnik - perished in the disaster.

However Mrs McMillan never lost her love for space which she shared with hundreds of students saying that in honor of the mission it was important to show that it had meaning towards humanity's progress in space.
