A former supermodel who had £83,000 seized by police as part of an investigation into her criminal ex-boyfriend is trying to reclaim the cash which she says was given to her by a 'wealthy' friend.

Oxana Zubakova said the money was not the result of a £50million money laundering scheme spearheaded by her former partner, Tarik Mehgrabi, but was given to her by another man who 'funded her lavish lifestyle'.

Meghrabi was jailed in February after police raided 6,000 safety deposit boxes held across London - some of which the Syrian criminal shared with his then girlfriend, Ms Zubakova.

The 37-year-old is now trying to reclaim money and jewellery seized from one such box, claiming much of it came from Spanish businessman, Miguel Buadas, and the rest from earnings throughout her high-flying career.

Giving evidence via video link at the Old Bailey today, the former athlete and Dior model said there was 'no truth' in claims Mehgrabi funded her jet-setting lifestyle which saw her travel 'every two to three weeks'.

The 37-year-old former model said a wealthy businessman funded her lavish lifestyle after the pair met in Majorca in 2004

Instead, she said Buadas gave her cash to fund her lifestyle since the pair met in Majorca in 2004.

When asked by prosecutors why she failed to mention the 'well established' man previously, Ms Zubakova  said he 'would not have appreciated an investigation into his life.'

Rupert Jones, for the Serious Organised Crime Agency said: 'But you're happy to give that explanation now aren't you?'

'I have to,' Ms Zubakova replied, adding she was able to withdraw money from accounts held by Buadas in Russia.

A panel of justices heard  today she once bought a £112,000 Mercedes with cash, and withdrew £85,000 in a single week.

Ms Zubakova cited travel as the reason she carried so much cash, saying: 'I would go to Spain, Italy, France where I have a lot of friends. I have cash with me all the time...I've had cash all my life.'

The court heard how the model opened the security box in 2007, and listed Meghrabi as an additional user though he scarcely accessed it.

The box contained £83,000 worth of 500 euro notes, a £5,500 Tiffany pendant and an £11,000 Cartier necklace.

The prosecution made clear the claimant, who is suing police for the forfeit of such assets,  was not a suspect in the original investigation but a 'key witness'.

Judge Mr Levett will give his ruling on Monday.
