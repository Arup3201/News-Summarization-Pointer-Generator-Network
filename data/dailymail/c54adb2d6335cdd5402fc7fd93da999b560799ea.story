A renown costume designer and cosplayer who was in New York for Comic Con is speaking out after she was groped twice over the weekend, once while wearing a poncho.

Yaya Han has been dressing up characters from video games, anime and movies for 15 years and is now an internationally recognized personality in cosplaying.

Over the weekend, she took to Facebook to reveal that she was groped by people on the street blocks away from the convention.

In costume: Yaya Han, an internationally known cosplayer who designs costumes and models, says she was groped twice in New York City

'I know there is a huge percentage of folks out there who believe that female cosplayers often bring unwanted attention onto themselves by the costume and appearance choices they make,' she wrote.

'As in - if you don't want to be disrespected, don't dress that way,' she added. 'I have never agreed with that mindset, but given some of the cleavage-bearing costumes I wear, my opinion usually gets discredited and I'm labeled as a hypocrite.'

She describes a stranger grabbing her on the west side of Manhattan. She says she was dressed as a superhero in a black bodysuit, but that she had draped a cape over herself that covered her cleavage.

She later spoke with the Daily Dot and described how the person who assaulted her blended into the crowds of the city and how she felt unsafe. 

'It’s like you are with hundreds of people right by you, but you’re completely alone in the world and you’re completely lost,' she said. 'You don’t know how to solve the problem.'

Worse, it happened again the very next day when she was walking back from a musical on Broadway, this time while she was wearing a head-to-toe poncho.

Player: Han is one of a few people in the world earning a significant income from cosplaying, though she says she still designs costumes of her own for fun

Superhero: Han spoke up after she was groped while wearing a superhero costume on the streets of New York, saying she was covering her cleavage with a cape

Targeted: Han says she wants people to stop targeting women and saying they 'deserve' assault because they're showing skin

'No cleavage, not even any shape showing. Tonight's groper actually missed my bikini area because of the poncho,' she wrote on Facebook.

Han says that conventions have actually changed in recent years to provide safe spaces for people to dress up without fear of harassment, though when she shares stories like hers, not all of her fans seem to want to listen.

Han said that after she shared a video of Anita Sarkeesian, a critic of sexualized violence and objectification in video games who has been the target of death threats, to Facebook, she immediately lost almost 1,000 followers.

'All that hate,' Han said. 'You don’t deserve death threats, to have violence threatened against you… I don’t care what these women did, you don’t treat human beings that say.'
