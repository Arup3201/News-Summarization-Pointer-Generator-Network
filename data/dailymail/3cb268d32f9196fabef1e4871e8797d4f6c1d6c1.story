Would-be princesses will find that fairy tales can come true - as long as they have £2million to spend on their very own seven-bedroom castle which comes complete with turrets and romantic gardens.

With its ornate brickwork, balconies, arrow-slits and a turreted tower bedroom fit for any Sleeping Beauty, turn-of-the-century Carfield Castle, in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, could have popped off the pages of a children's storybook.

The castle was built in 1901 and during the First World War was used as a temporary billet for officers.

Now the building, up for sale with estate agents Strutt and Parker, has been restored to combine its original 
fairy-tale grandeur with a beautiful seven-bedroom home.

On arrival, potential owners will make their way through electrically operated wrought iron gates and past an ornamental fountain before taking in the mansion's  glass atrium, original parquet flooring in the hallway, and a spectacular Royal Doulton fireplace... all that's missing is Prince Charming.

Fit for a princess: Carfield Castle, a stunning seven-bedroom mansion, comes complete with turrets and romantic gardens

Open the gates: Electrically operated wrought iron gates lead to a gravelled driveway and elegant turning area around an ornamental fountain

Sleeping Beauty: This turreted bedroom overlooks the home's sprawling gardens, and would be the perfect place for a princess to catch 40 winks, or sleep for 100 years

Be our guest: This large dining room would be the perfect setting for many a royal banquet... either with or without a talking candelabra

Take the throne: Modern day princesses could swap their throne for a comfy sofa and relax in this stylish living room at the house in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire

Lap of luxury: This living room would be the perfect spot to await any Prince Charming who might be on his way to the castle

Keys to the kingdom: On entering the property guests will see that the handsome house still has its original parquet flooring in the hallway

Making an entrance: A sweeping staircase leads from the entrance hall to the turreted bedrooms upstairs. The building, up for sale with estate agents Strutt and Parker has recently been restored

Enchanted: This sprawling garden, complete with rose covered archways and a large patio area would be the perfect place for a romantic stroll

A whole new world: The castle was built in 1901 and during the First World War it was used as a temporary billet for officers
