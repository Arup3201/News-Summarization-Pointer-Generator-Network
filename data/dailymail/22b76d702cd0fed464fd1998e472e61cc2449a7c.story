Authorities confirmed on Thursday that the bodies of a man and woman found at a suburban Dallas home are those of the parents of a 10-year-old boy found dead in a bathtub at the house in January — a death for which the mother was charged with murder.

The Collin County medical examiner confirmed that the bodies found Wednesday are those of Sumeet Dhawan, 43, and Pallavi Dhawan, 39, Frisco police said in a statement. Police have not said if the death might have been caused by suicide or murder suicide.

Pallavi Dhawan had been free on $50,000 bond after Frisco police charged her with murder in the death of the Dhawans' son, Arnav. A medical examiner's report had said a natural cause was the most likely cause of the child's death. However, police had said Pallavi Dhawan had confessed to killing the boy — something the family's attorney, David Finn of Dallas, has strenuously denied.

Officers had found Pallavi Dhawan's body in the family's backyard pool and Sumeet Dhawan's body in the house. Police are not saying how they died, and Finn said he had not been told if any marks were found on their bodies.

Assistant Police Chief Darren Stevens said the department has been in contact with the extended Dhawan family 'and are doing everything possible to keep them informed over the course of this investigation.'

Officers had found Arnav's body on Jan. 29 while making a welfare check at the house. He was wrapped in a cloth up to the neck, and there were empty plastic bags in the tub next to him.

A police affidavit says Sumeet Dhawan told investigators that his wife was having mental health issues and that they had been having marital problems.

Since Pallavi Dhawan's release on bond, Finn had expressed impatience with the police handling of their investigation in light of the medical examiner's findings.

Finn has said that Arnav was a special-needs child, born with a brain cyst and microcephaly, a condition characterized by an abnormally small head, which could have factored in his death.

On Thursday, however, Finn acknowledged: 'I'm not sure that we'll ever know what happened.'

Finn said he had been in contact with Sumeet Dhawan's relatives, who hope to send the bodies back to India for cremation in accordance with Hindu tradition. It's not clear if the bodies are in a condition suitable for the trip. If they aren't, 'they'll be cremated and the ashes sent back to India,' Finn said.

FOX reports that the couple's attorney David Finn said that Pallavi's mother had contacted him from India to ask him to help in bringing Pallavi's and Sumeet's remains home for cremation.

Finn said that he spoke with the couple days before their death and that he didn't notice any changes in behavior.

However, he did say that Pallavi was under great stress during the investigation and that Sumeet told Frisco police that his wife had been depressed perhaps suicidal.

Pallavi wanted to travel to a city in India to pray for her dead son but she was unable to get a passport due to her pending criminal case.

'That's where it's believed that, if you go to only these specific cities, those are the preeminent spots, and if you do it for your loved ones, they'll get peace, Sumeet told FOX in February.

Fox spoke with SMU theology professor Robert Hunt about the cultural importance of honoring the dead and about times when the Hindu religion allows for suicide.

'It's not only critically important as they think hopefully about the soul of the departed person, but this becomes a dangerous entity in a sense for the family, and to a certain extent brings an amount of shame and guilt to the family in terms of their wider relations,' said Robert Hunt.

'The very fact of being charged, the very fact of having an investigation go to a grand jury can being a deep sense of guilt and shame that, for an American, isn't going to be the first thing that happens,' said Hunt.

He said that the Hindu belief generally rejects suicide but in some cases relating to great injustice, suicide if forgivable or even the right thing to do.

'Generally speaking, the cause of it, or the ostensible cause of it, is, and what makes it right, I should say, is that it calls attention to a grave injustice,' said Hunter.

'It becomes the only way that a completely powerless person can say, ‘This is unjust.'” 

Charged: Pallavi Dhawan, now dead, was a suburban Dallas mother, charged with murdering her 10-year-old son Arnav Dhawan

Mystery: Even though Arnav's mother was charged with his murder, it is likely he died of natural causes
