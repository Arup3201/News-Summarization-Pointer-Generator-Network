Disapproving: Top Gear presenter said that the festival is marred by violence and arrests

The Notting Hill carnival is now ‘like being in Soviet Russia’, with police helicopters circling overhead and sirens blaring, Jeremy Clarkson has claimed.

The August Bank Holiday festival, which attracts one million revellers every year, has been marred by violence and drunkenness in recent years.

At this year’s two-day event, more than 300 people were arrested and a further 300 were treated by the emergency services.

The Top Gear presenter said that, far from being a ‘gooey muddle of love’, the event was now dominated by police officers trying to keep the peace.

Clarkson suggested that the event was only allowed to continue because it was seen as a celebration of ‘multiculturalism’.

Writing in a newspaper column, he said that politicians were eager to promote Notting Hill Carnival as ‘a tremendous event which brings us all together in a gooey muddle of love and music and strangely-scented tobacco’.

Clarkson wrote: ‘Afterwards, the police always tell us that it was very ‘peaceful’ and then they post amusing videos on YouTube, showing officers dancing with the crowds and ‘twerking’. Lovely.

‘But from where I was sitting, about a mile down the road, it sounded like I was on the set of Hill Street Blues.

‘Every few moments a cop car screamed past, its siren blaring and then, before it had faded into the distance, a convoy of ambulances roared by, their lights flashing.

‘Meanwhile, high in the sky a police surveillance helicopter spent all day hovering over the same spot, its camera pointed ominously into the crowds. It was like being in Soviet Russia.’ ‘Peaceful? Doesn’t sound that way to me.’

Justification: Clarkson suggested that the event was only allowed to continue because it was seen as a celebration of ‘multiculturalism’

Pictures from this year’s carnival 
captured rows of men urinating in the streets and revellers passed out 
drunk on the pavements.

Police
officers were photographed separating topless men as they fought with 
each other, and grappling a man to the ground as they handcuffed him.

Clarkson added: ‘If there were 300 arrests at a football match and 300 injuries, there would be hell to pay.

‘There’d
be bans and fines and the club would be told that unless they bucked 
their ideas up, there would be no more football in their stadium until 
the end of time.

‘But of course, the Notting Hill Carnival is the shining jewel in the crown of multiculturalism.

‘So it was peaceful and wonderful and everyone got on terribly well.’ In total, 301 people were arrested, 23 more than the previous year.

Of these, 96 were held for drug crimes and 64 for public order offences, while others were arrested for carrying weapons, assaults on police officers and grievous bodily harm.

There were three sex attacks, and more than 300 people were treated for cuts, bruises and alcohol-related injuries.

The Metropolitan Police said 6,000 officers were on duty at the carnival on Sunday and just under 7,000 on Bank Holiday Monday.

In June 2011, 16-year-old Junior Henry stabbed Rio Andre, 20, during a gang clash at the carnival.

Henry was photographed running away from Mr Andre with a bloodied knife after stabbing him in the abdomen, in an image that shocked the world.

The carnival is the largest street festival in Europe and originated in 1964 as a way for Afro-Caribbean communities to celebrate their cultures and traditions.
