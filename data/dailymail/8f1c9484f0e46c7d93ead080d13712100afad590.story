Joel Campbell's agent has blasted Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for not allowing the forward leave the club this summer.

Joaquim Batica has questioned Wenger's motives over the Costa Rica star after denying the 22-year-old a move to Portuguese giants Benfica on transfer deadline day.

Wenger has reiterated a desire to keep Campbell following his impressive loan spell at Olympiacos last season and his good World Cup, where he played a key role in his nation reaching the quarter-finals before losing to Holland on penalties.

Unhappy: Joel Campbell's agent has blasted Arsene Wenger over his treatment of his client

But he has only played 16 minutes of Premier League football this season and Batica is quoted in O Jogo as saying: 'Benfica fought until the last minute to sign Campbell but the move didn’t happen because, in the last hour, Arsenal decided to keep him.

'Wenger says he did not want to sell him. But if he is not in his plans, then why not allow him to leave?'  

The £16million arrival of Danny Welbeck from Premier League rivals Manchester United has also cast doubt over Campbell's future with him now seemingly behind Welbeck, Yaya Sanogo and the injured Olivier Giroud in the striking pecking order. 

Welbeck, meanwhile, could not be happier to be at Arsenal, telling the club's website: 'It's exciting times for me.

'It's great to be a part of this club and it's a team that I've always watched in the Premier League. I've envisaged myself playing in this team before. For it to finally happen is very exciting.'
