They're ready to say ‘eh-oh’ to a whole new generation of viewers.

The Teletubbies are staging a comeback –  sending much-loved characters Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po on new adventures more than a decade after the series ended.

The show for pre-schoolers will return for a further 60 episodes on BBC digital channel CBeebies. Programme makers say it will be ‘visually enhanced’ with a ‘contemporary look’ along with computer animation.

There will also be some CGI animation used in the production.

Originally created by production company Ragdoll, the rights have gone on to be acquired by DHX Media.

The new series is to be made by TV firm Darrall Macqueen, which has been behind children's TV shows Baby Jake and Topsy And Tim.

Darrall Macqueen executive producer Maddy Darrall said working on 
the show was 'like being handed the television crown jewels'.

New shows: The Teletubbies on top of the Tubbytronic Superdrome in Teletubbyland. No shows have been made for 10 years even though it was always popular with children

CBeebies controller Kay Benbow said: 'Teletubbies is an enduringly popular series with our youngest viewers, although no new episodes have been made for over 10 years.

'I think that now is the right time to create new episodes of this much-loved, iconic show for the current CBeebies audience.

'I’m sure they will engage with and delight in the activities of Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po, in the same way that children and parents did when they first appeared on our screens.'
