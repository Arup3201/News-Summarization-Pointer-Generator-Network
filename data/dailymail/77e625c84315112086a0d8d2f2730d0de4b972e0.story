Israeli fighter jets have bombed warehouses they believed were holding military equipment used to launch chemical weapons.

Israelis officials confirmed the raid and said the targets were  'game-changing' weapons bound for the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group.

The airstrike happened in the early hours of Friday, but the Israeli officials did not say where it took place.

It followed days of heightened concerns that Syria might be using chemical weapons against opposition forces.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly warned in 
recent weeks that Israel would be prepared to take military action if 
chemical weapons or other arms were to reach Hezbollah.

In January, an Israeli airstrike hit a convoy believed to be carrying advanced anti-aircraft weapons to Hezbollah.

Earlier this week, Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan 
Nasrallah said his group would aid Syrian President Bashar Assad if 
needed to put down the two -year-old uprising.

Lebanon's army released a statement saying Israeli warplanes had flown over Lebanese airspace for hours during Friday. President Michel Suleiman denounced the flights and accused Israel of breaking international law.

President Obama: No 'American boots' on the ground in Syria

The statements did not mention possible strikes against Syria.

An Israeli embassy spokesman in Washington declined to comment on the air strike.

But he added: 'What we can say is that Israel is determined to prevent the transfer of chemical weapons or other game-changing weaponry by the Syrian regime to terrorists, especially to Hezbollah in Lebanon.'

In 2007, Israeli jets bombed a 
suspected nuclear reactor site along the Euphrates River in northeastern
 Syria, an attack that embarrassed and jolted the Assad regime.

It led 
to a build-up of the Syrian air defense system with Russia providing the 
hardware for the defense systems upgrade. It continues to be a reliable 
supplier of military equipment to the Assad regime.

The airstrike, first reported by CNN, 
came hours before President Barack Obama  told a press conference in Costa Rica that did not expect the U.S. to send ground troops into Syria.

He said: 'I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on the ground, would not only be good for America but also would be good for Syria.'

More than 70,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled the country as the Assad regime has fought rebels.

Mr Obama has called evidence of the use of chemical weapons a 'game-changer' that would have 'enormous consequences'.

The Israeli airstrikes are believed to be part of a cautious, step-by-step plan in Washington to rally support for an international momentum which supports the rebels in Syria.

While the U.S. has been providing 
non-lethal aid to opposition forces in Syria, stepping up support in 
recent days, the Obama administration has resisted calls from some 
American politicians to arm the rebels, or work to establish a no-fly 
zone to aid the insurgency.

Israel struck on the same day that reports of the most gruesome massacre filtered through to western media of ‘assassinations’ and ‘burning’ of bodies on a city near the port of Baniyas.

Assad's regime was accused of committing a 'large-scale massacre' of up to 100 men, women and children with guns, knives and blunt objects.

The killings were targeted at the village of Bayda which is inhabited primarily by Sunnis, who dominate the country's rebel movement.

On Thursday, Defense 
Secretary Chuck Hagel said the administration is rethinking its 
opposition to providing arms to the rebels. He said it was one of 
several options as the U.S. consults with allies about steps to be taken
 to drive Assad from power.

Officials in the administration who spoke on
 condition of anonymity to discuss strategy said earlier this week that 
arming the opposition forces was seen as more likely than any other 
military option.

Obama followed Hagel's comments by 
saying options will continue to be evaluated, though he did not cite 
providing arms specifically.

Concerns that U.S. weapons could end up in 
the hands of al-Qaida-linked groups helping the Syrian opposition or 
other extremists, including Hezbollah, have stood in the way of that 
change in strategy.

"We want to make sure that we look 
before we leap and that what we're doing is actually helpful to the 
situation as opposed to making it more deadly or more complex," Mr Obama 
said.
