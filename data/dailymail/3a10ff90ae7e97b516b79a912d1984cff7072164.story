Pessimistic pundits suggest the Lib Dems' chances of survival are already non-existent.

But senior minister Danny Alexander is pinning his hopes on a mythical beast to save his Inverness seat, using £2million in taxpayers' money.

The Chief Secretary to the Treasury today announced the tourism cash to promote the home of the Loch Ness monster  in the latest example of money being funnelled towards his ultra-marginal constituency.

With less than four months until the election, Danny Alexander has found £2million in public money to promote Loch Ness in his constiuency

Mr Alexander, the MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, has faced repeated claims he is shoring up votes in his Highlands seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere.

In the past cash has been found for a tax break for ski-lifts, a bail-out for a sleeper train from London to Scotland and green levies scrapped for a tourist train in the Cairngorms. More money was also found to to fund exceptions to housing benefit than any other council. 

Earlier this year, a deal was also secured to hand a 5p petrol rebate to motorists in rural areas, including parts of constituencies represented by LibDem MPs Charles Kennedy, John Thurso, and Mr Alexander. 

Today Nick Clegg unveiled plans to funnel hundreds of millions of pounds under a 'city deal' for Inverness, where Mr Alexander is expected to face a major challenge from the SNP.

The SNP last night questioned the timing of the announcement, which could be worth £300million for the region, warning against a 'desperate ploy' by the Lib Dems to reverse a catastrophic collapse in the polls.

In the latest announcement which is sure to rouse suspicions of special treatment for Mr Alexander's constituency, he trumpeted extra cash to promote Loch Ness around the world.

The Treasury issued a press notice declaring that the 'iconic landmark Loch Ness will benefit from an extra £2million government investment to boost inbound tourism'. 

The campaign promises 'extensive advertising, digital and business to business activity launched in key tourism markets featuring the famed Loch Ness monster until 2019'. 

Mr Alexander said: 'I'm delighted to provide £2m for a four year campaign to promote one of the most beautiful parts of the UK. 

'The Loch is a jewel in the crown of the Highlands tourism industry, which creates and sustains many jobs in Scotland. 

'Around the world, Loch Ness is one of the best known places in the UK, so it's right we place it the heart of our international tourism campaign.'  

The LibDems have an 8,765 majority in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, however the party's share of the vote is expected to collapse in May.

Mr Clegg's comments come after plans were unveiled for a similar 'city deal' in Glasgow shortly before last year's independence referendum – which was dependent on a No vote.

The Deputy Prime Minister told The Press and Journal newspaper: 'I'm not sure if we will definitely be able to confirm City Deals in Inverness and Aberdeen before the election, but I would really like us to do so.

'If we could, I would be very keen to do so. I don't think that because a city deal works for Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester, that they should be confined to those cities.'

He added 'It's great that we managed to get one delivered for Glasgow, and they were very quick off the mark by the way, I was really impressed by the city leaders in Glasgow.

'I think it's a positive thing that others are now trying to follow suit.'

The money could be used to help fund a new sports centre, a visitor attraction at Inverness Castle and a major cultural development. It has been claimed such a deal would be worth £300million to the area in new funding, borrowing powers and spin-off investment.

Drew Hendry, Highland Council Leader and SNP Westminster candidate for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: 'Of course everyone will be pleased that the UK government is at long last apparently looking to invest in Inverness – the £300million city deal initiative is something that I have been calling for over a year - I have twice written to Danny Alexander about it, but I received no response.

'My concern of this announcement is in the timing so near to the General Election - efforts to make Inverness the great Highland capital it deserves to be must not be compromised by the LibDems in a desperate ploy to try and reverse their collapse in support.'

But Danny Alexander said: 'Like the Deputy Prime Minister, I am a strong advocate of city deals. They are a great Liberal Democrat initiative for unleashing growth and opportunity.

'To be successful, a lot of people and organisations need to come together and it's really important that we get things right, so I'm delighted that early work is already underway and I'm pressing across government for swift progress.'

A Highland Liberal Democrat spokesman added: 'Only the SNP could try to make the prospect of £300million of investment in Inverness a reason to be miserable.

'Danny has been working closely with Councillor Thomas Prag, who is driving the project forward for the Highland Council, and hopes to facilitate a meeting with the Cities Unit to progress the deal in the near future.'

The announcement comes just days after coalition ministers were accused of effectively trying to bribe voters by showering cash on marginal seats. The claim came as they fanned out across the country to promote details of a new £36million investment in coastal areas.

Of the 28 identifiable constituencies receiving money, almost two-thirds are in marginal constituencies. Some 23 of the 28 seats are held by coalition parties in areas such as Lancashire, Kent and Devon.

Labour Cabinet Office spokesman Jon Ashworth said ministers appeared to be pursuing 'pork barrel politics' – a reference to the US practice of effectively bribing voters by pouring money into marginal seats.
