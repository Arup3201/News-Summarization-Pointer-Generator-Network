A woman who spent 20 years searching for her long-lost brother was reunited with him at the U.S. prison where he is serving life for murder.

Natasha Owen Jones, 31, of Ilford in Essex, has been trying to find her brother, Morgan Schulz, since she discovered his existence as a child.

The pair were adopted at a very young age after their mother died of a drugs overdose and their father went to prison.

Natasha thought she was an orphan and an only child but when she was 10 she found a file on her adoptive dad's desk that showed she has a brother.

It emerged that her Turkish father had left her a letter outlining how he and her biological mother gave them up for adoption so they had a better chance in life.

After some detective work she found her father and then the social worker who handled the adoptions, who confirmed her brother Laurence had moved to the U.S. and was now called Morgan Schulz.

Natasha was amazed to find the 32-year-old was serving 99 years at a prison in Minnesota for throttling a drug dealer in an argument over cash.

She told the Sunday Mirror: 'To see him after all those years was such an incredible moment.

'We only had an hour together but it seemed to fly by. I know people will think I'm crazy for wanting to have anything to do with Morgan but he is my brother and always will be.'

Now they talk over the phone and Natasha hopes he will be transferred to a UK prison and have his sentence reduced.

He was 21 at the time of the offence and insisted it was an accident that happened while he was high on LSD.

Her story was told in the documentary My Brother, the Murderer on More4.
