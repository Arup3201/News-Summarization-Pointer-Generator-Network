An 88-year-old former member of an SS armored division has been charged with murder and accessory to murder for allegedly taking part in the massacre of 642 French villagers by Nazi soldiers during World War Two.

The man, named only as Werner C, from Cologne, has been charged with 25 counts of murder  and hundreds of counts of accessory to murder in connection with the slaughter in Oradour-sur-Glane.

The investigation into the massacre where almost the entire population of the village, including more than 400 women and children, was gunned down or burned alive on June 10, 1944, was re-opened by German prosecutors last year

On Wednesday, the regional court in 
Cologne said: 'The prosecutor's office in Dortmund has charged an 
88-year-old from Cologne over the murder of 25 people committed by a 
group, and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred 
people.'

The man was named in documents as Werner C, his last name withheld in accordance with German privacy laws.

His lawyer, Rainer Pohlen, said his client was at the village but had nothing to do with the massacre.

More
 than 68 years later, a German prosecutor and senior police officers 
visited the abandoned village in central France, which Hitlers troops 
burned to the ground before they fled.

Last year, German authorities said they believe there may still be six men still at large, 
all now in their late 80s, who were members of SS Panzer Division that 
committed the atrocity. 

Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told French reporters in Oradour: 'We hope the survivors may be able to help us identify any culprits who are still alive'

More than 400 women and children were herded into the village church where SS troops soaked the 
church pews with petrol and barred all exits before setting it on fire.

Only one woman managed to escape the flames.

More
 than 200 men were herded into a barn where machine gunners opened fire,
 shooting at their legs so they could not move then dousing them with 
petrol and setting them alight.

Robert Hebras, 87 - was one of only 
six villagers who escaped the carnage - said: 'It is a very strange 
moment to see German officials here 68 years later'

French historian Guy Perlier told Le Figaro newspaper, 'This 
illustrates German thinking which insists on shedding light on all acts 
committed by the German army during this period'

Early on the morning of 10 June 1944, the 2nd SS Panzer Division entered the village of Oradour-sur-Glane to avenge the death of a German officer who had been kidnapped by the French Resistance.

They marched into the town and separated the men from the women and children.

The men were taken to six barns and shed while the women and children were locked in the church while the village was looted.

The men were said to be shot in the legs before being doused in petrol and set alight.

Six men escaped although one was later found nearby and shot dead. In total 190 men perished.

The soldiers proceeded to the church and tried to set it alight. Women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows of the church, but were met with machine-gun fire.

A total of 247 women and 205 children died. Two women and one child survived; one was 47-year-old Marguerite Rouffanche. She hauled herself out of a window behind the altar, followed by a young woman and child. German soldiers shot all three of them, killing the woman and child by wounding Rouffanche who escaped into nearby foliage where she stayed until she was rescued the following day.

The following is part of her testimony read out to the 1953 Bordeaux military tribunal:

'Firing burst out in the church then straw, faggots and chairs were thrown pele-mele onto bodies lying on the stone slabs. I had escaped from the killing and was without injury so I made use of a smoke cloud to slip behind the altar. In this part of the church there are three windows. I made for the widest one in the middle and with the help of a stool used to light the candles, I tried to reach it. I don't know how but my strength was multiplied. I heaved myself up to it as best I could and threw myself out of the opening that was offered to me through the already shattered window. I jumped about nine feet down.

'When I looked up I saw I had been followed in my climb by a woman holding out her baby to me. She fell down next to me but the Germans, alerted by the cries of the baby, machine-gunned us. The woman and the mite were killed and I too was injured as I made it to a neighbouring garden and hid among some rows of peas and waited anxiously for someone to come to help me. That wasn't until the following day at 5 p.m.'

Although several probes have previously been opened into the massacre, they had to be shut down due to a lack of evidence, and many of the Germans involved in the atrocity, including senior officers, were soon killed in the Battle of Normandy.

But
 when a historian in 2010 discovered documents implicating all six 
suspects, still alive and now aged between 85 and 86, the case had 
enough evidence to be re-opened.

Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel said that the aim of last year's visit, 
the first by German investigators since World War Two was to identify 
the exact locations where the SS unit was deployed and interview 
witnesses to the massacre.

Camille Senon, one of the survivors who witnessed the aftermath of 
the massacre in which her family members died, said: ‘It is considered 
 a positive gesture by the Germans to send investigators for the first 
time, 68 years after, even though I would have liked to have seen it 
happen sooner’.

In September, Joachim Gauck became the first German leader to visit the French 'ghost' village.The highly symbolic visit was as much a part of France's willingness to face up to its wartime past as Germany's.

Thousands of French including police and railwaymen participated in the Nazi Holocaust, while collaboration with military units like the SS was also rife.

French President Francois Hollande and Mr Gauck were accompanied by two of only three living survivors of the Oradour massacre, including Robert Hebras, 88.

Mr Hebras, who was 19 at the time, hid under the corpses of others who were machine-gunned.

'I was consumed by hatred and vengeance for a long time,' said Mr Hebras, adding: 'We must reconcile with the Germans.'
