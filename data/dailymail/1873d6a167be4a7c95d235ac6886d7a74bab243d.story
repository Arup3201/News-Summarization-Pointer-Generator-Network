It was a terrifying near-repeat of the ordeal of Aron Ralston - the canyoneer who became stuck between two rocks in Utah and inspired the film 127 hours.

This time the real-life drama was played out in rural Victoria, where an Australian rock climber who became trapped between two huge boulders on Mount Arapiles was forced to spend the night in 'very cold' conditions as rescuers worked desperately to free him.

Luckily for the 24-year-old, and unlike Ralston who had to amputate his own arm, his girlfriend was on hand to call authorities and he survived the 10 hours 'wedged' inside the rock with his limbs intact.

No easy feet: Rescuers were forced to improvise with shampoo and other lubricants to free this 24-year-old man from a crevice in Mt Arapiles

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the nearby town of Horsham experienced temperatures around 10C overnight, but conditions on elevated Mt Arapiles were likely much colder. 

Ambulance Victoria officers told the ABC the man was 'extremely hypothermic' and said shampoo, olive oil and other slippery liquids were used to ease the man out of the crevice.

'I believe some of his friends actually went around the campsite at Mt Arapiles waking up a few people just asking for some shampoo or any other lubricants they can find,' Nick Thresher said.

'Funnily enough someone did bring up some motor oil but we declined the use of that one.'

Rock and a hard place: Rescuers brought in large heaters to keep the man warm through the 10 hour ordeal

He told Fairfax radio: 'He's been between two very cold rocks for many, many hours. His blood pressure is improving.'

The Victorian man was attempting a 'squeeze test' at the location, a popular activity in Mt Arapiles where rock climbers attempt to crawl their way through a tiny gap in a cliff known as 'Tiger Wall'. 

The man became wedged by his hips around 10pm on Monday night and was freed around 8am the next morning.

In a multi-unit response, State Emergency Services volunteers, Victorian police, the Country Fire Authority and local rescue specialists were on hand to help paramedics with the rescue.   

Delicate operation: Paramedics were fearful the man would suffer from 'crush syndrome' when he was finally freed

They were worried the man would fall victim to a condition known as 'crush syndrome' - a potentially fatal illness caused by toxins being released into the body rapidly after a significant weight is removed.

It is believed that because the man was wedged between the boulders, and not bearing any weight, he was ultimately not at risk.

The man was medicated during the rescue operation and large heaters were used to prevent him from freezing to death, a police statement read.

He remains in a stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.

The Mt Arapiles squeeze test has plagued climbers in the past and in 2011 a 15-year-old Melbourne boy had to be rescued after getting stuck.
