A Royal Marine who became the first Briton to be killed while fighting against ISIS was laid to rest today as hundreds of Kurdish mourners gathered to pay their respects.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, became the first Briton to be killed fighting the terror group in Syria when he was brought down by mortar fire on March 2. 

Mr Scurfield who was killed while fighting alongside Kurdish forces in the frontline village of Tel Khuzela in Syria was given a hero's send-off by members of the Kurdish community in Nottingham today. 

Before the funeral service his body was brought to St Paul's with St Stephen's Church to allow members of the public and Kurdish community to pay their respects

Mr Scurfield, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21.

However, he fled to Syria to fight alongside the Kurdish forces after becoming ‘horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS’. 

Mr Scurfield's body was flown to Manchester last week because the People’s Protection Unit (YPG), who he was fighting alongside, has a large base in the city.

There were shouts of 'martyr' and 'hero' from the crowd, many of whom carried his picture.

His mother Vasliki said she was proud of the her son for standing up for the freedom of Kurdish people in Syria.

'Although he did not die fighting for a British cause he died representing British values,' she said.

Hozen Kasen, a prominent member of PYD in Manchester, added: 'We are very proud that Konstandinos Erik Scurfield went to represent us in a plight that was not his own.

'He is not just a Kurdish hero but a humanitarian hero and will go down in history as such.' 

Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' 

His family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated to hear of his death. 

They were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine.

Shortly after his death, Mr Scurfield's father Chris and uncle travelled out to Syria to try and repatriate his body. 

In his final Facebook post, Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine, revealed: 'The Corps told my mum and I think she's taken it pretty well, I might even think she is a little bit proud.' 

Mr Scurfield also revealed 'quite a lot of Westerners' pack up and leave after a short time, disappointed by the Kruds' 'skills and drills'.

But Mr Scurfield was impressed by the attitude of the Kurdish fighters - who are the only troops on the ground fighting

'The Kurds don't do stuff like us but they never drip about going on patrol,' he wrote.
