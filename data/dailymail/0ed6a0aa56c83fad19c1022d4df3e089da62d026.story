Everton drew 1-1 with Portuguese giants Porto in Leon Osman's testimonial match at Goodison Park on Sunday.

The Toffees took the lead shortly before half-time as Aiden McGeady intercepted a pass from the Porto goalkeeper and played in Steven Naismith to slot home.

However, Porto levelled on 57 minutes as frontman Jackson Matinez turned to find space in the area to place the ball past goalkeeper Joel Robles following neat build-up play by the visitors.

Osman went close to scoring with 15 minutes to go but saw his shot blocked having been played in by defender Tony Hibbert.

The midfielder was replaced by young frontman Conor McAleny on 87 minutes and went off to a standing ovation after playing over 300 games for the Blues during a 14-year spell on Merseyside.

New £28million signing Romelu Lukaku was unveiled on the pitch at half-time while another summer arrival, Bosnian midfielder Muhamed Besic, endeared himself to the Goodison faithful with a full-blooded challenge on the byline having been introduced after the interval.
