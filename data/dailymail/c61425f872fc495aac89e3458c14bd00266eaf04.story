Hamburg clambered off the bottom of the Bundesliga table as Pierre-Michel Lasogga compounded Borussia Dortmund's poor start to the league season. 

The striker fired past home goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller 10 minutes before the break to score the only goal of the game. 

It is Hamburg's first win of the season and Werder Bremen are now propping up the rest.
