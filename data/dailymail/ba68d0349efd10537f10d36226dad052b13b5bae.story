David Cameron returned to jogging today, despite his admitting to fears his age is catching up with him.

The Prime Minister, who turns 47 next month, has in recent weeks spoken of back pain, bad knees and poor eyesight.

But he shocked passers-by in central London today as he pulled on his trainers and hit the streets with his protection officers.

Hard going: David Cameron seen jogging in London this morning, after complaining of growing old

London: The Prime Minister was seen exercising near Horse Guard's Parade, jogging past tourists

He made running the through Whitehall look harder work than running the country.

Wearing shorts and a black and green running top, Mr Cameron was photographed huffing and puffing his way past Horse Guard’s Parade.

As his hair blew in the wind, onlookers spotted was more than a little grey.

He appeared unworried that middle-aged men who take up jogging risk destroying their hip and knee joints and placing a tremendous strain on their heart and lungs.

The PM was thought to have given up running after suffering from knee pain, but is understood to have received treatment over the summer.

Aging: Mr Cameron has in recent weeks admitted to needing glasses and complained of a 'phenomenally bad back'

In August he also revealed he was suffering from a ‘phenomenally bad back’.

The pain forced him to abandon plans to go deerstalking while on holiday on the Scottish island of Jura.

A scan showed that he had a ‘protruding disc’ and recived treatment from Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre.

Mr Cameron revealed a doctor had told him his back was otherwise in ‘good nick’.

Last week the Prime Minister had to bow to a combination of growing old and the pressures of his job and also admit he now needs glasses.

The new rimless specs, bought for £15 from Boots three months ago, were given their debut during an appearance in front of a committee of MPs, and immediately drew comparisons with Tony Blair
