Derek Thompson, 69, broke 22 ribs when he was attacked by an 800kg bull on his farm in North Yorkshire

A farmer who suffered 22 broken ribs after being trampled by a bull is on the mend - after being put back together with ‘Meccano’ surgery.

Derek Thompson, 69, spent three months fighting for life in intensive care after being hit by the animal while rounding up his cattle earlier this year.

Surgeons attached a number of titanium plates - similar to those in the construction toy Meccano - to his broken ribs to speed up the healing process, relieve pain and reduce the risk of complications.

The intricate procedure was the first of its kind performed by surgeons at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

Mr Thompson, from Northallerton, in North Yorkshire, said: 'I would think I was one of the most difficult cases they have ever had to save.

'Nearly all my ribs were broken, there was not much left. They are now held in place with plates that look like bits of Meccano.

'They are doing a marvelous job, there’s no doubt about that.'

Mr Thompson was inside a pen, picking out bulls to take to the market, when an 800kg bull charged him.

'I had my back to one of them when he decided to hit me. He knocked me over and hit me again,' said the father-of-two and grandfather-of-four.

'My son knocked him off me and I walked up to the farmhouse and rang my wife.'

He was taken to the local Friarage Hospital before being transferred to Middlesbrough and was in a coma until cardiothoracic surgeon Joel Dunning and orthopaedic surgeon James McVie operated on him.

Until recently, the only treatment for rib fractures was to strap them up and take painkillers while they healed naturally - a process which can take months.

They cannot be immobilised with splints in the same way as other broken bones are, as the ribcage needs to be able to expand and contract for a patient to breathe.

But the pain - which can make taking deep breaths and coughing excruciating - can lead to complications such as pneumonia, because phlegm can build up in the lungs and become infected.

Mr Thompson had surgery to attach curved titanium plates to each of his broken ribs (pictured). The surgery speeds up healing, relieves pain and reduces the risk of complications, such as pneumonia

Rib plating was first attempted in the 1970s and 1980s using metal plates and screws designed for other bones, such as forearms, but they were not flexible enough.

Newer techniques, such as the Synthes MatrixRIB system, developed in Switzerland five years ago, use curved plates sculpted to fit the contours of a ribcage.

Cuts are made to expose the affected ribs, which are repaired by attaching the plates with screws or wires.

The operation typically takes around two hours and patients can be home within days depending on their condition and other injuries.

Fractures then usually heal within six to eight weeks.

The procedure, which costs around £6,000 to the NHS, was approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in 2010.

Cardiothoracic surgeon Mr Dunning said: 'We now offer rib plating for major fractures and are one of only eight centres nationally doing this.

'This procedure will be a major help to our most critically injured patients and as a major regional trauma centre we estimate that this will help a lot of patients from the whole region, increasing survival rates and reducing their days on the intensive care unit.'

Mr McVie added: 'I’m really pleased that Mr Thompson is recovering well from his major chest injury and surgery. It’s great that we can now offer this surgery here at James Cook as it will help future trauma patients.'

In a study, fewer patients who had the surgery developed pneumonia than those whose ribs were left to heal naturally, and those who did not have the operation stayed an average of 10 days longer in intensive care.

Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed.

This could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such as breathing difficulties, pneumonia and chest deformity.

The new technique, Synthes Rib Matrix, sees patients undergo a two hour operation which is available both on the NHS and privately.

During the surgery, tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain.

Each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs.

The recovery time from the operation is only a few days.

The plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient's life.
