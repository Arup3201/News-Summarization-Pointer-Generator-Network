A holidaymaker escaped with just a few scratches after his car smashed through a barrier on a hairpin bend and plunged almost 200ft down a mountain.

James Swann, who was later found to be three times over the legal drink-drive limit, walked away virtually unharmed from the wreckage of his rented Opel Corsa which was severely damaged after it plunged down the Tramuntana mountain range near Andratx in south-west Majorca.

The car hit several rocks on the mountain as it careered through the crash barrier and plunged off the cliff edge, before coming to a stop between a boulder and a tree trunk.

James Swann was able to walk away virtually unscathed after the hire car he was driving crashed through a barrier and plunged almost 200ft down a mountain in Majorca, hitting rocks and trees as it fell

The rented Vauxhall Opal car was left buckled and damaged by the crash and had to be written off

Officials said it appeared Mr Swann had lost control of the car on the hairpin bend as he drove through the picturesque mountain range. They said he had had a 'very lucky escape.'

Mr Swann had to be convinced by police and paramedics who were called to the the scene to go to hospital for a check up following the accident.

He was eventually taken by ambulance to the island's Son Espases Hospital after complaining of pain in one of his shoulders.

While at the hospital he had a breath test and failed, and was found to be three times over the legal drink-drive limit.  

Mr Swann had been driving along a hairpin bend when he appeared to lose control of the Vauxhall Opal 

The incident took place at around midday on Tuesday. 

A Civil Guard source said: 'He had a very lucky escape.

'The accident is still being investigated but it appears he lost control of his vehicle on a bend and smashed through a barrier wall before going over the edge.

The car has been written off following the accident, which left the front and rear badly damaged 

The crumpled front section of the car shows that part of it fell off as it hit rocks and trees during the fall 

The inside of the car, beneath the smashed windscreen, show both airbags inflated following the crash 

'He plunged around 180 feet down the side of the cliff.

'His car was a complete write-off. The fact he failed a breath test would appear to indicate excess alcohol played a part in this accident.'

It is not known where in the UK Mr Swann is from.

Investigations are continuing into the cause of the crash after Mr Swann was found three times over the limit 

The road where the accident happened runs the length of the Tramuntana mountain range from Pollensa to Andratx and boasts some of the island's best coastal views.

It is regarded as one of the island's best cycling routes.

The mountain range, which runs from the south-west to the north-east of Majorca, was given UNESCO World Heritage Status in June 2011.
