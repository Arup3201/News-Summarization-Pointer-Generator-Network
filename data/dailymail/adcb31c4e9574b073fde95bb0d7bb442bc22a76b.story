A young woman was beaten unconscious by two men who attacked her after taunting her for being a lesbian, 

Kerry Byrnes, 23, claims was struck repeatedly on the head after being taunted about being gay in the attack near her home in Oakham, Leicestershire last Sunday.

Just moments before the two young men attacked her, they claimed they recognised her from her job in Tesco, and knew she was homosexual. 

Attack: Kerry Byrnes told how she was jumped by two men on her way home from a night out in Oakham, Leciestershire. She is pictured left just after the attack, and right beforehand

Miss Byrnes said: 'I just want these lads to be caught before they do this - or something worse - to someone else.'

She was walking home alone at 1.30am on Sunday July 17 when the two men - both white and in their 20s - started following her.

They began taunting her, saying they knew that she worked in Tesco and was a lesbian before punching her in the head.

Miss Byrnes is afraid to leave the house after the attack, and is desperate for witnesses to come forward and help bring her attackers to justice.

She said: 'We'd gone out for the evening I was just walking home like I always do.

Alone: Miss Byrnes was only a few minutes away from her house when she was attacked at 1.30am last month

Appeal: Miss Byrnes has spoken on how she was her attackers to be found. She is pictured above more recently after she has begun to recover

'I turned around and saw two lads walking behind me but I really didin't think anything of it.

'But then I heard one of them say: "That's the one that works on Fruit and Veg in Tesco, that's the lesbian".

'And then the punch came out of nowhere and I hit the floor. They just started hitting me in the head and I lost consciousness.

'I don't know how long I was out for, it must have been about 15 minutes. It's all a bit of a blur, so I don't remember very much about it.

'I know I went home and my housemate looked at me called the police straight away. I had to go to hospital and the doctors have told me there might be a slight fracture in my cheek.

'I'm not feeling great at the moment, but my friends are with me and they are doing their best to make me feel better.'

'It was horrible and I don't know how long I was unconscious for or how I managed to get home.

'I haven't left the house since it happened - I'm too scared to go out. 

Job: Miss Byrnes says her attackers recognised her from Tesco in Oakham, pictured, where she works

'I've never suffered homophobic bullying like this. I've no idea who they are, I really get on with everyone here. 

'I was just a couple of minutes from my house and that's one of the scariest things. 

Police are now appealing for help to trace the men. PC Mark Barlow, of Rutland police, said: 'This was a nasty assault which resulted in the victim receiving hospital treatment and she has been left badly shaken up.

'If you were in Oakham on Saturday night or the early hours of Sunday morning and you saw these men, or you think you know who they are, please contact us.'

The men are white, in their 20s and approximately 5ft 7ins. One was wearing a hooded top and the other had spiky blonde hair.
