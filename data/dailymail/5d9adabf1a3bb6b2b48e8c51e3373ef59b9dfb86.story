At just 200 pages long, this thin book about Spanish artist Goya should have been a quick read.

But it took David Black more than half a century to return the copy after borrowing it from an Edinburgh library as a schoolboy in 1962.

Having missed the return date by a staggering 51 years, the now 60-year-old could have been charged almost £3,000 in late fees, but bosses at the Fine Art Library waived the fine as part of an amnesty on overdue books.

Lapsed library user: David Black with the copy of Goya he borrowed from Edinburgh's Fine Art Library more than half a century ago

The copy of Dr Xavier de Salas' profile of the 18th century artist was overdue by 18,417 days when arts writer Mr Black sheepishly brought it back to the library, after spotting a notice about the week-long amnesty.

Under Edinburgh City Council's late fee charge of 15 pence per day, Mr Black's fine would have amounted to £2762.55.

Mr Black borrowed the book using a ticket belonging to his mother Winnie when he was 12

'When I read about the fines amnesty I 
decided that I must do it, once and for all, if only to see the 
librarian's face,' said Mr Black.

'It feels good to have finally returned it after all 
these years.'

Mr Black borrowed the book using his mother and former town councillor Winnie Black's ticket.

'I was only a schoolboy at the time and completely forgot to return it,' he said.

'It would pop up every now and again over the years but each time it would slip my mind to actually do it.

'Two years ago I even attended a 
showing of the play Underneath the Lintel which is about a librarian who
sets out to find whoever anonymously returned a library book that is 
113 years overdue,' Mr Black said.

The amnesty has seen over 4,000 overdue books returned to Edinburgh libraries.

'I've been a keen library user all my life, they are a great resource,' said Mr Black.

'As
a boy I drew great inspiration from this book which features a host of 
Goya's illustrations; although I never intended to keep it for so long. 
I'm glad they finally have their book back - I can now sleep a little 
more soundly at night.'

At last: Library bosses waived the late fees on the book - which would have amounted to almost £3,000

Councillor Richard Lewis, Edinburgh's culture and sport convener, said: 'This is a wonderful story and, of course, the Fine Art Library are very happy to have their book back after 50 years.'

Despite the lengthy delay, the copy of Goya is not the most overdue  book to be returned to a library.

In December 2011 a copy of the Victorian miscellany Good Words for 1888 was returned to a library in Cumbria after 123 years.
