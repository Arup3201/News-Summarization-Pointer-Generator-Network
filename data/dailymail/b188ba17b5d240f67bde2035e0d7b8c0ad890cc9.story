A cyclist has shared footage of the startling moment he was hit by a deer - with both miraculously living to tell the tale. 

Silas Patlove, 40, was cycling downhill near Sausalito, California on Sunday and cruising at around 28mph when the deer suddenly emerged from bushes and pounced into his path.

On a collision caught on Patlove's head-mounted camera, the cyclist smacked into the animal and tumbled to the ground as the shocked animal wriggled free and jumped away.

The footage, which was taken near the Golden Gate Bridge, finishes with Patlove with his head to the ground, groaning, as the sounds of a car can be heard nearby.

Watch out! Cyclist Silas Patlove was riding near Sausalito, California on Sunday when this deer pounced into his path - in a collision that was caught on his head-mounted camera

Crash: Patlove, 40, said he was cycling down the hill at around 28mph when the deer jumped out

He shared the footage to YouTube on Monday and it has been viewed more than 800,000 times.

Beneath the video, he explained that he was a bit sore and credited his helmet for saving his life.

'Although I don't remember it, I landed on my back, and hit the back of my Giro helmet, which probably saved me from serious brain injury,' he wrote.

'Although I had a mild concussion with a bit of memory loss around the event, I am very grateful to have escaped feeling only a little banged up. I cannot speak to the deer's injuries.'

He also thanked the people who rushed to help him.

Doe! The camera captured the moment his bike struck the deer, which apparently escaped unharmed

Thrown: The footage, which he shared to YouTube, shows Patlove and his bike tumbling to the ground

Knocked out: He can be heard groaning as he lies on the ground. He explained alongside the video that he suffered a concussion and some memory loss, and believes his helmet saved him from worse damage

YouTube viewers passed on their good wishes to Patlove.

'I nearly jumped out of of my chair,' one wrote. 'Hope that you're back on the road soon!' 

It's not the first time deer have been seen along that spot, as commuters reported two deer bounding through traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge in September. 

The deer briefly halted the evening commute as drivers slowed to give them space - and made sure to capture the bizarre sight on camera.
