Third class rail travel could return to Britain as the government faced claims it was turning the clock back half a century.

Plans to re-privatise the East Coast main line from London to Aberdeen include proposals for three different classes of travel.

Unions warned the return to a controversial ticketing system, not seen since it was ditched by British Rail in June 1956, raised the prospect of cut-price budget service seen on airlines like Ryanair.

Back to basics: The idea of a third class of train travel would mark a return to a system not seen for 50 years

Unions also accused the government of trying to ‘bulldoze through’ the re-privatisation of the East Coast line which has been in state hands for four years.

The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said it had seen a copy of the prospectus for returning the East Coast Mainline to a private operator by early 2015.

The Department for Transport has been considering recreating a third class of rail travel for at least a year.

Ministers have suggested it could be an additional class of travel between the existing first and standard classes – broadly equivalent to a 'premium economy' class on airlines.

It comes just days after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin suggested the government could strip out first class carriages from busy routes to make more room for standard ticket holders.

On track: The East Coast line has been in state hands since 2009, but ministers want it returned to the private sector by 2015

Open-topped: It was only in 1844 that the law was passed to ensure third-class carriages were covered. This drawing appeared in a newspaper in 1847

Third
 class travel first became an option in 1838. Six years later an act of 
parliament forced train companies to provide a roof in third class.

The
 1844 Railway Act stipulated that all third-class passengers should be 
carried in covered accommodation. Railway companies also began providing
 lighting in third-class carriages. However, whereas there were several 
oil lamps in the first class carriages, third-class carriages only had 
one.

In 1844 the railways introduced Parly & Gov class for government workers.

The Pullman car, introduced in Britain in 1874, created a new level of comfort.

Midland
 Railway abolished second class travel in 1875, upgrading third class 
passengers to second class standards. Other railways followed the 
example.

Second class disappeared from fare tables until 
1956, when third class was renamed second. British Rail later renamed 
this standard class.

But RMT general secretary Bob Crow 
said: ‘This leaked document, coming on the day of union protests at 
Parliament aimed at keeping the East Coast in public ownership, is 
political dynamite which blows the lid off the lengths to which the 
Government are prepared to go to bulldoze through re-privatisation 
before the next election.

‘If
 the Government are allowed to get away with this, passengers can expect
 third class services, shoddy performance and higher fares while the 
private companies get a gold-plated, eleven year franchise that will 
enable them to launder hundreds of millions of pounds into the pockets 
of their shareholders. It stinks and it must be stopped.’

He
 said if the third-class plan went ahead it could be a 'Ryanair model 
with passengers rammed in to creaking cattle trucks with a surcharge for
 everything from your bags to using the lavatories'.

The draft prospectus gives firms bidding for the franchise to run services on the line the option of establishing an intermediate ‘class between Standard and First’.

It could mean customers who book standard tickets in advance are guaranteed a seat, while those without bookings are crushed into even less space in what would effectively be third class.

Mary Creagh, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: ‘David Cameron says we're all in this together, but if that's true then why is he going back to the 1950s and reintroducing third class?

‘East Coast passengers deserve better than this. East Coast is working well and will have returned £800 million to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year.’

Campaigners have highlighted figures announced last week which showed that East Coast paid £208 million in premium and dividend payments to the Treasury in the last financial year.

Anger: RMT union boss Bob Crow said the plan to re-privatise the East Coast line 'stinks' and should be stopped

Its turnover increased by 4.2 per cent and it carried more than 19 million passengers - up 1 per cent on the previous year.

The campaigners also point out that figures from the Office of Rail Regulation show that East Coast received the lowest public subsidy of any rail operator by some considerable margin.

In addition, those keen to keep East Coast publicly run say that the Government is rushing through this particular re-franchising so it takes place before the 2015 general election.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘The independent Brown Review into rail franchising was clear that franchising remains the best way to secure services for passengers.

‘A strong private-sector partner will not only provide certainty of ownership for the East Coast franchise but will be best placed to build on the significant investment planned for the route, delivering benefits to passengers and taxpayers for years to come.’
