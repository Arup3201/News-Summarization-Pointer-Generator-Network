Thierry Henry has announced his retirement from football following a stellar 18-year career in the game and will take up a role as a Sky Sports pundit.

The 37-year-old scored an impressive 360 goals in 792 games for Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal, Barcelona and New York Red Bulls, as well as netting 51 times in 123 caps for France.

A good proportion of those goals were truly brilliant and here, Sportsmail has narrowed it down to the top-10 Henry strikes. Enjoy...

Thierry Henry was Arsenal's leading scorer with 228 goals, 175 of those in the Premier League

10) Real Madrid 0-1 ARSENAL (Champions League round of 16, 21/02/06)

This goal is in the list as much for its importance as for the actual quality of the strike itself.

During Arsenal's run to the Champions League final in 2005-06, Henry inspired a 1-0 first-leg victory over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the last 16.

Picking the ball up in the middle of the pitch from Cesc Fabregas, Henry flicked it past the Real defenders before placing the ball expertly past Iker Casillas.

One of Arsenal's most famous victories - and it was almost single-handedly achieved by the superb solo goal from the Frenchman.

9) FRANCE 3-1 Tunisia (International friendly, 14/10/08)

Arguably the best of Henry's 51 goals for his national side.

With France trailing 1-0 at the Stade de France, Henry picked the ball up in his own half, sprinted towards the Tunisian box and then played a one-two with Yoann Gourcuff.

He then placed a majestic shot out of the reach of the goalkeeper and into the back of the net to equalise for Les Bleus.

8) BARCELONA 6-1 Atletico Madrid (La Liga, 04/10/08)

Barca may have been storming away with this match, already comfortably 5-1 up, but Henry's contribution to the scoreline was still brilliant.

Neat tiki-taka style interplay between Henry, Xavi and Bojan Krkic eventually saw the ball land in front of Henry, who then arrowed a shot into the bottom left-hand corner of the net.

Precise football, precise finish. Simply class.

7) NEW YORK RED BULLS 5-2 Chicago Fire (MLS, 27/10/13)

A New York Red Bulls counter attack saw Henry received a chipped pass, facing away from goal, 30 yards out.

The forward chested the ball, let it bounce once before unleashing an unstoppable right-foot half-volley into the top right-hand corner of the net.

Chicago Fire's goalkeeper could only watch, rooted to the spot, such was the ferocity of the shot.

6) ARSENAL 4-2 Liverpool (Premier League, 09/04/04)

Like so many of his goals, this oneinvolved a memorable dribble through the very heart of the opposition defence.

Henry, advancing from 50 yards out, headed straight past Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann and left him on his backside, before utterly dumbfounding Jamie Carragher with his dancing feet.

The trickery allowed Henry to head to the edge of the six-yard box before placing the ball into the back of the net.

5) ARSENAL 3-0 Tottenham Hotspur (Premier League, 16/11/02)

How many players can say they have run more than 80 yards with the ball before scoring in such an important Premier League match as the north London derby?

Well, Thierry Henry is one.

He left the Spurs midfield for dead, before bamboozling Stephen Carr and Ledley King and then firing a left-footed shot into the bottom corner to send the Gunners on their way to a memorable 3-0 victory.

4) West Ham United 2-2 ARSENAL (Premier League, 24/08/02)

With West Ham United 2-0 up at Upton Park, Arsenal finally decided to start playing the football they were capable of.

After some loving quick passing in the middle of the pitch, the ball was passed to Henry's feet who, although turning away from goal, flicked the ball around the defender.

He took a touch on his knee, then caught a shot on the half-volley from 22 yards which rocketed into the far corner of the net.

West Ham United were also one of the many sides who were subjected to a Thierry Henry special

3) ARSENAL 4-0 Charlton Athletic (Premier League, 02/10/04)

This is the goal many Premier League fans associate Henry with.

Cheeky, audacious and brilliant.

Henry received the ball with his back to goal on the edge of the six-yard box and, while showing great strength to hold off Charlton Athletic defender Jonathan Fortune, Henry controlled the ball and then backheel nut-megged the centre half. The ball went past the keeper and into the far corner.

An exquisite goal.

The goal was cheeky, audacious and magnificent and basically sums Henry up

2) SC Weiz 0-5 ARSENAL (Pre-season friendly, 20/0705)

In a pre-season friendly in 2005 against Austrian side SC Weiz, Philippe Senderos played a long ball forward to Henry.

The Frenchman took a touch on his knee, flicked the ball over his own head and that of the defender, before placing a lobbed shot into the left-hand corner of the net from the edge of the area.

Probably a goal most football fans will not have seen before, but certainly one to remember.

1) ARSENAL 1-0 Manchester United (Premier League, 01/10/00)

So, our top selection sees this memorable strike against Manchester United that won Arsenal the game at Highbury.

Facing away from goal, Henry took one touch to flick the ball up before unleashing a shot which looped and then dipped into the far right-hand corner for Fabian Barthez's net.

Words don't do it justice, really.

PS) NEW YORK RED BULLS 3-1 Columbus Crew (MLS, 15/09/12)

As an 11th goal, here is a corner-kick Henry scored for New York. Was it meant, was it not?

Who knows - but it was brilliant nonetheless.
