It is a run-down house with so many problems that most would consider it unsellable.

But in an unlikely twist one estate agent has celebrated its faults and described a property as ‘shabby’, ‘tatty’ and in ‘dire need of updating’.

In a 'warts and all' advert Mike Rogerson Estate Agents say the £275,000 property in Morpeth, Northumberland, requires 'blood, sweat and tears' to make it habitable and incredibly the seller has encouraged the decision.

The four-bed terrace is described as cracked, crumbling, dodgy and from a previous century but the agent believes, despite the gloomy picture it paints, this decision is sure to make it sell.

For sale: It may be shabby, tatty and in dire need of updating but an estate agent says the honest approach will help it sell

They say there has been plenty of interest in the house already.

'The property itself has a rather shabby exterior which is compounded immediately upon entering the property by a matching disregard to what may be generally considered habitable,' the advert says.

'And being untouched by the 21st Century, will require blood, sweat and tears to haul it anywhere back to modern tastes.

Cracked: The property needs new ceilings and 'blood, sweat and tears' to make it habitable

Torn: The carpets throughout, including here on the stairs needs replacing and the seller has embraced the honest approach to the home's flaws

'Looking unremarkable from the outside, it deserves further investigation from the monumental masonry cracks as soon as you open the door, to the crumbling handrail and dodgy stone steps leading to the garage and small garden.

'A cavernous basement houses a newish combi boiler and water meter.

'The north-facing windows have been paint stuck for years, including one over the archway which is open to the elements.'

Stephanie Burn, who is selling the house, said she had been inspired by a London estate agent, Roy Brooks, who was famed for his candid housing brochures in the 1970s.

'You knew when you were going into that house that it was going to be a project,' the 73-year-old said.

'It’s all about honesty, really. That’s what people want.'

Estate agent Mike Rogerson said: 'The vendor was quite insistent that she wanted it to be warts and all.

'She had been disappointed by properties that she had visited in the past and  she realised the property has some problems but has a fantastic characterful identity underneath for someone with a bit of imagination to turn it into a  family home.

'We have been amazed by the feedback from people. Most people have said things like, how refreshing, and by the way we’d love to come and see it’.

'It was a bit of fun and a bit sarcastic but if vendors want it done in this way we’re more than happy to do it.”

Louise Wilkinson, the manager of the Morpeth branch, said the advert had been  well received and had generated lots of interest.

'We’ve had phone calls from all over with people asking us if we were aware that it was live on our system,' she said.

'But it was written purposely in this way and there is an offer on the property.

'It was a suggestion from the vendor that it was written in this manner.

'She was inspired by the estate agent from the 1960s that used to detail properties in this manner and she had done a lot of research into this.'
