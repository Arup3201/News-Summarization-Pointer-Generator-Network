Tom Watson is a keen hunter and was on a pheasant shoot near his Kansas home last year when his phone rang with ‘the call I’ve been waiting for since 1993’ offering him the captaincy again. 

In common with numerous American golfers, his vice-captain Steve Stricker is also a great hunting enthusiast.

G-Mac's nappy days

Graeme McDowell’s daughter Vale Esme is a month old tomorrow and he claims to have recovered from the mix of adrenalin and exhaustion that followed the birth. 

‘The nappy effect didn’t work so well in Denver,’ he said of his last event. ‘But now I’ve come to terms with the fact that sleeping is gone for ever.’

Yanks spellbound

The Americans had every right to be peeved at two of their rookies having their names misspelt on their allotted spots on the driving range. 

Jordan Spieth became ‘Speith’ while, even worse, Jimmy Walker was re-christened ‘Jiimmy’. Probably not great for their confidence but it was cock-up rather than conspiracy.

Ping-pong king Bjorn

Table tennis is the chief recreation of Ryder Cup teams in the build-up to matches and Jamie Donaldson (right) is trying to get up to speed after taking a beating from Thomas Bjorn. 

‘I’ve never played with a golfer who is not very good at table tennis,’ he said. ‘You can play pool and some are useless, but everyone plays table tennis well.’

The Bible brothers

Opponents of the likely American pairing of Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson may find themselves up against more than just two very good players.

Their religious faith underpins the Americans’ close friendship. ‘We go to bible study together and can talk about the things we believe in,’ says Watson.

Hair-raiser Lee

Lee Westwood is so fascinated by Rickie Fowler’s ‘USA’-engraved haircut that he went up to him on the practice range and gave his shorn head a stroke.

Europe's Lee Westwood was impressed, but certainly not intimidated, by Fowler's gesture

‘It looks good,’ said Westwood. ‘I know I’ve got a big head but I don’t know if it’s big enough to fit “Europe” on it.’
