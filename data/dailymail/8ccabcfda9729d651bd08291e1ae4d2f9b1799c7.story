As millions awake tomorrow with a pounding headache, they will face an age-old dilemma: endure the pain or embark on an arduous quest to find bacon and Berocca.

But thanks to Donna Docherty - or, the Hangover Angel - some need not worry their ailing heads.

Armed with everything from Big Macs to paracetamol, the self-styled 'morning after saint' will welcome in the new year delivering care packages direct to the doorsteps of weary revellers.

Success: Ms Docherty has 30 customers a day in Kent and is looking to expand. She has spent the last week stocking up for New Year, when everything is shut. The most popular items are bacon butties and Big Macs

And although Hangover Delivery Angels is currently based in Medway, Kent, she is looking to expand.

Ms Docherty, 40, said: 'I’m like their fairy godmother, turning up at their door with their much needed hangover cures.

'All the takeaway joints in my local area know me - I’m their best customer.

'I
 take phone orders for fast food, paracetamol and hangover essentials 
from people who are too worse for wear to make it out themselves, and 
deliver it straight to their doors.

Angel: Donna Docherty, 40, charges £5 to pick up anything from McDonald's to Wagamama

'I’ve
 been preparing for New Years’ Day for weeks now - stockpiling the 
medication and bottles of fizzy drinks, and mapping which takeaways are 
open for me to collect food from.

'Most
 people would hate the thought of working on January 1, but I love it. 
My customers are never rude, they’re always so pleased to see me - it’s 
great to be the person who can spread a bit of happiness.'

She
 started the unusual business, Hangover Angels, six months ago when she 
was made redundant from her job at a supermarket this summer.

It was an instant success, with customers flocking by the day as the festive season rolls on.

Customers pay a set price of £5 for local delivery - but Ms Docherty is willing to travel further for more.

Ms
 Docherty said: 'One day in the summer, me and my friend had spent too 
many nights in the beer garden at our local and had nursed countless 
hangovers.

'I was lying there, head 
pounding, thinking: "If only McDonald’s delivered" - and it was as if a 
lightbulb switched on in my head.

'Now I don’t get chance to go out, because I have to look after everyone else the next morning.

'I usually deliver to 30 people on an average Sunday, but that’s gone up over the festive period.

'I have to stock up on all my supplies because I don’t want to upset my customers by running out.

'There aren’t any shops open on New Year’s Day, so I need to make sure I have everything my hungover customers might need.

Ms Docherty has set up a website detailing her services and allowing people to place orders

'The most popular item I’m asked to deliver is a McDonald’s sausage and egg McMuffin - it’s the most popular hangover cure.

'But bacon butties, KFC and Big Macs are close behind - as well as packets of paracetmol and fizzy drinks.

'Bring on the hangovers, I’ll be standing by the Bat phone and ready to deliver those vital hangover cures.'
