A seven-year-old girl who appeared on national television crossing the U.S. border by herself has been reunited with her mother, it has been reported.

The Honduran child - named only as Aimee - put a human face on the crisis of undocumented minors when border guards asked where her mother lived and she replied in simple Spanish: 'In the States'.

It comes after research showed the number of unaccompanied pre-teen children crossing from Mexico has more than doubled in just a year.

Plight: Seven-year-old Aimee, a Honduran girl who appeared on national television crossing the U.S. border by herself, has been reunited with her mother. She is just one of thousands of unaccompanied minors

Questioning: Border guards questioning other migrant families. The group had made a 13-day trek

Aimee was filmed by NBC's Mark Potter as part of a report on the strained resources along the 1,954-mile border.

His report showed her among a group of women and children who had made a 13-day trip from Honduras through Mexico before crossing the Rio Grande.

'Are you alone?', asked border patrol guard Raul Ortiz in Spanish. She nodded.

'Where does your mom live?', another official asked. 'In the States', she replied.

After a moment of confusion, the girl pulled a crumpled piece of paper out of her back pocket which contained her mother's address in North Carolina.

According to an e-mail sent to NBC by the federal Administration for Children and Families, Aimee was reunited with her mother on the weekend and is immunized and healthy.

Her plight gave a personal touch to the immigration crisis which is putting increased pressure on Barack Obama.

Yesterday Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner wrote to the President, urging him to change the law to speed up the deportation of le children.

He claimed the White House had sent mixed messages over a 2008 law allowing unaccompanied children from Central America to remain in the U.S. indefinitely while their court cases progress.

Campaigners are opposed to any changes in the law and the White House has never formally pressed for them.

On Tuesday, data released by the Pew Research Center revealed the number of children aged 12 and under crossing the border alone had more than doubled in a year.

Between October and the end of May, the number of unaccompanied pre-teens taken into custody at the Mexican border reached 6,675 - compared to 3,162 apprehended in the entire previous fiscal year.

Children from Honduras account for the largest percentage of the increase, followed by El Salvador and Guatemala.

The number of young, Mexican children trying to enter the country stayed roughly the same.

In total and including teenagers, 57,525 children were apprehended between the start of October and the end of June, a period of nine months.

In the 12 months before that, just 38,759 children were taken into custody.
