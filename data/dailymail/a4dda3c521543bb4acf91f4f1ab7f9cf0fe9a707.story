Referees were thrust back into the spotlight after a tackle that ‘could have finished Stephen Ireland’s career’ went unpunished - and Sunderland’s Wes Brown was sent off in a bizarre case of mistaken identity.

The FA were hoping for a controversy-free weekend in the Premier League in the wake of Martin Atkinson’s failure to spot a dangerous challenge by Burnley’s Ashley Barnes on Chelsea’s Nemanja Matic. 

Matic was sent off for retaliating but Barnes was not even booked. Yet on the day that FIFA decided to take further advice on using video technology to help officials, even more high-profile mistakes were made.

Stoke boss Mark Hughes hit out at referee Neil Swarbrick for a dire display in the Potters’ 1-0 win over Hull after Stephen Ireland needed ‘12-13 stitches’ for a leg injury caused by Hull’s Maynor Figueroa who was not even booked.

Hughes said: ‘It could’ve finished his career. Why the ref hasn’t given a straight red I’ve no idea. It’s shocking.’ 

Roger East came under scrutiny in Manchester United’s 2-0 win over Sunderland for wrongly sending off Brown instead of John O’Shea.
