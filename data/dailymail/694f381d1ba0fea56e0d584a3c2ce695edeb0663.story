UEFA says it will add steroid profiling of players to its anti-doping program next season.

European football's governing body's medical committee has approved urine analysis in addition to existing blood monitoring for its biological passport program.

UEFA says each player tested in its club and national team competitions has a biological passport which 'indirectly reveals the effects of doping as a result, as well as providing intelligence for target testing.'

Urine analysis will be used in addition to existing blood monitoring for UEFA's biological passport program

In 2013, UEFA approved retrospectively analyzing urine samples from 900 players to decide if steroid profiling was required. Re-testing was anonymous and positive samples would not provoke anti-doping cases.

The results of that study have not been revealed.

Though top-level soccer has few doping cases, UEFA suspended three Russian players from CSKA Moscow in the 2009-10 season for doping violations.
