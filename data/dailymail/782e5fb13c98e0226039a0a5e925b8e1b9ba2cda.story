Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka declared that his players deserve to be in the Premier League after a surprise victory against Norwich moved them top of the Championship.

Alex Tettey’s early own goal handed the Carrow Road visitors a slim victory and threw the title race wide open with just two points separating the top four after last night’s match.

They could be overtaken on Saturday when Bournemouth, who relinquished first place, play their game in hand against Sheffield Wednesday and Watford, the fourth team with a strong chance, host Birmingham this afternoon.

But Karanka insisted: ‘This last week for us has been amazing. We have won three games in six days, especially against Norwich when everyone thought they would beat us. ‘I’m proud of my players. Once again they showed when they play their best they can beat everyone. I told them after the game if there is a team who deserve to be in Premier League it’s them.

‘The last game on May 2 we’ll see which team will get promotion but I think it’ ll go to the last second.’ Tettey’s mistake could prove costly in one of the most exciting end-of-season run-ins after it ended a run of eight games unbeaten for his side.

Karanka admitted before the match that if his side lost they would have been cut too far adrift from the front runners, but all remains to play for now.

The strong away contingent had settled easily in Norwich’s Riverside entertainment park ahead of kick-off and their team comfortably matched them on the pitch, in unfamiliar surroundings away from their Riverside Stadium, in the opening exchanges.

Twenty minutes after the game had started and the home side had barely got out of their own half while Middlesbrough carved out chance after chance.

One of those, in the ninth minute, produced the opener. Middlesbrough had lost back-to-back away matches - against promotion rivals Bournemouth and Watford - for the first time this season before the match, so their lead was a surprise. So, too, was the look on Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy’s face when Adam Clayton sent in a corner from the left and his own midfielder Tettey headed the ball at the near post over him and into the far right of goal. 

It had been coming. Four minutes in and full-back Tomas Kalas burst on the overlap down the right to cross for Jelle Vossen whose header was deflected wide. Two minutes later Albert Adomah, again on their right flank, feinted a cross and turned back on himself before playing the ball to Patrick Bamford. His flick-on found Vossen again and his half-volley arrowed towards the top right corner but went just over. 

‘The first 15 minutes cost us the game,’ Norwich manager Alex Neil admitted. ‘After that, we didn’t do enough to win the game. At this stage of the season it is about making a difference and we didn’t do that.

‘In terms of effort and endeavour I couldn't question them – they gave everything they had. It looks more likely that we are going to be involved in the play-offs so what we need to do now is dust ourselves off.’

Tempers flared in the dying embers of the match as both sets of players got to grips with one another

Middlesbrough continued to dominate but with Norwich’s first chance of the game on 20 minutes they really should have been level. The foray forward saw Bradley Johnson head a ball into the box back across goal and Jonny Howson had a free header six yards out but failed to find the target. 

It was, however, the catalyst for the home side to get a foothold in the game and their pressure mounted from then on until the final whistle went after seven minutes of stoppage time.

A fierce intensity gripped proceedings with the home side unable to capitalise on their growing possession. 

The sold-out stadium roared their team on and they even threw Ruddy up at the end for a series of corners. It peaked in the final few moments when, from one of those corners, Middlesbrough defender Ben Gibson threw himself in front of Russell Martin’s volley to prevent what would have been a certain goal. That block could be worth millions.
