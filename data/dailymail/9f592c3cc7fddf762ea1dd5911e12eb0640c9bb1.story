Mitt Romney had some harsh words for President Obama earlier today, criticizing him over what he believes to be the lack of a coherent strategy to combat the terrorist group ISIS.

The former presidential candidate appeared on Fox News Sunday, where he said President Obama was, 'too busy on the golf course to pick up the phone and meet with the leaders around the world and to say what happens if.'

Romney was referring to the President's decision to hit the links just hours after he addressed the nation regarding the beheading of American journalist James Foley by members of ISIS.

Running again?: A new poll that asked how Americans would have voted in 2012 knowing what they know now found that Mitt Romney had an edge over President Obama

Moderator Chris Wallace then presented the former Massachusetts governor with the results of a July Gallup poll asking Americans how they would have voted in 2012 knowing what they know now, and pointed out that Romney had an edge on Obama of 53 percent to 44 percent.

'I think they have some buyer’s remorse about President Obama,' said Romney. 

'I'm not sure how they feel about me but that’s kind of irrelevant. The real question is how’s this president doing. And frankly they recognize the president has not been engaged.'

Getting back to the President's response to ISIS, Romney said, 'You know, the Pentagon was going through what if scenarios. But the president apparently wasn't. Hasn’t developed a strategy.' 

He then added, 'I don't know whether you can’t see reality from a fairway, but the president has not seen the reality internationally.'

And it wasn't just the President's foreign policy that Romney attacked, also citing growing unemployment numbers as one of Obama's many domestic policies that aren't working in his opinion.

'We’ve got what, 92 million people that have stopped looking for work that are out of work in this country? It’s unacceptable,' he said. 

'The American people are struggling, having a hard time. This president’s policies both at home and abroad are hurting people and people are responding in the way they review him.'

Despite his feelings however, Romney said he has no plans to run in 2016.

'I'm not running and not planning on running.'
