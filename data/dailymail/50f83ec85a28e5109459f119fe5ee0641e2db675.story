NBC would have offered The Daily Show's Jon Stewart 'virtually anything' to step into the role of Meet the Press host, believing that he could liven up the Sunday morning political format.

Just one month after Chuck Todd took the anchor chair for the weekly news program, reports have surfaced that the network had in fact been desperate for Stewart to front the show.

But whatever money or deal was put on the table, comedian and media critic Stewart has resisted NBC's advances and remains at his post on Comedy Central.

New York magazine claimed that before choosing Todd, NBC News president Deborah Turness held negotiations with Stewart. The magazine said this information was according to three senior television sources with knowledge of the talks.

One source explained that NBC was prepared to offer Stewart virtually 'anything' to bring him over.

'They were ready to back the Brink's truck up,' the source said. A spokesperson for NBC declined New York magazine's request for comment. 

James Dixon, Stewart's agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

But while Stewart has remained silent on the matter, Todd responded on social media with a tweet referencing the drama.

 'If it's Sunday, it's your moment of zen', he wrote.

This is not the first time NBC have tried to recruit Jon Stewart. The network courted the television host several years ago for a 10pm variety show, a slot that ultimately went to Jay Leno.
