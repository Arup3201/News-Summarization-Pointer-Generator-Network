At least nine people have been killed and more than 100 injured after an old auditorium collapsed just as a bride started giving a speech on her wedding day in China.

Shi Tsao, 27, could only watch in horror as she climbed onto a stage in Yazhuang, Panang County to address guests seconds before the roof collapsed - burying 103 of her friends and family.

Yesterday's tragedy is believed to have happened after freezing temperatures left a thick layer on snow on the building's roof, which eventually gave way under the pressure.

Collapse: The tragedy happened early yesterday afternoon just as the hall had opened to accept the guests in east China's Zhejiang Province. 103 people were left buried beneath the rubble

Wounded: The bride's new husband Yul Ch'eng had been watching on the stage with the other guests when the roof collapsed and was taken to hospital with non-serious injuries

Conditions: The tragedy is believed to have happened after freezing temperatures left a thick layer on snow on the building's roof, which eventually gave way under the pressure

Rescue workers dug throughout yesterday evening to remove the snow and rubble and pull free all those buried beneath.

The tragedy happened early yesterday afternoon just as the hall had opened to accept the guests in east China's Zhejiang Province.

The auditorium was packed with wedding decorations at the time, many of which were left crushed under the rubble.

Of the 103 people injured, 12 were said to be in a critical condition according to coordinators of the rescue operation in Panan County.

The couple and dozens of other family members were treated for shock after the tragedy, which will continue to be investigated over the weekend.

The news comes as snowstorms wreak havoc across China, causing chaos on the country's railways and network of motorways.

Last week tens of millions of people faced serious disruption as they made their way from rural areas back into cities after the week long Spring Festival.

Blizzards that swept across China closed many major motorways as snow and ice made driving conditions hazardous, while trains were slowed down to ensure transport safety.
