Sam Allardyce will be a contender for the Sunderland manager's job if Gus Poyet is sacked.

Poyet is under mounting pressure at the Stadium of Light after an alarming slide down the table, culminating in Saturday's dreadful loss against Aston Villa which sparked a supporter revolt.

The growing animosity from fans towards the Uruguayan has not gone unnoticed by the Black Cats' board.

The club's hierarchy want to show loyalty to Poyet after the manager's excellent work in keeping the Wearsiders up last season.

But there is a fear that the growing swell of opinion opposed to Poyet's regime from fans will have an adverse impact on matters on the pitch.

And West Ham manager Allardyce, who used to play for Sunderland, will be high on owner Ellis Short's wanted list if he decides to make a change.

Allardyce has admirers at Sunderland after helping the Hammers consolidate their position in the Premier League.

Likewise, he was a strong contender to replace Martin O'Neill in the Sunderland hotseat in 2013 before Paolo Di Canio was handed the role.

Allardyce himself looks set to be out of a job when his contract at Upton Park expires this summer, with the club still to offer him an extension.

And a vacancy at the Stadium of Light could provide Allardyce with an instant route back into management if he leaves.
