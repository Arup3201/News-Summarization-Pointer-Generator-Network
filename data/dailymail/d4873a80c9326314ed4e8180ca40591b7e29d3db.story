Turning the semi-derelict medieval farm into a charming rural home has gobbled up her £600,000 life savings and a decade of her time.

But widow Lorna Sowrey has now been told she will have to tear it down...because she should be sharing it with turkeys.

The 500-year-old building in a remote hamlet on north Dartmoor is a very rare example of a Devon longhouse with a partially uncovered ‘shippon’ - an indoor area for livestock.

Defeat: Lorna Sowrey's renovations to her home in Devon could be gobbled up if she refuses to keep turkeys

Disputed area: Mrs Sowrey in the farm's medieval 'shippon', which always had an agricultural use

The arrangement was common  in the medieval period, when humans and animals lived together under the same roof.

Dartmoor National Park Authority insists that half the shippon should have been kept for ‘agricultural use’ to preserve Middle Venton Farm’s ‘cultural significance’.

Dispute: Mrs Sowrey is up against national park laws

Mrs Sowrey, 77, told the Mail: ‘I asked what I could do with the shippon if it was agricultural. I was told I could keep a cart-horse or turkeys – but they would be 6ft from my dining table.

‘It’s ridiculous, they want me to create a museum that no one will ever visit. My house is not open to the public, and I don’t want to start turkey farming at my age.’

Yesterday the authority refused her application for retrospective planning permission for the restorations. Having spent £100,000 on the shippon alone, she now faces having to spend even more undoing her hard work.

If the authority has its way, half the dining area could be carpeted, but the rest of the room would have an earth floor and an unglazed window.

Planning officers said the survival of half the shippon before the work was a ‘crucial feature’ when it was awarded a Grade II*-listing in 1988 – meaning it is a ‘particularly important building of more than special interest’, the next category down from a Grade I-listing.

Mrs Sowrey bought the cottage in Drewsteignton, near Exeter, in 2003 for £400,000 with her husband John, a retired RAF Air Commodore and an ace fighter pilot in the Second World War.

They were granted planning permission in 2009 after submitting an application which retained the agricultural character of the shippon.

Before he died aged 90 in 2010, Mr Sowrey asked her to finish the restoration as his last wish.

Preservation: Mrs Sowrey's home in the Dartmoor National Park pictured the way it used to look...

... and how it looks now after she spent £600,000 converting it. Her retrospective planning application failed

When the couple bought the house, part of the shippon had rush matting over an earth floor. Mrs Sowrey then laid concrete over the 15ft by 18ft area, which she uses as a storage space. But the authority says this amounts to it being used for domestic purposes and diminishes its ‘historic interest’.

Last night a spokesman said unauthorised works without the prior grant of Listed Building Consent is a criminal offence under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.

A future meeting will consider whether remedial action must take place and if so, what specific works and over what time scale.

Planning consultant John Milverton said: ‘I’ve never seen such a bizarre situation. To try to turn the clock back like this makes no sense whatsoever.’

Orders: Planning authorities say parts of the home including this one should be dug up again and changed

Rare: There are five or six unconverted shippons on Dartmoor and fewer than 20 converted ones
