Police in charge of keeping the Olympics safe have lost the keys to Wembley Stadium.

Scotland Yard admitted last night that it was to blame for the shocking breach.

Search teams spent days desperately hunting for the keys after they were mislaid during the final preparations for the Games.

The announcement of the lost keys came hours after Great Britain beat the UAE in a match at Wembley in the group stages of the competition

Sources said it would cost up to £40,000 to replace the hi-tech laser keys. The latest fiasco threatened to further damage already fragile confidence in security arrangements for the Games.

It also provoked a furious behind-the-scenes row between the police, Locog and private security firm G4S over who was responsible.

But late last night, Scotland Yard admitted a team of officers mislaid the ‘internal security keys’ during last minute checks.

Claims that a set of keys were lost at the Wimbledon Championships in similar circumstances were flatly denied by tennis bosses and G4S.

It is the latest blow to Olympic security after serious questions were raised about the £284million Government contract with G4S to secure the Games. Military personnel were drafted in after the firm admitted it could not supply enough guards.

More than £600million has been spent securing Games venues, using more than 13,000 police officers from across Britain.

The Met said staff discovered the Wembley Stadium keys had been lost last Tuesday as final preparations were made for Olympic football matches at the venue.

It originally said officers were ‘alerted’  to the loss at lunchtime, sparking a criminal inquiry over fears they were stolen.

But a spokesman later admitted the keys had been mislaid earlier that day by a police team who had returned to check the venue several weeks after it had been secured and sealed by colleagues.

The officers then spent several days at Wembley Stadium retracing their steps and trying to find the missing set of keys.

One source said: ‘These were hi-tech laser keys which cost anything up to £40,000 a set as they cannot be copied. They are the same as you get at prisons.’

A Met spokesman said: ‘On July 24, officers from the Olympic policing operation at Wembley Stadium reported that internal security keys which had been used by them as part of a search were missing.

‘Officers attended the venue to assist in the search for the missing items but nothing was found.

‘Detectives also went to ascertain if there was any evidence of criminal offences, however at that time there were none.’

A spokesman for Games organisers Locog said: ‘These were internal keys, locks have been changed and the security of the venue has not been compromised in any way.’

A spokesman for G4S said: ‘We have no record of losing any keys.’

A G4S guard was last night facing the sack after he allegedly spat at a soldier drafted in to provide security at the Olympics archery at Lord’s cricket ground. A spokesman said the firm was ‘urgently investigating’ the claims.
