Arrested: Matthew de Grood is facing murder charges over the stabbing

The son of a Calgary city police officer has been charged with murder after five students were stabbed to death at a house party to celebrate the end of term on Tuesday.

Matthew Douglas de Grood, whose father has been in the Canadian police for more than 30 years, is accused of using a kitchen knife to kill the victims. 

Joshua Hunter, Jordan Segura, Lawrence Hong, Kaitlin Perras, and Zackariah Rathwell, who were all students in their 20s, were killed.

The attack has been described by the police chief as 'the worst mass murder in Calgary's history'.

The 22-year-old law and psychology student had been invited to the all-day party and turned up after finishing his shift at a nearby grocery store.

Police chief Rick Hanson said de Grood 'targeted the victims one by one, stabbing them several times' at about 1am.

Three of the victims died at the scene and a fourth man and Miss Perras died in hospital.

All of them had been at the party, which was being held in a rental property near the campus.

De Grood was arrested about 40 minutes after police were called and had to be treated for dog bites after a K9 unit was used to track the suspect.

Chief Hanson said a motive for the 
attack wasn't clear and it did not appear as if de Grood had been under 
the influence of drink or drugs at the time.

He
 added that the murder suspect's father, Inspector Doug de Grood who has
 served with Calgary police for 33 years, is heartbroken by the attack.

'They are now feeling so much sorrow. Those young people are dead and they are absolutely devastated,' he said.

Neither the suspected killer or the victims, nearly all of whom studied at University of Calgary, had been in trouble with the police previously.

The party was not rowdy, neighbors said, adding that students had gathered around a fire pit to talk about politics and the stock market.

Police Chief Hanson said the attack did not appear to have been provoked by any of the 20 students who were at the party. 'They were all good kids,' he added.

They had just been celebrating the release of their band's EP on Saturday. In a post on his Facebook page, Mr Hunter had written: 'That was hands down one of the best nights of my life.'

Their band, Zackariah & The Prophets, paid tribute to the pair on their Facebook page, saying: 'We didn't lose two band mates, we lost two brothers.

'Their shining shenanigans and shining light will always be with us.'

The post added: 'ZATP is done, because the band was all four of us. Without all four of us the band doesn't exist. We love you all. And we loved them more than anything in the world.'

The University of Calgary paid tribute to the victims on Tuesday, as it confirmed that the alleged killer had been one of their graduates.

'This is a very shocking and tragic day for our students and our entire university family,' University president Elizabeth Cannon said.

'Our thoughts and condolences go out to the families of those who have lost their loved ones in this unimaginable and senseless tragedy.'

Police had been called to the rental home in the residential neighborhood of Brentwood at about 1.20am on Tuesday.

'Multiple witnesses' are currently being interviewed, police said as they confirmed the attack took place at a college party.

'The party had been going for several hours and there were a few dozen people there, it would be fair to say,' police spokeswoman Emma Poole told NBC News.

'We believe it was a college party because it was the last day of classes and the University of Calgary is just blocks away. Lots of students live in this area.'

CTV Calgary reported that was the University of Calgary student union’s annual 'Bermuda Shorts Day' to mark the last day of classes.

Neighbors said the students who rent the house had been partying throughout the day without incident.

Doug Jones, who lives across the street from the house, says about a dozen students appeared to be having a barbecue in the backyard in the evening.

'It was like a normal gathering; it wasn’t loud, it wasn’t unruly,' he told the TV station.

'Around dusk, they moved inside, and then we didn’t really hear anything.'

'We woke up this morning to yellow tape in the back alley here. I was in shock when the reporters told us what happened.'
