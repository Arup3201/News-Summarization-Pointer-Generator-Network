My heart says it is New Zealand to win this World Cup final but in my head I have to go for Australia, although not by a wide margin.

The important thing for the event as a whole is that it has got the right final, involving the two best sides. I thought India were the one team who might just have a say but Australia were too strong —both these sides fully deserve to be here.

The reason they have both earned it is that they have played the full-on, modern brand of one-day cricket: powerful batting combined with wicket-taking bowling marshalled by two captains constantly looking to make things happen. It is the completely up-to-date version of 50-over cricket — slightly different to what was seen from certain other teams we could mention.

Everyone likes an underdog, and part of you wants to see the Kiwis win because it would be great to have a new winner. They have played exhilarating cricket and you also get the sense that their whole country is really behind them. From an England point of view, they are visiting in early summer and to welcome them as world champions would really add something to it.

But my head is ruling the heart largely due to the home advantage of Australia playing at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. To me that is a massive factor at World Cups. 

The Black Caps have played every match at home so far and I fear that it is going to be difficult to travel to a venue that is going to be quite different to where they have been playing.

The ball has swung around in New Zealand, but, with the drop-in pitch, that has not been so much the case at the MCG which, apart from anything else, is much larger than where they have been so far. On some of the grounds in New Zealand even the mishits will go for six, and that will not happen this time.

One of the more notable statistics of this tournament has been that Brendon McCullum has scored 85 per cent of his runs in boundaries,

The remarkable Kiwi captain is the most important single figure in this game. As a batsman he’s shown that he is looking to tee off virtually every time.

He has made some dashing knocks in the earlier rounds without pushing on to a really big score. If he could do that in the final it would be huge for New Zealand.

He has been my captain of the tournament. He is aggressive without doing anything for show, but he may have to be a little more conservative in his field placings in this match, and how he uses the spin of Daniel Vettori will be key. 

Apart from McCullum I like plenty of cricketers in this New Zealand side, there are lots of tough nuts who are a bit unsung, guys such as Vettori, Ross Taylor and Grant Elliot.

I do not expect them to choke, but I think Australia may be building up to a big performance. The Aussies haven’t quite played their best yet and they have been more stop-start, with a game called off and the loss to New Zealand.

That will not have too much bearing in my view, and you have got to be impressed by the firepower that runs through the team — look at those late runs from Mitchell Johnson that were so important in the semi-final, for example.

This could go either way, but home advantage should just tip it for Australia. And it should be good for the neutral.
