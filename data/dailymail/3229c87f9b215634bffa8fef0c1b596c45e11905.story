Google’s next I/O developer conference in San Francisco is set to kick off later tonight, with numerous new products and services set to be revealed.

This will likely include the latest iteration of the Android operating system, rumoured to be called ‘Lollipop’.

And Google will also be unveiling a wealth of new technologies including its previously teased 3D-mapping tablet Tango, its next range of Nexus tablets, and wearable devices.

Google's I/O 2014 developer conference kicks off today at 9am PDT (5pm BST) in California. The event is famed for its reveal of the latest Google products and services, with previous announcements including Google Glass. Talks and sessions can be watched live on Google's site

The
 current prototype is a 5-inch phone containing customised hardware and 
software designed to track the full 3D motion of the device, while 
simultaneously creating a map of the environment.

These
 sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3D measurements 
every second, updating it’s position and orientation in real-time.

It then combines that data into a single 3D model of the space around the user.

The technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person's home simply by walking around the table.

Directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else.

Project Tango could also be used by the visually-impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places.

Or, when shopping, the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on.

Google also highlights some of the gaming aspects, such as playing hide-and-seek with a virtual character.

I/O (which stands for input/output and ‘innovation in the open’) is an annual developer-focused conference run by Google that reveals insights into the tech giant’s research and development.

Previous conferences have seen significant new announcements such as Google Glass and the Nexus 7 tablet, as well as upgrades to existing services like Google Maps.

This year is expected to be no different - although there’s no place this time around for Google+ at any of the talks over two days, according to the schedule.

The event will kick off with the keynote speech at 9am PDT (5pm BST) today and can be watched live on Google’s I/O site.

It’s widely expected that Google will announce the next version of its Android operating system, 5.0, on the first day, which will follow the current method of picking the name based on sweets and desserts.

Each iteration takes the next letter in the alphabet.

Previous iterations were ‘Jelly Bean’ and ‘KitKat’, with this latest OS thought to be called ‘Lollipop’ - although rumour mills have been wrong before, with many thinking the last update would be ‘Key Lime Pie’.

Other notable talks on the first day will revolve around wearable computing.

Google has already introduced the Android Wear platform but the full launch is expected at I/O 2014, with smartwatches from a variety of manufacturers including Samsung and HTC expected to be announced.

Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson 
believes Google, alongside unveiling a new version of its Android operating 
system, will put a 'heavy focus' on extensions 
for smartwatches and smart home devices.

'We think Google will 
directly counter Apple’s recent announcements of health products (Apple 
HealthKit) and home automation (Apple HomeKit),' he said.

Anyone for lollipop? It's widely expected that Google will announce the next version of its Android operating system, 5.0, on the first day. Previous iterations were 'Jelly Bean' and 'KitKat', with this latest OS thought to be called 'Lollipop' - although rumour mills have been wrong before

Google has previously used the I/O developer conference to unveil new technologies such as Glass, pictured here worn by co-founder Sergey Brin. Google Glass recently launched in the UK and was developed by Google X - a facility devoted to technological advancements

Meanwhile, a talk on the second day reveals some other technologies to be announced: ‘A 3D tablet, an Oscar, and a little cash. Tango, Spotlight, Ara. ATAP.’

‘ATAP’ here refers to Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects lab.

The ATAP lab is behind the Tango tablet, which will be a device capable of mapping its environment in 3D.

Its goal is to use 3D scanning technology, akin to that in Microsoft’s Kinect sensor, to create 3D maps of an environment.

This means that a person’s phone or tablet, for instance, could produce highly detailed interior maps of buildings, rooms and houses.

And this could allow a device to provide directions inside a building, beyond just a street address.

Project Ara, meanwhile, is heralded as ‘the only phone you’ll ever need’.

Google's innovative Project Tango is pictured. The technology uses 3D scanning sensors, similar to Microsoft's Kinect, to create whole maps of interior locations. It can be used by a device to automatically build a 3D map of anywhere the user is, allowing for far better indoor navigation

Project Ara, pictured, is Google's much-anticipated modular smartphone that could be available in January 2015 for as little as £30 ($50). Each component of the smartphone will be upgradeable including the camera and battery, making it the 'only smartphone you'll ever need'

Each component of the jigsaw-like Ara phones will be upgradaeable, from the camera to the battery.

The so-called modular smartphone is expected to go on sale in January 2015, and could retail for as little as £30 ($50).

I/O 2014 is also expected to be where Google unveils new products in its Nexus line of tablets.

The next Nexus 10 tablet, rumoured to have a resolution of 2560 x 1600, will compete with Apple’s iPad Air and Amazon’s Fire HDX.

The smaller, HTC-built Nexus 8 tablet will also be unveiled.

The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, suggests that Google is also planning to reveal its Android TV.

This set-top box, powered by Android, will let users control their TV with any Android device such as a smartphone or tablet, or perhaps even with Google Glass.

The second generation Nexus 7 (pictured), co-developed with Asus, was made available on 26 July 2013, with the Nexus 8 thought to be following this year. Here on 24 July 2013 Hugo Barra, director of Product Management at Android, holds a new Nexus 7 tablet during a Google event

And Google is also expected to reveal an in-car system known as Auto Link - a competitor to Apple’s CarPlay.

Its exact purpose is unknown, however, with some suggesting it may just be a way to control Android devices via in-car buttons.

On the home front, Google’s Nest Labs
 - which makes network-connected thermostats and smoke detectors - 
announced earlier this week that it has created a programme that allows 
outside developers, from tiny startups to large companies such as 
Whirlpool and Mercedes-Benz, to fashion software and 'new experiences' 
for its products.

Integration
 with Mercedes-Benz, for example, might mean that a car can notify a 
Nest thermostat when it is getting close to home, so the device can have
 the home’s temperature adjusted to the driver’s liking before he or she
 arrives.

And, finally, one of the last talks at the conference could also prove to be the most interesting.

‘Robotics in a new world’ could be a look at some of the artificially-intelligent devices Google is developing, including its smart driverless cars.
