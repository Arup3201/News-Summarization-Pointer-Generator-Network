She faces months of treatment 12,000 miles from home - but that hasn't stopped little Madison Merrick from smiling.

The four-year-old was born with her bowel outside her body and has travelled from New Zealand to Britain with her mother Alana for the treatment she so desperately needs.

She has already been there more than a year and her mother has vowed that they will stay in the city of Birmingham for as long as it takes to find a bowel donor.

Little fighter: Madison Merrick, with her mother Alana, is all smiles despite enduring months of treatment for a condition which impacts on every aspect of her life

Alana said: 'A new bowel would mean she could grow up to live normally - otherwise, we’re looking at a lifetime in and out of hospitals.

'It is difficult living away from home for so long and not knowing when we will be returning to New Zealand.

'I love the city and the people here have made us both so welcome. I couldn’t have asked to come to a better place while Madison waits for her treatment.'

Madison and Alana, 22, flew to Britain from their home in Auckland in May last year because the surgery the youngster needs is not available in New Zealand.

She is being treated at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, which has an international reputation for transplant work.

Madison - who is known as Madiee - has spent the last 12 months undergoing a series of tests and has just been placed on the transplant waiting list.

But she could have to wait a year or more for an organ to become available. And she will have to stay in Birmingham for at least six months after the procedure to ensure her body does not reject it.

The $1million cost of Madison’s treatment is being met by New Zealand’s Ministry of Health, which is also funding her accommodation in Bennetts Hill, close to the hospital.

The little girl was born with gastroschisis, in which her small and large intestine sat outside her abdominal wall. She also had a hole in her small bowel.

Madison has already had a string of operations but she is unable to eat and has to be fed intravenously. This can cause liver damage over time and so a bowel transplant is her only hope in the long term.

Alana said: 'Madison is such a happy little girl. She loves dancing, dressing up and playing with her dolls and toys.

'But this operation is essential for her to grow up and live a normal life. I have the support of a couple of relatives over here and I have met some wonderful people who have become great friends.

'But I will stay here for as long as is required. Nobody knows how long it will be before the right match comes up. It is a waiting game.

'A transplant would be something worth waiting all the time in the world for.'

Alana is raising cash to help pay for living expenses as she is not eligible to work in Britain.

Her friend Joanne Franks, who made contact after following a Facebook appeal for Madison, is leading the campaign.

Joanne said: 'Madison is a lovely girl and it has been so difficult for them both to come to a new country on their own.

'I wanted to do all I could to help them settle in and raise money for Alana and Madison’s living expenses.'
