Former Rangers striker Marco Negri has revealed he quit the Scottish giants after fearing he was HIV-positive.

Negri joined the Ibrox outfit from Italian side Perugia for £3.5million in 1997, scoring a staggering 23 goals in his first 10 league games for the club.

However, a series of injuries destabilised his career in Glasgow including a reserve match against Aberdeen on November 13, 2000.

Ex-Rangers forward Marco Negri has revealed that he quit the club after fearing he had AIDS

Cosenza (Italy) - 19 goals in 34 league games - (1994-95)

Perugia (Italy) - 33 in 60 - (1995-97)

Rangers - 32 in 30 - (1997-2001)

Vicenza (Italy, on loan) - 1 in 9 - (1999-00)

Bologna (Italy) - 0 in 3 - (2001-02)

Cagliari (Italy) - 2 in 5 - (2002)

Livorno (Italy) 8 in 10 - (2002-03)

Perugia - 0 in 3 - (2004-05)

During the encounter the then 30-year-old forward was on the receiving end of a crunching tackle that caused his right shinbone to bleed profusely.

After hospital tests and treatment for what was perceived as a 'deep wound', Negri returned to action in the New Year to train with the reserve team where he suffered a shooting pain in his right knee and leg.

Further scans at Ross Hall Hospital showed an inflammation of the shinbone and more worryingly that properties of his blood had been attacked by a lymphogranuloma or lymphosarcoma - common symptoms for those that suffer with HIV/AIDS.

However, in his imminent autobiography 'Moody Blue - The Story of the Mysterious Marco', which is serialised in the Daily Record; the now 44-year-old reveals that his worst fears weren't confirmed after flying to Italy for treatment.

'I was immediately hospitalised. I hadn’t even considered the possibility of being HIV positive but the harsh reality was there in front of me in the medical report, and it was hard to ignore and digest,' Negri wrote.

'I didn’t feel able to deal with such a thing alone. I needed my family around me and wanted to undergo further tests in Italy to understand exactly what was going on, the risks and chances of recovery.

'I had to return to Italy, and not on a temporary basis. I asked my lawyer to speak to Rangers about an early dissolution of my contract.

'They had no objections to the premature ending of our relationship, which was something I really appreciated, although it also showed me how serious my condition was.

'Luckily, I didn’t have to wait long to learn I was simply suffering a stress fracture of the tibial axis of the knee. This diagnosis was given by doctors in Bologna. In Scotland they hadn’t got it right this time, even if the results of three blood tests confirmed some anomalies that couldn’t be overlooked.

'Further tests found my blood to be absolutely fine and there was no need for medication or invasive treatment. My drama had been resolved in the best way possible, and I put behind me the endless days of terror when the worst case scenario was swimming around in my head.'
