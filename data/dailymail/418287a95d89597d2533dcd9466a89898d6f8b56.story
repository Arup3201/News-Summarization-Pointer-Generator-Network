Britain is ready for a gay Prime Minister, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have claimed.

The Lib Dem and Labour leaders said social attitudes had changed dramatically in the last 20 years.

Voters would judge a potential prime minister on their ability to lead rather than their sexuality, they said.

Senior politicians from all parties were challenged over the politics of sexuality as gay marriage became law in England and Wales last night. The first ceremonies are due to take place on March 29.

Asked whether the public would accept a gay PM, Mr Clegg told GT magazine: ‘Yes and why not?

‘Being gay doesn't affect how you work, how you interact with people or how you make decisions. I'm confident that the British people would judge him or her on their ability to lead and be a good prime minister and not on who they choose to share their life with.’

Mr Clegg said he hoped in the future children would not dread coming out to their parents.

He added: ‘I would have no issues at all if one of my boys told me that he liked another boy.

‘It's not a choice, it's who you are and I would love my boys regardless of their sexuality.

‘I just hope that some day coming out to your parents is not going to be something you dread but something you will remember fondly.’

Mr Miliband said he expects there to be a gay PM in the future as social attitudes have driven a series of changes, including equal marriage, in the last 20 years.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government was attempting to fight prejudice where it remains

The Labour leader said: ‘Yes. I think the world has changed a lot.

‘If you think about the way the world has changed in the last 20 years since I was at college we've seen the repeal of Section 28, we've seen civil partnerships, the lowering of the age of consent, equal marriage and that has been driven by change in social attitudes and that is why I think absolutely it's foreseeable to have a gay prime minister.

‘The most important thing to me is that my kids are happy and I don't care whether they're gay or straight. That's what matters to me.’

To date there have been no openly gay leaders of any of the main political parties in Westminster.

Ruth Davidson, Tory leader in Scotland, is the first out female leader of a major party in the UK.

Prime Minister David Cameron said ‘sexual orientation should be neither here nor there’ as people are helped to achieve their full potential - including becoming PM.

He added that more role models - either straight or gay - were needed to encourage best behaviour in sport, adding clubs ‘must tackle problems on the terraces’.

In an open letter, Mr Cameron said he was proud to be PM of a country judged to be the ‘best place to live in Europe if you are lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans(gender)’, adding the Government was attempting to fight prejudice where it remains.

On sport, the Conservative went on: ‘We are working to break down barriers in sport, too. People should be able to excel in sport regardless of their sexuality - but we know how hard it's been.

‘We have seen the enormously positive reaction to people like Thomas Hitzlsperger and Gareth Thomas being open about their sexuality, and hopefully that will encourage others to be more open too.

‘But we need more role models, straight and gay, to encourage the best behaviour and clubs must tackle problems on the terraces.’
