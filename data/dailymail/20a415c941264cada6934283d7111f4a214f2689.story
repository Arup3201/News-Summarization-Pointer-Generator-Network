Accused: Daniel Bartelt, 19, has been charged with murdering his ex-girlfriend and attacking another woman with a knife last month

A 19-year-old man has been charged with killing his former high school girlfriend by strangling her in her bed, and attacking another woman three days earlier.

Daniel Joseph Bartelt is accused of murdering 19-year-old actress Jessie Blodgett after she returned to her Hartford, Wisconsin, home from a 'Fiddler on the Roof' cast party on July 15.

The college dropout also confessed to attacking a woman with a knife in a park on July 12, saying it was a 'spur of the moment decision', just hours after researching serial killers online. 

In court on Wednesday, Bartelt's lawyer Gary Schmaus said the teenager was mentally unfit to stand trial and needed to be 'evaluated as soon as possible', according to ABC News.

Police affidavits in the criminal complaint and probable cause documents say Bartelt denied killing Blodgett.

However Huffington Post reports Bartelt's fingerprints were found on a wad of of electrical tape underneath the floorboard of Blodgett's bedroom, leading to his arrest.

Investigators say he sneaked into Blodgett's house, tied her up and strangled her.

The teen had marks on her neck and a preliminary autopsy ruled the cause of death as 'ligature strangulation'.

Blodgett, a University of Wisconsin student, returned home from the party about 1am, and her mother found her dead in her bed later that day.

Bartelt and Blodgett dated in high school, acted together in theater productions and even recorded a duet which they posted to YouTube.

The pair recently began rekindling a friendship, but  Huffington Post reports Bartelt wanted to be more than friends.

Just three days before Blodgett's death, Bartelt attacked a woman with a knife at Richfield Historical Nature Park, according to new documents released by prosecutors.

He tackled her to the ground before the woman, who believed she was 'going to die', wrestled the knife from Bartelt, according to Fox 6 News.

The documents also revealed Bartlet asked her if he could leave - she said no.

Still holding the knife, the woman drove away in her car. She reportedly needed 15 stitches to her hand.

Police said Bartelt admitted to the attack, calling it 'a spur of the moment decision…to scare her.'

The
documents also outlined disturbing internet searches Bartelt allegedly performed on his laptop just 30 minutes before the park attack.

Fox 6 News said he searched for the body counts of famous 
killers, 'spree killing,' and the Wikipedia entries for two high-profile
strangulation cases - Columbian Louis Garavito, known for dismembering his victims, and South African Moses Sithole, who lured victims to secluded places before raping and killing them.

Bartelt’s parents allegedly told officials he had dropped out of college at UW-Stevens Point after a semester, and had returned home appearing depressed, according to Fox 6 News.

However in court this week, Bartelt's lawyer Schmaus said the crimes the teenager has been accused of don't 'make sense'.

'When you hear about Daniel's life and achievements and education and 
intelligence and all of the different positive things he's been involved
with up until now, it doesn't seem to blend or make sense,' Schmaus 
said.

Unsound mind? In court on Wednesday, Daniel Bartelt's attorney argued that the 19-year-old is mentally unfit to stand trial for allegedly killing Jessie Blodgett

Fox 6 News reports this week's court hearing was halted when Schmaus raised concerns 
about his client's competence to understand the proceedings. 

A 
competency evaluation will be performed by the Department of Health 
Services and Bartelt will again appear in court on September 4.
