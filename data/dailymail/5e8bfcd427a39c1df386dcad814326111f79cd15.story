A woman suffered serious injuries after falling between the platform and a moving train at Charing Cross station last night.

The woman, said to be in her thirties and hailing from Kent, was taken to hospital where she is being treated for her injuries, including to one of her legs.

The incident is not being treated as suspicious and the victim is in a stable condition, British Transport Police confirmed.

Tragic: The accident occurred just after 10.30pm as the Dartford-bound train left the platform

As the train began to leave the platform at Charing Cross station the woman somehow fell in the gap between it and the platform.

A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said: 'BTP officers were called to Charing Cross rail station on Saturday, 24 November, after a woman fell between a train and the platform as the service had begun to move away.

'London Ambulance Service medics also attended and the woman, aged in her thirties and from Kent, was taken to King's College Hospital with serious injuries, including to one of her legs.

'She currently remains in hospital and is described as being in a stable condition.

'The incident was reported to BTP at 10.32pm. Having spoken to witnesses and viewed CCTV, officers are currently treating the incident as non-suspicious and accidental, although enquiries will be made to establish the full circumstances.'

The train involved was the 22:26 Charing Cross to Dartford service. The tracks were handed back to Network Rail at 11.27pm.

Anyone who witnessed the incident should contact BTP on Freefone 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 626 of 24 November.
