Swansea City waited two years and four months for Roy Hodgson to pay a visit to the Liberty Stadium. He will not have left with thoughts of a new-look England.

He had eight potential recruits among the 22 starters, but they could not have offered up less of a show. It's a shame considering the form, excitement and shock value both sides have provided since this campaign started.

But there was none of that here, except perhaps for some of the latter from the stupid challenge of Wilfried Bony towards the end of the first half. 

Swansea's record signing Wilfried Bony was sent off for a second bookable offence, it was a huge blow for Garry Monk's side as the Ivorian had been playing well

It afforded him a second yellow card and turned the match in Southampton's favour, with victory sealed by Victor Wanyama's late winner.

'After the red card it changed,' said Southamton manager Ronald Koeman, who now has 10 points from five games. 

'This start is nice for the fans. As the manager, I have to keep quiet and continue doing what we are doing. There is no time to celebrate. Football changes fast.'

Garry Monk, predictably, counted the cost of Bony's dismissal. 'He was distraught with himself,' he said. 

'You make mistakes, I've done it myself. He will learn from it. He held his hands up.

'We didn't deserve to lose that game. Football can be harsh sometimes.'

For Hodgson's purposes, it was about searching out new possibilities — overdue possibilities in the mind of Monk. 

But as valid an argument as that has been in the past, only Wayne Routledge emerged from Monk's trio of candidates with any significant credit.

Nathan Dyer was hauled off after 59 minutes and Jonjo Shelvey never got going. 

For Southampton, James Ward-Prowse left on a stretcher in the second half after an innocuous challenge from Federico Fernandez. '

It is his foot but I do not think it is serious,' said Koeman.

It had all started quite promisingly for the Englishmen of Swansea, who are still waiting for the return from injury of Leon Britton, their most effective eligible player.

Within 10 minutes, Shelvey took possession in the centre and played a pass into the run of Routledge, whose low cross from the left was perfect. Dyer entered the box from the right and was inches away from connecting.

Routledge had a better chance after 28 minutes, running on to Gylfi Sigurdsson's pass and hitting the bar. 

Bony then had a header cleared off the line by Ryan Bertrand as his peculiar season continued. He scored 25 last season but is yet to get off the mark this time around. It got worse when he was red-carded six minutes before the break. 

His first booking, for running into Jose Fonte, was a touch harsh; his second was justified, a senseless tackle from behind on Maya Yoshida. Swansea had dominated but the red card let Southampton take control.

Graziano Pelle glanced a header wide with their first real chance after 65 minutes and Dusan Tadic then drew a comfortable save from Lukasz Fabianski with a free-kick.

Wanyama, on for Ward-Prowse, finally found a way through after 80 minutes, shooting hard across Fabianski.

Hodgson left before the whistle, which was probably fair enough.
