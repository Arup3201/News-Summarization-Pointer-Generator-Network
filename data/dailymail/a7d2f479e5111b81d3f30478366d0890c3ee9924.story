Reality in the illegal drug world is mimicking fiction.

Kevin Abar, assistant special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New Mexico, says distributors are selling methamphetamine tinted blue in the Four Corners region.

That trend mirrors AMC's hit drama Breaking Bad, which depicted an Albuquerque-based meth operation that cooked up the drug with a blue hue.

Abar says tinting meth blue is a way for distributors to advertise and brand their product.

He also says the blue meth being sold makes people sick. He says it has been cut with chemicals to make it blue and is not the 'pure' product portrayed on Breaking Bad.

Business Insider reports that meth doesn't actually come out blue once it's made, so dealers have been cutting the meth with chemicals to give the drug the famed appearance it has on the show.

'We are we are seeing an increase in blue meth up in the Four Corners, and into the Farmington region. It's actually being moved and pushed by various distributors,' Kevin Abar Homeland security Investigations told KOB.

He also said that even though the meth is bad, people are likely to keep coming back for more anyway.

'We're concerned that individuals may find it sexy and want to try it and utilize the drug and it's very addictive,' he said.

KOB reports that even trying meth once can make a person an addict. They spoke with Jose Plata, an addict who tried the drug once when he was 14 years old.

Since then he's been in and out of jail on various drug charges.

'I regret it and I hope people will get and understanding of how crazy this drug is. It ruins your life,' Plata said. 'All it does is end you up in a place like this jail, institutions, death.'

Not only will meth put people in jail, it can make users fatally ill--especially if its blue.

'Its truly bad,' Abar said, 'It's a bad meth that's created a lot of individuals getting sick from utilizing it.'

Business Insider says that blue meth has popped up in other regions such as Kansas City in 2010 and was sold for 50 per cent more than the colorless variety even though the drugs were equal in strength.

The blue meth has also become popular in Oklahoma City, where authorities confiscated $2.3 million worth of the drug in October.

Abar says agents also have stumbled upon red-colored meth.

Breaking Bad last year ended its popular run after five seasons.
