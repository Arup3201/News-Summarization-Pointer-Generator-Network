The transfer window has finally shut after a summer of spending and a typically manic deadline day.

Plenty of clubs will be happy with their dealings, while others will rue the ones who got away as £850million was splurged.

Here, Sportsmail charts the winners and losers from the summer window...

Spend, spend, spend: Premier League clubs splashed out more than £850m in the transfer window

Winners

Chelsea: Probably the biggest winners overall, buying well in the positions they needed to. Chelsea had a clear plan of the flow of players in and out of Stamford Bridge and struck early meaning Jose Mourinho could spend transfer deadline day relatively stress free. New additions Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas have made superb starts already.

Hull City: Steve Bruce was the standout performer on transfer deadline day. He pulled off something of a coup, bringing in Hatem Ben Arfa from Newcastle and Gaston Ramirez from Southampton on the final day, to add some flair to a solid team. Add in club record signing, Uruguayan striker Abel Hernandez, and it speaks a lot about Hull’s ambition.

Superb start: Diego Costa has already scored four goals to Chelsea following his £32m move

Man City: Like Chelsea, City did much of their business early, eliminating the danger of panic buying. It was a relatively low key window but they managed to retain the signatures of key players while bolstering an already strong squad with shrewd purchases, like tough tackling Fernando and Eliaquim Mangala, who they identified as targets early on.

Liverpool: Brendan Rodgers had a big money pot to play with from the £75m Luis Suarez transfer. He brought in nine players to bolster a squad that was sometimes short of depth last season. Mario Balotelli is a risky but potentially inspired signing. Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana are likely to be key figures.

Arsenal: There were nervous moments for fans who thought the window might pass without a striker being signed to replace the injured Olivier Giroud. The deal for Danny Welbeck went through at the death. While not a prolific goalscorer he has a great work rate and will be keen to impress at the Emirates and retain his England spot. Alexis Sanchez another good buy.

Losers

Southampton: Ronald Koeman has done a sterling job of rebuilding after the heart was ripped out of this team, with several high profile departures. The club has reinvested some of the money in Serbian Dusan Tadic and Graziano Pelle who both look bright on early inspection. There is reason to be optimistic but this squad is ultimately weaker than last season.

Man Utd: Spent plenty and two eyecatching signings but few spectators watched a dreary 0-0 against Burnley last week and thought what Louis van Gaal most needed was a top quality striker. While Radamel Falcao is a nice luxury it is a bit like laying a new floor when the roof is leaking. Weaknesses in central midfield and defence will need to be papered over.

Tottenham: This window has been by no means a disaster for Spurs, who signed the versatile Benjamin Stambouli on deadline day, but it has been slightly underwhelming. They missed out on Danny Welbeck to north London rivals Arsenal and failed to land the superb Morgan Schneiderlin from Southampton. Mauricio Pochettino will have to work with what he already has.

Newcastle United: Things started brightly on Tyneside with long-term targets Remy Cabella and Siem de Jong secured. But a lack of investment has left them short all over the pitch. The departure of talented Hatem Ben Arfa to Hull will come as a blow to fans who have been disappointed to see the playmaker marginalised by Alan Pardew.

Burnley: A limited transfer budget has meant Burnley bought in bulk but with little emphasis on quality. Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane, both bought on transfer deadline day, are both promising youngsters but unproven at the highest level, while George Boyd failed to make the grade at Hull last season.
