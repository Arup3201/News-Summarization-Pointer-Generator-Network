Filled with independent labels and one-off buys the ASOS Marketplace is already loved by fashion fans wanting to stand out from the crowd, and now the online shop is standing up to cancer too as it launches a celebrity sale for charity. 

Sharon Osbourne, Pixie Lott, Lydia Bright and Louise Roe are among the many TV, music and sports stars who have donated items from their personal closets to help raise funds for Stand Up To Cancer, the joint national fundraising campaign from Cancer Research UK and Channel 4.

From Friday 10th October fans can snap up pre-worn and pre-loved pieces from their favourite stars, including party dresses from Pixie, red carpet styles from Lydia and even a designer gown worn by Sharon Osbourne for the 2013 X Factor final, with 100% of the profits donated to the charity.
