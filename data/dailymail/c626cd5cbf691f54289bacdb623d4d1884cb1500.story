As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

BAFETIMBI GOMIS IN A NUTSHELL

It is extremely rare for a club to get a proven goalscorer on a free transfer, but that is exactly what Swansea City have achieved with the signing of Bafetimbi Gomis on a four-year deal.

The striker's contract had expired at Ligue 1 side Lyon and, despite being a long-term target of Newcastle United, Swansea took advantage of the uncertainty over his situation and brought him to South Wales.

With 12 France caps and three international goals, Gomis' talents have been utilised on the big stage and he is a big, bulky forward who also has pace.

The 29-year-old can hold the ball up, although his touch is not necessarily his strong point, and he knows where the goal is. Gomis is perfect at leading the line and is a danger particularly in the air, but also on the deck.

Bargain: Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis will cost you just £6.9million in MailOnline's Fantasy Football 

Power: Gomis is a big centre forward who can hold the ball up well, but he is also pacey in attack 

Last season Gomis scored 14 goals in 33 Ligue 1 appearances for Lyon.

That is a strike-rate of a goal every 2.35 games, which is a decent ratio for the French league. 

With only three yellow cards last season, his disciplinary record is also decent for a big forward.

The striker averages 2.4 shots per game and he wins 1.7 aerial duels a match. 

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE GOMIS IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM

Gomis is never going to set the world alight and he is unlikely to be right at the top of the goalscoring charts with season - but he is a bargain at £6.9million in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game because he will accrue points.

With 14 goals in the league for Lyon last season he has proven he can find the net. Goals are like gold-dust in Fantasy Football and so Gomis will guarantee you points. As a second or third striker option he is ideal because he will regularly gather points for your side.

His disciplinary record is also decent enough, with just three bookings last season, meaning he is unlikely to regularly lose you points due to him being red-carded or cautioned.

Gomis could end up forming a formidable partnership with fellow Swans hitman Wilfried Bony up top, meaning he should keep gathering points along the way all season. 

European quality: Gomis has scored regularly in Ligue 1 and the Champions League for Lyon

Prolific: Gomis scored 14 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games for Lyon last season - a strike every 2.35 games 

THE GAME IN WHICH GOMIS PROVED HIS WORTH 

Gomis has taken to life at the Liberty Stadium like a Swan to water, with two goals in his pre-season campaign.

His first strike came against Exeter City and it was a trademark Bafetimbi Gomis goal.

Full-back Neil Taylor lofted in a excellent ball and Gomis rose well to power a header home from close range, 

The French international also netted away to Reading with a goal that showed both his pace and class in front of goal.

He launched a run in behind the Royals defence and capitalised on a poor back pass. After racing towards goal with the ball, he put Swansea 2-0 up with a delicate chip over the advancing goalkeeper.

He has already started to adapt to life in English football, and more goals are sure to follow. 

Delicate: Gomis has scored twice in pre-season, including showing his subtler side with a chip vs Reading

Competitive: Gomis is tall and good in the air - he scored a bullet header against Exeter during pre-season 

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Swansea manager Garry Monk seems delighted to have recruited the former Saint-Etienne man.

He believes the forward's experience at the top level will make him a success in the Premier League. 

'It's a fantastic signing; a very big and important signing for the club,' said Monk.

'I'm very happy,' he said, 'You are talking about a quality striker who has played international, Champions League and top flight football in France for a big club.

'It shows just how far we have come that we can attract a player of his quality.

'He's a player that can excite the crowd, make and score goals. He's always done that wherever he's been - and that's what we want him to keep doing here.

'We want him to be an important cog in the squad and help us to continue building.'

HE'S CHEAP FOR A PROVEN GOALSCORER

At £6.9m in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game, Gomis is extremely cheap for someone proven to score  goals at the top level.

Incredibly, he is the 57th most expensive striker, yet his stats should be that of a top-20 player. 

He will not top the charts but he will give great returns as a second or third striker. You want to budget well and Gomis is a bargain who can accompany some of your more expensive forwards.

Here are just some of the strikers who Gomis is cheaper than: 

Jonathan Walters (Stoke City) - £8.3m

Fabio Borini (Liverpool) - £8.1m

Dwight Gayle (Crystal Palace) - £7.8m

Arouna Kone (Everton) - £7.6m

Ayoze Perez (Newcastle United) - £7.5m 

Cheap: There are 56 strikers who will cost you more than Gomis yet he is almost sure to get your points
