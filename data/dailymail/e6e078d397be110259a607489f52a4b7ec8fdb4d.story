A promising student at Oxford University has died in hospital from severe head injuries after he is believed to have plunged down a flight of stairs in his college.

Second-year student Conor Robinson had been studying English literature at the world-renowned Magdalen College when he was found late at night by university staff.

The 21-year-old undergraduate, who was also a talented actor with the National Youth Theatre, was rushed to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital intensive care unit.

Conor had been found injured on October 8 and had been treated by surgeons at the specialist head injuries hospital since. He lost his battle for life after his condition worsened yesterday.

Thames Valley Police are investigating the death which they do not believe to be suspicious.

A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out in the next couple of days.

The police spokesman said: 'We are investigating the death and a file will be prepared for the Oxfordshire coroner,' said the spokesman.

Conor, from County Durham, was described by Oxford University as a popular student who was very promising.

Professor David Clary, President of Magdalen College, Oxford, said today: 'It was with great sadness that we learned that Conor Robinson, a second year undergraduate at Magdalen College, died on October 15 at the John Radcliffe Hospital.

'He had been in intensive care after incurring a head injury at the college on the evening of October 8 in an accidental fall.

'Conor was from County Durham and was studying English. He was a popular and very promising student.

'The whole college is greatly saddened by this loss and extends its deepest sympathy to Conor’s family and friends at this very difficult time.'

'The College will not be making any further comment at this time.'

Today his friend Rachael McClafferty took to Twitter to express her grief saying: 'R.I.P. Conor Robinson. Only 21 years old, Always sadder when someone so young dies. Life isn’t fair.'

The Magdalen College student's body was taken to the hospital mortuary and a post mortem examination was due to be carried out

Conor and his friends, Frank Lawton and Gabriel Macculum, wrote and performed a play during his first year as an undergraduate at Magdalen College.

Entitled 'Three Guys, One Cupper' the play was based on their own experiences at Oxford from essay deadlines and being constantly distracted by friends.

Friends said at the time that he was delighted about the news of his unconditional offer to study English Literature at Magdalen College.

He told them in December 2011: 'Letter from Oxford has come. Billy Elliot moment to the max.

'OFFER FROM OXFORD! (Magdalen college, the lush one!!!)'

Conor was also a volunteer at the Paralympic games at London 2012 welcoming 6,000 athletes to the village.

He said at the time: 'Class few weeks down in London, tough at times but worth it.

'Then given free front row tickets to watch the opening ceremony! Mint summer. And next... Oxford. Bring it on!'
