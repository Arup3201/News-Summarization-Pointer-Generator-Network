Liverpool want a buy-out clause in Raheem Sterling’s next contract to apply only to overseas clubs — so they don’t lose him to a Premier League rival.

Sterling, 19, has begun talks with Liverpool over a new long-term deal, with both sides aware of his growing reputation as one of the best young players in Europe.

The youngster, who cost £1million when he signed from QPR in 2010 — which now looks a steal — wants a buy-out clause inserted in case Real Madrid or Barcelona come calling.

Liverpool accept the clause as part of negotiations and a fee of £55m would represent a staggering profit on the player anyway.

But they are keen that the figure does not apply to other Premier League clubs to ensure Sterling does not end up at Chelsea or Manchester City.

Owner John W Henry was adamant when Luis Suarez wanted to leave in 2013 that he would not be sold to a domestic rival. Arsenal’s bid was rejected but Suarez was allowed to sign for Barcelona last summer.

Sterling started in England’s Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday having been involved in controversy earlier this season when Roy Hodgson revealed he was too tired to start against Estonia.

Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre contacted Sterling’s camp about holding new contract talks last month after the player had been linked with Real.
