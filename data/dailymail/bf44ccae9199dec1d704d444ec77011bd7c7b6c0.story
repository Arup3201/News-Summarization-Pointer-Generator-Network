A Chinese lion dancer who died following a tragic accident at practice last week has been remembered as a funny, talented young man.

Tommy Jin Au Yeung passed away at the weekend from injuries suffered while rehearsing in Sydney on Tuesday.

The 19-year-old was standing on a fellow performer's shoulders at practice with the Chinese Youth League's lion dancing group at Haymarket last week and was preparing to leap to a platform when he fell heavily.

Tommy Jin Au Yeung died at the weekend from injuries sustained while at Chinese lion dancing practice last week

He hit his neck on a metal platform, known as a pole in lion dancing, and died in intensive care at St Vincent's Hospital over the weekend.

Videos of him perfecting the move that ended his life had been posted on social media throughout the year.

'After a month of hard work with my partner Jonathan, we finally performed our first poles,' he wrote.

Aside from his passion for the traditional Chinese dance, Mr Yeung was an aspiring rapper who posted his street battles and solo material online.

The death has rocked the 20-odd members of the lion dancing troupe.

Colin Lau remembered the teen as an extremely funny and light-hearted man.

'He was a very talented and promising lion dancer who unfortunately had his life cut short by a freak accident,' he wrote on Facebook.

'Please send your thoughts and prayers to him for the next life.'

Another friend remembered Mr Yeung's impressive rapping skills.

'Rest in peace Tommy, the room lit up whenever you entered and you never ceased to amaze with your rapping talent,' Jason Sheridan wrote.

'(Chinese Youth League) will never be the same without you.'

Emergency services were called to the Chines Youth League in Haymarket, Sydney last Tuesday evening

The Chinese Youth League has been a cultural institution in Sydney for 75 years and is behind the traditional lion dancing performances for Chinese New Year celebrations in the city centre.

Damien Baker, who was at the scene of the accident last week said ‘paramedics were initially called with reports of an assault but later learned that he had fallen from stilts.'

'He was dressed in the bottom half of a Chinese dragon costume. I think what probably happened was that the stilts broke, and he was impaled onto one of them on his way down.'

'It took a long time to get him out of the building. When he was taken into the ambulance, they took great measures to block him from the view of the crowd,' Mr Baker said.

There was a large crowd of bystanders, medical teams and plain clothed as well as uniformed officers on the scene.
