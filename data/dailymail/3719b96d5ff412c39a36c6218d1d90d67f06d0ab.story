Deputy head: Martin Goldberg, 46, was found dead a day after police questioned him over allegations that he had purchased child pornography from abroad

A paedophile deputy headmaster who secretly filmed his pupils may have been assessed as a ‘low risk’ by detectives, it was claimed today.

Essex Police began probing allegations that Martin Goldberg, of Thorpe Hall School in Great Wakering, had bought material online which may have included images of naked teenage boys.

Mr Goldberg, who taught at the £10,000-a-year private school, was found dead the day after they spoke to him at his £360,000 four-bedroom home in Shoeburyness, where he lived alone.

After the 46-year-old's computer was seized, officers found hundreds of indecent images.

It has since emerged that Essex Police had been alerted to the concerns about Goldberg - along with 34 other suspected paedophiles - nine months earlier, as part of Canadian police’s Operation Spade, but did not act.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, the county’s police and crime commissioner Nick Alston said: ‘I understand that Mr Goldberg was assessed as low-risk.’

He added that it was clear something had ‘gone wrong’ - but said Goldberg may not have been the force’s highest priority, as it dealt with huge amounts of information.

Mr Alston also said the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) had received the details in 2012, but had taken a year to pass it on.

He stated that the force had charged two people in connection with the Operation Spade intelligence, adding: ‘It’s not as if they were sitting doing nothing, it’s a question of priorities’.

Mr Alston added: ‘My job is to make sure Essex Police are operating as effectively as they can with the resources they have got. But this is a case where things have gone wrong.

Workplace: Mr Goldberg was employed at £10,600-a-year Thorpe Hall School in Great Wakering in Essex

‘It was nine months too long and it should have been sooner. We need to find out why, but it’s not just resources. We need, and I think we have got, good procedures for acting on the threat of harm to individuals.’

Mr Alston previously said Ceop procedures may have to be reviewed, along with Essex Police’s action. The case is being reviewed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

Officers have refused to comment further while this process is carried out. Goldberg was found dead on September 10. His death is not being treated as suspicious.

It is thought that he had taken images of children at the school and other locations using a hidden camera. These pictures are believed to date back to 2000 and feature boys aged from nine to 12.

Essex Police were originally told of concerns about Goldberg after Toronto police contacted them in November 2013 with information suggesting he had bought videos of naked boys several years ago.

A police spokesman said: ‘It is important to stress that we have found no evidence of any other offences by Mr Goldberg involving these children.

House: Goldberg tried to destroy the evidence by reportedly setting fire to his computer and other devices and paperwork - and then hanged himself in the garage of his £360,000 four-bedroom home (pictured)

‘At this time there is nothing to suggest that he made inappropriate physical contact with any child.

‘The school has co-operated with our investigation and we have also found no evidence to suggest that anyone else was involved in Mr Goldberg’s criminal activity. There is also no information that he shared any of these images or that anyone else was aware of his offending.’

Late investigation: Essex Police did nothing about 46-year-old Goldberg (pictured) until three weeks ago

Essex Police did nothing about Goldberg until three weeks ago - almost a year after being informed. Nor did officers warn the school where the IT expert regularly took children away on official trips.

The blunders were compounded when officers failed in a bid to get a search warrant from a magistrate. 

So they simply visited the paedophile’s home, just over a mile from the school, and politely asked if they could examine his computer. He refused and the officers left without arresting him.

But within hours he tried to destroy the evidence by reportedly setting fire to his computer and other devices and paperwork – and then hanged himself in the garage of his home.

Detectives were still able to recover 75 images taken on a camera that was hidden in a bag in the school’s male changing rooms.

There were 465 images from a local swimming pool and 38 from two other unknown locations.

Four boys aged between nine and 12 have been identified as featuring in the images, and their parents informed. But in many other cases, faces are not shown, or are out of focus, making it impossible to know the full tally of his victims.

The case has sparked fresh fears about potentially thousands more paedophiles being left unchecked, despite evidence against them, because UK police are taking so long to act on masses of information from child sex investigations overseas.

Another name on the list of 2,345 suspects given to British authorities by Toronto Police was cancer specialist Myles Bradbury, 41.

Astonishing: Shocked parents at the school where Goldberg taught were struggling to cope with the revelation

Last month Bradbury pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault and 12 counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, with many of the offences taking place at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.

Informed by police: Thorpe Hall’s headmaster, Andrew Hampton (pictured), said everyone at the school in Essex felt 'surprised, angry and betrayed'

He was known to the authorities in 2012 – 16 months before he was arrested for abusing ill children – but investigations were ‘shelved’ until November 2013. He is expected to be jailed when he returns to court for sentencing. 

Last night shocked parents at the school where Goldberg taught were struggling to cope with the revelation. A source close to the school told the Daily Mail it was feared that as many as 25 pupils had been covertly caught on film.

He had also masterminded his school’s computer system, issuing iPads to all pupils. His digital mastery has led to fears of what else he could have done, and concealed.

Yesterday Essex Coroners’ Office confirmed an adjourned inquest had been told that Goldberg died by hanging. There were calls for a thorough investigation into the delays in the investigation.

Local MP James Duddridge said: ‘Questions do need to be asked of Essex Police around how quickly this was dealt with.’

Police informed Thorpe Hall’s headmaster, Andrew Hampton, that his deputy had killed himself after he had been questioned about buying films of young boys.

Initially Mr Hampton planned a remembrance ceremony and paid a glowing tribute, telling a local newspaper: ‘It’s a cutting edge school and he was a cutting edge guy. He was an ideal deputy and I couldn’t have asked for better.’

Yesterday, however, Mr Hampton said in a statement: ‘Everyone at Thorpe Hall School feels surprised, angry and betrayed.’

Yesterday an Essex police spokesman said there was no evidence of physical abuse by Goldberg of any children. There had been insufficient evidence to arrest Goldberg, he added.

Yesterday, a resident in the cul-de-sac where Goldberg lived said: ‘I’ve heard he hanged himself in the garage and was burning papers in his office before then.’

Goldberg’s parents Harvey, 77, and Sheila, 72, live nearby. They were not available for comment.

Essex Police only yesterday reported itself to the IPCC for its long delay in investigating Goldberg – weeks after his death.

Last night an NSPCC spokesman said: ‘It is very concerning there appear to have been considerable delays in these cases before the police have taken action.’
