A police officer was paid £10,000 compensation after falling off a chair on London Underground premises, it was revealed today.

In total Transport for London has been forced to pay out £4.76million to people injured on tube trains, buses and train station platforms across the capital over the last three years.

Details of the award to the British Transport Police officer were released after it emerged Norfolk Police officer Kelly Jones is suing a petrol station owner for £50,000 because she allegedly tripped while responding to a 999 call.

The WPC was condemned by Phil Gormley, her force's own chief constable, when it emerged she was taking action against garage owner Steve Jones in Theftford, Norfolk.

It has also been revealed a Grampian Police officer was paid £108,000 after being hurt by a pair of handcuffs while Surrey Police officer PC Richard Seymour launched legal action against a burglary victim after allegedly falling into a drain while investigating a break-in.

Details of the payment made to the transport police officer were released following a freedom of information request made by the Liberal Democrats.

Transport for London paid out a total of £11,575 to the officer in 2012, although that final bill includes their own legal costs.

The biggest overall compensation payout made by the authority since 2010 was £158,584 given to somebody who tripped up over a pillar on a pavement.

A blind person was given £34,030 after being caught in an automatic door, £15,168 was given to somebody who had their elbow trapped in a Tube train, and a 
would-be traveller was given £10,050 after a seat on a platform collapsed.

Councillor Anood Al-Samerai, leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Southwark Council, condemned the payments and said the compensation culture has 'gone mad'.

'These are extraordinary figures which yet again show we're living in a compensation culture gone mad,' she said.

'If somebody is seriously injured and TfL is at fault then clearly there is a need for compensation to cover medical bills and time off work.

'But with so many large claims going through the system, I would question why TfL aren't saving themselves some big payouts by upgrading safety standards for travellers.

'Londoners spend a lot of money on bus and Tube fares. They want to know it's being used to invest in a modern public transport system, not going up the wall on hundreds of expensive compensation payouts.'

Among the other payments, £35,566 was given to someone who slipped on a wet platform while a traveller who tripped over a raised manhole cover was given £30,600.

Someone who slipped on a wet floor was paid £20,011 and £13,281 was paid out to someone who slipped on a wet mat when entering a station.

A person who was hit by a bus was paid £27,245 in 2011.

Jill Collis, London Underground’s Director of Health, Safety and Environment, said: 'We have an excellent and improving safety record. Out of well over a billion passenger journeys last year, 435 resulted in a compensation claim – some of which were subsequently not pursued, were rejected or closed at no cost. This equates to one claim from every 2,298,850 journeys.

'However, we are not complacent, and are continually working to further improve safety on the network – including the highest standards of staff training, a rigorous maintenance regime and a wide range of activity to remind people to take care when on the network.'
