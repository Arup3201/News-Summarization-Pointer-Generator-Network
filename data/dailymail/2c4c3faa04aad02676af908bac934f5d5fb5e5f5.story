The largest ever simulation of the universe has been run by the 26th most powerful computer in the world.

Researchers at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study in Seoul used the Tachyon II supercomputer for the task, which has 157,392GB of disk space and over 26,232 processing cores – and it still needed 20 days to complete the task.

In the end it analysed around 374 billion particles, which equates to an area around two thirds the size of the observable universe.

The purpose of the study - called Horizon Run 3 - was to run the birth and evolution of the universe to see if it ends up with the same properties as the one we see around us, including galactic clusters and super-clusters.

By studying this virtual version, astronomers are better able to predict how the universe will change over time.

They are also able to study in detail structures that are too old and distant to see with telescopes and matter that only exists in theory, such as acoustic baryon oscillations.

These are huge clumps of frozen dark energy left over from the birth of the universe.

Astronomer Dr Heather Couper believes the project is extremely worthwhile.

She told MailOnline: 'This is a mind-boggling, ambitious project. It will shed light on the past and future of our universe - and give us insights into the mysterious dark matter that makes up so much of our cosmos, and the unknown dark energy that drives it.'

It’s thanks to supercomputers such as the Tachyonii that our understanding of the universe is growing at unprecedented rates.

By comparison, a simulation of galaxies in 1970 by Jim Peebles at Princeton University analysed just 300 ‘particles’, while in 2005 the Millennium simulation looked at 10 billion particles.

As MIT physics blogger KFC writes, that means that Horizon Run 3 is 8,800 times bigger.
