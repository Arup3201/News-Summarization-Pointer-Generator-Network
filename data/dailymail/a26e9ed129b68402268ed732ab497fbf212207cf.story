Martial arts isn't something normally associated with ultra orthodox Jews - but two brothers from Jerusalem are convinced that people who practice the religion can get a real kick out of it.

Capoeira (pronounced 'cap-wearer') is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics and music.

The Hayat brothers - 24-year-old Miki and 20-year-old Yehuda - are the first in their conservative community to teach the technique, and have set up a Dojo (training room) in Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, where they tutor nearly 200 students.

The brothers work in an effort to promote the martial arts in the ultra orthodox sector in Israel.

So far their love of the martial art has not caused any issues with ultra orthodox community leaders.

And it's not likely to.

Dr Yaakov Wise, an academic expert on Orthodox Judaism at Manchester University, told MailOnline: 'Whilst Judaism forbids any form of aggressive behaviour not connected with self-defence, participating in martial arts per se is not forbidden.

'Orthodox Jews are required to "guard your health", and engaging in physical exercise that strengthens the body is often encouraged. An Orthodox Jew, Raphael Halperin, was one of the world's greatest wrestlers in the 1950s and 1960s.'

Capoeira's origins lie in 16th century Brazil, where it was developed by slaves who used dance moves to disguise the fact they were learning how to fight.

Off the wall: The brothers' love of capoeira has not caused any problems with the ultra orthodox community

Low sweeping moves are the hallmarks of the style when used in combat.

Capoeira came to the UK in 1988 and there are around 40 places across country where it can be learned.
