Whether a young Victor Valdes dreamed of one day pulling on the No 1 shirt of Manchester United as he grew up in a town south west of Barcelona is unknown.

That he thought he would be doing so in the compact settings of Leigh Sports Village, however, is unlikely.

But the 11,000-capacity home of rugby league's Leigh Centurions, complete with terraced end and next to a giant Morrison's supermarket, is exactly where the 33-year-old three-times Champions League winner pulled on the gloves for his new club for the first time. 

Manchester United keeper Victor Valdes was virtually a spectator until he was beaten by Jerome Sinclair's rasping drive

Manchester United: Victor Valdes, Patrick McNair, Tom Thorpe, Tyler Blackett, Marrick Vermijl, Anderson (Liam Grimshaw), Andreas Pereira (James Weir), Reece James, Nick Powell, Jesse Lingard, Saidy Janko

Liverpool: Lawrence Vigouroux, Ryan McLaughlin (Madger Gomes), Joe Maguire, Conor Randall, Jordan Williams, Pedro Chirivella, Sergi Canos, Cameron Brannagan, Jerome Sinclair, Jordan Ibe, Oluwaseyi Ojo.

Goal: Sinclair 42 

Everything has to start somewhere.

For Valdes this was his first outing since suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury for the Catalan giants against Celta Vigo in March. Being back between a set of posts, albeit ones that looked they were from the 90s with loops in the top corners, was the important thing.

Despite rumours he would start in Friday's FA Cup tie at Cambridge United it was this Under 21 clash with Liverpool that Louis van Gaal chose to blood the veteran.

On a chilly evening in front of 5,102, Valdes could have been forgiven for thinking about the sunnier climes of Catalonia - especially when he was a spectator for the first 42 minutes as his side dominated.

And perhaps his mind was on the beach when he was called into action for the first time - and could not prevent Jerome Sinclair's rasping drive from passing him on its way into the roof of his net to cancel out Nick Powell's opener.

Criticism is may well be harsh. The highly-rated Birmingham 18-year-old might not hit a sweeter shot all season - although Valdes will not have enjoyed being beaten at his near post. 

World-Cup winning Spaniard aside, United had fielded a strong line-up for the clash with their old rivals which included Paddy McNair, Tyler Blackett, Powell and Anderson.

With three over 21s permitted, these are often nights for the forgotten remind us of their talents and the unwanted Brazilian gave us a glimpse of a past that promised so much when he dinked a looping ball over the Liverpool defence to set Powell clear. The former Crewe man, whose loan spell at Leicester City was cut short earlier this month amid rumours of attitude issues, fired wastefully wide.

Powell, however, would make no mistake moments later - rising unmarked to head Andreas Pereira's free-kick into the turf and in.

Following Sinclair's driven leveller United re-exerted control.

Two minutes after the break they were ahead again when McNair fired into the bottom corner following good work from Powell, who looked keen to impress, and Swiss midfielder Saidy Janko.

As his side dominated Valdes again had little to do. He may well have glanced at the advertisement hoardings and wondered why he should 'try Leigh Market' as one advised, or made a note to look out for Kingstone Press Cider next time he is at the bar of his local.

If nothing else, he will have picked up the words for a few of United's favourite anti-Liverpool chants from a small group behind his goal who, among ditties, belted out the Steve Gerrard/Demba Ba song.

Joking aside there were positives. His distribution, on the rare times he had the ball, was decent and he sent more than one clearance thundering into the Liverpool half.

A win, and 90 minutes without injury will have given him plenty of reasons to be cheerful as the team bus headed past the local retail park.

The mines may have long left this part of Lancashire, but Valdes will have enjoyed his night back at the coalface.
