Former Celtic striker Henrik Larsson has stepped down as manager of Swedish minnows Falkenberg.

Despite ensuring his side maintained their top-flight status for another year, Larsson has decided to leave his role and the club is now looking for a replacement.

Falkenburg were favourites to go down before the season began but Larsson defied his miniscule budget to keep the unfancied side in the Allsvenskan, with the club describing it as their most successful season ever.

'We would have liked to see a continuation but of course we respect his decision,' sporting director Hakan Nilsson said in a statement, adding that Larsson's decision was not entirely unexpected.

On a statment on their website, Falkenburg said: 'We would like to thank Henrik Larsson for his very good work done as coach of Falkenberg FF. 

'We've got to know an amazing person and we wish him luck in the future and hope and believe he will preserve this year in Falkenberg in his heart.'

The 43-year-old, who also played for Barcelona and Manchester United during his career, has been linked with the manager's job at IFK Gothenburg following the sacking of Mikael Stahre a week ago.
