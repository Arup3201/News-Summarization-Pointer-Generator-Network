The Royal Bahamas Defense Force said on Sunday that the charred corpses of three men and one woman have been found on Anguilla Cay. The barren, uninhabited cay is relatively close to Cuba

He says investigators suspect the people may have been Haitian migrants. However, there was no sign of a vessel or any evidence to determine how the four victims arrived on the cay.

The corpses have been brought to New Providence, the main island of the country of over 700 islands, islets and cays off Florida's eastern coast.

'We arrived at the cay shortly after sunrise yesterday (Thursday) morning and within minutes we were able to locate the bodies based on the odor that was being emitted,' said Raymond King.

'The bodies were badly burned,' he told The Nassau Guardian.

On Tuesday the Assistant Commissioner of Police Andy Ferguson said that police hadn't yet found any bodies on the cay and even used a helicopter in their initial search and found nothing.

He said that on Thursday they were able to conduct a more thorough search and find the bodies.

When asked how the bodies might have ended up on the Cay, King said, 'There weren't any signs of any vessel being shipwrecked, so we have no idea in terms of how the bodies were taken to the cay or how they met their fate on Anguilla Cay, he said.
