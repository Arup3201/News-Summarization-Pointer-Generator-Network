A middle aged couple dropped off a newborn baby girl still covered in amniotic fluid to a Lakewood, Colorado fire station on Tuesday after it was given to them at a Walmart.

The baby didn't belong to the couple but was given to them by strangers at a Lakewood Walmart parking lot that morning. 

The fire department did not reveal any more details about the baby's biological parents but they do not believe that the middle-aged couple knew them in any way.

Abandoned baby: A mother gave her newborn baby daughter, still covered in amniotic fluid, to a middle-aged couple at the Walmart in Lakewood, Colorado 

Khou reports that the baby, while not wiped off, seemed healthy but was given to paramedics to ensure its safety.

'The child didn’t look like it had been completely cleaned off. Still had some amniotic fluid dried on. It just had the appearance of a baby that had just been born very recently,' said firefighter and paramedic Cody Beinlich.

A law passed in Colorado called The Safe Haven Law makes it legal for the parents of an unwanted child to drop in at a hospital or fire station up to 72 hours after the birth.

Any longer than 72 hours and a parent can face up to 26 years in prison.

Even though the baby was dropped at a fire station, it was not delivered by the parents and therefore is not fully covered in the law.

Police are searching for the baby's mother both over concerns about her health and because charges may be warranted against her.

The baby's mother committed a crime of abandonment.

Linda Prudhomme who works with the Colorado Safe Haven for Newborns, told ABC News that since the law passed in 2000, 40 babies have been safely taken into care.

'If the couple who dropped the baby off are relatives or the parents of the baby — and made up the story about the mother in the parking lot — then the circumstances fall under the Safe Haven Law. If it is determined that the baby was legally abandoned, police will write a report but will not pursue the mother,' she said.

Prudhomme said that the baby's actual mother didn’t correctly abide by the law.

'If a parent handed over the child to total strangers and they took it to a fire station, then the parent could be charged criminally, but that part of the story has not been substantiated,' said Steve Davis with the police department.

Firefighters do not know the future of the baby but they said that they will always remember the bizarre day she was dropped off at their station and that the wish her the best in what's to come.

The law does not apply to the baby's parent's, however, because they abandoned their daughter at a Walmart
