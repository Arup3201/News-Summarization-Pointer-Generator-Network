Health and safety at Selfridges came under the spotlight after a grandmother who smashed her leg when she slipped on a plastic icicle in a Santa's Grotto won the right to up to £30,000 damages.

Joan Dufosse, 73, was having a photo taken with her family at the company's flagship store in Oxford Street when she stepped on an icicle-shaped Christmas tree bauble and was sent crashing to the ground.

Mrs Dufosse, of Richlans Road, Hedge End, Southampton, fractured her left thigh and had to be rushed to hospital.

She needed major surgery to plate and screw the fracture and has yet to make a full recovery from the incident in November 2009.

Mrs Dufosse, who was at Selfridges with 
her son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, claimed compensation 
from Melbry Events Ltd, which ran the grotto, but had her claim rejected
by a judge at Southampton County Court in March.

After a hearing in which 'Santa' David Warren and his 'elf' Sarah Chamberlain, were the star witnesses, Judge John Sparrow said the icicle was 'not in plain view' and cleared Melbry Events of blame for Mrs Dufosse's pre-Christmas catastrophe.

But that decision has now been 
reversed at London's Civil Appeal Court, where Lord Justice Rix, Sir 
Mark Potter and Lord Justice McFarlane ruled that the 'offending icicle'
should have been spotted by Santa or his little helper.

Opening Mrs Dufosse's appeal, her 
barrister, John Bate-Williams, said: 'This case may have entertaining 
ingredients, but this accident had very serious consequences for Mrs 
Dufosse.'

'We were warned off by Judge Sparrow 
from any lightheartedness and so we were unable to use the phrase "elf 
and safety"', added Mr Bate-Williams as he handed the icicle up to the 
bench for the three judges' perusal.

Attacking 
Judge Sparrow's decision to dismiss Mrs Dufosse's claim, the barrister 
said: 'There was no justification for the finding that the bauble was 
partly hidden. Even if it was partly concealed, the defendants should 
have noticed it.

'It 
was not the family's responsibility to see this icicle. They had the 
excitement of grandchildren going to see Father Christmas and a very 
pretty elf beckoning them in.

'It
is absolutely the responsibility of the elf and father Christmas at all
times to keep the grotto clean and tidy,' he told the court.

Sir
Mark Potter, giving his assessment of the case, said: 'The family went 
in, preceded by the elf. Santa was there on his throne. There were eight
people in a three-by-four metre room.

'There are 10 or 11,000 customers going through (the grotto) in the course of a season. Its a factory environment essentially.

'It
doesn't strain credulity that Father Christmas, left alone after 
possibly the 33rd visit of the day, didn't do a radar sweep to see 
whether there is an unexpected icicle.'

Lord
Justice Rix, allowing Mrs Dufosse's appeal, said Santa or the elf ought
to have seen the stray icicle, and dismissed claims that the 
grandmother was partly to blame for not spotting it herself.

He
praised the 'excellence of the system' of safety checks Melbry Events 
had in place, but went on to conclude that human error by Santa and the 
elf had led to the accident.

'Mrs Dufosse fell and injured her leg. Why had she fallen, and was it anything to do with breach of statutory duties or negligence?' the judge asked.

'On the findings, the icicle was there and it was tripped over. The question is whether it was there to be seen.'

He added: 'This was a 72-year-old 
woman going with her family and grandchildren on what was, for all of 
them, an exciting visit to Santa's Grotto in which the anticipated 
pleasure of the children would have been foremost in their minds,' he 
went on.

'There were eight 
people in quite a small space. The accident happened when Mrs Dufosse, 
at the request of the elf, stepped sideways and backward into the 
corner.

'It was not her duty in these circumstances to ensure there were no tripping hazards in the room which might cause something amiss. This was purely the duty of Santa and the elf.'

The
other judges agreed with his ruling, and the company was ordered to pay
the legal costs of the case.

The exact amount of damages Mrs Dufosse 
will receive will now be either agreed or assessed at a further court 
hearing, but it is believed it could be up to £30,000.
