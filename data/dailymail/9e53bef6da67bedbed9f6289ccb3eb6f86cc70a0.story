A 20-year-old woman found dead in Utah earlier this week had succumbed to the freezing temperatures after her car keys went missing in the woods during a night of drinking, police revealed Friday.

Hadley Boberg, 20, and a male friend she was with were up in Provo Canyon, elevation 7,420 feet, Wednesday night apparently drinking alcohol and doing some hiking, authorities said.

When they set off to return to their Jeep, they realized they didn't have the keys, The Utah County Sheriff's office said in a news release.

Tragic death: Hadley Boberg, 20, froze to death after a night of drinking in Provo Canyon, Utah

Fatal mishap: Boberg and her friend lost the keys to her black Jeep Wranger, and she died while looking for them

As they rummaged through the oak brush
 and trees, temperatures dipped well below freezing. They never found 
the keys or made it back to the Jeep.

At some point, Boberg lost consciousness and never woke up, authorities said.

Authorities
 found her body Thursday morning after her parents reported her missing.
 They also found the 21-year-old man wandering barefoot and dazed in the
 area.

The
 friend was evasive and seemed confused during interviews with 
detectives. That, coupled with the scratches and cuts he had led them to
 initially label it a suspicious death.

So close: Boberg was unconscious and not breathing when she was found about 200 yards away from her Jeep

But
 an autopsy report showed the cause of death was alcohol and exposure to
 the cold, and authorities now believe it was a tragic accident.

Investigators found several empty bottles of alcohol in the area.

Weather records indicated it likely was about 17 degrees in the canyon the night Boberg died. 

Boberg told friends she was going for
 a drive in Hobble Creek Canyon but never returned home. Deputies 
searched other nearby canyons before discovering her car and body around
 10:30am Thursday.

Utah County sheriff's deputies 
discovered Boberg at Provo Canyon elevation, 7,420 feet, where she had spent the night lying on the snow-covered ground in 17-degree weather

A deputy found the young woman's prized Jeep Wrangler near the Big Springs trail in South Fork, Provo Canyon.

Boberg was unconscious and not breathing when she was found about 200 yards away from her Jeep. She only had one shoe one, with the other lying nearby.

Her friend was found barefoot and confused, suffering possible frostbite and has been admitted to hospital for observation.

Police
 said as the inebriated friends crawled on the ground searching for the 
keys, the pair became wet from the snow. At some point, the 20-year-old 
victim laid down or possiblly tripped and fell. 

According
 to her Facebook page, Boberg was a Mormon. The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter Day Saints prohibits its members from consuming alcohol.
