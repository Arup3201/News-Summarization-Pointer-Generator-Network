Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott were among the players who paid tribute to the late Phillip Hughes at the Australian Open on Friday.

Australia is mourning the loss of the cricketer, who tragically died on Thursday two days after being struck in the back of the head by a bouncer while batting for South Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

McIlroy and Co are in action this week just three miles away at the Australian Golf Club and the players wore black ribbons on their caps in memory of Hughes.

Greg Chalmers held a one-shot lead at the halfway stage of the tournament but McIlroy moved himself in position to defend his title over the weekend after claiming a share of second place. 

Chalmers, twice a former winner of his national open, snared his seventh birdie on the last green for a five-under-par 66 to edge ahead of a congested leading pack at five-under for the tournament.

The 41-year-old was not getting too carried away with his early lead, however, with the world No 1 on his heels after a second 69 and Adam Scott having revived his tournament with a sparkling 66.

'I think it's very early to be talking about winning given who's right behind me and who's playing very well,' he told reporters.

'Very early to be thinking about what's going to happen on Sunday night.'

McIlroy had an up and down round with an eagle, six birdies and six bogies for a share of second with American Conrad Schindler as well as Australians Adam Crawford and Todd Sinnott on four-under.

'I felt like I had an opportunity today to shoot a good one and put a little bit of space between myself and the rest of the field but it didn't really turn out that way,' said the Northern Irishman.

'A few too many mistakes and it was pretty tricky out there to be honest. Swirling quite a bit, which made it hard for club selection. Misjudged a few wedged shots and got bogies from those.

'I was happy with how I finished, picked up shots in four of the last five holes and I'm still in a good position heading into tomorrow.'

Overnight leader Jordan Spieth had a day to forget, bogeying two of his first four holes and finishing with a 72 to drop to a share of sixth on three-under with three others.

'It was a struggle, big time struggle,' he said. 'I wasn't hitting it well. If I wasn't putting well I may have shot 45 on the back nine.'

Scott was in a group of six players sharing ninth on two-under having soared back into contention with a blemish-free 66 that was also fired by an eagle at the 14th.

The 34-year-old former Masters champion, an early starter, held the course record on the newly-reconfigured layout at The Australian Golf Club for half an hour until Jamie Lovemark completed a round of 65.

'We had a good morning for it, so I had to take advantage just for the sake of getting back in the tournament,' Scott said.
