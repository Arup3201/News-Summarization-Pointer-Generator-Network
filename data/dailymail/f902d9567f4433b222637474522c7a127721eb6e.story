Werribee Zoo has made the heartbreaking decision to euthanise a newborn white rhino after it was discovered the calf had been born with an aggressive bacterial infection in her stomach.

Veterinary staff at Werribee Open Range Zoo, just outside of Melbourne, made the call to euthanise the three-day-old female Southern White Rhino calf after she underwent an endoscopy which revealed the infection had done irreparable damage to her stomach.

Sally Lewis, director of Werribee Zoo, said that the loss was deeply distressing for the team who had provided expert care to the rhino calf from the moment she was born.

'For the last three days our veterinary team have worked around the clock to care for our rhino calf and to lose her now, after those critical first few days is devastating,' said Ms Lewis.

The calf's older sister Kipenzi had been born with a similar infection, so signs of the calf's illness had been identified soon after her birth.

Blood tests revealed that she had an elevated white blood count and that she had been born with an infection passed on from her mum,' said Senior Veterinarian Dr Natalie Rourke.

'We were able to identify it quickly and begin antibiotic treatment. Despite this initial infection she was feeding well, had good movement and we were cautiously optimistic about her progress,' Dr Rourke said.

The decision was made to perform an ultrasound and endoscopy on the calf when she began to lose interest in drinking her milk and was showing signs of discomfort despite being given medication.

'The loss of this calf is a huge blow for us, particularly with a species that is so under threat,' said Ms Lewis

On Sunday afternoon the tests revealed that the young calf's stomach lining had become enflamed and she was battling an incurable infection. 

'When we examined the rhino calf under anaesthetic we found that the damage to her stomach was so severe that any attempt at surgery would only prolong her pain,' said Dr Rourke.

Dr Rourke said that the team were then forced to make the 'heartbreaking' decision to end the calf's suffering.  

Director Sally Lewis said the past few days had been an extremely difficult time for the whole team at Werribee Zoo.

'The loss of this calf is a huge blow for us, particularly with a species that is so under threat,' said Ms Lewis.

'We’ve been overwhelmed by the response from the community over the last few days, as they have shared our joy in the arrival of this precious baby and our concern about her health,' she said.

'We thank them now for their support during this difficult time.'
