A woman who accidentally flushed her diamond ring down the toilet has described her surprise after sewer workers returned it to her the following day. 

After losing 10lbs Pat Hanson's ring fell off of her finger and was accidentally flushed down the toilet in Central Park, Oregon.

'I just panicked. I wanted to dive down that toilet right after it,' Ms Hanson told Medford Mail Tribune.  

Family heirloom: Pat Hanson was stunned when sewer workers returned a diamond ring that she had accidentally flushed down the toilet a day previously

Ms Hanson says the ring dates to 1920. Her mother died in 1989, and she's been wearing it daily since then.

Since the day she lost the ring was a Sunday, she says there was little she could do but pray. The next morning she and a friend went to the regional sewer utility.

Despite the sewer workers' best efforts, they were unable to find the ring and had to break the bad news to Ms Hanson.

But the next day, without telling her, they went back to work.

'We didn't want to get her hopes up,' operations manager Shane Macuk said. They spent hours trying to find Ms Hanson's ring.

Finally, after hours looking, worker Travis Cox spotted the ring and the crew managed to get it out.

With the ring cleaned up, repaired and resized, Hanson is praising the sewer workers and crediting the patron saint of lost items.

'I'd done a lot of praying to St. Anthony,' she said. 'I feel I ought to write a letter to the Pope and let him know we had a miracle here in Central Point.'
