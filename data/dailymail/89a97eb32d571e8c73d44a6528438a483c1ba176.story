Whether it's camping in the UK, or on a luxury break in the Caribbean, Stacey Solomon is a keen traveller.

The mother-of-two reality TV star, who rose to fame on the X Factor, says she's at home anywhere - naming the stunning Rhossili in Wales as her favourite beach in the world.

However, as is fitting for a queen (of the jungle, Stacey won I'm A Celebrity...), the 24-year-old, from Dagenham, Essex, doesn't shy away from five-start treatment - citing the five-star Atlantis in Dubai as the best hotel on the planet.

Travel about her holiday plans for this year, her most embarrassing holiday horror, and how to keep children happy when travelling.

If the weather is going to be as warm in England as everyone keeps saying, I’d like to do a camping trip along the British coast. It would be great to pack up the car with all our essentials and drive somewhere to enjoy the seaside with the children (Zachary and Leighton).

I loved a trip to Mersey camping with my brothers and sisters when I was younger. I was about 12 and I enjoyed cooking our own food, sleeping in a tent and toasting marshmallows on a camp fire. We spent the week having good old fashion fun and playing cards.

Dream trip: For a two-week holiday, the Caribbean is Stacey's choice for a top sunshine holiday

When you have a two-week holiday, you can afford to go somewhere further without feeling like you lose too much time travelling. My top choice would either be somewhere in Mexico or the Caribbean. 

My
 favourite beach is Rhossili beach in Wales. We went there a lot when I 
was younger and it has the BEST sand dunes. We never got bored of 
rolling down them, day after day.

Top choice: Stacey's favourite beach of all is Rhossili Bay, on the Gower Peninsula in Wales

Diving equipment. I’ve been diving a couple of times in Egypt and the equipment costs a bomb.

My favourite attraction in the UK has to be Legoland. At the moment my children aren't old enough for the big theme park rides so Legoland is perfect. We can spend hours looking at all the fab Lego structures.

'Insane': The Atlantic Hotel in Dubai gets Stacey's vote for the best hotel she's ever stayed in

I
 took Zachary to Barcelona a couple of years ago and thought it was 
fantastic. The harbour was beautiful and the city is full of history, we
 had such fun exploring.

The Spanish are so friendly and love children 
so it was a great place to take him. There was a park on every road 
which meant he was a happy boy.

Having been caught out in rental cars without a booster seat, I now always travel with an inflatable BubbleBum booster seat, as they’re easy to pack and squeeze in your handbag.  

Favourite attraction: Stacey reveals she likes to take her children to Legoland

A favourite travel experience was meeting a group of inspiring women in Malawi

I visited Malawi where I met a group of women who were amazing. They had all recently lost children, none of them had a proper home and they were struggling to gather food and water.

Despite their troubles they all remained positive and didn’t take anything for granted. They spent the whole day dancing and singing and smiling. They told me about all of the good things that were going on in their lives. They are the most interesting and inspiring people I have ever met on my travels.

Keeping kids entertained on car journeys makes family travel much less stressful and much more enjoyable, so preparation is key. I take books and games to keep my children occupied and lots of snacks to distract them.
