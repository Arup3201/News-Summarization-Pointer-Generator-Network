While many parents turn to toys and lullabies to soothe their babies, the latest parenting trend forbids these crutches, instead encouraging us to treat children like adults.

Resources for Infant Educarers, also known as RIE and pronounced 'wry', was founded in 1978 by early childhood educator Magda Gerber, who advocated respect between a parent and child and said adults should allow their children to solve problems without interference.

The parenting trend - which promises more competent and self-aware children in the long run - has already taken hold among celebrities including Jamie Lee Curtis, Tobey Maguire and Penelope Cruz, but some experts warn it could do more harm than good.

Mini grown-ups: The latest trend in parenting is Resources for Infant Educarers, also known as RIE and pronounced 'wry', which advocates treating babies and children like adults

RIE teaches that instead of artificial
 and constant distractions like toys and sports classes, babies need 
relaxation and natural stimulation to fully develop.

Deborah
 Carlisle Solomon's new book, Baby Knows Best, is the most recent 
incarnation of the RIE parenting guide based on Gerber's teachings.

According to an Amazon description,
 the book explores 'babies' natural abilities to develop at their own 
pace, without coaxing from helicoptering or hovering parents'.

The
 list of typically baby-related things banned according to orthodox RIE 
followers is extensive, from baby bouncers, sippy cups and high chairs 
to rattles, pacifiers, baby talk and toys.

'Children donâ€™t need toys,' Ms Solomon writes in her book. 'Almost all of the toys at RIE can be found in somebody's cupboard.'

Enthusiast: Tobey Maguire (pictured in November 2013 with daughter Ruby) is one of the many celebrity believers in RIE, which discourages the use of high chairs, toys, pacifiers and baby talk

Pacifiers are also looked down on since, as Gerber once wrote, 'the pacifier is a plug. It does stop a child from crying, but the question is, Does an infant have a right to cry?'

Instead of trying to soothe a baby with tickling, lullabies or rocking them to sleep, RIE dictates that parents should let them cry as long as they want.

The idea is that babies and children 
know much more than we give them credit for, and they should 
therefore be treated with respect as fully-functioning humans.

As such, it advocates that baby talk 
should be replaced with long, adult conversations - a concept that goes 
against a recent study by researchers at the University of Washington 
and the University of Connecticut.

Good advice: William H Macy and wife Felicity Huffman (pictured with daughters in March 2013) are also proponents of the parenting method, which was originally developed in the 1940s by Magda Gerber

Understanding your kids: Penelope Cruz (pictured in June 2012), who, with husband Javier Bardem, practices RIE, has said: 'Children perceive everything. They are really smart'

According to the study's co-author Dr Patricia Juhl, it
 found that 'the prevalence of baby talk in one-on-one conversations with
 children is linked to better language development, both concurrent and 
future.'

'The pacifier is a plug. It stops a child from crying, but doesn't an infant have a right to cry?'

Indeed, the more parents exaggerated 
vowels - for example 'How are youuuuu?' - and raised the pitch of their 
voices, the more the one-year-olds babbled, which is a forerunner of 
word production.

Despite this conflicting theory, many proponents of RIE - including 
Penelope Cruz - say its teachings are the key to successful parenting.

The 39-year-old actress, who has two children with her husband Javier Bardem, told the Wall Street Journal in December that she is a devoted follower of the parenting technique.

Self-improvement: And according to Jamie Lee Curtis (with daughter Annie in 2010): 'RIE takes you back to basics. RIE makes us all better. Better parents. Better partners. Better people'

'Children perceive everything,' she said. 'They are really smart.'

And Jamie Lee Curtis, whose two adopted children are now 17 and 27, told Vanity Fair: 'RIE takes you back to basics. RIE makes us all better. Better parents. Better partners. Better people.'

Nevertheless, problems can arise in that RIE doesn't allow a parent to interfere with their child, even if he or she is in a fight.

Author Annabelle Gurtwich told Vanity Fair about a time that her child was attending an RIE snack time with other children, one of whom 'started shoving huge tables at the babies on the floor'.

At first, the mothers, though panicked, simply sat back and watched since they were supposed to never interfere.

'Finally, I stood up and said, "Are you f****** kidding me? This is dangerous,"' explained Ms Gurtwich. 'I picked my kid up and took him out of the circle, and all the other mothers followed.'

Still, it's not just trend-concious celebrities who have sung RIE's praises; all five reviews of Ms Solomon's book on Amazon are gushing.

'Parenting is the hardest job there is,' wrote one enthusiast. 'And this book has the antidote to so many of the traps and dysfunctional patterns that families get stuck in because of lack of awareness.'

Another said the book is 'an interesting comment on how each of us can simplify and improve our relationships by assuming all individuals, as well as babies, are competent and can make good decisions.'
