Foreign students with low grades are being offered places at top British universities ahead of pupils with better marks in this country, an investigation has revealed.

Universities have been accused of making money by rejecting British teenagers so they can fill places with international students who are charged 50 per cent more than the annual £9,000 tuition fees paid by UK and European students.

An investigation found that the official agent in Beijing for the elite Russell Group claimed to be able to secure over-subscribed places for a Chinese student with three C grades at A-level - when British students need at least AAB.

The University of Sussex denied the allegations which were made after an investigation into agents for prospective overseas students

Undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph were also told that, in order to secure a 
visa, they should tell the UK authorities that the student would return 
home immediately after graduation - even if this was not the case.

Headteachers at private schools have claimed that some of their foreign pupils have been offered places requiring lower grades than their British counterparts.

One education expert warned there was risk that standards will fall as universities overlook better-qualified candidates in favour of those who pay higher fees.

The reporters visited Golden Arrows Consulting in Beijing, which placed more than 2,500 students in British universities in 2011, claiming to be looking for a place for a Chinese student who had three C grades.

Despite being below the entry requirements of most leading British universities, the fictitious student was offered a place at both Cardiff and Sussex.

The agent, Fiona Wang said: 'We send student [sic] to Cardiff Business School to study accounting and finance with ACD. So with CCC we can help her.'

An applicant would normally need AAB to take the course at the university.

'If the student wants to study economics, it’s three Cs. So economics she can also do,' the agent added.

Ms Wang said that the grades meant that she could also ‘choose’ between the University of East Anglia or Southampton University but not Bristol, King’s College London or Warwick.

Another Golden Arrow employee reportedly offered to doctor documents to help the student’s application, including visa paperwork and offered assistance with the applicant’s personal statement.

The number of foreign students in Britain has risen by a third to almost 300,000 since 2006, with the highest proportion coming from China, while the number of British students missing out on a university place reached a peak of 180,000 in 2011.

Universities are allowed to make discretionary offers to students and there are no rules governing entry requirements.

It is believed that many wealthy parents would be prepared to pay the higher fees charged to international students, but the system prevents this.

Richard Cairns, the headmaster at Brighton College, said: 'Universities are increasingly searching for, and needing, overseas fees. It’s something we have noticed. It’s tougher for British students to get into top universities than overseas students.'

Andrew Halls, the headmaster of King's College School in Wimbledon, south-west London, told the Telegraph that he had advised pupils they stand a chance of receiving a better offer if they can apply as international candidates.

Last month 68 chancellors, governors and university presidents warned that any crackdown could lead to foreign students going elsewhere, costing the economy billions.

In a letter to the Prime Minister they said Britain attracts around one in 10 students who study outside their home country, generating around £8billion a year in tuition fees.

Universities take such a valued revenue stream very seriously, with almost all having a dedicated page on their websites listing 'partners' in other countries for prospective students to contact about getting a place.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, told the Telegraph money was the 'main factor' leading universities to push for foreign students.

He said there was a risk that educational standards could be compromised as establishments try to secure their future in an era of uncertain funding.

From September the Government will 
make changes to the system aimed at ensuring that high-performing 
teenagers are not denied university places.

It will remove a cap on the number of British students a university can recruit if the applicant had A-level grades of AAB.

The threshold is due to be lowered to 
ABB next year, although only a few universities have indicated that they
 will participate because of concerns over the cost of admitting more 
British students.

Golden Arrow admitted that it had found a place for a student at Cardiff with ACD grades but said it was an exceptional case.

The firm denied offering to doctor applications and said it only ‘instructs’ students’ on personal statements but would never 'write on behalf of them'.

Sussex and Cardiff Universities denied offering places to international students with lower grades. The University of Southampton said it would be investigating the allegations.
