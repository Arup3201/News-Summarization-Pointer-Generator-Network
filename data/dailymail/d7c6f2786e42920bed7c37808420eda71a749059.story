Louis van Gaal persisting with Wayne Rooney as a central midfielder is seriously hampering Manchester United, according to Jamie Carragher.

Rooney was deployed in a diamond midfield by Van Gaal during United's 1-1 Premier League draw at West Ham on Sunday.

The 29-year-old's role away from the front line has been a tactic of Van Gaal's this season as he looks to fit an array of attacking stars into his starting line-up.

Jamie Carragher believes Manchester United are wasting the talents of Wayne Rooney in midfield

Again Van Gaal partnered Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao up front but the duo failed to work effectively in tandem - with the latter missing a glorious chance to score in the second half.

Carragher believes Van Gaal should utilise the qualities of Rooney properly by playing him in his natural position - after he failed to have a single touch in the West Ham penalty area on Sunday.

'[Wayne] Rooney's position is not right, he was playing as a defensive midfield player,' Carragher said after the match as a pundit for Sky Sports.

'Why is he (Van Gaal) not putting Rooney up off the front, with two strikers showing such a lack of movement? They had less touches today than [David] De Gea.'

United fell behind to West Ham after Cheikhou Kouyate's brilliant finish four minutes into the second half.

But Van Gaal rolled the dice by throwing on Marouane Fellaini  as his side turned to a long-ball style with Daley Blind volleying home their equaliser in injury-time.
