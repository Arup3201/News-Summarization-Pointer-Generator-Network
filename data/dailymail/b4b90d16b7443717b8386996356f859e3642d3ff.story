A young Missouri man who has spent almost a decade in prison for a crime he says he didn't commit had his 40-year sentence vacated by an appeals court today.

Ryan Ferguson was 19 when he was arrested for the 2001 murder of Columbia sports editor Kent Heitholt.

His parents, Leslie and Bill Ferguson, who have tirelessly campaigned to have the conviction overturned, clapped and hugged as they read the decision of the appeals court online this morning.

Relief: Bill and Leslie Ferguson heard that their son Ryan's murder conviction had been vacated this morning

Overwhelmed: Ryan Ferguson, pictured in prison, was told over the phone that his 40-year sentence had been vacated

According to the ruling today, the state
now has 15 days to decide whether he will face a retrial. If no 
decision is made in that time frame he will be unconditionally 
discharged.

'It's amazing,' Mrs Ferguson told CBS, which featured the case on 48 Hours. 'We're just really happy that finally we 
have judges who looked at the facts in the case and ruled on that. They 
did what was right.'

Sports editor Kent Heitholt was found beaten and strangled by his own belt in his office car park at about 2.20am on November 1, 2001.

Police had no leads in the case until two years later when Chuck Erikson, a heavy drug user, saw a photo fit he believed looked like him.

Erikson, who had no recollection of his movements on the night Mr Heitholt died, told police he believed he and Ryan Ferguson, who had been out together in the area that night, may have been responsible.

Ferguson has consistently denied he was involved but, despite no motive or  evidence linking him or Erikson to the crime scene, he was sentenced to 40 years in prison. 

In 2010 Erikson, who still has no memory of the night in question and is serving a 25-year sentence, said Ferguson was not involved. 

No evidence links the men to footprints, hair and finger prints at the scene, but police have not named any other suspects in the case.

Ryan Ferguson, who is now 29, heard of the decision over the phone in prison. 'I kind of felt like I wasn't awake - been 
dreaming of it so long,' he said.

'My reaction - it's not - wouldn't be like "Yay 
bouncing off the walls", cause in reality I know it's the beginning of 
another battle. Even though we crossed a huge hurdle, I don't feel like I
have my life back.'

The cautious optimism of the young man is understandable for someone who was 21 when he was sentenced to 40 years for a murder his friend Chuck Erikson had
implicated him in, despite Erikson not remembering any details of the 
night in question.

Despite his consistent denials and no physical evidence linking him to the murder scene, Ferguson had his hopes raised and dashed by several appeal hearings. 

'Under the facts and circumstances of
this case, we conclude that Ferguson did not receive a fair trial,' 
Judge Cynthia Martin wrote in a summary of today's ruling. 'His verdict is 
not worthy of judicial or public confidence.'

The decision was celebrated on the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook page, with a post that read: 'Looks like we'll need to change the name of this page to "Freed" Ryan Ferguson.'

The post 'liked' by more than 14,000 of the young man's supporters in just a few hours.

Celebration: Details of the successful appeal were posted on the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook page

Appeal: Ryan Ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of Kent Heitholt

The details of his case have 
concerned legal experts for years. An appeal last year was denied even 
though a witness and Ferguson's alleged accomplice recanted their 
confessions.

November 1, 2001
Kent Heitholt, sports editor of the Columbia Daily Tribune, is found 
beaten and strangled in the office car park at about 2.20am.

March 2004 Chuck Erikson is charged and arrested with murder and robbery after telling police he believes he may have been involved.

March 2004 Ryan Ferguson is also charged and arrested but denies any involvement.

December 2005 Ferguson is found guilty of murder and robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison.

November 2006 The first of several appeals is made and denied.

November 2010 Erikson claims he acted alone on the night of the murder.

October 2010 Witness Jerry Trump, a janitor at the newspaper, recants his statement.

April 2012 Erikson and Trump both officially recant their witness statements at a hearing for Ferguson.

October 2012 A judge denies Ferguson's habeaus corpus petition despite no evidence linking him to the case.

September 2013 Ferguson's case goes back to the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals.

November 5, 2013 The appeals court vacates Ferguson's sentence, paving the way for him to be freed within 15 days.

Ferguson's 
conviction was based on the testimony from witnesses Jerry Trump, a 
janitor, and  Erikson, who feared he may have been involved after seeing
a photofit of the suspects.

With
his freedom finally in sight, Ferguson's attention is now focused on 
Erikson who implicated him and is serving 25 years for second-degree 
murder.

'I believe he is totally innocent [too],' Ferguson told CBS. 'I don't see how he could have been at the crime scene. I just don't think it's possible.'

Chief
Legal Analyst for ABC, Dan Abrams, said earlier this year that there 
would be no evidence to convict Ferguson is a retrial is ordered.

A
bloody footprint and hair found at the crime scene did not match him, 
and the witnesses whose testimony his conviction was based on, later 
admitted they had lied under oath.

Ferguson has constantly proclaimed his evidence, ever since Erikson told police they had been involved in the crime two years after
Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Mr Heitholt was discovered 
strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of November 1, 
2001.

Erikson told police 
the pair, who had been 17 at the time, had been drinking underage at a 
nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in 
question.

After 
reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was 
involved, saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked 
like him.

In his police interviews Erikson, who 
was a drug user, was unable to give details of the crime, wrongly 
stating that Mr Heitholt had been strangled by a shirt, or a bungee 
cord, before the detective questioning him tells Erikson it was a belt.

He claimed however, that he struck the editor once, before Ferguson strangled him.

'The
police threatened me to implicate Ferguson or else I would be solely 
responsible for Heitholt’s death and be charged with first-degree murder
and possibly sentenced to death,' Erickson said in an affidavit.

Confess: A mug shot of Chuck Erikson, right, who said he was involved after seeing a photofit, right, in a paper

Memory loss: Chuck Erikson, who says he cannot remember the night of the murder, recently retracted his statement that Ryan Ferguson was involved

Despite fingerprints, a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching Erikson or Ferguson, police arrested them.

'Everything is wrong about this case, 
everything's wrong about it. It makes absolutely no sense,' Kathleen 
Zellner, who worked on Ferguson's appeal, told the court.

Ferguson stated to police that on the night Mr Heitholt was killed, he and Erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home.

Tribute: Victim Kent Heitholt was the sports editor at the Columbia Daily Tribune and a father of two

Crime scene: The sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park

Erikson is now saying that although he still has no memory of 
the night in question, he believes he acted alone.

Victim: Sports editor Kent Heitholt was found strangled in his newspaper's car park

Tribune janitor Trump, who said
he saw the young men at the scene, also later admitted under oath that 
he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown.

In his police interview, Erikson said: 'I could just be fabricating it all and not know. This is after reading the newspaper article in October and this is kinda what I put together with what could've happened.'

He went on to say: 'From there on I'm just presuming what happened. I'm making presumptions based on what I read in the newspaper.'

According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive, was never thoroughly investigated.

Fellow sportswriter Michael Boyd had left the office the same time as Heitholt, who was married with two children. He says that he drove off before Heitholt. 

The 1991 blue Oldsmobile he was 
driving that night was never searched, and he traded it shortly 
afterwards. Police have never been able to trace it.

A forensic pathologist, Dr Larry Blum, has examined evidence from the trial for Ms Zellner, CBS said.

He claims that the tire tool Erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries.

Campaign: Ryan Ferguson, left, with his father Bill and sister, Kelly, who are trying to have him released

Support: Bill Ferguson has constantly campaigned for his son's release and recently drove across the U.S. in a car featuring details of Ryan's case 

He added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes, meaning Mr Boyd put himself at the scene very close to the time
the crime was reported.

According to CBS Mr Boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20am, 
only six minutes before 911 was called.

Mr Boyd, who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime, told 48 Hours that he returned to
the car park later that night after hearing about the murder.

Ferguson's family have 
gone to great lengths to raise awareness about his case, 
including driving a car emblazoned with his picture across the U.S.
