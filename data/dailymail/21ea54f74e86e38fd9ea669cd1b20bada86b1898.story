An investment banker found dead after trying to climb the Northeast's highest peak was using a broken emergency beacon and could have saved herself if she turned her cellphone on, rescuers have claimed.   

Kate Matrosova, 32, dropped off by her husband Charlie Farhoodi  at the base of New Hampshire's 5,400ft Mount Madison at 5am last Sunday.

Within hours she had activated an emergency beacon amid but a team was unable to locate her in the blizzard because mountaineers say the sub-zero temperatures prevented it from working properly. 

Her body was discovered 24 hours later, with emergency responders being sent in the wrong direction by the faulty technology. Others have said it was 'negligent' for her to be up there and her decisions showed her 'inexperience'.

Emergency: A search team was unable to locate Matrosova (pictured in January) for 24 hours after her call

When she activated the tracking device, it triggered an instantaneous alert at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida.  

Operators called the number associated with account, but it went straight to voicemail because her phone was switched off.

It meant no one dialed 911 until her husband, who was sitting in his hotel room at the time, was contacted by staff at the Florida base. 

Volunteer mountain rescuer Steve Larson told the Boston Globe if they had Mastrova's correct location they would not have spent hours trekking through the woodland in the wrong direction.

'One lesson in all this, for all of this whiz-bang technology, it obviously is not spot-on,' he said. 

Fish and Game Lieutenant Wayne Saunders said her beacon was designed to function in temperatures as low as minus 20.

But he said the air was far colder, meaning it could have tricked the technology. 

Mike Pelchat, a states park employee, added: 'Maybe she relied a little too much on the technology. Maybe she thought she could turn back. But the temperatures, and the wind, got the best of her.' 

Max Lurie, 28, who responded to the second Mountain Rescue Service call, told the Globe: 'It was cold — one of the coldest nights of the year — and the wind was howling. I don’t go up there when there are conditions like that.

'It was negligent for her to be up there. Her decision clearly speaks to her inexperience.'   

Grueling: Mt Madison (pictured, not with Matrosova) was hit by 100 mph winds and a blizzard on Sunday night

She had been attempting to climb the Presidential Range of the White Mountains - which includes the highest peak in the Northeast - Mount Washington - elevation 6,300 feet 

Russia-born Matrosova, who lived in a $1 million apartment in Midtown Manhattan with Farhoodi, planned to climb to the top of  Madison before venturing across three other summits in the so-called Presidential Range, reports claim.

As the day progressed, the region was hit by winds exceeding 100mph and temperatures plummeted to -30F.

The BNP Paribas credit trader  sent her coordinates to rescuers on Sunday afternoon. 

After a failed attempt on Sunday, a National Guard crew flew over the area with a helicopter on Monday morning but couldn't see anything because of blowing snow and had to turn back.

'Unfortunately, a lot of the coordinates that we received over the night were all over the place within a mile circumference,' Fish and Game Lt. Jim Goss told WMUR-TV.

Mount Madison is part of a series of summits named after presidents and other prominent Americans, which is collectively called the Presidential Range.

She was found between Mt Madison and Mt Adams (top right), believed to have died from exposure to the cold

 Plans: Authorities say Matrosova planned to climb all four peaks of the Presidential Range on her own

Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina, hailed from Omsk, Russia, before moving to Chicago to study in 2002

Matrosova's Facebook showed her to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting

According to WMUR-TV, Matrosova was going to venture through Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington after reaching the top of Mount Madison. 

She found between Mount Madison and Mount Adams.

A team made up of Fish and Game officers, Mountain Rescue Services members and Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue members braved 108mph winds and frigid temperatures to reach the area.  

'I guess if you are gonna hike in this type of weather you need to be in a more sheltered area, not up on an open exposed ridgeline,' Goss said. 'There's just no room for error in a place like that.'

It is believed Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina Matrosova, hailed from Omsk in Russia before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. 

She completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Marketing at Chicago's DePaul University in 2006.

Matrosova's first job was with JP Morgan as a financial analyst, before moving to Beach Capital Management where she reached the role of Investment Adviser.

In 2012, she attended Harvard University Extension School to study Numerical Analysis before obtaining a masters in financial engineering from the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business in 2013.

Tribute: This picture was posted on Facebook in tribute to Matrosova with a friend called her 'a vibrant spirit'

After interning for a year at BNP Paribas, she accepted the role of Credit Trading Associate in August 2014.

Based on Facebook pictures, she appeared to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting. Her interests are listed on LinkedIn as mountain climbing, judo and scuba diving.

Friends and relatives paid tribute to Matrosova online, posting pictures of the 32-year-old. 

One wrote: 'Rest in peace...' with a photograph of Matrosova hiking through sunlight snowy woodland.

Another described her as 'a vibrant spirit'.

A blizzard watch was issued for coastal New England over the weekend that touched on the edge of the White Mountain National Forest, which encompasses the Presidential Range.

The region saw up to 14 inches of snow in some areas.
