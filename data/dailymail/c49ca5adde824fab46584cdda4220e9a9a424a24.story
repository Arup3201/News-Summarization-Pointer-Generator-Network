A ferry built in Germany before the start of the war has been put up for sale as a houseboat moored on the River Thames.

The 1939 MS Mouette was delivered to Switzerland just days before World War II, saving the vessel from military involvement, as the country didn't get involved in the conflict.

The 34-metre-long was then used as a ferry for more than 60 years on the land-locked Lac du Neuchatel until Wolfgang Steck came across it in 2004.

The result is a one-bedroom houseboat on the prestigious Cadogan Pier in Chelsea, London, which is now for sale for £695,000.

Wolfgan said: 'When I first saw the MS Mouette, I became fascinated by its history.
