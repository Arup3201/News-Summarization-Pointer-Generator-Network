David Cameron has ruled out George Osborne giving up his political strategy role to focus on being Chancellor.

Despite fierce criticism of Mr Osborne for grim economic figures, the Prime Minister told colleagues that Downing Street and the Treasury working hand in hand was a ‘strength, not a weakness’.

But Lord Ryder, a former Tory chief whip, has claimed both men are ‘obsessed with management of 24-hour news’ and called for there to be a ‘full-time’ Chancellor.

Conservative backbencher Brian Binley 
said he would ‘rather George concentrated on running the economy’ and 
Nadine Dorries, a persistent backbench critic of the party leadership, 
called for Foreign Secretary William Hague to be made Chancellor.

Senior Government sources said the 
idea that Mr Osborne would be moved from the Treasury in a September 
reshuffle was ‘completely absurd’.

Mr Cameron is also determined that the Chancellor should not step back from helping decide political tactics.

‘It is a strength, at a time of 
economic crisis, to have a Chancellor who regularly attends meetings at 
Downing Street,’ said one ally of the Prime Minister.

George doesn’t 
have some second job doing strategy so there is nothing for him to give 
up.

He and David have always been very close, and they work in lockstep,
which is a strength of this Government.

‘Look back to Blair and Brown if you 
want an example of what happens when a prime minister and a chancellor 
work against instead of with each other.’

Mr Cameron is however expected to 
appoint a powerful new party chairman in the autumn, with housing 
minister Grant Shapps favourite to take the job.

The current chairman, Lady Warsi, is 
tipped to be made International Development Secretary or Northern 
Ireland Secretary in the reshuffle.

Vince Cable, who prompted uproar on 
Wednesday night by agreeing he ‘probably would’ make a good replacement 
for Mr Osborne, yesterday denied pushing for the job.

Tipped: Darling of the Tory party William Hague has been touted to take the Chancellor's job should George Osborne go

Vince Cable, who prompted uproar on 
Wednesday night by agreeing he ‘probably would’ make a good replacement 
for Mr Osborne, yesterday denied pushing for the job.

‘We are part of a team, we have a 
collectively agreed policy, and I’m delivering on my bit of it, which 
centres particularly on the area of industrial strategy, and I’m not 
proposing a radically different approach,’ said the Liberal Democrat 
Business Secretary.

‘I would be building on what George 
Osborne has already achieved.’

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, 
meanwhile, also rejected the suggestion he could be in line to take over
as Chancellor.

Lord Ryder, who was John Major’s chief
whip in the 1990s, insisted: ‘He [Osborne] can’t be de facto chairman 
of the Conservative Party and Chancellor at the same time.’

He claimed Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron 
were ‘obsessed with management of 24-hour news, they are news editors, 
news managers, they are no strategists’.

The partnership formed between David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne is a strong one.

Not only are they from privileged backgrounds and former members of Oxford's infamous Bullingdon Club, they have stuck together ever since both reached the ranks of the Tory party.

They are so close they made one another godfathers to each other's children.

Mr Osborne was campaign manager for David Cameron's leadership campaign in 2005.

They have worked side by side ever since.

But in 2009 the Prime Minister was asked if he would sack his friend if things were going badly, despite their firm friendship.

'With George, the answer is yes,' he said, 'He stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are godfathers to each other's children but because he is the right person to do the job. I know and he knows that if that was not the case he would not be there.'

In 2010, when asked again he said: 'Yes. He is a good friend, but we’ve has that conversation a number of times over the past four years. To be fair to George he said "If ever you want to move me to another job, it is your decision and it is your right".'

And following intense pressure from his own party, it appears that Mr Cameron may soon face the toughest decision of all - whether to fire his friend to protect his own career.

‘It is important the Chancellor steps 
away from the immediate picture and tries to build a bigger one,’ he 
added.

‘The Treasury deserves the Chancellor to be there on a full-time 
basis and to ensure it develops a proper economic strategy.’

Following official figures showing the
economy has slumped by another 0.7 per cent, Mr Osborne won a welcome 
boost when the head of the international economic watchdog, the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, gave his 
strategy unequivocal backing.

Angel Gurria, in London for the 
biggest investment conference ever held in the UK, urged Britain to 
persevere with austerity measures that have helped deliver record low 
borrowing costs.

‘You are now sowing the seeds of what 
will be the elements for recovery,’ said the OECD boss.

‘You have to 
have credible public finances before you start moving on growth.’

Mr Osborne, speaking at the event in 
London’s Lancaster House, insisted he had a relentless focus on the 
economy: ‘We’re dealing with our debts, we’re creating the most 
pro-business tax regime in the developed world, and we’re making the 
long-term structural reforms to secure a more productive future.’

At the same conference, Mr Cameron 
vowed to ‘finish the job’ of deficit reduction, despite calls to change 
course in the face of the worst double-dip recession in half a century.

He said there was no question of 
abandoning the ‘tough decisions’ it had made.

‘Be in no doubt,’ he said.
‘We will finish the job.’

The Prime Minister said ministers were
making the reforms needed to make Britain competitive, including 
shaking up the planning system and investing in infrastructure.

But he faced tough questions from 
international business leaders, who voiced concerns that the Coalition’s
immigration cap could be a barrier to recruiting the best staff.

Pledge: Speaking at the British Business Embassy conference in London this morning, Mr Cameron said the Government was trying top drum up business, a day after figures showed the country's economy is in a deeper recession than previously thought

Damning: Since the Coalition took over in Q2 of 2010, GDP, despite encouraging initial figures, has shrunk by 0.3% overall

After a dire day yesterday George Osborne and pressure to resign he has received a welcome boost.

The head of a major international economic organisation, who urged the Chancellor to 'persevere' and 'stay the course'.

The
support came from Angel Gurria, right, secretary general of the Organisation 
for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), who said austerity 
being imposed in Britain  now was 'sowing the seeds of what will be the 
elements for recovery'.

The
OECD chief told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I would say to the 
Chancellor "Stay the course", I would say to the Chancellor that the 
cost of wavering or looking like you are wavering or looking like you 
are weakening your resolve today because of what is happening in the 
markets - because of Spain and Italy and Greece and everything else - is
very high indeed.

'I 
think we have to give very strong signals here, and the Chancellor, the 
Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are all really quite intent
in staying on course and staying on message.

'This
is very important, this is why the UK adjustment programme cleared the 
markets, this is why you have very low borrowing costs, this is why I 
think you should persevere.

'You
are now sowing the seeds of what will be the elements for recovery. You
have to have credible public finances before you start moving on 
growth.'

Mr Gurria, will today meet Mr Osborne at a global investment conference at London’s Lancaster House.

He
rejected suggestions that the Chancellor’s growth schemes had failed, 
saying: 'The programmes need time to produce results... I think we 
should give it time.'

And
he dismissed speculation that the double-dip recession was putting the 
UK’s coveted Triple-A credit rating at risk: 'I don’t think that’s the 
case. References to that were not made by rating agencies.

'I think what the rating agencies are looking for is consistency and coherence and that today is at a very big premium.

'They are the first ones who will turn on you if they see you are not performing.”

Mr Gurria agreed with Mr Osborne’s analysis that UK growth had been held back by the crisis in the eurozone.

'If
the neighbourhood is in such bad shape then predictably, because this 
is a large open economy which is dedicated to exporting, it will have an
impact,' he said.

'You can’t be isolated, you can’t vaccinate yourself against the weakness of your major trading partners.'

But Labour say he is wrong.

Labour Treasury spokeswoman Rachel Reeves said: 'It would be very unwise of George Osborne to take false comfort in the assurances of the head of the OECD. His loyal support for the Government today is the exact opposite of what his deputy has been saying for over a year and what the IMF said last week.'
