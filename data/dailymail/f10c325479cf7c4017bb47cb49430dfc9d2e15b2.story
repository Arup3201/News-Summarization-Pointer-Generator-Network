A mother-of-one lost ten stone and dropped eight dress sizes through being motivated to lose weight by a special ‘hug test’ devised by her ten-year-old daughter.

Dental nurse Genese Ackroyd, 37, of Featherstone, West Yorkshire, went from 22st 3lb to 12st and shrunk from size 26 to size ten, measuring her progress by how easily her daughter Amelia could  place her arms around her as she gave her a hug.

She said: 'I was losing weight for myself, but also my little girl. I wanted her to be proud of me, and I didn’t want her to feel as if she had a fat mum.

'As I kept reaching my milestones, the moment where Amelia could put her arms around me got closer and closer - it was very exciting for both of us.

'The look on her face each time she realised I had made a bit more progress really helped me to keep going.'

Ms Ackroyd started putting on weight rapidly after Amelia, her only child, was born.

She said: 'Amelia was my miracle baby. I’d been told I had polycystic ovaries and conceiving would be difficult, so to have her was a dream come true.

'After she was born and as she grew older I put all my attention on her. I made sure she ate properly and was always healthy, but I let myself slip.

'I was fairly lazy and didn’t have a good understanding of nutrition, so I would feed myself ready meals, takeaways and processed food - anything that was easy to grab.

'Amelia was eating healthy meals but because I was working later hours I would eat separately from her later on.'

By the time she tipped the scales at 22st, Ms Ackroyd began to wonder whether she was doomed to be an unhealthy mum forever.

She said: 'I wanted to lose weight but there were psychological barriers in the way. I thought I would do it when I was good and ready - not when anyone told me to do it The problem was I put that moment off time and time again.'

A health scare in August 2010 proved the shock she needed.

She said: 'I was walking to the car after work when my left leg suddenly went dead. I managed to get home but later than night, when I was in the garden with my friends, I collapsed. My left side went completely numb.

'One of my friends was a nurse and told me to go to hospital straight away.'

She was sent for CT and MRI scans at a stroke unit at Pinderfields Hospital where it was determined that despite suffering from stroke-like symptoms, her brain was not permanently damaged.

She said: 'I was 33, so I was quite young to experience those types of symptoms. I was in hospital for two weeks and wasn’t able to return to work for six weeks. I needed intensive physiotherapy.

'The consultant said my weight played a huge part in what caused the episode. They were clear that if I lost weight, I’d be at less risk of it happening again, or suffering a full stroke.'

Genese now opts for fruit for snacks and eats healthy home cooked meals

After trying to regulate her diet herself for a year, Ms Ackroyd eventually decided to join a slimming club in November 2011.

Within a month she had lost an impressive 11lb, and her daughter Amelia began to measure her progress using her special hug test.

She said: 'It upset Amelia that I wasn’t like all the other mums - that she couldn’t get her arms around me and give me a cuddle, something which seemed so normal for her school friends.

'One day she realised she could bring her fingertips together. Then, she was able to clasp her hands. Then she could get her arms around me. It was a real motivator.

'She also wrote me really encouraging notes which I have come to treasure.'

Before beginning her weight loss journey Ms Ackroyd typically skipped breakfast and ate pastries and cakes like bakewell tarts for lunch before she gorged on unhealthy processed food like chicken nuggets or burgers with chips for an evening meal. She would snack on chocolate and crisps throughout the day.

Today, she eats Weetabix with chopped fruit and milk for breakfast, followed by home-made soup with fruit and yogurt for lunch and slow-cooked chilli or casserole for dinner. When she snacks she always chooses fruit such as apples and pears.

She can now fit into size 10 outfits.

She said: 'I’m the smallest I’ve ever been, and I feel wonderful. Most important of all, I know that Amelia is very proud of me.

'We can do so much more things together. When I was bigger, I didn’t go out with her as much, and I wondered whether that was creating a barrier to us bonding.

'But today I feel so close to her, having shared my achievement with her.

'She’s always coming in close for a cuddle. The first thing she does when she gets home from school is give me a hug.'
