Vivacious spirit: Catherine Gorayeb, pictured, was at a breakfast conference in the North tower of the World Trade Center when the planes struck

A woman whose sister was killed on 9/11 is in court today fighting to adopt the 14-year-old niece she's raised as her own after the girl's biological father gave her up at birth.

Catherine Gorayeb, a single mother after banker Edward Kranz first denied paternity and then gave up custody rights, was attending a breakfast conference in Windows on the World in the North tower when the planes hit and she tragically died after making a panicked call to her brother.

Immediately following her death, Catherine's sister, Claire Gorayeb, who was three-months pregnant herself, uprooted her life as a travel agent in Boston and moved back to her native New York City to raise her two-year-old niece who had suddenly been left motherless.

But in 2004, soon after the young girl, who MailOnline isn't identifying, was awarded $2 million from the 9/11 victims compensation fund, Kranz reappeared in his daughter's life, and has been fighting Gorayeb for custody or at least access since, as she strives to adopt her niece.

After a nine-year court battle, the 
fight will come to a head today with a hearing in Manhattan Surrogate 
Court to determine what is in the best interest of the teenager, 
according to DNAInfo.

Gorayeb,
54, claims Kranz disappeared from his daughter's life for four years 
and should have no say in the adoption he is attempting to scupper.

But
Kranz, 50, of Murray Hill, claims Gorayeb, who has allegedly blocked 
him from seeing the girl, shouldn't be allowed to adopt his daughter.

'[Her] best interests require regular visitation with me, her father,' he says in court papers, according to DNAInfo.

Catherine, who was 41 when she died, was described in a New York 
Times article in December 2002 as a witty and adventurous woman who 
would do anything for those she loved, especially her daughter.

The
successful marketing director fell pregnant after a short-lived fling 
with Kranz, a New York City banker, and decided to go ahead with the 
pregnancy.

After her daughter was born in 
February 1999, Kranz denied he was her father though a court-ordered 
paternity test that September showed a strong probability that he was.

Court papers show that the following January, the former lovers came to an agreement whereby Kranz withdrew any custody and visitation rights in exchange for Catherine giving up on child support. It was four years before he saw or contacted his daughter, the documents state.

When Catherine died, she was living in Battery Park City, close by her parents and within walking distance of her job at Random Walk Computing. And, from accounts, being a single mom suited her just fine.

A woman who worked at her daughter's 
nursery, where Catherine was never late at pick up time, 
said she was known to everyone as 'Bagel Mom' 
because every single morning she arrived armed with fresh bagels from 
the bakery.

'Catherine 
would come in the door and would enthusiastically proclaim "I am the 
bagel mom" and would pass out bagels with (her daughter) to all of the 
children in the classroom,' the woman said.

'She
was very vivacious and had so much energy. Catherine always addressed 
every child in the room by name before taking (her daughter) home. I didn't know Catherine well, but I do know that she loved (her
daughter) to pieces and that (her daughter) loved her.'

But after her death, her sister was quick to assume the 'mommy' role as best she could.

Using cash from the 9/11 compensation fund, Gorayeb rented and later bought an Upper West Side apartment for her niece, her biological daughter and herself to live in.

Around this time she was 
appointed the child's legal guardian and the pair quickly formed a deep bond. According to a Boston Globe article, the then three-year-old interchangeably called Gorayeb 'Claire' and 'mommy.'

In court papers, her lawyer said Gorayeb gave the girl 'a safe, loving and caring home' and paid for summer camp and a private school for both girls as well as taking them to museums.

Kranz reemerged in the family's lives just two weeks after his daughter was rewarded the payout in 2004, the same year he filed for bankruptcy.

He called Gorayeb to say he'd read 
that Catherine had been killed in the terrorist attack after searching 
her name online and weeks later, in February 2004, sent his daughter a 
photo of himself, which is when Gorayeb filed for adoption.

Kranz
later claimed his absence in the child's life was because he was 
waiting for his daughter to turn five before getting in touch.

The
messy court battle began in June that year, when Kranz attempted to get
custody of the girl and reverse Gorayeb's guardianship.

In March 2012, a state court of appeals upheld a decision made earlier by Manhattan Surrogate Court that because Kranz previously had no interest in his daughter his consent wasn't required for the adoption to proceed.

But a judge later took objection to Gorayeb's denying Kranz visitation rights and appointed a guardian who audited the aunt's use of her niece's compensation cash.

Gorayeb had transferred the money to her own bank account and purchased the $900,000 Upper West Side apartment in both her and her niece's names.

This audit further delayed the adoption process and Kranz took the time to petition the court for today's best interest trial.

Claire Gorayeb and her lawyer declined to comment to DNAInfo on the story but in court papers the attorney said: 'At
all times Claire has been ready, willing and able to adopt and has made
every effort to move the adoption forward.'

Kranz and his lawyer also declined to comment to the news website.
