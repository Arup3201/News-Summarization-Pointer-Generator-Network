Glenn Gleeson, who died at the family home in Hertfordshire in May aged 16. An inquest heard today he may have choked on his breakfast after taking morphine pills at a family party the night before 

A teenage boy apparently choked to death on his Weetabix cereal the morning after he took drugs at a family party, an inquest heard today.

Glenn Gleeson had taken morphine pills prescribed as medication for his mother's partner, which were left lying in the house described as 'chaotic'.

The coroner heard that the 16-year-old's breathing failed as he ate his breakfast and resulted in heart failure and his death.

The teenager was found by his half-brother Jamie slumped in a chair in a summerhouse at the family home in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, on the morning of May 5.

Emergency services were called to the scene but were unable to revive Glen and he was declared dead of heart failure.

Police officers then found alcohol, packets of morphine and traces of cannabis around the house, but only morphine was discovered in his system.

At the inquest in Hatfield in Hertfordshire today, the teenager's family and friends wept as coroner Edward Thomas recorded a verdict of misadventure.

He said that Glenn died 'needlessly' and warned of the dangers of leaving any types of drugs around the house.

Members of Glenn's family, including his mother Tracey and her friend Paul Rawlins, Jamie's father, had been drinking at the house the night before his death.

The hearing was told Glenn was the last one to bed but he had not been drinking.

The following morning his half-brother Jamie went out to the summerhouse and found Glenn sat motionless in a chair with a bowl of Weetabix on his lap and some of the cereal around his mouth.

Emergency services were called to the scene shortly before 11.20am while Jamie started CPR, pulling his half-brother out onto the garden grass to do so.

An air ambulance was called, landing in a nearby playing field, but Glenn was declared dead by paramedics at the scene.

At an inquest into his Glenn's death today, Coroner Edward Thomas recorded a verdict of misadventure 

As well as alcohol, packets of morphine prescribed to Mr Rawlins were found around the house. Tests found that Glenn had 53 microgrammes of morphine per 100 millilitres in his blood.

Dr Miriam Mitchison, the consultant pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination, found some food in Glenn's lungs.

However, she said she could not be sure what role this played in the teenager's respiratory failure.

Mr Thomas said: 'If he hadn't had the morphine he wouldn't have been sick. If he hadn't been sick it wouldn't have gone in his lungs. The combination of the two causes acute cardiac failure.

'He did something that was risky and it had an unintended consequence.'

Glenn would have been unable to react to what was happening and felt no pain as he died, almost like he just 'went to sleep', the coroner said.

The inquest held in Hatfield today heard that the 16-year-old may have choked to death while eating Weetabix for his breakfast 

He added: 'Alcohol wasn't a problem for him but the household was all chaotic because of that and things weren't in order.

'When things are chaotic things like tablets are not kept in ordered places. You need to have those things in places you know and places where people won't say, "I will try one of those."

'You don't know the effect of what you're trying. This is a young lad who died needlessly.'

Addressing distraught friends and the family of Glenn, Mr Thomas continued: 'You will miss him for quite some time.

'You may come to terms with his death but it will never be the same.'
