George Osborne today hailed a sharp fall in inflation to its lowest level since May 2000 for helping family incomes go further.

The Chancellor said the economic recovery was now being 'widely felt, after a supermarket price war and falling petrol prices meant the Consumer Price Index rate of inflation fell to its lowest point for almost 15 years.

With wages now rising faster than bills, ministers hailed the news as a 'giant tax cut for the economy' with family incomes now going further each month.

The CPI rate of inflation fell to 0.5 per cent in December, the lowest level since May 2000, according to the Office for National Statistics

The Consumer Prices Index is the measure of the increase in living costs over a year.

It takes into account every aspect of daily life, including housing bills, food, transport and recreation.

Lower inflation means bills are not rising as quickly, and some areas prices are falling.  

In addition to food and petrol bills falling, gas and electricity bills barely rose last month unlike last year when the Big Six came under fire for large price hikes. 

The fall in inflation will ease pressure on household budgets as it boosts real-terms pay as well as pushing further into the future any need to raise interest rates.

Mr Osborne said: 'Today we have welcome news that inflation is at its lowest level in modern times, we have family budgets going further, an economic recovery now being widely felt.'

But he cautioned: 'We've got to remain vigilant that we have low inflation for the right reasons, this is further proof that our long term economic plan is working.'

Prime Minister David Cameron hailed the 'good news' which he said was proof that the government's economic plan was working

The figures will be welcome news for David Cameron and George Osborne, who were seen leaving Downing Street today

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent was 'good news in the short term for British households'.

But acknowledged the dangers that could be posed by it turning negative.

He told the BBC that interest rates were still on course to rise over the next couple of years despite the drop in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure to a record low.

But he said that any rate hikes would be more gradual and more limited than had been expected a year ago.

Mr Carney said: 'By and large these figures are good news in the short term for British households.

'It's largely caused by lower petrol prices and lower food prices. That means your pound is going to stretch farther - lower prices at the pump and in the shops.

'The issue is to make sure that this doesn't become more generalised and that we don't see low and falling prices more generally, because a little bit of inflation is good for the economy, it greases the wheels of the economy.'

The fall below 1 per cent means Bank of England governor Mark Carney has to write to Mr Osborne because it is more than a percentage point off the the Bank's 2 per cent target.

Bank of England policy-makers have said they expected CPI to fall below 1 per cent and remain there for months to come.

It means any rise in interest rates is likely to be delayed, providing a welcome boost to home owners paying off their mortgages. 

But the sharpness of the decline brings the UK uncomfortably close to the scenario in the eurozone, where there are fears of a damaging deflationary spiral after inflation fell to minus 0.2 per cent. 

Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury said: 'These figures show that the falling price of oil is working its way into lower prices. 

'This acts like a giant tax cut for the economy, putting more money in the pockets of hard pressed consumers.' 

The Office for National Statistics said that in 2014 food prices fell by 1.9 per cent and prices of motor fuels fell by 10.5 per cent.

'Historically, these prices have been among the main causes of inflation, though this has changed in the last year,' the ONS said. 

Transport was one of the biggest causes of the fall in inflation, down 0.2 per cent overall between November and December 2014, compared with a rise of 1 per cent between the same two months in 2013.

Almost all of the downward contribution came from the falling price of petrol and diesel, the ONS said. 

Sharp falls in food and transport costs were the biggest drivers in the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent, the ONS said

Latest figures show that wages were up 1.6 per cent in October, well ahead of falling inflation

The average price per litre fell to 116.8p for petrol and 122.9p for diesel, some 24.8p per litre below the peak average prices of in April 2012.

Since December, fuel prices have fallen even further, with petrol now selling for under £1 per litre in sum areas.

James Sproule, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, said: 'This is good news for the vast majority of businesses and households in the UK. 

'Neither the Treasury nor the Bank will be worried by today's figures. In the UK, lower prices driven by a fall in the cost of oil will provide a boost to the economy, and underpin domestic confidence and spending.'
