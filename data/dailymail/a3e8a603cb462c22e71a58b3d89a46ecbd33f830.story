If Cardiff City is little more than a shop window these days, then perhaps someone should consider cleaning the glass. It’s hard to imagine anyone being overly impressed by a trip to watch Russell Slade’s side right now.

This was just a typical day in the recent life of this stumbling club – it started with John Brayford being sold and Kim Bo-Kyung released; it ended with a limp defeat. 

They have won two games in 10 in all competitions and a mediocre Championship campaign is all they have left to cling to after this cup exit.

The greater priority at the moment, it seems, is slashing the wage bill by replacing the players of their past two managers with cheaper, lesser lights. Slade summed it up by saying last week: ‘We are not shopping in Harrods anymore.’

After watching Oliver Norwood and Hal Robson-Kanu striker in the second half to cancel out Kenwyne Jones’s opener, supporters started to leave. It is telling that Slade admitted he wanted to joined them.

He said: ‘It was probably the most disappointing 45 minutes since I have been here. We have had an honest and frank conversation after the game.

‘I would have probably walked out myself if I was in the crowd in that second period. It was dire. There will be ups and downs in terms of making progress but this is a bad day for us. It is important for us to unite, be strong and respond to the criticism.’

For Reading manager Steve Clarke, a cup winner as a player and coach at Chelsea, this was an altogether more enjoyable trip to Cardiff than last season, when a 1-0 defeat cost him his West Brom job. 

He said: ‘It feels better this time. We tweaked the mentality at half-time went on the front foot and deserved to win.

‘We just had a quiet chat to put one or two things right. We reminded them of their responsibilities when they cross the line and play for those fans.’

Clarke made only two changes to the side that lost against Fulham in the Championship, but even with a strong side they barely made a dent in the first half.

Norwood curled over after 11 minutes and Gareth McCleary cut in from the right moments later before hitting a bouncing shot straight at Simon Moore. Neither moment was particularly threatening. 

Cardiff were no better. Having gone from functional under Malky Mackay to attacking under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, they are back where they started, just not nearly so effective. Certainly, the transitions and overhauls have been costly in a number of senses.

The momentum for this club seems distinctly negative, though they at least had a lead to shout about in this fixture.

As has so often been the case, it was Kenwyne Jones, the club’s biggest earner but also their leading threat, who did the damage. Peter Whittingham hooked in a corner from the left and the Trinidadian’s header was excellent. 

He has six goals in eight games and 12 for the season – the club’s fortunes would be bleaker if he, too, is erased from the balance sheet.

But a single cog can only do so much. Cardiff had a man less in midfield and the pressure built until Norwood levelled in the 64th minute with a free-kick. Hal Robson-Kanu came off the bench and immediately forced a good save before he flicked the winner two minutes from time.

Reading’s upward curve under Clarke continued; a strange season for Cardiff just got a little bit worse.
