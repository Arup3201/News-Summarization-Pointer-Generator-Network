Terry Admas, former head of an infamous crime family, has lost a High Court battle after a judge has rejected his claims he was too poor to pay back debts from his days of crime

The head of an infamous crime family has lost a High Court battle after a judge rejected his claims he was 'poncing off his wife' and was too poor to pay back debts from his days of crime.

Terry Adams, the former boss of the north London Adams Family gang, argued he was too poor to meet a £650,000-plus debt.

He told Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, sitting in London, that he was so poor that he felt 'like a ponce' living off his actress wife Ruth.

He also denied having hidden assets that were funding a luxury lifestyle.

Mrs Adams recently appeared in Fings Ain’t Wot They Used T’Be at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East.

Adams applied to the judge for a 'certificate of inadequacy' to show that he lacked funds to meet his crime-linked debts - a preliminary step to getting them reduced or written off.

But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) opposed his application and said there was 'a strong case' that Adams possessed 'substantial undisclosed assets' that continued to fund a luxury lifestyle.

The CPS told 
the High Court that Mr and Mrs Adams’ average 'identifiable' spending in
 the three years from September 2010-2013 was £97,000 per annum - 
'nearly four times the national average'.

The
 CPS said the type of spending was 'inconsistent' with her husband’s 
claim of having no assets and of being reliant on friends and family 
loans for living expenses.

The
 CPS gave as examples Mrs Adams spending £12,044 on dental treatment and
 £2,500 on a dietary programme during three months in 2013.

In June 2010 she bought a spa membership at a North London country club for £3,850.

The couple also spent nearly £15,000 on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment from August 2009 to September 2013.

Another £5,351 had gone on parking charges, fines, and the congestion charge.

Dismissing
 his application for a certificate, the judge said she was 'not 
satisfied that Terry Adams has provided full and frank disclosure to the
 court' of the assets 'which fund his life and that of his wife'.

Judge Davies refused Adams permission to appeal against her decision.

Adams
 owes the balance of a confiscation order of £750,000 imposed after his 
conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2007 for conspiring to conceal 
the proceeds of criminal conduct over a six-year period.

The
 trial judge said he had accumulated a 'considerable fortune' from his 
life as 'a highly successful career criminal' over a 'significant' 
period of time.

He told Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, sitting in London, that he was so poor that he felt 'like a ponce' living off his actress wife Ruth Adams (pictured at an earlier hearing)

Described in the courts as once heading one of the most feared organised criminal gangs in the UK, he was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £50,000 and the £4.6 million bill for his publicly funded defence.

Today the High Court rejected his claim that he was too poor to pay up on the confiscation order. The judge said that, when she heard his application at a three-day hearing in July, the amount outstanding on the order was £651,611, and interest was accruing at the rate of £83 a day.

Dismissing his plea for a certificate of inadequacy, she said: 'I believe that there are financial matters known peculiarly to Terence Adams which are not before the court.

'Upon the evidence presented to the court on behalf of the applicant, I am not satisfied that the current assets of Terence Adams are worth less than the outstanding balance of the confiscation order. Accordingly this application is refused.'

Barrister Ivan Krolick said on Adams’ behalf that he could not meet the confiscation order and added: 'He has committed crime and paid his price to society.'

Mr Krolick said Adams became bitter after MI5 bugged his former London home for almost two years, recording the most intimate moments of his private life, including the sounds of him making love with his wife.

Mr Krolick told the judge: 'You may have felt that Mr Adams is a somewhat bitter man. Rightly or wrongly, to put up with, or learn that, everything you said to your family and friends has been pored over by the authorities must make a person bitter.

Dismissing his application for a certificate, the judge said she was 'not satisfied that Terry Adams has provided full and frank disclosure to the court' of the assets 'which fund his life and that of his wife'

'This is a man who has been living in a goldfish bowl. There is no element of his life that has not been exposed to the authorities.'

He rejected accusations that Mrs Adams had been involved in the staging of sham loans.

He suggested the CPS case was 'guesswork' and Adams’ claim of poverty was genuine.

After today’s ruling, the CPS said the order against Adams, with interest, was 'now worth £653,947.74' - and steps would be taken to ensure that he met the debt and to show 'crime doesn’t pay'.

The CPS said that, following the sale of his home in north London in 2009, Adams paid the court £234,166.21 and another £130,323.43 following the sale of other assets.

In seeking to have the confiscation order reduced, it was Adams’s case that his current assets were worth less than the outstanding balance of the confiscation order.

The CPS said: 'He claimed that he and his wife were living on expenses of £200 per week, paying rent of £250 and living on £23,000 - £24,000 per annum.

'However, visits to the Royal Opera House and expensive meals out, spa memberships at luxurious hotels, high cost dental treatments and other treatments at private clinics all indicated a very different lifestyle.'

Nick Price, head of the CPS Proceeds of Crime department, said: 'Through a series of nefarious means, Terry Adams has consistently sought to hide the proceeds of his crimes.

'However, today’s judgment is proof of our determination to see that crime doesn’t pay and that those who seek to hide their wealth will be challenged and held to account.

'Mr Adams argued that he couldn’t afford to pay what he owed and yet his lavish lifestyle showed this was not the case.

'I’m pleased that, presented with our carefully gathered evidence, the judge has decided that Mr Adams does, in fact, have the ability to pay and has assets that he has not put before the court.

'We will now work hard to ensure that Mr Adams pays his confiscation order.'

Mr Price said many criminals 'go to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying what is owed under confiscation orders, such as applying to the High Court to write off debt and hiding their assets.

'Depriving criminals of their ill-gotten gains disrupts organised crime and the new CPS National Proceeds of Crime Service is leading this fight across the country.

'Dedicated prosecutors will work tirelessly with investigators to claw back assets from those who seek to benefit from their crimes.'

Head of the National Crime Agency’s Centurion Team, Mark Blackwell, said: 'Today’s judgment shows the real value of lifetime management and especially ancillary orders such as financial reporting orders (FROs).

'Terry Adams’ FRO remains in force until 2017 and his confiscation order will continue to incur interest until it is settled. The NCA, in partnership with the CPS, will monitor both these orders very closely.'
