IBM and Boston authorities tested a new facial recognition software that secretly scanned every person who attended two major music festivals in Boston - all without their knowledge or consent, according to a Boston newspaper. 

The massive surveillance system, run by the company's Intelligence Operations Center, aimed cameras on thousands of people at Boston Calling, a massive  concert series near City Hall, in May and September 2013.

The first test run took place a month after  bombings that killed three people and injured dozens more near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

According to the newspaper Dig Boston,  Boston police officers were on hand to witness the test of the surveillance system - though IBM staffers were running the operation. 

These images, purportedly taken from an IBM report on surveillance operations at the Boston Calling music festival, show how people were scanned at the event

Dig Boston reports that the program scanned to determine 'skin tone,' 'head color' and clothing texture of attendees, with the goal of running everyone at the event through the software

The example of surveillance camera footage shows how the IBM software was able to flag all black women wearing glasses and yellow shirts who went through mass transit turnstiles. It is not clear whether this was part of the Boston Calling surveillance activity

Dig Boston claims that the test sought to track 'every person' at the musical festival with ten surveillance cameras that had been set up around the event.

The newspaper says it uncovered documents detailing the use of IBM's Face Capture software, which identifies 'baldness,' 'head color,' 'skin tone' and clothing.

IBM says Face Capture was not used at the event.

IBM spokeswoman Holli Haswell told MailOnline: 'IBM shared a one-time proof of concept and demo with the City of Boston on situational analytics. In the demo, IBM provided broad analytics for several use cases such as identifying suspicious objects like an abandoned bag or vehicle, or to provide an alert when someone crosses from an unrestricted area to a restricted area.

'The software did not provide facial recognition on attendees at Boston Calling.' 

Earlier this month, Dig Boston found an IBM report detailing the operation that had been available online for more than a year. 

A spokeswoman for the mayor's office acknowledged that Boston officials had authorized the test - though later scrapped the project. 

Both the mayor's office and the police say they do not currently operate surveillance technology like IBM tested at Boston Calling. 

'The City of Boston engaged in a pilot program with IBM, testing situational awareness software for two events hosted on City Hall Plaza: Boston Calling in May 2013, and Boston Calling in September 2013,' Kate Norton, the spokeswoman for Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, told Dig Boston. 

'The purpose of the pilot was to evaluate software that could make it easier for the City to host large, public events, looking at challenges such as permitting, basic services, crowd and traffic management, public safety, and citizen engagement through social media and other channels.

'These were technology demonstrations utilizing pre-existing hardware (cameras) and data storage systems.' 

IBM did not respond to a request for comment. 

Although IBM scanned thousands of people during the test, there's no indication that the company tried to put names to the faces it collected. 

Boston Police spokesman Sergeant Michael McCarthy told MailOnline that the company did not have access to Boston police booking photos or driver license pictures.
