Centrica chairman Rick Haythornthwaite said criticism of prices and profits is stopping firms commissioning the power stations the country needs

British Gas bosses triggered anger yesterday after warning that the lights will go out if politicians and families continue to attack energy price rises and profits.

Parent company Centrica’s chairman raised the prospect of blackouts within two years unless there is an end to ‘hostilities’.

Consumer groups and MPs insisted the public would not be threatened into falling silent as they struggle to cover the cost of heat and light.

The row came as Centrica revealed profits of £2.7billion for 2013, down 2 per cent on the year before. British Gas, the nation’s biggest energy supplier with some 15.2million accounts, made a £571million profit, a fall of 6 per cent.

It came against an exodus of 460,000 customers after the company put up prices by an average of 9.2 per cent in November, taking the annual average bill close to £1,500.

Executives are furious that both David Cameron and Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey actively encouraged families to switch to cheaper rivals.

Mr Davey has also suggested that some British Gas profit margins are too high and the company may have to be broken up.

Labour is threatening a 20 month price freeze if it wins the 2015 General Election, which would be a hammer blow to income and profits.

British Gas and the other ‘big six’ suppliers came under fire for putting up prices ahead of the winter, turning the screw on customers suffering a five-year cost of living squeeze.

But Centrica chairman Rick Haythornthwaite said criticism of prices and profits is stopping firms commissioning the power stations the country needs.

‘I think it is immensely damaging, not just for Centrica, but for the nation,’ Mr Haythornthwaite said.

‘I think the reputation of Britain as a place in which to invest is under threat and the time to correct that is now, not after the 2015 election, by which time the possibility of the lights going out in Britain will be looming much larger.

‘And I don’t see this as the figment of a scaremonger’s imagination. I think right now we’ve got to restart collaborative, constructive dialogue around these key issues. We cannot afford to wait. Hostilities have got to cease.’

Oxford-educated Mr Haythornthwaite, 56, has earned the name ‘Slick Rick’ in City circles from his time in senior roles at businesses including BP and Mastercard. At Network Rail, where he was chairman, he was criticised for allegedly presiding over a ‘gravy train’ of executive pay excess.

The National Pensioners Convention said energy consumers would not be threatened or pressured into keeping quiet about profits and prices.

Spokesman Neil Duncan-Jordan said: ‘Consumers will only stop criticising and complaining about the big six energy companies when they start to treat customers fairly, rather than seeing us as a cash cow.’

Labour MP John Robertson, a member of the Commons Energy Select Committee, described Mr Haythornthwaite’s comments as ‘ridiculous’. He said: ‘We need to keep shining the spotlight on well-above inflation price rises and the raking in of millions in profits.’

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said the fact that British Gas was still making healthy profits despite customers leaving was further evidence the energy market is broken.Centrica bosses argue that the decision by politicians from all parties to target British Gas is unfair.

The firm’s shares have plunged by more than a fifth since Labour’s price freeze pledge in the autumn, with the stock driven down further by suggestions the business could be broken up.

Wholesale gas prices have fallen in recent months, but Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw said it was too early to say what will happen to bills.

He even suggested the criticism from politicians means energy firms have to pay more to attract the best executives.
