Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has hailed the impact of Old Trafford debutants during the 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

Herrera, also a summer signing for United, particularly praised man of the match Angel di Maria after his stunning performance guided Louis van Gaal's side to their first win this season.

Di Maria, the club's £60million record signing, scored the opening goal after his free-kick evaded everyone, before aiding goals for Herrera, captain Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata during the comprehensive win.

'Angel (di Maria) is one of the best players in the world. Manchester United always has to have top players and he is one of the best,' Herrera told MUTV after the victory.

Fellow summer acquisitions Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao also took their first-team bows and Herrera insists the future is promising for the squad.

'I think they played very good football, they had some very good passes and always kept the ball.

'We have Radamel Falcao as well, with Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Luke Shaw. I think we have a new team but we are improving, we are working hard and we are looking forward to this season,' added Herrera. 

'Marcos is very, very aggressive and this is important for the team. Blind never loses the ball and we are happy, but of course we have to improve still.'

Herrera was delighted to score his first goal for United with an accurate strike after 36 minutes on the edge of the area.

'I am happy, of course,' said Herrera. 'It is important to make a goal at Old Trafford, one of the best stadiums in the world. I am happy for my goal but I am happier because we won.

'I wish it can be our first step and I am sure is it. The next games are very important because we want to be as soon as possible at the top of the league.'
