The Premier League's big hitters have been handed a major boost in their quest to secure a deal for 18-year-old attacking midfielder Zakaria Bakkali.

Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool are among the clubs to have been put on alert after the Belgian wonderkid's contract negotiations with PSV Eindhoven recently broke down. The likes of Arsenal and Tottenham are also reported to be tracking the youngster.

Bakkali is regarded as one of the finest young stars in Europe, and has attracted interest from many of the major clubs around the continent after exploding on to the scene last year in Holland.

Standing at under 5ft 5in tall, Bakkali has been compared to Sergio Aguero for bustling running and sharp shooting.

He is extremely quick and possesses rapid acceleration as well as close ball control skills. He likes to run at players, cut in from the wings, and strike with either foot. 

Having impressed at various age levels he burst to prominence with a hat-trick against NEC in August last season aged just 17 years and 196 days. It made him the youngest player to achieve the feat in the history of the Dutch top-flight.

He then went on to make his international debut for Belgium as a second-half substitute in their World Cup qualifier against Wales last October.

Whilst PSV are hopeful of keeping the talented youngster, Bakkali has just 12 months remaining on his current deal, and is reportedly keen to move on either in January or next summer.

And the Dutch club could be forced to cash in now rather than face the prospect of losing him for nothing at the end of the season. 

PSV sporting director Marcel Brands has spoken of his disappointment at the prospect of losing Bakkali. 

'Of course it's bad for the club,' he said.

'But I think it's actually worse for the player himself. It is a shame that a young player with talent does not choose the right path.

'People might think I am naive but I don't blame the guy or his father.

'The problem is that Zakaria is getting influenced by everything and everyone around him.'
