An estate agent has hired bouncers to keep out protesters demonstrating against the gentrification of their neighbourhood.

Foxtons in Brixton, South London, has been the target of local residents worried about high rents and excessive agents' fees.

And when activists tried to talk to staff at the branch, they responded by hiring private security guards to keep the demonstrators away.

The estate agent opened its branch in Brixton in March.

It was immediately targeted by vandals, who defaced its windows with messages directed against Foxtons clients.

Employees found that abusive graffiti reading 'yuck' and 'yuppies out!' had been painted over the storefront.

Last Saturday, campaigners visited three local estate agents to demonstrate against rent hikes and discuss the fees they charge.

While one business welcomed the activists, Foxtons responded by posting guards outside the entrance and denying the campaigners entrance.

The bouncers said that no one was available to talk to the residents about their concerns.

The protesters presented a satirical award to the business, dubbing Foxtons 'Brixton's worst letting agent' and accusing them of 'high fees, high rents, cowardly behaviour, and services to gentrification'.

'Despite the dismal state of our economy and the relentless cuts, rents keep rocketing up and letting agents are making things worse,' campaigner Daniel Oldfield told Brixton Blog.

'They often actively advise landlords to put up rents and charge all kinds of fees, most of which have only emerged in the last few years in the so called "competitive" marketplace.'

Brixton has long been known as a highly multicultural area, having been a major centre of immigration from the Caribbean.

Although it was formerly one of London's poorest neighbourhoods, it has received an influx of young professionals in recent years, and new businesses such as cafes, art galleries and delicatessens have sprung up to cater to them.

Foxtons is considered a yuppie icon thanks to its modernistic decor, fleet of branded Minis and deliberately informal atmosphere.
