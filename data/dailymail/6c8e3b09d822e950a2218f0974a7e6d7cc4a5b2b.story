For some football fanatics it seems a mere autograph just isn't enough any more.

And when this obsessed fan asked Green Bay Packers star A.J. Hawk to tackle him during a celebrity golf tournament the 6ft 1ins, 235lb linebacker seemed only too happy to oblige.

The fan, who perhaps had sunk one too many cold beers, was filmed standing on the course pretending to receive a pass before Hawk slammed him to the floor with a trademark body blow.

Fortunately the fan, who was not wearing any pads, appeared unhurt and the pair embraced before Hawk continued his round at the American Century Championship Pro-Am golf tournament at South Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

Video if the incident has gone viral on the internet after being posted on the
 official American Century Instagram account.

A tackle from Hawk is normally no laughing matter. Last season the 30-year-old NFL veteran made 118 and has either led the team or finished second in tackles for six of his seven seasons in Green Bay.

It is not the first time Hawk has tackled a fan at a celebrity golf tournament.

In 2012 he knocked a man into a pond at the Inspiring Minds Celebrity Golf Outing. It later transpired the man had actually paid for the privilege at a charity auction the night before.

Speaking about the 2012 incident: Hawk told NFL.com: 'It was a charity golf event up in Youngstown and at the end, they have a dinner and auction and stuff.

Incredibly the fan had paid good money at a charity auction to be slammed into the pond by the Green Bay Packers star

'The guy that was running the auction, I knew him, and he wanted to raise some more money. So that was his auction item [the touch football game].

'He paid good money to have [it]. ... Troy Smith threw the ball to him. Then I tackled him into the water.

'The dude paid — the guy's name is Bill — he paid good money to have that happen. ... The only thing I regret is...I wish I would've wrapped him up and tackled him into the water. That would've been awesome.'
