Obama said the wreath-laying is a gesture to 'remember every service member who has ever worn our nation's uniform.'

He said in a speech at the cemetery's

by its veterans and their families.

He also says that 'no ceremony or 
parade, no hug or handshake is enough to truly honor that service.' 
Obama says the country must commit every day 'to serving you as well as 
you've served us.'

Earlier, the Obamas and Bidens held a breakfast with veterans at the White House.

This year, Veterans Day falls on a Sunday, and the federal observance is on Monday.

It's the first such day honoring the men and women who served in uniform since the last U.S. troops left Iraq in December 2011.

It's
also a chance to thank those who stormed the beaches during World War 
II - a population that is rapidly shrinking with most of those former 
troops now in their 80s and 90s.

At
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, a steady stream of 
visitors arrived Saturday morning as the names of the 58,000 people on 
the wall were being read over a loudspeaker.

several snow globes with an American eagle inside.

They then spread out to plant 56,000 flags amid the cemetery's flat gravestones, transforming the green landscape into a sea of fluttering red, white and blue.

Until last year, the cemetery did not permit flags or flag holders on graves.

That changed under pressure from Paul Monti of Raynham, Mass., whose son, Sgt. 1st Class Jared Monti, was killed by Taliban fighters while trying to save a fellow soldier in 2006 in Afghanistan.

He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his valor and is buried at the Bourne cemetery.

A few hundred people attended a Veterans Day parade Saturday in downtown Atlanta.

Veterans Ronald McLendon, 73, of Kennesaw, and Randy Bergman, 59, of Cartersville, were working as parade marshals.

McLendon said when he returned from Vietnam, he was spit on by protesters in San Francisco. He was in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was deployed to Vietnam from 1967 to 1968.

He described the parade as a chance to receive a public thank you.

‘You've got to remember that today everyone in the military is strictly volunteer,’ McLendon said. ‘So there's a lot of guys getting out there, getting shot in Iraq and Afghanistan that volunteered to be in the military.’

He was unsure how and whether the U.S. should end its military involvement in Afghanistan.

‘How many lives have we already put over there? And are we going to pull out and say, 'We lost.' I look back to Vietnam and see the same thing,’ he said.
