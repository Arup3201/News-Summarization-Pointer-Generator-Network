Guessing the royal baby’s name has quickly become one of the nation’s favourite pastimes.

George and James became the favourites at the bookies last night, after hundreds of thousands of pounds were staked on the possibilities.

Alexander, Henry, Louis, Richard and Arthur were the next most betted-on choices.

Anonymous: But the British public are speculating over the name of the future King, pictured

Happy couple: It is not yet known what Kate and William will choose to call their firstborn son

The name will likely come to symbolise an entire era - as in Georgian, Victorian and Elizabethan.

Yesterday, mug and tea-towel makers were poised to go into production the moment the name is announced.

It is also likely that unofficial Twitter accounts, Facebook pages and even ‘.com’ internet addresses bearing the baby’s name will spring up immediately.

The waiting game could go on for some time. When Prince William arrived in 1982, his parents took seven days to decide what to call him.

Princess Diana was thought to have argued for Sebastian and Oliver, while Charles reportedly had his heart set on Albert or Arthur.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have 42 days to register their son’s birth, but are unlikely to take that long.

Charles Kidd, editor of Debrett’s Peerage and Baronetage, said: ‘I think the Royal Family quite like to do things slowly.

‘It’s quite dignified to have a bit of breathing space between the birth and the announcement of the name. It’s a measured approach.

‘But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge seem very organised. I would be surprised if it took them longer than a week.’

Royals: The baby is likely to be given a traditional name, but will probably not be named after his grandfather Charles

Grandparents: But Carole Middleton insisted that she and Michael had not given advice on the name

Edward and Charles are seen as unlikely first names, but could be suitable as middle names. So could Michael, should Kate wish to honour her father.

Another possible middle name is Francis, a recurring moniker in Kate’s family tree.

It is both her father and her grandfather’s middle name and Frances was her great-great-great grandmother’s first name. It was also Princess Diana’s middle name, meaning William could honour his mother’s memory through his son if he chose its masculine form.

The Queen will be informed of the chosen names prior to their announcement, but is unlikely to wield a veto. 

Odds: Bookmakers have been taking bets on the name of the royal baby for several months

Announcement: The birth of the new Prince was officially announced on an easel outside Buckingham Palace

Royal writer Christopher Warwick said: ‘The Queen is so down to earth that she’s not likely to jump up and down and say this boy has got to be called Charles and George.

‘This isn’t going to be, “Granny, do you approve?” but more “These are the names we’ve chosen - do you like them?”

‘It’s much more of a personal thing these days.’

Great-great-grandfather: The last king called George was George VI, the current Queen's father

1) George (7/4)

Meaning: ‘Farmer / earth worker’

George is a popular modern choice, and there have been six previous reigning Georges.

For this reason, the name George would be seen as a ‘safe’ choice, symbolising the continuity of the monarchy.

It was the Sovereign name of the Queen’s beloved father, George VI, and is also one of Prince Charles’s middle names.

Even King Edward VIII - who abdicated the throne - had George among his seven names.

But there are also reasons for thinking the bookies’ favourite may not be the royals’ first choice.

Nottingham Trent University social historian Dr Judith Rowbotham speculated: ‘Royal advisers are likely to point out that the 19th century Prince George of Cambridge was not exactly a model that Kate and William would wish the new prince to emulate.

‘He was not popular with his cousin Queen Victoria, especially after he married an actress who was the mother of four children by three different fathers.’

In the BBC television comedy Blackadder, Prince George was a childish, spoiled, bumbling foppish fool who spent money extravagantly.

Precedent: King James I was also James VI of Scotland and could provide inspiration

2) James (4/1)

Meaning: ‘He who supplants’

The name James has strong royal ties, with two English kings bearing the name.

It was also the name of six Scottish kings, so could prove popular north of the border - something to bear in mind as the Scottish independence debate rages.

But William already has a cousin called James - the Earl and Countess of Wessex’s son Viscount Severn - and it is the name of his brother-in-law.

Kate, who is close to her brother James, may feel that having one in the family is enough.

3) Alexander (7/1 or 8/1)

Meaning: ‘Protector of men’

This would be another one popular in Scotland, where Alexander III was regarded as one of the country’s greatest rulers.

A Prince Alexander would inevitably be nicknamed Alexander the Great after the ancient Greek legend.

In April this year, Willem-Alexander was sworn in as King of the Netherlands after the abdication of his mother, Queen Beatrix.

Consolation prize? The baby could be named after his uncle, Prince Harry

4) Henry (12/1)

Meaning: ‘Rules his household’

A flurry of last-minute bets slashed the odds on Henry from 50/1 at Ladbrokes in the 48 hours leading up to the birth.

It is Prince Harry’s full first name, and would pay a brotherly homage to William’s best man - plus serve as a consolation prize after the newborn pushed Harry into fourth place in the line of succession.

England’s most famous Henry was King Henry VIII, who married six times and set up the Church of England to split from the Roman Catholic Church.

5) Louis (12/1)

Meaning: ‘Famous warrior’

This name has deep significance in the Windsor family in honour of the Prince of Wales’s favourite uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was killed by the IRA in 1979. Louis is the last of William’s three middle names.
