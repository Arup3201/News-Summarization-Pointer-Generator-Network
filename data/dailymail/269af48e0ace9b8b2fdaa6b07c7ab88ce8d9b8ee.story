The Princess Royal, the Duke of Cambridge, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh took part in the Knights of the Thistle Service at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh today.

And despite temperatures reaching a scorching 28C across the UK today, the royal party appeared in the traditional dark green velvet floor length robes, for the service.

Thousands of people lined the Royal Mile
 outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the Royal Family as they 
entered the cathedral to a fanfare from Her Majesty's Household 
Trumpeters in Scotland.

Dressed in full traditional regalia, Prince William looked worlds away from the relaxed and laid back father we have become used to seeing

Both Princess Anne and Prince William, who is known as the Earl of Strathearn in Scotland, have been invested in the Order of the Thistle in 2001 and 2012 respectively

The mood was sombre, marking the serious nature of the service, which appoints people the highest honour in Scotland

The Queen wore a white brocade dress under her splendid green velvet mantle

Wearing a brocade white dress under her regalia the Queen looked contemplative as she walked alongside members of her family.

So cumbersome was her long mantle, a page boy, dressed in bright green, was enlisted to help hold it up at times.

The monarch, 88, was joined by her husband Prince Phillip, who looked to be in fine form following recent spells of ill health.

A sombre Prince William embraced his royal duties, leaving wife Kate and baby George at home for the day.

In his traditional feathered hat and dripping with symbolic embellishments, chains and rich gold tassels, the young royal was a world away from the more relaxed, casual William the public have become used to seeing since he became a father last year. 

The Queen and Prince Phillip have been staying in Scotland this week, attending various official engagements
