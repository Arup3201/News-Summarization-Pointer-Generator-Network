Ukip has accused Channel 4 of peddling 'liberal-Left poppycock' over an apocalyptic portrayal of what British life would be like if Nigel Farage became Prime Minister.

The row has blown up over a drama-documentary to be screened at tomorrow which imagines life under a Farage government. In Ukip: The First Hundred Days – which mixes acted scenes with real news footage – border guards are seen forcibly repatriating illegal immigrants amid race riots, as the UK prepares to pull out of the European Union.

The film shows Ukip winning a slim majority in May's Election, but within three months, society is on the brink of collapse under Mr Farage's Right-wing policies.

Panic: Ukip has hit back at Channel 4's new drama-documentary which shows British society on the brink of collapse, three months after Ukip (leader Nigel Farage pictured) wins the 2015 general election

Weaved into the plot are references to some of the many racism and sexism scandals which have hit the party in recent years.

Last night, one aide close to the Ukip leader hit back, telling The Mail on Sunday: 'This is typical of the poppycock peddled by the public-school educated Lefties who run Channel 4 and large chunks of the media.

'The idea that this is what would happen is simply preposterous, but it shows that we have got the liberal establishment quaking.

'Bring it on, we say, because this sort of thing simply serves to boost our ratings.'

The film is seen from the perspective of a fictional Ukip MP, Deepa Kaur, the only female Asian in the Parliamentary Party, who is asked to defend policies such as raids on businesses suspected of harbouring immigrants.

Kaur, played by Priyanga Burford, is tipped for a Cabinet post but faces furious demonstrations when the largest employer in her constituency is put out of business by Farage's decision to pull Britain out of the EU.

She then decides she has been 'used' by Farage, and condemns the raids as 'aggressive and un-British'.

Disaster: A scene from new docu-drama 'Ukip: The First 100 Days' (pictured) suggests a UKIP government would lead to riots in the streets and the loss of millions of jobs after the UK leaves the EU

Fantasy: A scene from the drama. Many scenes play out in a post-cigarette-ban world of smoky pubs

The provocative scenes play out against the backdrop of smoky pubs because Farage has lifted the smoking ban.

Archive footage is used to portray Mr Farage, his Deputy Prime Minister – former Tory MP Neil Hamilton – and Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom, who is seen repeating his infamous remark about Africa being 'bongo bongo land'.

Mr Farage was initially invited to discuss the scenario in a Channel 4 interview with Jeremy Paxman, but negotiations broke down.

Nick Mirsky, Channel 4's head of documentaries, denied that the film, which airs ay 9pm, was 'anti-Ukip', but admitted that it did not have to be 'politically balanced' because was being shown outside of the official Election campaign period, which starts on March 30.

He said: 'Our job is to reflect and explore contemporary British life. Nothing represents what's different and unique in British political life now more than the rise of Ukip.

'This might be what you wake up to after May 7.'
