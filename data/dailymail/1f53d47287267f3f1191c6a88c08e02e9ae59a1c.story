A student who was critically wounded at Columbine High School nearly 13 years ago is now facing foreclosure on his home.

Richard Castaldo was only 17 years old during the horrific massacre, and was one of the first shot on the morning of April 20, 1999, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.

Now, the 31-year-old survivor is in a bitter dispute to keep his condominium in Southern California, and has turned to an unlikely place - the Occupy Los Angeles movement - for help.

A student who was critically wounded at Columbine High School nearly 13 years ago is now facing foreclosure on his home.
Dispute: Richard Castaldo, 31, was shot and paralyzed from the chest down during the horrific Columbine massacre on the morning of April 20, 1999. Now, he's in a bitter dispute to keep his condominium in Southern California

Confined: Mr Castaldo is now confined to a wheelchair

Injury: Mr Castaldo was hit with eight separate bullets, one of which lodged in his spine shown here

Around 11:20am that morning, Mr Castaldo and his friend Rachel Scott were sitting outside of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado eating lunch together near the west entrance of the school when two of their fellow students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, opened fire on them.

Mr Castaldo was hit with eight separate bullets, one of which lodged in his spine, paralyzing him from the chest down.

Ms Scott was shot four times, once in the head, and died instantly.

In total, 12 students and one teacher were killed in the Columbine shootings, and 21 students – including Mr Castaldo – were injured.

Both Harris and Klebold committed suicide following the shootings.

The family of Mr Castaldo filed lawsuits in August of 2000 against the parents of Harris and Klebold as well as those who sold guns to the killers. The families of several other victims were also part of the lawsuit.

Loss: On the morning of the Columbine shootings, Mr Castaldo and his friend Rachel Scott (pictured) were sitting outside of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado eating lunch together near the west entrance of the school when two of their fellow students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, opened fire on them

Mourning: Ms Scott was shot four times, once in the head, and died instantly

Aftermath: In total, 12 students and one teacher were killed in the Columbine shootings, and 21 students ¿ including Mr Castaldo ¿ were injured

After a bitter legal dispute lasting more than a year, Mr Castaldo and around 30 other victims' families received a collective $2.85million settlement.

It remains unclear how much of that settlement Mr Castaldo and his family received.

Survivor: Mr Castaldo is all smiles as he listened to President Bill Clinton make a speech during a groundbreaking ceremony in Clement Park not far from Columbine High School in 2006

The massacre survivor moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music after a lengthy stay at the hospital, according to NBC Los Angeles. During his recovery, he even received a phone call from then-president Bill Clinton wishing him a speedy recovery.

Mr Castaldo purchased a condo at the Hollywood Regis in 2008, thinking the Southern California property to be a wise investment.

But as was the case for millions of other Americans lured into the housing bubble, the value depreciated, and Mr Castaldo was in serious financial trouble. He started to fall behind on payments in February.

‘I feel kind of stupid, honestly, because I should have known better,’ he told NBC Los Angeles.

He told the news station that though he received offers to help, every solicitor demanded that the money be paid up front.

Mr Castaldo was running out of options, with his foreclosed condo is up for auction next month.

And so, the Columbine survivor turned to an unlikely source – Occupy Los Angeles, part of the greater Occupy movement – for help.

‘I feel like they’re really the only group that doesn’t have an ulterior motive,’ he said of the group, which was itself evicted from Los Angeles’ City Hall.

Discharged: Mr Castaldo, then 17, was the last victim of the massacre at Columbine High School. Here he's all smiles on the day he's discharged from the hospital

The organization is guiding him 
through what can be a minefield of legal jargon, focusing on Mr 
Castaldo’s rights as a homeowner.

Whatever
 happens with his home, the Southern California resident has no plans to
 return to Colorado, citing both the Columbine massacre and the deadly 
movie theater shooting in nearby Aurora this past July.

Occupy
 LA’s declaration says that one of its main principles is to ‘protect 
their own rights, and those of their neighbors’ if and when the system 
fails them.

Mr Castaldo also has legal representation from Brookstone Law Group, which is working pro bono on his case.

Slaughter: Mr Harris and Mr Klebold are seen here on video tape around 11:20am the morning of the Columbine shootings

Suicide: The Columbine gunmen, shown here in the 1998 school yearbook, both committed suicide following the shootings
