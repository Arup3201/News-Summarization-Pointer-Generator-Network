The screams emanating from a quiet north London fishmonger's this week weren't to do with the price of fish.

An extremely lifelike animatronic shark embedded on a fish counter alongside the fillets of salmon and haddock gave shoppers the shock of their lives when it started thrashing about.

Hidden cameras in Islington recorded the prank video dreamed up to promote 'ultimate B movie' Sharknado 2 ahead of its release.

In the video, the bloodthirsty beast let loose amid 
the catch of the day terrifies a series of shoppers quietly browsing for their fish supper.

The shark's razor-sharp teeth, glassy dead eyes and immense cavernous mouth fooled most of the people in the shop - bar an old lady, who strokes its head as she walks past.

The stunt from special effects producers at Syfy saw a team of four artists and animatronic wizards create the shark over two weeks.

Producers then placed hidden cameras in strategic locations throughout the 
shop, before launching their beast on some very surprised early morning 
shoppers.

Paramedics were on hand to deal with anyone who found the surprise too much, and shoppers scream, jump, laugh and even flee the shop in terror in the hilarious video.
