An British inventor has designed a new fridge that can keep live-saving vaccines cool for 35 days without power.

The appliance is designed for use in the developing world where some remote areas have no electricity, power cuts can be frequent and vaccines are vital for healthy communities.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated a $1.4million (£836,000) to help fridge company Sure Chill further develop the potentially life-saving design.

One cool idea: Inventor Ian Tansley (pictured left) developed the unique cooling technology
 which uses water to keep supplies of vaccines cool in remote 
medical centres (right). The Sure Chill fridges can keep its life-saving contents cool at a regular 4°C for up to 35 days - even if the temperature outside is as high as 43°C

At 4°C, water is at its heaviest and sinks. This explains why lakes can be frozen but fish can swim beneath the surface.

The same concept is used to create the fridge that adapts its temperature naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature - a constant 4°C even without power.

Water surrounds a Sure Chill refrigeration compartment. When the fridge is hooked up to a power source, the water cools and forms ice around the compartment to leave only water at four degrees cooling the contents.

However, when the power is turned off, the water warms and rises while the ice melts, so that only water at 4°C remains, cooling the contents of the compartment.

Ian Tansley of The Sure Chill Company, based in Snowdonia, North Wales, developed the unique cooling technology which uses water to keep supplies of vaccines cool in remote medical centres.

‘The devices will allow vaccines to be stored safely in challenging environments with no power and ambient temperatures as high as 43°C,’ he said.

‘Conventional refrigeration technologies can put vaccines at risk of either freezing or getting too warm.’

‘Our technology ensures that vaccines reach children in the best condition possible and has the potential to save the lives of countless children across the world.’

At 4°C water sinks and this scientific fact inspired Mr Tansley to create the new refrigeration system that adapts its temperature naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature - a constant 4°C  even without power. This temperature is perfect for storing food and vaccines.

Changing lives: The $1.4million (£836,000) cash from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will enable the Welsh firm to start field trials in East and West Africa for the new coolers within the next year. Here, a different model is moved into place at a remote health centre

It works because water surrounds a Sure Chill refrigeration compartment. When the fridge is hooked up to a power source, the water cools and forms ice around the compartment to leave only water at 4°C, cooling the contents.

However, when the power is turned off, the water warms and rises while the ice melts, so that still only water at 4°C remains cooling the contents of the compartment.

The company said that its fridge has ‘its own internal and entirely natural energy store that maintains a completely steady temperature. The system can operate like this, without power, for days and weeks.’

The invention has received financial backing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to transform people’s lives who are living in poverty without access to adequate healthcare.

The $1.4million (£836,000) cash injection will enable the Welsh firm to start field trials in East and West Africa for the new coolers within the next year.

The firm already has 10-day vaccine refrigerators operating in over 30 countries - and is recognised by the World Health Organisation.

It shipped 200 devices to the Philippines at the beginning of this year to help Unicef in the wake of Super Typhoon Haiyan.

Good things come in small packages: The firm already has 10-day vaccine refrigerators operating in over 30 countries - and is recognised by the World Health Organisation. It is also developing a small vaccine cooler (pictured) that is more portable and could be taken to remote areas in an emergency
