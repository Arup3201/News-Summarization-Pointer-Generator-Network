A devoutly Christian Washington state couple who went on the run with their children amid an ongoing custody dispute with Child Protective Services have been found in California, with the mother arrested for allegedly headbutting and kicking officers.

CPS went to the Bellingham address of Cleve Goheen-Rengo, 23, and Erica Carey, 29, on January 28 to take their three young children into protective custody following numerous welfare concerns over a chaotic home life, however the family had fled.

The couple - who hit headlines last year after saying they lost custody of their newborn twins for delivering them via homebirth with no assistance - were not officially wanted, but a 'Be On The Lookout' had been issued  to  law enforcement across the West Coast, according to KSBW.

Local news outlets also ran the notice, and a member of the public spotted the family at a gas station in Aptos, south of San Francisco, on Thursday and called police.

Tracked down: Washington couple Cleave Rengo and Erica Carey were found in California on Thursday - along with their three young children - after going on the run. They had lost custody of their kids for a second time

'Holistic Christian lifestyle': Erica Carey, 29, was arrested after being tracked down on Thursday after 'head-butting a sergeant', 'kicking a sheriff' and screaming for help from Jesus

Highway patrol and Santa Cruz County Sheriff's deputies seized upon the gas station and found the family.

The children - three-month-old twins Moran Kai and Daniel and one-year-old son Levi - were not harmed.

Erica Carey was arrested, however, for allegedly attacking police. 

'She head-butted one of our sergeants and kicked a sheriff's deputy,' CHP Officer Brad Sadek told KSBW. 

Carey also reportedly screamed out for Jesus and told a local cameraman: 'Send a message to America for me. Children don't belong to the government. The government belongs to the people.'

The father was not arrested.

The three children have been placed in the care of Child Protective Services.

The children had been removed in November following the birth of the twins, amid reports they were underweight and going without proper medical care.

The couple claimed their refusal to travel to hospital with paramedics - who were called to the house after a neighbor called 911 over Carey's birthing cries - contributed to the CPS decision.

The state said the children were removed for health and domestic reasons and not because of the home birth.

One of the reasons was a refusal to treat their one-year-old son's eczema with proper medication, the state said.

Carey and Rengo say they live a 'holistic lifestyle based on their Christian beliefs', according to The Billingham Herald.

They admitted to only realizing they were having twins after the birth of the first baby, having not had one ultrasound.

The children were returned in December, however the were still under state protection, so would be checked upon regularly.

Carey and Rengo were also ordered to undergo counseling.   

Commissioner Thomas Verge told Rengo, 23 and Carey, 29, that the couple's religious beliefs had caused a chaotic home life for their children.

He said that if the state believes the children's lives are in danger again they will be removed.

'This is about second chances because you blew the first one,' said Verge to the couple according to The Herald.

But Verge also pointed out he could see the 'love you both have for your children.'

Unconventional: Erica May Carey, 29 and Cleave Rengo, 23, are common-law husband and wife

When the CPS heard of the verdict they said, 'We accept this ruling and will work with the family to provide them with services aimed at helping keep the children safe in their home.'

The court removed one-year-old, Levi and twins Moran Kai and Daniel, on November 5.

In his verdict to return the children, Verge said that the home-birth, 'has no bearing whatsoever on my decision here.'

During the case which was heard in court in December, the state 'attempted to show an unstable household marked by numerous contacts with law enforcement … within the past two years and refusal to provide medical treatment to the children,' according to the Bellingham Herald. 

It was only after the couple, who are common-law married in Washington because they have never got a marriage license, decided to have their home birth that the CPS became involved.

'I’ve done a lot of research about other women who have done it and they said the spiritual experience was so much more wholesome. It was just us. We wanted to preserve that sanctity and sacredness in our birth,' said Carey as she justified her decision to give birth at home.

The CPS began showing up at their home after the 911 call in November and said that after they took custody of the children after one-year-old Levi developed pneumonia and ear infections.

Assistant Attorney General Rob Olson told the Washington court that law enforcement have been in contact with the famiy 21 times since 2013.

The calls related to refusal to provide medical care for their children, with concerns they were underweight and domestic issues between the couple, such as Rengo's mental health and bipolar disorder.

However, Christina Nelson-King, the attorney for the couple argued that 'Most of the safety risk was primarily speculative,' according to the Bellingham Herald.

Alternative: Erica Carey, seen here with son Levi, 1, admitted she did not know she was carrying twins until she gave birth in November because she had never had an ultrasound 

'Parents have a Constitutional right to parent as they see fit,' Nelson-King added.

However, he criticized them for their attitude towards the CPS which he said was doing its job properly.

'They did exactly what they should do,' he said, adding that they tried everything to help the family and were met by resistance. 'Their lives are dedicated to children. They are not the enemy. They are the heroes.'

Washingon Governor, Jay Inslee waded into the controversial case  to recognize the support the Rengo family received last year.

'I want to thank you for your concern and willingness to be vocal,' said Governor Jay Inslee on his official Facebook page.

The Governor also sought to clarify any rumors surrounding the removal of the children by social services.

'I’d like to be clear: every child’s safety is our top priority in situations like these. Rumors have circulated that the removal of the Rengo children was due to breastfeeding or their home births,' wrote Inslee.

'Those rumors are false. Breastfeeding and home birthing are not factors that would cause CPS to take children from a home. Their removal from the home was based on factors unrelated to a home birth or breastfeeding.'
