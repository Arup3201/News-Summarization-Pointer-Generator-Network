The biggest shake-up of the welfare state in British history comes today as a wide range of cost-cutting austerity measures take effect for the first time.

The Coalition is hoping to save billions of pounds by slashing legal aid, limiting benefits handouts and restructuring the NHS.

The average family is set to be £5,000 worse-off than at the time of the last election - but Government ministers insist their reforms will make the system 'fairer'.

Cost-cutting: George Osborne steps up his austerity programme today with wide-ranging benefit cuts

While critics have accused the Coalition of targeting poor families and the disabled while handing millionaires a tax cut, top officials dismiss the claims as 'shrill'.

George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith today said that their welfare changes were not 'the beginning of the end of the world'.

They continued: 'In reality, we are just restoring the original principles of the welfare state: that those who can work must work, and a life on benefits must not be more attractive than working.'

'Bedroom tax' comes into effect today

Perhaps the most controversial move is the so-called 'bedroom tax', which will see social housing tenants with spare rooms docked an average of £14 a week in benefits.

Around 660,000 people are set to lose some of their housing benefit from the change, which is expected to save the Government £465million a year.

The charge is aimed at reducing over-crowding in social housing and directing benefits towards those who are most in need.

But Labour has relentless attacked the move, with shadow chancellor Ed Balls denouncing it as 'possibly the worst, most cack-handed and massively unfair piece of policy-making I've ever seen'.

Legal aid cut drastically from today

Financial help in the legal system is set to be restricted to those whose household income is less than £32,000, with means-testing for all but the poorest claimants.

Divorce cases, personal injury and immigration appeals will no longer be covered by legal aid, meaning that experts expect a spike in the number of plaintiffs who will represent themselves in court.

The aim is to cut the £2.2billion legal aid bill by at least £350million.

NHS commissioning changes today

After nearly three years of wrangling, the National Health Service faces its widest-ranging reforms ever today, with commissioning handed over to consortiums of GPs.

Private companies will be allowed to compete to provide state-funded services for the first time, which ministers hope will drive down costs in the NHS.

The abolition of strategic health authorities and primary care trusts is expected to save £1.4billion in the short term with savings rising to £5billion by the time of the next election in 2015.

Council tax benefit cut from today

Council tax refunds for low-income households will today be transferred from the Department of Work and Pensions into the control of local councils.

Officials are using the switch as an opportunity to cut the size of the benefit by 10 per cent, saving as much as half a billion pounds a year.

In additions, 2.4million families will have their council tax bill raised, despite the Coalition's attempts to keep the cost of the tax down.

Out of work: The changes are aimed at forcing the jobless back into employment

50p tax rate abolished on Saturday

This weekend, high earners will find have the rate of tax charged on earnings over £100,000 cut from 50p to 45p.

Mr Osborne announced the move in last year's Budget in a bid to make Britain more business-friendly, claiming the 50p rate had raised £15billion less than expected.

However, Labour has denounced it as a millionaires' tax cut, with 13,000 of the super-rich saving £100,000 each.

Benefit 'uprating' starts a week on Monday

Next Monday, benefits will see their annual rise - but they will be increased by just one per cent, which is lower than the rate of inflation.

The Coalition has limited the rise in benefits for the next three years due to the slow rate of wages growth, claiming it is unfair for the unemployed to see their earnings rise faster than those in work.

The measure is supposed to save £505million this year, with further savings for as long as it remains in place.

Disability living allowance abolished next Monday

On the same day, disability living allowance will be replaced by personal independence payment.

The idea is to correlate benefits payments more closely to the needs of the disabled - so they will no longer be determined by claimants' medical conditions, but by how their disability affects what they can do.

But campaigners are concerned that the change will provide an excuse to limit payouts to the disabled in order to save money.

Benefit cap begins on April 15

The centrepiece of the Coalition's welfare reforms is the promise to limit each family's handouts to the average household income.

The scheme will be piloted in four London boroughs from April 15, and it is set to take effect throughout the country by the end of September.

No household will be entitled to receive more than £26,000 in benefits each year, although working tax credits are not included in the total.

Universal credit rolls out on April 28

Six of the main benefits payments are being integrated into a single system, starting with a trial scheme in Aston-under-Lyne from April 28.

The move is supposed to simplify the process of paying and receiving benefits, and make it easier to job-seekers to find work.

Changes set to leave families £5,000 poorer overall

Overall, a family earning a total of £34,000 will have lost £4,747 this year compared to three years ago, according to think-tank the Resolution Foundation.

Despite a rise in the personal income tax allowance which will save most people around £270 a year, cuts to working tax credit, child benefit and child tax credit will leave most households worse off.

The allowance - the amount of money on which no tax is due - will rise from £8,105 to £9,440 in the coming tax year as part of a major Coalition policy inspired by the Liberal Democrats.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Osborne and Mr Duncan Smith said: 'Our changes will ensure that the welfare state offers the right help to those who need it, and is fair to those who pay for it.

'Of course, if you listened to the shrill voices of the Left you'd think that every change to the welfare system, and any attempt to save money, marks the beginning of the end of the world.

'In reality, we are just restoring the original principles of the welfare state: that those who can work must work, and a life on benefits must not be more attractive than working.'

Ending what ministers call a 'spare room subsidy' would address the 'scandal' of a million people living in overcrowded conditions and millions more on waiting lists, they added.

But shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: 'This wicked bedroom tax is going to rip neighbour from neighbour, force vulnerable people to food banks and loan sharks, and end up costing Britain more than it saves as tenants are forced to go homeless or move into the expensive private rented sector.

'It is the worst possible blend of cruelty and incompetence. The Government must think again and drop this tax now.'

Pensions Minister Steve Webb insisted the highest earners had taken the biggest hit, telling ITV1's Daybreak this morning: 'We are trying to make savings but we're also trying to protect the most vulnerable.

'We're not saying you can't have a spare bedroom, what we are saying is you contribute £2 a day on average if you have that extra bedroom. Some people, yes money's tight, but will say £2 a day for a spare bedroom is worth paying, others will swap with others into smaller accommodation.'
