Step aside Gisele Bündchen and Alessandra Ambrosio - there's a new Brazilian beauty queen in town.

At the age of 65, glamorous grandmother Irenilda de Oliveira Meneses is giving her younger counterparts a run for their money, after being crowned Brazil's most beautiful elderly woman.

Clad in a floor-length green gown, the elegant blonde - nicknamed 'Barbie' by her friends - said she was 'swept away' by her victory at the pageant in Sao Paulo.

Ms de Oliveira Meneses was one of 25 finalists selected from 200 entrants to compete in the pageant, which was open to women aged 60 and over and timed to coincide with Mother's Day.

The contest saw women aged up to 87 judged on criteria including their smile, congeniality and elegance.

Married mother of two Ms de Oliveira Meneses, who has two grandsons, said: 
'We came out here to dance, to have fun, to parade around, and we 
succeeded; it’s really emotional, very emotional.

'I am so swept away, I 
am speechless. I am still speechless,' the grandmother said in a report on ChannelsTV.com.

The oldest beauty queen in the 
competition, 87-year-old Maria Helena Fernandes, said the pageant had 
made her feel 'like a 20-year-old girl'.
