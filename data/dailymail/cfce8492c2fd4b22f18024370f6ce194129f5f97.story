George Osborne and Ed Balls will join the chiefs of Amazon and Google at a secretive conference, it was revealed last night, as both firms face mounting pressure over their tax avoidance strategies.

The Chancellor and his Labour shadow will attend the Bilderberg Conference at the five-star Grove Hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire, along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt of Google.

Their names were revealed in a list of 140 politicians, academics and businessmen - including only 14 women - who will this week discuss topics such as ‘cyber warfare’ and ‘jobs, entitlement and debt’.

Bilderberg - which will also be attended by former Barclays chairman Marcus Agius - has a shadowy reputation which has come under scrutiny in recent years, forcing organisers to be more open.

Also attending the event will be former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger, former Labour minister Lord Mandelson, Cabinet minister Ken Clarke and former foreign secretary Lord Carrington.

A Bilderberg spokesman said in a press release: ‘The conference has always been a forum for informal, off-the-record discussions about megatrends and the major issues facing the world.

‘Thanks to the private nature of the conference, the participants are not bound by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed positions. As such, they can take time to listen, reflect and gather insights.’

The conference was founded in 1954 as an annual event designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. Between 120 and 150 people take part each year.

They will also debate subjects including
 ‘can the U.S. and Europe grow faster and create jobs’, ‘how big data is
 changing almost everything’, ‘U.S. foreign policy’ and ‘Africa’s 
challenges’.

Last week it was revealed British 
taxpayers will have to foot the bill for the ‘exceptional costs’ of 
policing the clandestine meeting, which is taking place in Britain for 
the first time since 1998.

Given the amount of prestigious names set to attend the event at the luxury hotel, local police have been forced to step up security, which will be part-funded by the government.

The cloak of secrecy surrounding the meetings, which ban most journalists from attending, has fuelled various conspiracy theories, including that attendees are plotting world domination.

As a result, there are fears that anti-capitalist protesters will cause ‘violence and disturbance’.

Google has come under fire in recent weeks over reports that it paid just £10million in corporation tax in Britain between 2006 and 2011, despite revenues of £11.9billion.

Amazon said it paid just £2.44million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year - but told investors it in fact turned over 13 times that amount, with British sales of more than £4billion.
