For this luxury treetop property near Honiton, Devon, is being rented for £200 a night and is proving popular with couples who want to branch out when it comes to a secluded romantic break.

The Acorn Treehouse near Honiton, Devon, costs £200 a night and has proved popular with couples seeking seclusion during their romantic getaway

Nestled in the middle of a forest, it has an outdoor area where guests can get close to nature and enjoy the surrounding wildlife

The secluded hideaway, deep in a 
forest, is one of only a handful of treehouses in the country which can 
be rented and slept in overnight.

Since it opened a year ago, three lovestruck couples have got engaged while staying there.

It was handbuilt by a farmer and his son then installed in the branches of an oak tree in a small area of forest on their 40-acre farm.

The only part of the treehouse which isn't made from wood is its metal spiral staircase.

The structure boasts two rooms - one main room with a comfy sofa, double bed and fully-stocked kitchen, and another with a shower, toilet and wash basin.

It even has a balcony for romantic evenings watching the sunset.

Those staying in the luxury accommodation can also enjoy a view of the treeline and take in the sunset from a balcony

The whole treehouse is built out of wood, except for the metal spiral staircase leading up to the entrance

Tim Rees, director of Quality Unearthed who rent the property, said: 'The Acorn Treehouse is very popular indeed and it's not hard to see why.

'It brings childhood memories of treehouses flooding back. It's not about going back to nature - it's about going forward to nature.

'You're high up in the trees, secluded among the foliage, but at the same time you have all the comforts of a bed, a kitchen, a bathroom and a wood burner.

'It was built by a farmer and his son on a small patch of woodland on their farm. Every last piece was hand built by them.

'It's great for honeymoons, mini moons and weekend getaways. It's so romantic that since it was launched there have been three marriage proposals there.

'It ticks all the boxes and it is in a beautiful part of the country.'

It boasts a television, a sofa, a woodburning stove and a kitchen complete with a microwave, sink and hob

A double bed is nestled in the corner of the room, which is lined with hardwood flooring. An oak branch feeds through the roof
