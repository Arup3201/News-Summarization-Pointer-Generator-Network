Officials at the University of Maryland announced Wednesday that a data breach has compromised more than 300,000 records for any faculty members, staff or students who have received a university ID card.

It's not only current students and employees who need to worry - according to the university, the breach has compromised records dating back to 1998.

The attack occurred about 4 a.m. Tuesday when an outside hacker gained access to a secure records database that holds Social Security numbers, dates of birth and university 
identification numbers for 309,079 people affiliated with the school at 
its College Park and Shady Grove campuses.

In a statement issued Wednesday, university President Wallace D. Loh said university officials currently are investigating how such a breach was possible, and what the plan is going forward to make sure that it doesn't happen again.

'Appropriate state and federal law enforcement authorities are currently
 investigating this incident,' Loh said in the statement. 'Computer forensic 
investigators are examining the breached files and logs to determine how
 our sophisticated, multi-layered security defenses were bypassed.'

Vast: The university says the hacker gained access to private information of more than 300,000 people

Brian Voss, vice president and chief information officer for the university, told the Washington Post that the hackers didn't change anything within the university's computer systems. However, he says, they essentially 'made a Xerox of it and took off.'

Voss says that what concerns him the most is the level of sophistication the hacker - or hackers - used to gain access to the university's private records.

Voss says that the breach isn't like most cyber attacks, where 'someone left the door open' allowing an easy way in for any average hacker.

Damage control: University President Wallace D. Loh says the university will provide credit monitoring for anyone whose information was compromised

'That’s not what happened here,' Voss said. 'There’s no open door. These
 people picked through several locks to get to this data.'

In his statement, Loh apologized for the breach, noting that 'computer and data security are a very high priority of our University.'

Additionally, Loh says the university will provide free credit monitoring for a year for anyone whose information was hacked.
