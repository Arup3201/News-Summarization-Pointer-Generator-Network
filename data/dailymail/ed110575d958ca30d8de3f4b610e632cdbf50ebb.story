New Huddersfield manager Chris Powell wants football's governing bodies to do more to create opportunities for black coaches.

The former Charlton boss is currently the only black manger in the top four divisions after replacing Mark Robins at the Terriers helm on Wednesday.

In recent seasons Chris Hughton, Paul Ince, Chris Kiwomya, Keith Curle and Terry Connor have all managed in the Football League but none of them are currently a number one.

And while Powell believes that any appointments made by clubs should be on merit, he is eager to see more black coaches given the chance to thrive in management.

'It doesn't look great, but all you can do is get your badges and become as qualified as you can,' he told the Sunday Mirror.

'I believe that all the governing bodies should get together to reach agreement about how to move forward. People like myself, Chris Hughton, Chris Kiwomya and Paul Ince, we've all proven that we can manage. We are all role models.

'Only one of us is working in the professional game at the moment. My appointment here, and all our track records, show that we can take positions of responsibility and be successful.

'Chris was successful at Norwich, Birmingham and Newcastle. I was also PFA chairman for five years, so I can lead people.

'I can't answer for people who run football clubs. You can only apply for jobs, then do them to the best of your ability. You have to be good at your job.

'But the FA and Premier League and other bodies should try and agree to implement measures that will help.'

In American football, the Rooney rule requires teams to interview 'minority' candidates for all head coaching positions and Powell believes it is vital black coaches are given more interview opportunities.

'It ensures that black and minority ethnic coaches are getting interviewed,' he said. 'But it's not a question of whether I want it. It's a question of whether all football's governing bodies can all agree to it.

'It's about giving people a chance to get interviews in the first place but then it's still up to you to prove you are the right person.'

He added: 'You always have to prove you are the best. If people reject you for whatever reasons it should never dissuade you from keeping on trying.

'People like Paul Ince, Chris Hughton and Chris Kiwomya are good managers, who happen to be black. I believe football is trying to move forward on this.'
