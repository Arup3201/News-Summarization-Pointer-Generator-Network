Adidas has launched a new running shoe with new technology they say will revolutionise running.

The sportswear giant say the £110 Boost, which has added bounce built into its soles, is their most advanced to date.

The footwear contains a new material - dubbed 'energy capsules' that are melted and built into the sole. The bouncy material returns more energy to the runner - meaning the wearer can run more efficiently on the roads and go for longer without expending as much energy.

Added bounce: adidas say their new £110 Boost shoe will revolutionise the way people run - allowing them to go further more efficiently

Thousands of the special energy capsules 
are melted together into one midsole that adidas say will 'change your run forever.'

'The Energy Boost, is designed to show 
off the high energy return and the extremely soft cushioning. When you 
try this trainer on, you'll know your way of running has changed for 
good,' they say.

The lightweight shoe will be launched on 27 February with just one design - a minimalist black and yellow - though other variations will follow, including a professional athletes' version to be worn for the 2013 London Marathon by Kenyan runner Wilson Kipsang, winner of the
2012 event.

The Energy Boost is the first running shoe from adidas to be equipped with the revolutionary technology, but the brand says it will not be the last.

'This is only the start of the running revolution,' they said.

Gerd Ganz, senior innovation director for adidas, told Metro yesterday at a demonstration for the product that he worked with chemicals giant BASF to develop the product over three years.

Hi-tech: The Boost shoe was three years in development and uses new 'energy capsule' technology to give the midsole of the shoe unprecedented bounce

Showing that a metal ball would bounce of the sole of a Boost trained more than 60cm (2ft) higher than material used in other trainers, he told how the innovation was developed.

'We knew that if we could find a way to use the material's potential in midsoles, we would have a game changer on our hands,' he said.

Market analysts told Metro yesterday that this new products is a much-needed addition to the adidas line, given the fact that Nike holds a 54 per cent share of the running shoe market in the U.S. compared to the 4.4 per cent market share held by adidas.

The Boost is said to be a response to Nike's LunarGlide range.
